For any E_\infty ring spectrum E, we show that there is an algebra \mathrm{Pow}(E) of stable power operations that acts naturally on the underlying spectrum of any E-algebra. Further, we show that there are maps of rings E \to \mathrm{Pow}(E) \to \mathrm{End}(E), where the latter determines a restriction from power operations to stable operations in the cohomology of spaces. In the case where E is the mod-p Eilenberg-Mac Lane spectrum, this realizes a natural quotient from Mandell's algebra of generalized Steenrod operations to the mod-p Steenrod algebra. More generally, this arises as part of a classification of endomorphisms of representable functors from an \infty-category \mathcal{C} to spectra, with particular attention to the case where \mathcal{C} is an \mathcal{O}-monoidal \infty-category.
