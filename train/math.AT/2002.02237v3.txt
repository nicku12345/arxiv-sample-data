In topological data analysis, the stability of persistent diagrams gives the foundation for the persistent homology method. In this paper, we use the embedded homology and the homology of associated simplicial complexes to define the persistent diagram for a hypergraph. Then we prove the stability of this persistent diagram. We generalize the persistent diagram method and define persistent diagrams for a homomorphism between two modules. Then we prove the stability of the persistent diagrams of the pull-back filtration and the push-forward filtration on hypergraphs, induced by a morphism between two hypergraphs.
