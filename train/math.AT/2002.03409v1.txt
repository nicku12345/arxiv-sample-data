Motivated by applications in Topological Data Analysis, we consider decompositions of a simplicial complex induced by a cover of its vertices. We study how the homotopy type of such decompositions approximates the homotopy of the simplicial complex itself. The difference between the simplicial complex and such an approximation is quantitatively measured by means of the so called obstruction complexes. Our general machinery is then specialized to clique complexes, Vietoris-Rips complexes and Vietoris-Rips complexes of metric gluings. For the latter we give metric conditions which allow to recover the first and zero-th homology of the gluing from the respective homologies of the components.
