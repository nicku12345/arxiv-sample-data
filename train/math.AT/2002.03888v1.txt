In this article we discuss Bousfield localization, beginning with definitions in terms of mapping spaces and working up to a discussion of how they can be constructed when we have access to the small object argument. We also discuss Bousfield localization in the presence of multiplicative structure. Our goal is to place an emphasis on examples of various types.   This is an expository article, written to be part of an upcoming book.
