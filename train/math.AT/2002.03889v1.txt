This is an expository article about power operations and their connection with the study of highly structured ring spectra. In particular, we discuss Dyer-Lashof operations and their evolving role in the study of iterated loop spaces, E_n-algebras, and E_n-ring spectra. We will make use of these operations to show that structured ring spectra are heavily constrained. We also discuss some ongoing directions for study.   This is a preliminary version of a chapter written for the Handbook of Homotopy Theory.
