This note contains a generalization to p>2 of the authors' previous calculations of the coefficients of (\mathbb{Z}/2)^n-equivariant ordinary cohomology with coefficients in the constant \mathbb{Z}/2-Mackey functor. The algberaic results by S.Kriz allow us to calculate the coefficients of the geometric fixed point spectrum \Phi^{(\mathbb{Z}/p)^n}H\mathbb{Z}/p, and more generally, the \mathbb{Z}-graded coefficients of the localization of H\mathbb{Z}/p_{(\mathbb{Z}/p)^n} by inverting any chosen set of embeddings S^0\rightarrow S^{\alpha_i} where \alpha_i are non-trivial irreducible representations. We also calculate the RO(G)^+-graded coefficients of H\mathbb{Z}/p_{(\mathbb{Z}/p)^n}, which means the cohomology of a point indexed by an actual (not virtual) representation. (This is the "non-derived" part, which has a nice algebraic description.)
