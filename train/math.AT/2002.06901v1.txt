In this paper, complex vector bundles of rank r over 8-dimensional spin^{c} manifolds are classified in terms of the Chern classes of the complex vector bundles and the cohomology ring of the manifolds, where r = 3 or 4. As an application, we got that two rank 3 complex vector bundles over 4-dimensional complex projective spaces \C P^{4} are isomorphic if and only if they have the same Chern classes. Moreover, the Chern classes of rank 3 complex vector bundles over \C P^{4} are determined. Combing Thomas's and Switzer's results with our work, we can assert that complex vector bundles over \C P^{4} are all classified.
