Let (X,J)  be an almost complex manifold with a (smooth) involution \sigma:X\to X such that Fix(\sigma)\neq \emptyset. Assume that \sigma is a complex conjugation, i.e, the differential of \sigma anti-commutes with J. The space P(m,X):=\mathbb{S}^m\times X/\!\sim where (v,x)\sim (-v,\sigma(x)) is known as a generalized Dold manifold. Suppose that a group G\cong \mathbb Z_2^s acts smoothly on X such that g\circ \sigma =\sigma\circ g for all g\in G. Using the action of the diagonal subgroup D=O(1)^{m+1}\subset O(m+1) on the sphere \mathbb S^{m} for which there are only finitely many pairs of antipodal points that are stablized by D, we obtain an action of \mathcal G=D\times G on \mathbb S^m\times X, which descends to a (smooth) action of \mathcal G on P(m,X). When the stationary point set X^G for the G action on X is finite, the same also holds for the \mathcal G action on P(m,X). The main result of this note is that the equivariant cobordism class [P(m,X),\mathcal G] vanishes if and only if [X,G] vanishes. We illustrate this result in the case when X is the complex flag manifold, \sigma is the natural complex conjugation and G\cong (\mathbb Z_2)^n is contained in the diagonal subgroup of U(n).
