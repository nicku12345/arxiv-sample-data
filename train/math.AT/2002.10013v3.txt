Vietoris-Rips and degree Rips complexes are represented as homotopy types by their underlying posets of simplices, and basic homotopy stability theorems are recast in these terms. These homotopy types are viewed as systems (or functors), which are defined on a parameter space. The category of systems of spaces admits a partial homotopy theory that is based on controlled equivalences, suitably defined, that are the output of homotopy stability results.
