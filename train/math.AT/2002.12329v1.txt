We give explicit formulae for differential graded Lie algebra (DGLA) models of 3-cells. In particular, for a cube and an n-faceted banana-shaped 3-cell with two vertices, n edges each joining those two vertices and n bi-gon 2-cells, we construct a model symmetric under the geometric symmetries of the cell fixing two antipodal vertices. The cube model is to be used in forthcoming work for discrete analogues of differential geometry on cubulated manifolds.
