The loop product is an operation in string topology. Cohen and Jones gave a homotopy theoretic realization of the loop product as a classical ring spectrum LM^{-TM} for a manifold M. Using this, they presented a proof of the statement that the loop product is isomorphic to the Gerstenhaber cup product on the Hochschild cohomology HH^*(C^*(M)\,;C^*(M)) for simply connected M. However, some parts of their proof is technically difficult to justify. The main aim of the present paper is to give detailed modification to a geometric part of their proof. To do so, we set up an "up to higher homotopy" version of McClure-Smith's cosimplicial product. We prove a structured version of Cohen-Jones isomorphism in the category of symmetric spectra.
