We study the orientability of vector bundles with respect to a family of cohomology theories called \mathrm{EO}-theories. The \mathrm{EO}-theories are higher height analogues of real \mathrm{K}-theory \mathrm{KO}. For each \mathrm{EO}-theory, we prove that the direct sum of i copies of any vector bundle is \mathrm{EO}-orientable for some specific integer i. Using the splitting principal, we reduce to the case of the canonical line bundle over \mathbb{CP}^{\infty}. Our method involves understanding the action of an order p subgroup of the Morava stabilizer group on the Morava \mathrm{E}-theory of \mathbb{CP}^{\infty}. Our calculations have another application: We determine the homotopy type of the \mathrm{S}^1-Tate spectrum associated to the trivial action of \mathrm{S}^1 on all \mathrm{EO}-theories.
