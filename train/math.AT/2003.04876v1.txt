We examine the rationality conjecture which states that (a) the formal power series \sum_{r\ge 1} \tc_{r+1}(X)\cdot x^r represents a rational function of x with a single pole of order 2 at x=1 and (b) the leading coefficient of the pole equals \cat(X). Here X is a finite CW-complex and for r\ge 2 the symbol \tc_r(X) denotes its r-th sequential topological complexity. We analyse an example (violating the Ganea conjecture) and conclude that part (b) of the rationality conjecture is false in general. Besides, we establish a cohomological version of the rationality conjecture.
