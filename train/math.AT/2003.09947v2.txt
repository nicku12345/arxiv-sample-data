Suppose F is a special Gamma-space equipped with a natural transformation to the infinite symmetric power functor. Segal's infinite loop space machine associates with F a spectrum, denoted kF, equipped with a map to the integral Eilenberg-Mac Lane spectrum. In our previous work we constructed a filtration of kF by a sequence of spectra, which we called the "stable rank filtration of F". In this paper we give a new construction of the stable rank filtration. The new construction is combinatorial in nature and avoids the process of stabilization. In particular, we construct a sequence of special Gamma-spaces whose group completion yields the stable rank filtration.
