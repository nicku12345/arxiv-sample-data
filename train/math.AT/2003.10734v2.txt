In this paper, we extend a result of Lafont and M{\'e}tayer and prove that the polygraphic homology of a small category, defined in terms of polygraphic resolutions in the category \omegaCat of strict \omega-categories, is naturally isomorphic to the homology of its nerve. Along the way, we prove some results on homotopy colimits with respect to the Folk model structure and deduce a theorem which formally resembles Quillen's Theorem A.
