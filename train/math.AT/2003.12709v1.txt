The use of Cauchy's method in proving the well-known Euler formula is an object of many controversies. The purpose of this paper is to prove that the Cauchy's method applies for convex polyhedra and not only for them, but also for surfaces such as the torus, the projective plane, the Klein bottle and the pinched torus.
