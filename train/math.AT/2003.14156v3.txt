In the paper "The Steenrod algebra and its dual", J.Milnor determined the structure of the dual Steenrod algebra which is a graded commutative Hopf algebra of finite type. We consider the affine group scheme G_p represented by the dual Hopf algebra of the mod p Steenrod algebra. Then, G_p assigns a graded commutative algebra A_* over a prime field of finite characteristic p to a set of isomorphisms of the additive formal group law over A_*, whose group structure is given by the composition of formal power series. The aim of this paper is to show some group theoretic properties of G_p by making use of this presentation of G_p(A_*). We give a decreasing filtration of subgroup schemes of G_p which we use for estimating the length of the lower central series of finite subgroup schemes of G_p. We also give a successive quotient maps G_p\xrightarrow{\rho_0}G_p^{\langle1\rangle}\xrightarrow{\rho_1}G_p^{\langle2\rangle}\xrightarrow{\rho_2}\cdots\xrightarrow{\rho_{k-1}} G_p^{\langle k\rangle}\xrightarrow{\rho_k}G_p^{\langle k+1\rangle}\xrightarrow{\rho_{k+1}}\cdots of affine group schemes over a prime field {\boldsymbol F}_p such that the kernel of \rho_k is a maximal abelian subgroup.
