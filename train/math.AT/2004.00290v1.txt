Given pointed CW-complexes X and Y, \rmph(X, Y) denotes the set of homotopy classes of phantom maps from X to Y and \rmsph(X, Y) denotes the subset of \rmph(X, Y) consisting of homotopy classes of special phantom maps. In a preceding paper, we gave a sufficient condition such that \rmph(X, Y) and \rmsph(X, Y) have natural group structures and established a formula for calculating the groups \rmph(X, Y) and \rmsph(X, Y) in many cases where the groups [X,\Omega \widehat{Y}] are nontrivial. In this paper, we establish a dual version of the formula, in which the target is the total space of a fibration, to calculate the groups \rmph(X, Y) and \rmsph(X, Y) for pairs (X,Y) to which the formula or existing methods do not apply. In particular, we calculate the groups \rmph(X,Y) and \rmsph(X,Y) for pairs (X,Y) such that X is the classifying space BG of a compact Lie group G and Y is a highly connected cover Y' \langle n \rangle of a nilpotent finite complex Y' or the quotient \gbb / H of \gbb = U, O by a compact Lie group H.
