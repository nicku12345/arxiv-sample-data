We build model structures on the category of equivariant simplicial operads with weak equivalences determined by families of subgroups, in the context of operads with a varying set of colors (and building on the fixed color model structures in the prequel). In particular, by specifying to the family of graph subgroups (or, more generally, one of the indexing systems of Blumberg-Hill), we obtain model structures on the category of equivariant simplicial operads whose weak equivalences are determined by norm map data.
