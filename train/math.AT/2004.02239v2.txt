It has been shown that 1-dimensional persistence modules have a very simple classification, namely there is a discrete invariant called a barcode that completely characterizes 1-dimensional persistence modules up to isomorphism. Carlsson and Zomorodian showed that n-dimensional persistence modules have no such "nice" classification when n>1, in that every discrete invariant will necessarily be incomplete. Despite their incompleteness, discrete invariants still provide insight into the properties of multidimensional persistence modules. Let M denote an n-dimensional persistence module. We show connections between the multisets \xi_j(M) (defined by Carlsson and Zomorodian) and other discrete invariants. In particular, when n=2, given the barcode of certain short paths within M, we can recover the multisets \xi_j(M) for each j. The proof of this yields a simple combinatorial formula for determining \xi_j(M) for each j based on the barcodes of certain short paths within M. When n>2, we show a weaker result; \xi_0(M) can be recovered from restricting M to small subquivers. Lastly, for arbitrary n, we relate the dimension vector of M to the multisets \xi_j(M).
