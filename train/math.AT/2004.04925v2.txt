We examine the relation between the gauge groups of \mathrm{SU}(n)- and \mathrm{PU}(n)-bundles over S^{2i}, with 2\leq i\leq n, particularly when n is a prime. As special cases, for \mathrm{PU}(5)-bundles over S^4, we show that there is a rational or p-local equivalence \mathcal{G}_{2,k}\simeq_{(p)}\mathcal{G}_{2,l} for any prime p if, and only if, (120,k)=(120,l), while for \mathrm{PU}(3)-bundles over S^6 there is an integral equivalence \mathcal{G}_{3,k}\simeq\mathcal{G}_{3,l} if, and only if, (120,k)=(120,l).
