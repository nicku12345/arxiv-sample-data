The aim of this paper is to construct an E_\infty-operad \mathcal{R} and prove that this operad induces an E_\infty-coalgebra structure on chain complexes with coefficients in \mathbb{Z}. The operad \mathcal{R} is an alternative to the description of the E_\infty-coalgebra structure on chain complexes by the Barrat-Eccles operad.
