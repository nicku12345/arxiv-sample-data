We investigate implications of an old conjecture in unstable homotopy theory related to the Cohen-Moore-Neisendorfer theorem and a conjecture about the \mathbf{E}_{2}-topological Hochschild cohomology of certain Thom spectra (denoted A, B, and T(n)) related to Ravenel's X(p^n). We show that these conjectures imply that the orientations \mathrm{MSpin}\to \mathrm{ko} and \mathrm{MString}\to \mathrm{tmf} admit spectrum-level splittings. This is shown by generalizing a theorem of Hopkins and Mahowald, which constructs \mathrm{H}\mathbf{F}_p as a Thom spectrum, to construct \mathrm{BP}\langle{n-1}\rangle, \mathrm{ko}, and \mathrm{tmf} as Thom spectra (albeit over T(n), A, and B respectively, and not over the sphere). This interpretation of \mathrm{BP}\langle{n-1}\rangle, \mathrm{ko}, and \mathrm{tmf} offers a new perspective on Wood equivalences of the form \mathrm{bo} \wedge C\eta \simeq \mathrm{bu}: they are related to the existence of certain EHP sequences in unstable homotopy theory. This construction of \mathrm{BP}\langle{n-1}\rangle also provides a different lens on the nilpotence theorem. Finally, we prove a C_2-equivariant analogue of our construction, describing \underline{\mathrm{H}\mathbf{Z}} as a Thom spectrum.
