The mod 2 equivariant cohomology algebras of the classical configuration space F(\mathbb{R}^d,n) was described in an influential paper by Hung (1990). We show with a new, detailed proof that his main result is correct, but that the arguments that were given by Hung on the way to his result are not, as are some of the intermediate results in his paper.   This invalidates a paper by three of the present authors, Blagojevi\'c, L\"uck \& Ziegler (2016), who used a claimed intermediate result from Hung (1990) in order to derive lower bounds for the existence of k-regular and \ell-skew embeddings. Using our new proof for Hung's main result, we get new lower bounds for existence of highly regular embeddings: Some of them agree with the previously claimed bounds, some are weaker.
