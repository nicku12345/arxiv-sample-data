We construct a calculus of functors in the spirit of orthogonal calculus, which is designed to study "functors with reality" such as the Real classifying space functor, BU_\mathbb{R}(-). The calculus produces a Taylor tower, the n-th layer of which is classified by a spectrum with an action of C_2 \ltimes U(n).   We further give model categorical considerations, producing a zig-zag of Quillen equivalences between spectra with an action of C_2 \ltimes U(n) and a model structure on the category of input functors which captures the homotopy theory of the n-th layer of the Taylor tower.
