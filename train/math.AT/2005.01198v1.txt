A modern insight due to Quillen, which is further developed by Lurie, asserts that many cohomology theories of interest are particular cases of a single construction, which allows one to define cohomology groups in an abstract setting using only intrinsic properties of the category (or \infty-category) at hand. This universal cohomology theory is known as Quillen cohomology. This paper is devoted to the study of Quillen cohomology of enriched operads. Our main result provides an explicit formula for computing Quillen cohomology of enriched operads, based on a procedure of taking certain infinitesimal models of their cotangent complexes. Inspired by an idea of Lurie, we propose the construction of twisted arrow \infty-categories of simplicial operads. We then show that the cotangent complex of a simplicial operad can be represented as a spectrum valued functor on its twisted arrow \infty-category. As an illustration, we prove that Quillen cohomology of any little cubes operad, with certain coefficients, vanishes.
