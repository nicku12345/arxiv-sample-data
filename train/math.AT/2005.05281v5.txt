Closed (and simply-connected) manifolds whose dimensions are larger than 4 are classified via sophisticated algebraic and abstract theory such as surgery theory and homotopy theory. It is difficult to handle 3 or 4-dimensional closed manifolds in such ways. However, the latter work is, in geometric and constructive ways, not so difficult in a sense. The fact that the dimensions are not high enables us to handle the manifolds via diagrams for example. It is difficult to study higher dimensional manifolds in these ways, although it is natural and important. In the present paper, we present such studies via fold maps, which are higher dimensional versions of Morse functions. The author previously constructed fold maps on 7-dimensional closed and simply-connected manifolds satisfying additional conditions on cohomology rings, including exotic homotopy spheres. This paper presents fold maps on such manifolds of new classes.
