In [1] we introduced the notion of 'structured space', i.e. a space which locally resembles various algebraic structures. In [2] and [3] we studied some cohomology theories related to these space. In this paper we continue in this direction: while in [2] we mainly focused on cohomologies arising from f_s and h, and in [3] we considered cohomologies for generalisations of objects which involved structured spaces, here we deal with (co)homologies coming from the poset associated to a structured space via an equivalence relation defined at the end of Section 4 in [1]. More precisely, we will show that various (co)homologies for posets can also be applied (under some assumptions) to structured spaces.
