We establish a hidden extension in the Adams spectral sequence converging to the stable homotopy groups of spheres at the prime 2 in the 54-stem. This extension is exceptional in that the only proof we know proceeds via Pstragowski's category of synthetic spectra. This was the final unresolved hidden 2-extension in the Adams spectral sequence through dimension 80. We hope this provides a concise demonstration of the computational leverage provided by \mathbb{F}_2-synthetic spectra.
