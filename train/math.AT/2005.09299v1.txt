The present note presents some results about the mod-2 cohomology, modulo nilpotent elements elements of the fiber E of a decomposable map \psi : K(Z, 2) \rightarrow K(Z/2, p). This is more an announcement and a brief description of the tools that are used: Lannes' T functor and the Eilenberg-Moore spectral sequence.
