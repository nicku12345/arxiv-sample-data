Let \mathrm{TC}_r(X) denote the r-th topological complexity of a space X. In many cases, the generating function \sum_{r\ge 1}\mathrm{TC}_{r+1}(X)x^r is a rational function \frac{P(x)}{(1-x)^2} where P(x) is a polynomial with P(1)=\mathrm{cat}(X), that is, the asymptotic growth of \mathrm{TC}_r(X) with respect to r is \mathrm{cat}(X). In this paper, we introduce a lower bound \mathrm{MTC}_r(X) of \mathrm{TC}_r(X) for a rational space X, and estimate the growth of \mathrm{MTC}_r(X).
