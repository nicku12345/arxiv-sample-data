We show a number of Toda brackets in the homotopy of the motivic bordism spectrum MGL and of the Real bordism spectrum MU_{\mathbb R}. These brackets are "red-shifting" in the sense that while the terms in the bracket will be of some chromatic height n, the bracket itself will be of chromatic height (n+1). Using these, we deduce a family of exotic multiplications in the \pi_{(\ast,\ast)}MGL-module structure of the motivic Morava K-theories, including non-trivial multiplications by 2. These in turn imply the analogous family of exotic multiplications in the \pi_{\star}MU_\mathbb R-module structure on the Real Morava K-theories.
