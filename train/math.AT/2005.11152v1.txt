This note is purely expository and is an extended version of math review to the paper [AP19]=arXiv:1901.07918v3 by S. Abramyan and T. Panov published in Proc. of Steklov Math. Inst. 305 (2019). The authors construct simplicial complexes for whose moment-angle complexes certain homotopy classes are non-trivial. I present in a shorter and clearer way the main definition and the statement of Theorem 5.1 from [AP19]. The clarification reveals that the main definition used in the statements of the main results is not given [AP19].
