We propose a definition of persistent Stiefel-Whitney classes of vector bundle filtrations. It relies on seeing vector bundles as subsets of some Euclidean spaces. The usual \v{C}ech filtration of such a subset can be endowed with a vector bundle structure, that we call a \v{C}ech bundle filtration. We show that this construction is stable and consistent. When the dataset is a finite sample of a line bundle, we implement an effective algorithm to compute its persistent Stiefel-Whitney classes. In order to use simplicial approximation techniques in practice, we develop a notion of weak simplicial approximation. As a theoretical example, we give an in-depth study of the normal bundle of the circle, which reduces to understanding the persistent cohomology of the torus knot (1,2).
