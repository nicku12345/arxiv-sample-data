In this paper we construct a Chern character map from quasi-elliptic cohomology theory to Devoto's equivariant elliptic cohomology theory. Moreover, we construct twisted quasi-elliptic cohomology. To provide a geometric interpretation of it, we define a version of twisted equivariant loop space via bibundles. In addition, we construct a twisted Chern character map from it to twisted equivariant elliptic cohomology theory.
