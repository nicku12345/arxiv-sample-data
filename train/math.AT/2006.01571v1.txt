A dga model for the integral singular cochains on a moment-angle complex is given by the twisted tensor product of the corresponding Stanley-Reisner ring and an exterior algebra. We present a short proof of this fact and extend it to real moment-angle complexes. We also compare various descriptions of the cohomology rings of these spaces, including one stated without proof by Gitler and L\'opez de Medrano.
