It is a classical important problem of differential topology by Thom; for a homology class of a compact manifold, can we realize this by a closed submanifold with no boundary? This is true if the degree of the class is smaller or equal to the half of the dimension of the outer manifold under the condition that the coefficient ring is Z_2. If the degree of the class is smaller or equal to 6 or equal to k-2 or k-1 under the condition that the coefficient ring is the integer ring where k is the dimension of the manifold, then this is also true. As a specific study, for 4-dimensional closed manifolds, the topologies (genera) of closed and connected surfaces realizing given 2nd homology classes have been actively studied, for example.   In the present paper, we consider the following similar problem; can we realize a homology class of a compact manifold by a homology class of an explicit closed manifold embedded in the (interior of the) given compact manifold? This problem is considered as a variant of previous problems. We present an affirmative answer via important theory in the singularity theory of differentiable maps: lifting a given smooth map to an embedding or obtaining an embedding such that the composition of this with the canonical projection is the given map. Presenting this application of lifting smooth maps and related fundamental propositions is also a main purpose of the present paper.
