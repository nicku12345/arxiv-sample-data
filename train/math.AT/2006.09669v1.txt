The main objective of this paper is to compute RO(G)-graded cohomology of G-orbits for the group G=C_n, where n is a product of distinct primes. We compute these groups for the constant Mackey functor \underline{Z} and for the Burnside ring Mackey functor \underline{A}. Among other things, we show that the groups \underline{H}^\alpha_G(S^0) are mostly determined by the fixed point dimensions of the virtual representations \alpha, except in the case of \underline{A} coefficients when the fixed point dimensions of \alpha have many zeros. In the case of \underline{Z} coefficients, the ring structure on the cohomology is also described. The calculations are then used to prove freeness results for certain G-complexes.
