The Stolz--Teichner program proposes a deep connection between geometric field theories and certain cohomology theories. In this paper, we extend this connection by developing a theory of geometric power operations for geometric field theories restricted to closed bordisms. These operations satisfy relations analogous to the ones exhibited by their homotopical counterparts. We also provide computational tools to identify the geometrically defined operations with the usual power operations on complexified equivariant K-theory. Further, we use the geometric approach to construct power operations for complexified equivariant elliptic cohomology.
