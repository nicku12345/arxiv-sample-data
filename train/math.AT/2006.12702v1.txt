We construct the stable (representable) homotopy category of finite orbispectra, whose objects are formal desuspensions of finite orbi-CW-pairs by vector bundles and whose morphisms are stable homotopy classes of (representable) relative maps. The stable representable homotopy category of finite orbispectra admits a contravariant involution extending Spanier--Whitehead duality. This duality relates homotopical cobordism theories (cohomology theories on finite orbispectra) represented by global Thom spectra to geometric (derived) orbifold bordism groups (homology theories on finite orbispectra). This isomorphism extends the classical Pontryagin--Thom isomorphism and its known equivariant generalizations.
