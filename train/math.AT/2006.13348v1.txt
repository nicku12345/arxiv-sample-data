In this paper, we study genuine equivariant factorization homology and its interaction with equivariant Thom spectra, which we construct using the language of parametrized higher category theory. We describe the genuine equivariant factorization homology of Thom spectra, and use this description to compute several examples of interest. A key ingredient for our computations is an equivariant nonabelian Poincar\'e duality theorem, in which we prove that factorization homology with coefficients in a G-space is given by a mapping space. We compute the Real topological Hochschild homology (THR) of the Real bordism spectrum MU_\mathbb{R} and of the equivariant Eilenberg--MacLane spectra H\underline{\mathbb{F}}_2 and H\underline{\mathbb{Z}}_{(2)}, as well as factorization homology of the sphere S^{2\sigma} with coefficients in these Eilenberg--MacLane spectra. In the appendix, Jeremy Hahn and Dylan Wilson compute THR(H\underline{\mathbb{Z}}).
