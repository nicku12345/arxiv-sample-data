In this paper we introduce homological and homotopical Poincar\'e polynomials P_f(t) and P^{\pi}_f(t) of a continuous map f:X \to Y such that if f:X \to Y is a constant map, or more generally, if Y is contractible, then these Poincar\'e polynomials are respectively equal to the usual homological and homotopical Poincar\'e polynomials P_X(t) and P^{\pi}_X(t) of the source space X. Our relative Hilali conjecture P^{\pi}_f(1) \leqq P_f(1) is a map version of the the well-known Hilali conjecture P^{\pi}_X(1) \leqq P_X(1) of a rationally elliptic space X. In this paper we show that under the condition that H_i(f;\mathbb Q):H_i(X;\mathbb Q) \to H_i(Y;\mathbb Q) is not injective for some i>0, the relative Hilali conjecture of product of maps holds, namely, there exists a positive integer n_0 such that for \forall n \geqq n_0 the \emph{strict inequality P^{\pi}_{f^n}(1) < P_{f^n}(1)} holds, where f^n:X^n \to Y^n. In the final section we pose a question whether a "Hilali"-type inequality HP^{\pi}_X(r_X) \leqq P_X(r_X) holds for a rationally hyperbolic space X, provided the the homotopical Hilbert--Poincare series HP^{\pi}_X(r_X) converges at the radius r_X of convergence.
