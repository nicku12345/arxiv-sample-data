7-dimensional closed and simply-connected manifolds are important objects in the theory of classical algebraic topology and differential topology. The class has been attractive since the discoveries of 7-dimensional exotic homotopy spheres by Milnor and so on. Still recently, new understandings via algebraic topological tools such as characteristic classes and bordism relations have been discovered by Kreck, Wang, and so on.   The author has been interested in understanding the class in geometric and constructive ways. Thus the author constructed explicit {\it fold} maps, which are higher dimensional versions of Morse functions, on some of the manifolds. The studies have been motivated by studies of {\it special generic} maps, higher dimensional versions of Morse functions on homotopy spheres with exactly two singular points, characterizing them topologically except 4-dimensional cases. The class contains canonical projections of unit spheres for example. This class has been found to be interesting, restricting the topologies and the differentiable structures of the manifolds strictly: Saeki, Sakuma, Wrazidlo, and so on, found explicit phenomena. The present paper concerns fold maps on 7-dimensional closed, simply-connected and spin manifolds whose integral cohomology rings are isomorphic to that of {\mathbb{C}P}^2 \times S^3
