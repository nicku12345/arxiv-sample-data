We compute the Lusternik-Schnirelmann category and the topological complexity of no k-equal manifolds M^{(k)}_d(n) for certain values of d, k and n. This includes instances where M^{(k)}_d(n) is known to be rationally non-formal. The key ingredient in our computations is the knowledge of the cohomology ring H^*(M^{(k)}_d(n)) as described by Dobrinskaya and Turchin. A fine tuning comes from the use of obstruction theory techniques.
