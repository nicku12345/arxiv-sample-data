In this thesis, we study the structure of the polyhedral product \mathcal{Z}_{\mathcal{K}}(D^1,S^0) determined by an abstract simplicial complex {\mathcal{K}} and the pair (D^1,S^0). We showed that there is natural embedding of the hypercube graph in \mathcal{Z}_{\mathcal{K}_n}(D^1,S^0) where {\mathcal{K}}_n is the boundary of an n-gon. This also provides a new proof of a known theorem about genus of the hypercube graph. We give a description of the invertible natural transformations of the polyhedral product functor. Then, we study the action of the cyclic group \mathbb{Z}_n on the space \mathcal{Z}_{\mathcal{K}_n}(D^1,S^0). This action determines a \mathbb{Z}[\mathbb{Z}_n]-module structure of the homology group H_*(\mathcal{Z}_{\mathcal{K}_n}(D^1,S^0)). We also study the Leray-Serre spectral sequence associated to the homotopy orbit space E\mathbb{Z}_n\times_{\mathbb{Z}_n} \mathcal{Z}_{\mathcal{K}_n}(D^1,S^0).
