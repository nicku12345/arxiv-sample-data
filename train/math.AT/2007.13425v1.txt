Digraphs are generalizations of graphs in which each edge is assigned with a direction or two directions. In this paper, we define discrete Morse functions on digraphs, and prove that the homology of the Morse complex and the path homology are isomorphic for a transitive digraph. We also study the collapses defined by discrete gradient vector fields. Let G be a digraph and f a discrete Morse function. Assume the out-degree and in-degree of any zero-point of f on G are both 1. We prove that the original digraph G and its \mathcal{M}-collapse \tilde{G} have the same path homology groups.
