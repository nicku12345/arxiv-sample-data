In this paper, we introduce the notion of G_\infty-ring spectra. These are globally equivariant homotopy types with a structured multiplication, giving rise to power operations on their equivariant homotopy and cohomology groups. We illustrate this structure by analysing when a Moore spectrum can be endowed with a G_\infty-ring structure. Such G_\infty-structures correspond to power operations on the underlying ring, indexed by the Burnside ring. We exhibit a close relation between these globally equivariant power operations and the structure of a \beta-ring, thus providing a new perspective on the theory of \beta-rings.
