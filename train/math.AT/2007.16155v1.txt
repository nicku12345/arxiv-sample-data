Continuing work begin in arXiv:1910.12609, we interpret the Hurewicz homomorphism for Baker and Richter's noncommutative complex cobordism spectrum M\xi in terms of characteristic numbers (indexed by quasi-symmetric functions) for complex-oriented quasitoric manifolds, and show that automorphisms or cohomology operations on this representation are defined by a `renormalization' Hopf algebra of formal diffeomorphisms at the origin of the noncommutative line, previously considered (over Q) in quantum electrodynamics. The resulting structure can be presented in purely algebraic terms, as a groupoid scheme over Z defined by a coaction of this Hopf algebra on the ring of noncommutative symmetric functions. We sketch some applications to symplectic toric manifolds, combinatorics of simplicial spheres, and statistical mechanics.
