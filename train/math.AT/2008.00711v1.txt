We develop a theory of persistent homology for directed simplicial complexes which detects persistent directed cycles in odd dimensions. In order to do so, we introduce a homology theory with coefficients in a semiring: by explicitly removing additive inverses, we are able to detect directed cycles algebraically. We relate directed persistent homology to classical persistent homology, prove some stability results, and discuss the computational aspects of our approach.
