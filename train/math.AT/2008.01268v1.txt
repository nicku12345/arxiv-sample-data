We compare two notions of G-fiber bundles and G-principal bundles in the literature, with an aim to clarify early results in equivariant bundle theory that are needed in current work of equivariant algebraic topology. We also give proofs of some equivariant generalizations of well-known non-equivariant results involving the classifying space.
