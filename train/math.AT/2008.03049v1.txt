In this article, the author improves Baues's homotopy classification of maps between indecomposable (n-1)-connected (n+2) dimensional finite CW-complexes X,Y,n>3, by finding a generating set for any abelian group [X,Y]. Using these generators, the author firstly finds splitting cofiber sequences which imply Zhu-Pan's decomposability result of smash products of the complexes, and secondly, obtains partial results on the groups of homotopy classes of self-homotopy equivalences of the complexes and some of their natural subgroups.
