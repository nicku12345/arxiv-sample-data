We provide a new method to compute the (homotopy) fixed-points of the permutation action on H\mathbb{F}_2 \wedge H\mathbb{F}_2 by relating it to Real bordism. More precisely, we identify the C_4-pullback of the C_2-spectrum N_e^{C_2}H\mathbb{F}_2 with a localization of N_{C_2}^{C_4}MU_{\mathbb{R}}. This allows us to use the localized slice spectral sequence for the computation of \pi_{\bigstar}^{C_2}N_e^{C_2}H\mathbb{F}_2. From this, we compute the first eight homotopy groups and deduce an infinite family of differentials in the homotopy fixed point spectral sequence.
