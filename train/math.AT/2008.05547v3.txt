We consider a nontrivial action of \mathrm{C}_2 on the type 1 spectrum \mathcal{Y} := \mathrm{M}_2(1) \wedge \mathrm{C}(\eta), which is well-known for admitting a 1-periodic v_1-self-map. The resultant finite \mathrm{C}_2-equivariant spectrum \mathcal{Y}^{\mathrm{C}_2} can also be viewed as the complex points of a finite \mathbb{R}-motivic spectrum \mathcal{Y}^\mathbb{R}. In this paper, we show that one of the 1-periodic v_1-self-maps of \mathcal{Y} can be lifted to a self-map of \mathcal{Y}^{\mathrm{C}_2} as well as \mathcal{Y}^{\mathbb{R}}. Further, the cofiber of the self-map of \mathcal{Y}^{\mathbb{R}} is a realization of the subalgebra \mathcal{A}^\mathbb{R}(1) of the \mathbb{R}-motivic Steenrod algebra. We also show that the \mathrm{C}_2-equivariant self-map is nilpotent on the geometric fixed-points of \mathcal{Y}^{\mathrm{C}_2}.
