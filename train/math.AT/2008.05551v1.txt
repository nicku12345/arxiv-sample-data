We develop a mechanism of "isotropy separation for compact objects" that explicitly describes an invertible G-spectrum through its collection of geometric fixed points and gluing data located in certain variants of the stable module category. As an application, we carry out a complete analysis of invertible G-spectra in the case G=A_5. A further application is given by showing that the Picard groups of \mathrm{Sp}^G and a category of derived Mackey functors agree.
