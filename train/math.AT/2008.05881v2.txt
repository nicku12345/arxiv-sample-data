Greenlees has conjectured that the rational stable equivariant homotopy category of a compact Lie group always has an algebraic model. Based on this idea, we show that the category of rational local systems on a connected finite loop space always has a simple algebraic model. When the loop space arises from a connected compact Lie group, this recovers a special case of a result of Pol and Williamson about rational cofree G-spectra. More generally, we show that if K is a closed subgroup of a compact Lie group G such that the Weyl group W_GK is connected, then a certain category of rational G-spectra `at K' has an algebraic model. For example, when K is the trivial group, this is just the category of rational cofree G-spectra, and this recovers the aforementioned result. Throughout, we pay careful attention to the role of torsion and complete categories.
