In this paper, we use the minimal categorical background and maximal concreteness to study equivariant factorization homology in the V-framed case. We work with a finite group G and an n-dimensional orthogonal G-representation V. We set up a monadic bar construction for the equivariant factorization homology for a V-framed manifold with coefficients in \mathrm{E}_V-algebra. We then prove the nonabelian Poincar\'e duality theorem using a geometrically-seen scanning map.
