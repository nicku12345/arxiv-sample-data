Given a compact Lie group G and a commutative orthogonal ring spectrum R such that R[G]_* = \pi_*(R \wedge G_+) is finitely generated and projective over \pi_*(R), we construct a multiplicative G-Tate spectral sequence for each R-module X in orthogonal G-spectra, with E^2-page given by the Hopf algebra Tate cohomology of R[G]_* with coefficients in \pi_*(X). Under mild hypotheses, such as X being bounded below and the derived page RE^\infty vanishing, this spectral sequence converges strongly to the homotopy \pi_*(X^{tG}) of the G-Tate construction X^{tG} = [\widetilde{EG} \wedge F(EG_+, X)]^G.
