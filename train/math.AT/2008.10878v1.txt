Let e: N^n \rightarrow M^m  be an embedding into a compact manifold M. We study the relationship between the homology of the free loop space LM on M and of the space L_NM of loops of M based in N and define a shriek map  e_{!}: H_*( LM, \mathbb{Q}) \rightarrow H_*( L_NM, \mathbb{Q}) using Hochschild cohomology and study its properties. We also extend a result of F\'elix on the injectivity of the induced map  \mathrm{aut}_1M \rightarrow \mathrm{map}(N, M; f )  on rational homotopy groups when M and N have the same dimension and  f: N\rightarrow M  is a map of non zero degree.
