The problem of the description of the orbit space X_{n} = G_{n,2}/T^n for the standard action of the torus T^n on a complex Grassmann manifold G_{n,2} is widely known and it appears in diversity of mathematical questions. A point x\in X_{n} is said to be a critical point if the stabilizer of its corresponding orbit is nontrivial. In this paper, the notion of singular points of X_n is introduced which opened the new approach to this problem. It is showed that for n>4 the set of critical points \text{Crit}X_n belongs to our set of singular points \text{Sing}X_{n}, while the case n=4 is somewhat special for which \text{Sing}X_4\subset \text{Crit}X_4, but there are critical points which are not singular.   The central result of this paper is the construction of the smooth manifold U_n with corners, \dim U_n = \dim X_n and an explicit description of the projection p_{n} : U_{n}\to X_{n} which in the defined sense resolve all singular points of the space X_n. Thus, we obtain the description of the orbit space G_{n,2}/T^n combinatorial structure. Moreover, the T^n-action on G_{n,2} is a seminal example of complexity (n-3) - action. Our results demonstrate the method for general description of orbit spaces for torus actions of positive complexity.
