This paper is a continuation of Alternative to Morse-Novikov Theory for a closed 1-form(I), where the configurations \delta^\omega and \gamma^\omega were defined, and establishes:   -- a refinement of Poincar\'e duality to an equality between the configurations ^{BM} \delta^\omega and \delta^\omega resp. ^{BM} \gamma^\omega and \gamma^\omega in complementary dimensions,   -- the stability property for the configurations \delta^\omega_r,   -- a collection of additional results needed for the proof of Theorems 1.2 and 1.3 in the paper mentioned above.
