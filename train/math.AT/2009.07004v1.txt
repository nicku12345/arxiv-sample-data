Parsummable categories were defined by Schwede as the input for his global algebraic K-theory construction. We prove that their whole homotopy theory with respect to the so-called global equivalences can already be modelled by the more mundane symmetric monoidal categories.   In another direction, we show that the resulting homotopy theory is also equivalent to the homotopy theory of a certain simplicial analogue of parsummable categories, that we call parsummable simplicial sets. These form a bridge to several concepts of `globally coherently commutative monoids' like global \Gamma-spaces and ultracommutative monoids that will be explored in forthcoming work.
