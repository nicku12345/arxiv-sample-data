Let G be a compact connected Lie group and n\geqslant 1 an integer. Consider the space of ordered commuting n-tuples in G, Hom(\mathbb{Z}^n,G), and its quotient under the adjoint action, Rep(\mathbb{Z}^n,G):=Hom(\mathbb{Z}^n,G)/G. In this article we study and in many cases compute the homotopy groups \pi_2(Hom(\mathbb{Z}^n,G)). For G simply--connected and simple we show that \pi_2(Hom(\mathbb{Z}^2,G))\cong \mathbb{Z} and \pi_2(Rep(\mathbb{Z}^2,G))\cong \mathbb{Z}, and that on these groups the quotient map Hom(\mathbb{Z}^2,G)\to Rep(\mathbb{Z}^2,G) induces multiplication by the Dynkin index of G. More generally we show that if G is simple and Hom(\mathbb{Z}^2,G)_{1}\subseteq Hom(\mathbb{Z}^2,G) is the path--component of the trivial homomorphism, then H_2(Hom(\mathbb{Z}^2,G)_{1};\mathbb{Z}) is an extension of the Schur multiplier of \pi_1(G)^2 by \mathbb{Z}. We apply our computations to prove that if B_{com}G_{1} is the classifying space for commutativity at the identity component, then \pi_4(B_{com}G_{1})\cong \mathbb{Z}\oplus \mathbb{Z}, and we construct examples of non-trivial transitionally commutative structures on the trivial principal G-bundle over the sphere \mathbb{S}^{4}.
