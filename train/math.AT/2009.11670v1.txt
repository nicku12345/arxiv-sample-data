In this short note we present a generating function computing the compactly supported Euler characteristic \chi_c(F(X, n), K^{\boxtimes n}) of the configuration spaces on a topologically stratified space X, with K a constructible complex of sheaves on X, and we obtain as a special case a generating function for the Euler characteristic \chi(F(X, n)). We also recall how to use existing results to turn our computation of the Euler characteristic into a computation of the equivariant Euler characteristic.
