To a compact Lie group G one can associate a space E(2,G) akin to the poset of cosets of abelian subgroups of a discrete group. The space E(2,G) was introduced by Adem, F. Cohen and Torres-Giese, and subsequently studied by Adem and G\'omez, and other authors. In this short note, we prove that G is abelian if and only if \pi_i(E(2,G))=0 for i=1,2,4. This is a Lie group analogue of the fact that the poset of cosets of abelian subgroups of a discrete group is simply--connected if and only if the group is abelian.
