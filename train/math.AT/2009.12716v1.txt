We define, in C_p-equivariant homotopy theory for p>2, a notion of \mu_p-orientation analogous to a C_2-equivariant Real orientation. The definition hinges on a C_p-space \mathbb{CP}^{\infty}_{\mu_p}, which we prove to be homologically even in a sense generalizing recent C_2-equivariant work on conjugation spaces.   We prove that the height p-1 Morava E-theory is \mu_p-oriented and that \mathrm{tmf}(2) is \mu_3-oriented. We explain how a single equivariant map v_1^{\mu_p}:S^{2\rho} \to \Sigma^{\infty} \mathbb{CP}^{\infty}_{\mu_p} completely generates the homotopy of E_{p-1} and \mathrm{tmf}(2), expressing a height-shifting phenomenon pervasive in equivariant chromatic homotopy theory.
