In this paper, we show that for finite CW-complexes X and two-stage space Y (for example n-spheres S^n, homogeneous spaces and F_0-spaces), the rational homotopy type of \map(X, Y) is determined by the cohomology algebra H^*(X; \Q) and the rational homotopy type of Y. From this, we deduce the existence of H-structures on a component of the mapping space \map(X, Y), assuming the cohomology algebras of X and Y are isomorphism. Finally, we will show that \map(X, Y; f)\simeq\map(X, Y; f') if the corresponding \emph{Maurer-Cartan elements} are connected by an algebra automorphism of H^\ast(X, \Q).
