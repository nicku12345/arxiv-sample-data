By analogy with complex K--theory and K--theory with reality, there are theories of unitary functor calculus and unitary functor calculus with reality, both of which are generalisations of Weiss' orthogonal calculus. In this paper we show that unitary functor calculus can be completely recovered from the unitary functor calculus with reality, in analogy to how complex topological K--theory is completely recovered from K--theory with reality via forgetting the C_2--action.
