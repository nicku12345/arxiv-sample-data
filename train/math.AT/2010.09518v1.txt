The primary goal of this paper is to study Spanier-Whitehead duality in the K(n)-local category. One of the key players in the K(n)-local category is the Lubin-Tate spectrum E_n, whose homotopy groups classify deformations of a formal group law of height n, in the implicit characteristic p. It is known that E_n is self-dual up to a shift; however, that does not fully take into account the action of the Morava stabilizer group \mathbb{G}_n, or even its subgroup of automorphisms of the formal group in question. In this paper we find that the \mathbb{G}_n-equivariant dual of E_n is in fact E_n twisted by a sphere with a non-trivial (when n>1) action by \mathbb{G}_n. This sphere is a dualizing module for the group \mathbb{G}_n, and we construct and study such an object I_{\mathcal{G}} for any compact p-adic analytic group \mathcal{G}. If we restrict the action of \mathcal{G} on I_{\mathcal{G}} to certain type of small subgroups, we identify I_{\mathcal{G}} with a specific representation sphere coming from the Lie algebra of \mathcal{G}. This is done by a classification of p-complete sphere spectra with an action by an elementary abelian p-group in terms of characteristic classes, and then a specific comparison of the characteristic classes in question. The setup makes the theory quite accessible for computations, as we demonstrate in the later sections of this paper, determining the K(n)-local Spanier-Whitehead duals of E_n^{hH} for select choices of p and n and finite subgroups H of \mathbb{G}_n.
