This work was intended as an attempt to investigate a model of irreversible process and natural phenomena. For this, we introduce the notion of irreversible path (that for brevity we write ir-path), ir-homotopy, ir-contractible space, and Lusternik-Schnirelmann ir-category by equipping the I=[0,1] with left order topology. We will restrict the irreversibility of definitions to T_0 Spaces, such that for T_1 spaces, the ir-paths are constant. After providing some theorems and properties of these notions, eventually, we prove that Lusternik-Schnirelmann ir-category is an invariant of ir-homotopy equivalence.
