Don Davis introduced projective product spaces in 2010 as a generalization of real projective spaces and discussed some of their topological properties. On the other hand, Dold manifolds were introduced by A. Dold long back in 1956 to study the generators of the non-oriented cobordism ring. Recently, in 2019, Nath and Sankaran made a modest generalization of Dold manifolds. In this paper, we generalize the notion of projective product spaces and Dold manifolds which gives infinitely many different classes of new smooth manifolds. Our main goal here is to study integral homology groups, cohomology ring structures, stable tangent bundles and vector field problems on certain generalized projective product spaces and Dold manifolds.
