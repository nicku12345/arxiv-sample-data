We consider orbit configuration spaces C_n^G(S), where S is a surface obtained out of a closed orientable surface \bar{S} by removing a finite number of points (eventually none) and G is a finite group acting freely continuously on S. We prove that the fibration \pi_{n,k} : C_{n}^G(S) \to C_k^G(S) obtained by projecting on the first k coordinates is a rational fibration. As a consequence, the space C_{n}^G(S) has a Sullivan model A_{n,k}=\Lambda V_{C_k^G(S)}\otimes \Lambda V_{C_{n-k}^G(S_{G,k})} fitting in a cdga sequence: \Lambda V_{C_k^G(S)}\to A_{n,k} \to \Lambda V_{C_{n-k}^G(S_{G,k})}, where \Lambda V_X denotes the minimal model of X, and C_{n-k}^G(S_{G,k}) is the fiber of \pi_{n,k}. We show that this model is minimal except for some cases when S\simeq S^2 and compute in all the cases the higher \psi-homotopy groups (related to the generators of the minimal model) of C_n^G(S). We deduce from the computation that C_n^G(S) having finite Betti numbers is a rational K(\pi,1), i.e its minimal model and 1-minimal model are the same (or equivalently the \psi-homotopy space vanishes in degree grater then 2), if and only if S is not homeomorphic to S^2. In particular, for S not homeomorphic to S^2, the minimal model (isomorphic to the 1-minimal model) is entirely determined by the Malcev Lie algebra of \pi_1 C_n^G(S). When A_{n,k} is minimal, we get an exact sequence of Malcev Lie algebras 0\to L_{C_{n-k}^G(S_{G,k})}\to L_{C_{n}^G(S)}\to L_{C_k^G(S)}\to 0, where L_X is the Malcev Lie algebra of \pi_1X. For S \varsubsetneq \bar{S}=S^2 and G acting by orientation preserving homeomorphism, we prove that the cohomology ring of C_n^G(S) is Koszul, and that for some of these spaces the minimal model can be obtained out of a Cartan-Chevally-Eilenberg construction applied to graded Lie algebra computed in an earlier work.
