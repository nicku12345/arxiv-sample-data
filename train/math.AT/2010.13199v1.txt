In topological data analysis persistence modules are used to distinguish the legitimate topological features of a finite data set from noise. Interleavings between persistence modules feature prominantly in the analysis. One can show that for \epsilon positive, the collection of \epsilon-interleavings between two persistence modules M and N has the structure of an affine variety, Thus, the smallest value of \epsilon corresponding to a nonempty variety is the interleaving distance. With this in mind, it is natural to wonder how this variety changes with the value of \epsilon, and what information about M and N can be seen from just the knowledge of their varieties.   In this paper, we focus on the special case where M and N are interval modules. In this situation we classify all possible progressions of varieties, and determine what information about M and N is present in the progression.
