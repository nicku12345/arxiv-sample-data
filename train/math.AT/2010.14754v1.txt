We make a conjecture about all the relations in the E_2 page of the May spectral sequence and prove it in a subalgebra which covers a large range of dimensions. We conjecture that the E_2 page is nilpotent free and also prove it in this subalgebra. For further computations we construct maps of spectral sequences which systematically extend one of the techniques used by May and Tangora.
