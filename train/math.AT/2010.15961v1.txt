We describe two ways to define higher order Toda brackets in a pointed simplicial model category \mathcal{D}: one is a recursive definition using model categorical constructions, and the second uses the associated simplicial enrichment. We show that these two definitions agree, by providing a third, diagrammatic, description of the Toda bracket, and explain how it serves as the obstruction to rectifying a certain homotopy-commutative diagram in \mathcal{D}.
