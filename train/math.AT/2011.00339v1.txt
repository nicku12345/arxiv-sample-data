Understanding the structure of indecomposable n-dimensional persistence modules is a difficult problem, yet is foundational for studying multipersistence. To this end, Buchet and Escolar showed that any finitely presented rectangular (n-1)-dimensional persistence module with finite support is a hyperplane restriction of an n-dimensional persistence module. We extend this result to the following: If M is any finitely presented (n-1)-dimensional persistence module with finite support, then there exists an indecomposable n-dimensional persistence module M' such that M is the restriction of M' to a hyperplane. We also show that any finite zigzag persistence module is the restriction of some indecomposable 3-dimensional persistence module to a path.
