The goal of this short paper is to study the convergence of the Taylor tower of the identity functor in the context of operadic algebras in spectra. Specifically, we show that if A is a (-1)-connected \mathcal{O}-algebra with 0-connected \mathsf{TQ}-homology spectrum \mathsf{TQ}(A), then there is a natural weak equivalence P_\infty(id)A\simeq A_\mathsf{TQ}^\wedge between the limit of the Taylor tower of the identity functor evaluated on A and the \mathsf{TQ}-completion of A. Since, in this context, the identity functor is only known to be 0-analytic, this result extends knowledge of the Taylor tower of the identity beyond its "radius of convergence."
