We determine a nice simple formula for the largest Euclidean space for which there is an orientable n-manifold with a nonimmersion detected by Stiefel-Whitney classes. For Spin manifolds, we prove the analogue of the upper bound and establish the complete answer for n<17, 31<n<40, and for n a 2-power. Results similar to many of these were obtained some 50 years ago, but in a much less tractable form.
