We provide various counter-examples to the long-standing so-called "Omnibus Conjecture" in Rational Homotopy Theory. That is, we show that a space with finite dimensional even-degree rational cohomology and finite dimensional spherical rational homology may indeed have infinite dimensional rational cohomology.   Moreover, we also discuss "dual" versions and special cases of the conjecture.
