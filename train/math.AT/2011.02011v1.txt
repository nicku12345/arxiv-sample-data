In their work on the period map and the dualizing sheaf for Lubin-Tate space, Gross and the second author wrote down an equivalence between the Spanier-Whitehead and Brown-Comenetz duals of certain type n-complexes in the K(n)-local category at large primes. In the culture of the time, these results were accessible to educated readers, but this seems no longer to be the case; therefore, in this note we give the details. Because we are at large primes, the key result is algebraic: in the Picard group of Lubin-Tate space, two important invertible sheaves become isomorphic modulo p.
