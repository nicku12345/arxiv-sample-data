Hyperoctahedral homology is the homology theory associated to the hyperoctahedral crossed simplicial group. It is defined for involutive algebras over a commutative ring using functor homology and the hyperoctahedral bar construction of Fiedorowicz. The main result of the paper proves that hyperoctahedral homology is related to equivariant stable homotopy theory: for a discrete group of odd order, the hyperoctahedral homology of the group algebra is isomorphic to the homology of the fixed points under the involution of an equivariant infinite loop space built from the classifying space of the group.
