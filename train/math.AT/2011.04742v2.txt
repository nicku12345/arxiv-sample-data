For a graph \Gamma, let K(H_{\Gamma},1) denote the Eilenberg-Mac Lane space associated to the right-angled Artin (RAA) group H_{\Gamma} defined by \Gamma. We use the relationship between the combinatorics of \Gamma and the topological complexity of K(H_{\Gamma},1) to explain, and generalize to the higher TC realm, Dranishnikov's observation that the topological complexity of a covering space can be larger than that of the base space. In the process, for any positive integer n, we construct a graph \mathcal{O}_n whose TC-generating function has polynomial numerator of degree n. Additionally, motivated by the fact that K(H_{\Gamma},1) can be realized as a polyhedral product, we study the LS category and topological complexity of more general polyhedral product spaces. In particular, we use the concept of a strong axial map in order to give an estimate, sharp in a number of cases, of the topological complexity of a polyhedral product whose factors are real projective spaces. Our estimate exhibits a mixed cat-TC phenomenon not present in the case of RAA groups.
