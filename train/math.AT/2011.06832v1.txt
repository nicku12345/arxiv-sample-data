Given a dimension function \omega, we define a notion of an \omega-vector weighted digraph and an \omega-equivalence between them. Then we establish a bijection between the weakly (\mathbb{Z}/2)^n-equivariant homeomorphism classes of small covers over \Delta^{n_1}\times\cdots \times \Delta^{n_k} and the set of \omega-equivalence classes of \omega-vector weighted digraphs with k-labeled vertices. As an example, we obtain a formula for the number of weakly (\mathbb{Z}/2)^n-equivariant homeomorphism classes of small covers over a product of three simplices.
