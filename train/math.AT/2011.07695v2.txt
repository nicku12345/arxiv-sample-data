In this paper, we present a closed formula for the cohomology of real Grassmannians. To achieve this, we use a theory of stratified spaces to compute the differentials in a chain complex that computes the cohomology. Specifically, we organize Schubert cells as a conically smooth stratified space in the sense of Ayala, Francis, Tanaka; the links therein yield the sought differentials, using methods in differential topology. Further, we identify the isomorphism type of this chain complex and we use this result to provide a closed formula for the additive structure of the cohomology of real Grassmannians with arbitrary coefficients.
