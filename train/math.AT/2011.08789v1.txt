We reconceptualize the process of forming n-excisive approximations to \infty-categories, in the sense of Heuts, as inverting the suspension functor lifted to A_n-cogroup objects. We characterize n-excisive \infty-categories as those \infty-categories in which A_n-cogroup objects admit desuspensions. Applying this result to pointed spaces we reprove a theorem of Klein-Schw\"anzl-Vogt: every 2-connected cogroup-like A_\infty-space admits a desuspension.
