We determine the image of the 2-primary tmf-Hurewicz homomorphism, where tmf is the spectrum of topological modular forms. We do this by lifting elements of tmf_* to the homotopy groups of the generalized Moore spectrum M(8,v_1^8) using a modified form of the Adams spectral sequence and the tmf-resolution, and then proving the existence of a v_2^32-self map on M(8,v_1^8) to generate 192-periodic families in the stable homotopy groups of spheres.
