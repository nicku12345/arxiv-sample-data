In this paper, for a finite group, we discuss a method for calculating equivariant homology with constant coefficients. We apply it to completely calculate the geometric fixed points of the equivariant spectrum representing equivariant (co)homology with constant coefficients. We also treat a more complicated example of inverting the standard representation in the equivariant homology of split extraspecial groups at the prime 2.
