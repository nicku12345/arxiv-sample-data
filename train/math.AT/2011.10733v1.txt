Homotopic distance \D as introduced in \cite{MVML} can be realized as a pseudometric on \mathrm{Map}(X,Y). In this paper, we study the topology induced by the pseudometric \D. In particular, we consider the space \mathrm{Map}(S^1,S^1) and show that homotopic distance between any two maps in this space is 1. Moreover, while a general proof of the non-compactness of the space \mathrm{Map}(X,Y) is still an open problem, it can be shown that \mathrm{Map}(S^1,S^1) is not compact.
