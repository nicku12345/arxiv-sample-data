We introduce a notion of unstable algebra over an operad. We show that the unstable algebra freely generated by an unstable module is itself a free algebra under suitable conditions. This arises as a particular case of a result on graded algebras endowed with a Frobenius map. We use our result to obtain a new construction of the unstable modules studied by Carlsson and Brown-Gitler which takes into account their internal product. Finally, we generalise results due to Campbell-Selick and Duflot-Kuhn-Winstead, which deal with twisted actions on unstable algebras.
