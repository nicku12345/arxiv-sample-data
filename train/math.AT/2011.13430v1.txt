This paper displays the Healy-McInnes UMAP construction V(X,N) as an iterated pushout of Vietoris-Rips objects associated to extended pseudo metric spaces (ep-metric spaces) defined by choices of neighbourhoods of the elements of a finite set X. An inclusion X \subset Y in another finite set defines a map of UMAP systems V(X,N) \to V(Y,N') in the presence of a compatible system of neighbourhoods N' for Y. There is also an induced map of ep-metric spaces (X,D) \to (Y,D'), where D and D' are colimits (global averages) of the metrics defined by the neighbourhood systems for X and Y. We prove a stablity result for the restriction of this ep-metric space map to global components. This stability result translates, via excision for path components, to a stability result for global components of the UMAP systems.
