We prove equality of analytic and topological L^2-torsion associated with an odd-dimensional finite volume hyperbolic manifold and a representation of the fundamental group which extends to the ambient Lie group. This generalizes a previous result due to L\"uck and Schick. Alternatively, this result can be regarded as the L^2-analogue of recent work by M\"uller and Rochon.
