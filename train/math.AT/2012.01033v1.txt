We present an algorithm to decompose filtered chain complexes into sums of interval spheres. The algorithm's correctness is proved through principled methods from homotopy theory. Its asymptotic runtime complexity is shown to be cubic in the number of generators, e.g. the simplices of a simplicial complex, as it is based on the row reduction of the boundary matrix by Gaussian elimination. Applying homology to a filtered chain complex, one obtains a persistence module. So our method also provides a new algorithm for the barcode decomposition of persistence modules. The key differences with respect to the state-of-the-art persistent homology algorithms are that our algorithm uses row rather than column reductions, it intrinsically adopts both the clear and compress optimisation strategies, and, finally, it can process rows according to any random order.
