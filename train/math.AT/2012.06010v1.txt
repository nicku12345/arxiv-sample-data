Recently, neural network architectures have been developed to accommodate when the data has the structure of a graph or, more generally, a hypergraph. While useful, graph structures can be potentially limiting. Hypergraph structures in general do not account for higher order relations between their hyperedges. Simplicial complexes offer a middle ground, with a rich theory to draw on. We develop a convolutional neural network layer on simplicial 2-complexes.
