Let p denote an odd prime. We show by example that the inequalities obtained in arXiv:1704.05827 for the behaviour of the cohomological index of a join of free \Z/p-actions are sharp. Namely, for all odd integers k,l at least one of which is greater than one, we give examples of finite free \Z/p-CW complexes of cohomological indices k and l whose join has index k+l+1 and also examples where the join has index k+l-1.
