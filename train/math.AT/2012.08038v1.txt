The paper is devoted to a generalized and simplified version of author's approach to covering theorems in bounded cohomology theory. The amenability assumptions are replaced by weaker and more natural acyclicity assumprions. In the case of open coverings the paracompactness assumption is removed. It is shown that for paracompact spaces the case of closed coverings can be reduced to the case of open coverings if spaces and subspaces in question behave nicely with respect to fundamental groups and covering spaces. Another covering theorem for closed coverings assumes nice behavior with respect to singular homology; now only its proof uses the sheaf theory. The methods apply also to l_1-homology. The exposition is largely self-contained. In particular, the required results from the theory of paracompact spaces are presented with full proofs.
