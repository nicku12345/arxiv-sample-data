The paper is devoted to an adaptation of author's approach to Leray theorems in bounded cohomology theory to infinite chains. The main results are a stronger and more general form of Gromov's Vanishing-finiteness theorem and a generalization of the first part of his Cutting-of theorem. The proofs are elementary.
