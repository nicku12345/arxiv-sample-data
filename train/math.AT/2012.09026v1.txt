By analogy with methods of Spivak, there is a realization functor which takes a persistence diagram Y in simplicial sets to an extended pseudo-metric space (or ep-metric space) Re(Y). The functor Re has a right adjoint, called the singular functor, which takes an ep-metric space Z to a persistence diagram S(Z). We give an explicit description of Re(Y), and show that it depends only on the 1-skeleton sk_{1}Y of Y. If X is a totally ordered ep-metric space, then there is an isomorphism Re(V_{\ast}(X)) \cong X, between the realization of the Vietoris-Rips diagram V_{\ast}(X) and the ep-metric space X. The persistence diagrams V_{\ast}(X) and S(X) are sectionwise equivalent for all such X.
