The completion tower of a nonunital commutative ring is a classical construction in commutative algebra. In the setting of structured ring spectra as modeled by algebras over a spectral operad, the analogous construction is the homotopy completion tower. The purpose of this brief note is to show that localization with respect to the Johnson-Wilson spectrum E(n) commutes with the terms of this tower.
