In this article, we prove that Buchstaber invariant of 4-dimensional real universal complex is no less than 24 as a follow-up to the work of Ayzenberg [2] and Sun [14]. Moreover, a lower bound for Buchstaber invariants of n-dimensional real universal complexes is given as an improvement of Erokhovet's result in [7].
