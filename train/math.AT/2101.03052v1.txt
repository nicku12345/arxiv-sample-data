In this article a recognition principle for \infty-loop pairs of spaces of connective commutative algebra spectra over connective commutative ring spectra is proved. This is done by generalizing the classical recognition principle for connective commutative ring spectra using relative operads. The machinery of idempotent quasiadjunctions is used to handle the model theoretical aspects of the proof.
