We show that S^n \vee S^m is \mathbb{Z}/p^r-hyperbolic for all primes p and all r \in \mathbb{N}, provided n,m \geq 2, and consequently that various spaces containing S^n \vee S^m as a p-local retract are \mathbb{Z}/p^r-hyperbolic. We then give a K-theory criterion for a suspension \Sigma X to be p-hyperbolic, and use it to deduce that the suspension of a complex Grassmannian \Sigma Gr_{k,n} is p-hyperbolic for all odd primes p when n \geq 3 and 0<k<n. We obtain similar results for some related spaces.
