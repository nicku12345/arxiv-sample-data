In this article we study thick ideals defined by periodic self maps in the stable motivic homotopy category over \mathbb{C}. In addition, we extend some results of Ruth Joachimi about the relation between thick ideals defined by motivic Morava K-theories and the preimages of the thick ideals in the stable homotopy category under Betti realization.
