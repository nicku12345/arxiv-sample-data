For a finite group G, G-transfer systems are combinatorial objects which encode the homotopy category of G-N_\infty operads, whose algebras in G-spectra are E_\infty G-spectra with a specified collection of multiplicative norms. For G finite Abelian, we demonstrate a correspondence between G-transfer systems and weak factorization systems on the poset category of subgroups of G. This induces a self-duality on the lattice of G-transfer systems.
