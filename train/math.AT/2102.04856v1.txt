The Alexandroff-\v{C}ech normal cohomology theory [Mor_1], [Bar], [Ba_1],[Ba_2] is the unique continuous extension \cite{Wat} of the additive cohomology theory [Mil], [Ber-Mdz_1] from the category of polyhedral pairs \mathcal{K}^2_{Pol} to the category of closed normally embedded, the so called, P-pairs of general topological spaces \mathcal{K}^2_{Top}. In this paper we define the Alexander-Spanier normal cohomology theory based on all normal coverings and show that it is isomorphic to the Alexandroff-\v{C}ech normal cohomology. Using this fact and methods developed in [Ber-Mdz_3] we construct an exact, the so called, Alexander-Spanier normal homology theory on the category \mathcal{K}^2_{Top}, which is isomorphic to the Steenrod homology theory on the subcategory of compact pairs \mathcal{K}^2_{C}. Moreover, we give an axiomatic characterization of the constructed homology theory.
