The goal of this article is to extend a theorem of Lurie \[   \mathsf{Sh}_A (X) = \mathsf{Fun}(\mathsf{Exit}_A (X), \mathsf{S}) \] representing constructible sheaves with values in  \mathsf{S} , the  \infty -category of spaces, on a stratified space  X  with poset of strata  A , as functors from the exit paths  \infty -category  \mathsf{Exit}_A (X)  to  \mathsf{S} . Lurie's representation theorem works provided  A  satisfy the ascending chain condition. This typically rules out infinite dimensional examples of stratified space.   Building on it and with the help of a stratified homotopy invariance theorem from Haine, we show that when  X  is a nice enough  A -stratified space and when  A  is itself stratified  A_{\leq 0} \subset A_{\leq 1} \subset \cdots \subset A  by posets satisfying the ascending chain condition, \[   \mathsf{Hyp}_A (X) = \mathsf{Fun}(\mathsf{Exit}_A(X), \mathsf{S}) \] the  \infty -category of  A -constructible hypersheaves on  X  is represented by functors from the exit paths  \infty -category of  X .   There are two types of nice stratified spaces on which this extended representation theorem applies: conically stratified spaces and spaces that are sequential colimits of conically stratified spaces. Examples of application include the metric and the topological exponentials of a Fr\'echet manifold, locally countable simplicial complexes and more generally, locally countable cylindrically normal CW-complexes.
