In this study, we improve the topological complexity computations on digital images with introducing the digital topological complexity computations of a surjective and digitally continuous map between digital images. We also reveal differences in topological complexity computations of maps between digital images and topological spaces. Moreover, we emphasize the importance of the adjacency relation on the domain and the range of a digital map in these computations.
