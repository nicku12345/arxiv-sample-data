In his seminal work on localisation of spectra, Ravenel initiated the study of Bousfield classes of spectra related to the chromatic perspective. In particular he showed that there were infinitely many distinct Bousfield classes between \langle MU\rangle and \langle S^0\rangle. The main topological goal of this paper is investigate how these Bousfield classes are related to that of another classical Thom spectrum MSp, and in particular how \langle MSp\rangle is related to \langle MU\rangle.   We follow the approach of Ravenel, but adapt it using the theory of P-algebras to give vanishing results for cohomology. Our work involves dualising and considering comodules over duals of P-algebras; these ideas are then applied to the mod~2 Steenrod algebra and certain subHopf algebras.
