Using the cohomology of the G_2-flag manifolds G_2/U(2)_{\pm}, and their structure as a fiber bundle over the homogeneous space G_2/SO(4) with fiber S^2, we compute their Borel cohomology, and the Fadell-Husseini index of such bundles, for the \mathbb{Z}_2-action given by complex conjugation of complex structures on associative 3-planes.   Considering the orthogonal complement of the tautological bundle over \widetilde{G}_{3}(\mathbb{R}7), we compute the \mathbb{Z}_2 Fadell-Husseini index of the pullback bundle induced by the embedding i: G_2/SO(4) \to \widetilde{G}_{3}(\mathbb{R}7). We derive a general formula for the pullback, along the inclusion i, of an iterated external product bundle over a product of Grassmann manifolds.
