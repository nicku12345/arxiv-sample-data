For the projective unitary group PU_n with a maximal torus T_{PU_n} and Weyl group W, we show that the integral restriction homomorphism \[\rho_{PU_n} \colon H^*(BPU_n;\mathbb{Z})\rightarrow H^*(BT_{PU_n};\mathbb{Z})^W\] to the integral invariants of the Wely group action is onto. We also present several rings naturally isomorphic to H^*(BT_{PU_n};\mathbb{Z})^W.   In addition we give general sufficient conditions for the restriction homomorphism \rho_G to be onto for a connected compact Lie group G.
