Let P_{k}=H^{*}((\mathbb{R}P^{\infty})^{k}) be the modulo-2 cohomology algebra of the direct product of k copies of infinite dimensional real projective spaces \mathbb{R}P^{\infty}. Then, P_{k} is isomorphic to the graded polynomial algebra \mathbb{F}_{2}[x_{1},\ldots,x_{k}] of k variables, in which each x_{j} is of degree 1, and let GL_k be the general linear group over the prime field \mathbb{F}_2 which acts naturally on P_k. Here the cohomology is taken with coefficients in the prime field \mathbb F_2 of two elements. We study the {\it hit problem}, set up by Frank Peterson, of finding a minimal set of generators for the polynomial algebra P_k as a module over the mod-2 Steenrod algebra, \mathcal{A}.   In this Note, we explicitly compute the hit problem for k = 5 and the degree 5(2^s-1)+24.2^s with s an arbitrary non-negative integer. These results are used to study the Singer algebraic transfer which is a homomorphism from the homology of the mod-2 Steenrod algebra, \mbox{Tor}^{\mathcal{A}}_{k, k+n}(\mathbb{F}_2, \mathbb{F}_2), to the subspace of \mathbb{F}_2\otimes_{\mathcal{A}}P_k consisting of all the GL_k-invariant classes of degree n. We show that Singer's conjecture for the algebraic transfer is true in the case k=5 and the above degrees. This method is different from that of Singer in studying the image of the algebraic transfer. Moreover, as a consequence, we get the dimension results for polynomial algebra in some generic degrees in the case k=6.
