Hopkins and Mahowald gave a simple description of the mod p Eilenberg Mac Lane spectrum \mathrm{H}{\mathbb{F}}_p as the free \mathbb{E}_2-algebra with an equivalence of p and 0. We show for each faithful 2-dimensional representation \lambda of a p-group G that the G-equivariant Eilenberg Mac Lane spectrum \mathrm{H}\underline{\mathbb{F}}_p is the free \mathbb{E}_{\lambda}-algebra with an equivalence of p and 0. This unifies and simplifies recent work of Behrens, Hahn, and Wilson, and extends it to include the dihedral 2-subgroups of O(2). The main new idea is that \mathrm{H}\underline{\mathbb{F}}_p has a simple description as a p-cyclonic module over \rm{THH}(\rm{H}\mathbb{F}_p). We show our result is the best possible one in that it gives all groups G and representations V such that \rm{H}\underline{\mathbb{F}}_p is the free \mathbb{E}_V-algebra with an equivalence of p and 0.
