Given X a finite nilpotent simplicial set, consider the classifying fibrations  X\to Baut_G^*(X)\to Baut_G(X),\qquad X\to Z\to Baut_{\pi}^*(X),    where G and \pi denote, respectively, subgroups of the free and pointed homotopy classes of free and pointed self homotopy equivalences of X which act nilpotently on H_*(X) and \pi_*(X).   We give algebraic models, in terms of complete differential graded Lie algebras (cdgl's), of the rational homotopy type of these fibrations. Explicitly, if L is a cdgl model of X, there are connected sub cdgl's Der^G L and Der^{\pi} L of the Lie algebra Der L of derivations of L such that the geometrical realization of the sequences of cdgl morphisms      L\stackrel{ad}{\to} Der^G L\to Der^G L\widetilde\times sL,\qquad L\to L\widetilde\times Der^{\pi} L\to Der^{\pi} L      have the rational homotopy type of the above classifying fibrations. Among the consequences we also describe in cdgl terms the Malcev Q-completion of G and \pi together with the rational homotopy type of the classifying spaces BG  and B\pi.
