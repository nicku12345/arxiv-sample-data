The geometry of the Lubin-Tate space of deformations of a formal group is studied via an \'etale, rigid analytic map from the deformation space to projective space. This leads to a simple description of the equivariant canonical bundle of the deformation space which, in turn, yields a formula for the dualizing complex in stable homotopy theory.
