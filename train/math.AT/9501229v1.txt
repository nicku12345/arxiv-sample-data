We produce a one-parameter family of hyperplane arrangements that are counterexamples to the conjecture of Saito that the complexified complement of a free arrangement is K(\pi,1). These arrangements are the restriction of a one-parameter family of arrangements that arose in the study of tilings of certain centrally symmetric octagons. This other family is discussed as well.
