The question of whether a given H-space X is, up to homotopy, a loop space has been studied from a variety of viewpoints. Here we address this question from the aspect of homotopy operations, in the classical sense of operations on homotopy groups.   First, we show how an H-space structure on X can be used to define the action of the primary homotopy operations on the shifted homotopy groups \pi_{*-1} X (which are isomorphic to \pi_* Y, if X=\Omega\Y. This action will behave properly with respect to composition of operations if X is homotopy-associative, and will lift to a topological action of the monoid of all maps between spheres if and only if X is a loop space. The obstructions to having such a topological action may be formulated in the framework of an obstruction theory for realizing \Pi-algebras, which is simplified here by showing that any (suitable) \Delta-simplicial space may be made into a full simplicial space (a result which may be useful in other contexts).
