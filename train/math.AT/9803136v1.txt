As is well-known, the Witten deformation of the De Rham complex computes the De Rham cohomology. In this paper we study the Witten deformation on a noncompact manifold and restrict it to differential forms which behave polynomially near infinity. Such polynomial differential forms naturally appear on manifolds with a cylindrical structure. We prove that the cohomology of the Witten deformation acting on the complex of the polynomially growing forms can be computed as the relative cohomology of the manifold with respect to the negative remote fiber of the function. We show that the assumptions of our main theorem are satisfied in a number of interesting special cases, including generic real polynomials.
