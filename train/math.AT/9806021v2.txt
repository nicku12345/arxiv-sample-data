A Lefschetz-type coincidence theorem for two maps f,g:X->Y from an arbitrary topological space X to a manifold Y is given: I(f,g)=L(f,g), the coincidence index is equal to the Lefschetz number. It follows that if L(f,g) is not equal to zero then there is an x in X such that f(x)=g(x). In particular, the theorem contains some well-known coincidence results for (i) X,Y manifolds and (ii) f with acyclic fibers.
