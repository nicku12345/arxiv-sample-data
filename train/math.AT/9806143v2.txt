In the paper we compute the ring strucure on the rational cohomology of a complex subspace complement. For that we construct a small differential graded subalgebra of the De Concini-Procesi wonderful model that is quasi isomorphic to this model. For two classes of arrangements explicit presentation of the ring is given.
