More precisely, let \Delta(K) denote the algebraically shifted complex of simplicial complex K, and let \rbeti{j}(K,L)=\dimk \rhomi{j}(K,L;\kk) be the dimension of the jth reduced relative homology group over a field \kk of a pair of simplicial complexes L \subseteq K. Then \rbeti{j}(K,L) \leq \rbeti{j}(\Delta(K),\Delta(L)) for all j.   The theorem is motivated by somewhat similar results about Gr\"obner bases and generic initial ideals. Parts of the proof use Gr\"obner basis techniques.
