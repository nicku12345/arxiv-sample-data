We consider partial liftings of maps at fibrations and compare the primary obstruction to extend the lifting with the obstruction to extend the lifting as a simple map into the total space. A relation between these two obstructions is proved for the case when the fiber is an Eilenberg-MacLane space. Furthermore it is shown that this result specialises to well known facts about secondary obstructions.
