Let G be a finite group. To every smooth G-action on a compact, connected and oriented Riemann surface we can associate its data of singular orbits. The set of such data becomes an Abelian group B_G under the G-equivariant connected sum. The map which sends G to B_G is functorial and carries many features of the representation theory of finite groups. In this paper we will give a complete computation of the group B_G for any finite group G.   There is a surjection from the G-equivariant cobordism group of surface diffeomorphisms \Omega_G to B_G. We will prove that the kernel of this surjection is isomorphic to H_2(G;Z). Thus \Omega_G is an Abelian group extension of B_G by H_2(G;Z).   Finally we will prove that the group B_G contains only elements of order two if and only if every complex character of G has values in R. This property shows a strong relationship between the functor B and the representation theory of finite groups.
