Theorem (after Giraud, SGA 4): Suppose A is a simplicial category. The following conditions are equivalent: (i) There is a cofibrantly generated closed model category M such that A is equivalent to the Dwyer-Kan simplicial localization L(M); (ii) A admits all small homotopy colimits, and there is a small subset of objects of A which are A-small, and which generate A by homotopy colimits; (iii) There exists a small 1-category C and a morphism g:C\to A sending objects of C to A-small objects, which induces a fully faithful inclusion i:A\to \hat{C}, such that i admits a left homotopy-adjoint \psi.   We call a Segal category A which satisfies these equivalent conditions, an \infty-pretopos. Note that (i) implies that A admits all small homotopy limits too.   If furthermore there exists C\to A as in (iii) such that the adjoint \psi preserves finite homotopy limits, then we say that A is an ``\infty-topos''.
