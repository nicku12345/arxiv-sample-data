Virtual knots arise in the study of Gauss diagrams and Vassiliev invariants of usual knots. Virtual braids correspond naturally to virtual knots. We consider the group of virtual braids on n strings VB_n and its Burau representation, in particular we study their homological properties. We prove that the plus-construction of the classifying space of the virtual braid group on the infinite number of strings is an infinite loop space which is equivalent to a product of Q(S^0), S^1 and an infinite loop space Y. Connections with the K-functor of the integers are discussed.
