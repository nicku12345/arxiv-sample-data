Let G be a finite group, and let E be a generalised cohomology theory, subject to certain technical conditions. We study a certain ring C(E,G) that is the best possible approximation to E^0BG that can be built using only knowledge of the complex representations of G. There is a natural map C(E,G) -> E^0BG, whose image is the subring of E^0BG generated over E^0 by all Chern classes of such representations.   There is ample precedent for considering this subring in the parallel case of ordinary cohomology. However, although the generators of this subring come from representation theory, the same cannot be said for the relations; one purpose of our construction is to remedy this. We also also develop a kind of generalised character theory which gives good information about the rationalisation of C(E,G). In the few cases that we have been able to analyse completely, either C(E,G) is rationally different from E^0BG for easy character-theoretic reasons, or we have C(E,G)=E^0BG.   Rather than working directly with rings, we will study the formal schemes X(G)=spf(E^0BG) and XCh(G)=spf(C(E,G)). Suitably interpreted, our main definition is that XCh(G) is the scheme of homomorphisms from the Lambda-semiring R^+(G) of complex representations of G to the Lambda-semiring scheme of divisors on the formal group associated to E.
