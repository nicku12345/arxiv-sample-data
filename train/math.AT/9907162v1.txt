Let X be a topological space, U -- opened subset of X. We will say that point x \in \partial U is {\it accessible} from U if there exists continuous injective mapping \phi : I \to \Cl D such that \phi(1)=x, \phi([0,1)) \subset \Int U.   We proove the next main theorem. The following conditions are neccesary and suffficient for a compact subset D of R^2 with a nonempty interior \Int D to be homeomorphic to a closed 2-dimensional disk: 1) sets \Int D and R^2 \setminus D are connected; 2) any x \in \partial D is accessible both from \Int D and from R^2 \setminus D.
