In this paper we compute homotopical bordism rings MU^G_* for abelian compact Lie groups G, giving explicit generators and relations. The key constructions are operations on equivariant bordism which should play an important role in equivariant stable homotopy theory more generally. The main technique used is localization of the theory by inverting Euler classes. Applications to homotopy theory include analysis of the completion map from MU^G_* to MU^*(BG). Applications to geometry include classification up to cobordism of S^1 actions on stably complex four-manifolds with precisely three fixed points, answering a question of Bott.
