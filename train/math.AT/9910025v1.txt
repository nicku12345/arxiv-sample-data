In this paper we compute homotopical equivariant bordism for the group {\bf Z/2}, namely MO^{\bf Z/2}, geometric equivariant bordism \Omega^{\bf Z/2}_*, and their quotient as modules over geometric bordism. This quotient is a module of stable transversality obstructions. In doing these computations, we use the techniques the author developed in the complex setting. Because we are working in the real setting only with Z/2, these techniques simplify greatly.
