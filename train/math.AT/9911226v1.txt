We give lowed bounds on the number of periodic trajectories in strictly convex smooth billiards in \R^{m+1} for m\ge 3. For plane billiards (when m=1) such bounds were obtained by G. Birkhoff in the 1920's. Our proof is based on topological methods of calculus of variations - equivariant Morse and Lusternik - Schirelman theories. We compute the equivariant cohomology ring of the cyclic configuration space of the sphere S^m, i.e., the space of n-tuples of points (x_1, ..., x_n), where x_i\in S^m and x_i\ne x_{i+1} for i=1,2, ..., n.
