Let \mu be a Radon measure on R^d, which may be non doubling. The only condition that \mu must satisfy is \mu(B(x,r))\leq C r^n, for all x,r and for some fixed 0<n\leq d. Recently we introduced spaces of type BMO(\mu) and H^1(\mu) which proved to be useful to study the L^p(\mu) boundedness of Calder\'on-Zygmund operators without assuming doubling conditions. In this paper a characterization of the new atomic space H^1(\mu) in terms of a grand maximal operator M_\Phi is given. It is shown that f belongs to H^1(\mu) iff f\in L^1(\mu), \int f d\mu=0 and M_\Phi(f)\in L^1(\mu), as in the usual doubling situation. The lack of any regularity condition on \mu, apart from the size condition stated above, is one of the main difficulties that appears when one tries to extend the classical arguments to the present situation.
