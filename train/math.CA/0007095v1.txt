Let m(a,b) and M(a,b,c) be symmetric means. We say that M is type 1 invariant with respect to m if M(m(a,c),m(a,b),m(b,c)) = M(a,b,c) for all a, b, c > 0. If m is strict and isotone, then we show that there exists a unique M which is type 1 invariant with respect to m. In particular we discuss the invariant logarithmic mean L_3, which is type 1 invariant with respect to L(a,b) = (b-a)/(log b-log a). We say that M is type 2 invariant with respect to m if M(a,b,m(a,b)) = m(a,b) for all a, b > 0. We also prove existence and uniqueness results for type 2 invariance, given the mean M(a,b,c). The arithmetic, geometric, and harmonic means in two and three variables satisfy both type 1 and type 2 invariance. There are means m and M such that M is type 2 invariant with respect to m, but not type 1 invariant with respect to m(for example, the Lehmer means). L_3 is type 1 invariant with respect to L, but not type 2 invariant with respect to L.
