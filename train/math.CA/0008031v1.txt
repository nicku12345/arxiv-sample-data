We prove that if a multiple trigonometric series is spherically Abel summable everywhere to an everywhere finite function f(x) which is bounded below by an integrable function, then the series is the Fourier series of f(x) if the coefficients of the multiple trigonometric series satisfy a mild growth condition. As a consequence, we show that if a multiple trigonometric series is spherically convergent everywhere to an everywhere finite integrable function f(x), then the series is the Fourier series of f(x). We also show that a singleton is a set of uniqueness. These results are generalizations of a recent theorem of J. Bourgain and some results of V. Shapiro.
