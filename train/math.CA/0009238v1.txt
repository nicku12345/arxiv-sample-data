In this paper we investigate the smallest eigenvalue, denoted as \la_N, of a (N+1)\times (N+1) Hankel or moments matrix, associated with the weight, w(x)=\exp(-x^{\bt}),x>0,\bt>0, in the large N limit. Using a previous result, the asymptotics for the polynomials, P_n(z),z\notin[0,\infty), orthonormal with respect to w, which are required in the determination of \la_N are found. Adopting an argument of Szeg\"{o} the asymptotic behaviour of \la_N, for \bt>1/2 where the related moment problem is determinate, is derived. This generalises the result given by Szeg\"{o} for \bt=1. It is shown that for \bt>1/2 the smallest eigenvalue of the infinite Hankel matrix is zero, while for 0<\bt<1/2 it is greater then a positive constant. This shows a phase transition in the corresponding Hermitian random matrix model as the parameter \bt varies with \bt=1/2 identified as the critical point. The smallest eigenvalue at this point is conjectured.
