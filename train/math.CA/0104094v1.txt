Let D be a bounded domain in {\Bbb R}^n whose boundary has a Minkowski dimension \alpha<n. Suppose that E_{\Lambda}= {\{e^{2 \pi i x \cdot \lambda}\}}_{\lambda \in \Lambda}, \Lambda an infinite discrete subset of {\Bbb R}^n, is a frame of exponentials for L^2(D), with frame constants A,B, A \leq B. Then if  R \ge C{(\frac{{B|\partial D|}_{\alpha}}{A|D|} )}^ {\frac{1}{n-\alpha}}, where C depends only on the ambient dimension n and {|\partial D|}_{\alpha} denotes the Minkowski content, then every cube of sidelength R contains at least one element of \Lambda. We give examples that illustrate the extent to which our estimates are sharp.
