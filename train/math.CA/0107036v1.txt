A short introduction to the use of the spectral theorem for self-adjoint operators in the theory of special functions is given. As the first example, the spectral theorem is applied to Jacobi operators, i.e. tridiagonal operators, on l^2(N), leading to a proof of Favard's theorem stating that polynomials satisfying a three-term recurrence relation are orthogonal polynomials. We discuss the link to the moment problem. In the second example, the spectral theorem is applied to Jacobi operators on l^2(Z). We discuss the theorem of Masson and Repka linking the deficiency indices of a Jacobi operator on l^2(Z) to those of two Jacobi operators on l^2(N). For two examples of Jacobi operators on l^2(Z), namely for the Meixner, respectively Meixner-Pollaczek, functions, related to the associated Meixner, respectively Meixner-Pollaczek, polynomials, and for the second order hypergeometric q-difference operator, we calculate the spectral measure explicitly. This gives explicit (generalised) orthogonality relations for hypergeometric and basic hypergeometric series.
