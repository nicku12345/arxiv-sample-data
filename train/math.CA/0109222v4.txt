The 15 Gauss contiguous relations for {}_2F_1 hypergeometric series imply that any three {}_2F_1 series whose corresponding parameters differ by integers are linearly related (over the field of rational functions in the parameters). We prove several properties of coefficients of these general contiguous relations, and use the results to propose effective ways to compute contiguous relations. We also discuss contiguous relations of generalized and basic hypergeometric functions, and several applications of them.
