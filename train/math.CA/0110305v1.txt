Stochastic processes on topological vector spaces over non-Archimedean fields and with transition measures having values in non-Archimedean fields are defined and investigated. For this the non-Archimedean analog of the Kolmogorov theorem is proved. The analogos of Markov and Poisson processes are studied. For Poisson processes the corresponding Poisson measures are considered and the non-Archimedean analog of the L\`evy theorem is proved. Wide classes of stochastic processes are constructed.
