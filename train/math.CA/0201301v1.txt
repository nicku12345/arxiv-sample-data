Let \Omega be a strongly Lipschitz domain of \reel^n. Consider an elliptic second order divergence operator L (including a boundary condition on \partial\Omega) and define a Hardy space by imposing the non-tangential maximal function of the extension of a function f via the Poisson semigroup for L to be inL^1. Under suitable assumptions on L, we identify this maximal Hardy space with atomic Hardy spaces, namely with H^1(\reel^n) if \Omega=\reel^n, H^{1}_{r}(\Omega) under the Dirichlet boundary condition, and H^{1}_{z}(\Omega) under the Neumann boundary condition. In particular, we obtain a new proof of the atomic decomposition for H^{1}_{z}(\Omega). A version for local Hardy spaces is also given. We also present an overview of the theory of Hardy spaces and BMO spaces on Lipschitz domains with proofs.
