Let F be a finite field with characteristic greater than two. Define a \emph{Besicovitch set} in F^4 to be a set P \subseteq F^4 containing a line in every direction. The \emph{Kakeya conjecture} asserts that |P| \approx |F|^4. A result of Wolff establishes that |P| \gtrsim |F|^3. In this paper we improve this to |P| \gtrapprox |F|^{3+\gain}. On the other hand, we show that the bound of |F|^3 is sharp if we relax the assumption that the lines point in different directions. One new feature in the argument is the introduction of a small amount of basic algebraic geometry.
