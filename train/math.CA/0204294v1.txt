Szego's procedure to connect orthogonal polynomials on the unit circle and orthogonal polynomials on [-1,1] is generalized to nonsymmetric measures. It generates the so-called semi-orthogonal functions on the linear space of Laurent polynomials L, and leads to a new orthogonality structure in the module LxL. This structure can be interpreted in terms of a 2x2 matrix measure on [-1,1], and semi-orthogonal functions provide the corresponding sequence of orthogonal matrix polynomials. This gives a connection between orthogonal polynomials on the unit circle and certain classes of matrix orthogonal polynomials on [-1,1]. As an application, the strong asymptotics of these matrix orthogonal polynomials is derived, obtaining an explicit expression for the corresponding Szego's matrix function.
