The zeros of semi-orthogonal functions with respect to a probability measure mu supported on the unit circle can be applied to obtain Szego quadrature formulas. The discrete measures generated by these formulas weakly converge to the orthogonality measure mu. In this paper we construct families of semi-orthogonal functions with interlacing zeros, and give a representation of the support of mu in terms of the asymptotic distribution of such zeros.
