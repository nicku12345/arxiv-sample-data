We consider a problem of bounding the maximal possible multiplicity of a zero at of some expansions \sum a_i F_i(x), at a certain point c, depending on the chosen family \{F_i \}. The most important example is a polynomial with c=1. It is shown that this question naturally leads to discrete orthogonal polynomials. Using this connection we derive some new bounds, in particular on the multiplicity of the zero at one of a polynomial with a prescribed norm.
