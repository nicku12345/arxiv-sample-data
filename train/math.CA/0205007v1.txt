Within the framework of the method of hypersingular integrals we obtain a characterization of the anysotropic spaces L_{\bar p, \bar r}^{\bar \alpha}. These spaces are defined to consist of functions f(x)\in L_{\bar r} for which  F^{-1}(\sum_{j=1}^n |\xi_j|^{\alpha_j})Ff\in L_{\bar p}, \alpha_j>0.  The mentioned characterization is applied to prove the denseness of the class C_0^\infty in L_{\bar p, \bar r}^{\bar \alpha}.
