Taylor expansions of analytic functions are considered with respect to two points. Cauchy-type formulas are given for coefficients and remainders in the expansions, and the regions of convergence are indicated. It is explained how these expansions can be used in deriving uniform asymptotic expansions of integrals. The method is also used for obtaining Laurent expansions in two points.
