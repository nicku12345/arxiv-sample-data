In this paper a general theory of semi-classical matrix orthogonal polynomials is developed. We define the semi-classical linear functionals by means of a distributional equation D(u A) = u B, where A and B are matrix polynomials. Several characterizations for these semi-classical functionals are given in terms of the corresponding (left) matrix orthogonal polynomials sequence. They involve a quasi-orthogonality property for their derivatives, a structure relation and a second order differo-differential equation. Finally we illustrate the preceding results with some non-trivial examples.
