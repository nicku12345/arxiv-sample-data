We consider a basic d-adic model for the scattering transform on the line. We prove L^2 bounds for this scattering transform and a weak L^2 bound for a Carleson type maximal operator. The latter implies boundedness of d-adic models of generalized eigenfunctions of Dirac type operators with potential in L^2(R). We show that this result cannot be obtained by estimating the terms in the natural multilinear expansion of the scattering transform.
