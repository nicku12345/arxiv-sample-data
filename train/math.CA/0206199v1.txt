We construct 3 finite systems of 4-F-3 hypergeometric orthogonal polynomials. The weights are 1) the weight defined by the 5-H-5 Dougall summation formula; 2) the integrand in the Askey beta-integral; 3) the weight w(s)=|p(s)/q(s)|^2, where p(s)=\Gamma(a+is)\Gamma(b+is)\Gamma(c+is) and q(s)=\Gamma(d+is)\Gamma(2is). We also evaluate the integral of the function w(s) using the Jacobi transform (the Olevsky transform); this integral also can be reduced to the Nassrallah--Rahman integral.
