A proof of an unusual summation formula for a basic hypergeometric series associated to the affine root system \tilde A_n that was conjectured by Warnaar is given. It makes use of Milne's A_n extension of Watson's transformation, Ramanujan's _1\psi_1-summation, and a determinant evaluation of the author. In addition, a transformation formula between basic hypergeometric series associated to the affine root systems \tilde A_n respectively \tilde A_m, which generalizes at the same time the above summation formula and an identity due to Gessel and the author, is proposed as a conjecture.
