On the one hand the algebras of linear operators here act on finite-dimensional vector spaces, and on the other hand the point of view is generally an analysts'. Also, one might think of algebras as being used to add more data to basic geometry as on a graph, for instance. Of course this is a common theme which is considered in numerous settings. From an analysts' perspective, compact groups, their representations, and more general topological groups and their representations are basic objects of study. Finite groups are like groups which are especially compact, and with some extra structure. As long as one considers finite groups and finite-dimensional vector spaces, one might as well consider general underlying fields k too. This includes p-adic fields, which are quite interesting for analysis.
