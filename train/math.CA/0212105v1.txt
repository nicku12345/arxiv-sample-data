The Fourier transform is considered as a Henstock--Kurzweil integral. Sufficient conditions are given for the existence of the Fourier transform and necessary and sufficient conditions are given for it to be continuous. The Riemann--Lebesgue lemma fails: Henstock--Kurzweil Fourier transforms can have arbitrarily large point-wise growth. Convolution and inversion theorems are established. An appendix gives sufficient conditions for interchanging repeated Henstock--Kurzweil integrals and gives an estimate on the integral of a product.
