We prove a new version of the Uncertainty Principle of the form \int |f|^2 \lesssim \int_{E^c} |f|^2 + \int_{\Sigma ^c}|\hat f|^2  where the sets E and \Sigma are \epsilon-thin in the following sense: |E \cap D(x, \rho_1(x))| \le \epsilon |D(x, \rho_1(x))| and |\Sigma \cap D(x, \rho_2(x))| \le \epsilon |D(x, \rho_2(x))|. This is an intermediate result between Logvinenko-Sereda's and Wolff's versions of the Uncertainty Principle.
