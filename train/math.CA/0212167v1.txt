For the hypoelliptic differential operators P={\partial^2_ x}+(x^k\partial_ y -x^l{\partial_t})^2 introduced by T. Hoshiro, generalizing a class of M. Christ, in the cases of k and l left open in the analysis, the operators P also fail to be {\em{analytic}} hypoelliptic (except for (k,l)=(0,1)), in accordance with Treves' conjecture. The proof is constructive, suitable for generalization, and relies on evaluating a family of eigenvalues of a non-self-adjoint operator.
