There seems to be quite a bit of room for interesting things related to surfaces M in C^m with real dimension m which are totally real and aspects of several complex variables on C^m around M. A basic case occurs when m = 1, with Cauchy integral operators along curves, holomorphic functions on the complements of curves, and so on. In the present article we briefly indicate a few points concerning these matters.
