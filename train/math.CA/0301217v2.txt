Let F be a class of functions with the uniqueness property: if a function f in F vanishes on a set of positive measure, then f is the zero function. In many instances, we would like to have a quantitative version of this property, e.g. a lower bound for |f| outside a small exceptional set. Such estimates are well-known and useful for polynomials, complex- and real-analytic functions, exponential polynomials. In this work we prove similar results for the Denjoy-Carleman and the Bernstein classes of quasianalytic functions.   In the first part (this arXiv:math.CA/0208233), we considered quasianalytically smooth functions. Here, we deal with classes of functions characterized by exponentially fast approximation by polynomials whose degrees belong to a given very lacunar sequence. We also prove the polynomial spreading lemma and a comparison lemma which are of a certain interest on their own.
