Several questions of approximation theory are discussed: 1) can one approximate stably in L^\infty norm f^\prime given approximation f_\delta, \parallel f_\delta - f \parallel_{L^\infty} < \delta, of an unknown smooth function f(x), such that \parallel f^\prime (x) \parallel_{L^\infty} \leq m_1?   2) can one approximate an arbitrary f \in L^2(D), D \subset \R^n, n \geq 3, is a bounded domain, by linear combinations of the products u_1 u_2, where u_m \in N(L_m), m=1,2, L_m is a formal linear partial differential operator and N(L_m) is the null-space of L_m in D, 3) can one approximate an arbitrary L^2(D) function by an entire function of exponential type whose Fourier transform has support in an arbitrary small open set? Is there an analytic formula for such an approximation? N(L_m) := \{w: L_m w=0 \hbox{in\} D\}?
