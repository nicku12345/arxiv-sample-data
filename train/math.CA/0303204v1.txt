We formulate general principles of building hypergeometric type series from the Jacobi theta functions that generalize the plain and basic hypergeometric series. Single and multivariable elliptic hypergeometric series are considered in detail. A characterization theorem for a single variable totally elliptic hypergeometric series is proved.
