We define a general class of (multiple) integrals of hypergeometric type associated with the Jacobi theta functions. These integrals are related to theta hypergeometric series through the residue calculus. In the one variable case, we get theta function extensions of the Meijer function. A number of multiple generalizations of the elliptic beta integral [S2] associated with the root systems A_n and C_n is described. Some of the C_n-examples were proposed earlier by van Diejen and the author, but other integrals are new. An example of the biorthogonality relations associated with the elliptic beta integrals is considered in detail.
