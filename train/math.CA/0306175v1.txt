Necessary and sufficient for \int_a^bfg_n\to \int_a^bfg for all Henstock--Kurzweil integrable functions f is that g be of bounded variation, g_n be uniformly bounded and of uniform bounded variation and, on each compact interval in (a,b), g_n\to g in measure or in the L^1 norm. The same conditions are necessary and sufficient for \|f(g_n-g)\|\to 0 for all Henstock--Kurzweil integrable functions f. If g_n\to g a.e. then convergence \|fg_n\|\to\|fg\| for all Henstock--Kurzweil integrable functions f is equivalent to \|f(g_n-g)\|\to 0. This extends a theorem due to Lee Peng-Yee.
