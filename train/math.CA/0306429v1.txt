We study the boundedness problem for maximal operators in 3-dimensional Euclidean space associated to hypersurfaces given as the graph of c+f, where f is a mixed homogeneous function which is smooth away from the origin and c is a constant. Our result generalizes a corresponding theorem on mixed homogeneous polynomial functions by A. Iosevich and E. Sawyer.
