We prove local solvability for large classes of operators of the form  L=\sum_{j,k=1}^{2n}a_{jk}V_jV_k+i\alpha U, where the V_j are left-invariant vector fields on the Heisenberg group satisfying the commutation relations [V_j,V_{j+n}]=U for 1\le j\le n, and where A=(a_{jk}) is a complex symmetric matrix with semi-definite real part. Our results widely extend all of the results for the case of non-real, semi-definite matrices A known to date, in particular those obtained recently jointly with F. Ricci under Sj\"ostrand's cone condition.
