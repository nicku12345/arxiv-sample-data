Let \{A_t\}_{t>0} be the dilation group in {\Bbb R}^n generated by the infinitesimal generator M where A_t=\exp(M\log t), and let \varrho\in C^{\infty}({\Bbb R}^n\setminus\{0\}) be a A_t-homogeneous distance function defined on {\Bbb R}^n. For f\in {\frak S}({\Bbb R}^n), we define the maximal quasiradial Bochner-Riesz operator {\frak M}^{\delta}_{\varrho} of index \delta>0 by {\frak M}^{\delta}_{\varrho} f(x)=\sup_{t>0}|{\Cal F}^{-1}[(1-\varrho/t)_+^{\delta}\hat f ](x)|.   If A_t=t I and \{\xi\in {\Bbb R}^n| \varrho(\xi)=1\} is a smooth convex hypersurface of finite type, then we prove in an extremely easy way that {\frak M}^{\delta}_{\varrho} is well defined on H^p({\Bbb R}^n) when \delta=n(1/p-1/2)-1/2 and 0<p<1; moreover, it is a bounded operator from H^p({\Bbb R}^n) into L^{p,\infty}({\Bbb R}^n).   If A_t=t I and \varrho\in C^{\infty}({\Bbb R}^n\setminus\{0\}), we also prove that {\frak M}^{\delta}_{\varrho} is a bounded operator from H^p({\Bbb R}^n) into L^p({\Bbb R}^n) when \delta>n(1/p-1/2)-1/2 and 0<p<1.
