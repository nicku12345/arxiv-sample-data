Carleson's Theorem asserts the pointwise convergence of Fourier series of square integrable functions. We give a complete proof, following joint work of the author and C. Thiele. Over 20 exercises are also detailed. We also discuss the derviation of the theorem on L^p spaces. And discuss a number of complements and extensions of the theorem and proof of Carleson's theorem.
