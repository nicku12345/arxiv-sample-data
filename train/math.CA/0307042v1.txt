Let H^n\cong \Bbb R^{2n}\ltimes \Bbb R be the Heisenberg group and let \mu_t be the normalized surface measure for the sphere of radius t in \Bbb R^{2n}. Consider the maximal function defined by Mf=\sup_{t>0} |f*\mu_t|. We prove for n\ge 2 that M defines an operator bounded on L^p(H^n) provided that p>2n/(2n-1). This improves an earlier result by Nevo and Thangavelu, and the range for L^p boundedness is optimal. We also extend the result to a more general setting of surfaces and to groups satisfying a nondegeneracy condition; these include the groups of Heisenberg type.
