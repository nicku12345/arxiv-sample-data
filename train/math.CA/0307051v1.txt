Let L denote a right-invariant sub-Laplacian on an exponential, hence solvable Lie group G, endowed with a left-invariant Haar measure. Depending on the structure of G, and possibly also that of L, L may admit differentiable L^p-functional calculi, or may be of holomorphic L^p-type for a given p\ne 2. By ``holomorphic L^p-type'' we mean that every L^p-spectral multiplier for L is necessarily holomorphic in a complex neighborhood of some non-isolated point of the L^2-spectrum of L. This can in fact only arise if the group algebra L^1(G) is non-symmetric.   Assume that p\ne 2. For a point l in the dual \frak g ^* of the Lie algebra \frak g of G, we denote by \Omega(l)=Ad^*(G)l the corresponding coadjoint orbit. We prove that every sub-Laplacian on G is of holomorphic L^p-type, provided there exists a point l\in \frak g ^* satisfying ``Boidol's condition'' (which is equivalent to the non-symmetry of L^1(G)), such that the restriction of \Omega(l) to the nilradical of \frak g is closed.
