In this paper we refer to the reconstruction formulas given in L.-E. Andersson's On the determination of a function from spherical averages, which are often used in applications such as SAR and SONAR. We demonstrate that the first one of these formulas does not converge given physically reasonable assumptions. An alternative is proposed and it is shown that the second reconstruction formula is well-defined but might be difficult to compute numerically.
