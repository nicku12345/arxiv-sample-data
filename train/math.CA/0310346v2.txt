For a Schwartz function f on the plane and a non-zero v\in\ZR^2 define the Hilbert transform of f in the direction v to be  H_vf(x)=\text{p.v.}\int_\ZR f(x-vy) \frac{dy}y  Let \zeta be a Schwartz function with frequency support in the annulus 1\le| \xi|\le2. We prove that the maximal operator  \sup_{\abs v=1}\abs{H_v{\zeta}* f}  maps L^2 into weak L^2, and L^p into L^p for p>2.   The L^2 estimate is sharp. The method of proof is based upon techniques related to the pointwise convergence of Fourier series, especially the recent proof given by Lacey and Thiele.
