In the first part of the paper we prove a bi-parameter version of a well known multilinear theorem of Coifman and Meyer. As a consequence, we generalize the Kato-Ponce inequality in nonlinear PDE, obtaining a fractional Leibnitz rule for derivatives in the x_1 and x_2 directions simultaneously. Then, we show that the double bilinear Hilbert transform does not satisfy any L^p estimates.
