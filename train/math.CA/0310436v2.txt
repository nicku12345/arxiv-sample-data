This paper presents explicit algebraic transformations of some Gauss hypergeometric functions. Specifically, the transformations considered apply to hypergeometric solutions of hypergeometric differential equations with the local exponent differences 1/K,1/L,1/M such that K,L,M are positive integers and 1/K+1/L+1/M<1. All algebraic transformations of these Gauss hypergeometric functions are considered. We show that apart from classical transformations of degree 2, 3, 4, 6 there are several other transformations of degree 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 18, 24. Besides, we present an algorithm to compute relevant Belyi functions explicitly.
