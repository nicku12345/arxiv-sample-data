Basic questions concerning nonsingular multilinear operators with oscillatory factors are posed and partially answered. Lebesgue space norm inequalities are established for multilinear integral operators of Calderon-Zygmund type which incorporate oscillatory factors exp(iP), where P is a real-valued polynomial with large coefficients. A related problem concerning upper bounds for measures of sublevel sets is solved.
