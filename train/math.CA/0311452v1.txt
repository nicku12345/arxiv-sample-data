We find the exact value of the best possible constant C for the weak type (1,1) inequality for the one dimensional centered Hardy-Littlewood maximal operator. We prove that C is the largest root of the quadratic equation 12C^{2}-22C+5=0 thus obtaining C=1.5675208.... This is the first time the best constant for one of the fundamental inequalities satisfied by a centered maximal operator is precisely evaluated.
