An analogue of Taylor's formula, which arises by substituting the classical derivative by a divided difference operator of Askey-Wilson type, is developed here. We study the convergence of the associated Taylor series. Our results complement a recent work by Ismail and Stanton. Quite surprisingly, in some cases the Taylor polynomials converge to a function which differs from the original one. We provide explicit expressions for the integral remainder. As application, we obtain some summation formulas for basic hypergeometric series. As far as we know, one of them is new. We conclude by studying the different forms of the binomial theorem in this context.
