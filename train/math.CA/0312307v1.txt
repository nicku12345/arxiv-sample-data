We prove several variations on the results of Ricci and Travaglini concerning bounds for convolution with all rotations of a measure supported by a fixed convex curve in the plane. Estimates are obtained for averages over higher-dimensional convex hypersurfaces, smooth k-dimensional surfaces and non-translation invariant families of surfaces.
