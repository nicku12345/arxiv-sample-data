In this paper we study those polynomials orthogonal with respect to a particular weight over the union of disjoint intervals first introduced by N.I. Akhiezer, via a reformulation as a matrix factorization or Riemann-Hilbert problem. This approach complements the method proposed in a previous paper, that involves the construction of a certain meromorphic function on a hyperelliptic Riemann surface. The method described here is based on the general Riemann-Hilbert scheme of the theory of integrable systems and will enable us to derive, in a very straightforward way, the relevant system of Fuchsian differential equations for the polynomials and the associated system of the Schlesinger deformation equations for certain quantities involving the corresponding recurrence coefficients. Both of these equations were obtained earlier by A. Magnus. In our approach, however, we are able to go beyond Magnus's results by actually solving the equations in terms of the Riemann Theta functions. We also show that the related Hankel determinant can be interpreted as the relevant tau function.
