In this paper we consider the formally symmetric differential expression M[\cdot] of any order (odd or even) \geq 2. We characterise the dimension of the quotient space D(T_{\max})/D(T_{\min}) associated with M[\cdot] in terms of the behaviour of the determinants {equation*} \det\limits_{r,s\in {\bf N}_{n}} [[f_{r}g_{s}](\infty)] {equation*} where 1\leq n\leq (order of the expression + 1); here [fg](\infty) = \lim\limits_{x\to\infty}[fg](x), where [fg](x) is the sesquilinear form in f and g associated with M. These results generalise the well-known theorem that M is in the limit-point case at \infty if and only if [fg](\infty) = 0 for every f,g\in the maximal domain \Delta associated with M.
