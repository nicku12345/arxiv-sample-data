We introduce two kinds of multiple little q-Jacobi polynomials by imposing orthogonality conditions with respect to r discrete little q-Jacobi measures on the exponential lattice q^k (k=0,1,2,3,...), where 0 < q < 1. We show that these multiple little q-Jacobi polynomials have useful q-difference properties, such as a Rodrigues formula (consisting of a product of r difference operators). Some properties of the zeros of these polynomials and some asymptotic properties will be given as well.
