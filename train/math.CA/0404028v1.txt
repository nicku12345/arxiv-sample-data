In R^d, define a maximal function in the directions v\in \directions\subset\{x \mid \abs x=1\} by  M^\directions f(x)=\sup_{v\in\directions} \sup_{\zve} \int_{-\ze}^\ze \abs{f(x-vy)} dy.  For a function f on \ZR^d, let S_\zw f denote the Fourier restriction of f to a region \zw. We are especially interested taking \zw to be a sector of R^d with base points at the origin. A sector is a product of the interval (0,\infty) with respect to a choice of (non orthogonal) basis. What is most important is that the basis is a subset of \directions. Consider a collection \zW of pairwise disjoint sectors \zw as above. Assume that M^\directions  maps L^p into L^p, for some 1<p<\zI . Then we have the following Littlewood--Paley inequality  \NORm \Bigl[\sum_{\zw\in\zW}\abs{S_\zw f}^2\Bigr]^{1/2}.q.\lesssim{}\norm f.q., \qquad 2\le q<2 \frac p{p-1}.  The one dimensional analogue of this inequality is due to Rubio de Francia.   The conclusion when the set of vectors is a fixed basis is known, is due to Journ\'e. Our method of proof relies on a phase plane analysis. We introduce a notion of Carleson measures adapted to \directions, and demonstrate a John Nirenberg inequality for these measures. The John Nirenberg inequality, and an obvious L^2 estimate will prove the Theorem.
