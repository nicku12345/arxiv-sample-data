In this paper we present another proofs of the geometrical forms of Paley-Wiener theorems for the Dunkl transform given in [15], and we prove inversion formulas for the Dunl interwining operator Vk and for its dual tVk and we deduce the expression of the representing distributions of the inverse operators vk(-1) and tvk(-1).
