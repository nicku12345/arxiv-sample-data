When a real-valued function of one variable is approximated by its n^{th} degree Taylor polynomial, the remainder is estimated using the Alexiewicz and Lebesgue p-norms in cases where f^{(n)} or f^{(n+1)} are Henstock--Kurzweil integrable. When the only assumption is that f^{(n)} is Henstock--Kurzweil integrable then a modified form of the n^{th} degree Taylor polynomial is used. When the only assumption is that f^{(n)}\in C^0 then the remainder is estimated by applying the Alexiewicz norm to Schwartz distributions of order 1.
