The second order partial difference equation of two variables  \CD u:= A_{1,1}(x) \Delta_1 \nabla_1 u + A_{1,2}(x) \Delta_1 \nabla_2 u + A_{2,1}(x) \Delta_2 \nabla_1 u + A_{2,2}(x) \Delta_2 \nabla_2 u   & \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad + B_1(x) \Delta_1 u + B_2(x) \Delta_2 u = \lambda u,  is studied to determine when it has orthogonal polynomials as solutions. We derive conditions on \CD so that a weight function W exists for which W \CD u is self-adjoint and the difference equation has polynomial solutions which are orthogonal with respect to W. The solutions are essentially the classical discrete orthogonal polynomials of two variables.
