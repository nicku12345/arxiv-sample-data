We prove L^p estimates for the Bi-Carleson operator, which is a natural hybrid of the Carleson maximal operator and the bilinear Hilbert transform. The methods used are essentially based on the treatment of the Walsh analogue of the operator in the prequel of this paper, but with additional technicalities due to the fact that in the Fourier model one cannot obtain perfect localization in both space and frequency.
