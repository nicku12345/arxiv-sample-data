Let L be a linear difference operator with polynomial coefficients. We consider singularities of L that correspond to roots of the trailing (resp. leading) coefficient of L. We prove that one can effectively construct a left multiple with polynomial coefficients L' of L such that every singularity of L' is a singularity of L that is not apparent. As a consequence, if all singularities of L are apparent, then L has a left multiple whose trailing and leading coefficients equal 1.
