We find convergent double series expansions for Legendre's third incomplete elliptic integral valid in overlapping subdomains of the unit square. Truncated expansions provide asymptotic approximations in the neighbourhood of the logarithmic singularity (1,1) if one of the variables approaches this point faster than the other. Each approximation is accompanied by an error bound. For a curve with an arbitrary slope at (1,1) our expansions can be rearranged into asymptotic expansions depending on a point on the curve. For reader's convenience we give some numeric examples and explicit expressions for low-order approximations.
