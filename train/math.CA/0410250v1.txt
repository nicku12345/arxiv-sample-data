In 1991 Tratnik derived two systems of multivariable orthogonal Racah polynomials and considered their limit cases. q-Extensions of these systems are derived, yielding systems of multivariable orthogonal q-Racah polynomials, from which systems of multivariable orthogonal q-Hahn, dual q-Hahn, q-Krawtchouk, q-Meixner, and q-Charlier polynomials follow as special or limit cases.
