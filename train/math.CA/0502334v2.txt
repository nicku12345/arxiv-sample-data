For multiparameter bilinear paraproduct operators B we prove the estimate    B: L^p X L^q --> L^r, 1<p,q\le{}\infty.  Here, 1/p+1/q=1/r and special attention is paid to the case of 0<r<1. (Note that the families of multiparameter paraproducts are much richer than in the one parameter case.) These estimates are the essential step in the version of the multiparameter Coifman-Meyer theorem proved by C. Muscalu, J. Pipher, T. Tao, and C. Thiele. We offer a different proof of these inequalities.
