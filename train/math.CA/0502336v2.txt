Let  M_b be the operator of pointwise multiplication by b, that is \operatorname M_b f=bf. Set [ A,B]={} AB- BA. The Reisz potentials are the operators    R_\alpha f(x)=\int f(x-y)\frac{dy}{\abs y ^{\alpha}},\qquad 0<\alpha<1.  They map L^p\mapsto L^q, for 1-\alpha+\frac1q=\frac1p, a fact we shall take for granted in this paper. A Theorem of Chanillo \cite{MR84j:42027} states that one has the equivalence  \norm [ M_b, R_\alpha].p\to q.\simeq \norm b.\operatorname{BMO}.  with the later norm being that of the space of functions of bounded mean oscillation. We discuss a new proof of this result in a discrete setting, and extend part of the equivalence above to the higher parameter setting.
