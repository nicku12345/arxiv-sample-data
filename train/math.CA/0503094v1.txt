By using a specially constructed cone and the fixed point index theory, this paper investigates the existence of multiple positive solutions for the third-order three-point singular semipositone BVP: \begin{cases} x'''(t)-\ld f(t,x) =0, &t\in(0,1); [.3pc] x(0)=x'(\eta)=x''(1)=0, & \end{cases} where {1/2}<\eta<1, the non-linear term f(t,x):(0,1)\times(0,+\i)\to (-\i,+\i) is continuous and may be singular at t=0, t=1, and x=0, also may be negative for some values of t and x, \ld is a positive parameter.
