Recently Dritschel proves that any positive multivariate Laurent polynomial can be factorized into a sum of square magnitudes of polynomials. We first give another proof of the Dritschel theorem. Our proof is based on the univariate matrix Fejer-Riesz theorem. Then we discuss a computational method to find approximates of polynomial matrix factorization. Some numerical examples will be shown. Finally we discuss how to compute nonnegative Laurent polynomial factorizations in the multivariate setting.
