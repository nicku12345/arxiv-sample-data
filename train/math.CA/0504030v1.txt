Via a random construction we establish necessary conditions for L^p(\ell^q) inequalities for certain families of operators arising in harmonic analysis. In particular we consider dilates of a convolution kernel with compactly supported Fourier transform, vector maximal functions acting on classes of entire functions of exponential type, and a characterization of Sobolev spaces by square functions and pointwise moduli of smoothness.
