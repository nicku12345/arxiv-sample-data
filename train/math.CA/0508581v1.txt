As is well known the kernel of the orthogonal projector onto the polynomials of degree n in L^2(w_{\a,\b}, [-1, 1]) with w_{\a,\b}(t) = (1-t)^\a(1+t)^\b can be written in terms of Jacobi polynomials. It is shown that if the coefficients in this kernel are smoothed out by sampling a C^\infty function then the resulting function has almost exponential (faster than any polynomial) rate of decay away from the main diagonal. This result is used for the construction of tight polynomial frames for L^2(w_{\a,\b}) with elements having almost exponential localization.
