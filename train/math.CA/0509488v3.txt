Let p(x) be a polynomial like function of the form p(x)=(x-r_{1})^{m_{1}}... (x-r_{N})^{m_{N}}, where m_{1},...,m_{N} are given positive real numbers and r_{1}<r_{2}<... <r_{N}. Let \{x_{k}\}  be the critical points of p in (r_{k},r_{k+1}) and define the ratios \sigma_{k}=\dfrac{x_{k}-r_{k}}{r_{k+1}-r_{k}},k=1,2,...,N-1. (\sigma_{1},...,\sigma_{N-1}) is called the \QTR{it}{ratio vector} of p. We extend some some of the results on ratio vectors from earlier papers for the case when m_{1}=... =m_{N}=1, that is, for polynomials of degree n with n distinct real roots. For N=3, we find necessary and sufficient conditions for (\sigma_{1},\sigma_{2})  to be a ratio vector. We also simplify as well as extend some of the proofs for N=4. In particular we show that \dfrac{m_{k}}{m_{k}+... +m_{N}}<\sigma_{k}<\dfrac{m_{1}+... +m_{k}}{m_{1}+... +m_{k+1}}, and that the monotonicity of the ratios does not hold in general for N\geq 3. For N=3 we find necessary and sufficient conditions on m_{1},m_{2},m_{3} which imply that \sigma_{1}<\sigma_{2}. We also prove some results for general N using the theory of \QTR{it}{Groebner bases} and projective elimination theory. One consequence is that for any N\geq 2,\sigma_{1},...,\sigma_{N-1} satisfy a nontrivial polynomial equation in N-1 variables with real coefficients.
