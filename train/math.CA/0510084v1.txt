In this paper we introduce a polynomial frame on the unit sphere \sph of \mathbb{R}^d, for which every distribution has a wavelet-type decomposition. More importantly, we prove that many function spaces on the sphere \sph, such as L^p, H^p and Besov spaces, can be characterized in terms of the coefficients in the wavelet decompositions, as in the usual Euclidean case \mathbb{R}^d. We also study a related nonlinear m-term approximation problem on \sph. In particular, we prove both a Jackson--type inequality and a Bernstein--type inequality associated to wavelet decompositions, which extend the corresponding results obtained by R. A. DeVore, B. Jawerth and V. Popov (``Compression of wavelet decompositions'', {\it Amer. J. Math.} {\bf 114} (1992), no. 4, 737--785).
