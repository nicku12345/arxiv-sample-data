Asymptotic approximations (n \to \infty) to the truncation errors r_n = - \sum_{\nu=0}^{\infty} a_{\nu} of infinite series \sum_{\nu=0}^{\infty} a_{\nu} for special functions are constructed by solving a system of linear equations. The linear equations follow from an approximative solution of the inhomogeneous difference equation \Delta r_n = a_{n+1}. In the case of the remainder of the Dirichlet series for the Riemann zeta function, the linear equations can be solved in closed form, reproducing the corresponding Euler-Maclaurin formula. In the case of the other series considered -- the Gaussian hypergeometric series {}_2 F_1 (a, b; c; z) and the divergent asymptotic inverse power series for the exponential integral E_1 (z) -- the corresponding linear equations are solved symbolically with the help of Maple. The practical usefulness of the new formalism is demonstrated by some numerical examples.
