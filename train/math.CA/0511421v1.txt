Let \phi: \R^d \longrightarrow \C be a compactly supported function which satisfies a refinement equation of the form \phi(x) = \sum_{k\in\Lambda} c_k \phi(Ax - k),\quad c_k\in\C, where \Gamma\subset\R^d is a lattice, \Lambda is a finite subset of \Gamma, and A is a dilation matrix. We prove, under the hypothesis of linear independence of the \Gamma-translates of \phi, that there exists a correspondence between the vectors of the Jordan basis of a finite submatrix of L=[c_{Ai-j}]_{i,j\in\Gamma} and a finite dimensional subspace \mathcal H in the shift invariant space generated by \phi. We provide a basis of \mathcal H and show that its elements satisfy a property of homogeneity associated to the eigenvalues of L. If the function \phi has accuracy \kappa, this basis can be chosen to contain a basis for all the multivariate polynomials of degree less than \kappa. These latter functions are associated to eigenvalues that are powers of the eigenvalues of A^{-1}. Further we show that the dimension of \mathcal H coincides with the local dimension of \phi, and hence, every function in the shift invariant space generated by \phi can be written locally as a linear combination of translates of the homogeneous functions.
