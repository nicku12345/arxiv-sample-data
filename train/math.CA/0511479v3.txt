Let B_\theta  be the family of rectangles in the plane R^2, having slope \theta  with the abscissa. We say a set of slopes \Theta  is D-set if there exists a function f\in L(R^2), such that the basis B_\theta  differentiates integral of f if \theta\not\in\Theta  and \bar D_\theta f(x)=\infty  almost everywhere if \theta\in\Theta . If the condition \bar D_\theta f(x)=\infty  holds on a set of positive measure (instead of a.e.) we shall say it is WD-set. It is proved, that \Theta  is D-set(WD-set) if and only if it is G_\delta (G_{\delta\sigma}).
