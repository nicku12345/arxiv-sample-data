We find an equivalent condition for a continuous vector-valued path to be Lebesgue equivalent to a twice differentiable function. For that purpose, we introduce the notion of a VBG_{{1/2}} function, which plays an analogous role for the second order differentiability as the classical notion of a VBG_* function for the first order differentiability. In fact, for a function f:[a,b]\to X, being Lebesgue equivalent to a twice differentiable function is the same as being Lebesgue equivalent to a differentiable function with a pointwise Lipschitz derivative. We also consider the case when the first derivative can be taken non-zero almost everywhere.
