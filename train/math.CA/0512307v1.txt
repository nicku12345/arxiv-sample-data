The LULU operators, well known in the nonlinear multiresolution analysis of sequences, are extended to functions defined on continuous domain, namely, a real interval \Omega\subseteq\mathbb{R}. Similar to their discrete counterparts, for a given \delta>0 the operators L_\delta and U_\delta form a fully ordered semi-group of four elements. It is shown that the compositions L_\delta\circ U_\delta and U_\delta\circ L_\delta provide locally \delta-monotone approximations for the bounded real functions defined on \Omega. The error of approximation is estimated in terms of the modulus of nonmonotonicity.
