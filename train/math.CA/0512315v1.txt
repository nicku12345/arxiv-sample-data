Let \T (0\leq \alpha <n) be the singular and fractional integrals with variable kernel \Omega(x,z), and [b,\T] be the commutator generated by \T and a Lipschitz function b. In this paper, the authors study the boundedness of [b,\T] on the Hardy spaces, under some assumptions such as the L^r-Dini condition. Similar results and the weak type estimates at the end-point cases are also given for the homogeneous convolution operators \tT (0\leq \alpha <n). The smoothness conditions imposed on \tOmega are weaker than the corresponding known results.
