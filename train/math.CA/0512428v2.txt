We find an equivalent condition for a real function f:[a,b]\to\R to be Lebesgue equivalent to an n-times differentiable function (n\geq 2); a simple solution in the case n=2 appeared in an earlier paper. For that purpose, we introduce the notions of CBVG_{1/n} and SBVG_{1/n} functions, which play analogous roles for the n-th order differentiability as the classical notion of a VBG_* function for the first order differentiability, and the classes CBV_{1/n} and SBV_{{1}/{n}} (introduced by Preiss and Laczkovich) for C^n smoothness. As a consequence of our approach, we obtain that Lebesgue equivalence to n-times differentiable function is the same as Lebesgue equivalence to a function f which is (n-1)-times differentiable with f^{(n-1)}(\cdot) being pointwise Lipschitz. We also characterize the situation when a given function is Lebesgue equivalent to an n-times differentiable function g such that g' is nonzero a.e. As a corollary, we establish a generalization of Zahorski's Lemma for higher order differentiability.
