We consider the time optimal stabilization problem for a nonlinear control system \dot x=f(x,u). Let \tau(y) be the minimum time needed to steer the system from the state y\in\R^n to the origin, and call \A(T) the set of initial states that can be steered to the origin in time \tau(y)\leq T. Given any \ve>0, in this paper we construct a patchy feedback u=U(x) such that every solution of \dot x=f(x, U(x)), x(0)=y\in \A(T) reaches an \ve-neighborhood of the origin within time \tau(y)+\ve.
