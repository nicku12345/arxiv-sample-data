This paper reviews results about free convection near a vertical flat plate embedded in some saturated porous medium. We focus on a third order autonomous differential equation that gives a special class of solutions called similarity solutions. Two cases are under consideration: in the first one we prescribe the temperature on the plate and in the second one we prescribe the heat flux on it. We will also see that the same equation appears in other industrial processes.
