Under certain conditions, we give an estimate from above on the number of differential equations of order r+1 with prescribed regular singular points, prescribed exponents at singular points, and having a quasi-polynomial flag of solutions. The estimate is given in terms of a suitable weight subspace of the tensor power U(\n_-)^{\otimes (n-1)}, where n is the number of singular points in \C and U(\n_-) is the enveloping algebra of the nilpotent subalgebra of \glg_{r+1}.
