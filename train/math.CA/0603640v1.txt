This is the first part of a series of four articles. In this work, we are interested in weighted norm estimates. We put the emphasis on two results of different nature: one is based on a good-\lambda inequality with two-parameters and the other uses Calder\'on-Zygmund decomposition. These results apply well to singular 'non-integral' operators and their commutators with bounded mean oscillation functions. Singular means that they are of order 0, 'non-integral' that they do not have an integral representation by a kernel with size estimates, even rough, so that they may not be bounded on all L^p spaces for 1 < p < \infty. Pointwise estimates are then replaced by appropriate localized L^p-L^q estimates. We obtain weighted L^p estimates for a range of p that is different from (1,\infty) and isolate the right class of weights. In particular, we prove an extrapolation theorem ' \`a la Rubio de Francia' for such a class and thus vector-valued estimates.
