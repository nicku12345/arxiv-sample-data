We find two convergent series expansions for Legendre's first incomplete elliptic integral F(\lambda,k) in terms of recursively computed elementary functions. Both expansions are valid at every point of the unit square 0<\lambda,k<1. Truncated expansions yield asymptotic approximations for F(\lambda,k) as \lambda and/or k tend to unity, including the case when logarithmic singularity \lambda=k=1 is approached from any direction. Explicit error bounds are given at every order of approximation. For the reader's convenience we present explicit expressions for low-order approximations and numerical examples to illustrate their accuracy. Our derivation is based on rearrangements of some known double series expansions, hypergeometric summation algorithms and inequalities for hypergeometric functions.
