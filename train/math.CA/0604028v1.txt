Let f_k be the k-th Fourier coefficient of a function f in terms of the orthonormal Hermite, Laguerre or Jacobi polynomials. We give necessary and sufficient conditions on f for the inequality \sum_{k}|f_k|^2\theta^k<\infty to hold with \theta>1. As a by-product new orthogonality relations for the Hermite and Laguerre polynomials are found. The basic machinery for the proofs is provided by the theory of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces.
