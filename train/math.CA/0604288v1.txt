We study connected branches of non-constant {2\pi-pe}riodic solutions of the Hamilton equation \begin{displaymath} \dot{x}(t)=\lambda J\nabla H(x(t)), \end{displaymath} where \lambda\in\halfline, H\in C^2(\R^n\times\R^n,\R) and  \displaystyle \nabla^2H(x_0)= [ \begin{array}{cc} A&0 0&B \end{array} ]  for x_0\in\nabla H^{-1}(0). The Hessian \nabla^2H(x_0) can be singular. We formulate sufficient conditions for the existence of such branches bifurcating from given (x_0,\lambda_0). As a consequence we prove theorems concerning the existence of connected branches of arbitrary periodic nonstationary trajectories of the Hamiltonian system \dot{x}(t)=J\nabla H(x(t)) emanating from x_0. We describe also minimal periods of trajectories near x_0.
