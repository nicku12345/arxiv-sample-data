We discuss the inequalities for q-integrals because of the fact that the inequalities can be very useful in the future mathematical research. Since q-integral of a function over an interval [a,b] is defined by the difference of two infinite sums, there a lot of unexpected troubles in analyzing analogs of well-known integral inequalities. In this paper, we will signify to some directions to exceed this problem.
