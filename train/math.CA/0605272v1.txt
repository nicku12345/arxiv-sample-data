We characterize the space BV(I) of functions of bounded variation on an arbitrary interval I\subset \mathbb{R}, in terms of a uniform boundedness condition satisfied by the local uncentered maximal operator M_R from BV(I) into the Sobolev space W^{1,1}(I).   By restriction, the corresponding characterization holds for W^{1,1}(I). We also show that if U is open in \mathbb{R}^d, d >1, then boundedness from BV(U) into W^{1,1}(U) fails for the local directional maximal operator M_T^{v}, the local strong maximal operator M_T^S, and the iterated local directional maximal operator M_T^{d}\circ ...\circ M_T^{1}. Nevertheless, if U satisfies a cone condition, then M_T^S:BV(U)\to L^1(U) boundedly, and the same happens with M_T^{v}, M_T^{d} \circ ...\circ M_T^{1}, and M_R.
