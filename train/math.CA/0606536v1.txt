If f is a Henstock--Kurzweil integrable function on the real line, the Alexiewicz norm of f is \|f\|=\sup_I|\int_I f| where the supremum is taken over all intervals I\subset\R. Define the translation \tau_x by \tau_xf(y)=f(y-x). Then \|\tau_xf-f\| tends to 0 as x tends to 0, i.e., f is continuous in the Alexiewicz norm. For particular functions, \|\tau_xf-f\| can tend to 0 arbitrarily slowly. In general, \|\tau_xf-f\|\geq {\rm osc}f |x| as x\to 0, where {\rm osc}f is the oscillation of f. It is shown that if F is a primitive of f then \|\tau_xF-F\|\leq \|f\||x|. An example shows that the function y\mapsto \tau_xF(y)-F(y) need not be in L^1. However, if f\in L^1 then \|\tau_xF-F\|_1\leq \|f\|_1|x|. For a positive weight function w on the real line, necessary and sufficient conditions on w are given so that \|(\tau_xf-f)w\|\to 0 as x\to 0 whenever fw is Henstock--Kurzweil integrable. Applications are made to the Poisson integral on the disc and half-plane. All of the results also hold with the distributional Denjoy integral, which arises from the completion of the space of Henstock--Kurzweil integrable functions as a subspace of Schwartz distributions.
