Let \mu_0 and \mu_1 be measures supported on an unbounded interval and S_{n,\lambda_n} the extremal varying Sobolev polynomial which minimizes \begin{equation*} < P, P >_{\lambda_n}=\int P^2 d\mu_0 + \lambda_n \int P'^2 d\mu_1, \quad \lambda_n >0 \end{equation*} \noindent in the class of all monic polynomials of degree n. The goal of this paper is twofold. On one hand, we discuss how to balance both terms of this inner product, that is, how to choose a sequence (\lambda_n) such that both measures \mu_0 and \mu_1 play a role in the asymptotics of (S_{n, \lambda_n}). On the other, we apply such ideas to the case when both \mu_0 and \mu_1 are Freud weights. Asymptotics for the corresponding S_{n, \lambda_n} are computed, illustrating the accuracy of the choice of \lambda_n .
