The inverse of the error function, \operatorname{inverf}(x), has applications in diffusion problems, chemical potentials, ultrasound imaging, etc. We analyze the derivatives \frac{d^{n}}{dz^{n}} \operatorname*{inverf}(z) |_{z=0}, as n\to \infty using nested derivatives and a discrete ray method. We obtain a very good approximation of \operatorname{inverf}(x) through a high-order Taylor expansion around x=0. We give numerical results showing the accuracy of our formulas.
