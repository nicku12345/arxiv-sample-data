There is a commutative algebra of differential-difference operators, acting on polynomials on R_2, associated with the reflection group B2. This paper presents an integral transform which intertwines this algebra, allowing one free parameter, with the algebra of partial derivatives. The method of proof depends on properties of a certain class of balanced terminating hypergeometric series of 4F3-type. These properties are in the form of recurrence and contiguity relations and are proved herein.
