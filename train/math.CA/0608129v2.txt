We obtain new estimates for a class of oscillatory integral operators with folding canonical relations satisfying a curvature condition. The main lower bounds showing sharpness are proved using Kakeya set constructions. As a special case of the upper bounds we deduce optimal L^p(mathbb{S}^2)\to L^q(R \mathbb{S}^2) estimates for the Fourier extension operator on large spheres in \mathbb{R}^3, which are uniform in the radius R. Two appendices are included, one concerning an application to Lorentz space bounds for averaging operators along curves in R^3, and one on bilinear estimates.
