Transseries in the sense of \'Ecalle are constructed using a topological approach. A general contractive mapping principle is formulated and proved, showing the closure of transseries under a wide class of operations. In the second part we give an overview of results and methods reconstruction of actual functions and solutions of equations from transseries by generalized Borel summation with in ordinary and partial differential and difference equations.
