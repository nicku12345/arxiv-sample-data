For first order differential equations of the form y'=\sum_{p=0}^P F_p(x)y^p and second order homogeneous linear differential equations y''+a(x)y'+b(x)y=0 with locally integrable coefficients having asymptotic (possibly divergent) power series when |x|\to\infty on a ray \arg(x)=const, under some further assumptions, it is shown that, on the given ray, there is a one-to-one correspondence between true solutions and (complete) formal solutions. The correspondence is based on asymptotic inequalities which are required to be uniform in x and optimal with respect to certain weights.
