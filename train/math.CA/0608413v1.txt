We study the \epsilon \to 0 behavior of recurrence relations of the type \sum_{j=0}^l a_j(k\epsilon,\epsilon)y_{k+j}=0, k\in \zdd (l fixed). The a_j are C^{\infty} functions in each variable on I\times [0,\e_0] for a bounded interval I and \e_0>0. Under certain regularity assumptions we find the asymptotic behavior of the solutions of such recurrences. In typical cases there exists a fundamental set of solutions in the form \{\exp(\epi F_m(k\epsilon,\epsilon))\}_{m=1... l} where the functions F_m are C^{\infty} in each variable on the same domain as the a_j, showing in particular that the formal perturbation-series solutions are asymptotic to true solutions of these recurrences. Some applications are also briefly discussed.
