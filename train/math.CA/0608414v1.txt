For analytic nonlinear systems of ordinary differential equations, under some non-degeneracy and integrability conditions we prove that the formal exponential series solutions (trans-series) at an irregular singularity of rank one are Borel summable (in a sense similar to that of Ecalle). The functions obtained by re-summation of the trans-series are precisely the solutions of the differential equation that decay in a specified sector in the complex plane. We find the dependence of the correspondence between the solutions of the differential equation and trans-series as the ray in the complex plane changes (local Stokes phenomenon). We study, in addition, the general solution in \lloc of the convolution equations corresponding, by inverse Laplace transform, to the given system of ODE's, and its analytic properties. Simple analytic identities lead to ``resurgence'' relations and to an averaging formula having, in addition to the properties of the medianization of Ecalle, the property of preserving exponential growth at infinity.
