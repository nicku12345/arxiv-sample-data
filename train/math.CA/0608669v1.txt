In this paper analysis of the concept of {\it associated homogeneous distributions} (generalized functions) is given, and some problems related to these distributions are solved. It is proved that (in the one-dimensional case) there exist {\it only} {\it associated homogeneous distributions} of order k=1. Next, we introduce a definition of {\it quasi associated homogeneous distributions} and provide a mathematical description of all quasi associated homogeneous distributions and their Fourier transform. It is proved that the class of {\it quasi associated homogeneous distributions} coincides with the class of distributions introduced by Gel'fand and Shilov \cite[Ch.I,\S 4.]{G-Sh} as the class of {\it associated homogeneous distributions}. For the multidimensional case it is proved that f is a {\it quasi associated homogeneous distribution} if and only if it satisfies the Euler type system of differential equations. A new type of \Gamma-functions generated by quasi associated homogeneous distributions is defined.
