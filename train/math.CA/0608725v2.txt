The article is devoted to the investigation of smoothness of functions f(x_1,...,x_m) of variables x_1,...,x_m in infinite fields with non-trivial multiplicative ultra-norms, where m\ge 2. Theorems about classes of smoothness C^n or C^n_b of functions with continuous or bounded uniformly continuous on bounded domains partial difference quotients up to the order n are investigated. It is proved, that from f\circ u\in C^n({\bf K},{\bf K}^l) or f\circ u\in C^n_b({\bf K},{\bf K}^l) for each C^{\infty} or C^{\infty }_b curve u: {\bf K}\to {\bf K}^m it follows, that f\in C^n({\bf K}^m,{\bf K}^l) or f\in C^n_b({\bf K}^m,{\bf K}^l) respectively. Moreover, classes of smoothness C^{n,r} and C^{n,r}_b and more general in the sense of Lipschitz for partial difference quotients are considered and theorems for them are proved.
