The affine synthesis operator is shown to map the mixed-norm sequence space \ell^1(\ell^p) surjectively onto L^p(\Rd), 1 \leq p < \infty, assuming the Fourier transform of the synthesizer does not vanish at the origin and the synthesizer has some decay near infinity. Hence the standard norm on f \in L^p(\Rd) is equivalent to the minimal coefficient norm of realizations of f in terms of the affine system.   We further show the synthesis operator maps a discrete Hardy space onto H^1(\Rd), which yields a norm equivalence for Hardy space involving convolution with a discrete Riesz kernel sequence.   Coefficient norm equivalences are established also for Sobolev spaces, by applying difference operators to the coefficient sequences.
