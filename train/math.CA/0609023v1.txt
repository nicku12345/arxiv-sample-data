This survey paper reports on the properties of the fourth-order Bessel-type linear ordinary differential equation, on the generated self-adjoint differential operators in two associated Hilbert function spaces, and on the generalisation of the classical Hankel integral transform. These results are based upon the properties of the classical Bessel and Laguerre secondorder differential equations, and on the fourth-order Laguerre-type differential equation. From these differential equations and their solutions, limit processes yield the fourth-order Bessel-type functions and the associated differential equation.
