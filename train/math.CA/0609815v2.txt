We prove an inequality related to questions in Approximation Theory, Probability Theory, and to Irregularities of Distribution.   Let h_R denote an L ^{\infty} normalized Haar function adapted to a dyadic rectangle R\subset [0,1] ^{3}. We show that there is a postive \eta so that for all integers n, and coefficients  \alpha (R) we have   2 ^{-n} \sum_{\abs{R}=2 ^{-n}} \abs{\alpha(R)} {}\lesssim{} n ^{1 - \eta} \NOrm \sum_{\abs{R}=2 ^{-n}} \alpha(R) h_R >.\infty .   This is an improvement over the `trivial' estimate by an amount of n ^{- \eta}, and the optimal value of \eta (which we do not prove) would be  \eta =\frac12. There is a corresponding lower bound on the L ^{\infty} norm of the Discrepancy function of an arbitary distribution of a finite number of points in the unit cube in three dimensions. The prior result, in dimension 3, is that of J{\'o}zsef Beck \cite{MR1032337}, in which the improvement over the trivial estimate was logarithmic in n. We find several simplifications and extensions of Beck's argument to prove the result above.
