Consider v a Lipschitz unit vector field on R^n and K its Lipschitz constant. We show that the maps S_s:S_s(X) = X + sv(X) are invertible for 0\leq |s|<1/K and define nonsingular point transformations. We use these properties to prove first the differentiation in L^p norm for 1\le p<\infty. Then we show the existence of a universal set of values s\in [-1/2K,1/2K] of measure 1/K for which the Lipschitz unit vector fields v\circ S_s^{-1} satisfy Zygmund's conjecture for all functions in L^p(\R^n) and for each p, 1\leq p< \infty.
