Differential properties for orthogonal polynomials in several variables are studied. We consider multivariate orthogonal polynomials whose gradients satisfy some quasi--orthogonality conditions. We obtain several characterizations for these polynomials including the analogous of the semiclassical Pearson differential equation, the structure relation and a differential--difference equation.
