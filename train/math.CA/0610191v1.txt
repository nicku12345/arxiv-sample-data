The large n behaviour of the hypergeometric polynomial   \FFF{-n}{\sfrac12}{\sfrac12}{\sfrac12-n}{\sfrac12-n}{-1} is considered by using integral representations of this polynomial. This {}_3F_2 polynomial is associated with the Catalan-Larcombe-French sequence. Several other representations are mentioned, with references to the literature, and another asymptotic method is described by using a generating function of the sequence. The results are similar to those obtained by Clark (2004) who used a binomial sum for obtaining an asymptotic expansion.
