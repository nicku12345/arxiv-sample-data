The Littlewood-Paley theory is extended to weighted spaces of distributions on [-1,1] with Jacobi weights  \w(t)=(1-t)^\alpha(1+t)^\beta.  Almost exponentially localized polynomial elements (needlets) \{\phi_\xi\}, \{\psi_\xi\} are constructed and, in complete analogy with the classical case on \RR^n, it is shown that weighted Triebel-Lizorkin and Besov spaces can be characterized by the size of the needlet coefficients \{\ip{f,\phi_\xi}\} in respective sequence spaces.
