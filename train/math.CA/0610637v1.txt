An interesting and recently much studied generalization of the classical Schur class is the class of contractive operator-valued multipliers for the reproducing kernel Hilbert space {\mathcal H}(k_{d}) on the unit ball {\mathbb B}^{d} \subset {\mathbb C}^{d}, where k_{d} is the positive kernel k_{d}(\lambda, \zeta) = 1/(1 - < \lambda, \zeta >) on {\mathbb B}^{d}. We study this space from the point of view of realization theory and functional models of de Branges-Rovnyak type. We highlight features which depart from the classical univariate case: coisometric realizations have only partial uniqueness properties, the nonuniqueness can be described explicitly, and this description assumes a particularly concrete form in the functional-model context.
