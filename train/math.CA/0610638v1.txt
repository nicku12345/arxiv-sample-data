An interesting and recently much studied generalization of the classical Schur class is the class of contractive operator-valued multipliers S for the reproducing kernel Hilbert space {\mathcal H}(k_{d}) on the unit ball {\mathbb B}^{d} \subset {\mathbb C}^{d}, where k_{d} is the positive kernel k_{d}(\lambda, \zeta) = 1/(1 - < \lambda, \zeta >) on {\mathbb B}^{d}. The reproducing kernel space {\mathcal H}(K_{S}) associated with the positive kernel K_{S}(\lambda, \zeta) = (I - S(\lambda) S(\zeta)^{*}) \cdot k_{d}(\lambda, \zeta) is a natural multivariable generalization of the classical de Branges-Rovnyak canonical model space. A special feature appearing in the multivariable case is that the space {\mathcal H}(K_{S}) in general may not be invariant under the adjoints M_{\lambda_{j}}^{*} of the multiplication operators M_{\lambda_{j}} \colon f(\lambda) \mapsto \lambda_{j} f(\lambda) on {\mathcal H}(k_{d}).   We show that invariance of {\mathcal H}(K_{S}) under M_{\lambda_{j}}^{*} for each j = 1, ..., d is equivalent to the existence of a weakly coisometric realization for S of the form S(\lambda) = D + C (I - \lambda_{1}A_{1} ... - \lambda_{d} A_{d})^{-1}(\lambda_{1}B_{1} + ... + \lambda_{d} B_{d}) such that the state operators A_{1}, ..., A_{d} pairwise commute. We show that this special situation always occurs for the case of inner functions S (where the associated multiplication operator M_{S} is a partial isometry), and that inner multipliers are characterized by the existence of such a realization such that the state operators A_{1}, >..., A_{d} satisfy an additional stability property.
