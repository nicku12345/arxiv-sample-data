Almost exponentially localized polynomial kernels are constructed on the unit ball B^d in \RR^d with weights %functions W_\mu(x)= (1-|x|^2)^{\mu-1/2}, \mu \ge 0, by smoothing out the coefficients of the corresponding orthogonal projectors. These kernels are utilized to the design of cubature formulae on B^d with respect to W_\mu(x) and to the construction of polynomial tight frames in L^2(B^d, W_\mu) (called needlets) whose elements have nearly exponential localization.
