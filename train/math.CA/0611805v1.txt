Chaundy and Jolliffe [4] proved that if \{a_{n}\} is a non-increasing (monotonic) real sequence with \lim\limits_{n\to \infty}a_{n}=0, then a necessary and sufficient condition for the uniform convergence of the series \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}a_{n}\sin nx is  \lim\limits_{n\to \infty}na_{n}=0. We generalize (or weaken) the monotonic condition on the coefficient sequence \{a_{n}\} in this classical result to the so-called mean value bounded variation condition and prove that the generalized condition cannot be weakened further. We also establish an analogue to the generalized Chaundy and Jolliffe theorem in the complex space.
