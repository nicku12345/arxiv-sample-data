The present work contributes to the determination of the n-th linear polarization constant c_n(H) of an n-dimensional real Hilbert space H. We provide some new lower bounds on the value of \sup_{\|y\|=1}| x_1,y >... x_n,y |, where x_1, ..., x_n are unit vectors in H. In particular, the results improve an earlier estimate of Marcus. However, the intriguing conjecture c_n(H)=n^{n/2} remains open.
