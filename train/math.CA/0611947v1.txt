The open problem of determining the exact value of the n-th linear polarization constant c_n of \R^n has received considerable attention over the past few years. This paper makes a contribution to the subject by providing a new lower bound on the value of   \sup_{\|{\bf{y}}\|=1}| {\bf{x}}_1,{\bf{y}} ... {\bf{x}}_n,{\bf{y}}   |, where {\bf{x}}_1, ... ,{\bf{x}}_n are unit vectors in \R^n. The new estimate is given in terms of the eigenvalues of the Gram matrix [ {\bf{x}}_i,{\bf{x}}_j ] and improves upon earlier estimates of this kind. However, the intriguing conjecture c_n=n^{n/2} remains open.
