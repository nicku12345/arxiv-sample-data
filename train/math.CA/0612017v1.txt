The present paper deals with lower bounds for the norm of products of linear forms. It has been proved by J. Arias-de-Reyna \cite{ARIAS}, that %for {\mathbb C}^n, the so-called n^{\rm th} linear polarization constant c_n({\mathbb C}^n) is n^{n/2}, for arbitrary n\in\NN. The same value for c_n({\mathbb R}^n) is only conjectured. In a recent work A. Pappas and S. R{\'e}v{\'e}sz prove that c_n({\mathbb R}^n)=n^{n/2} for n \le 5. Moreover, they show that if the linear forms are given as f_j(x)=< x,a_j>, for some unit vectors a_j (1\leq j\leq n), then the product of the f_j's attains at least the value n^{-n/2} at the normalized signed sum of the vectors \{a_j\}_{j=1}^{n} having maximal length. Thus they asked whether this phenomenon remains true for arbitrary n\in{\mathbb N}. We show that for vector systems \{a_j\}_{j=1}^{n} close to an orthonormal system, the Pappas-R{\'e}v{\'e}sz estimate does hold true. Furthermore, among these vector systems the only system giving n^{-n/2} as the norm of the product is the orthonormal system. On the other hand, for arbitrary vector systems we answer the question of A. Pappas and S. R{\'e}v{\'e}sz in the negative when n\in {\mathbb N} is large enough. We also discuss various further examples and counterexamples that may be instructive for further research towards the determination of c_n(\RR^n).
