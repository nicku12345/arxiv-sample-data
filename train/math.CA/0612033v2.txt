Let \mathbb{H} be the general, reduced Heisenberg group. Our main result establishes the inverse-closedness of a class of integral operators acting on L^{p}(\mathbb{H}), given by the off-diagonal decay of the kernel. As a consequence of this result, we show that if \alpha_{1}I+S_{f}, where S_{f} is the operator given by convolution with f, f\in L^{1}_{v}(\mathbb{H}), is invertible in \B(L^{p}(\mathbb{H})), then (\alpha_{1}I+S_{f})^{-1}=\alpha_{2}I+S_{g}, and g\in L^{1}_{v}(\mathbb{H}). We prove analogous results for twisted convolution operators and apply the latter results to a class of Weyl pseudodifferential operators. We briefly discuss relevance to mobile communications.
