It is well known that the classical families of orthogonal polynomials are characterized as eigenfunctions of a second order linear differential/difference operator. In this paper we present a study of classical orthogonal polynomials in a more general context by using the differential (or difference) calculus and Operator Theory. In such a way we obtain a unified representation of them. Furthermore, some well known results related to the Rodrigues operator are deduced. A more general characterization Theorem that the one given in [1] and [2] for the q-polynomials of the q-Askey and Hahn Tableaux, respectively, is established. Finally, the families of Askey-Wilson polynomials, q-Racah polynomials, Al-Salam & Carlitz I and II, and q-Meixner are considered.   [1] R. Alvarez-Nodarse.
