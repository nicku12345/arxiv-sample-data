In this paper we prove that there exists a constant C such that, if S,\Sigma are subsets of \R^d of finite measure, then for every function f\in L^2(\R^d),   \int_{\R^d}|f(x)|^2 dx \leq C e^{C \min(|S||\Sigma|, |S|^{1/d}w(\Sigma), w(S)|\Sigma|^{1/d})} (\int_{\R^d\setminus S}|f(x)|^2 dx + \int_{\R^d\setminus\Sigma}|\hat{f}(x)|^2 dx)  where \hat{f} is the Fourier transform of f and w(\Sigma) is the mean width of \Sigma. This extends to dimension d\geq 1 a result of Nazarov \cite{pp.Na} in dimension d=1.
