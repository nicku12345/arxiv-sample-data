In this paper, we characterize the class of distributions on an homogeneous Lie group \fN that can be extended via Poisson integration to a solvable one-dimensional extension \fS of \fN. To do so, we introducte the \ss'-convolution on \fN and show that the set of distributions that are \ss'-convolvable with Poisson kernels is precisely the set of suitably weighted derivatives of L^1-functions. Moreover, we show that the \ss'-convolution of such a distribution with the Poisson kernel is harmonic and has the expected boundary behaviour. Finally, we show that such distributions satisfy some global weak-L^1 estimates.
