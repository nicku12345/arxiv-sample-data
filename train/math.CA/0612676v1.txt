The goal of this work is to introduce and study fuzzy limits of functions. Two approaches to fuzzy limits of a function are considered. One is based on the concept of a fuzzy limit of a sequence, while another generalizes the conventional epsilon-delta definition. It is demonstrated that these constructions are equivalent. Different properties of fuzzy limits of functions are found. Properties of conventional limits are easily deduced from properties of fuzzy limits. In the second part of this work, the concept of fuzzy limits of a function is extended to provide means to define nontrivial continuity of functions on discrete sets. In addition, fuzzy limits of functions are introduced and studied.
