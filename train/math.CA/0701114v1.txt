In this paper, optimal L^p-L^q estimates are obtained for operators which average functions over polynomial submanifolds, generalizing the k-plane transform. An important advance over previous work is that full L^p-L^q estimates are obtained by methods which have traditionally yielded only restricted weak-type estimates. In the process, one is lead to make coercivity estimates for certain functionals on L^p for p < 1.
