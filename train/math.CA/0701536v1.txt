We suggest an approximation for the zero-balanced Appell hypergeometric function F_1 near the singular point (1,1). Our approximation can be viewed as a generalization of Ramanujan's approximation for zero-balanced {_2F_1} and is expressed in terms of {_3F_2}. We find an error bound and prove some basic properties of the suggested approximation which reproduce the similar properties of the Appell function. Our approximation reduces to the approximation of Carlson-Gustafson when the Appell function reduces to the first incomplete elliptic integral.
