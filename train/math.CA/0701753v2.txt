The purpose of this paper is to prove optimal estimates for solutions of the Kohn-Laplacian for certain classes of model domains in several complex variables. This will be achieved by applying a type of singular integral operator whose novel features (related to product theory and flag kernels) differ essentially from the more standard Calderon-Zygmund operators that have been used in these problems hitherto.
