We show using the Beylkin-Coifman-Rokhlin algorithm in the Haar basis that any singular integral operator can be written as the sum of a bounded operator on L^p, 1<p<\infty, and of a perfect dyadic singular integral operator. This allows to deduce a local T(b) theorem for singular integral operators from the one for perfect dyadic singular integral operators obtained by Hofmann, Muscalu, Thiele, Tao and the first author.
