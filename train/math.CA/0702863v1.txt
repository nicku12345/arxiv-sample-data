In the previous paper (math.CA/0609196) we defined a map, called the hyperbolic Schwarz map, from the one-dimensional projective space to the three-dimensional hyperbolic space by use of solutions of the hypergeometric differential equation, and thus obtained closed flat surfaces belonging to the class of flat fronts. We continue the study of such flat fronts in this paper. First, we introduce the notion of derived Schwarz maps of the hypergeometric differential equation and, second, we construct a parallel family of flat fronts connecting the classical Schwarz map and the derived Schwarz map.
