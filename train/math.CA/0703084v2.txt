We find two-sided inequalities for the generalized hypergeometric function of the form {_{q+1}}F_{q}(-x) with positive parameters restricted by certain additional conditions. Both lower and upper bounds agree with the value of {_{q+1}}F_{q}(-x) at the endpoints of positive semi-axis and are asymptotically precise at one of the endpoints. The inequalities are derived from a theorem asserting the monotony of the quotient of two generalized hypergeometric functions with shifted parameters. The proofs hinge on a generalized Stieltjes representation of the generalized hypergeometric function. This representation also provides yet another method to deduce the second Thomae relation for {_{3}F_{2}}(1) and leads to an integral representations of {_{4}F_{3}}(x) in terms of the Appell function F_3. In the last section of the paper we list some open questions and conjectures.
