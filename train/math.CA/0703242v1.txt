Given a probability measure \mu with infinite support on the unit circle \partial\mathbb{D}=\{z:|z|=1\}, we consider a sequence of paraorthogonal polynomials \h_n(z,\lambda) vanishing at z=\lambda where \lambda \in \T is fixed. We prove that for any fixed z_0 \not \in \supp(d\mu) distinct from \lambda, we can find an explicit \rho>0 independent of n such that either \h_n or \h_{n+1} (or both) has no zero inside the disk B(z_0, \rho), with the possible exception of \lambda.   Then we introduce paraorthogonal polynomials of the second kind, denoted \s_n(z,\lambda). We prove three results concerning \s_n and \h_n. First, we prove that zeros of \s_n and \h_n interlace. Second, for z_0 an isolated point in \supp(d\mu), we find an explicit radius \rt such that either \s_n or \s_{n+1} (or both) have no zeros inside B(z_0,\rt). Finally we prove that for such z_0 we can find an explicit radius such that either \h_n or \h_{n+1} (or both) has at most one zero inside the ball B(z_0,\rt).
