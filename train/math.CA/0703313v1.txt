The affine synthesis operator is shown to map the coefficient space \ell^p surjectively onto L^p, for 0 < p \leq 1. Here the synthesizer need satisfy only mild restrictions, for example having nonzero integral or else periodization that is real-valued, nontrivial and bounded below.   Consequences include an affine atomic decomposition of L^p.   Tools include an analysis operator that acts nonlinearly, in contrast to the usual linear analysis operator for p>1.
