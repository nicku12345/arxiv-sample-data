Starting out from a question posed by T. Erd\'elyi and J. Szabados, we consider Schur-type inequalities for the classes of complex algebraic polynomials having no zeroes within the unit disk D.   The class of polynomials with no zeroes in D - also known as Bernstein- or Lorentz-class - was studied in detail earlier. For real polynomials utilizing the Bernstein-Lorentz representation as convex combinations of fundamental polynomials (1-x)^k(1+x)^{n-k}, G. Lorentz, T. Erd\'elyi and J. Szabados proved a number of improved versions of Schur- (and also Bernstein- and Markov-) type inequalities.   Here we investigate the similar questions for complex polynomials. For complex polynomials the above convex representation is not available. Even worse, the set of complex polynomials, having no zeroes in the unit disk, does not form a convex set. Therefore, a possible proof must go along different lines. In fact such a direct argument was asked for by Erd\'elyi and Szabados already for the real case.   The sharp forms of the Bernstein- and Markov- type inequalities are known, and the right factors are worse for complex coefficients than for real ones. However, here it turns out that Schur-type inequalities hold unchanged even for complex polynomials and for all monotonic, continuous weight functions. As a consequence, it becomes possible to deduce the corresponding Markov inequality from the known Bernstein inequality and the new Schur type inequality with logarithmic weight.
