Weighted Triebel-Lizorkin and Besov spaces on the unit ball B^d in \Rd with weights \W(x)= (1-|x|^2)^{\mu-1/2}, \mu \ge 0, are introduced and explored. A decomposition scheme is developed in terms of almost exponentially localized polynomial elements (needlets) \{\phi_\xi\}, \{\psi_\xi\} and it is shown that the membership of a distribution to the weighted Triebel-Lizorkin or Besov spaces can be determined by the size of the needlet coefficients \{\ip{f,\phi_\xi}\} in appropriate sequence spaces.
