The roots of Bernoulli polynomials, B_n(z), when plotted in the complex plane, accumulate around a peculiar H-shaped curve. Karl Dilcher proved in 1987 that, on compact subsets of \mathbb{C}, the Bernoulli polynomials asymptotically behave like sine or cosine. Here we establish the asmptotic behavior of B_n(nz), compute the distribution of real roots of Bernoulli polynomials and show that, properly rescaled, the complex roots lie on the curve e^{- 2\pi \text{Im}(z)} = 2\pi e |z| or e^{2\pi \text{Im}(z)}= 2\pi e |z|.
