Using the notion of quantum integers associated with a complex number q\neq 0, we define the quantum Hilbert matrix and various extensions. They are Hankel matrices corresponding to certain little q-Jacobi polynomials when |q|<1, and for the special value q=(1-\sqrt{5})/(1+\sqrt{5}) they are closely related to Hankel matrices of reciprocal Fibonacci numbers called Filbert matrices. We find a formula for the entries of the inverse quantum Hilbert matrix.
