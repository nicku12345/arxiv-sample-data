We prove weighted norm inequalities for fractional powers of elliptic operators together with their commutators with BMO functions, encompassing what is known for the classical Riesz potentials and elliptic operators with Gaussian domination by the classical heat operator. The method relies upon a good-\lambda method that does not use any size or smoothness estimates for the kernels.
