Using a variant of the Sobolev Embedding Theorem, we prove an uncertainty principle related to Gabor systems that generalizes the Balian-Low Theorem. Namely, if f\in H^{p/2}(\R) and \hat f\in H^{p'/2}(\R) with 1<p<\infty, \frac{1}{p}+\frac{1}{p'}=1, then the Gabor system \mathcal G(f,1,1) is not a frame for L^2(\R). In the p=1 case, we obtain a generalization of a result of Benedetto, Czaja, Powell, and Sterbenz.
