For a family of weight functions invariant under a finite reflection group, the boundedness of a maximal function on the unit sphere is established and used to prove a multiplier theorem for the orthogonal expansions with respect to the weight function on the unit sphere. Similar results are also established for the weighted space on the unit ball and on the standard simplex.
