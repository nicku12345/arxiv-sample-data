Let f\in L_{2\pi} be a real-valued even function with its Fourier series  \frac{a_{0}}{2}+\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}a_{n}\cos nx, and let S_{n}(f,x), n\geq 1, be the n-th partial sum of the Fourier series. It is well-known that if the nonnegative sequence \{a_{n}\} is decreasing and \lim\limits_{n\to \infty}a_{n}=0, then  \lim\limits_{n\to \infty}\Vert f-S_{n}(f)\Vert_{L}=0 {if and only if} \lim\limits_{n\to \infty}a_{n}\log n=0.  We weaken the monotone condition in this classical result to the so-called mean value bounded variation (MVBV) condition. The generalization of the above classical result in real-valued function space is presented as a special case of the main result in this paper which gives the L^{1}% -convergence of a function f\in L_{2\pi} in complex space. We also give results on L^{1}-approximation of a function f\in L_{2\pi} under the % MVBV condition.
