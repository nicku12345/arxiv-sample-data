In view of the usefulness and importance of the kinetic equation in certain physical problems, the authors derive the explicit solution of a fractional kinetic equation of general character, that unifies and extends earlier results. Further, an alternative shorter method based on a result developed by the authors is given to derive the solution of a fractional diffusion equation.
