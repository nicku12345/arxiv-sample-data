We consider divergence form elliptic operators L=-\dv A(x)\nabla, defined in \mathbb{R}^{n+1}=\{(x,t)\in\mathbb{R}^{n}\times\mathbb{R}\}, n \geq 2, where the L^{\infty} coefficient matrix A is (n+1)\times(n+1), uniformly elliptic, complex and t-independent. Using recently obtained results concerning the boundedness and invertibility of layer potentials associated to such operators, we show that if Lu=0 in \mathbb{R}^{n+1}_+, then for any vector-valued {\bf v} \in W^{1,2}_{loc}, we have the bilinear estimate |\iint_{\mathbb{R}^{n+1}_+} \nabla u \cdot \bar{{\bf v}} dx dt |\leq C\sup_{t>0} \|u(\cdot,t)\|_{L^2(\mathbb{R}^n)}(\||t \nabla {\bf v}\|| + \|N_*{\bf v}\|_{L^2(\mathbb{R}^n)}), where \||F\|| \equiv (\iint_{\mathbb{R}^{n+1}_+} |F(x,t)|^2 t^{-1} dx dt)^{1/2}, and where N_* is the usual non-tangential maximal operator. The result is new even in the case of real symmetric coefficients, and generalizes the analogous result of Dahlberg for harmonic functions on Lipschitz graph domains.
