Algebraic solutions of the sixth Painleve equation can be computed using pullback transformations of hypergeometric equations with respect to specially ramified rational coverings. In particular, as was noticed by the second author and Doran, some algebraic solutions can be constructed from a rational covering alone, without computation of the pullbacked Fuchsian equation. But the same covering can be used to pullback different hypergeometric equations, resulting in different algebraic Painleve VI solutions. This paper presents computations of explicit RS-pullback transformations, and derivation of algebraic Painleve VI solutions from them.
