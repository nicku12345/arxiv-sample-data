The name Schur is associated with many terms and concepts that are widely used in a number of diverse fields of mathematics and engineering. This survey article focuses on Schur's work in analysis. Here too, Schur's name is commonplace: The Schur test and Schur-Hadamard multipliers (in the study of estimates for Hermitian forms), Schur convexity, Schur complements, Schur's results in summation theory for sequences (in particular, the fundamental Kojima-Schur theorem), the Schur-Cohn test, the Schur algorithm, Schur parameters and the Schur interpolation problem for functions that are holomorphic and bounded by one in the unit disk. In this survey, we discuss all of the above mentioned topics and then some, as well as some of the generalizations that they inspired. There are nine sections of text, each of which is devoted to a separate theme based on Schur's work. Each of these sections has an independent bibliography. There is very little overlap. A tenth section presents a list of the papers of Schur that focus on topics that are commonly considered to be analysis. We begin with a review of Schur's less familiar papers on the theory of commuting differential operators.
