Nonlinear perturbation of Fuchsian systems are studied in a region including two singularities. It is proved that such systems are generally not analytically equivalent to their linear part (they are not linearizable) and the obstructions are found constructively, as a countable set of numbers. Furthermore, assuming a polynomial character of the nonlinear part, it is shown that there exists a unique formal "correction" of the nonlinear part so that the "corrected" system is formally linearizable.   Normal forms of these systems are found, providing also their classification.
