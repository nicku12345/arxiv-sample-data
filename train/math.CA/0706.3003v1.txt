Starting from the Rodrigues representation of polynomial solutions of the general hypergeometric-type differential equation complementary polynomials are constructed using a natural method. Among the key results is a generating function in closed form leading to short and transparent derivations of recursion relations and an addition theorem. The complementary polynomials satisfy a hypergeometric-type differential equation themselves, have a three-term recursion among others and obey Rodrigues formulas. Applications to the classical polynomials are given.
