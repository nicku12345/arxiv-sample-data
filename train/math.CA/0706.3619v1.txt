In this paper, we will first show that the maximal operator S_*^\alpha of spherical partial sums S_R^\alpha, associated to Dunkl transform on \mathbb{R} is bounded on L^p(\mathbb{R}, |x|^{2\alpha+1} dx) functions when \frac{4(\alpha+1)}{2\alpha+3}<p<\frac{4(\alpha+1)}{2\alpha+1}, and it implies that, for every L^p(\mathbb{R}, |x|^{2\alpha+1} dx) function f(x), S_R^\alpha f(x) converges to f(x) almost everywhere as R\to \infty. On the other hand we obtain a sharp version by showing that S_*^\alpha is bounded from the Lorentz space L^{p_i,1}(\mathbb{R}, |x|^{2\alpha+1}) into L^{p_i,\infty}(\mathbb{R}, |x|^{2\alpha+1}),\quad i=0,1 where p_0=\frac{4(\alpha+1)}{2\alpha+3} and p_1=\frac{4(\alpha+1)}{2\alpha+1}.
