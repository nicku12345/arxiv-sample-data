This paper establishes the optimal decay rate for scalar oscillatory integrals in n variables which satisfy a nondegeneracy condition on the third derivatives. The estimates proved are stable under small linear perturbations, as encountered when computing the Fourier transform of surface-carried measures. The main idea of the proof is to construct a nonisotropic family of balls which locally capture the scales and directions in which cancellation occurs.
