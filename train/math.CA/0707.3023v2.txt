We prove that for all p>1/2 there exists a constant \gamma_p>0 such that, for any symmetric measurable set of positive measure E\subset \TT and for any \gamma<\gamma_p, there is an idempotent trigonometrical polynomial f satisfying \int_E |f|^p > \gamma \int_{\TT} |f|^p. This disproves a conjecture of Anderson, Ash, Jones, Rider and Saffari, who proved the existence of \gamma_p>0 for p>1 and conjectured that it does not exists for p=1.   Furthermore, we prove that one can take \gamma_p=1 when p>1 is not an even integer, and that polynomials f can be chosen with arbitrarily large gaps when p\neq 2. This shows striking differences with the case p=2, for which the best constant is strictly smaller than 1/2, as it has been known for twenty years, and for which having arbitrarily large gaps with such concentration of the integral is not possible, according to a classical theorem of Wiener.   We find sharper results for 0<p\leq 1 when we restrict to open sets, or when we enlarge the class of idempotent trigonometric polynomials to all positive definite ones.
