We give characterizations of radial Fourier multipliers as acting on radial L^p-functions, 1<p<2d/(d+1), in terms of Lebesgue space norms for Fourier localized pieces of the convolution kernel. This is a special case of corresponding results for general Hankel multipliers. Besides L^p-L^q bounds we also characterize weak type inequalities and intermediate inequalities involving Lorentz spaces. Applications include results on interpolation of multiplier spaces.
