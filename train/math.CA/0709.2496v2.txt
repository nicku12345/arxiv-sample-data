The elementary resolution of singularities algorithm of the author's earlier paper (math.CA/0609217) is developed further, replacing the quasibump functions in the blown up coordinates with the characteristic function of a rectangle times a smooth function. Such functions are easier to deal with, and as application the existence of asymptotic expansions for oscillatory integrals and related objects is given an elementary proof. In addition, some more detailed information about these expansions is given.
