We introduce certain linear positive operators and study some approximation properties of these operators in the space of functions, continuous on a compact set, of two variables. We also find the order of this approximation by using modulus of continuity. Moreover we define an rth order generalization of these operators and observe its approximation properties. Furthermore, we study the convergence of the linear positive operators in a weighted space of functions of two variables and find the rate of this convergence using weighted modulus of continuity.
