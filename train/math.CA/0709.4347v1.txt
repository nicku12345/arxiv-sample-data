Let G be the Lie group given by the semidirect product of R^2 and R^+ endowed with the Riemannian symmetric space structure. Let X_0, X_1, X_2 be a distinguished basis of left-invariant vector fields of the Lie algebra of G and define the Laplacian \Delta=-(X_0^2+X_1^2+X_2^2). In this paper we consider the first order Riesz transforms R_i=X_i\Delta^{-1/2} and S_i=\Delta^{-1/2}X_i, for i=0,1,2. We prove that the operators R_i, but not the S_i, are bounded from the Hardy space H^1 to L^1. We also show that the second order Riesz transforms T_{ij}=X_i\Delta^{-1}X_j are bounded from H^1 to L^1, while the Riesz transforms S_{ij}=\Delta^{-1}X_iX_j and R_{ij}=X_iX_j\Delta^{-1} are not.
