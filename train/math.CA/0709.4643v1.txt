Aim of this paper is to investigate the existence of periodic solutions of a nonlinear planar autonomous system having a limit cycle x_0 of least period T_0>0 when it is perturbed by a small parameter, T_1-periodic, perturbation. In the case when T_0/T_1 is a rational number l/k, with l, k prime numbers, we provide conditions to guarantee, for the parameter perturbation e>0 sufficiently small, the existence of klT_0-periodic solutions x_e of the perturbed system which converge to the trajectory x_1 of the limit cycle as e->0. Moreover, we state conditions under which T=klT_0 is the least period of the periodic solutions x_e. We also suggest a simple criterion which ensures that these conditions are verified. Finally, in the case when T_0/T_1 is an irrational number we show the nonexistence, whenever T>0 and e>0, of T-periodic solutions x_e of the perturbed system converging to x_1. The employed methods are based on the topological degree theory.
