Let P_e\in C^0(R^n,R^n) be the Poincare-Andronov operator over period T>0 of the T-periodically perturbed autonomous system x'=f(x)+e g(t,x,e), where e>0 is small. Assuming that for e=0 this system has a T-periodic limit cycle x_0 we evaluate the topological degree d(I-P_e,U) of I-P_e on an open bounded set U whose boundary contains x_0([0,T]) and does not contain other fixed points of P_0. We give an explicit formula connecting d(I-P_e,U) with topological indexes of zeros of the associated Malkin's bifurcation function. The goal of the paper is to prove Mawhin's conjecture which claims that d(I-P_e,U) can be any integer in spite of the fact that the measure of the set of fixed points of P_0 on \partial U is zero.
