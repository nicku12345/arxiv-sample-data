In this paper we provide conditions to ensure the existence, for e>0 sufficiently small, of periodic solutions of given period T>0 in a prescribed domain U for a class of singularly perturbed first order differential systems. Here e>0 is the perturbation parameter. Our approach, based on the topological degree theory and the averaging theory, permits to weaken the conditions in [K.R. Schneider, Vibrational control of singularly perturbed systems, in "Lectures Notes in Control and Information Science", 259, 397-408, Springer, London, 2001, Theorem 2] under which the existence of periodic solutions is proved.
