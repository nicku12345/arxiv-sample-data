We consider the operator F(u) = u' + f(t,u(t)) acting on periodic real valued functions. Generically, critical points of F are infinite dimensional Morin-like singularities and we provide operational characterizations of the singularities of different orders. A global Lyapunov-Schmidt decomposition of F converts F into adapted coordinates, \Fbd(\tilde v, \overline u) = (\tilde v, \overline v), where \tilde v is a function of average zero and both \overline u and \overline v are numbers. Thus, global geometric aspects of F reduce to the study of a family of one-dimensional maps: we use this approach to obtain normal forms for several nonlinearities f. For example, we characterize autonomous nonlinearities giving rise to global folds and, in general, we show that F is a global fold if all critical points are folds. Also, f(t,x) = x^3 - x, or, more generally, the Cafagna-Donati nonlinearity, yield global cusps; for F interpreted as a map between appropriate Hilbert spaces, the requested changes of variable to bring F to normal form can be taken to be diffeomorphisms. A key ingredient in the argument is the contractibility of both the critical set and the set of non-folds for a generic autonomous nonlinearity. We also obtain a numerical example of a polynomial f of degree 4 for which F contains butterflies (Morin singularities of order 4)---% it then follows that F(u) = v has six solutions for some v.
