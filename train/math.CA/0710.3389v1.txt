The orthogonal polynomials p_n satisfy Tur\'an's inequality if p_n^2(x)-p_{n-1}(x)p_{n+1}(x)\ge 0 for n\ge 1 and for all x in the interval of orthogonality. We give general criteria for orthogonal polynomials to satisfy Tur\'an's inequality. This yields the known results for classical orthogonal polynomials as well as new results, for example, for the q--ultraspherical polynomials.
