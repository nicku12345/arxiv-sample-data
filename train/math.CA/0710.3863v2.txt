In this paper we will introduce the methodology of analysis of the convex hull of the attractors of iterated functional systems (IFS) - compact fixed sets of self-similarity mapping. The method is based on a function which for a direction, gives width in that direction. We can write the self similarity equation in terms of this function, solve and analyze them. Using this function we can quickly check if the distance from K of a given x is smaller than a given distance or even compute analytically convex hull area and the length of its boundary
