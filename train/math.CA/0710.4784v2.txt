We present here the solution of the problem on linearization of fourth-order equations by means of point transformations. We show that all fourth-order equations that are linearizable by point transformations are contained in the class of equations which is linear in the third-order derivative. We provide the linearization test and describe the procedure for obtaining the linearizing transformations as well as the linearized equation.
