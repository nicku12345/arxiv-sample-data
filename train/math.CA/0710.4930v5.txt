It is well known that the family of Hahn polynomials \{h_n^{\alpha,\beta}(x;N)\}_{n\ge 0} is orthogonal with respect to a certain weight function up to N. In this paper we present a factorization for Hahn polynomials for a degree higher than N and we prove that these polynomials can be characterized by a \Delta-Sobolev orthogonality.   We also present an analogous result for dual-Hahn, Krawtchouk, and Racah polynomials and give the limit relations between them for all n\in \XX N_0. Furthermore, in order to get this results for the Krawtchouk polynomials we will get a more general property of orthogonality for Meixner polynomials.
