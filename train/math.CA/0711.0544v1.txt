We prove that the Nevalinna-Pick algorithm provides different homeomorphisms between certain topological spaces of measures, analytic functions and sequences of complex numbers. This algorithm also yields a continued fraction expansion of every Schur function, whose approximants are identified. The approximants are quotients of rational functions which can be understood as the rational analogs of the Wall polynomials. The properties of these Wall rational functions and the corresponding approximants are studied. The above results permit us to obtain a Khrushchev's formula for orthogonal rational functions. An introduction to the convergence of the Wall approximants in the indeterminate case is also presented.
