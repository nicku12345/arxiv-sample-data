We say that Wiener's property holds for the exponent p>0 if we have that whenever a positive definite function f belongs to L^p(-\epsilon,\epsilon) for some \epsilon>0, then f necessarily belongs to L^p(\TT), too. This holds true for p\in 2\NN by a classical result of Wiener. Recently various concentration results were proved for idempotents and positive definite functions on measurable sets on the torus. These new results enable us to prove a sharp version of the failure of Wiener's property for p\notin 2\NN. Thus we obtain strong extensions of results of Wainger and Shapiro, who proved the negative answer to Wiener's problem for p\notin 2\NN.
