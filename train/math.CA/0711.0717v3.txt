We study pointwise convergence of the solutions to Schr\"odinger equations with initial datum f\in H^s(\mathbb R^n). The conjecture is that the solution e^{it\Delta}f converges to f almost everywhere for all f\in H^s(\mathbb R^n) if and only if s\ge 1/4. The conjecture is known true for one spatial dimension and the convergence when s>1/2 was verified for n\ge 2. Recently, concrete progresses have been made in \mathbb R^2 for some s<1/2. However, when n\ge 3 no positive result is known for the initial datum f\in H^s(\mathbb R^n), s\le 1/2. We show that \lim_{t\to 0} e^{it\Delta}f= f a.e. for f\in H^s(\mathbb R^3) whenever s>1/2-1/{24}.
