Using geometric methods for linearizing systems of second order cubically semi-linear ordinary differential equations, we extend to the third order by differentiating the second order equation. This yields criteria for linearizability of a class of third order semi-linear ordinary differential equations, which is distinct from the classes available in the literature. Some examples are given and discussed.
