We provide linearizability criteria for a class of systems of third-order ordinary differential equations (ODEs) that is cubically semi-linear in the first derivative, by differentiating a system of second-order quadratically semi-linear ODEs and using the original system to replace the second derivative. The procedure developed splits into two cases, those where the coefficients are constant and those where they are variables. Both cases are discussed and examples given.
