Given \{P_n \} a sequence of monic orthogonal polynomials, we analyze their linear combinations \{Q_n \}with constant coefficients and fixed length k+1. Necessary and sufficient conditions are given for the orthogonality of the monic sequence \{Q_n \} as well as an interesting interpretation in terms of the Jacobi matrices associated with \{P_n \} and \{Q_n \}. Moreover, in the case k=2, we characterize the families \{P_n \} such that the corresponding polynomials \{Q_n \} are also orthogonal.
