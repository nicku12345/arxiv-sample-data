The aim of this paper is to bring into the picture a new phenomenon in the theory of orthogonal matrix polynomials satisfying second order differential equations. The last few years have witnessed some examples of a (fixed) family of orthogonal matrix polynomials whose elements are common eigenfunctions of several linearly independent second order differential operators. We show that the dual situation is also possible: there are examples of different families of matrix polynomials, each family orthogonal with respect to a different weight matrix, whose elements are eigenfunctions of a common second order differential operator.   These examples are constructed by adding a discrete mass at certain point to a weight matrix: \widetilde{W}=W+\delta_{t_0}M(t_0). Our method consists in showing how to choose the discrete mass M(t_0), the point t_0 where the mass lives and the weight matrix W so that the new weight matrix \widetilde{W} inherits some of the symmetric second order differential operators associated with W. It is well known that this situation is not possible for the classical scalar families of Hermite, Laguerre and Jacobi.
