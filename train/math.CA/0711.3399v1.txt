In this paper we prove that if \Omega\in\mathbb{R}^n is a bounded John domain, the following weighted Poincare-type inequality holds:  \inf_{a\in \mathbb{R}}\| (f(x)-a) w_1(x) \|_{L^q(\Omega)} \le C \|\nabla f(x) d(x)^\alpha w_2(x) \|_{L^p(\Omega)}  where f is a locally Lipschitz function on \Omega, d(x) denotes the distance of x to the boundary of \Omega, the weights w_1, w_2 satisfy certain cube conditions, and \alpha \in [0,1] depends on p,q and n. This result generalizes previously known weighted inequalities, which can also be obtained with our approach.
