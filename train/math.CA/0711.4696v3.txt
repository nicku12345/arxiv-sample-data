We introduce two explicit examples of polynomials orthogonal on the unit circle. Moments and the reflection coefficients are expressed in terms of Jacobi elliptic functions. We find explicit expression for these polynomials in terms of a new type of elliptic hypergeometric function. We show that obtained polynomials are orthogonal on the unit circle with respect to a dense point meausure, i.e. the spectrum consists from infinite number points of increase which are dense on the unit circle. We construct also corresponding explicit systems of polynomials orthogonal on the interval of the real axis with respect to a dense point measure. They can be considered as an elliptic generalization of the Askey-Wilson polynomials of a special type.
