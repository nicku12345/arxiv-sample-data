The linearization of complex ordinary differential equations is studied by extending Lie's criteria for linearizability to complex functions of complex variables. It is shown that the linearization of complex ordinary differential equations implies the linearizability of systems of partial differential equations corresponding to those complex ordinary differential equations. The invertible complex transformations can be used to obtain invertible real transformations that map a system of nonlinear partial differential equations into a system of linear partial differential equation. Explicit invariant criteria are given that provide procedures for writing down the solutions of the linearized equations. A few non-trivial examples are mentioned.
