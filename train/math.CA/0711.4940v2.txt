Let m_{2}<m_{1} be two given nonnegative integers with n=m_{1}+m_{2}+1. For suitably differentiable f, we let P,Q\in \pi_{n} be the Hermite polynomial interpolants to f which satisfy P^{(j)}(a)=f^{(j)}(a),j=0,1,...,m_{1} and P^{(j)}(b)=f^{(j)}(b),j=0,1,...,m_{2}, Q^{(j)}(a)=f^{(j)}(a),j=0,1,...,m_{2} and Q^{(j)}(b)=f^{(j)}(b),j=0,1,...,m_{1}. Suppose that f\in C^{n+2}(I) with f^{(n+1)}(x)\neq 0 for x\in (a,b). If m_{1}-m_{2} is even, then there is a unique x_{0},a<x_{0}<b, such that P(x_{0})=Q(x_{0}). If m_{1}-m_{2} is odd, then there is a unique x_{0},a<x_{0}<b, such that f(x_{0})=\tfrac{1}{2}(P(x_{0})+Q(x_{0})) . x_{0} defines a strict, symmetric mean, which we denote by M_{f,m_{1},m_{2}}(a,b). We prove various properties of these means. In particular, we show that f(x)=x^{m_{1}+m_{2}+2} yields the arithmetic mean, f(x)=x^{-1} yields the harmonic mean, and f(x)=x^{(m_{1}+m_{2}+1)/2} yields the geometric mean.
