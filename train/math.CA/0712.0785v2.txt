The linear complete differential resultant of a finite set of linear ordinary differential polynomials is defined. We study the computation by linear complete differential resultants of the implicit equation of a system of n linear differential polynomial parametric equations in n-1 differential parameters. We give necessary conditions to ensure properness of the system of differential polynomial parametric equations.
