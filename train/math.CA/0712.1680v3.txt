The theory and applications of dynamic derivatives on time scales has recently received considerable attention. The primary purpose of this paper is to give basic properties of diamond-\alpha derivatives which are a linear combination of delta and nabla dynamic derivatives on time scales. We prove a generalized version of Jensen's inequality on time scales via the diamond-\alpha integral and present some corollaries, including H\"{o}lder's and Minkowski's diamond-\alpha integral inequalities.
