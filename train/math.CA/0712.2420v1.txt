In this article we prove that the n-linear operator whose symbol is the characteristic function of the simplex \Delta_n = \xi_1 < ... < \xi_n is bounded from L^2 \times ... \times L^2 into L^{2/n}, generalizing in this way our previous work on the "bi-est" operator (which corresponds to the case n=3) as well as Lacey-Thiele theorem on the bi-linear Hilbert transform (which corresponds to the case n=2).
