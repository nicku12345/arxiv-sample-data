Orthogonal polynomials of degree n with respect to the weight function W_\mu(x) = (1-\|x\|^2)^\mu on the unit ball in \RR^d are known to satisfy the partial differential equation    [ \Delta - \la x, \nabla \ra^2 -   (2 \mu +d) \la x, \nabla \ra \right ] P = -n(n+2 \mu+d) P  for \mu > -1. The singular case of \mu = -1,-2, ... is studied in this paper. Explicit polynomial solutions are constructed and the equation for \nu = -2,-3,... is shown to have complete polynomial solutions if the dimension d is odd. The orthogonality of the solution is also discussed.
