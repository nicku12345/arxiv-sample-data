We start from an interpretation of the BC_2-symmetric "Type I" (elliptic Dixon) elliptic hypergeometric integral evaluation as a formula for a Casoratian of the elliptic hypergeometric equation, and give an extension to higher-dimensional integrals and higher-order hypergeometric functions. This allows us to prove the corresponding elliptic beta integral and transformation formula in a new way, by proving both sides satisfy the same difference equations, and that the difference equations satisfy a Galois-theoretical condition that ensures uniqueness of simultaneous solution.
