We prove a more general version of the Gruss inequality by using the recent theory of combined dynamic derivatives on time scales and the more general notions of diamond-alpha derivative and integral. For the particular case when alpha = 1, one gets a delta-integral Gruss inequality on time scales; for alpha = 0 a nabla-integral Gruss inequality. If we further restrict ourselves by fixing the time scale to the real (or integer) numbers, then the standard continuous (discrete) inequalities are obtained.
