We prove a conjecture of Lacey and Li in the case that the vector field depends only on one variable. Specifically: let v be a vector field defined on the unit square such that v(x,y) = (1,u(x)) for some measurable u from [0,1] to [0,1]. Fix a small parameter delta and let Z be the collection of rectangles R of a fixed width such that delta much of the vector field inside R is pointed in (approximately) the same direction as R. We show that the maximal averaging operator associated to the collection Z is bounded on L^p for p>1 with constants comparable to (delta)^(-1) .
