We consider certain subsets of the space of n\times n matrices of the form K = \cup_{i=1}^m SO(n)A_i, and we prove that for p>1, q \geq 1 and for connected \Omega'\subset\subset\Omega\subset \R^n, there exists positive constant a<1 depending on n,p,q, \Omega, \Omega' such that for  \veps=\| {dist}(Du, K)\|_{L^p(\Omega)}^p we have \inf_{R\in K}\|Du-R\|^p_{L^p(\Omega')}\leq M\veps^{1/p} provided u satisfies the inequality \| D^2 u\|_{L^q(\Omega)}^q\leq a\veps^{1-q}. Our main result holds whenever m=2, and also for {\em generic} m\le n in every dimension n\ge 3, as long as the wells SO(n)A_1,..., SO(n)A_m satisfy a certain connectivity condition. These conclusions are mostly known when n=2, and they are new for n\ge 3.
