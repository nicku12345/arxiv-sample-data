In this paper we consider L^p boundedness of some commutators of Riesz transforms associated to Schr\"{o}dinger operator P=-\Delta+V(x) on \mathbb{R}^n, n\geq 3. We assume that V(x) is non-zero, nonnegative, and belongs to B_q for some q \geq n/2. Let T_1=(-\Delta+V)^{-1}V,\ T_2=(-\Delta+V)^{-1/2}V^{1/2} and T_3=(-\Delta+V)^{-1/2}\nabla. We obtain that [b,T_j] (j=1,2,3) are bounded operators on L^p(\mathbb{R}^n) when p ranges in a interval, where b \in \mathbf{BMO}(\mathbb{R}^n). Note that the kernel of T_j (j=1,2,3) has no smoothness.
