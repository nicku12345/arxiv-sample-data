This text grew out of notes I have used in teaching a one quarter course on integration at the advanced undergraduate level. My intent is to introduce the Lebesgue integral in a quick, and hopefully painless, way and then go on to investigate the standard convergence theorems and a brief introduction to the Hilbert space of L^2 functions on the interval.   The actual construction of Lebesgue measure and proofs of its key properties are relegated to an appendix. Instead the text introduces Lebesgue measure as a generalization of the concept of length and motivates its key properties: monotonicity, countable additivity, and translation invariance.
