We consider the Euler type integral associated to the configuration space of points on an elliptic curve, which is an analogue of the hypergeometric function associated to the configuration space of points on a projective line. We calculate the {\it twisted homology group}, with coefficients in the local system associated to a power function g^{\alpha} of an elliptic function g, and the intersection form. Applying these calculations, we describe the {\it connection matrices} representing the linear isomorphisms induced from analytic continuations of the functions defined by the integrations of g^{\alpha} over twisted cycles.
