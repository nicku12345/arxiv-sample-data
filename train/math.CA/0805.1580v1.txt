We prove that the generalized Carleson operator C_d with polynomial phase function is of strong type (p,r), 1<r<p<\infty; this yields a positive answer in the 1<p<2 case to a conjecture of Stein which asserts that for 1<p<\infty we have that C_d is of strong type (p,p). A key ingredient in this proof is the further extension of the {\it relational} time-frequency perspective (introduced in \cite{q}) to the general polynomial phase.
