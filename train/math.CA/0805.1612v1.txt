Let U_{n}\subset C^{n}[ a,b]  be an extended Chebyshev space of dimension n+1. Suppose that f_{0}\in U_{n} is strictly positive and % f_{1}\in U_{n} has the property that f_{1}/f_{0} is strictly increasing. We search for conditions ensuring the existence of points % t_{0},...,t_{n}\in [ a,b]  and positive coefficients \alpha_{0},...,\alpha_{n} such that for all f\in C[ a,b], the operator B_{n}:C[ a,b] \to U_{n} defined by % B_{n}f=\sum_{k=0}^{n}f(t_{k}) \alpha_{k}p_{n,k} satisfies % B_{n}f_{0}=f_{0} and B_{n}f_{1}=f_{1}. Here it is assumed that % p_{n,k},k=0,...,n, is a Bernstein basis, defined by the property that each % p_{n,k} has a zero of order k at a and a zero of order n-k at b.
