We study the existence and shape preserving properties of a generalized Bernstein operator B_{n} fixing a strictly positive function f_{0}, and a second function f_{1} such that f_{1}/f_{0} is strictly increasing, within the framework of extended Chebyshev spaces U_{n}. The first main result gives an inductive criterion for existence: suppose there exists a Bernstein operator B_{n}:C[a,b]\to U_{n} with strictly increasing nodes, fixing f_{0}, f_{1}\in U_{n}. If U_{n}\subset U_{n + 1} and U_{n + 1} has a non-negative Bernstein basis, then there exists a Bernstein operator B_{n+1}:C[a,b]\to U_{n+1} with strictly increasing nodes, fixing f_{0} and f_{1}. In particular, if % f_{0},f_{1},...,f_{n} is a basis of U_{n} such that the linear span of % f_{0},..,f_{k} is an extended Chebyshev space over [ a,b]  for each k=0,...,n, then there exists a Bernstein operator B_{n} with increasing nodes fixing f_{0} and f_{1}. The second main result says that under the above assumptions the following inequalities hold B_{n}f\geq B_{n+1}f\geq f for all (f_{0},f_{1})-convex functions f\in C[ a,b] . Furthermore, B_{n}f is (f_{0},f_{1})-convex for all (f_{0},f_{1})% -convex functions f\in C[ a,b] . In the specific case of exponential polynomials we give alternative proofs of shape preserving properties by computing derivatives of the generalized Bernstein polynomials.
