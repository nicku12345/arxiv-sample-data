Let L be a linear differential operator with constant coefficients of order n and complex eigenvalues \lambda_{0},...,\lambda_{n}. Assume that the set U_{n} of all solutions of the equation Lf=0 is closed under complex conjugation. If the length of the interval [ a,b]  is smaller than \pi /M_{n}, where M_{n}:=\max \left\{| \text{Im}% \lambda_{j}| :j=0,...,n\right\} , then there exists a basis p_{n,k}%, k=0,...n, of the space U_{n} with the property that each p_{n,k} has a zero of order k at a and a zero of order n-k at b, and each % p_{n,k} is positive on the open interval (a,b) . Under the additional assumption that \lambda_{0} and \lambda_{1} are real and distinct, our first main result states that there exist points % a=t_{0}<t_{1}<...<t_{n}=b and positive numbers \alpha_{0},..,\alpha_{n}%, such that the operator \begin{equation*} B_{n}f:=\sum_{k=0}^{n}\alpha_{k}f(t_{k}) p_{n,k}(x) \end{equation*} satisfies B_{n}e^{\lambda_{j}x}=e^{\lambda_{j}x}, for j=0,1. The second main result gives a sufficient condition guaranteeing the uniform convergence of B_{n}f to f for each f\in C[ a,b] .
