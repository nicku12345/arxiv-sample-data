We establish some nonlinear integral inequalities for functions defined on a time scale. The results extend some previous Gronwall and Bihari type inequalities on time scales. Some examples of time scales for which our results can be applied are provided. An application to the qualitative analysis of a nonlinear dynamic equation is discussed.
