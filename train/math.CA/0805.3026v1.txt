We study Ces\`aro (C,\delta) means for two-variable Jacobi polynomials on the parabolic biangle B=\{(x_1,x_2)\in{\mathbb R}^2:0\leq x_1^2\leq x_2\leq 1\}. Using the product formula derived by Koornwinder & Schwartz for this polynomial system, the Ces\`aro operator can be interpreted as a convolution operator. We then show that the Ces\`aro (C,\delta) means of the orthogonal expansion on the biangle are uniformly bounded if \delta>\alpha+\beta+1, \alpha-\frac 12\geq\beta\geq 0. Furthermore, for \delta\geq\alpha+2\beta+\frac 32 the means define positive linear operators.
