We prove sharp L^p-L^q estimates for averaging operators along general polynomial curves in two and three dimensions. These operators are translation-invariant, given by convolution with the so-called affine arclength measure of the curve and we obtain universal bounds over the class of curves given by polynomials of bounded degree. Our method relies on a geometric inequality for general vector polynomials together with a combinatorial argument due to M. Christ. Almost sharp Lorentz space estimates are obtained as well.
