Commuting is an important property in many cases of investigation of properties of operators as well as in various applications, especially in quantum physics. Using the observation that the generalized weighted differential operator of order k and the weighted Hardy-type operator commute we derive a number of new and interesting identities involving some functions of mathematical physics.
