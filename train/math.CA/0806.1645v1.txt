We give a different and probably more elementary proof of a good part of Jean Taylor's regularity theorem for Almgren almost-minimal sets of dimension 2 in \R^3. We use this opportunity to settle some details about almost-minimal sets, extend a part of Taylor's result to almost-minimal sets of dimension 2 in \R^n, and give the expected characterization of the closed sets E of dimension 2 in \R^3 that are minimal, in the sense that H^2(E\setminus F) \leq H^2(F\setminus E) for every closed set F such that there is a bounded set B so that F=E out of B and F separates points of \R^3 \setminus B that E separates.
