We prove that if u_1,u_2 : (0,\infty) \times \R^d \to (0,\infty) are sufficiently well-behaved solutions to certain heat inequalities on \R^d then the function u: (0,\infty) \times \R^d \to (0,\infty) given by u^{1/p}=u_1^{1/p_1} * u_2^{1/p_2} also satisfies a heat inequality of a similar type provided \tfrac{1}{p_1} + \tfrac{1}{p_2} = 1 + \tfrac{1}{p}. On iterating, this result leads to an analogous statement concerning n-fold convolutions. As a corollary, we give a direct heat-flow proof of the sharp n-fold Young convolution inequality and its reverse form.
