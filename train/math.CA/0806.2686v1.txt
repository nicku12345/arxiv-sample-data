We study a variant of the majorization relation. In particular we consider inequalities involving some Schur-concave symmetric polynomials related to the multinomial expansion. We also discuss how these topics were motivated by conjectures on sharp Lp inequalities between complex exponential sums conjectured by Hardy and Littlewood (still open problems), and why the usual majorization relation does not hold in that context.
