The properties of matrix valued polynomials generated by the scalar-type Rodrigues' formulas are analyzed. A general representation of these polynomials is found in terms of products of simple differential operators. The recurrence relations, leading coefficients, completeness are established, as well as, in the commutative case, the second order equations for which these polynomials are eigenfunctions and the corresponding eigenvalues, and ladder operators.   The conjecture of Duran and Grunbaum that if the weights are self-adjoint and positive semidefinite then they are necessarily of scalar type is proved for Q(x)=x and Q(x)=x^2-1 in dimension two, and for any dimension under genericity assumptions.   Commutative classes of quasi-orthogonal polynomials are found, which satisfy all the properties usually associated to orthogonal polynomials.
