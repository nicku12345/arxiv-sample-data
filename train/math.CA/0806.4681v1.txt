We study AAK-type meromorphic approximants to functions F, where F is a sum of a rational function R and a Cauchy transform of a complex measure \lambda with compact regular support included in (-1,1), whose argument has bounded variation on the support. The approximation is understood in L^p-norm of the unit circle, p\geq2. We obtain that the counting measures of poles of the approximants converge to the Green equilibrium distribution on the support of \lambda relative to the unit disk, that the approximants themselves converge in capacity to F, and that the poles of R attract at least as many poles of the approximants as their multiplicity and not much more.
