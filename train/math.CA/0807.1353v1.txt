The q-classical orthogonal polynomials of the q-Hahn Tableau are characterized from their orthogonality condition and by a first and a second structure relation. Unfortunately, for the q-semiclassical orthogonal polynomials (a generalization of the classical ones) we find only in the literature the first structure relation. In this paper, a second structure relation is deduced. In particular, by means of a general finite-type relation between a q-semiclassical polynomial sequence and the sequence of its q-differences such a structure relation is obtained.
