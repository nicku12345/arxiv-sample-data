In the present paper the authors show that an iteration of the \mathscr{L}_{2}-transform by itself is a constant multiple of the Glasser transform. Using this iteration identity, a Parseval-Goldstein type theorem for \mathscr{L}_{2}-transform and the Glasser transform is given. By making use of these results a number of new Parseval-Goldstein type identities are obtained for these and many other well-known integral transforms. The identities proven in this paper are shown to give rise to useful corollaries for evaluating infinite integrals of special functions. Some examples are also given as illustration of the results presented here.
