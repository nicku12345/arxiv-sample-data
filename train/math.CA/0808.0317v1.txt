In the present paper the authors consider the \mathcal{P}_{\nu,2}-transform as a generalization of the Widder potential transform and the Glasser transform. The \mathcal{P}_{\nu,2}-transform is obtained as an iteration of the the \mathcal{L}_{2}-transform with itself. Many identities involving these transforms are given. By making use of these identities, a number of new Parseval-Goldstein type identities are obtained for these and many other well-known integral transforms. The identities proven in this paper are shown to give rise to useful corollaries for evaluating infinite integrals of special functions. Some examples are also given as illustration of the results presented here.
