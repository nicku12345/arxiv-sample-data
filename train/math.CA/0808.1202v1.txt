The Fekete points are the points that maximize a Vandermonde-type determinant that appears in the polynomial Lagrange interpolation formula. They are well suited points for interpolation formulas and numerical integration. We prove the asymptotic equidistribution of the Fekete points in the sphere. The way we proceed is by showing their connection with other array of points, the Marcinkiewicz-Zygmund arrays and the interpolating arrays, that have been studied recently.
