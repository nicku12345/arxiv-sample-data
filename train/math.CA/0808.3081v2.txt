In this paper, we extend the result of Kitaev and Korotkin to the case where a monodromy-preserving deformation has an irregular singularity. For the monodromy-preserving deformation, we obtain the \tau-function whose deformation parameters are the positions of regular singularities and the parameter t of an irregular singularity. Furthermore, the \tau-function is expressed by the hyperelliptic \Theta function moving the argument \z and the period \B, where t and the positions of regular singularities move z and \B, respectively.
