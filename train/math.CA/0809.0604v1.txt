Inspired by work of Montgomery on Fourier series and Donoho-Strak in signal processing, we investigate two families of rearrangement inequalities for the Fourier transform. More precisely, we show that the L^2 behavior of a Fourier transform of a function over a small set is controlled by the L^2 behavior of the Fourier transform of its symmetric decreasing rearrangement. In the L^1 case, the same is true if we further assume that the function has a support of finite measure. As a byproduct, we also give a simple proof and an extension of a result of Lieb about the smoothness of a rearrangement. Finally, a straightforward application to solutions of the free Shr\"odinger equation is given.
