We construct a uniformly discrete, and even sparse, sequence of real numbers \Lambda=\{\lambda_n\} and a function g in L^2(R), such that for every q>2, every function f in L^2(R) can be approximated with arbitrary small error by a linear combination \sum c_n g(t-\lambda_n) with an l_q estimate of the coefficients: \|\{c_n\}\|_{l_q}\leq C(q)\|f\|. This can not be done for q=2, according to [2].
