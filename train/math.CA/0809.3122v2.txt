In a recent paper we introduced a multivariable generalisation of the Bessel polynomials, depending on one extra parameter, and related to the so-called hyperbolic Sutherland model with external Morse potential. In this paper we obtain a corresponding multivariable generalisation of a well-known orthogonality relation for the (one-variable) Bessel polynomials due to Krall and Frink.
