We study the regularity of the bilinear maximal operator when applied to Sobolev functions, proving that it maps W^{1,p}(\mathbb{R}) \times W^{1,q}(\mathbb{R}) \to W^{1,r}(\mathbb{R}) with 1 <p,q < \infty and r\geq 1, boundedly and continuously. The same result holds on \mathbb{R}^n when r>1. We also investigate the almost everywhere and weak convergence under the action of the classical Hardy-Littlewood maximal operator, both in its global and local versions.
