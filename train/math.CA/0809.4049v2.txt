We obtain optimal trigonometric polynomials of a given degree N that majorize, minorize and approximate in L^1(\mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}) the Bernoulli periodic functions. These are the periodic analogues of two works of F. Littmann that generalize a paper of J. Vaaler. As applications we provide the corresponding Erd\"{o}s-Tur\'{a}n-type inequalities, approximations to other periodic functions and bounds for certain Hermitian forms.
