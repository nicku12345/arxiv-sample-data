Various Schlesinger transformations can be combined with a direct pull-back of a hypergeometric 2x2 system to obtain RS^2_4-pullback transformations to isomonodromic 2x2 Fuchsian systems with 4 singularities. The corresponding Painleve VI solutions are algebraic functions, possibly in different orbits under Okamoto transformations. This paper demonstrates a direct computation of Schlesinger transformations acting on several apparent singular points, and presents an algebraic procedure (via syzygies) of computing algebraic Painleve VI solutions without deriving full RS-pullback transformations.
