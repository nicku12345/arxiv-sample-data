A generalization of the definition of a one-dimensional improper integral with a finite limit is presented. The new definition extends the range of valid integrals to include integrals which were previously considered to not be integrable. This definition is shown to be equivalent to the infinite limit definition presented in "Generalized improper integral definition for infinite limit" (arXiv:0805.3559) via a particular change of variable of integration. The definition preserves linearity and uniqueness. Integrals which are valid under the conventional definition have the same value under the new definition. Criteria for interchanging the order of integration and differentiation, and for interchanging the order with a second integration, are obtained. Examples are provided.
