We look at a measure, \lambda^\infty, on the infinite-dimensional space, {\mathbb R}^\infty, for which we attempt to put forth an analogue of the Lebesgue density theorem. Although this measure allows us to find partial results, for example for continuous functions, we prove that it is impossible to give an analogous theorem in full generality. In particular, we proved that the Lebesgue density of probability density functions on {\mathbb R}^\infty is zero almost everywhere.
