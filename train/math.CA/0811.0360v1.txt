The logarithm function and the exponential function are, by nature, base dependent. Thus, in this paper I introduces an arbitrary base in the logarithm and exponential functions, both dependent on q, in order to have \log_a(x;q) and a_q^x. Some of the properties of these functions had been analyzed. The logarithm function was applied to the entropy which resulted in the S_q = k[1 - \sum_{i = 1}^Wp_i^{q}]/[1 - e^{1 - q}] expression.
