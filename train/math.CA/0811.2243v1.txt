We analyze the sequence of polynomials defined by the differential-difference equation P_{n+1}(x)=P_{n}^{\prime}(x)+x(n+1)P_{n}(x) asymptotically as n\to\infty. The polynomials P_{n}(x) arise in the computation of higher derivatives of the inverse error function \operatorname{inverf}(x). We use singularity analysis and discrete versions of the WKB and ray methods and give numerical results showing the accuracy of our formulas.
