Using the steepest descent method of Deift-Zhou, we derive locally uniform asymptotic formulas for the Meixner polynomials. These include an asymptotic formula in a neighborhood of the origin, a result which as far as we are aware has not yet been obtained previously. This particular formula involves a special function, which is the uniformly bounded solution to a scalar Riemann-Hilbert problem, and which is asymptotically (as the polynomial degree n tends to infinity) equal to the constant "1" except at the origin. Numerical computation by using our formulas, and comparison with earlier results, are also given.
