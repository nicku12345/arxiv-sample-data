In this article, we define the spherical \pi-operator over domains in the (n-1)-D unit sphere S^n of R^n and develop new and analogous results on the operator it self and its mapping properties. We introduce the spherical Dirac operator \Gamma_\alpha as an \alpha- shift of of \Gamma_omega, where \Gamma_omega is the negative of the wedge (or Grassmann) product of \omega with that of the Dirac operator D_\omega. A gegenbauer polynomial is used as a Cauchy kernel for the spherical Dirac operator \Gamma_alpha.
