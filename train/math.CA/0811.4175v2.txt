The purpose of this article is to provide new error estimates for a popular type of SBF approximation on the sphere: approximating by linear combinations of Green's functions of polyharmonic differential operators. We show that the L_p approximation order for this kind of approximation is \sigma for functions having L_p smoothness \sigma (for \sigma up to the order of the underlying differential operator, just as in univariate spline theory). This is an improvement over previous error estimates, which penalized the approximation order when measuring error in L_p, p>2 and held only in a restrictive setting when measuring error in L_p, p<2.
