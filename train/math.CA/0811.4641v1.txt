The paper classifies algebraic transformations of Gauss hypergeometric functions with the local exponent differences (1/2,1/4,1/4), (1/2,1/3,1/6) and (1/3,1/3,1/3). These form a special class of algebraic transformations of Gauss hypergeometric functions, of arbitrary high degree. The Gauss hypergeometric functions can be identified as elliptic integrals on the genus 1 curves y=x^3-x or y=x^3-1. Especially interesting are algebraic transformations of the hypergeometric functions into themselves; these transformations come from isogenies of the respective elliptic curves.
