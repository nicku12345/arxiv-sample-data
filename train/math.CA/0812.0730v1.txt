We study interlacing properties of the zeros of two types of linear combinations of Laguerre polynomials with different parameters, namely R_n=L_n^{\alpha}+aL_{n}^{\alpha'} and S_n=L_n^{\alpha}+bL_{n-1}^{\alpha'}. Proofs and numerical counterexamples are given in situations where the zeros of R_n, and S_n, respectively, interlace (or do not in general) with the zeros of L_k^{\alpha}, L_k^{\alpha'}, k=n or n-1. The results we prove hold for continuous, as well as integral, shifts of the parameter \alpha.
