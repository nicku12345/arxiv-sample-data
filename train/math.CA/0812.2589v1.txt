In the combinatorial method proving of L^p-improving estimates for averages along curves pioneered by Christ (IMRN, 1998), it is desirable to estimate the average modulus (with respect to some uniform measure on a set) of a polynomial-like function from below using only the value of the function or its derivatives at some prescribed point. In this paper, it is shown that there is always a relatively large set of points (independent of the particular function to be integrated) for which such estimates are possible. Inequalities of this type are then applied to extend the results of Tao and Wright (JAMS, 2003) to obtain endpoint restricted weak-type estimates for averages over curves given by polynomials.
