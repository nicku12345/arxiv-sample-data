We consider the Dunkl intertwining operator V_\alpha and its dual {}^tV_\alpha, we define and study the Dunkl Sonine operator and its dual on \mathbb{R}. Next, we introduce complex powers of the Dunkl Laplacian \Delta_\alpha and establish inversion formulas for the Dunkl Sonine operator S_{\alpha,\beta} and its dual {}^tS_{\alpha,\beta}. Also, we give a Plancherel formula for the operator {}^tS_{\alpha,\beta}.
