Let f be a measurable, real function defined in a neighbourhood of infinity. The function f is said to be of generalised regular variation if there exist functions h \not\equiv 0 and g > 0 such that f(xt) - f(t) = h(x) g(t) + o(g(t)) as t \to \infty for all x \in (0, \infty). Zooming in on the remainder term o(g(t)) leads eventually to a relation of the form f(xt) - f(t) = h_1(x) g_1(t) + ... + h_n(x) g_n(t) + o(g_n(t)), each g_i being of smaller order than its predecessor g_{i-1}. The function f is said to be generalised regularly varying of order n with rate vector \g = (g_1, >..., g_n)'. Under general assumptions, \g itself must be regularly varying in the sense that \g(xt) = x^{\B} \g(t) + o(g_n(t)) for some upper triangular matrix \B \in \RR^{n \times n}, and the vector of limit functions \h = (h_1, >..., h_n) is of the form \h(x) = \c \int_1^x u^\B u^{-1} \du for some row vector \c \in \RR^{1 \times n}. The usual results in the theory of regular variation such as uniform convergence and Potter bounds continue to hold. An interesting special case arises when all the rate functions g_i are slowly varying, yielding \Pi-variation of order n, the canonical case being that \B is equivalent to a single Jordan block with zero diagonal. The theory is applied to a long list of special functions.
