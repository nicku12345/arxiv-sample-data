Orthogonality of the Jacobi and of Laguerre polynomials, P_n^(a,b) and L_n^(a), is established for a,b complex (a,b not negative integers and a+b different from -2,-3,...) using the Hadamard finite part of the integral which gives their orthogonality in the classical cases. Riemann-Hilbert problems that these polynomials satisfy are found.   The results are formally similar to the ones in the classical case (when the real parts of a,b are greater than -1)
