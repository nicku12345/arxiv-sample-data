We give weighted norm inequalities for the maximal fractional operator  \mathcal M_{q,\beta} of Hardy-Littlewood and the fractional integral I_{\gamma}. These inequalities are established between (L^{q},L^{p}) ^{\alpha}(X,d,\mu) spaces (which are super spaces of Lebesgue spaces L^{\alpha}(X,d,\mu), and subspaces of amalgams (L^{q},L^{p})(X,d,\mu)) and in the setting of space of homogeneous type (X,d,\mu). The conditions on the weights are stated in terms of Orlicz norm.
