A recurrence relation for the Li/Keiper constants in terms of the Stieltjes constants is derived in this paper. In addition, we also report a formula for the Stieltjes constants in terms of the higher derivatives of the Riemann zeta function. A formula for the Stieltjes constants in terms of the (exponential) complete Bell polynomials containing the eta constants as the arguments is also derived.
