We study differential equations F(y,...,y^{(n)})=0 where F(Y_0,...,Y_n) is a formal series in Y_0,...,Y_n with coefficients in some field of \emph{generalized power series} \mathds{K}_r with finite rank r\in\mathbb{N}^*. Our purpose is to understand the connection between the set of exponents of the coefficients of the equation \textrm{Supp} F and the set \textrm{Supp} y_0 of exponents of the elements y_0\in\mathds{K}_r that are solutions.
