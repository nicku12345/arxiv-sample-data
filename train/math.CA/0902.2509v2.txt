Let \Omega_n stand for the volume of the unit ball in \mathbb{R}^n for n\in\mathbb{N}. In the present paper, we prove that the sequence \Omega_{n}^{1/(n\ln n)} is logarithmically convex and that the sequence \frac{\Omega_{n}^{1/(n\ln n)}}{\Omega_{n+1}^{1/[(n+1)\ln(n+1)]}} is strictly decreasing for n\ge2. In addition, some monotonic and concave properties of several functions relating to \Omega_{n} are extended and generalized.
