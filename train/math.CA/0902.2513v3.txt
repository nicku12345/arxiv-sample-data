In this paper, we prove that for x+y>0 and y+1>0 the inequality {equation*} \frac{[\Gamma(x+y+1)/\Gamma(y+1)]^{1/x}}{[\Gamma(x+y+2)/\Gamma(y+1)]^{1/(x+1)}} <\biggl(\frac{x+y}{x+y+1}\biggr)^{1/2} {equation*} is valid if x>1 and reversed if x<1 and that the power \frac12 is the best possible, where \Gamma(x) is the Euler gamma function. This extends the result in [Y. Yu, \textit{An inequality for ratios of gamma functions}, J. Math. Anal. Appl. \textbf{352} (2009), no.~2, 967\nobreakdash--970.] and resolves an open problem posed in [B.-N. Guo and F. Qi, \emph{Inequalities and monotonicity for the ratio of gamma functions}, Taiwanese J. Math. \textbf{7} (2003), no.~2, 239\nobreakdash--247.].
