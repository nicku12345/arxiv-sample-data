We find sufficient conditions for log-convexity and log-concavity for the functions of the forms a\mapsto\sum{f_k}(a)_kx^k, a\mapsto\sum{f_k}\Gamma(a+k)x^k and a\mapsto\sum{f_k}x^k/(a)_k. The most useful examples of such functions are generalized hypergeometric functions. In particular, we generalize the Tur\'{a}n inequality for the confluent hypergeometric function recently proved by Barnard, Gordy and Richards and log-convexity results for the same function recently proved by Baricz. Besides, we establish a reverse inequality which complements naturally the inequality of Barnard, Gordy and Richards. Similar results are established for the Gauss and the generalized hypergeometric functions. A conjecture about monotonicity of a quotient of products of confluent hypergeometric functions is made.
