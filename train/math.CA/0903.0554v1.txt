A nonlinear inequality is formulated in the paper. An estimate of the rate of decay of solutions to this inequality is obtained. This inequality is of interest in a study of dynamical systems and nonlinear evolution equations. It can be applied to the study of global existence of solutions to nonlinear PDE.
