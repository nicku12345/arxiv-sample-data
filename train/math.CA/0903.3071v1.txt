In the present paper, necessary and sufficient conditions are established for a function involving divided differences of the digamma and trigamma functions to be completely monotonic. Consequently, necessary and sufficient conditions are derived for a function involving the ratio of two gamma functions to be logarithmically completely monotonic, and some double inequalities are deduced for bounding divided differences of polygamma functions.
