In the article, a notion "logarithmically absolutely monotonic function" is introduced, an inclusion that a logarithmically absolutely monotonic function is also absolutely monotonic is revealed, the logarithmically complete monotonicity and the logarithmically absolute monotonicity of the function \bigl(1+\frac{\alpha}x\bigr) ^{x+\beta} are proved, where \alpha and \beta are given real parameters, a new proof for the inclusion that a logarithmically completely monotonic function is also completely monotonic is given, and an open problem is posed.
