In this article, logarithmically complete monotonicity properties of some functions such as \frac1{[\Gamma(x+1)]^{1/x}}, \frac{[{\Gamma(x+\alpha+1)}]^{1/(x+\alpha)}}{[{\Gamma(x+1)}]^{1/x}}, \frac{[\Gamma(x+1)]^{1/x}}{(x+1)^\alpha} and \frac{[\Gamma(x+1)]^{1/x}}{x^\alpha} defined in (-1,\infty) or (0,\infty) for given real number \alpha\in\tr are obtained, some known results are recovered, extended and generalized. Moreover, some basic properties of the logarithmically completely monotonic functions are established.
