We present an explicit expression for the q-difference system, which the BC_1-type Jackson integral (q-series) satisfies, as first order simultaneous q-difference equations with a concrete basis. As an application, we give a simple proof for the hypergeometric summation formula introduced by Gustafson and the product formula of the q-integral introduced by Nassrallah-Rahman and Gustafson.
