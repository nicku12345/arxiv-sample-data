In this expository and survey paper, along one of main lines of bounding the ratio of two gamma functions, we look back and analyse some inequalities, several complete monotonicity of functions involving ratios of two gamma or q-gamma functions, and necessary and sufficient conditions for functions involving ratios of two gamma or q-gamma functions to be logarithmically completely monotonic.
