For m,n\in\mathbb{N}, let f_{m,n}(x)=\bigr[\psi^{(m)}(x)\bigl]^2+\psi^{(n)}(x) on (0,\infty). In the present paper, we prove using two methods that, among all f_{m,n}(x) for m,n\in\mathbb{N}, only f_{1,2}(x) is nontrivially completely monotonic on (0,\infty). Accurately, the functions f_{1,2}(x) and f_{m,2n-1}(x) are completely monotonic on (0,\infty), but the functions f_{m,2n}(x) for (m,n)\ne(1,1) are not monotonic and does not keep the same sign on (0,\infty).
