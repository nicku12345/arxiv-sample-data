In this article, a necessary and sufficient condition and a necessary condition are established for a function involving the gamma function to be logarithmically completely monotonic on (0,\infty). As applications of the necessary and sufficient condition, some inequalities for bounding the psi and polygamma functions and the ratio of two gamma functions are derived.
