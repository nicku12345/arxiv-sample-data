We study the moment space corresponding to matrix measures on the unit circle. Moment points are characterized by non-negative definiteness of block Toeplitz matrices. This characterization is used to derive an explicit representation of orthogonal polynomials with respect to matrix measures on the unit circle and to present a geometric definition of canonical moments. It is demonstrated that these geometrically defined quantities coincide with the Verblunsky coefficients, which appear in the Szeg\"{o} recursions for the matrix orthogonal polynomials. Finally, we provide an alternative proof of the Geronimus relations which is based on a simple relation between canonical moments of matrix measures on the interval [-1,1] and the Verblunsky coefficients corresponding to matrix measures on the unit circle.
