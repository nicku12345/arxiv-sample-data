We prove that the roots of a definable C^\infty curve of monic hyperbolic polynomials admit a definable C^\infty parameterization, where `definable' refers to any fixed o-minimal structure on (\mathbb R,+,\cdot). Moreover, we provide sufficient conditions, in terms of the differentiability of the coefficients and the order of contact of the roots, for the existence of C^p (for p \in \mathbb N) arrangements of the roots in both the definable and the non-definable case. These conditions are sharp in the definable and under an additional assumption also in the non-definable case. In particular, we obtain a simple proof of Bronshtein's theorem in the definable setting. We prove that the roots of definable C^\infty curves of complex polynomials can be desingularized by means of local power substitutions t \mapsto \pm t^N. For a definable continuous curve of complex polynomials we show that any continuous choice of roots is actually locally absolutely continuous.
