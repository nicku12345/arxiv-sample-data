We consider an ordinary nonlinear differential equation with generalized coefficients as an equation in differentials in algebra of new generalized functions. Then the solution of such equation will be a new generalized function. In the article we formulate necessary and sufficient conditions when the solution of the given equation in algebra of new generalized functions is associated with an ordinary function. Moreover the class of all possible associated functions was described.
