Let \gamma: [0,1] \to [0,1]^2 be a continuous curve such that \gamma(0)=(0,0), \gamma(1)=(1,1), and \gamma(t) \in (0,1)^2 for all t\in (0,1). We prove that, for each n \in \mathbb{N}, there exists a sequence of points A_i, 0\leq i \leq n+1, on \gamma such that A_0=(0,0), A_{n+1}=(1,1), and the sequences \pi_1(\overrightarrow{A_iA_{i+1}}) and \pi_2(\overrightarrow{A_iA_{i+1}}), 0\leq i \leq n, are positive and the same up to order, where \pi_1,\pi_2 are projections on the axes.
