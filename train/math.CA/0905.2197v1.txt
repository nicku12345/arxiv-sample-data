Let A be a compact set in \Rp of Hausdorff dimension d. For s\in(0,d), the Riesz s-equilibrium measure \mu^{s,A} is the unique Borel probability measure with support in A that minimizes  \Is(\mu):=\iint\Rk{x}{y}{s}d\mu(y)d\mu(x) over all such probability measures. In this paper we show that if A is a strictly self-similar d-fractal, then \mu^{s,A} converges in the weak-star topology to normalized d-dimensional Hausdorff measure restricted to A as s approaches d from below.
