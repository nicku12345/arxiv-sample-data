In this article we extend the theory of shift-invariant spaces to the context of LCA groups. We introduce the notion of H-invariant space for a countable discrete subgroup H of an LCA group G, and show that the concept of range function and the techniques of fiberization are valid in this context. As a consequence of this generalization we prove characterizations of frames and Riesz bases of these spaces extending previous results, that were known for Rd and the lattice Zd .
