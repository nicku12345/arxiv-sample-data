Aim of this paper is a finer analysis of the group of flat chains with coefficients in Z_p introduced in a recent paper by Ambrosio-Katz, by taking quotients of the group of integer rectifiable currents, along the lines of the the Ziemer and Federer approach. We investigate the typical questions of the theory of currents, namely rectifiability of the measure-theoretic support and boundary rectifiability. Our main result can also be interpreted as a closure theorem for the class of integer rectifiable currents with respect to a (much) weaker convergence, induced by flat distance mod p, and with respect to weaker mass bounds. A crucial tool in many proofs is the isoperimetric inequality proved by Ambrosio-Katz with universal constants.
