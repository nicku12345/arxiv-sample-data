A locally integrable function m(\xi,\eta) defined on \mathbb R^n\times \mathbb R^n is said to be a bilinear multiplier on \mathbb R^n of type (p_1,p_2, p_3) if  B_m(f,g)(x)=\int_{\mathbb R^n} \int_{\mathbb R^n}\hat f(\xi)\hat g(\eta)m(\xi,\eta)e^{2\pi i(<\xi +\eta,x>} d\xi d\eta defines a bounded bilinear operator from L^{p_1}(\mathbb R^n)\times L^{p_2}(\mathbb R^n)  to L^{p_3}(\mathbb R^n). The study of the basic properties of such spaces is investigated and several methods of constructing examples of bilinear multipliers are provided. The special case where m(\xi,\eta)= M(\xi-\eta) for a given M defined on \mathbb R^n is also addressed.
