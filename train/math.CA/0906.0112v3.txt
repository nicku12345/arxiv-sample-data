We study maximal averages associated with singular measures on \rr. Our main result is a construction of singular Cantor-type measures supported on sets of Hausdorff dimension 1 - \epsilon, 0 \leq \epsilon < {1/3} for which the corresponding maximal operators are bounded on L^p(\mathbb R) for p > (1 + \epsilon)/(1 - \epsilon). As a consequence, we are able to answer a question of Aversa and Preiss on density and differentiation theorems in one dimension. Our proof combines probabilistic techniques with the methods developed in multidimensional Euclidean harmonic analysis, in particular there are strong similarities to Bourgain's proof of the circular maximal theorem in two dimensions.   Updates: Andreas Seeger has provided an argument to the effect that our global maximal operators are in fact bounded on L^p(R) for all p>1; in particular, it follows that our differentiation theorems are also valid for all p>1. Furthermore, David Preiss has proved that no such differentiation theorems (let alone maximal estimates) can hold with p=1. These arguments are included in the new version. We have also improved the exposition in a number of places.
