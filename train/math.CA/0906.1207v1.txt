Let G be an LCA group and K a closed subgroup of G. A closed subspace of L^2(G) is called K-invariant if it is invariant under translations by elements of K.   Assume now that H is a countable uniform lattice in G and M is any closed subgroup of G containing H. In this article we study necessary and sufficient conditions for an H-invariant space to be M-invariant.   As a consequence of our results we prove that for each closed subgroup M of G containing the lattice H, there exists an H-invariant space S that is exactly M-invariant. That is, S is not invariant under any other subgroup M' containing M. We also obtain estimates on the support of the Fourier transform of the generators of the H-invariant space, related to its M-invariance.
