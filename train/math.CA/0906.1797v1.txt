For a small disk D centered at the origin in R^2, a smooth real-valued function S(x,y) on D, and a positive epsilon, we consider the measure of the points in D where |S(x,y)| < epsilon, as well as oscillatory integral analogues. Specifically, we consider the effect of perturbing S(x,y) on these quantities. Besides being of intrinsic interest, these questions are important in the analysis of Fourier transforms of surface-supported measures. Complex and higher-dimensional analogues of these questions are also connected to various issues in algebraic and complex geometry. For real-analytic S(x,y), this question has been investigated for example by Karpushkin, using versal deformation theory, and by Phong-Stein-Sturm, who developed a method often referred to as the method of algebraic estimates.   In this paper, we show how the use of resolution of singularities algorithms in two dimensions, along with some one-dimensional Van der Corput-type lemmas, provides another method for dealing with such questions. As a result, we prove new estimates and theorems for these and related quantities. Furthermore, since these algorithms apply to all smooth functions, the theorems will hold for all smooth functions as opposed to the earlier real-analytic results.
