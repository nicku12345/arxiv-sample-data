We investigate the quadratic decomposition and duality to classify symmetrical H_{q}-semiclassical orthogonal q-polynomials of class one where H_{q} is the Hahn's operator. For any canonical situation, the recurrence coefficients, the q-analog of the distributional equation of Pearson type, the moments and integral or discrete representations are given.
