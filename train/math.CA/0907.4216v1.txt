We provide sufficient normal curvature conditions on the boundary of a domain D \subset \BBR^4 to guarantee unboundedness of the bilinear Fourier multiplier operator \T_D with symbol \chi_D outside the local L^2 setting, \textit{i.e}. from L^{p_1} (\BBR^2) \times L^{p_2} (\BBR^2) \to L^{p_3'} (\BBR^2) with \sum \frac{1}{p_j} = 1 and p_j <2 for some j. In particular, these curvature conditions are satisfied by any domain D that is locally strictly convex at a single boundary point.
