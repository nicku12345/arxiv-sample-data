A new modulus of smoothness based on the Euler angles is introduced on the unit sphere and is shown to satisfy all the usual characteristic properties of moduli of smoothness, including direct and inverse theorem for the best approximation by polynomials and its equivalence to a K-functional, defined via partial derivatives in Euler angles. The set of results on the moduli on the sphere serves as a basis for defining new moduli of smoothness and their corresponding K-functionals on the unit ball, which are used to characterize the best approximation by polynomials on the ball.
