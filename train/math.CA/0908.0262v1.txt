Considering functions  f  on  \R^n  for which both  f  and  \hat{f}  are bounded by the Gaussian  e^{-{1/2}a|x|^2}, 0 < a < 1  we show that their Fourier-Hermite coefficients have exponential decay. Optimal decay is obtained for  O(n)-finite functions thus extending the one dimensional result of Vemuri.
