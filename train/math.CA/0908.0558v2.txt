We study the Hankel determinant of the generalized Jacobi weight (x-t)^{\gamma}x^\alpha(1-x)^\beta for x\in[0,1] with \alpha, \beta>0, t < 0  and \gamma\in\mathbb{R}. Based on the ladder operators for the corresponding monic orthogonal polynomials P_n(x), it is shown that the logarithmic derivative of Hankel determinant is characterized by a \tau-function for the Painlev\'e VI system.
