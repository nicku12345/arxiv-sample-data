As shown in [A1], the lowest constants appearing in the weak type (1,1) inequalities satisfied by the centered Hardy-Littlewood maximal operator associated to certain finite radial measures, grow exponentially fast with the dimension. Here we extend this result to a wider class of radial measures and to some values of p>1. Furthermore, we improve the previously known bounds for p=1. Roughly speaking, whenever p\in (1, 1.03], if \mu is defined by a radial, radially decreasing density satisfying some mild growth conditions, then the best constants c_{p,d,\mu} in the weak type (p,p) inequalities satisfy c_{p,d,\mu} \ge 1.005^d for all d sufficiently large. We also show that exponential increase of the best constants occurs for certain families of doubling measures, and for arbitrarily high values of p.   [A1] Aldaz, J.M.
