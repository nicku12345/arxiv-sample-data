In Baraka's paper [2], he obtained the Littlewood-Paley characterization of Campanato spaces L^{2,\lambda} and introduced \mathcal {L}^{p,\lambda,s} spaces. He showed that \mathcal {L}^{2,\lambda,s}=(-\triangle)^{-\frac{s}{2}}L^{2,\lambda} for 0\leq\lambda<n+2. In [7], by using the properties of fractional Carleson measures, J Xiao proved that for n\geq2, 0<\alpha<1. (-\triangle)^{-\frac{\alpha}{2}}L^{2,n-2\alpha} is essential the Q_{\alpha}(\mathbb{R}^n) spaces which were introduced in [4]. Then we could conclude that Q_{\alpha}(\mathbb{R}^n)=\mathcal {L}^{2,n-2\alpha,\alpha} for 0<\alpha<1. In fact, this result could be also obtained directly by using the method in [2]. In this paper, We proved this result in the spirit of [2]. This paper could be considered as the supplement of Baraka's work [2].
