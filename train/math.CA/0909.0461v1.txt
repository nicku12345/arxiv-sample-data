For all n large enough, we show uniqueness of a critical point in best rational approximation of degree n, in the L^2-sense on the unit circle, to functions f, where f is a sum of a Cauchy transform of a complex measure \mu supported on a real interval included in (-1,1), whose Radon-Nikodym derivative with respect to the arcsine distribution on its support is Dini-continuous, non-vanishing and with and argument of bounded variation, and of a rational function with no poles on the support of \mu.
