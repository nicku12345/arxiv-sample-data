Let \{P_n \}_{n\ge0} be a sequence of monic orthogonal polynomials with respect to a quasi--definite linear functional u and \{Q_n \}_{n\ge0} a sequence of polynomials defined by Q_n(x)=P_n(x)+s_n P_{n-1}(x)+t_n P_{n-2}(x),\quad n\ge1, with t_n \not= 0 for n\ge2.   We obtain a new characterization of the orthogonality of the sequence \{Q_n \}_{n\ge0} with respect to a linear functional v, in terms of the coefficients of a quadratic polynomial h such that h(x)v= u.   We also study some cases in which the parameters s_n and t_n can be computed more easily, and give several examples.   Finally, the interpretation of such a perturbation in terms of the Jacobi matrices associated with \{P_n \}_{n\ge0} and \{Q_n \}_{n\ge0} is presented.
