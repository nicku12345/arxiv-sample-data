Iterated Bernstein polynomial approximations of degree n for continuous function which also use the values of the function at i/n, i=0,1,...,n, are proposed. The rate of convergence of the classic Bernstein polynomial approximations is significantly improved by the iterated Bernstein polynomial approximations without increasing the degree of the polynomials. The close form expression of the limiting iterated Bernstein polynomial approximation of degree n when the number of the iterations approaches infinity is obtained. The same idea applies to the q-Bernstein polynomials and the Szasz-Mirakyan approximation. The application to numerical integral approximations is also discussed.
