Asymptotic expansions are given for large values of n of the generalized Bernoulli polynomials B_n^\mu(z) and Euler polynomials E_n^\mu(z). In a previous paper L\'opez and Temme (1999) these polynomials have been considered for large values of \mu, with n fixed. In the literature no complete description of the large n asymptotics of the considered polynomials is available. We give the general expansions, summarize known results of special cases and give more details about these results. We use two-point Taylor expansions for obtaining new type of expansions. The analysis is based on contour integrals that follow from the generating functions of the polynomials.
