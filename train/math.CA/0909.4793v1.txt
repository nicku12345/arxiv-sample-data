In this article we give a new transformation between elliptic hypergeometric beta integrals, which gives rise to a Weyl group symmetry of type F_4. The transformation is a generalization of a series transformation discovered by Langer, Schlosser, and Warnaar. Moreover we consider various limits of this transformation to basic hypergeometric functions obtained by letting p tend to 0.
