We explore a function L(\vec{x})=L(a,b,c,d;e;f,g) which is a linear combination of two Saalsch\"utzian {}_4F_3(1) hypergeometric series. We demonstrate a fundamental two-term relation satisfied by the L function and show that the fundamental two-term relation implies that the Coxeter group W(D_5), which has 1920 elements, is an invariance group for L(\vec{x}). The invariance relations for L(\vec{x}) are classified into six types based on a double coset decomposition of the invariance group. The fundamental two-term relation is shown to generalize classical results about hypergeometric series. We derive Thomae's identity for {}_3F_2(1) series, Bailey's identity for terminating Saalsch\"utzian {}_4F_3(1) series, and Barnes' second lemma as consequences of the fundamental two-term relation.
