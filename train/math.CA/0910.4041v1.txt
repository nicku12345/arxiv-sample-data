A high order linear q-difference equation with polynomial coefficients having q-Hahn multiple orthogonal polynomials as eigenfunctions is given. The order of the equation is related to the number of orthogonality conditions that these polynomials satisfy. Some limiting situations when q\to1 are studied. Indeed, the difference equation for Hahn multiple orthogonal polynomials given in \cite{Lee} is corrected and obtained as a limiting case.
