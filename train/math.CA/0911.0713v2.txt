As a corollary to our main result we deduce sharp A_p inequalities for T being either the Hilbert transform in dimension d=1, the Beurling transform in dimension d=2, or a Riesz transform in any dimension d\ge 2. For T_{\ast} the maximal truncations of these operators, we prove the sharp A_p weighted weak and strong-type L ^{p} (w) inequalities, for all 1<p<\infty. Key elements of the proof are (1) extrapolation (2) a recent argument for the A_2 bound in the untruncated case, an argument of Lacey-Petermichl-Reguera. (3) a weak-L^1 estimate for duals of maximal truncations. And (4) recent characterizations of the two-weight inequalities for strong and weak type inequalities, due to Lacey-Sawyer-Uriate-Tuero.
