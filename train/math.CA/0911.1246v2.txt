t is proved in this paper that there is a fine correlation between the values of |\zeta(1/2+i\varphi(t)/2)|^4 and |\zeta(1/2+it)|^2 which correspond to two segments with gigantic distance each from other. This new asymptotic formula cannot be obtained in known theories of Balasubramanian, Heath-Brown and Ivic.
