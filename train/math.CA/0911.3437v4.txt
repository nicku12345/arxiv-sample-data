We characterize two weight inequalities for general positive dyadic operators. We consider both weak and strong type inequalities, and general (p,q) mapping properties. Special cases include Sawyers Fractional Integral operator results from 1988, and the bilinear embedding inequality of Nazarov-Treil-Volberg from 1999. The method of proof is an extension of Sawyer's argument.
