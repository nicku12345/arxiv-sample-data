In a recent paper, Adamchik [V.S. Adamchik, On the Hurwitz function for rational arguments, Appl. Math. Comp. 187 (2007) 3--12] expressed in a closed form symbolic derivatives of four functions belonging to the class of functions whose derivatives are polynomials in terms of the same functions. In this sequel, simple closed-form higher derivative formulae which involve the Carlitz-Scoville higher order tangent and secant numbers are derived for eight trigonometric and hyperbolic functions.
