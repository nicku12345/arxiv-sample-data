We consider L^p two weight inequalities for maximal truncations of dyadic Calderon-Zygmund operators. In the case of one weight being doubling, a characterization is given, and for the general case, sufficient conditions are given, including standard and non-standard testing conditions. The arguments of this paper parallel the authors prior work arXiv:0805.4711, but in this paper are much easier.
