In this article we prove a new elliptic hypergeometric integral identity. It previously appeared (as a conjecture) in articles by Rains, and Spiridonov and Vartanov. Moreover it gives a different proof of an identity in another article by Rains. We also give some basic hypergeometric and classical limits of this identity. The classical limit gives identities (some known, some new) between generalizations of the Selberg integral.
