Aim of the paper is to provide a method to analyze the behavior of T-periodic solutions x_\eps, \eps>0, of a perturbed planar Hamiltonian system near a cycle x_0, of smallest period T, of the unperturbed system. The perturbation is represented by a T-periodic multivalued map which vanishes as \eps\to0. In several problems from nonsmooth mechanical systems this multivalued perturbation comes from the Filippov regularization of a nonlinear discontinuous T-periodic term. \noindent Through the paper, assuming the existence of a T-periodic solution x_\eps for \eps>0 small, under the condition that x_0 is a nondegenerate cycle of the linearized unperturbed Hamiltonian system we provide a formula for the distance between any point x_0(t) and the trajectories x_\eps([0,T]) along a transversal direction to x_0(t).
