It is proved in this paper that there is a fine correlation between the values of |\zeta(1/2+i\vp_2(t))|^4 and |\zeta(1/2+it)|^4 where \vp_2(t) stands for the Jacob's ladder of the second order. This new asymptotic formula cannot be obtained in known theories of Balasubramanian, Heath-Brown and Ivic.
