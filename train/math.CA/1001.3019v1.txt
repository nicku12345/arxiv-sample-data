The nonlinear equation which is connected with the main term of the Hardy-Littlewood formula for \zeta^2(1/2+it) is studied. In this direction I obtain the fine results which cannot be reached by published methods of Balasubramanian, Heath-Brown and Ivic in the field of the Hardy-Littlewood integral.
