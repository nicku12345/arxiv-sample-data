We consider a class of linear ODEs of second order with variable coefficients and construct its Lie algebra of Lie group of equivalence transformations. Further we find invariants and differential invariants of this Lie algebra and by using them we formulate criteria of equivalence of the equations under consideration. These criteria enable us to characterize some classes integrable in quadratures.
