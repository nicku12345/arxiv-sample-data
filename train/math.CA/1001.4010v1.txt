In this study, we are concerned with spectral problems of second-order vector dynamic equations with two-point boundary value conditions and mixed derivatives, where the matrix-valued coefficient of the leading term may be singular, and the domain is non-uniform but finite. A concept of self-adjointness of the boundary conditions is introduced. The self-adjointness of the corresponding dynamic operator is discussed on a suitable admissible function space, and fundamental spectral results are obtained. The dual orthogonality of eigenfunctions is shown in a special case. Extensions to even-order Sturm-Liouville dynamic equations, linear Hamiltonian and symplectic nabla systems on general time scales are also discussed.
