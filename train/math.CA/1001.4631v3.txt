Lie's linearizability criteria for scalar second-order ordinary differential equations had been extended to systems of second-order ordinary differential equations by using geometric methods. These methods not only yield the linearizing transformations but also the solutions of the nonlinear equations. Here complex methods for a scalar ordinary differential equation are used for linearizing systems of two second-order ordinary and partial differential equations, which can use the power of the geometric method for writing the solutions. Illustrative examples of mechanical systems including the Lane-Emden type equations which have roots in the study of stellar structures are presented and discussed.
