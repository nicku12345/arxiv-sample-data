The aim of this paper is to emphasize various concepts of dichotomies for evolution equations in Banach spaces, due to the important role they play in the approach of stable, instable and central manifolds. The asymptotic properties of the solutions of the evolution equations are studied by means of the asymptotic behaviors for skew-evolution semiflows.
