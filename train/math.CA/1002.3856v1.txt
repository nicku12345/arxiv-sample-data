In the paper, we first survey some results on inequalities for bounding harmonic numbers or Euler-Mascheroni constant, and then we establish a new sharp double inequality for bounding harmonic numbers as follows: For n\in\mathbb{N}, the double inequality -\frac{1}{12n^2+{2(7-12\gamma)}/{(2\gamma-1)}}\le H(n)-\ln n-\frac1{2n}-\gamma<-\frac{1}{12n^2+6/5} is valid, with equality in the left-hand side only when n=1, where the scalars \frac{2(7-12\gamma)}{2\gamma-1} and \frac65 are the best possible.
