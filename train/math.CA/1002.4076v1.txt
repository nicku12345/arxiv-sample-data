Uncertainty principles for generating systems \{e_n\}_{n=1}^{\infty} \subset \ltwo are proven and quantify the interplay between \ell^r(\N) coefficient stability properties and time-frequency localization with respect to |t|^p power weight dispersions. As a sample result, it is proven that if the unit-norm system \{e_n\}_{n=1}^{\infty} is a Schauder basis or frame for \ltwo then the two dispersion sequences \Delta(e_n), \Delta(\bar{e_n}) and the one mean sequence \mu(e_n) cannot all be bounded. On the other hand, it is constructively proven that there exists a unit-norm exact system \{f_n\}_{n=1}^{\infty} in \ltwo for which all four of the sequences \Delta(f_n), \Delta(\bar{f_n}), \mu(f_n), \mu(\bar{f_n}) are bounded.
