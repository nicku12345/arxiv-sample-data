In this paper we deal with polynomials orthogonal with respect to an inner product involving derivatives, that is, a Sobolev inner product. Indeed, we consider Sobolev type polynomials which are orthogonal with respect to (f,g)=\int fg d\mu +\sum_{i=0}^r M_i f^{(i)}(0) g^{(i)}(0), \quad M_i \ge 0, where \mu is a certain probability measure with unbounded support. For these polynomials, we obtain the relative asymptotics with respect to orthogonal polynomials related to \mu, Mehler--Heine type asymptotics and their consequences about the asymptotic behaviour of the zeros. To establish these results we use a new approach different from the methods used in the literature up to now. The development of this technique is highly motivated by the fact that the methods used when \mu is bounded do not work.
