An approximation scheme is a family of homogeneous subsets (A_n) of a quasi-Banach space X, such that A_1 \subsetneq A_2 \subsetneq ... \subsetneq X, A_n + A_n \subset A_{K(n)}, and \bar{\cup_n A_n} = X. Continuing the line of research originating at a classical paper by S.N. Bernstein (in 1938), we give several characterizations of the approximation schemes with the property that, for every sequence \{\epsilon_n\}\searrow 0, there exists x\in X such that dist(x,A_n)\neq \mathbf{O}(\epsilon_n) (in this case we say that (X,\{A_n\}) satisfies Shapiro's Theorem). If X is a Banach space, x \in X as above exists if and only if, for every sequence \{\delta_n\} \searrow 0, there exists y \in X such that dist(y,A_n) \geq \delta_n. We give numerous examples of approximation schemes satisfying Shapiro's Theorem.
