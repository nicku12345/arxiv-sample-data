Sufficient conditions are given for the relation \lim_{t\to\infty}y(t) = 0 to hold, where y(t) is a continuous nonnegative function on [0,1) satisfying some nonlinear inequalities. The results are used for a study of large time behavior of the solutions to nonlinear evolution equations. Example of application is given for a solution to some evolution equation with a nonlinear partial differential operator.
