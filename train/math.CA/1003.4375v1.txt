Let \bbK be an ordinary differential field with derivation \partial. Let \cP be a system of n linear differential polynomial parametric equations in n-1 differential parameters with implicit ideal \id. Given a nonzero linear differential polynomial A in \id we give necessary and sufficient conditions on A for \cP to be n-1 dimensional. We prove the existence of a linear perturbation \cP_{\phi} of \cP so that the linear complete differential resultant \dcres_{\phi} associated to \cP_{\phi} is nonzero. A nonzero linear differential polynomial in \id is obtained from the lowest degree term of \dcres_{\phi} and used to provide an implicitization algorithm for \cP.
