We discuss factorization of the hypergeometric-type difference equations on the uniform lattices and show how one can construct a dynamical algebra, which corresponds to each of these equations. Some examples are exhibited, in particular, we show that several models of discrete harmonic oscillators, previously considered in a number of publications, can be treated in a unified form.
