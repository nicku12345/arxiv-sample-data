We argue that one can factorize the difference equation of hypergeometric type on the nonuniform lattices in general case. It is shown that in the most cases of q-linear spectrum of the eigenvalues this directly leads to the dynamical symmetry algebra su_q(1,1), whose generators are explicitly constructed in terms of the difference operators, obtained in the process of factorization. Thus all models with the q-linear spectrum (some of them, but not all, previously considered in a number of publications) can be treated in a unified form.
