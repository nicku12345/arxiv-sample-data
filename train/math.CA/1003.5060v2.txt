We consider the families of finite Abelian groups \ZZ/p\ZZ\times \ZZ/p\ZZ, \ZZ/p^2\ZZ and \ZZ/p\ZZ\times \ZZ/q\ZZ for p,q two distinct prime numbers. For the two first families we give a simple characterization of all functions whose support has cardinality k while the size of the spectrum satisfies a minimality condition. We do it for a large number of values of k in the third case. Such equality cases were previously known when k divides the cardinality of the group, or for groups \ZZ/p\ZZ.
