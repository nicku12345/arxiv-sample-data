The Fourier series of continuous functions of constant absolute value have interesting properties : according to the main theorems of the article, if the coefficients with positive indexes are square-summable with respect to a certain weight (any real positive power of the index), the same is true for negative indexes. The result extends to VMO and does not to bounded measurable functions.
