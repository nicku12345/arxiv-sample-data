Iterated commutators of multilinear Calderon-Zygmund operators and pointwise multiplication with functions in BMO are studied in products of Lebesgue spaces. Both strong type and weak end-point estimates are obtained, including weighted results involving the vectors weights of the multilinear Calderon-Zygmund theory recently introduced in the literature. Some better than expected estimates for certain multilinear operators are presented too.
