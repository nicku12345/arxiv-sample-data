We study asymptotics of integrals of certain rational functions that depend on parameters in a field K of characteristic zero. We use formal power series to represent the integral and prove certain identities about its coefficients following from generalized Vandermonde determinant expansion. Our result can be viewed as a parametric version of a classical theorem of Liouville. We also give applications.
