We prove sharp L^p(w) norm inequalities for the intrinsic square function (introduced recently by M. Wilson) in terms of the A_p characteristic of w for all 1<p<\infty. This implies the same sharp inequalities for the classical Lusin area integral S(f), the Littlewood-Paley g-function, and their continuous analogs S_{\psi} and g_{\psi}. Also, as a corollary, we obtain sharp weighted inequalities for any convolution Calder\'on-Zygmund operator for all 1<p\le 3/2 and 3\le p<\infty, and for its maximal truncations for 3\le p<\infty.
