We describe a wide class of polynomials, which is a natural generalization of Hurwitz stable polynomials. We also give a detailed account of so-called self-interlacing polynomials, which are dual to Hurwitz stable polynomials but have only real and simple zeroes. All proofs are given using properties of rational functions mapping the upper half-plane of the complex plane to the lower half-plane. Matrices with self-interlacing spectra and other applications of generalized Hurwitz polynomials are discussed.
