P. Br\"and\'en recently proved a conjecture due to S. Fisk, R. P. Stanley, P. R. W. McNamara and B. E. Sagan. In addition, P. Br\"and\'en gave a partial answer to a question posed by S. Fisk regarding the distribution of zeros of polynomials under the action of certain non-linear operators. In this paper, we give an extension to a result of P. Br\"and\'en, and we also answer a question posed by S. Fisk.
