The purpose of this paper is to study the L^2 boundedness of operators of the form \[ f\mapsto \psi(x) \int f(\gamma_t(x)) K(t) dt, \] where \gamma_t(x) is a C^\infty function defined on a neighborhood of the origin in (t,x)\in \R^N\times \R^n, satisfying \gamma_0(x)\equiv x, \psi is a C^\infty cutoff function supported on a small neighborhood of 0\in \R^n, and K is a "multi-parameter singular kernel" supported on a small neighborhood of 0\in \R^N. The goal is, given an appropriate class of kernels K, to give conditions on \gamma such that every operator of the above form is bounded on L^2. The case when K is a Calder\'on-Zygmund kernel was studied by Christ, Nagel, Stein, and Wainger; we generalize their conditions to the case when K has a "multi-parameter" structure. For example, when K is given by a "product kernel." Even when K is a Calder\'on-Zygmund kernel, our methods yield some new results. This is the first paper in a three part series, the later two of which are joint with E. M. Stein. The second paper deals with the related question of L^p boundedness, while the third paper deals with the special case when \gamma is real analytic.
