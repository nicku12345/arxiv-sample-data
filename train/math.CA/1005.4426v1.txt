In this paper we consider three types of discrete operators stemming from singular Radon transforms. We first extend an \ell^p result for translation invariant discrete singular Radon transforms to a class of twisted operators including an additional oscillatory component, via a simple method of descent argument. Second, we note an \ell^2 bound for quasi-translation invariant discrete twisted Radon transforms. Finally, we extend an existing \ell^2 bound for a closely related non-translation invariant discrete oscillatory integral operator with singular kernel to an \ell^p bound for all 1< p< \infty. This requires an intricate induction argument involving layers of decompositions of the operator according to the Diophantine properties of the coefficients of its polynomial phase function.
