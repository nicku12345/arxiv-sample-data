In the recent development in a various disciplines of physics, it is noted the need for including the deformed versions of the exponential functions. In this paper, we consider the deformations which have two purposes: to have them like special cases, and, even more, to acquit their inauguration from mathematical point of view. Really, we will show interesting differential and difference properties of our deformations which are important in forming and explanation of continuous and discrete models of numerous phenomena.
