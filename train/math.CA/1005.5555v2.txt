We obtain the estimates for the best approximation in the uniform metric of the classes of 2\pi -periodic functions whose (\psi ,\beta)-derivatives have a given majorant \omega of the modulus of continuity. It is shown that the estimates obtained here are asymptotically exact under some natural conditions on the parameters \psi , \omega  and \beta  defining the classes
