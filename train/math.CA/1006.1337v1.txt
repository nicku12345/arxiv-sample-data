Let u be a weak solution of  (-\Delta)^m u=f  with Dirichlet boundary conditions in a smooth bounded domain \Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^n.   Then, the main goal of this paper is to prove the following a priori estimate:  \|u\|_{W^{2m,p}_\omega(\Omega)} \le C\, \|f\|_{L^p_\omega(\Omega)},  where \omega is a weight in the Muckenhoupt class A_p.
