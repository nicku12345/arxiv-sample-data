In \cite{Lee:2006:schrod-converg}, when the spatial variable x is localized, Lee observed that the Schr\"odinger maximal operator e^{it\Delta}f(x) enjoys certain localization property in t for frequency localized functions. In this note, we give an alternative proof of this observation by using the method of stationary phase, and then include two applications: the first is on is on the equivalence of the local and the global Schr\"odinger maximal inequalities; secondly the local Schr\"odinger maximal inequality holds for f\in H^{3/8+}, which implies that e^{it\Delta}f converges to f almost everywhere if f\in H^{3/8+}. These results are not new. In this note we would like to explore them from a slightly different perspective, where the analysis of the stationary phase plays an important role.
