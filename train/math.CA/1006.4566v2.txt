We study a two-point self-avoidance energy E_q which is defined for all rectifiable curves in R^n as the double integral along the curve of 1/r^q. Here r stands for the radius of the (smallest) circle that is tangent to the curve at one point and passes through another point on the curve, with obvious natural modifications of this definition in the exceptional, non-generic cases. It turns out that finiteness of E_q(\gamma) for q\ge 2 guarantees that \gamma has no self-intersections or triple junctions and therefore must be homeomorphic to the unit circle or to a closed interval. For q>2 the energy E_q evaluated on curves in R^3 turns out to be a knot energy separating different knot types by infinite energy barriers and bounding the number of knot types below a given energy value. We also establish an explicit upper bound on the Hausdorff-distance of two curves in R^3 with finite E_q-energy that guarantees that these curves are ambient isotopic. This bound depends only on q and the energy values of the curves. Moreover, for all q that are larger than the critical exponent 2, the arclength parametrization of \gamma is of class C^{1,1-2/q}, with H\"{o}lder norm of the unit tangent depending only on q, the length of \gamma, and the local energy. The exponent 1-2/q is optimal.
