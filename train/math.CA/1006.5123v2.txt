Let {\mathbb X} be a compact, connected, Riemannian manifold (without boundary), \rho be the geodesic distance on {\mathbb X}, \mu be a probability measure on {\mathbb X}, and \{\phi_k\} be an orthonormal system of continuous functions, \phi_0(x)=1 for all x\in{\mathbb X}, \{\ell_k\}_{k=0}^\infty be an nondecreasing sequence of real numbers with \ell_0=1, \ell_k\uparrow\infty as k\to\infty, \Pi_L:={\mathsf {span}}\{\phi_j : \ell_j\le L\}, L\ge 0. We describe conditions to ensure an equivalence between the L^p norms of elements of \Pi_L with their suitably discretized versions. We also give intrinsic criteria to determine if any system of weights and nodes allows such inequalities. The results are stated in a very general form, applicable for example, when the discretization of the integrals is based on weighted averages of the elements of \Pi_L on geodesic balls rather than point evaluations.
