This is the continuation of previous article. For subspaces M^n(t) and M^{n-m}(t) which are invariant manifolds of the differential equation under consideration we build a change of variables which splits this equation into a system of two independent equations. A notion of equivalence of linear differential equations of different orders is introduced. Necessary and sufficient conditions of this equivalence are given. These results are applied to the Flocke-Lyapunov theory for linear equations with periodic coefficients with a period T. In the case when monodromy matrix of the equation has negative eigenvalues, thus reduction in R^m to an equation with constant coeficcients is possible only with doubling of reduction matrix period, we prove the possibility of splitting off in R^m of equations with negative eigenvalues of monodromy matrix with the help of a real matrix without period doubling. For the fundamental matrix of solutions of an equation with periodic coefficients X(t), X(t)=E, we find representation X(t)=\Phi(t)e^{Ht}\Phi^{+}(0) with real rectangular matrices H and \Phi(t), \Phi(t)=\Phi(t+T). We bring two applications of these results: 1) reduction of nonlinear differential equation in R^n with distinguished linear part which is periodic with period T to the equation in R^m, m>n, with a constiant matrix of coefficients of the linear part; 2) for introdusing of amplitude-phase coordinates in the neigbourhood of periodic orbit of autonomous differential equation with separation of the linear part with constant matrix of coefficients.
