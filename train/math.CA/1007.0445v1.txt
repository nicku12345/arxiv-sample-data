We prove weighted strong inequalities for the multilinear potential operator {\cal T}_{\phi} and its commutator, where the kernel \phi satisfies certain growth condition. For these operators we also obtain Fefferman-Stein type inequalities and Coifman type estimates. On the other hand we prove weighted weak type inequalities for the multilinear maximal operator \mathcal{M}_{\varphi,B} associated to a essentially nondecreasing function \varphi and to a submultiplicative Young function B. This result allows us to obtain a weighted weak type inequality for the operator {\cal T}_{\phi}.
