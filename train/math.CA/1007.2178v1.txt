The differential transformation method (DTM) enables the easy construction of a power-series solution to a nonlinear differential equation. The exponentiation operation has not been specifically addressed in the DTM literature, and constructing it iteratively is suboptimal. The recurrence for exponentiating a power series by J.C.P. Miller provides a concise implementation of exponentiation by a positive integer for DTM. An equally-concise implementation of the exponential function is also provided.
