A sufficient condition for asymptotic stability of the zero solution to an abstract nonlinear evolution problem is given. The governing equation is \dot{u}=A(t)u+F(t,u), where A(t) is a bounded linear operator in Hilbert space H and F(t,u) is a nonlinear operator, \|F(t,u)\|\leq c_0\|u\|^{1+p}, p=const >0, c_0=const>0. It is not assumed that the spectrum \sigma:=\sigma(A(t)) of A(t) lies in the fixed halfplane Rez\leq -\kappa, where \kappa>0 does not depend on t. As t\to \infty the spectrum of A(t) is allowed to tend to the imaginary axis.
