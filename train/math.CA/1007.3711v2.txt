In this article, we first improve the scalar maximal theorem for the Dunkl maximal operator by giving some precisions on the behavior of the constants of this theorem for a general reflection group. Next we complete the vector-valued theorem for the Dunkl-type Fefferman-Stein operator in the case \mathbb Z_2^d by establishing a result of exponential integrability corresponding to the case p=+\infty.
