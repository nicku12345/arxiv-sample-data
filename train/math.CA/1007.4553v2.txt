Let X be a Banach space and suppose Y\subseteq X is a Banach space compactly embedded into X, and (a_k) is a weakly null sequence of functionals in X^*. Then there exists a sequence \{\varepsilon_n\} \searrow 0 such that |a_n(y)| \leq \varepsilon_n \|y\|_Y for every n\in\mathbb{N} and every y\in Y. We prove this result and we use it for the study of fast decay of Fourier coefficients in L^p(\mathbb{T}) and frame coefficients in the Hilbert setting.
