We present a simpler proof of the existence of an exact number of one or more limit cycles to the Lienard system \dot{x}=y-F(x) , \dot {y}=-g(xt), under weaker conditions on the odd functions F(x)  and g(x)  as compared to those available in literature. We also give improved estimates of amplitudes of the limit cycle of the Van Der Pol equation for various values of the nonlinearity parameter. Moreover, the amplitude is shown to be independent of the asymptotic nature of F as |x| \to\infty.
