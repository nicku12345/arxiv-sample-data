In this paper, interpolation by scaled multi-integer translates of Gaussian kernels is studied. The main result establishes L_p Sobolev error estimates and shows that the error is controlled by the L_p multiplier norm of a Fourier multiplier closely related to the cardinal interpolant, and comparable to the Hilbert transform. Consequently, its multiplier norm is bounded independent of the grid spacing when 1<p<\infty, and involves a logarithmic term when p=1 or \infty.
