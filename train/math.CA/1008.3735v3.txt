We classify the rational solutions of the Sasano systems of types B_4^{(1)}, D_4^{(1)} and D_5^{(2)}, which are all given by the coupled P_{\rm III} systems and have the affine Weyl group symmetries of types B_4^{(1)}, D_4^{(1)} and D_5^{(2)}. The rational solutions are classified as one type by the B\"acklund transformation groups.
