Let ({\mathcal X}, d, \mu) be a metric measure space and satisfy the so-called upper doubling condition and the geometrical doubling condition. In this paper, we introduce the atomic Hardy space H^1(\mu) and prove that its dual space is the known space {\rm RBMO}(\mu) in this context. Using this duality, we establish a criterion for the boundedness of linear operators from H^1(\mu) to any Banach space. As an application of this criterion, we obtain the boundedness of Calder\'on--Zygmund operators from H^1(\mu) to L^1(\mu).
