Let M denote the dyadic Maximal Function. We show that there is a weight w, and Haar multiplier T for which the following weak-type inequality fails:  \sup_{t>0}t w\left\{x\in\mathbb R \mid |Tf(x)|>t\right\}\le C \int_{\mathbb R}|f|Mw(x)dx.  (With T replaced by M, this is a well-known fact.) This shows that a dyadic version of the so-called Muckenhoupt-Wheeden Conjecture is false. This accomplished by using current techniques in weighted inequalities to show that a particular L^2 consequence of the inequality above does not hold.
