We determine extremal entire functions for the problem of majorizing, minorizing, and approximating the Gaussian function e^{-\pi\lambda x^2} by entire functions of exponential type. This leads to the solution of analogous extremal problems for a wide class of even functions that includes most of the previously known examples (for instance \cite{CV2}, \cite{CV3}, \cite{GV} and \cite{Lit}), plus a variety of new interesting functions such as |x|^{\alpha} for -1 < \alpha; \,\log \,\bigl((x^2 + \alpha^2)/(x^2 + \beta^2)\bigr), for 0 \leq \alpha < \beta;\, \log\bigl(x^2 + \alpha^2\bigr); and x^{2n} \log x^2\,, for n \in \N. Further applications to number theory include optimal approximations of theta functions by trigonometric polynomials and optimal bounds for certain Hilbert-type inequalities related to the discrete Hardy-Littlewood-Sobolev inequality in dimension one.
