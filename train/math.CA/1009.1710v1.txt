The aim of this paper is to prove two new uncertainty principles for the Fourier-Bessel transform (or Hankel transform). The first of these results is an extension of a result of Amrein-Berthier-Benedicks, it states that a non zero function f and its Fourier-Bessel transform \mathcal{F}_\alpha (f) cannot both have support of finite measure. The second result states that the supports of f and \mathcal{F}_\alpha (f) cannot both be (\eps,\alpha)-thin, this extending a result of Shubin-Vakilian-Wolff. As a side result we prove that the dilation of a \cc_0-function are linearly independent. We also extend Faris's local uncertainty principle to the Fourier-Bessel transform.
