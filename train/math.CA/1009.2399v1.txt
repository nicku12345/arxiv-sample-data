We provide additional methods for the evaluation of the integral \begin{eqnarray} N_{0,4}(a;m) & := & \int_{0}^{\infty} \frac{dx} {\left( x^{4} + 2ax^{2} + 1 \right)^{m+1}} \end{eqnarray} where m \in {\mathbb{N}} and a \in (-1, \infty) in the form \begin{eqnarray} N_{0,4}(a;m) & = & \frac{\pi}{2^{m+3/2} (a+1)^{m+1/2} } P_{m}(a) \end{eqnarray} where P_{m}(a) is a polynomial in a. The first one is based on a method of Schwinger to evaluate integrals appearing in Feynman diagrams, the second one is a byproduct of an expression for a rational integral in terms of Schur functions. Finally, the third proof, is obtained from an integral representation involving modified Bessel functions.
