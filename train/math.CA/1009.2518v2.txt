We present a new criterion for the weighted L^p-L^q boundedness of multiplier operators for Laguerre and Hermite expansions that arise from a Laplace-Stieltjes transform. As a special case, we recover known results on weighted estimates for Laguerre and Hermite fractional integrals with a unified and simpler approach.
