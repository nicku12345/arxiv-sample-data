We prove certain endpoint restriction estimates for the paraboloid over finite fields in three and higher dimensions. Working in the bilinear setting, we are able to pass from estimates for characteristic functions to estimates for general functions while avoiding the extra logarithmic power of the field size which is introduced by the dyadic pigeonhole approach. This allows us to remove logarithmic factors from the estimates obtained by Mockenhaupt and Tao in three dimensions and those obtained by Iosevich and Koh in higher dimensions.
