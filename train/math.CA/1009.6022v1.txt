For a real polynomial p = \sum_{i=0}^{n} c_ix^i with no negative coefficients and n\geq 6, let \beta (p) = \inf_{i=1}^{n-1} c_i^2/c_{i+1}c_{i-1} (so \beta (p) \geq 1 entails that p is log concave). If \beta(p) > 1.45..., then all roots of p are in the left half plane, and moreover, there is a function \beta_0 (\theta) (for \pi/2 \leq \theta \leq \pi) \st \beta \geq \beta_0(\theta) entails all roots of p have arguments in the sector | \arg z| \geq \theta with the smallest possible \theta; we determine exactly what this function (and its inverse) is (it turns out to be piecewise smooth, and quite tractible). This is a one-parameter extension of Kurtz's theorem (which asserts that \beta \geq 4 entails all roots are real). We also prove a version of Kurtz's theorem with real (not necessarily nonnegative) coefficients.
