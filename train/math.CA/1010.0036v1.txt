This paper investigates positive harmonic functions on a domain which contains an infinite cylinder, and whose boundary is contained in the union of parallel hyperplanes. (In the plane its boundary consists of two sets of vertical semi-infinite lines.) It characterizes, in terms of the spacing between the hyperplanes, those domains for which there exist minimal harmonic functions with a certain exponential growth.
