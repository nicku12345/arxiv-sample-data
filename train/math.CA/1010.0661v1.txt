This paper is concerned with establishing uniform weighted L^p-L^q estimates for a class of operators generalizing both Radon-like operators and sublevel set operators. Such estimates are shown to hold under general circumstances whenever a scalar inequality holds for certain associated measures (the inequality is of the sort studied by Oberlin, relating measures of parallelepipeds to powers of their Euclidean volumes). These ideas lead to previously unknown, weighted affine-invariant estimates for Radon-like operators as well as new L^p-improving estimates for degenerate Radon-like operators with folding canonical relations which satisfy an additional curvature condition of Greenleaf and Seeger for FIOs (building on the ideas of Sogge and Mockenhaupt, Seeger, and Sogge); these new estimates fall outside the range of estimates which are known to hold in the generality of the FIO context.
