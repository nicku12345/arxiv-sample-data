In this paper, we first introduce L^{\sigma_1}-(\log L)^{\sigma_2} conditions satisfied by the variable kernels \Omega(x,z) for 0\leq\sigma_1\leq1 and \sigma_2\geq0. Under these new smoothness conditions, we will prove the boundedness properties of singular integral operators T_{\Omega}, fractional integrals T_{\Omega,\alpha} and parametric Marcinkiewicz integrals \mu^{\rho}_{\Omega} with variable kernels on the Hardy spaces H^p(\mathbb R^n) and weak Hardy spaces WH^p(\mathbb R^n). Moreover, by using the interpolation arguments, we can get some corresponding results for the above integral operators with variable kernels on Hardy--Lorentz spaces H^{p,q}(\mathbb R^n) for all p<q<\infty.
