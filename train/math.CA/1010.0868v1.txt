It is proved in this paper that the Jacob's ladders together with the A. Selberg's classical formula (1942) lead to a new kind of formulae for some short trigonometric sums. These formulae cannot be obtained in the classical theory of A. Selberg, and all the less, in the theories of Balasubramanian, Heath-Brown and Ivic.
