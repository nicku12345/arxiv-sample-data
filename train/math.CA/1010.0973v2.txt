Let \mathcal{L}\{f(t)\} = \int_{0}^{\infty}e^{-st}f(t)dt denote the Laplace transform of f. It is well-known that if f(t) is a piecewise continuous function on the interval t:[0,\infty) and of exponential order for t > N; then \lim_{s\to\infty}F(s) = 0, where F(s) = \mathcal{L}\{f(t)\}. In this paper we prove that the lesser known converse does not hold true; namely, if F(s) is a continuous function in terms of s for which \lim_{s\to\infty}F(s) = 0, then it does not follow that F(s) is the Laplace transform of a piecewise continuous function of exponential order.
