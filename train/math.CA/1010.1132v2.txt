In this paper, by using the atomic decomposition theory of weighted Herz-type Hardy spaces, we will obtain some strong type and weak type estimates for intrinsic square functions including the Lusin area function, Littlewood-Paley \mathcal G-function and \mathcal G^*_\lambda-function on these spaces.
