Let S be a hypersurface in \Bbb R^3 which is the graph of a smooth, finite type function \phi, and let \mu=\rho\, d\si be a surface carried measure on S, where d\si denotes the surface element on S and \rho a smooth density with suffiently small support. We derive uniform estimates for the Fourier transform \hat \mu of \mu, which are sharp except for the case where the principal face of the Newton polyhedron of \phi, when expressed in adapted coordinates, is unbounded. As an application, we prove a sharp L^p-L^2 Fourier restriction theorem for S in the case where the original coordinates are adapted to \phi. This improves on earlier joint work with M. Kempe.
