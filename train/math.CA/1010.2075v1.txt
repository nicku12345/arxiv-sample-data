Some solutions for one class of nonlinear fourth-order partial differential equations \[u_{tt} = ({\kappa u + \gamma u^2})_{xx} + \nu uu_{xxxx} + \mu u_{xxtt} + \alpha u_x u_{xxx} + \beta u_{xx}^2 \] where \alpha ,\;\beta ,\;\gamma ,\;\mu ,\,\nu  and \kappa  are arbitrary constants are presented in the paper. This equation may be thought of as a fourth-order analogue of a generalization of the Camassa-Holm equation, about which there has been considerable recent interest. Furthermore, this equation is a Boussinesq-type equation which arises as a model of vibrations of harmonic mass-spring chain. The idea of travelling wave solutions and linearization criteria for fourth-order ordinary differential equations by point transformations are applied to this problem.
