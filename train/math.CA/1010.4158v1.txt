Let m(\xi,\eta) be a measurable locally bounded function defined in \mathbb R^2. Let 1\leq p_1,q_1,p_2,q_2<\infty  such that p_i=1 implies q_i=\infty . Let also 0<p_3,q_3<\infty  and 1/p=1/p_1+1/p_2-1/p_3. We prove the following transference result: the operator  {\mathcal C}_m(f,g)(x)=\int_{\bbbr} \int_{\bbbr} \hat f(\xi) \hat g(\eta) m(\xi,\eta) e^{2\pi i x(\xi +\eta)}d\xi d\eta  initially defined for integrable functions with compact Fourier support, extends to a bounded bilinear operator from L^{p_1,q_1}(\bbbr)\times L^{p_2,q_2}(\bbbr) into L^{p_3,q_3}(\bbbr) if and only if the family of operators  {\mathcal D}_{\widetilde{m}_{t,p}} (a,b)(n) =t^{\frac{1}{p}}\int_{-\12}^{\12}\int_{-\12}^{\12}P(\xi) Q(\eta) m(t\xi,t\eta) e^{2\pi in(\xi +\eta)}d\xi d\eta  initially defined for finite sequences a=(a_{k_{1}})_{k_{1}\in \bbbz}, b=(b_{k_{2}})_{k_{2}\in \bbbz}, where P(\xi)=\sum_{k_{1}\in \bbbz}a_{k_{1}}e^{-2\pi i k_{1}\xi} and Q(\eta)=\sum_{k_{2}\in \bbbz}b_{k_{2}}e^{-2\pi i k_{2}\eta}, extend to bounded bilinear operators from l^{p_1,q_1}(\bbbz)\times l^{p_2,q_2}(\bbbz) into l^{p_3,q_3}(\bbbz) with norm bounded by uniform constant for all t>0
