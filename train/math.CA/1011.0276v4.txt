The higher order Painleve system of type D^{(1)}_{2n+2} was proposed by Y. Sasano as an extension of the sixth Painleve equation for the affine Weyl group symmetry with the aid of algebraic geometry for Okamoto initial value space. In this article, we give it as the monodromy preserving deformation of a Fuchsian system.
