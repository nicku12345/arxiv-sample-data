In this paper, the boundedness properties of commutators generated by b and intrinsic square functions in the endpoint case are discussed, where b\in BMO(\mathbb R^n). We first establish the weighted weak L\log L-type estimates for these commutator operators. Furthermore, we will prove endpoint estimates of commutators generated by BMO(\mathbb R^n)functions and intrinsic square functions in the weighted Morrey spaces L^{1,\kappa}(w) for 0<\kappa<1 and w\in A_1, and in the generalized Morrey spaces L^{1,\Theta}, where \Theta is a growth function on (0,+\infty) satisfying the doubling condition.
