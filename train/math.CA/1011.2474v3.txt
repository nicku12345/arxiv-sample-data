In this paper we study the boundary limit properties of harmonic functions on \mathbb R_+\times K, the solutions u(t,x) to the Poisson equation \[ \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial t^2} + \Delta u = 0, \] where K is a p.c.f. set and \Delta its Laplacian given by a regular harmonic structure. In particular, we prove the existence of nontangential limits of the corresponding Poisson integrals, and the analogous results of the classical Fatou theorems for bounded and nontangentially bounded harmonic functions.
