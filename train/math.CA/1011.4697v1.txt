Cauchy's condensation test allows to determine the convergence of a monotone series by looking at a weighted subseries that only involves terms of the original series indexed by the powers of two. It is natural to ask whether the converse is also true: Is it possible to determine the convergence of an arbitrary subseries of a monotone series by looking at a suitably weighted version of the original series? In this note we show that the answer is affirmative and introduce a new convergence test particularly designed for this purpose.
