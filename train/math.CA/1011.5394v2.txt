In this paper we consider the Bessel-Struve operator l_\alpha and the Bessel-Struve intertwining operator \chi_\alpha and its dual, we define and study the Bessel-Struve Sonine transform S_{\alpha,\beta} on \mathcal{E}(\mathbb{R}). We prove that S_{\alpha,\beta} is a transmutation operator from l_\alpha into l_\beta on \mathcal{E}(\mathbb{R}) and we deduce similar result for its dual S_{\alpha,\beta}^* on \mathcal{E}'(\mathbb{R}). Furthermore, invoking Weyl integral transform and the Dual Sonine transform ^tS_{\alpha,\beta} on \mathcal{D}(\mathbb{R}), we get a relation between the Bessel-Struve transforms \mathcal{F}^\alpha_{BS}  and \mathcal{F}^\beta_{BS} .
