We study several Laguerre semigroups appearing in the literature and find sharp ranges of type parameters for which these semigroups are contractive on all L^p spaces, 1\le p \le \infty. We also answer a similar question for Bessel semigroups, which in a sense are closely related to the Laguerre semigroups.
