In this letter we proved this theorem: \emph{if F be a holomorphic mapping of T_{\Omega} to a mapping manifold X such that for every compact subset K\subset \Omega the mapping F is uniformly continues on T_{K} and F(T_{K}) is a relatively compact subset of X. If the restriction of F(z) to some hyperplane \mathbb{R}^{m}+iy' is semi periodic, then F(z) is an semi mapping of T_{\Omega} to X.}
