Let \Omega\in L^q(S^{n-1}) with 1<q\le\infty be homogeneous of degree zero and has mean value zero on S^{n-1}. In this paper, we will study the boundedness of homogeneous singular integrals and Marcinkiewicz integrals with rough kernel on the weighted Morrey spaces L^{p,\kappa}(w) for q'\le p<\infty(or q'<p<\infty) and 0<\kappa<1. We will also prove that the commutator operators formed by a BMO(\mathbb R^n) function b(x) and these rough operators are bounded on the weighted Morrey spaces L^{p,\kappa}(w) for q'<p<\infty and 0<\kappa<1.
