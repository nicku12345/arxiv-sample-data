Classical Fourier analysis has an exact counterpart in group theory and in some areas of geometry. Here I'll describe how this goes for nilpotent Lie groups and for a class of Riemannian manifolds closely related to a nilpotent Lie group structure. There are also some infinite dimensional analogs but I won't go into that here. The analytic ideas are not so different from those of the classical Fourier transform and Fourier inversion theories in one real variable.
