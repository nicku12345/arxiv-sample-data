We introduce a fractional calculus on time scales using the theory of delta (or nabla) dynamic equations. The basic notions of fractional order integral and fractional order derivative on an arbitrary time scale are proposed, using the inverse Laplace transform on time scales. Useful properties of the new fractional operators are proved.
