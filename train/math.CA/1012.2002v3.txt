By means of the shift operators we introduce a new periodicity concept on time scales. This new approach will enable researchers to investigate periodicity notion on a large class of time scales whose members may not satisfy the condition: "there exists a P>0 such that t\pm P\in\mathbb{T} for all t\in\mathbb{T}", unlike the existing literature. Therefore, the results of this paper open an avenue for the investigation of periodic solutions of q-difference equations.
