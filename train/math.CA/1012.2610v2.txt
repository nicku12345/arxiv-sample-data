The purpose of this announcement is to describe a development given in a series of forthcoming papers by the authors that concern operators of the form \[ f\mapsto \psi(x) \int f(\gamma_t(x)) K(t)\: dt, \] where \gamma_t(x)=\gamma(t,x) is a C^\infty function defined on a neighborhood of the origin in (t,x)\in \mathbb{R}^N\times \mathbb{R}^n satisfying \gamma_0(x)\equiv x, K(t) is a "multi-parameter singular kernel" supported near t=0, and \psi is a cutoff function supported near x=0. This note concerns the case when K is a "product kernel". The goal is to give conditions on \gamma such that the above operator is bounded on L^p for 1<p<\infty. Associated maximal functions are also discussed. The "single-parameter" case when K is a Calder\'on-Zygmund kernel was studied by Christ, Nagel, Stein, and Wainger. The theory here extends these results to the multi-parameter context and also deals effectively with the case when \gamma is real-analytic.
