Analogues of Hausdorff-Young inequalities for the Dirac scattering transform (a.k.a. SU(1,1) nonlinear Fourier transform) were first established by Christ and Kiselev [1],[2]. Later Muscalu, Tao, and Thiele [5] raised a question if the constants can be chosen uniformly in 1\leq p\leq 2. Here we give a positive answer to that question when the Euclidean real line is replaced by its Cantor group model.
