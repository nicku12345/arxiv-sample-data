This is an extended version of originally published survey in the book: "Advances in Modern Analysis and Mathematical Modeling". Editors: Yu.F.Korobeinik, A.G.Kusraev. Vladikavkaz: Vladikavkaz Scientific Center, of the Russian Academy of Sciences and Republic of North Ossetia--Alania, 2008. P. 226-293. (In Russian).   In this survey we consider main transmutation theory topics with many applications, including author's own results. The topics covered are: transmutations for Sturm--Liouville operators, Vekua-Erdelyi-Lowndes transmutations, transmutations for general differential operators with variable coefficients, Sonine and Poisson transmutations, transmutations and fractional integrals, Buschman--Erdelyi transmutations, in the search for Volterra unitary transmutations, transmutations for singular differential operators with variable coefficients, composition method for transmutations, some applications and open problems.
