We apply the Bennett-Carbery-Tao multilinear restriction estimate in order to bound restriction operators and more general oscillatory integral operators. We get improved L^p estimates in the Stein restriction problem for dimension at least 5 and a small improvement in dimension 3. We prove similar estimates for Hormander-type oscillatory integral operators when the quadratic term in the phase function is positive definite, getting improvements in dimension at least 5. We also prove estimates for Hormander-type oscillatory integral operators in even dimensions. These last oscillatory estimates are related to improved bounds on the dimensions of curved Kakeya sets in even dimensions.
