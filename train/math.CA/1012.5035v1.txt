In this article we have successfully obtained an exact solution of a particular case of SIR and SIS epidemic models given by Kermack and Mckendrick [1] for constant population, which are described by coupled nonlinear differential equations. Our result has no limiting conditions for any parameter involved in the given models. In epidemiology many researchers believe that it is very hard to get an exact solution for such models. We hope this solution will be an opening window and good addition in the area of epidemiology.
