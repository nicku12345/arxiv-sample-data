The main aim of this paper is to provide a unified approach to deriving identities for the Bernstein polynomials using a novel generating function. We derive various functional equations and differential equations using this generating function. Using these equations, we give new proofs both for a recursive definition of the Bernstein basis functions and for derivatives of the nth degree Bernstein polynomials. We also find some new identities and properties for the Bernstein basis functions. Furthermore, we discuss analytic representations for the generalized Bernstein polynomials through the binomial or Newton distribution and Poisson distribution with mean and variance. Using this novel generating function, we also derive an identity which represents a pointwise orthogonality relation for the Bernstein basis functions. Finally, by using the mean and the variance, we generalize Szasz-Mirakjan type basis functions.
