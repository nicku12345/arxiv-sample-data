This paper concerns harmonic measure on the domains that arise when infinitely many disjoint closed discs are removed from the unit disc. It investigates which configurations of discs are unavoidable for Brownian motion, and obtains refinements of related results of Akeroyd, and of Ortega-Cerd\`{a} and Seip.
