Hypergeometric equations with a dihedral monodromy group can be solved in terms of elementary functions. This paper gives explicit general expressions for quadratic monodromy invariants for these hypergeometric equations, using a generalization of Clausen's formula and terminating double hypergeometric sums. Besides, pull-back transformations for the dihedral hypergeometric equations are presented, including Klein's pullback transformations for the equations with a finite (dihedral) monodromy group.
