We investigate Laplace type and Laplace-Stieltjes type multipliers in the d-dimensional setting of the Dunkl harmonic oscillator with the associated group of reflections isomorphic to \mathbb{Z}_2^d and in the related context of Laguerre function expansions of convolution type. We use Calder\'on-Zygmund theory to prove that these multiplier operators are bounded on weighted L^p, 1<p<\infty, and from L^1 to weak L^1.
