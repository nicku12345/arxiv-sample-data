In this paper first we survey the Tur\'an type inequalities and related problems for the Bessel functions of the first kind. Then we extend the known higher order Tur\'an type inequalities for Bessel functions of the first kind to real parameters and we deduce new closed integral representation formulae for the second kind Neumann type series of Bessel functions of the first kind occurring in the study of Tur\'an determinants of Bessel functions of the first kind. At the end of the paper we prove a Tur\'an type inequality for the Bessel functions of the second kind.
