Asymptotic expansions are given for large values of n of the generalized Bessel polynomials Y_n^\mu(z). The analysis is based on integrals that follow from the generating functions of the polynomials. A new simple expansion is given that is valid outside a compact neighborhood of the origin in the z-plane. New forms of expansions in terms of elementary functions valid in sectors not containing the turning points z=\pm i/n are derived, and a new expansion in terms of modified Bessel functions is given. Earlier asymptotic expansions of the generalized Bessel polynomials by Wong and Zhang (1997) and Dunster (2001) are discussed.
