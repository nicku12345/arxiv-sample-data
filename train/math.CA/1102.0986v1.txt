We consider measures supported on the bi-circle and review the recurrence relations satisfied by the orthogonal polynomials associated with these measures constructed using the lexicographical or reverse lexicographical ordering. New relations are derived among these recurrence coefficients. We extend the results of [8] on a parameterization for Bernstein-Szego measures supported on the bi-circle.
