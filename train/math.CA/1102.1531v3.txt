The main object of this paper is to investigate lacunary statistically ward continuity. We obtain some relations between this kind of continuity and some other kinds of continuities. It turns out that any lacunary statistically ward continuous real valued function on a lacunary statistically ward compact subset E\subset{\textbf{R}} is uniformly continuous.
