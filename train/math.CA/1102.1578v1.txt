We introduce a family of weight matrices W of the form T(t)T^*(t), T(t)=e^{\mathscr{A}t}e^{\mathscr{D}t^2}, where \mathscr{A} is certain nilpotent matrix and \mathscr{D} is a diagonal matrix with negative real entries. The weight matrices W have arbitrary size N\times N and depend on N parameters.   The orthogonal polynomials with respect to this family of weight matrices satisfy a second order differential equation with differential coefficients that are matrix polynomials F_2, F_1 and F_0 (independent of n) of degrees not bigger than 2, 1 and 0 respectively.   For size 2\times 2, we find an explicit expression for a sequence of orthonormal polynomials with respect to W. In particular, we show that one of the recurrence coefficients for this sequence of orthonormal polynomials does not asymptotically behave as a scalar multiple of the identity, as it happens in the examples studied up to now in the literature.
