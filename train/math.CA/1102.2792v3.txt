We give a unified interpretation of confluences, contiguity relations and Katz's middle convolutions for linear ordinary differential equations with polynomial coefficients and their generalization to partial differential equations. The integral representations and series expansions of their solutions are also within our interpretation. As an application to Fuchsian differential equations on the Riemann sphere, we construct a universal model of Fuchsian differential equations with a given spectral type, in particular, we construct single ordinary differential equations without apparent singularities corresponding to the rigid local systems, whose existence was an open problem presented by Katz. Furthermore we obtain an explicit solution to the connection problem for the rigid Fuchsian differential equations and the necessary and sufficient condition for their irreducibility. We give many examples calculated by our fractional calculus.
