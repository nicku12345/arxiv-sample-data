Let F be a differential field of characteristic zero. In this article, we construct Picard-Vessiot extensions of F whose differential Galois group is isomorphic to the full unipotent subgroup of the upper triangular group defined over the field of constants of F. We will also give a procedure to compute linear differential operators for our Picard-Vessiot extensions. We do not require the condition that the field of constants be algebraically closed.
