In this paper, we will study the boundedness properties of intrinsic square functions including the Lusin area integral, Littlewood-Paley g-function and g^*_\lambda-function on the weighted Morrey spaces L^{p,\kappa}(w) for 1<p<\infty and 0<\kappa<1. The corresponding commutators generated by BMO(\mathbb R^n) functions and intrinsic square functions are also discussed.
