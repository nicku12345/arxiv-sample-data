Let L=-\Delta+V be a Schr\"odinger operator acting on L^2(\mathbb R^n), n\ge1, where V\not\equiv 0 is a nonnegative locally integrable function on \mathbb R^n. In this article, we will introduce weighted Hardy spaces H^p_L(w) associated with L by means of the area integral function and study their atomic decomposition theory. We also show that the Riesz transform \nabla L^{-1/2} associated with L is bounded from our new space H^p_L(w) to the classical weighted Hardy space H^p(w) when \frac{n}{n+1}<p<1 andw\in A_1\cap RH_{(2/p)'}.
