A set \Omega, of Lebesgue measure 1, in the real line is called spectral if there is a set \Lambda of real numbers such that the exponential functions e_\lambda(x) = \exp(2\pi i \lambda x) form a complete orthonormal system on L^2(\Omega). Such a set \Lambda is called a spectrum of \Omega. In this note we present a simplified proof of the fact that any spectrum \Lambda of a set \Omega which is finite union of intervals must be periodic. The original proof is due to Bose and Madan.
