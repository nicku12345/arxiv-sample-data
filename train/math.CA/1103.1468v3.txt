In this article we prove that the union of two almost orthogonal planes in R4 is Almgren-minimal. This gives an example of a one parameter family of minimal cones, which is a phenomenon that does not exist in R3. This work is motivated by an attempt to classify the singularities of 2-dimensional Almgren-minimal sets in R4. Note that the traditional methods for proving minimality (calibrations and slicing arguments) do not apply here, we are obliged to use some more complicated arguments such as a stopping time argument, harmonic extensions, Federer-Fleming projections, etc. that are rarely used to prove minimality (they are often used to prove regularity). The regularity results for 2-dimensional Almgren minimal sets ([5],[6]) are also needed here.
