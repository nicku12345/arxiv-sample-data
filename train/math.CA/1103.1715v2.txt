In this paper, we will study the strong type and weak type estimates of intrinsic square functions including the Lusin area integral, Littlewood-Paley g-function and g^*_\lambda-function on the generalized Morrey spaces L^{p,\Phi} for 1\le p<\infty, where \Phi is a growth function on (0,\infty) satisfying the doubling condition. The boundedness of the commutators generated by BMO(\mathbb R^n) functions and intrinsic square functions is also obtained.
