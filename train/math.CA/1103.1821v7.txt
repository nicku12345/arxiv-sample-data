Let w be a Muckenhoupt weight and H^p_w(\mathbb R^n) be the weighted Hardy spaces. In this paper, by using the atomic decomposition of H^p_w(\mathbb R^n), we will show that the Bochner-Riesz operators T^\delta_R are bounded from H^p_w(\mathbb R^n) to the weighted weak Hardy spaces WH^p_w(\mathbb R^n) when 0<p<1 and \delta=n/p-(n+1)/2. This result is new even in the unweighted case.
