A famous theorem of Carleson says that, given any function f\in L^p(\TT), p\in(1,+\infty), its Fourier series (S_nf(x)) converges for almost every x\in \mathbb T. Beside this property, the series may diverge at some point, without exceeding O(n^{1/p}). We define the divergence index at x as the infimum of the positive real numbers \beta such that S_nf(x)=O(n^\beta) and we are interested in the size of the exceptional sets E_\beta, namely the sets of x\in\mathbb T with divergence index equal to \beta. We show that quasi-all functions in L^p(\TT) have a multifractal behavior with respect to this definition. Precisely, for quasi-all functions in L^p(\mathbb T), for all \beta\in[0,1/p], E_\beta has Hausdorff dimension equal to 1-\beta p. We also investigate the same problem in \mathcal C(\mathbb T), replacing polynomial divergence by logarithmic divergence. In this context, the results that we get on the size of the exceptional sets are rather surprizing.
