Injectivity of the continuous wavelet transform acting on a square integrable signal is proved under weak conditions on the Fourier transform of the wavelet, namely that it is nonzero somewhere in almost every direction. For a bounded signal (not necessarily square integrable), we show that if the continuous wavelet transform vanishes identically, then the signal must be constant.
