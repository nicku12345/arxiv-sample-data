Let L=-\Delta+V be a Schr\"odinger operator acting on L^2(\mathbb R^n), n\ge1, where V\not\equiv 0 is a nonnegative locally integrable function on \mathbb R^n. In this paper, we first define molecules for weighted Hardy spaces H^p_L(w)(0<p\le1) associated to L and establish their molecular characterizations. Then by using the atomic decomposition and molecular characterization of H^p_L(w), we will show that the imaginary power L^{i\gamma} is bounded on H^p_L(w) for n/{(n+1)}<p\le1, and the fractional integral operator L^{-\alpha/2} is bounded from H^p_L(w) to H^q_L(w^{q/p}), where 0<\alpha<\min\{n/2,1\}, n/{(n+1)}<p\le n/{(n+\alpha)} and 1/q=1/p-\alpha/n.
