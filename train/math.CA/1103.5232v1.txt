We propose a unified approach to q-special functions, which are degenerations of basic hypergeometric functions {}_2\phi_1(a,b;c;q,x). We obtain a list of seven different class of q-special functions: {}_2\phi_1, {}_1\phi_1, two different types of the q-Bessel functions, the q-Hermite-Weber functions, two different types of the q-Airy functions. We show that there exist a relation between two types of the q-Airy functions.
