Consider an arbitrary complex-valued, twice continuously differentiable, nonvanishing function \phi defined on a finite segment [a,b]\subset \mathbb{R}. Let us introduce an infinite system of functions constructed in the following way. Each subsequent function is a primitive of the preceding one multiplied or divided by \phi alternately. The obtained system of functions is a generalization of the system of powers {(x-x_{0}%)^{k}}_{k=0}^{\infty}. We study its completeness as well as the completeness of its subsets in different functional spaces. This system of recursive integrals results to be closely related to so-called L-bases arising in the theory of transmutation operators for linear ordinary differential equations. Besides the results on the completeness of the system of recursive integrals we show a deep analogy between the expansions in terms of the recursive integrals and Taylor expansions. We prove a generalization of the Taylor theorem with the Lagrange form of the remainder term and find an explicit formula for transforming a generalized Taylor expansion of a function in terms of the recursive integrals into a usual Taylor expansion. As a direct corollary of the formula we obtain the following new result concerning solutions of the Sturm-Liouville equation. Given a regular nonvanishing complex valued solution y_{0} of the equation y^{\prime\prime}+q(x)y=0, x\in(a,b), assume that it is n times differentiable at a point x_{0}% \in\lbrack a,b]. We present explicit formulas for calculating the first n derivatives at x_{0} for any solution of the equation u^{\prime\prime}+q(x)u=\lambda u. That is, an explicit map transforming the Taylor expansion of y_{0} into the Taylor expansion of u is constructed.
