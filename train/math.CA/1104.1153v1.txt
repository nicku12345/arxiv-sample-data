In this paper we study the construction of a discrete solution for a hyperbolic system of partial differentials of the strongly coupled type. In its construction, the discrete separation of matricial variable method was followed. Two separate equations in differences were obtained: a singular matricial and the other one a Sturm Liouville vectorial problem, which by the superposition principle yield a stable discrete solution.
