We establish a coupled fixed points theorem for a meaningful class of mixed monotone multivalued operators and then we use it to derive some results on existence of quasisolutions and solutions to first--order functional differential equations with state--dependent deviating arguments. Our results are very general and can be applied to functional equations featuring discontinuities with respect to all of their arguments, but we emphasize that they are new even for differential equations with continuously state--dependent delays.
