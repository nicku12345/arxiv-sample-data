For fixed u and v such that 0\leq u<v<1/2, the monotonicity of the quotients of Jacobi theta functions, namely, \theta_{j}(u|i\pi t)/\theta_{j}(v|i\pi t), j=1, 2, 3, 4, on 0<t<\infty has been established in the previous works of A.Yu. Solynin, K. Schiefermayr, and Solynin and the first author. In the present paper, we show that the quotients \theta_{2}(u|i\pi t)/\theta_{2}(v|i\pi t) and \theta_{3}(u|i\pi t)/\theta_{3}(v|i\pi t) are convex on 0<t<\infty.
