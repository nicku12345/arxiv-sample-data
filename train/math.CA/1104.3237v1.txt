Let (X,\mathcal{B},m,\tau) be a dynamical system with \ds (X,\mathcal{B},m) a probability space and \ds \tau an invertible, measure preserving transformation. The present paper deals with the almost everywhere convergence in \ds{L}^1(X) of a sequence of operators of weighted averages. Almost everywhere convergence follows once we obtain an appropriate maximal estimate and once we provide a dense class where convergence holds almost everywhere. The weights are given by convolution products of members of a sequence of probability measures \ds\{\nu_i\} defined on \ds\mathbb{Z}. We then exhibit cases of such averages, where convergence fails.
