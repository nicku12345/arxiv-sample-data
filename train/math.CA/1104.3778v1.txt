We show that multiple orthogonal polynomials for r measures (\mu_1,...,\mu_r) satisfy a system of linear recurrence relations only involving nearest neighbor multi-indices \vec{n}\pm \vec{e}_j, where \vec{e}_j are the standard unit vectors. The recurrence coefficients are not arbitrary but satisfy a system of partial difference equations with boundary values given by the recurrence coefficients of the orthogonal polynomials with each of measures \mu_j. We show how the Christoffel-Darboux formula for multiple orthogonal polynomials can be obtained easily using this information. We give explicit examples involving multiple Hermite, Charlier, Laguerre, and Jacobi polynomials.
