A class of two-dimensional systems of second-order ordinary differential equations is identified in which a system requires fewer Lie point symmetries than required to solve it. The procedure distinguishes among those which are linearizable, complex-linearizable and solvable systems. We also present the underlying concept diagrammatically that provides an analogue in \Re^{3} of the geometric linearizability criteria in \Re^2.
