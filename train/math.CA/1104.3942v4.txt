The dual purpose of this article is to establish bilinear Poincare-type estimates associated to an approximation of the identity and to explore the connections between bilinear pseudo-differential operators and bilinear potential-type operators. The common underlying theme in both topics is their applications to Leibniz-type rules in Sobolev and Campanato-Morrey spaces under Sobolev scaling.
