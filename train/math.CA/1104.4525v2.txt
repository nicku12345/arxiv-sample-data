This paper gives a classification of first order polynomial differential operators of form \mathscr{X} = X_1(x_1,x_2)\delta_1 + X_2(x_1,x_2)\delta_2, (\delta_i = \partial/\partial x_i). The classification is given through the order of an operator that is defined in this paper. Let X=\mathscr{X}y to be the differential polynomial associated with \mathscr{X}, the order of \mathscr{X}, \mathrm{ord}(\mathscr{X}), is defined as the order of a differential ideal \Lambda of differential polynomials that is a nontrivial expansion of the ideal \{X\} and with the lowest order. In this paper, we prove that there are only four possible values for the order of a differential operator, 0, 1, 2, 3, or \infty. Furthermore, when the order is finite, the expansion \Lambda is generated by X and a differential polynomial A, which can be obtained through a rational solution of a partial differential equation that is given explicitly in this paper. When the order is infinite, the expansion \Lambda is just the unit ideal. In additional, if, and only if, the order of \mathscr{X} is 0, 1, or 2, the polynomial differential equation associating with \mathscr{X} has Liouvillian first integrals. Examples for each class of differential operators are given at the end of this paper.
