We consider here a particular quadratic equation linking two elements of a C-Algebra. By analysing powers of the unknowns, it appears a double sequence of polynomials related to classical Bernoulli polynomials. We get the generating functions, integral forms and explicit formulas for the coefficients involving cosecant and tangent numbers. We also study the use of these polynomials for the calculation of some integral transforms.
