We study the nonlinear one-dimensional p-Laplacian equation  -(y'^{(p-1)})'+(p-1)q(x)y^{(p-1)}=(p-1)w(x)f(y) on (0,1), with linear separated boundary conditions. We give sufficient conditions for the existence of solutions with prescribed nodal properties concerning the behavior of f(s)/s^{(p-1)} when s are at infinity and zero. These results are more general and complementary for previous known ones for the case p=2 and q is nonnegative.
