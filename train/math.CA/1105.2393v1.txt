This paper discusses the approximation by %semigroups of operators of class (\mathscr{C}_0) on the sphere and focuses on a class of so called exponential-type multiplier operators. It is proved that such operators form a strongly continuous semigroup of contraction operators of class (\mathscr{C}_0), from which the equivalence between approximation for these operators and K-functionals introduced by the operators is given. As examples, the constructed r-th Boolean of generalized spherical Abel-Poisson operator and r-th Boolean of generalized spherical Weierstrass operator denoted by \oplus^r V_t^{\gamma} and \oplus^r W_t^{\kappa} separately (r is any positive integer, 0<\gamma,\kappa\leq1 and t>0) satisfy that   \|\oplus^r V_t^{\gamma}f - f\|_{\mathcal{X}}\approx \omega^{r\gamma}(f,t^{1/\gamma})_{\mathcal{X}} and \|\oplus^r W_t^{\kappa}f - f\|_{\mathcal{X}}\approx \omega^{2r\gamma}(f,t^{1/(2\kappa)})_{\mathcal{X}}, for all f\in \mathcal{X}, where \mathcal{X} is a Banach space of continuous functions or \mathcal{L}^p-integrable functions (1\leq p<\infty) and \|\cdot\|_{\mathcal{X}} is the norm on \mathcal{X} and \omega^s(f,t)_{\mathcal{X}} is the moduli of smoothness of degree s>0 for f\in \mathcal{X}. The saturation order and saturation class of the regular exponential-type multiplier operators with positive kernels are also obtained. Moreover, it is proved that \oplus^r V_t^{\gamma} and \oplus^r W_t^{\kappa} have the same saturation class if \gamma=2\kappa.
