We characterize two-weight norm inequalities for potential type integral operators in terms of Sawyer-type testing conditions. Our result is stated in a space of homogeneous type with no additional geometric assumptions, such as group structure or non-empty annulus property, which appeared in earlier works on the subject. One of the new ingredients in the proof is the use of a finite collection of adjacent dyadic systems recently constructed by the author and T. Hyt\"onen. We further extend the previous Euclidean characterization of two-weight norm inequalities for fractional maximal functions into spaces of homogeneous type.
