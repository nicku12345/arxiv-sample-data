This paper discusses the approximation by de la Vall\'{e}e Poussin means V_nf on the unit sphere. Especially, the lower bound of approximation is studied. As a main result, the strong converse inequality for the means is established. Namely, it is proved that there are constants C_1 and C_2 such that \begin{eqnarray*} C_1\omega(f,\frac{1}{\sqrt n})_p \leq \|V_{n}f-f\|_p \leq C_2\omega(f,\frac{1}{\sqrt n})_p \end{eqnarray*} for any p-th Lebesgue integrable or continuous function f defined on the sphere, where \omega(f,t)_p is the modulus of smoothness of f.
