In this paper, the following iterated commutators T_{*,\Pi b} of maximal operator for multilinear singular integral operators and I_{\alpha, \Pi b} of multilinear fractional integral operator are introduced and studied \aligned T_{*,\Pi b}(\vec{f})(x)&=\sup_{\delta>0}\bigg|[b_1,[b_2,...[b_{m-1},[b_m,T_\delta]_m]_{m-1}...]_2]_1 (\vec{f})(x)\bigg|, \aligned I_{\alpha, \Pi b}(\vec{f})(x)&=[b_1,[b_2,...[b_{m-1},[b_m,I_\alpha]_m]_{m-1}...]_2]_1 (\vec{f})(x), where T_\delta are the smooth truncations of the multilinear singular integral operators and I_{\alpha} is the multilinear fractional integral operator, b_i\in BMO for i=1,...,m and \vec {f}=(f_1,...,f_m). Weighted strong and L(\log L) type end-point estimates for the above iterated commutators associated with two class of multiple weights A_{\vec{p}} and A_{(\vec{p}, q)} are obtained, respectively.
