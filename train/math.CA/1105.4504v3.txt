We prove affirmatively the one dimensional case of a conjecture of Stein regarding the L^p-boundedness of the Polynomial Carleson operator, for 1<p<\infty.   The proof is based on two new ideas: i) developing a framework for \emph{higher-order wave-packet analysis} that is consistent with the time-frequency analysis of the (generalized) Carleson operator, and ii) a new tile discretization of the time-frequency plane that has the major consequence of \emph{eliminating the exceptional sets} from the analysis of the Carleson operator. As a further consequence, we are able to provide the full L^p boundedness range and prove directly -- without interpolation techniques -- the strong L^2 bound for the (generalized) Carleson operator, answering a question raised by C. Fefferman.
