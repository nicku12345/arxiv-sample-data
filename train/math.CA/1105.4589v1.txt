The goal of this paper is to study operators of the form, \[ Tf(x)= \psi(x)\int f(\gamma_t(x))K(t)\: dt, \] where \gamma is a real analytic function defined on a neighborhood of the origin in (t,x)\in \R^N\times \R^n, satisfying \gamma_0(x)\equiv x, \psi is a cutoff function supported near 0\in \R^n, and K is a "multi-parameter singular kernel" supported near 0\in \R^N. A main example is when K is a "product kernel." We also study maximal operators of the form, \[ \mathcal{M} f(x) = \psi(x)\sup_{0<\delta_1,..., \delta_N<<1} \int_{|t|<1} |f(\gamma_{\delta_1 t_1,...,\delta_N t_N}(x))|\: dt. \] We show that \mathcal{M} is bounded on L^p (1<p\leq \infty). We give conditions on \gamma under which T is bounded on L^p (1<p<\infty); these conditions hold automatically when K is a Calder\'on-Zygmund kernel. This is the final paper in a three part series. The first two papers consider the more general case when \gamma is C^\infty.
