The purpose of this paper is to study the L^p boundedness of operators of the form \[ f\mapsto \psi(x) \int f(\gamma_t(x))K(t)\: dt, \] where \gamma_t(x) is a C^\infty function defined on a neighborhood of the origin in (t,x)\in \R^N\times \R^n, satisfying \gamma_0(x)\equiv x, \psi is a C^\infty cutoff function supported on a small neighborhood of 0\in \R^n, and K is a "multi-parameter singular kernel" supported on a small neighborhood of 0\in \R^N. We also study associated maximal operators. The goal is, given an appropriate class of kernels K, to give conditions on \gamma such that every operator of the above form is bounded on L^p (1<p<\infty). The case when K is a Calder\'on-Zygmund kernel was studied by Christ, Nagel, Stein, and Wainger; we generalize their work to the case when K is (for instance) given by a "product kernel." Even when K is a Calder\'on-Zygmund kernel, our methods yield some new results. This is the second paper in a three part series. The first paper deals with the case p=2, while the third paper deals with the special case when \gamma is real analytic.
