We get sharp estimates for the distribution function of nonnegative weights, which satisfy so called A_{p_1, p_2} condition. For particular choices of parameters p_1, p_2 this condition becomes an A_p-condition or Reverse H\"{o}lder condition. We also get maximizers for these sharp estimates. We use the Bellman technique and try to carefully present and motivate our tactics. As an illustration of how these results can be used, we deduce the following result: if a weight w is in A_2 then it self-improves to a weight, which satisfies a Reverse H\"{o}lder condition.
