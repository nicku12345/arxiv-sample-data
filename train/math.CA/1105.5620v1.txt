Fourier series are considered on the one-dimensional torus for the space of periodic distributions that are the distributional derivative of a continuous function. This space of distributions is denoted \alext and is a Banach space under the Alexiewicz norm, \|f\|_\T =\sup_{|I|\leq 2\pi}|\int_I f|, the supremum being taken over intervals of length not exceeding 2\pi. It contains the periodic functions integrable in the sense of Lebesgue and Henstock-Kurzweil. Many of the properties of L^1 Fourier series continue to hold for this larger space, with the L^1 norm replaced by the Alexiewicz norm. The Riemann-Lebesgue lemma takes the form \fhat(n)=o(n) as |n|\to\infty. The convolution is defined for f\in\alext and g a periodic function of bounded variation. The convolution commutes with translations and is commutative and associative. There is the estimate \|f\ast g\|_\infty\leq \|f\|_\T \|g\|_\bv. For g\in L^1(\T), \|f\ast g\|_\T\leq \|f\|_\T \|g\|_1. As well, \widehat{f\ast g}(n)=\fhatn \hat{g}(n). There are versions of the Salem-Zygmund-Rudin-Cohen factorization theorem, Fej\'er's lemma and the Parseval equality. The trigonometric polynomials are dense in \alext. The convolution of f with a sequence of summability kernels converges to f in the Alexiewicz norm. Let D_n be the Dirichlet kernel and let f\in L^1(\T). Then \|D_n\ast f-f\|_\T\to 0 as n\to\infty. Fourier coefficients of functions of bounded variation are characterized. An appendix contains a type of Fubini theorem.
