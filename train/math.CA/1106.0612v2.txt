The second Painlev\'e equation with a large parameter (P_{II}) is analyzed by using the exact WKB analysis. The purpose of this study is to investigate the problem of the degeneration of P-Stokes geometry of (P_{II}), which relates to a kind of Stokes phenomena for asymptotic (formal) solutions of (P_{II}). We call this Stokes phenomenon a "parametric Stokes phenomenon". We formulate the connection formula for this Stokes phenomenon, and confirm it in two ways: the first one is by computing the "Voros coefficient" of (P_{II}), and the second one is by using the isomonodromic deformation theory. Our main claim is that the connection formulas derived by these two completely different methods coincide.
