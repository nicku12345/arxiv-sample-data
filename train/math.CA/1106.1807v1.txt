Let F:[a,b]\longrightarrow \R have zero derivative in a dense subset of [a,b]. What else we need to conclude that F is constant in [a,b]? We prove a result in this direction using some new Mean Value Theorems for integrals which are the real core of this paper. These Mean Value Theorems are proven easily and concisely using Lebesgue integration, but we also provide alternative and elementary proofs to some of them which keep inside the scope of the Riemann integral.
