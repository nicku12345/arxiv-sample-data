We study the notion of regular singularities for parameterized complex ordinary linear differential systems, prove an analogue of the Schlesinger theorem for systems with regular singularities and solve both a parameterized version of the weak Riemann-Hilbert Problem and a special case of the inverse problem in parameterized Picard-Vessiot theory.
