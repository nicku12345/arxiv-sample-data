Using the duplication formulas of the elliptic trigonometric functions of Gosper, we deduce some new special values for the first two Jacobi theta functions. At the end of the paper, we show how is it possible to extend our arguments and deduce a wide variety of additional special values for the Jacobi thetas. In addition, an identity is revealed between these functions and the Weber modular function.
