Let 0 < p \leq 1 and w in the Muckenhoupt class A_1. Recently, by using the weighted atomic decomposition and molecular characterization; Lee, Lin and Yang \cite{LLY} (J. Math. Anal. Appl. 301 (2005), 394--400) established that the Riesz transforms R_j, j=1, 2,...,n, are bounded on H^p_w(\mathbb R^n). In this note we extend this to the general case of weight w in the Muckenhoupt class A_\infty through molecular characterization. One difficulty, which has not been taken care in \cite{LLY}, consists in passing from atoms to all functions in H^p_w(\mathbb R^n). Furthermore, the H^p_w-boundedness of \theta-Calder\'on-Zygmund operators are also given through molecular characterization and atomic decomposition.
