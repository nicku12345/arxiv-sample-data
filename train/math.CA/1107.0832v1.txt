C. Markett proved a Cohen type inequality for the classical Laguerre expansions in the appropriate weighted L^{p} spaces. In this paper, we get a Cohen type inequality for the Fourier expansions in terms of discrete Laguerre--Sobolev orthonormal polynomials with an arbitrary (finite) number of mass points. So, we extend the result due to B. Xh. Fejzullahu and F. Marcell\'an.
