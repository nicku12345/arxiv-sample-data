We show how one can obtain an asymptotic expression for some special functions satisfying a second order differential equation with a very explicit error term starting from appropriate upper bounds.   We will work out the details for the Bessel function J_\nu (x) and the Airy function Ai(x) and find a sharp approximation for their zeros.   We also answer the question raised by Olenko by showing that   c_1 | \nu^2-1/4\,| < \sup_{x \ge 0} x^{3/2}|J_\nu(x)-\sqrt{\frac{2}{\pi x}} \, \cos (x-\frac{\pi \nu}{2}-\frac{\pi}{4}\,)| <c_2 |\nu^2-1/4\,|,   \nu \ge -1/2 \, , for some explicit numerical constants c_1 and c_2.
