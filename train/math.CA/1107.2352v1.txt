Christ, Li, Tao, and Thiele have established multilinear oscillatory integral operator inequalities under severe dimensional restrictions. These restrictions are relaxed substantially in the present paper, but are by no means eliminated. The simple method used here has the advantage of yielding power type bounds, but cannot be expected to extend to the general case.
