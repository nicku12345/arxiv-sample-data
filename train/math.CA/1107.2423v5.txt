The idea of this review article is to discuss in a unified way the orthogonality of all positive definite polynomial solutions of the q-hypergeometric difference equation on the q-linear lattice by means of a qualitative analysis of the q-Pearson equation. Therefore, our method differs from the standard ones which are based on the Favard theorem, the three-term recurrence relation and the difference equation of hypergeometric type. Our approach enables us to extend the orthogonality relations for some well-known q-polynomials of the Hahn class to a larger set of their parameters.
