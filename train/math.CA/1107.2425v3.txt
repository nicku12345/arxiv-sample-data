In this article, the study of the orthogonality properties of q-polynomials of the Hahn class started in the initial article by R. \'Alvarez-Nodarse, R. Sevinik-Ad{\i}g\"uzel, and H. Ta\c{s}eli, \textit{On the orthogonality of q-classical polynomials of the Hahn class I} is proceeded. To be more specific, the orthogonality properties of the q-polynomials belonging to the \emptyset-Hermite-Laguerre/Jacobi, \emptyset-Jacobi/Hermite-Laguerre, 0-Laguerre/Jacobi-Bessel and 0-Jacobi/Laguerre-Bessel cases are studied by taking into account the idea considered in the initial paper. In particular, a new orthogonality relation for the q-Meixner polynomials is established.
