The Riccati equations reducible to first-order linear equations by an appropriate change the dependent variable are singled out. All these equations are integrable by quadrature. A wide class of linear ordinary differential equations reducible to algebraic equations is found. It depends on two arbitrary functions. The method for solving all these equations is given. The new class contains the constant coefficient equations and Euler's equations as particular cases.
