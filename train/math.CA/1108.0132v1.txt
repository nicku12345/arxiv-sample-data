We introduce the -1 dual Hahn polynomials through an appropriate q \to -1 limit of the dual q-Hahn polynomials. These polynomials are orthogonal on a finite set of discrete points on the real axis, but in contrast to the classical orthogonal polynomials of the Askey scheme, the -1 dual Hahn polynomials do not exhibit the Leonard duality property. Instead, these polynomials satisfy a 4-th order difference eigenvalue equation and thus possess a bispectrality property. The corresponding generalized Leonard pair consists of two matrices A,B each of size N+1 \times N+1. In the eigenbasis where the matrix A is diagonal, the matrix B is 3-diagonal; but in the eigenbasis where the matrix B is diagonal, the matrix A is 5-diagonal.
