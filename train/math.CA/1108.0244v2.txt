In this paper we consider a semigroup on trigonometric expansions that will be called the Theta semigroup since its kernel is a multiple of the third Jacobi theta function. We study properties of this semigroup and prove that it is a positive diffusion semigroup. We also obtain that its subordinated semigroup is the classical Poisson semigroup. The extensions to higher dimensions and to periodic ultra distributions are also considered.
