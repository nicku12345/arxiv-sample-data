We prove L^p estimates for a class of two-dimensional multilinear forms that naturally generalize (dyadic variants of) both classical paraproducts and the twisted paraproduct introduced in [5] and studied in [1] and [6]. The method we use builds on the approach from [6] and we present it as a rather general technique for proving estimates on dyadic multilinear operators. In the particular application to "generalized paraproducts" this method is combined with combinatorics of integer partitions.
