We extend the definitions of dyadic paraproduct and t-Haar multipliers to dyadic operators that depend on the complexity (m,n), for m and n positive integers. We will use the ideas developed by Nazarov and Volberg to prove that the weighted L^2(w)-norm of a paraproduct with complexity (m,n) associated to a function b\in BMO, depends linearly on the A_2-characteristic of the weight w, linearly on the BMO-norm of b, and polynomially in the complexity. This argument provides a new proof of the linear bound for the dyadic paraproduct (the one with complexity (0,0)). Also we prove that the L^2-norm of a t-Haar multiplier for any t and weight w depends on the square root of the C_{2t}-characteristic of w times the square root of the A_2-characteristic of w^{2t} and polynomially in the complexity (m,n), recovering a result of Beznosova for the (0,0)-complexity case.
