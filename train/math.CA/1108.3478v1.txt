We use precise asymptotic expansions for Jacobi functions \phi^{(\alpha,\beta)}_\lambda parameters \alpha, \beta satisfying \alpha>1/2, \alpha>\beta>-1/2, to generalizing classical H\"ormander-type multiplier theorem for the spherical transform on a rank one Riemannian symmetric space (by Clerc/Stein and Stanton/Tomas) to the framework of Jacobi analysis. In particular, multiplier results for the spherical transform on Damek--Ricci spaces are subsumed by this approach, and it yields multiplier results for the hypergeometric `Heckman--Opdam transform' associated with a rank one root system. We obtain near-optimal L^p-L^q estimates for the integral operator associated with the convolution kernel m_a:\lambda\mapsto(\lambda^2+\rho^2)^{-a/2}, a>0.
