We show that a bounded function m on \R not necessarily integrable at infinity may still yield L^p-bounded convolution operators for the Jacobi transform if the nontangential boundary values of \omega m along the edges of a certain strip in \C yield Euclidean Fourier multipliers, for \omega suitably defined. This partially generalizes similar results by Giulini, Mauceri, and Meda (on rank one symmetric spaces) and Astengo (on Damek--Ricci spaces).
