In this paper we consider a linear homogeneous system of m equations in n unknowns with integer coefficients over the reals.   Assume that the sum of the absolute values of the coefficients of each equation does not exceed k+1 for some positive integer   k. We show that if the system has a nontrivial solution then there exists a nontrivial solution \x=(x_1,...,x_n)\trans such that \frac{|x_j|}{|x_i|}\le k^{n-1} for each i,j satisfying x_ix_j\ne 0. This inequality is sharp.   We also prove a conjecture of A. Tyszka related to our results.
