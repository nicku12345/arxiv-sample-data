This exposition presents a self-contained proof of the A_2 theorem, the quantitatively sharp norm inequality for singular integral operators in the weighted space L^2(w). The strategy of the proof is a streamlined version of the author's original one, based on a probabilistic Dyadic Representation Theorem for singular integral operators. While more recent non-probabilistic approaches are also available now, the probabilistic method provides additional structural information, which has independent interest and other applications. The presentation emphasizes connections to the David-Journ\'e T(1) theorem, whose proof is obtained as a byproduct. Only very basic Probability is used; in particular, the conditional probabilities of the original proof are completely avoided.
