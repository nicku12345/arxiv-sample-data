Systems of two ordinary and partial differential equations (ODEs and PDEs) had been obtained from a scalar complex ODE by splitting it into its real and imaginary parts. The procedure was also carried out to obtain a four dimensional system by splitting a complex system of two ODEs into its real and imaginary parts. Systems of three ODEs had not been accessible by these methods. In this paper the complex splitting is used iteratively to obtain three and four dimensional systems of ODEs and four dimensional systems of PDEs for four functions of two and four variables. The new systems of four ODEs are distinct from the class obtained by the single split of a two dimensional system. Illustrative examples are provided.
