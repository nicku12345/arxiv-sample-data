It is a well known general principle that the Fourier transform of a random measure is small, except at the zero frequency, in various senses for appropriate notions of randomness. In this note we develop analogues of this principle for two classes of random multilinear operators. Two ergodic theoretic applications, involving correlations over randomly generated sparse subsequences, are obtained as corollaries of the main results.
