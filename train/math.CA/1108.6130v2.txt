Let {z_n} be a sequence in the unit disk {z\in\mathbb{C}:|z|<1}. It is known that there exists a unique positive Borel measure in the unit circle {z\in\mathbb{C}:|z|=1} such that the orthogonal polynomials {\Phi_n} satisfy [\Phi_n(z_n)=0] for each n=1,2,.... Characteristics of the orthogonality measure and asymptotic properties of the orthogonal polynomial are given in terms of asymptotic behavior of the sequence {z_n}. Particular attention is paid to periodic sequence of zeros {z_n} of period two and three.
