In this paper we establish L^p-boundedness properties for Laplace type transform spectral multipliers associated with the Schr\"odinger operator \mathcal{L}=-\Delta +V. We obtain for this type of multipliers pointwise representation as principal value integral operators. We also characterize the UMD Banach spaces in terms of the L^p-boundedness of the imaginary powers \mathcal{L}^{i\gamma}, \gamma \in \mathbb{R}, of \mathcal{L}.
