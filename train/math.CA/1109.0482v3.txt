A (K,\Lambda) shift-modulation invariant space is a subspace of L^2(G), that is invariant by translations along elements in K and modulations by elements in \Lambda. Here G is a locally compact abelian group, and K and \Lambda are closed subgroups of G and the dual group \hat G, respectively. In this article we provide a characterization of shift-modulation invariant spaces in this general context when K and \Lambda are uniform lattices. This extends previous results known for L^2(\R^d). We develop fiberization techniques and suitable range functions adapted to LCA groups needed to provide the desired characterization.
