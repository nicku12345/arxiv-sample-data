In this paper, we consider a natural extension of several results related to Krall-type polynomials introducing a modification of a q-classical linear functional via the addition of one or two mass points. The limit relations between the q-Krall type modification of big q-Jacobi, little q-Jacobi, big q-Laguerre, and other families of the q-Hahn tableau are established.
