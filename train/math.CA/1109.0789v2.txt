In this paper, the authors construct some counterexamples to show that the generalized Carleson measure space and the Triebel-Lizorkin-type space are not equivalent for certain parameters, which was claimed to be true in [Taiwanese J. Math. 15 (2011), 919-926]. Moreover, the authors show that for some special parameters, the generalized Carleson measure space, the Triebel-Lizorkin-type space and the Besov-type space coincide with certain Triebel-Lizorkin space, which answers a question posed in Remark 6.11(i) of [Lecture Notes in Mathematics 2005, Springer-Verlag, Berlin, 2010, xi+281 pp.].
