An analog of the Riemann hypothesis is proved in this paper. Some new integral equations for the functions \pi(x) and R(x) follows. A new effect that is shown is that these function - with essentially different behavior - are the solutions of the similar integral equations.   \noindent This paper is the English version of the paper of reference \cite{1}.
