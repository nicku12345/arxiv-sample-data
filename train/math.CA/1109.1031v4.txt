Let S_\infty=A_\infty\times B_\infty be a self-similar product Cantor set in the complex plane, defined via S_\infty=\bigcup_{j=1}^L T_j(S_\infty), where T_j:\C\to\C have the form T_j(z)=\frac1{L}z+z_j and \{z_1,...,z_L\}=A+iB for some A,B\subset\rr with |A|,|B|>1 and |A||B|=L. Let S_N be the L^{-N}-neighbourhood of S_\infty, or equivalently (up to constants), its N-th Cantor iteration. We are interested in the asymptotic behaviour as N\to\infty of the {\it Favard length} of S_N, defined as the average (with respect to direction) length of its 1-dimensional projections. If the sets A and B are rational and have cardinalities at most 6, then the Favard length of S_N is bounded from above by CN^{-p/\log\log N} for some p>0. The same result holds with no restrictions on the size of A and B under certain implicit conditions concerning the generating functions of these sets. This generalizes the earlier results of Nazarov-Perez-Volberg, {\L}aba-Zhai, and Bond-Volberg.
