Eric Rains conjectured several quadratic transformations between multivariate elliptic hypergeometric functions in "Elliptic Littlewood Identities", with the integrand multiplied by interpolation functions. In this article two of these conjectures are proven in the case where the interpolation functions are constant, and we obtain a third conjecture as a corollary. Two other equations for elliptic Selberg integrals with 10 parameters, two of which multiplying to pq/t, are given, as they are needed in the proof. The proofs consist essentially of a calculation which strings together many elliptic Dixon transformations. Some remarks are made about using Fubini in cases in which product contours do not exist.
