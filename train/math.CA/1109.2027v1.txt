We consider a conjecture attributed to Muckenhoupt and Wheeden which suggests a positive relationship between the continuity of the Hardy-Littlewood maximal operator and the Hilbert transform in the weighted setting. Although continuity of the two operators is equivalent for A_p weights with 1 < p < \infty, through examples we illustrate this is not the case in more general contexts. In particular, we study weights for which the maximal operator is bounded on the corresponding L^p spaces while the Hilbert transform is not. We focus on weights which take the value zero on sets of non-zero measure and exploit this lack of strict positivity in our constructions. These type of weights and techniques have been explored previously in Reguera \cite{1008.3943} and Reguera-Thiele \cite{1011.1767}.
