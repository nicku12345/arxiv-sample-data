We prove a single sum formula for the linearization coefficients of the Bessel polynomials. In two special cases we show that our formula reduces indeed to Berg and Vignat's formulas in their proof of the positivity results about these coefficients (Constructive Approximation, 27(2008), 15-32). As a bonus we also obtain a generalization of an integral formula of Boros and Moll (J. Comput. Appl. Math. 106 (1999), 361-368).
