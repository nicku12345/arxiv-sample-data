Let \R^\R denote the set of real valued functions defined on the real line. A map D: \R^\R \to \R^\R is a {\it difference operator}, if there are real numbers a_i, b_i \ (i=1,..., n) such that (Df)(x)=\sum_{i=1}^n a_i f(x+b_i) for every f\in \R^\R  and x\in \R. A {\it system of difference equations} is a set of equations S={D_i f=g_i : i\in I}, where I is an arbitrary set of indices, D_i is a difference operator and g_i is a given function for every i\in I, and f is the unknown function. One can prove that a system S is solvable if and only if every finite subsystem of S is solvable. However, if we look for solutions belonging to a given class of functions, then the analogous statement fails. For example, there exists a system S such that every finite subsystem of S has a solution which is a trigonometric polynomial, but S has no such solution.   This phenomenon motivates the following definition. Let {\cal F} be a class of functions. The {\it solvability cardinal} \solc (\iF) of {\cal F} is the smallest cardinal \kappa such that whenever S is a system of difference equations and each subsystem of S of cardinality less than \kappa has a solution in {\cal F}, then S itselfhas a solution in {\cal F}. In this paper we determine the solvability cardinals of most function classes that occur in analysis. As it turns out, the behaviour of \solc ({\cal F}) is rather erratic. For example, \solc (\text{polynomials})=3 but \solc (\text{trigonometric polynomials})=\omega_1, \solc ({f: f\ \text{is continuous}}) = \omega_1 but \solc ({f: f\ \text{is Darboux}}) =(2^\omega)^+, and \solc (\R^\R)=\omega. We consistently determine the solvability cardinals of the classes of Borel, Lebesgue and Baire measurable functions, and give some partial answers for the Baire class 1 and Baire class \alpha functions.
