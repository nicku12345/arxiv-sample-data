Cain, Clark and Rose defined a function f\colon \RR^n \to \RR to be \emph{vertically rigid} if \graph(cf) is isometric to \graph (f) for every c \neq 0. It is \emph{horizontally rigid} if \graph(f(c \vec{x})) is isometric to \graph (f) for every c \neq 0 (see \cite{CCR}).   In an earlier paper the authors of the present paper settled Jankovi\'c's conjecture by showing that a continuous function of one variable is vertically rigid if and only if it is of the form a+bx or a+be^{kx} (a,b,k \in \RR). Later they proved that a continuous function of two variables is vertically rigid if and only if after a suitable rotation around the z-axis it is of the form a + bx + dy, a + s(y)e^{kx} or a + be^{kx} + dy (a,b,d,k \in \RR, k \neq 0, s : \RR \to \RR continuous). The problem remained open in higher dimensions.   The characterization in the case of horizontal rigidity is surprisingly simpler. C. Richter proved that a continuous function of one variable is horizontally rigid if and only if it is of the form a+bx (a,b\in \RR). The goal of the present paper is to prove that a continuous function of two variables is horizontally rigid if and only if it is of the form a + bx + dy (a,b,d \in \RR). This problem also remains open in higher dimensions.   The main new ingredient of the present paper is the use of functional equations.
