A function f:\RR^n \to \RR is called \emph{vertically rigid} if graph(cf) is isometric to graph (f) for all c \neq 0. We settled Jankovi\'c's conjecture in a separate paper by showing that a continuous function f:\RR \to \RR is vertically rigid if and only if it is of the form a+bx or a+be^{kx} (a,b,k \in \RR). Now we prove that a continuous function f:\RR^2 \to \RR is vertically rigid if and only if after a suitable rotation around the z-axis f(x,y) is of the form a + bx + dy, a + s(y)e^{kx} or a + be^{kx} + dy (a,b,d,k \in \RR, k \neq 0, s : \RR \to \RR continuous). The problem remains open in higher dimensions.
