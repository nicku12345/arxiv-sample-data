Let us say that an element of a given family \A of subsets of \R^d can be reconstructed using n test sets if there exist T_1,...,T_n \subset \R^d such that whenever A,B\in \A and the Lebesgue measures of A \cap T_i and B \cap T_i agree for each i=1,...,n then A=B. Our goal will be to find the least such n.   We prove that if \A consists of the translates of a fixed reasonably nice subset of \R^d then this minimum is n=d. In order to obtain this result we reconstruct a translate of a fixed function using d test sets as well, and also prove that under rather mild conditions the measure function f_{K,\theta} (r) = \la^{d-1} (K \cap \{x \in \RR^d : <x,\theta> = r\}) of the sections of K is absolutely continuous for almost every direction \theta. These proofs are based on techniques of harmonic analysis.   We also show that if \A consists of the magnified copies rE+t (r\ge 1, t\in\R^d) of a fixed reasonably nice set E\subset \R^d, where d\ge 2, then d+1 test sets reconstruct an element of \A. This fails in \R: we prove that an interval, and even an interval of length at least 1 cannot be reconstructed using 2 test sets.   Finally, using randomly constructed test sets, we prove that an element of a reasonably nice k-dimensional family of geometric objects can be reconstructed using 2k+1 test sets. A example from algebraic topology shows that 2k+1 is sharp in general.
