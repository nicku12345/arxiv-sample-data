We prove L^p, p\in (1,\infty) estimates on the Hilbert transform along a one variable vector field acting on functions with frequency support in an annulus. Estimates when p>2 were proved by Lacey and Li in \cite{LL1}. This paper also contains key technical ingredients for a companion paper \cite{BT} with Christoph Thiele in which L^p estimates are established for the full Hilbert transform.
