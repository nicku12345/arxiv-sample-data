Stein conjectured that the Hilbert transform in the direction of a vector field is bounded on, say, L^2 whenever v is Lipschitz. We establish a wide range of L^p estimates for this operator when v is a measurable, non-vanishing, one-variable vector field in \bbr ^2. Aside from an L^2 estimate following from a simple trick with Carleson's theorem, these estimates were unknown previously. This paper is closely related to a recent paper of the first author (\cite{B2}).
