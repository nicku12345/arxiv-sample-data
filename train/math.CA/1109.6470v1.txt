Lienard systems are very important mathematical models describing oscillatory processes arising in applied sciences. In this paper, we study polynomial Lienard systems of arbitrary degree on the plane, and develop a new method to obtain a lower bound of the maximal number of limit cycles. Using the method and basing on some known results for lower degree we obtain new estimations of the number of limit cycles in the systems which greatly improve existing results.
