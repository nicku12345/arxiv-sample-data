Let \mathcal{M}(\mathbb{R}^n) be the class of functions p:\mathbb{R}^n\to[1,\infty] bounded away from one and infinity and such that the Hardy-Littlewood maximal function is bounded on the variable Lebesgue space L^{p(\cdot)}(\mathbb{R}^n). We denote by \mathcal{M}^*(\mathbb{R}^n) the class of variable exponents p\in\mathcal{M}(\mathbb{R}^n) for which 1/p(x)=\theta/p_0+(1-\theta)/p_1(x) with some p_0\in(1,\infty), \theta\in(0,1), and p_1\in\mathcal{M}(\mathbb{R}^n). Rabinovich and Samko \cite{RS08} observed that each globally log-H\"older continuous exponent belongs to \mathcal{M}^*(\mathbb{R}^n). We show that the class \mathcal{M}^*(\mathbb{R}^n) contains many interesting exponents beyond the class of globally log-H\"older continuous exponents.
