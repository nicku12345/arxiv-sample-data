Let 0<n<d be integers and let H denote the n-dimensional Hausdorff measure restricted to an n-dimensional Lipschitz graph in R^d with slope strictly less than 1. For r>2, we prove that the r-variation and oscillation for Calder\'on-Zygmund singular integrals with odd kernel are bounded operators in L^p(H) for 1<p finite, from L^1(H) to weak-L^1(H), and from the space of bounded H-measurable functions to BMO(H). Concerning the first endpoint estimate, we actually show that such operators are bounded from the space of finite complex Radon measures in R^d to weak-L^1(H).
