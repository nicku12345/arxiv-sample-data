We prove weak-type (1,1) estimates for compositions of maximal operators with singular integrals. Our main object of interest is the operator \Delta^*\Psi where \Delta^* is Bourgain's maximal multiplier operator and \Psi is the sum of several modulated singular integrals; here our method yields a significantly improved bound for the L^q operator norm when 1 < q < 2. We also consider associated variation-norm estimates.
