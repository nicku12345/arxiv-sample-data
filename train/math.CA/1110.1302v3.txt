Let E \subset \C be a Borel set with finite length, that is, 0<\mathcal{H}^1 (E)<\infty. By a theorem of David and L\'eger, the L^2 (\mathcal{H}^1 \lfloor E)-boundedness of the singular integral associated to the Cauchy kernel (or even to one of its coordinate parts x / |z|^2,y / |z|^2,z=(x,y) \in \C) implies that E is rectifiable. We extend this result to any kernel of the form x^{2n-1} /|z|^{2n}, z=(x,y) \in \C,n \in \mathbb{N}. We thus provide the first non-trivial examples of operators not directly related with the Cauchy transform whose L^2-boundedness implies rectifiability.
