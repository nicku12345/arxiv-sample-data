We extend an estimate of Taibleson and Weiss, regarding Fourier transform of Hardy spaces, to the aniostropic setting. As consequences, we obtain necessary conditions for multiplier operators, and the anisotropic version of the Hardy-Littlewood inequality. This last inequality is strengthened with a rearrangement argument.
