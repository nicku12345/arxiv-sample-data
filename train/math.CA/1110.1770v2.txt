In this paper, we establish sufficient conditions for a singular integral T to be bounded from certain Hardy spaces H^p_L to Lebesgue spaces L^p, 0< p \le 1, and for the commutator of T and a BMO function to be weak-type bounded on Hardy space H_L^1. We then show that our sufficient conditions are applicable to the following cases: (i) T is the Riesz transform or a square function associated with the Laplace-Beltrami operator on a doubling Riemannian manifold, (ii) T is the Riesz transform associated with the magnetic Schr\"odinger operator on an Euclidean space, and (iii) T = g(L)  is a singular integral operator defined from the holomorphic functional calculus of an operator L or the spectral multiplier of a non-negative self adjoint operator L.
