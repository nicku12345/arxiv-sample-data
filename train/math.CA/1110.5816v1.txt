One of the ways that analysis on fractals is more complicated than analysis on manifolds is that the asymptotic behavior of the spectral counting function N(t) has a power law modulated by a nonconstant multiplicatively periodic function. Nevertheless, we show that for the Sierpinski gasket it is possible to write an exact formula, with no remainder term, valid for almost every t. This is a stronger result than is valid on manifolds.
