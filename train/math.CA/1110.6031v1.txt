We obtain two-weighted L^2 norm inequalities for oscillatory integral operators of convolution type on the line whose phases are of finite type. The conditions imposed on the weights involve geometrically-defined maximal functions, and the inequalities are best-possible in the sense that they imply the full L^p(\mathbb{R})\rightarrow L^q(\mathbb{R}) mapping properties of the oscillatory integrals. Our results build on work of Carbery, Soria, Vargas and the first author.
