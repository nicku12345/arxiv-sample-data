A recent paper by C.G. Kokologiannaki published in J. Math. Anal. Appl. \cite{Kolo:2012:BFI} gives some properties for ratios of modified Bessel functions and, in particular, some bounds. These bounds are said to improve the range of some inequalities in \cite{Segura:2011:BRM} or to be sharper. Unfortunately, Kokologiannaki made some mistakes in the comparison and no improvement or extension is made over the results in \cite{Segura:2011:BRM}. We explain the errors in these comments and show that the bounds given in \cite{Kolo:2012:BFI} are already contained in \cite{Segura:2011:BRM}.
