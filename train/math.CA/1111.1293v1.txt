Many versions of the Stokes theorem are known. More advanced of them require complicated mathematical machinery to be formulated which discourages the users. Our theorem is sufficiently simple to suit the handbooks and yet it is pretty general, as we assume the differential form to be continuous on a compact set F(A) and C1 "inside" while F(A) is built of "bricks" and its inner part is a C1 manifold. There is no problem of orientability and the integrals under consideration are convergent. The proof is based on integration by parts and inner approximation.
