Let w be a Muckenhoupt weight and WH^p_w(\mathbb R^n) be the weighted weak Hardy spaces. In this paper, by using the atomic decomposition of WH^p_w(\mathbb R^n), we will show that the maximal Bochner-Riesz operators T^\delta_* are bounded from WH^p_w(\mathbb R^n) to WL^p_w(\mathbb R^n) when 0<p\le1 and \delta>n/p-{(n+1)}/2. Moreover, we will also prove that the Bochner-Riesz operators T^\delta_R are bounded on WH^p_w(\mathbb R^n) for 0<p\le1 and \delta>n/p-{(n+1)}/2. Our results are new even in the unweighted case.
