In this paper we consider the space BMO_o(\mathbb{R},X) of bounded mean oscillations and odd functions on \mathbb{R} taking values in a UMD Banach space X. The functions in BMO_o(\mathbb{R},X) are characterized by Carleson type conditions involving Bessel convolutions and \gamma-radonifying norms. Also we prove that the UMD Banach spaces are the unique Banach spaces for which certain \gamma-radonifying Carleson inequalities for Bessel-Poisson integrals of BMO_o(\mathbb{R},X) functions hold.
