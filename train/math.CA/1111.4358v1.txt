In recent articles it was proved that when \mu is a finite, radial measure in \real^n with a bounded, radially decreasing density, the L^p(\mu) norm of the associated maximal operator M_\mu grows to infinity with the dimension for a small range of values of p near 1. We prove that when \mu is Lebesgue measure restricted to the unit ball and p<2, the L^p operator norms of the maximal operator are unbounded in dimension, even when the action is restricted to radially decreasing functions. In spite of this, this maximal operator admits dimension-free L^p bounds for every p>2, when restricted to radially decreasing functions. On the other hand, when \mu is the Gaussian measure, the L^p operator norms of the maximal operator grow to infinity with the dimension for any finite p> 1, even in the subspace of radially decreasing functions.
