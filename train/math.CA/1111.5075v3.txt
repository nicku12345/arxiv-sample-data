Let 0<\rho<n and \mu^{\rho}_{\Omega} be the parametric Marcinkiewicz integral. In this paper, by using the atomic decomposition theory of weighted Hardy and weak Hardy spaces, we will obtain the boundedness properties of \mu^{\rho}_\Omega on these spaces, under the Lipschitz condition imposed on the kernel \Omega.
