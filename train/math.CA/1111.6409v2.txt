The purpose of this paper is to prove a Fourier restriction estimate for certain 2-dimensional surfaces in \bbR^{2d}, d\ge 3. These surfaces are defined by a complex curve \gamma(z) of simple type, which is given by a mapping of the form % \[ z\mapsto \gamma (z) = \big(z, \, z^2,..., \, z^{d-1}, \, \phi(z) \big) \] % where \phi(z) is an analytic function on a domain \Omega \subset \bbC. This is regarded as a real mapping z=(x,y) \mapsto \gamma(x,y) from \Omega \subset \bbR^2 to \bbR^{2d}.   Our results cover the case \phi(z) = z^N for any nonnegative integer N, in all dimensions d\ge 3. Furthermore, when d=3, we have a uniform estimate, where \phi(z) may be taken to be an arbitrary polynomial of degree at most N. These results are analogues of the uniform restricted strong type estimate in \cite{BOS3}, valid for polynomial curves of simple type and some other classes of curves in \bbR^d, d\ge 3.
