We give a self-contained presentation of a novel approach to a construction of spherical harmonic expansions on the unit sphere in \NC^n. We derive a new formula for coefficients of the expansion of a smooth zonal function defined on the unit sphere and apply it in some special cases. The expansion for the Poisson--Szeg\"o kernel for the unit ball in \NC^n obtained by our method coincides with the result obtained originally by G. Folland, and on the other hand disproves results recently presented in a paper of V.A. Menegatto et al..
