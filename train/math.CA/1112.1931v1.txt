Let K be a compact set in \rd with positive Hausdorff dimension. Using a Fractional Brownian Motion, we prove that in a prevalent set of continuous functions on K, the Hausdorff dimension of the graph is equal to \dim_{\mathcal H}(K)+1. This is the largest possible value. This result generalizes a previous work due to J.M. Fraser and J.T. Hyde which was exposed in the conference {\it Fractal and Related Fields~2}. The case of \alpha-H\"olderian functions is also discussed.
