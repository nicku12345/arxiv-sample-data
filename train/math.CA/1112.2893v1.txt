We use the properties of Hermite and Kamp\'e de F\'eriet polynomials to get closed forms for the repeated derivatives of functions whose argument is a quadratic or higher-order polynomial. The results we obtain are extended to product of functions of the above argument, thus giving rise to expressions which can formally be interpreted as generalizations of the familiar Leibniz rule. Finally, examples of practical interest are discussed.
