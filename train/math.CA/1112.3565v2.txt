We discuss the global regularity for 2 dimensional minimal sets that are near a \T set, that is, whether every global minimal set in \R^n that looks like a \T set at infinity is a \T set or not. The main point is to use the topological properties of a minimal set at large scale to control its topology at smaller scales. This is the idea to prove that all 1-dimensional Almgren-minimal sets in \R^n, and all 2-dimensional Mumford-Shah minimal sets in \R^3 are cones. In this article we discuss two types of 2-dimensional minimal sets: Almgren-minimal set in \R^3 whose blow-in limit is a \T set; topological minimal sets in \R^4 whose blow-in limit is a \T set. For the first one we eliminate an existing potential counterexample that was proposed by several people, and show that a real counterexample should have a more complicated topological structure; for the second we construct a potential example using a Klein bottle.
