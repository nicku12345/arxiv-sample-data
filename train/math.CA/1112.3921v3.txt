Let \cP be a system of n linear nonhomogeneous ordinary differential polynomials in a set U of n-1 differential indeterminates. Differential resultant formulas are presented to eliminate the differential indeterminates in U from \cP. These formulas are determinants of coefficient matrices of appropriate sets of derivatives of the differential polynomials in \cP, or in a linear perturbation \cP_{\varepsilon} of \cP. In particular, the formula \dfres(\cP) is the determinant of a matrix \cM(\cP) having no zero columns if the system \cP is "super essential". As an application, if the system \frak{P} is sparse generic, such formulas can be used to compute the differential resultant \dres(\frak{P}) introduced by Li, Gao and Yuan in (Proceedings of the ISSAC'2011).
