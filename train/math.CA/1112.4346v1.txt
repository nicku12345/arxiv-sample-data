It is a classical result that dyadic partial sums of the Fourier series of functions f \in L^p(\mathbb{T}) converge almost everywhere for p \in (1, \infty). In 1968, E. A. Bredihina established an analogous result for functions belonging to the Stepanov space of almost periodic functions S^2 whose Fourier exponents satisfy a natural separation condition. Here, the maximal operator corresponding to dyadic partial summation of almost periodic Fourier series is bounded on the Stepanov spaces S^{2^k}, k \in \mathbb{N} for functions satisfying the same condition; Bredihina's result follows as a consequence. In the process of establishing these bounds, some general results are obtained which will facilitate further work on operator bounds and convergence issues in Stepanov spaces. These include a boundedness theorem for the Hilbert transform and a theorem of Littlewood--Paley type. An improvement of "S^{2^k}, k \in \mathbb{N}" to "S^p, p \in (1, \infty)" is also seen to follow from a natural conjecture on the boundedness of the Hilbert transform.
