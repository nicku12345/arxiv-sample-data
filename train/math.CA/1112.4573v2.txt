Based on the tile discretization elaborated by the author in "The Polynomial Carleson Operator", we develop a Calderon-Zygmund type decomposition of the Carleson operator. As a consequence, through a unitary method that makes no use of extrapolation techniques, we recover the previously known results regarding the largest rearrangement invariant space of functions with almost everywhere convergent Fourier series.
