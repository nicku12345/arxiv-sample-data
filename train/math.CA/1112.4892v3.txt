We consider the space A(\mathbb T) of all continuous functions f on the circle \mathbb T such that the sequence of Fourier coefficients \hat{f}=\{\hat{f}(k), ~k \in \mathbb Z\} belongs to l^1(\mathbb Z). The norm on A(\mathbb T) is defined by \|f\|_{A(\mathbb T)}=\|\hat{f}\|_{l^1(\mathbb Z)}. According to the known Beurling--Helson theorem, if \phi : \mathbb T\rightarrow\mathbb T is a continuous mapping such that \|e^{in\phi}\|_{A(\mathbb T)}=O(1), ~n\in\mathbb Z, then \phi is linear. It was conjectured by Kahane that the same conclusion about \phi is true under the assumption that \|e^{in\phi}\|_{A(\mathbb T)}=o(\log |n|). We show that if \|e^{in\phi}\|_{A(\mathbb T)}=o((\log\log |n|/\log\log\log |n|)^{1/12}) then \phi is linear.
