We consider the spaces A_p(\mathbb T) of functions f on the circle \mathbb T such that the sequence of Fourier coefficients \fu{\f}=\{\fu{\f}(k), ~k \in \mathbb Z\} belongs to l^p, ~1\leq p<2. The norm on A_p(\mathbb T) is defined by \|f\|_{A_p}=\|\fu{\f}\nolinebreak\|_{l^p}. We study the rate of growth of the norms \|e^{i\lambda\varphi}\|_{A_p} as |\lambda|\rightarrow \infty, ~\lambda\in\mathbb R, for C^1 -smooth real functions \varphi on \mathbb T. The results have natural applications to the problem on changes of variable in the spaces A_p(\mathbb T).
