In this paper the general Krall-type Askey-Wilson polynomials are introduced. These polynomials are obtained from the Askey-Wilson polynomials via the addition of two mass points to the weight function of them at the points \pm1. Several properties of such new family are considered, in particular the three-term recurrence relation and the representation as basic hypergeometric series.
