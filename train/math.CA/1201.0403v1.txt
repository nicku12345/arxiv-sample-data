We consider the spaces A_p(\mathbb T^m) of functions f on the m -dimensional torus \mathbb T^m such that the sequence of the Fourier coefficients \hat{f}=\{\hat{f}(k), ~k \in \mathbb Z^m\} belongs to l^p(\mathbb Z^m), ~1\leq p<2. The norm on A_p(\mathbb T^m) is defined by \|f\|_{A_p(\mathbb T^m)}=\|\hat{f}\|_{l^p(\mathbb Z^m)}. We study the rate of growth of the norms \|e^{i\lambda\varphi}\|_{A_p(\mathbb T^m)} as |\lambda|\rightarrow \infty, ~\lambda\in\mathbb R, for C^1 -smooth real functions \varphi on \mathbb T^m (the one-dimensional case was investigated by the author earlier). The lower estimates that we obtain have direct analogues for the spaces A_p(\mathbb R^m).
