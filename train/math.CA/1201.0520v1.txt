In the dyadic case the union of the Reverse H\"{o}lder classes, RH_p^d is strictly larger than the union of the Muckenhoupt classes  A_p^d. We introduce the RH_1^d condition as a limiting case of the RH_p^d inequalities as p tends to 1 and show the sharp bound on RH_1^d constant of the weight w in terms of its A_\infty^d constant.   We also take a look at the summation conditions of the Buckley type for the dyadic Reverse H\"{o}lder and Muckenhoupt weights and deduce them from an intrinsic lemma which gives a summation representation of the bumped average of a weight. Our lemmata also allow us to obtain summation conditions for continuous Reverse H\"{o}lder and Muckenhoupt classes of weights and both continuous and dyadic weak Reverse H\"{o}lder classes. In particular, it shows that a weight belongs to the class RH_1 if and only if it satisfies Buckley's inequality. We also show that the constant in each summation inequality of Buckley's type is comparable to the corresponding Muckenhoupt or Reverse H\"{o}lder constant.
