In this note we apply a modified fractional Bessel differential equation to the problem of describing corneal topography. We find the solution in terms of the power series. This solution has an interesting behavior at infinity which is a generalization of the classical results for modified Bessel function of order 0. Our model fits the real corneal geometry data with an error of order of a few per cent.
