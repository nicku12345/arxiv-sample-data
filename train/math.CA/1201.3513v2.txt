We construct a family of n+1 dyadic filtrations in R^n, so that every Euclidean ball B is contained in some cube Q of our family satisfying diam(Q) \le c_n diam(B) for some dimensional constant c_n. Our dyadic covering is optimal on the number of filtrations and improves previous results of Christ and Garnett/Jones by extending a construction of Mei for the n-torus. Based on this covering and motivated by applications to matrix-valued functions, we provide a dyadic nondoubling Calder\'on-Zygmund decomposition which avoids Besicovitch type coverings in Tolsa's decomposition. We also use a recent result of Hyt\"onen and Kairema to extend our dyadic nondoubling decomposition to the more general setting of upper doubling metric spaces.
