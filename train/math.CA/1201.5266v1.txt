The article is based on the differential properties of the inner generators (singularities) that occur while handling SP series (sum product series), power series whose Taylor coefficients can be written as sum-product combinations. It is an elaboration with numerical details and some explicit calculations of the chapter 6 of the joint article with Ecalle on these series. For all polynomial inputs f and all monomial inputs F, the inner generators corresponding to them verify ordinary differential equations of linear homogeneous type with polynomial coefficients. Numerical results strongly suggest the non-existence of ODEs for functions F that are rational but not monomial, i.e. not of the form {(1-ax)}^p, for p \in \mathbb{Z}.
