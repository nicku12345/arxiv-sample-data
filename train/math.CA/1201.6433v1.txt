The convolution inequality h*h(\xi) \leq B |\xi|^\theta h(\xi) defined on \Rn arises from a probabilistic representation of solutions of the n-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations, n \geq 2. Using a chaining argument, we establish the nonexistence of strictly positive fully supported solutions of this inequality if \theta \geq n/2, in all dimensions n \geq 1. We use this result to describe a chain of continuous embeddings from spaces associated with probabilistic solutions to the spaces BMO^{-1} and BMO_T^{-1} associated with the Koch-Tataru solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations.
