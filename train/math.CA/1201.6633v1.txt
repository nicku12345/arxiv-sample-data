The main purpose of this paper is to introduce and investigate a new class of generalized Bernoulli polynomials and Euler polynomials based on the q-integers. The q-analogues of well-known formulas are derived. The q-analogue of the Srivastava--Pint\'er addition theorem is obtained. We give new identities involving q-Bernstein polynomials.
