We prove a version of Carleson's Theorem in the Walsh model for vector-valued functions: For 1<p< \infty, and a UMD space Y, the Walsh-Fourier series of f \in L ^{p}(0,1;Y) converges pointwise, provided that Y is a complex interpolation space Y=[X,H]_\theta between another UMD space X and a Hilbert space H, for some \theta\in(0,1). Apparently, all known examples of UMD spaces satisfy this condition.
