We present new proofs to four versions of Peano's Existence Theorem for ordinary differential equations and systems. We hope to have gained readability with respect to other usual proofs. We also intend to highlight some ideas due to Peano which are still being used today but in specialized contexts: it appears that the lower and upper solutions method has one of its oldest roots in Peano's paper of 1886.
