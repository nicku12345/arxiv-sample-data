If (X,d) is a metric space then the map f\colon X\to X is defined to be a weak contraction if d(f(x),f(y))<d(x,y) for all x,y\in X, x\neq y. We determine the simplest non-closed sets X\subseteq \mathbb{R}^n in the sense of descriptive set theoretic complexity such that every weak contraction f\colon X\to X is constant. In order to do so, we prove that there exists a non-closed F_{\sigma} set F\subseteq \mathbb{R} such that every weak contraction f\colon F\to F is constant. Similarly, there exists a non-closed G_{\delta} set G\subseteq \mathbb{R} such that every weak contraction f\colon G\to G is constant. These answer questions of M. Elekes.   We use measure theoretic methods, first of all the concept of generalized Hausdorff measure.
