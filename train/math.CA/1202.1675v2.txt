In this paper we study Littlewood-Paley-Stein functions associated with the Poisson semigroup for the Hermite operator on functions with values in a UMD Banach space \B. If we denote by H the Hilbert space L^2((0,\infty),dt/t),\gamma(H,\B) represents the space of \gamma-radonifying operators from H into \B. We prove that the Hermite square function defines bounded operators from BMO_\mathcal{L}(\R,\B) (respectively, H^1_\mathcal{L}(\R, \B)) into BMO_\mathcal{L}(\R,\gamma(H,\B)) (respectively, H^1_\mathcal{L}(\R, \gamma(H,\B))), where BMO_\mathcal{L} and H^1_\mathcal{L} denote BMO and Hardy spaces in the Hermite setting. Also, we obtain equivalent norms in BMO_\mathcal{L}(\R, \B) and H^1_\mathcal{L}(\R,\B) by using Littlewood-Paley-Stein functions. As a consequence of our results, we establish new characterizations of the UMD Banach spaces.
