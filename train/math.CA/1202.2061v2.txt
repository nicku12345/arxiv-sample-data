Let L=-\Delta +V with non-negative potential V satisfying some appropriate reverse H\"older inequality. In this paper, we study the boundedness of the commutators of some singular integrals associated to L such as Riesz transforms and fractional integrals with the new BMO functions introduced in \cite{BHS1} on the weighted spaces L^p(w) where w belongs to the new classes of weights introduced by \cite{BHS2}.
