This paper studies the positive solutions of a class of delay differential equations with two delays. These equations originate from the modeling of hematopoietic cell populations. We give a sufficient condition on the initial function for t\leq 0 such that the solution is positive for all time t>0. The condition is "optimal". We also discuss the long time behavior of these positive solutions through a dynamical system on the space of continuous functions. We give a characteristic description of the \omega limit set of this dynamical system, which can provide informations about the long time behavior of positive solutions of the delay differential equation.
