This paper is dedicated to study weighted L^p inequalities for pseudo-differential operators with amplitudes and their commutators by using the new class of weights A_p^\vc and the new BMO function space BMO_\vc which are larger than the Muckenhoupt class of weights A_p and classical BMO space BMO, respectively. The obtained results therefore improve substantially some well-known results.
