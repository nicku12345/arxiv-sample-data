Let L be a non-negative self-adjoint operator on L^2(\mathbb{R}^n). By spectral theory, we can define the operator F(L), which is bounded on L^2(X), for any bounded Borel function F. In this paper, we study the sharp weighted L^p estimates for spectral multipliers F(L) and their commutators [b, F(L)] with BMO functions b. We would like to emphasize that the Gaussian upper bound condition on the heat kernels associated to the semigroups e^{-tL} is not assumed in this paper.
