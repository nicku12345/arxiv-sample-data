Let L be the infinitesimal generator of an analytic semigroup on L^2(\mathbb R^n) with Gaussian kernel bound, and let L^{-\alpha/2} be the fractional integrals of L for 0<\alpha<n. In this paper, we will obtain some boundedness properties of commutators \big[b,L^{-\alpha/2}\big] on the weighted Morrey spaces L^{p,\kappa}(w) when the symbol b belongs to BMO(\mathbb R^n) or homogeneous Lipschitz space.
