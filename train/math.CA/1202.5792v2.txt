We construct a variety of mappings of the unit interval into \mathcal{L}^p([0,1]) to generalize classical examples of \mathcal{L}^p-convergence of sequences of functions with simultaneous pointwise divergence. By establishing relations between the regularity of the functions in the image of the mappings and the topology of [0,1], we obtain examples which are \mathcal{L}^p-continuous but exhibit discontinuity in a pointwise sense to different degrees. We conclude by proving an Egorov-type theorem, namely that if almost every function in the image is continuous, then we can remove a set of arbitrarily small measure from the index set [0,1] and establish pointwise limits for all functions in the remaining image.
