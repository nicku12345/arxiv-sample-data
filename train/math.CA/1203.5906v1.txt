We obtain the off-diagonal Muckenhoupt-Wheeden conjecture for Calder\'on-Zygmund operators. Namely, given 1<p<q<\infty and a pair of weights (u,v), if the Hardy-Littlewood maximal function satisfies the following two weight inequalities:  M : L^p(v) \rightarrow L^q(u) \quad \text{and} \quad M: L^{q'}(u^{1-q'}) \rightarrow L^{p'}(v^{1-p'}),  then any Calder\'on-Zygmund operator T and its associated truncated maximal operator T_\star are bounded from L^p(v) to L^q(u). Additionally, assuming only the second estimate for M then T and T_\star map continuously L^p(v) into L^{q,\infty}(u). We also consider the case of generalized Haar shift operators and show that their off-diagonal two weight estimates are governed by the corresponding estimates for the dyadic Hardy-Littlewood maximal function.
