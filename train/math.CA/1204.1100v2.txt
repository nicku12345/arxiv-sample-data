Let X be a Polish space. We prove that the generic compact set K\subseteq X (in the sense of Baire category) is either finite or there is a continuous gauge function h such that 0<\mathcal{H}^{h}(K)<\infty, where \mathcal{H}^h denotes the h-Hausdorff measure. This answers a question of C. Cabrelli, U. B. Darji, and U. M. Molter. Moreover, for every weak contraction f\colon K\to X we have \mathcal{H}^{h} (K\cap f(K))=0. This is a measure theoretic analogue of a result of M. Elekes.
