We will present an estimation of the H_{k_{0},k_{r}}^{q}f \ and % H_{u}^{\lambda \varphi}f means as a approximation versions \ of \ the Totik type generalization(\text{see \cite{11, 12}})  \ of the results of \ J. Marcinkiewicz and A. Zygmund in \cite{JM, ZA}. As a measure of such approximations we will use the function constructed on the base of definition of the Gabisonia points \cite{1}. Some results on the norm approximation will also given.
