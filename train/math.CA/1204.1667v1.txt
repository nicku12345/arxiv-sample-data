In this expository article we collect and discuss some recent results on different consequences of a Sharp Reverse H\"older Inequality for A_{\infty} weights. For two given operators T and S, we study L^p(w) bounds of Coifman-Fefferman type.  \|Tf\|_{L^p(w)}\le c_{n,w,p} \|Sf\|_{L^p(w)},  that can be understood as a way to control T by S. We will focus on a \emph{quantitative} analysis of the constants involved and show that we can improve classical results regarding the dependence on the weight w in terms of Wilson's A_{\infty} constant  [w]_{A_{\infty}}:=\sup_Q\frac{1}{w(Q)}\int_Q M(w\chi_Q). We will also exhibit recent improvements on the problem of finding sharp constants for weighted norm inequalities involving several singular operators. We obtain mixed A_{1}--A_{\infty} estimates for the commutator [b,T] and for its higher order analogue T^k_{b}. A common ingredient in the proofs presented here is a recent improvement of the Reverse H\"older Inequality for A_{\infty} weights involving Wilson's constant.
