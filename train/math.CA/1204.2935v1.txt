We formulate some special conditions for the integrable functions and moduli of continuity. We give the results on rate of approximation of such functions by matrix means of their Fourier series, where the entries of the rows of the matrix generate the sequences belonging to the classes MRBVS and MHBVS. We also present some results on norm approximation for functions from the generalized integral Lipschitz classes.
