We consider summability methods generated by the class GM(2b). We generalize some related results of P. Pych-Taberska [Studia Math. XCVI (1990), 91-103] on strong approximation of almost periodic functions by their Fourier series and S. M. Mazhar and V. Totik [J. Approx. Theory, 60(1990), 174-182] on approximation of periodic functions by matrix means of their Fourier series.
