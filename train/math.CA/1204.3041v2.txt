In this paper, we improve a recent result by Li and Peng on products of functions in H_L^1(\bR^d) and BMO_L(\bR^d), where L=-\Delta+V is a Schr\"odinger operator with V satisfying an appropriate reverse H\"older inequality. More precisely, we prove that such products may be written as the sum of two continuous bilinear operators, one from H_L^1(\bR^d)\times BMO_L(\bR^d)  into L^1(\bR^d), the other one from H^1_L(\bR^d)\times BMO_L(\bR^d)  into H^{\log}(\bR^d), where the space H^{\log}(\bR^d) is the set of distributions f whose grand maximal function \mathfrak Mf satisfies \int_{\mathbb R^d} \frac {|\mathfrak M f(x)|}{\log (e+ |\mathfrak Mf(x)|)+ \log(e+|x|)}dx <\infty.
