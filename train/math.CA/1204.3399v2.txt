In a series of letters to D.Stanton, R.W.Gosper presented many strange evaluations of hypergeometric series. Recently, we rediscovered one of the strange hypergeometric identities appearing in [Go]. In this paper, we prove this identity and derive its generalization using contiguity operators. Key Words and Phrases: hypergeometric series, strange evaluation, contiguity operator. 2010 Mathematics Subject Classification Numbers: 33C05.
