We consider a reducible generalized hypergeometric equation, whose sub-equation possesses apparent singular points. We determine the polynomial whose roots are these points. We show that this polynomial is a generalized hypergeometric polynomial.   Key Words and Phrases. the generalized hypergeometric equation, reducible, apparent singular point, minor of Wronskian.
