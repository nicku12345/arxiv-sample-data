We prove an extrapolation result for general operators under some weak assumptions on the boundedness of the operator. In particular, we show that if the operator is weakly bounded on some L^{p_{0}}(w), for all "flat" weights, w in A_{p_{0}}, 1 < p_{0} <\infty, then for p in some small neighborhood around p_{0}, and all "flat" A_{p} weights, w, the operator is weakly bounded on L^{p}(w), and as a result we get strong type estimates for the operator.
