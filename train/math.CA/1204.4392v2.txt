We prove two-sided inequalities between the integral moduli of smoothness of a function on \mathbb{R}^d/\mathbb{T}^d and the weighted tail-type integrals of its Fourier transform/series.   Sharpness of obtained results in particular is given by the equivalence results for functions satisfying certain regular conditions. Applications include a quantitative form of the Riemann-Lebesgue lemma as well as several other questions in approximation theory and the theory of function spaces.
