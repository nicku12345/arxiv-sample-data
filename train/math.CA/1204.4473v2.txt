For a given \theta\in (-1,1), we find out all parameters \alpha,\beta\in \{0,1\} such that, there exists a linear combination of Jacobi polynomials J_{n+1}^{(\alpha,\beta)}(x)-C J_{n}^{(\alpha,\beta)}(x) which generates a Lobatto (Radau) positive quadrature formula of degree of exactness \textcolor{red}{2n+2 (2n+1)} and contains the point \theta as a node. These positive quadratures are very useful in studying problems in one-sided polynomial L_1 approximation.
