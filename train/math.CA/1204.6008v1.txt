In this note, we aim to describe sharp constants for the composition operator with a bi-Lipschitz measure-preserving map in several functional spaces (BMO, Hardy space, Carleson measures, ...). It is interesting to see how the measure preserving property allows us to improve these constants. Moreover, we will prove the optimality of our results for the BMO space and describe improved estimates for solutions of transport PDEs.
