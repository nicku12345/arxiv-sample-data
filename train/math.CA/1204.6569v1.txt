We have found several summation formulas that extend Ramanujan's psi sum. First contains a parameter \alpha=1/N, N is a positive integer, and transforms to q-beta integral in the limit N\to\infty. The other is a q-analogue of generalized binomial theorem, expansion of (1+t)^a in powers of t^\alpha, 0<\alpha\leq 1, and it expresses the sum of a certain series in terms of a bibasic integral.
