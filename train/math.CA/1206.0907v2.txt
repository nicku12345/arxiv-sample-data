We prove a local Tb theorem under close to minimal (up to certain `buffering') integrability assumptions, conjectured by S. Hofmann (El Escorial, 2008): Every cube is assumed to support two non-degenerate functions b^1_Q\in L^p and b^2_Q\in L^q such that 1_{2Q}Tb^1_Q\in L^{q'} and 1_{2Q}T^*b^2_Q\in L^{p'}, with appropriate uniformity and scaling of the norms. This is sufficient for the L^2-boundedness of the Calderon-Zygmund operator T, for any p,q\in(1,\infty), a result previously unknown for simultaneously small values of p and q. We obtain this as a corollary of a local Tb theorem for the maximal truncations T_{\#} and (T^*)_{\#}: for the L^2-boundedness of T, it suffices that 1_Q T_{\#}b^1_Q and 1_Q (T^*)_{\#}b^2_Q be uniformly in L^0. The proof builds on the technique of suppressed operators from the quantitative Vitushkin conjecture due to Nazarov-Treil-Volberg.
