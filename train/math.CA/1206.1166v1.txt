We consider integral and series transformations, which are associated with Ramanujan's identities, involving various arithmetic functions and a ratio of products of Riemann's zeta functions of different arguments. Reciprocal inversion formulas are proved in a Banach space of functions whose Mellin's transforms are integrable over the vertical line Re s > 1. Examples of new transformations like Widder-Lambert and Kontorovich-Lebedev type are exhibited. Particular cases include familiar Lambert and Mobius transformations. Finally a class of equivalences of the Salem type to the Riemann hypothesis is established.
