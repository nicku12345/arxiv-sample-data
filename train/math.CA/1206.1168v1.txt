A different application of the familiar integral representation for the modifed Bessel function drives to a new Kontorovich-Lebedev-like integral transformation of a general complex index. Mapping and operational properties, a convolution operator and inversion formula are established. Solvability conditions and explicit solutions of the corresponding class of convolution integral equations are exhibited.
