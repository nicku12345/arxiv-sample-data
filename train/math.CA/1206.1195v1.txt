The aim of this paper is to prove new uncertainty principles for an integral operator \tt with a bounded kernel for which there is a Plancherel theorem. The first of these results is an extension of Faris's local uncertainty principle which states that if a nonzero function f\in L^2(\R^d,\mu) is highly localized near a single point then \tt (f) cannot be concentrated in a set of finite measure. The second result extends the Benedicks-Amrein-Berthier uncertainty principle and states that a nonzero function f\in L^2(\R^d,\mu) and its integral transform \tt (f) cannot both have support of finite measure. From these two results we deduce a global uncertainty principle of Heisenberg type for the transformation \tt. We apply our results to obtain a new uncertainty principles for the Dunkl and Clifford Fourier transforms.
