We obtain sharp two-sided inequalities between L^p-norms (1<p<\infty) of functions Hf and H^*f, where H is the Hardy operator, H^* is its dual, and f is a nonnegative measurable function on (0,\infty). In an equivalent form, it gives sharp constants in the two-sided relations between L^p-norms of functions H\f-\f and \f, where \f is a nonnegative nonincreasing function on (0,+\infty) with \f(+\infty)=0. In particular, it provides an alternative proof of a result obtained by N. Kruglyak and E. Setterqvist (2008) for p=2k (k\in \N) and by S. Boza and J. Soria (2011) for all p\ge 2, and gives a sharp version of this result for 1<p<2.
