Let L^{m,p}(\R^n) denote the Sobolev space of functions whose m-th derivatives lie in L^p(\R^n), and assume that p>n. For E \subset \R^n, denote by L^{m,p}(E) the space of restrictions to E of functions F \in L^{m,p}(\R^n). It is known that there exist bounded linear maps T : L^{m,p}(E) \rightarrow L^{m,p}(\R^n) such that Tf = f on E for any f \in L^{m,p}(E). We show that T cannot have a simple form called "bounded depth."
