We prove a sufficient condition for frame-type wavelet series in L^p, the Hardy space H^1, and BMO. For example, functions in these spaces are shown to have expansions in terms of the Mexican hat wavelet, thus giving a strong answer to an old question of Meyer.   Bijectivity of the wavelet frame operator acting on Hardy space is established with the help of new frequency-domain estimates on the Calder\'on-Zygmund constants of the frame kernel.
