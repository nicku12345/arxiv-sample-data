Here we show that Lerner's method of local mean oscillation gives a simple proof of the A_2 conjecture for spaces of homogeneous type: that is, the linear dependence on the A_2 norm for weighted L^2 Calderon-Zygmund operator estimates. In the Euclidean case, the result is due to Hyt\"{o}nen, and for geometrically doubling spaces, Nazarov, Rezinikov, and Volberg obtained the linear bound.
