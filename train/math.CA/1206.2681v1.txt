In recent years, a number of experimental studies have been conducted to investigate the mechanical behavior and damage mechanisms of articular cartilage under impact loading. Some experimentally observed results have been explained using a non-linear viscoelastic impact model. At the same time, there is the need of simple mathematical models, which allow comparing experimental results obtained in drop impact testing with impact loads of different weights and incident velocities. The objective of this study was to investigate theoretically whether the main features of articular impact could be qualitatively predicted using a linear viscoelastic theory or the linear biphasic theory. In the present paper, exact analytical solutions are obtained for the main parameters of the Kelvin-Voigt and Maxwell impact models. Perturbation analysis of the impact process according to the standard viscoelastic solid model is performed. Asymptotic solutions are obtained for the drop weight impact test. The dependence of the coefficient of restitution on the impactor parameters has been studied in detail.
