A slight modification of the Kontorovich-Lebedev transform is an automorphism on the vector space of polynomials. The action of this KL_{\alpha}-transform over certain polynomial sequences will be under discussion, and a special attention will be given the d-orthogonal ones. For instance, the Continuous Dual Hahn polynomials appear as the KL_{\alpha}-transform of a 2-orthogonal sequence of Laguerre type. Finally, all the orthogonal polynomial sequences whose KL_{\alpha}-transform is a d-orthogonal sequence will be characterized: they are essencially semiclassical polynomials fulfilling particular conditions and d is even. The Hermite and Laguerre polynomials are the classical solutions to this problem.
