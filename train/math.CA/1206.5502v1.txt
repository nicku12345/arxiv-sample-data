In this paper, we prove that for x\in(0,{\pi}/2) (cos p_0x)^{1/p_0}<((sin x)/x)<(cos(x/3))^3 with the best constants p_0=0.347307245464... and 1/3. Moreover, if p\in (0,1/3] then the double inequality {\beta}_{p}(cos px)^{1/p}<((sin x)/x)<(cos px)^{1/p} holds for x\in(0,{\pi}/2), where {\beta}_{p}=2{\pi}^-1(cos((p{\pi})/2))^{-1/p} and 1 are the best possible. Its reverse one holds if p\in[1/2,1]. As applications, some new inequalities are established.
