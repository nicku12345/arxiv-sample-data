Let s: [1, \infty) \to \C be a locally integrable function in Lebesgue's sense on the infinite interval [1, \infty). We say that s is summable (L, 1) if there exists some A\in \C such that \lim_{t\to \infty} \tau(t) = A, \quad {\rm where} \quad \tau(t):= {1\over \log t} \int^t_1 {s(u) \over u} du.\leqno(*) It is clear that if the ordinary limit s(t) \to A exists, then the limit \tau(t) \to A also exists as t\to \infty. We present sufficient conditions, which are also necessary in order that the converse implication hold true. As corollaries, we obtain so-called Tauberian theorems which are analogous to those known in the case of summability (C,1). For example, if the function s is slowly oscillating, by which we mean that for every \e>0 there exist t_0 = t_0 (\e) > 1 and \lambda=\lambda(\e) > 1 such that |s(u) - s(t)| \le \e \quad {\rm whenever}\quad t_0 \le t < u \le t^\lambda, then the converse implication holds true: the ordinary convergence \lim_{t\to \infty} s(t) = A follows from (*).   We also present necessary and sufficient Tauberian conditions under which the ordinary convergence of a numerical sequence (s_k) follows from its logarithmic summability. Among others, we give a more transparent proof of an earlier Tauberian theorem due to Kwee [3].
