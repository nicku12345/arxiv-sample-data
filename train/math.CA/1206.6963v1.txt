Let s:[1,\infty) \to \C  be a locally integrable function in Lebesgue's sense. The logarithmic (also called harmonic) mean of the function s is defined by [\tau(t) := \frac 1{\log t} \int_1^t \frac {s(x)}{x} dx, \qquad t>1,] where the logarithm is to base e. Besides the ordinary limit \lim_{x\to \infty} s(x), we also use the notion of the so-called statistical limit of s at \infty, in notation:  \stlim_{x\to \infty} s(x)=\ell , by which we mean that for every \e>0, [\lim_{b\to \infty} \frac 1b \Big | \Big {x\in(1,b): |s(x)-\ell| >\e \Big} \Big| = 0.] We also use the ordinary limit \lim_{t\to\infty} \tau(t) as well as the statistical limit \stlim_{t\to\infty} \tau(t).   We will prove the following Tauberian theorem: Suppose that the real-valued function s is slowly decreasing or the complex-valued s is slowly oscillating. If the statistical limit \stlim_{t\to\infty} \tau(t) =\ell  exists, then the ordinary limit \lim_{x\to\infty} s(x) = \ell  also exists.
