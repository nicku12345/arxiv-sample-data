In this paper, a new identity for convex functions is derived. A consequence of the identity is that we can derive new estimates for the remainder term of the midpoint, trapezoid, and Simpson formulae for functions whose derivatives in absolute value at certain power are convex. Some applications to special means of real numbers are also given.
