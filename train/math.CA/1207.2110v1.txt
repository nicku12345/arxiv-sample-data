The generalized complex numbers can be realized in terms of 2\times2 or higher-order matrices and can be exploited to get different ways of looking at the trigonometric functions. Since Chebyshev polynomials are linked to the power of matrices and to trigonometric functions, we take the quite natural step to discuss them in the context of the theory of generalized complex numbers. We also briefly discuss the two-variable Chebyshev polynomials and their link with the third-order Hermite polynomials.
