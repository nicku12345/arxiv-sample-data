In this article we present a new proof of a sharp Reverse H\"older Inequality for A_\infty weights that is valid in the context of spaces of homogeneous type. Then we derive two applications: a precise open property of Muckenhoupt classes and, as a consequence of this last result, we obtain a simple proof of a sharp weighted bound for the Hardy-Littlewood maximal function involving A_\infty constants: |M|_{L^p(w)} \leq c (\frac{1}{p-1} [w]_{A_p}[\sigma]_{A_\infty})^{1/p}, where 1<p<\infty, \sigma=w^{\frac{1}{1-p}} and c depends only on the doubling constant of the measure \mu and the geometric constant \kappa of the quasimetric.
