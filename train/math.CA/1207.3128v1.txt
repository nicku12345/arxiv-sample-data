Let M_G denotes the centered Hardy-Littlewood maximal function associated to the Carnot-Carath\'eodory distance or to the pseudo-distance associated to the fundamental solution of the Grushin operator on \R_x^n \times \R_u, \Delta_G = \sum_{i = 1}^n \frac{\partial^2}{\partial x_i^2} + (\sum_{i = 1}^n x_i^2) \frac{\partial^2}{\partial u^2}. We get L^p (p > 1) dimension free estimates for M_G. We prove also that there exists a constant A > 0 such that \| M_G \|_{L^1 \longrightarrow L^{1, \infty}} \leq A n, \forall n.
