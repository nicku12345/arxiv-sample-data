We consider weighted norm inequalities for the Riesz potentials I_\alpha, also referred to as fractional integral operators. First we prove mixed A_p-A_\infty type estimates in the spirit of [13, 15, 17]. Then we prove strong and weak type inequalities in the case p<q using the so-called log bump conditions. These results complement the strong type inequalities of P\'erez [30] and answer a conjecture from [3]. For both sets of results our main tool is a corona decomposition adapted to fractional averages.
