An expression for the coefficients of a linear iterative equation in terms of the parameters of the source equation is given both for equations in standard form and for equations in reduced normal form. The operator generating an iterative equation of a general order in reduced normal form is also obtained and some other properties of iterative equations are established. In particular, a simple necessary and sufficient condition for an equation to be iterative is given for the general fourth-order linear equation solely in terms of its coefficients.
