In [1], an operator was introduced which acts parallel to the Riemann-Liouville differintegral on a transformation of the space of real analytic functions and commutes with itself. This paper aims to extend the technique - and its defining characteristic, commutativity - to all real continuous functions, up to the degree to which they are differentiable.
