In this paper, a new identity for differentiable functions is derived. Thus we can obtain new estimates on generalization of Hadamard,Ostrowski and Simpson type inequalities for functions whose derivatives in absolute value at certain power are s-convex (in the second sense). Some applications to special means of real numbers are also given.
