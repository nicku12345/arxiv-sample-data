In this paper, we introduce the notion of (g,\Phi_{h})-convex dominated function and present some properties of them. Finally, we present a version of Hermite-Hadamard-type inequalities for (g,\Phi_{h})-convex dominated functions. Our results generalize the Hermite-Hadamard-type inequalities in [2], [4] and [6].
