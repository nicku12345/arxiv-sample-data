The paper is devoted to the study of limiting behaviour of Besov capacities \capa (E;B_{p,q}^\a) (0<\a<1) of sets in \R^n as \a\to 1 or \a\to 0. Namely, let E\subset \R^n and J_{p,q}(\a, E)=[\a(1-\a)q]^{p/q}\capa(E;B_{p,q}^\a). It is proved that if 1\le p<n, 1\le q<\infty, and the set E is open, then J_{p,q}(\a, E) tends to the Sobolev capacity \capa(E;W_p^1) as \a\to 1. This statement fails to hold for compact sets. Further, it is proved that if the set E is compact and 1\le p,q<\infty, then J_{p,q}(\a, E) tends to 2n^p|E| as \a\to 0 (|E| is the measure of E). For open sets it is not true.
