This is a brief overview of the index hypergeometric transform (other terms for this integral operator are: Olevskii transform, Jacobi transform, generalized Mehler--Fock transform). We discuss applications of this transform to special functions and harmonic analysis. The text is an addendum to the Russian edition of the book by G.E.Andrews, R.Askey, and R.Roy, Special Functions, Encycl. of Math. Appl. 71, Cambridge Univ. Press, 1999.
