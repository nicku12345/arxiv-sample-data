We obtain sharp estimates of the Hardy-Vitali type total p-variation of a function of two variables in terms of its mixed modulus of continuity in L^p([0,1]^2). We also investigate various embeddings for mixed norm spaces of bivariate functions whose linear sections have bounded p-variation in the sense of Wiener
