In this paper, we introduce a new weighted Hardy-Ces\`{a}ro operator defined by U_{\psi,s}f(x)=\int\limits_0^1 f(s(t)\cdot x) \psi(t)dt, which is associated to the parameter curve s(t,x)=s(t)x. Under certain conditions on s(t) and on an absolutely homogeneous weight function \omega, we characterize the weight function \psi such that U_{\psi,s} is bounded on L^p(\omega), BMO(\omega). The corresponding operator norms are worked out too. These results extend the ones of Jie Xiao \cite{xiao}. We also give a sufficient and a necessary condition on the weight function \psi, which ensure the boundedness of the commutators of operator U_{\psi,s} on L^p(\omega) with symbols in BMO(\omega).
