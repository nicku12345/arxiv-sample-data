Two-term recurrence relations are supplied for indefinite integrals of functions that involve factors of the types {P_2}^n, {P_3}^n, {P_4}^n, {P_1}^m {Q_1}^n, E_1 {P_1}^n, {P_1}^m {Q_2}^n, E_1 {P_2}^n, {P_2}^m {Q_2}^n, {P_1}^m {Q_1}^n {S_1}^p, E_1 {P_1}^m {Q_1}^n, {P_1}^m {Q_1}^n {S_2}^p, and {P_1}^m {Q_1}^n {S_1}^p {T_1}^q, where P_i, Q_j, S_k and T_l denote arbitrary polynomials of degree i, j, k and l in the integration variable, E_1 represents the exponential function of an arbitrary linear polynomial in this variable, and m, n, p and q are arbitrary constant exponents. The 136 relations leave the form of an integrand unchanged and increment or decrement the exponents in steps of unity.
