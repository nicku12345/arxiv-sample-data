In this paper we introduce the iterations of the Jacob's ladder and the new type of integral containing certain product of the factors |\zeta|^2 corresponding to the components of some disconnected set of the critical line. Next, we obtain an asymptotic formula for this integral, its factorization and, for example, the essential generalization of two Selberg's formulae (1946).
