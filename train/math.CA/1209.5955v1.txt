In this paper, a fractional version of the Clifford-Fourier transform is introduced, depending on two numerical parameters. A series expansion for the kernel of the resulting integral transform is derived. In the case of even dimension, also an explicit expression for the kernel in terms of Bessel functions is obtained. Finally, the analytic properties of this new integral transform are studied in detail.
