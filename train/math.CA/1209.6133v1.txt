In a previous paper the boundedness properties of Riesz Potentials, Bessel potentials and Fractional Derivatives were studied in detail on Gaussian Besov-Lipschitz spaces B_{p,q}^{\alpha}(\gamma_d). In this paper we will continue our study proving the boundedness of those operators on Gaussian Triebel-Lizorkin spaces F_{p,q}^{\alpha}(\gamma_d). Also these results can be extended to the case of Laguerre or Jacobi expansions and even further to the general framework of diffusions semigroups.
