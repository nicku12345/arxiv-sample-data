We prove that for every integer n\geq 4, the n-linear operator whose symbol is given by a product of two generic symbols of n-linear Hilbert transform type, does not satisfy any L^p estimates similar to those in H\"{o}lder inequality. Then, we extend this result to multi-linear operators whose symbols are given by a product of an arbitrary number of generic symbols of n-linear Hilbert transform kind. As a consequence, under the same assumption n\geq 4,these immediately imply that for any 1< p_1, ..., p_n \leq \infty and 0<p<\infty with 1/p_1 + ... + 1/p_n = 1/p, there exist non-degenerate subspaces \Gamma\subseteq \mathbb{R}^n of maximal dimension n-1, and Mikhlin symbols m singular along \Gamma, for which the associated n-linear multiplier operators T_m do not map L^{p_1}\times ... \times L^{p_n} into L^p. These counterexamples are in sharp contrast with the bi-linear case, where similar operators are known to satisfy many such L^p estimates.
