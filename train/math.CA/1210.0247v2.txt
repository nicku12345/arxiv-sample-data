We study phase portraits of a first order implicit differential equation in a neighborhood of its pleated singular point that is a non-degenerate singular point of the lifted field. Although there is no a visible local classification of implicit differential equations at pleated singular points (even in the topological category), we show that there exist only six essentially different phase portraits, which are presented.
