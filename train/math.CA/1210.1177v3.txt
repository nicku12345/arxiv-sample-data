The structure of orthogonal polynomials on \mathbb{R}^{2} with the weight function | x_{1}^{2}-x_{2}^{2}|^{2k_{0}}| x_{1}x_{2}|^{2k_{1}}e^{-(x_{1}^{2}+x_{2}^{2})/2} is based on the Dunkl operators of type B_{2}. This refers to the full symmetry group of the square, generated by reflections in the lines x_{1}=0 and x_{1}-x_{2}=0. The weight function is integrable if k_{0},k_{1},k_{0}+k_{1}>-\frac{1}{2}. Dunkl operators can be defined for polynomials taking values in a module of the associated reflection group, that is, a vector space on which the group has an irreducible representation. The unique 2-dimensional representation of the group B_{2} is used here. The specific operators for this group and an analysis of the inner products on the harmonic vector-valued polynomials are presented in this paper. An orthogonal basis for the harmonic polynomials is constructed, and is used to define an exponential-type kernel. In contrast to the ordinary scalar case the inner product structure is positive only when (k_{0},k_{1}) satisfy -\frac{1}{2}<k_{0}\pm k_{1}<\frac{1}{2}. For vector polynomials (f_{i})_{i=1}^{2}, (g_{i})_{i=1}^{2} the inner product has the form \iint_{\mathbb{R}^{2}}f(x) K(x) g(x)^{T}e^{-(x_{1}^{2}+x_{2}^{2})/2}dx_{1}dx_{2} where the matrix function K(x) has to satisfy various transformation and boundary conditions. The matrix K is expressed in terms of hypergeometric functions.
