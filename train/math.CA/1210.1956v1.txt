Let \mu_n be a sequence of discrete measures on the unit \ZT=\ZR/\ZZ with \mu_n(0)=0, and \mu_n((-\delta,\delta))\to 1, as n\to\infty. We prove that the sequence of convolution operators (f\ast\mu_n)(x) is strong sweeping out, i.e. there exists a set E\subset\ZT such that \md0 \lim\sup_{n\to\infty}(\ZI_E\ast\mu_n)(x)= 1,\quad \lim\inf_{n\to\infty}(\ZI_E\ast\mu_n)(x)= 0, \emd almost everywhere on \ZT.
