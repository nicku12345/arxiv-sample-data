In the framework of Clifford analysis, a chain of harmonic and monogenic potentials in the upper half of Euclidean space \mR^{m+1} was recently constructed, including a higher dimensional analogue of the logarithmic function in the complex plane. In this construction the distributional limits of these potentials at the boundary \mR^{m} are crucial. The remarkable relationship between these distributional boundary values and four basic pseudodifferential operators linked with the Dirac and Laplace operators is studied.
