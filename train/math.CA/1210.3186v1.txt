Let \Gamma be a graph. Under suitable geometric assumptions on \Gamma, we give several equivalent characterizations of Sobolev and Hardy-Sobolev spaces on \Gamma, in terms of maximal functionals, Haj{\l} asz type functionals or atomic decompositions. As an application, we study the boundedness of Riesz transforms on Hardy spaces on \Gamma. This gives the discrete counterpart of the corresponding results on Riemannian manifolds.
