The paper has been withdrawn by the author. The main inequalities of trigonometric approximation are proved in Lebesgue spaces with A_{\infty} weights. Here Jackson-Stechkin type direct theorem, its weak converse and a realization result are obtained with respect to a fractional order moduli of smoothness. We improved the Jackson inequalities for several ways. We find the exact constant of Jackson-Stechkin inequality for p=2.
