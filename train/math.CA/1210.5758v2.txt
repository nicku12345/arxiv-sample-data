More than 80 years ago Kolmogorov asked the following question. Let E\subseteq \mathbb{R}^{2} be a measurable set with \lambda^{2}(E)<\infty, where \lambda^2 denotes the two-dimensional Lebesgue measure. Does there exist for every \varepsilon>0 a contraction f\colon E\to \mathbb{R}^{2} such that \lambda^{2}(f(E))\geq \lambda^{2}(E)-\varepsilon and f(E) is a polygon? We answer this question in the negative by constructing a bounded, simply connected open counterexample. Our construction can easily be modified to yield the analogous result in higher dimensions.
