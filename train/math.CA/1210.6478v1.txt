For a,b>0 with a\neq b, we define M_{p}=M^{1/p}(a^{p},b^{p})\text{if}p\neq 0 \text{and} M_{0}=\sqrt{ab}, where M=A,He,L,I,P,T,N,Z and Y stand for the arithmetic mean, Heronian mean, logarithmic mean, identric (exponential) mean, the first Seiffert mean, the second Seiffert mean, Neuman-S\'{a}ndor mean, power-exponential mean and exponential-geometric mean, respectively. Generally, if M is a mean of a and b, then M_{p} is also, and call "power-type mean". We prove the power-type means P_{p}, T_{p}, N_{p}, Z_{p} are increasing in p on \mathbb{R} and establish sharp inequalities among power-type means A_{p}, He_{p}, L_{p}, I_{p}, P_{p}, N_{p}, Z_{p}, Y_{p}% . From this a very nice chain of inequalities for these means L_{2}<P<N_{1/2}<He<A_{2/3}<I<Z_{1/3}<Y_{1/2} follows. Lastly, a conjecture is proposed.
