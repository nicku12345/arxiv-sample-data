We study the fractal oscillatority of a class of real C^1 functions x=x(t) near t=\infty. It is measured by oscillatory and phase dimensions, defined as box dimensions of the graph of X(\tau)=x(\frac{1}{\tau}) near \tau=0 and the trajectory (x,\dot{x}) in \mathbb{R}^2, respectively, assuming that (x,\dot{x}) is a spiral converging to the origin. The relationship between these two dimensions has been established for a class of oscillatory functions using formulas for box dimensions of graphs of chirps and nonrectifiable wavy spirals, introduced in this paper. Wavy spirals are a specific type of spirals, given in polar coordinates by r=f(\varphi), converging to the origin in non-monotone way as a function of \varphi. They emerged in our study of phase portraits associated to solutions of Bessel equations. Also, the rectifiable chirps and spirals have been studied.
