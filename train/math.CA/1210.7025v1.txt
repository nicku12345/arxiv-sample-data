We consider \ell^r extensions of Calderon-Zygmund operators on weighted spaces L^p(w) with w an A_p weight and 1 < p < \infty. We give quantitative estimates of these operators' norm in terms of a given weight's A_p characteristic. In particular, using a decomposition theorem of A. Lerner, we show that these extensions recover certain scalar estimates. Related results on general Banach spaces have been studied by Hytonen and Hannien.
