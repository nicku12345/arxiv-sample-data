In this paper we establish different representations of the so-called Yor integral, which is one of the key ingredient in mathematical finance, in particular, to compute normalized prices of Asian options. We show, that the Yor integral is related with the Kontorovich-Lebedev transform. Also we discuss its relationship with a system of polynomials recently introduced by the author. We derive new important properties of these polynomials, including upper bounds, an exact asymptotic behavior for large values of their degree and explicit formula of coefficients.
