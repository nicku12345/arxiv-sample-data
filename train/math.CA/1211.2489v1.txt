For the weight function W_\mu(x) = (1-|x|^2)^\mu, \mu > -1, \lambda > 0 and b_\mu a normalizing constant, a family of mutually orthogonal polynomials on the unit ball with respect to the inner product    \la f,g \ra = {b_\mu [\int_{\BB^d} f(x) g(x) W_\mu(x) dx +   \lambda \int_{\BB^d} \nabla f(x) \cdot \nabla g(x) W_\mu(x) dx]}  are constructed in terms of spherical harmonics and a sequence of Sobolev orthog onal polynomials of one variable. The latter ones, hence, the orthogonal polynomials with respect to \la \cdot,\cdot\ra, can be generated through a recursive formula.
