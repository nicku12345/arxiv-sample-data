A strong version of the Orlicz maximal operator is introduced and a natural B_p condition for the rectangle case is defined to characterize its boundedness. This fact let us to describe a sufficient condition for the two weight inequalities of the strong maximal function in terms of power and logarithmic bumps. Results for the multilinear version of this operator and for others multi(sub)linear maximal functions associated with bases of open sets are also studied.
