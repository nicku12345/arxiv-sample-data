We show that if E \i \R^n is a Reifenberg flat set E of dimension d at scale r_0, we can find a smooth surface \Sigma_0 of dimension d which is close to E at the scale r_0. When E is a Reifenberg flat set, this allows us to apply a result of G. David and T. Toro [Memoirs of the AMS 215 (2012), 1012], and get a bi-H\"older homeomorphism of \R^n that sends \Sigma_0 to E. If in addition d=n-1 and E is compact and connected, then \Sigma_0 is orientable, and \R^n \sm E has exactly two connected components, which we can approximate from the inside by smooth domains.
