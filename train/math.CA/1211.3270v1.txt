We derive an integral representation for the Jacobi-Poisson kernel valid for all admissible type parameters \alpha,\beta in the context of Jacobi expansions. This enables us to develop a technique for proving standard estimates in the Jacobi setting, which works for all possible \alpha and \beta. As a consequence, we can prove that several fundamental operators in the harmonic analysis of Jacobi expansions are (vector-valued) Calder\'on-Zygmund operators in the sense of the associated space of homogeneous type, and hence their mapping properties follow from the general theory. The new Jacobi-Poisson kernel representation also leads to sharp estimates of this kernel. The paper generalizes methods and results existing in the literature, but valid or justified only for a restricted range of \alpha and \beta.
