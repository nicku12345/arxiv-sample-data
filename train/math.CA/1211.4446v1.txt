For a periodic function f with bounded variation and integral zero on its period interval, we show that \sum_{k=1}^\infty c_k^2 (\log\log k)^\gamma <\infty, \gamma>4 implies the almost everywhere convergence of \sum_{k=1}^\infty c_k f(n_kx) for any increasing sequence (n_k) of integers. We also construct an example showing that the previous condition is not sufficient for \gamma<2. Finally we give an a.e. bound for the growth of sums \sum_{k=1}^N f(n_kx) differing from the corresponding optimal result for trigonometric sums by a loglog factor.
