In this paper, approximate convexity and approximate midconvexity properties, called \varphi-convexity and \varphi-midconvexity, of real valued function are investigated. Various characterizations of \varphi-convex and \varphi-midconvex functions are obtained. Furthermore, the relationship between \varphi-midconvexity and \varphi-convexity is established.
