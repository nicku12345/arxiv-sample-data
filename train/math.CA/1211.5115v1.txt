In this paper we prove some sharp weighted norm inequalities for the multi(sub)linear maximal function \Mm introduced in \cite{LOPTT} and for multilinear Calder\'on-Zygmund operators. In particular we obtain a sharp mixed "A_p-A_{\infty}" bound for \Mm, some partial results related to a Buckley-type estimate for \Mm, and a sufficient condition for the boundedness of \Mm between weighted L^p spaces with different weights taking into account the precise bounds.   Next we get a bound for multilinear Calder\'on-Zygmund operators in terms of dyadic positive multilinear operators in the spirit of the recent work. Then we obtain a multilinear version of the "A_2 conjecture". Several open problems are posed.
