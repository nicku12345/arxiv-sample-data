In this work, we describe several results exhibited during a talk at the El Escorial 2012 conference. We aim to pursue the development of a multi-frequency Calderon-Zygmund analysis introduced in [9]. We set a definition of general multi-frequency Calderon-Zygmund operator. Unweighted estimates are obtained using the corresponding multi-frequency decomposition of [9]. Involving a new kind of maximal sharp function, weighted estimates are obtained.
