The classical Stokes matrices for the quantum differential equation of projective n-space are computed, using multisummation and the so-called monodromy identity. Thus, we recover the results of D. Guzzetti that confirm Dubrovin's conjecture for projective spaces. The same method yields explicit formulas for the Stokes matrices of the quantum differential equations of smooth Fano hypersurfaces in projective n-space and for weighted projective spaces.
