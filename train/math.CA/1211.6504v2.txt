We give an extension to a nonconvex setting of the classical radial representation result for lower semicontinuous envelope of a convex function on the boundary of its effective domain. We introduce the concept of radial uniform upper semicontinuity which plays the role of convexity, and allows to prove a radial representation result for nonconvex functions. An application to the relaxation of multiple integrals with constraints on the gradient is given.
