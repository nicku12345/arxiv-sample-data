We develop the theory of variable exponent Hardy spaces. Analogous to the classical theory, we give equivalent definitions in terms of maximal operators. We also show that distributions in these spaces have an atomic decomposition including a "finite" decomposition; this decomposition is more like the decomposition for weighted Hardy spaces due to Stromberg and Torchinsky than the classical atomic decomposition. As an application of the atomic decomposition we show that singular integral operators are bounded on variable Hardy spaces with minimal regularity assumptions on the exponent function.
