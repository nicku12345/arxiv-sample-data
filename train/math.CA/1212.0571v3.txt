We establish several mixed A_p-A_\infty bounds for Calder\'on-Zygmund operators that only involve one supremum. We address both cases when the A_\infty part of the constant is measured using the exponential-logarithmic definition and using the Fujii-Wilson definition. In particular, we answer a question of the first author and provide an answer, up to a logarithmic factor, of a conjecture of Hyt\"onen and Lacey. Moreover, we give an example to show that our bounds with the logarithmic factors can be arbitrarily smaller than the previously known bounds (both one supremum and two suprema).
