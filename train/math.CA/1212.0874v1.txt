In this paper, the connection between the functional inequalities  f\Big(\frac{x+y}{2}\Big)\leq\frac{f(x)+f(y)}{2}+\alpha_J(x-y) \qquad (x,y\in D) and  \int_0^1f\big(tx+(1-t)y\big)\rho(t)dt \leq\lambda f(x)+(1-\lambda)f(y) +\alpha_H(x-y) \qquad (x,y\in D) is investigated, where D is a convex subset of a linear space, f:D\to\R, \alpha_H,\alpha_J:D-D\to\R are even functions, \lambda\in[0,1], and \rho:[0,1]\to\R_+ is an integrable nonnegative function with \int_0^1\rho(t)dt=1.
