In this paper, strongly (\alpha,T)-convex functions, i.e., functions f:D\to \R satisfying the functional inequality  f(tx+(1-t)y)\leq tf(x)+(1-t)f(y)-t\alpha\big((1-t)(x-y)\big)-(1-t)\alpha\big(t(y-x)\big) for x,y\in D and t\in T\cap[0,1] are investigated. Here D is a convex set in a linear space, \alpha is a nonnegative function on D-D, and T\subseteq\R is a nonempty set. The main results provide various characterizations of strong (\alpha,T)-convexity in the case when T is a subfield of \R.
