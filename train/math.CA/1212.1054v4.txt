We investigate the weighted bounds for multilinear maximal functions and Calder\'on-Zygmund operators from L^{p_1}(w_1)\times...\times L^{p_m}(w_m) to L^{p}(v_{\vec{w}}), where 1<p_1,...,p_m<\infty with 1/{p_1}+...+1/{p_m}=1/p and \vec{w} is a multiple A_{\vec{P}} weight. We prove the sharp bound for the multilinear maximal function for all such p_1,..., p_m and prove the sharp bound for m-linear Calder\'on-Zymund operators when p\geq 1.
