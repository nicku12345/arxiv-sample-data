In this paper a weighted variable exponent Lebesgue spaces L_{p(x), \omega} for 0< p(x)< 1 is investigated. We show that this spaces is a quasi-Banach spaces. Note that embedding theorem between weight variable Lebesgue spaces is proved. In particular, we show that L_{p(x), \omega}(\Omega) for 0< p(x)< 1 isn't locally convex. Also, in this paper a some two-weight estimates for Hardy operator are proved.
