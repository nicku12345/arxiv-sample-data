In the framework of Clifford analysis, a chain of harmonic and monogenic potentials in the upper half of Euclidean space R^{m+1} was constructed recently, including a higher dimensional analogue of the logarithmic function in the complex plane. Their distributional limits at the boundary R^{m} were also determined. In this paper the potentials and their distributional boundary values are calculated in dimensions 3 and 4, dimensions for which the expressions in general dimension break down.
