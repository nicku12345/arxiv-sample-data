We obtain asymptotic estimates for the best approximations by trigonometric polynomials in the metric space C (L_p) of classes of periodic functions that can be represented as a convolution of kernels \Psi_\beta, which Fourier coefficients tend to zero faster than any power sequence, with functions \varphi\in C (\varphi\in L_p), which moduli of continuity do not exceed a fixed majorant \omega(t). It is proved that in the spaces C and L_1 the obtained estimates are asymptotically exact for convex moduli of continuity \omega(t).
