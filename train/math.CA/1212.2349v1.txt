Related to a semigroup of operators on a metric measure space, we define and study pseudodifferential operators (including the setting of Riemannian manifold, fractals, graphs ...). Boundedness on L^p for pseudodifferential operators of order 0 are proved. Mainly, we focus on symbols belonging to the class S^0_{1,\delta} for \delta\in[0,1). For the limit class S^0_{1,1}, we describe some results by restricting our attention to the case of a sub-Laplacian operator on a Riemannian manifold.
