We prove that the Poisson kernel P_{q,\beta}(t)=\sum\limits_{k=1}^{\infty}q^k\cos(kt-\dfrac{\beta\pi}{2}), {q\in(0,1)}, \beta\in\mathbb{R}, satisfies Kushpel's condition C_{y,2n} beginning with a number n_q where n_q is the smallest number n\geq9, for which the following inequality is satisfied:    \dfrac{43}{10(1-q)}q^{\sqrt{n}}+\dfrac{160}{57(n-\sqrt{n})}\; \dfrac{q}{(1-q)^2}\leq (\dfrac{1}{2}+\dfrac{2q}{(1+q^2)(1-q)})(\dfrac{1-q}{1+q})^{\frac {4}{1-q^2}}.    As a consequence, for all n\geq n_q we obtain lower bounds for Kolmogorov widths in the space C of classes C_{\beta,\infty}^q of Poisson integrals of functions that belong to the unit ball in the space L_\infty. The obtained estimates coincide with the best uniform approximations by trigonometric polynomials for these classes. As a result, we obtain exact values for widths of classes C_{\beta,\infty}^q and show that subspaces of trigonometric polynomials of order n-1 are optimal for widths of dimension 2n.
