We give a necessary and sufficient mean condition for the quotient of two Jensen functionals and define a new class \Lambda_{f,g}(a, b) of mean values where f, g are continuously differentiable convex functions satisfying the relation f"(t)=t g"(t), t\in \Bbb R^+. Then we asked for a characterization of f, g such that the inequalities H(a, b)\le \Lambda_{f, g}(a, b)\le A(a, b) or L(a, b)\le \Lambda_{f, g}(a, b)\le I(a, b) hold for each positive a, b, where H, A, L, I are the harmonic, arithmetic, logarithmic and identric means, respectively. For a subclass of \Lambda with g"(t)=t^s, s\in \Bbb R, this problem is thoroughly solved.
