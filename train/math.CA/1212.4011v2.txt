In this paper, we study the weighted estimates for multilinear Calder\'{o}n-Zygmund operators %with multiple A_{\vec{P}} weights from L^{p_1}(w_1)\times...\times L^{p_m}(w_m) to L^{p}(v_{\vec{w}}), where 1<p, p_1,...,p_m<\infty with 1/{p_1}+...+1/{p_m}=1/p and \vec{w}=(w_1,...,w_m) is a multiple A_{\vec{P}} weight. We give weak and strong type weighted estimates of mixed A_p-A_\infty type. Moreover, the strong type weighted estimate is sharp whenever \max_i p_i \le p'/(mp-1).
