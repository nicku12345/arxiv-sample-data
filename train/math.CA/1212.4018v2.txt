Motivated by the problem of spherical summability of products of Fourier series, we study the boundedness of the bilinear Bochner-Riesz multipliers (1-|\xi|^2-|\eta|^2)^\delta_+ and we make some advances in this investigation. We obtain an optimal result concerning the boundedness of these means from L^2\times L^2  into L^1 with minimal smoothness, i.e., any \delta>0, and we obtain estimates for other pairs of spaces for larger values of \delta. Our study is broad enough to encompass general bilinear multipliers m(\xi,\eta) radial in \xi and \eta with minimal smoothness, measured in Sobolev space norms. Our results are based on a variety of techniques, that include Fourier series expansions, orthogonality, and bilinear restriction and extension theorems.
