Let (P_n)_n and (Q_n)_n be two sequences of monic polynomials linked by a type structure relation such as  Q_{n}(x)+r_nQ_{n-1}(x)=P_{n}(x)+s_nP_{n-1}(x)+t_nP_{n-2}(x)\;,  where (r_n)_n, (s_n)_n and (t_n)_n are sequences of complex numbers.   First, we state necessary and sufficient conditions on the parameters such that the above relation becomes non-degenerate when both sequences (P_n)_n and (Q_n)_n are orthogonal with respect to regular moment linear functionals {\bf u} and {\bf v}, respectively.   Second, assuming that the above relation is non-degenerate and (P_n)_n is an orthogonal sequence, we obtain a characterization for the orthogonality of the sequence (Q_n)_n in terms of the coefficients of the polynomials \Phi and \Psi which appear in the rational transformation (in the distributional sense) \Phi {\bf u}=\Psi {\bf v}\; .   Some illustrative examples of the developed theory are presented.
