We prove that the inequalities \sin_{p,q}(\sqrt{rs})\geq \sqrt{\sin_{p,q}(r)\sin_{p,q}(s)} and \sinh_{p,q}(\sqrt{r^*s^*}) \leq \sqrt{\sinh_{p,q}(r^*)\sinh_{p,q}(s^*)} hold for all p,q\in(1,\infty), r,s\in(0,\int_{0}^{1}(1-t^q)^{-1/p}dt) and r^*,s^*\in(0,\int_{0}^{\infty}(1+t^q)^{-1/p}dt), where \sin_{p,q} and \sinh_{p,q} are the generalized trigonometric and hyperbolic sine functions, respectively. As a consequence of the results, we prove a conjecture due to Bhayo and Vuorinen [J. Approx. Theory, 164(2012)].
