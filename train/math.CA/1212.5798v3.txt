This paper deals with the existence of asymptotic almost automorphic solution of fractional integro differential equation. We prove the result by using fixed point theorems. We show the result with Lipschitz condition and without Lipschitz condition on the forcing term. At the end examples have been given to illustrate the analytical findings.
