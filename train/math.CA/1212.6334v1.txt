The main purpose of this short note is to present an adaptation of the multilinear Bellman function technique from [4] to the time-frequency analysis. Demeter and Thiele introduced the two-dimensional bilinear Hilbert transform in [3] and showed that the Carleson operator can be identified in particular instances of the corresponding trilinear form. Demeter considered the Walsh model of one such form in [2], in relation to the discussion of the Walsh-Carleson theorem. We prove boundedness of this trilinear form for a single triple of exponents at the boundary of the previously established range.
