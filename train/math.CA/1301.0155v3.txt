Let \psi_q(x), \psi_q'(x), and \psi_q''(x) for q>0 stand respectively for the q-digamma, q-trigamma, and q-tetragamma functions. In the paper, the author proves along two different approaches that the functions [\psi'_q(x)]^2+\psi''_q(x) for q>1 and [\psi_{q}'(x)-\ln q]^2 +\psi''_{q}(x) for 0<q<1 are completely monotonic on (0,\infty). Applying these results, the author derives monotonic properties of four functions involving the q-digamma function \psi_q(x) and two double inequalities for bounding the q-digamma function \psi_q(x).
