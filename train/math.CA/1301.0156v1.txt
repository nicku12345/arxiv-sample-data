The psi function \psi(x) is defined by \psi(x)=\frac{\Gamma'(x)}{\Gamma(x)} and \psi^{(i)}(x) for i\in\mathbb{N} denote polygamma functions, where \Gamma(x) is the gamma function. In this paper, we prove that the function  [\psi'(x)]^2+\psi"(x)-\frac{x^2+\lambda x+12}{12x^4(x+1)^2}  is completely monotonic on (0,\infty) if and only if \lambda\le0, and so is its negative if and only if \lambda\ge4. From this, some inequalities are refined and sharpened.
