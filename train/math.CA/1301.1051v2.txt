Let S_{\a,\psi}(f) be the square function defined by means of the cone in {\mathbb R}^{n+1}_{+} of aperture \a, and a standard kernel \psi. Let [w]_{A_p} denote the A_p characteristic of the weight w. We show that for any 1<p<\infty and \a\ge 1, \|S_{\a,\psi}\|_{L^p(w)}\lesssim \a^n[w]_{A_p}^{\max(1/2,\frac{1}{p-1})}. For each fixed \a the dependence on [w]_{A_p} is sharp. Also, on all class A_p the result is sharp in \a. Previously this estimate was proved in the case \a=1 using the intrinsic square function. However, that approach does not allow to get the above estimate with sharp dependence on \a. Hence we give a different proof suitable for all \a\ge 1 and avoiding the notion of the intrinsic square function.
