The Kamp\'{e} de F\'{e}riet double series F_{1:1;1}^{1:1;1} is studied through the solution to the associated first-order nonhomogeneous differential equation. It is shown that the integral of t^{\beta+l}M(\cdot;\beta;\lambda t)M(\cdot;\beta;-\lambda t) over t\in[0,T], T\geq0, l=0,1,\ldots, \Re\beta+l>-1, is a linear combination of functions F_{1:1;1}^{1:1;1}. The integral is a generalization of a class of so-called Coulomb integrals involving regular Coulomb wave functions.
