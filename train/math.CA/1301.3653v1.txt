In this paper higher-order tangent numbers and higher-order secant numbers, {\mathscr{T}(n,k)}_{n,k =0}^{\infty} and {\mathscr{S}(n,k)}_{n,k =0}^{\infty}, have been studied in detail. Several known results regarding \mathscr{T}(n,k) and \mathscr{S}(n,k) have been brought together along with many new results and insights and they all have been proved in a simple and unified manner. In particular, it is shown that the higher-order tangent numbers \mathscr{T}(n,k) constitute a special class of the partial multivariate Bell polynomials and that \mathscr{S}(n,k) can be computed from the knowledge of \mathscr{T}(n,k). In addition, a simple explicit formula involving a double finite sum is deduced for the numbers \mathscr{T}(n,k) and it is shown that \mathscr{T}(n,k) are linear combinations of the classical tangent numbers T_n.
