A new explicit closed-form formula for the multivariate (n, k)th partial Bell polynomial B_{n,k} (x_1, x_2, ..., x_{n - k + 1}) is deduced. The formula involves multiple summations and makes it possible, for the first time, to easily evaluate B_{n,k} directly for given values of n and k (n\geq k, k =2, 3,...). Also, a new addition formula (with respect to k) is found for the polynomials B_{n,k} and it is shown that they admit a new recurrence relation. Several special cases and consequences are pointed out, and some examples are also given.
