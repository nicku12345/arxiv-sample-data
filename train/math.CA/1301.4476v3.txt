In 1981, Andrews gave a four-variable generalization of Ramanujan's {_1\psi_1} summation formula. We establish a six-variable generalization of Andrews' identity according to the transformation formula for two {_8\phi_7} series and Bailey's transformation formula for three {_8\phi_7} series. Then it is used to find a six-variable generalization of Ramanujan's reciprocity theorem, which is different from Liu's formula. We derive the generalizations of Bailey's two _3\psi_3 summation formulas in terms of two limiting relations and Bailey's another transformation formula for three _8\phi_7 series. Based on the two limiting relations, some different results involving bilateral basic hypergeometric series are also deduced from the Guo--Schlosser transformation formula and other two transformation formulas.
