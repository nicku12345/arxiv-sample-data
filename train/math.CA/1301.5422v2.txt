In this paper our aim is to deduce some complete monotonicity properties and functional inequalities for the Bickley function. The key tools in our proofs are the classical integral inequalities, like Chebyshev, H\"older-Rogers, Cauchy-Schwarz, Carlson and Gr\"uss inequalities, as well as the monotone form of l'Hospital's rule. Moreover, we prove the complete monotonicity of a determinant function of which entries involve the Bickley function.
