In this paper, by using a general result on the monotonicity of quotients of power series, our aim is to prove some monotonicity and convexity results for the modified Struve functions. Moreover, as consequences of the above mentioned results, we present some functional inequalities as well as lower and upper bounds for modified Struve functions. Our main results complement and improve the results of Joshi and Nalwaya [11].
