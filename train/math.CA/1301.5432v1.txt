It is known that Struve function \mathbf H_\nu and modified Struve function \mathbf L_\nu are closely connected to Bessel function of the first kind J_\nu and to modified Bessel function of the first kind I_\nu and possess representations through higher transcendental functions like generalized hypergeometric {}_1F_2 and Meijer G function. Also, the NIST project and Wolfram formula collection contain a set of Kapteyn type series expansions for \mathbf L_\nu(x). In this paper firstly, we obtain various another type integral representation formulae for \mathbf L_\nu(x) using the technique developed by D. Jankov and the authors. Secondly, we present some summation results for different kind of Neumann, Kapteyn and Schl\"omilch series built by I_\nu(x) and \mathbf L_\nu(x) which are connected by a Sonin--Gubler formula, and by the associated modified Struve differential equation. Finally, solving a Fredholm type convolutional integral equation of the first kind, Bromwich--Wagner line integral expressions are derived for the Bessel function of the first kind J_\nu and for an associated generalized Schl\"omilch series.
