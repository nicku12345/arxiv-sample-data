In this paper our aim is to prove some monotonicity and convexity results for the modified Struve function of the second kind by using its integral representation. Moreover, as consequences of these results, we present some functional inequalities (like Tur\'an type inequalities) as well as lower and upper bounds for modified Struve function of the second kind and its logarithmic derivative.
