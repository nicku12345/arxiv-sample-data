We provide an alternative proof of a (local) T1 theorem for dual exponents in the non-homogeneous setting of upper doubling measures. This previously known theorem provides necessary and sufficient conditions for the L^p-boundedness of Calder\'on-Zygmund operators in the described setting, and the novelty lies in the method of proof.
