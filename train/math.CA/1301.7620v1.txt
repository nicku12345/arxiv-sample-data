There were established the exact-order estimations of the best uniform approximations by{\psi} the trigonometrical polynoms on the C^{\psi}_{\beta,p} classes of 2\pi-periodic continuous functions f, which are defined by the convolutions of the functions, which belong to the unit ball in L_p, 1\leq p <\infty spaces with generating fixed kernels \Psi_{\beta}\subset|L_{p'}, \frac{1}{p}+\frac{1}{p'}=1, whose Fourier coeficients decreasing to zero approximately as power functions. The exact order estimations were also established in L_p-metrics, 1 < p \leq\infty for L^{\psi}_{\beta,1} classes of 2\pi-periodic functions f, which are equivalent by means of Lebesque measure to the convolutions of \Psi_{\beta}\subset|L_{p} kernels with the functions that belong to the unit ball in L_1 space. We showed that in investigating cases the orders of best approximations are realized by Fourier sums.
