The purpose of this article is to present, in a simple way, an analytic approach to special numbers and polynomials. The approach is based on the derivative polynomials. The paper is, to some extent, a review article, although it contains some new elements. In particular, it seems that some integral representations for Bernoulli numbers and Bernoulli polynomials can be seen as new.
