This is a sequel to [SIGMA 9 (2013), 007, 23 pages, arXiv:1210.1177], in which there is a construction of a 2\times2 positive-definite matrix function K (x) on \mathbb{R}^{2}. The entries of K(x) are expressed in terms of hypergeometric functions. This matrix is used in the formula for a Gaussian inner product related to the standard module of the rational Cherednik algebra for the group W(B_2) (symmetry group of the square) associated to the (2-dimensional) reflection representation. The algebra has two parameters: k_{0}, k_{1}. In the previous paper K is determined up to a scalar, namely, the normalization constant. The conjecture stated there is proven in this note. An asymptotic formula for a sum of _{3}F_{2}-type is derived and used for the proof.
