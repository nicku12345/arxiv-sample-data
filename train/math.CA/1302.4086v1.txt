We prove a version of both Jacobi's and Montel's Theorems for the case of continuous functions defined over the field \mathbb{Q}_p of p-adic numbers. In particular, we prove that, if \[ \Delta_{h_0}^{m+1}f(x)=0 \ \ \text{for all} x\in\mathbb{Q}_p, \] and |h_0|_p=p^{-N_0} then, for all x_0\in \mathbb{Q}_p, the restriction of f over the set x_0+p^{N_0}\mathbb{Z}_p coincides with a polynomial p_{x_0}(x)=a_0(x_0)+a_1(x_0)x+...+a_m(x_0)x^m. Motivated by this result, we compute the general solution of the functional equation with restrictions given by {equation} \Delta_h^{m+1}f(x)=0 \ \ (x\in X \text{and} h\in B_X(r)=\{x\in X:\|x\|\leq r\}), {equation} whenever f:X\to Y, X is an ultrametric normed space over a non-Archimedean valued field (\mathbb{K},|...|) of characteristic zero, and Y is a \mathbb{Q}-vector space. By obvious reasons, we call these functions uniformly locally polynomial.
