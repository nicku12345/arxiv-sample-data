It is known that the elementary symmetric polynomials e_k(x) have the property that if  x, y \in [0,\infty)^n and e_k(x) \leq e_k(y) for all k, then ||x||_p \leq ||y||_p for all real 0\leq p \leq 1, and moreover ||x||_p \geq ||y||_p for 1\leq p \leq 2 provided ||x||_1 =||y||_1. Previously the author proved this kind of property for p>2, for certain polynomials F_{k,r}(x) which generalize the e_k(x). In this paper we give two additional generalizations of this type, involving two other families of polynomials. When x consists of the eigenvalues of a matrix A, we give a formula for the polynomials in terms of the entries of A, generalizing sums of principal k \times k subdeterminants.
