The aim of this paper is to employ variational techniques and critical point theory to prove some conditions for the existence of solutions to nonlinear impulsive dynamic equation with homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions. Also we will be interested in the solutions of the impulsive nonlinear problem with linear derivative dependence satisfying an impulsive condition.
