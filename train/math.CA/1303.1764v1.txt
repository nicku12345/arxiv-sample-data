A known Hardy-Littlewood theorem asserts that if both the function and its conjugate are of bounded variation, then their Fourier series are absolutely convergent. It is proved in the paper that the same result holds true for functions on the whole axis and their Fourier transforms with certain adjustments. The proof of the original Hardy-Littlewood theorem is derived from the obtained assertion. It turned out that the former is a partial case of the latter when the function is supposed to be of compact support. A similar result as the obtained one but for radial functions is derived from the one-dimensional case.
