This paper is concerned with the cyclicity of the period annulus of quadratic Hamiltonian triangle vector field under quadratic perturbations. This problem has been studied by Iliev (J. Differential Equations {\bf 128}(1996)), based on the displacement function obtained by \.{Z}o{\l}adek (J. Differential Equations {\bf 109}(1994)). Recently, P. Marde\v{s}i\'{c} etc. (J. Dynamical and Control Systems {\bf 17}(2011)) studied unfoldings of the Hamiltonian triangle within quadratic vector fields. It turned out that the displacement function is not precise of the form given by \.{Z}o{\l}adek. Using the corrected form of the displacement function obtained by P. Marde\v{s}i\'{c} etc, it is proved in this paper that the cyclicity of the period annulus under quadratic perturbations is equal to three.
