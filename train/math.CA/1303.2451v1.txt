In the paper, the authors discover the best constants \alpha_{1}, \alpha_{2}, \beta_{1}, and \beta_{2} for the double inequalities  \alpha_{1}\bar{C}(a,b)+(1-\alpha_{1}) A(a,b)< T(a,b) <\beta_{1} \bar{C}(a,b)+(1-\beta_{1})A(a,b)  and  \frac{\alpha_{2}}{A(a,b)}+\frac{1-\alpha_{2}}{\bar{C}(a,b)}<\frac1{T(a,b)} <\frac{\beta_{2}}{A(a,b)}+\frac{1-\beta_{2}}{\bar{C}(a,b)}  to be valid for all a,b>0 with a\ne b, where  \bar{C}(a,b)=\frac{2(a^{2}+ab+b^{2})}{3(a+b)},\quad A(a,b)=\frac{a+b}2,  and  T(a,b)=\frac{2}{\pi}\int_{0}^{{\pi}/{2}}\sqrt{a^2{\cos^2{\theta}}+b^2{\sin^2{\theta}}}\,\td\theta  are respectively the centroidal, arithmetic, and Toader means of two positive numbers a and b. As an application of the above inequalities, the authors also find some new bounds for the complete elliptic integral of the second kind.
