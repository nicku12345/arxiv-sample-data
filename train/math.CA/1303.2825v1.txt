This paper is a short introduction to orthogonal polynomials, both the general theory and some special classes. It ends with some remarks about the usage of computer algebra for this theory. The paper will appear as a chapter in the book "Computer Algebra in Quantum Field Theory: Integration, Summation and Special Functions", Springer-Verlag.
