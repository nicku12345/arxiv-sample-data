An alternative proof of Lie's approach for linearization of scalar second order ODEs is derived using the relationship between \lambda-symmetries and first integrals. This relation further leads to a new \lambda-symmetry linearization criteria for second order ODEs which provides a new approach for constructing the linearization transformations with lower complexity. The effectiveness of the approach is illustrated by obtaining the local linearization transformations for the linearizable nonlinear ODEs of the form y''+F_1(x,y)y'+F(x,y)=0. Examples of linearizing nonlinear ODEs which are quadratic or cubic in the first derivative are also presented.
