In this paper we consider square functions (also called Littlewood-Paley g-functions) associated to Hankel convolutions acting on functions in the Bochner-Lebesgue space L^p((0,\infty),B), where B is a UMD Banach space. As special cases we study square functions defined by fractional derivatives of the Poisson semigroup for the Bessel operator \Delta_\lambda=-x^{-\lambda}\frac{d}{dx}x^{2\lambda}\frac{d}{dx}x^{-\lambda}, \lambda >0. We characterize the UMD property for a Banach space B by using L^p((0,\infty),B)-boundedness properties of g-functions defined by Bessel-Poisson semigroups. As a by product we prove that the fact that the imaginary power \Delta_\lambda ^{iw}, w\in \mathbb{R}\setminus\{0\}, of the Bessel operator \Delta_\lambda is bounded in L^p ((0,\infty),B), 1<p<\infty, characterizes the UMD property for the Banach space B. As applications of our results for square functions we establish the boundedness in L^p((0,\infty),B) of spectral multipliers m(\Delta_\lambda) of Bessel operators defined by functions m which are holomorphic in sectors \Sigma_\vartheta.
