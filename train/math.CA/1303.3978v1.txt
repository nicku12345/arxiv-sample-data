In this article we examine the densities of a product and a ratio of two real positive scalar random variables x_1 and x_2, which are statistically independently distributed, and we consider the density of the product u_1=x_1x_2 as well as the density of the ratio u_2={{x_2}\over{x_1}} and show that Kober operator of the second kind is available as the density of u_1 and Kober operator of the first kind is available as the density of u_2 when x_1 has a type-1 beta density and x_2 has an arbitrary density. We also give interpretations of Kober operators of the second and first kind as Mellin convolution for a product and ratio respectively. Then we look at various types of generalizations of the idea thereby obtaining a large collection of operators which can all be called generalized Kober operators. One of the generalizations considered is the pathway idea where one can move from one family of operators to another family and yet another family and eventually end up with an exponential form. Common generalizations in terms of a Gauss' hypergeometric series is also given a statistical interpretation and put on a more general structure so that the standard generalizations given by various authors, including Saigo operators, are given statistical interpretations and are derivable as special cases of the general structure considered in this article.
