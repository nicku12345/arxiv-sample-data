In the preceding articles we considered fractional integral transforms involving one real scalar variable, one real matrix variable and real scalar multivariable case. In the present paper we consider the multivariable case when the arbitrary function is a real-valued scalar function of many p\times p real matrix variables X_1,...,X_k. Extension of all standard fractional integral operators to the cases of many matrix variables is considered, along with interesting special cases and generalized matrix transforms.
