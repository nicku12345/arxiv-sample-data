We discuss the relationship between ratio asymptotics for general orthogonal polynomials and the asymptotics of the associated Bergman shift operator. More specifically, we consider the case in which a measure is supported on an infinite compact subset of the complex plane. We show that there is a straightforward connection between the corresponding orthonormal polynomials exhibiting ratio asymptotics and the corresponding Bergman shift operator being asymptotically Toeplitz. We also discuss a connection to the weak asymptotics of the measures derived from the orthonormal polynomials.
