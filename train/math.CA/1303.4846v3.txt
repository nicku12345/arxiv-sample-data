A pair of linearly independent asymptotic solutions are constructed for the second-order linear difference equation {equation*} P_{n+1}(x)-(A_{n}x+B_{n})P_{n}(x)+P_{n-1}(x)=0, {equation*} where A_n and B_n have asymptotic expansions of the form {equation*} A_n\sim n^{-\theta}\sum_{s=0}^\infty\frac{\alpha_s}{n^s},\qquad B_n\sim\sum_{s=0}^\infty\frac{\beta_s}{n^s}, {equation*} with \theta\neq0 and \alpha_0\neq0 being real numbers, and \beta_0=\pm2. Our result hold uniformly for the scaled variable t in an infinite interval containing the transition point t_1=0, where t=(n+\tau_0)^{-\theta} x and \tau_0 is a small shift. In particular, it is shown how the Bessel functions J_\nu and Y_\nu get involved in the uniform asymptotic expansions of the solutions to the above three-term recurrence relation. As an illustration of the main result, we derive a uniform asymptotic expansion for the orthogonal polynomials associated with the Laguerre-type weight x^\alpha\exp(-q_mx^m), x>0, where m is a positive integer, \alpha>-1 and q_m>0.
