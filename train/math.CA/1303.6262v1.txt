We shall first study summability of families in normed spaces indexed with well ordered sets of real numbers extended by infinity. Obtained results and a generalized iteration method are applied to derive necessary and sufficient conditions for HK, HL, Bochner and Riemann integrability of step mappings and for right regulated mappings from an interval of reals extended by infinity to a Banach space. Finally, solvability of impulsive differential equations are studied.
