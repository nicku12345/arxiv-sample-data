We expand the ranges of permissible values of n (n\in\mathbb{N}) for which Poisson kernels P_{q,\beta}(t)=\sum\limits_{k=1}^{\infty}q^k\cos\left(kt-\dfrac{\beta\pi}{2}\right), {q\in(0,1)}, \beta\in\mathbb{R}, satisfy Kushpel's condition C_{y,2n}. As a consequence, we obtain exact values for Kolmogorov widths in the space C (L) of classes C_{\beta,\infty}^q (C_{\beta,1}^q) of Poisson integrals generated by kernels P_{q,\beta}(t) in new situations. It is shown that obtained here results we can't obtain by using methods of finding of exact lower bounds for widths suggested by A. Pinkus.
