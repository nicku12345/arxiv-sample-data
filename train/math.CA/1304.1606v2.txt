The definite integrals  \int_{-1}^1(1-x^2)^{(\nu-1)/2}[P_\nu(x)]^3\D x,  \int_{-1}^1(1-x^2)^{(\nu-1)/2}[P_\nu(x)]^2P_{\nu}(-x)\D x, \int_{-1}^1x(1-x^2)^{(\nu-1)/2}[P_{\nu+1}(x)]^3\D x  and \int_{-1}^1x(1-x^2)^{(\nu-1)/2}[P_{\nu+1}(x)]^2P_{\nu+1}(-x)\D x  are evaluated in closed form, where P_\nu is the Legendre function of degree \nu, and  \R\nu>-1. Special cases of these formulae are related to certain integrals over elliptic integrals that have arithmetic interest.
