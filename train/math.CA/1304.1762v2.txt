A fractal oscillatority of solutions of second-order differential equations near infinity is measured by oscillatory and phase dimensions. The phase dimension is defined as a box dimension of the trajectory (x,\dot{x}) in \mathbb{R}^2 of a solution x=x(t), assuming that (x,\dot{x}) is a spiral converging to the origin. In this work, we study the phase dimension of the class of second-order nonautonomous differential equations with oscillatory solutions including the Bessel equation. We prove that the phase dimension of Bessel functions is equal to 4/3, and that the corresponding trajectory is a wavy spiral, exhibiting an interesting behavior. The phase dimension of a generalization of the Bessel equation has been also computed.
