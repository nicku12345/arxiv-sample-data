This survey paper contains brief historical information, main known facts and original author's results on the theory of transmutations and some applications. Operators of Buschman-Erdelyi type were first studied by E.T.Copson, R.G.Buschman and A.Erdelyi as integral operators. In 1990's the author was first to prove transmutational nature of these operators and published papers with detailed study of their properties. This class include as special cases such famous objects as Sonine-Poisson-Delsarte transmutations and fractional Riemann-Lioville integrals. In this paper Buschman-Erdelyi transmutations are fully classified as operators of the first kind with special case of zero order smoothness operators, second kind and third kind with special case of unitary Sonine-Katrakhov and Poisson-Katrakhov transmutations. We study such properties as transmutational conditions, factorizations, norm estimates, connections with classical integral transforms. Applications are considered to singular partial differential equations, embedding theorems with sharp constants in Kipriyanov spaces, Euler-Poisson-Darboux equation including Copson lemma, generalized translations, Dunkl operators, Radon transform, generalized harmonics theory, Hardy operators, V.V.Katrakhov's results on pseudodifferential operators and problems of new kind for equations with solutions of arbitrary growth at singularity.   The Russian original paper version is also included, it is slightly different from english one.
