We introduce the notion of Dunkl positive definite and strictly positive definite functions on \mathbb{R}^{d}. This done by the use of the properties of Dunkl translation. We establish the analogue of Bochner's theorem in Dunkl setting. The case of radial functions is considered. We give a sufficient condition for a function to be Dunkl strictly positive definite on \mathbb{R}^{d}.
