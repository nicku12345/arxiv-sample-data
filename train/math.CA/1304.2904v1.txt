We consider several harmonic analysis operators in the multi-dimensional context of the Dunkl Laplacian with the underlying group of reflections isomorphic to \mathbb{Z}_2^n (also negative values of the multiplicity function are admitted). Our investigations include maximal operators, g-functions, Lusin area integrals, Riesz transforms and multipliers of Laplace and Laplace-Stieltjes transform type. Using the general Calder\'on-Zygmund theory we prove that these objects are bounded in weighted L^p spaces, 1<p<\infty, and from L^1 into weak L^{1}.
