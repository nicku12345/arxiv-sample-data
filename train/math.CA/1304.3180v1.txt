In this paper, we find some new sharp bounds for \left(\sin x\right) /x, which unify and refine Jordan, Adamovi\'{c}-Mitrinovi\'{c}and and Cusa's inequalities. As applications of main results, some new Shafer-Fink type inequalities for arc sine function and ones for certain bivariate means are established, and a simpler but more accurate estimate for sine integral is derived.
