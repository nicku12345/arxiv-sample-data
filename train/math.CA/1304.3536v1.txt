We consider an abstract non-negative self-adjoint operator H on an L^2-space. We derive a characterization for the restriction estimate \| dE_H(\lambda) \|_{L^p \to L^{p'}} \le C \lambda^{\frac{d}{2}(\frac{1}{p} - \frac{1}{p'}) -1} in terms of higher order derivatives of the semigroup e^{-tH}. We provide an alternative proof of a result in [1] which asserts that dispersive estimates imply restriction estimates. We also prove L^p-L^{p'} estimates for the derivatives of the spectral resolution of H.
