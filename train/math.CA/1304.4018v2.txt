In this paper we find new equivalent norms in L^p(\mathbb{R}^n,\mathbb{B}) by using multivariate Littlewood-Paley functions associated with Poisson semigroup for the Hermite operator, provided that \mathbb{B} is a UMD Banach space with the property (\alpha). We make use of \gamma-radonifying operators to get new equivalent norms that allow us to obtain L^p(\mathbb{R}^n,\mathbb{B})-boundedness properties for (vector valued) multivariate spectral multipliers for Hermite operators. As application of this Hermite multiplier theorem we prove that the Banach valued Hermite Sobolev and potential spaces coincide.
