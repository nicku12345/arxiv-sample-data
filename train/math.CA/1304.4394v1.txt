In this study we are concerned with a class of generalized BVP' s consisting of eigendependent boundary conditions and supplementary transmission conditions at finite number interior points. By modifying some techniques of classical Sturm-Liouville theory and suggesting own approaches we find asymptotic formulas for the eigenvalues and eigenfunction.
