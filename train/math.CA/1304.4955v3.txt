This paper is concerned with restricted families of projections in \mathbb{R}^{3}. Let K \subset \mathbb{R}^{3} be a Borel set with Hausdorff dimension \dim K = s > 1. If \mathcal{G} is a smooth and sufficiently well-curved one-dimensional family of two-dimensional subspaces, the main result states that there exists \sigma(s) > 1 such that \dim \pi_{V}(K) \geq \sigma(s) for almost all V \in \mathcal{G}. A similar result is obtained for some specific families of one-dimensional subspaces.
