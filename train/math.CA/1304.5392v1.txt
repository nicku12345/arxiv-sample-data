In this paper, we prove that for fixed k\geq 1, the Wilker type inequality {equation*} \frac{2}{k+2}(\frac{\sin x}{x}) ^{kp}+\frac{k}{k+2}(\frac{% \tan x}{x})^{p}>1 {equation*}% holds for x\in (0,\pi /2)  if and only if p>0 or p\leq -% \frac{\ln (k+2) -\ln 2}{k(\ln \pi -\ln 2)}. It is reversed if and only if -\frac{12}{5(k+2)}\leq p<0. Its hyperbolic version holds for x\in (0,\infty)  if and only if % p>0 or p\leq -\frac{12}{5(k+2)}. And, for fixed k<-2, the hyperbolic version is reversed if and only if p<0 or p\geq -\frac{12}{% 5(k+2)}. Our results unify and generalize some known ones.
