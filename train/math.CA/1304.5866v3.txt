In this paper, we introduce a new differential-difference operator T_\xi (\xi \in \mathbb{R}^N) by using projections associated to orthogonal subsystems in root systems. Similarly to Dunkl theory, we show that these operators commute and we construct an intertwining operator between T_\xi and the directional derivative \partial_\xi. In the case of one variable, we prove that the Kummer functions are eigenfunctions of this operator.
