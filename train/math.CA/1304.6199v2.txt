We establish that the spectral multiplier \frak{M}(G_{\alpha}) associated to the differential operator  G_{\alpha}=- \Delta_x +\sum_{j=1}^m{{\alpha_j^2-1/4}\over{x_j^2}}-|x|^2 \Delta_y \; \text{on} (0,\infty)^m \times \R^n, which we denominate Bessel-Grushin operator, is of weak type (1,1) provided that \frak{M} is in a suitable local Sobolev space. In order to do this we prove a suitable weighted Plancherel estimate. Also, we study L^p-boundedness properties of Riesz transforms associated to G_{\alpha}, in the case n=1.
