In the context of complex WKB analysis, we discuss a one-dimensional Schr\"odinger equation  -h^2\partial_x^2 f(x,h) + [Q(x)+hQ_1(x,h)]f(x,h) =0, \ \ \ h\to 0,  where Q(x), Q_1(x,h) are analytic near the origin x=0, Q(0)=0, and Q_1(x,h) is a factorially divergent power series in h. We show that there is a change of independent variable y=y(x,h), analytic near x=0 and factorially divergent with respect to h, that transforms the above Schr\"odinger equation to a canonical form. The proof goes by reduction to a mildly nonlinear equation on y(x,h) and by solving it using an appropriately modified Newton's method of tangents. Our result generalizes that of Aoki, Kawai, and Takei.
