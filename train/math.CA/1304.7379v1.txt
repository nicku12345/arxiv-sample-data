We obtained order estimations for the best uniform approximations by trigonometric polynomials and approximations by Fourier sums of classes of 2\pi-periodic continuous functions, which (\psi,\beta)-derivatives f_{\beta}^{\psi} belong to unit balls of spaces L_{p}, 1\leq p<\infty in case at consequences \psi(k) decrease to nought faster than any power function. We also established the analogical estimations in L_{s}-metric, 1<s\leq\infty, for classes of the summable (\psi,\beta)-differentiable functions, such that \parallel f_{\beta}^{\psi}\parallel_{1}\leq1.
