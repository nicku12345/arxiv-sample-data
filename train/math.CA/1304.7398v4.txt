We obtain a new square function characterization of the weak Hardy space H^{p,\infty} for all p\in(0,\iy). This space consists of all tempered distributions whose smooth maximal function lies in weak L^p. Our proof is based on interpolation between H^p spaces. The main difficulty we overcome is the lack of a good dense subspace of H^{p,\infty} which forces us to work with general H^{p,\infty} distributions.
