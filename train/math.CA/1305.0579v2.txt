We consider the equation  \dot x(t)=f(t,x(t),x(\eta(t)))  with a variable time-shift \eta(t). Both the nonlinearity f and the shift function \eta are given, and are assumed to be analytic (that is, holomorphic) functions of their arguments. Typically the time-shift represents a delay, namely that \eta(t)=t-r(t) with r(t)\ge 0. The main problem considered is to determine when solutions (generally C^\infty and often periodic solutions) of the differential equation are analytic functions of t; and more precisely, to determine for a given solution at which values of t it is analytic, and at which values it is not analytic. Both sufficient conditions for analyticity, and also for nonanalyticity, at certain values of t are obtained. It is shown that for some equations there exists a solution which is C^\infty everywhere, and is analytic at certain values of t but is not analytic at other values of t. Throughout our analysis, the dynamic properties of the map t\to \eta(t) play a crucial role.
