In this paper we study the inverse of the eigenfunction \sin_p of the one-dimensional p-Laplace operator and its dependence on the parameter p, and we present a Tur\'an type inequality for this function. Similar inequalities are given also for other generalized inverse trigonometric and hyperbolic functions. In particular, we deduce a Tur\'an type inequality for a series considered by Ramanujan, involving the digamma function.
