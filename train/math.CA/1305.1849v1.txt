Two integral operator involving the Appell's functions, or Horn's function in the kernel are considered. Composition of such functions with generalized Bessel functions of the first kind are expressed in term of generalized Wright function and generalized hypergeometric series. Many special cases, including cosine and sine function are also discussed.
