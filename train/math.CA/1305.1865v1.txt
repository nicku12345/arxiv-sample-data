In this paper, we will give the weighted bounds for multilinear fractional maximal type operators \mathcal{M}_{\Omega,\alpha} with rough homogeneous kernels. We obtain a mixed A_{(\vec{P},q)}-A_\infty bound and a A_{\vec{P}} type estimate for \mathcal{M}_{\Omega,\alpha}. As an application, we give an almost sharp estimate for the multilinear fractional integral operator with rough kernels \mathcal{I}_{\Omega,\alpha}.
