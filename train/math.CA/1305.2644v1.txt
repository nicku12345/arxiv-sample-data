In this work we characterize a full Kostant-Toda system in terms of a family of matrix polynomials orthogonal with respect to a complex matrix measure. In order to study the solution of this dynamical system we give explicit expressions for the Weyl function and we also obtain, under some conditions, a representation of the vector of linear functionals associated with this system.
