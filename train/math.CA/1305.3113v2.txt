We give a systematic and unified discussion of various classes of hypergeometric type equations: the hypergeometric equation, the confluent equation, the F_1 equation (equivalent to the Bessel equation), the Gegenbauer equation and the Hermite equation. In particular, we discuss recurrence relations of their solutions, their integral representations and discrete symmetries.
