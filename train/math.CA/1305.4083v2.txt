By using Cauchy integral formula in the theory of complex functions, the authors establish some integral representations for the principal branches of several complex functions involving the logarithmic function, find some properties, such as being operator monotone function, being complete Bernstein function, and being Stieltjes function, for these functions, and verify a conjecture on complete monotonicity of a function involving the logarithmic function.
