Commutators of bilinear pseudodifferential operators with symbols in the H\"ormander class BS_{1, 0}^1 and multiplication by Lipschitz functions are shown to be bilinear Calder\'on-Zygmund operators. A connection with a notion of compactness in the bilinear setting for the iteration of the commutators is also made.
