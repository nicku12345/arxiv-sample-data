We obtain order-exact estimates for uniform approximations by using Zygmund sums Z^{s}_{n} of classes C^{\psi}_{\beta,p} of 2\pi-periodic continuous functions f representable by convolutions of functions from unit balls of the space L_{p}, 1< p<\infty, with a fixed kernels \Psi_{\beta}\in L_{p'}, \frac{1}{p}+\frac{1}{p'}=1. In addition, we find a set of allowed values of parameters (that define the class C^{\psi}_{\beta,p} and the linear method Z^{s}_{n}) for which Zygmund sums and Fejer sums realize the order of the best uniform approximations by trigonometric polynomials of those classes.
