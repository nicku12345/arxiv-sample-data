We prove a boundedness criterion for a class of dyadic multilinear forms acting on two-dimensional functions. Their structure is more general than the one of classical multilinear Calder\'{o}n-Zygmund operators as several functions can now depend on the same one-dimensional variable. The study of this class is motivated by examples related to the two-dimensional bilinear Hilbert transform and to bilinear ergodic averages. This paper is a sequel to the prior paper arXiv:1108.0917 by the first author.
