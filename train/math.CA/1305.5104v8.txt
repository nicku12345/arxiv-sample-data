We prove a two weight theorem for alpha-fractional singular integrals in higher dimensions, assuming energy side conditions. We also show that reversal of the Energy Lemma fails for the vector Riesz transforms in the plane, as well as other collections of convolution Calderon-Zygmund operators in the plane, and when alpha = 1, even for the infinite vector of all classical 1-fractional Calderon-Zygmund operators.
