Let V be any shift-invariant subspace of square summable functions. We prove that if for some A expansive dilation V is A-refinable, then the completeness property is equivalent to several conditions on the local behaviour at the origin of the spectral function of V, among them the origin is a point of A^*-approximate continuity of the spectral function if we assume this value to be one. We present our results also in the more general setting of A-reducing spaces. We also prove that the origin is a point of A^*-approximate continuity of the Fourier transform of any semiorthogonal tight frame wavelet if we assume this value to be zero.
