We construct Salem sets on the real line with endpoint Fourier decay and near-endpoint regularity properties. This complements a result of \L aba and Pramanik, who obtained near-endpoint Fourier decay and endpoint regularity properties. We then modify the construction to extend a theorem of Hambrook and \L aba to show sharpness of the L^2-Fourier restriction estimate by Mockenhaupt and Bak-Seeger, including the case where the Hausdorff and Fourier dimension do not coincide.
