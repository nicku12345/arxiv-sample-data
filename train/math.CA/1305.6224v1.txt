A principal shift invariant subspace of L^{2}(\IR) is isometric to a weighted norm space L^{2}(\IT, w). Using results obtained earlier by the author on the basis properties of subsystems of the trigonometric system in the weighted norm spaces L^{2}(\IT, w) we obtain corresponding results concerning generators of principal shift invariant subspaces.
