We continue developing the theory of conical and vertical square functions on R^{n}, where \mu is a power bounded measure, possibly non-doubling. We provide new boundedness criteria and construct various counterexamples.   First, we prove a general local Tb theorem with tent space T^{2,\infty} type testing conditions to characterise the L^{2} boundedness. Second, we completely answer the question, whether the boundedness of our operators on L^{2} implies boundedness on other L^{p} spaces, including the endpoints. For the conical square function, the answers are generally affirmative, but the vertical square function can be unbounded on L^{p} for p > 2, even if \mu = dx. For this, we present a counterexample. Our kernels s_t, t > 0, do not necessarily satisfy any continuity in the first variable -- a point of technical importance throughout the paper.   Third, we construct a non-doubling Cantor-type measure and an associated conical square function operator, whose L^{2} boundedness depends on the exact aperture of the cone used in the definition. Thus, in the non-homogeneous world, the 'change of aperture' technique -- widely used in classical tent space literature -- is not available. Fourth, we establish the sharp A_{p}-weighted bound for the conical square function under the assumption that \mu is doubling.
