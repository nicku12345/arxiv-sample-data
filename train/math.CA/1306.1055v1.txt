We control a broad class of singular (or "rough") Fourier multipliers by geometrically-defined maximal operators via general weighted L^2(\mathbb{R}) norm inequalities. The multipliers involved are related to those of Coifman--Rubio de Francia--Semmes, satisfying certain weak Marcinkiewicz-type conditions that permit highly oscillatory factors of the form e^{i|\xi|^\alpha} for both \alpha positive and negative. The maximal functions that arise are of some independent interest, involving fractional averages associated with tangential approach regions (related to those of Nagel and Stein), and more novel "improper fractional averages" associated with "escape" regions. Some applications are given to the theory of L^p-L^q multipliers, oscillatory integrals and dispersive PDE, along with natural extensions to higher dimensions.
