We give the definition of uniform symmetric continuity for functions defined on a nonempty subset of the real line. Then we investigate the properties of uniformly symmetrically continuous functions and compare them with those of symmetrically continuous functions and uniformly continuous functions. We obtain some characterizations of uniformly symmetrically continuous functions. Several examples are also given.
