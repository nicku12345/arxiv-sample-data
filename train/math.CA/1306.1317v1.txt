It is well-known that the first and second Painlev\'e equations admit solutions characterised by divergent asymptotic expansions near infinity in specified sectors of the complex plane. Such solutions are pole-free in these sectors and called tronqu\'ee solutions by Boutroux. In this paper, we show that similar solutions exist for the third and fourth Painlev\'e equations as well.
