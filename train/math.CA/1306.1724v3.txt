Let v,~\omega_1, ~\omega_2 be weights and 1<p_1, ~p_2<\infty. Suppose that \frac{1}{p}=\frac{1}{p_1}+\frac{1}{p_2} and (\omega_1, \omega_2)\in RH(p_1, p_2). For the multisublinear maximal operator \mathfrak{M} in martingale spaces, we characterize the weights for which \mathfrak{M} is bounded from L^{p_1}(\omega_1)\times L^{p_2}(\omega_2) to L^{p,\infty}(v)\hbox{or}L^p(v). If v=\omega_2^{\frac{p}{p_2}}\omega_2^{\frac{p}{p_2}}, we partially give the bilinear version of one-weight theory.
