Dinh D\~ung and T. Ullrich have proven a multivariate Whitney's theorem for the local anisotropic polynomial approximation in L_p(Q) for 1 \le p \le \infty, where Q is a d-parallelepiped in \RR^d with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. They considered the error of best approximation of a function f by algebraic polynomials of fixed degree at most r_i - 1 in variable x_i,\ i=1,...,d. The convergence rate of the approximation error when the size of Q going to 0 is characterized by a so-called total mixed modulus of smoothness. The method of proof used by these authors is not suitable to the case 0 <p<1. In the present paper, by a different method we proved this theorem for 0< p \le \infty.
