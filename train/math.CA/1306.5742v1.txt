We give a proof and extension of two formulas of Frobenius and Stickelberger of Differential Calculus that they used in a fundamental paper concerning elliptic functions theory. Our main ingredient is the introduction of a bilinear form which is a vast generalization of Leibniz formula. This bilinear form is also connected to the Lagrange product formula. As a corollary, we give a different proof of a theorem of P.J. Olver.
