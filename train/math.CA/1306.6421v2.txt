In this paper we consider sequences of polynomials orthogonal with respect to certain discrete Laguerre-Sobolev inner product, with two perturbations (involving derivatives) located inside the oscillatory region for the classical Laguerre polynomials. We focus our attention on the representation of these polynomials in terms of the classical Laguerre polynomials and deduce the coefficients of their corresponding five-term recurrence relation, as well as the asymptotic behavior of these coefficients when the degree of the polynomials tends to infinity. Also, the outer relative asymptotics of orthogonal polynomials with respect to this discrete Sobolev inner product is analyzed.
