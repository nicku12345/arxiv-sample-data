Spectral components of one-dimensional Schr\"odinger operator with complex potential are investigated. An effective upper bound for the total number of eigenvalues and spectral singularities is established. For dissipative Schr\"odinger operator sufficient condition is found which guarantees the absence of singular component in the continuous spectrum and spectral decomposition is exposed.
