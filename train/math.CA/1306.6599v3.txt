The space of polynomials in two real variables with values in a 2-dimensional irreducible module of a dihedral group is studied as a standard module for Dunkl operators. The one-parameter case is considered (omitting the two-parameter case for even dihedral groups). The matrix weight function for the Gaussian form is found explicitly by solving a boundary value problem, and then computing the normalizing constant. An orthogonal basis for the homogeneous harmonic polynomials is constructed. The coefficients of these polynomials are found to be balanced terminating _4F_3-series.
