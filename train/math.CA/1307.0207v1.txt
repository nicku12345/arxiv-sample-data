This paper studies the following weighted, fractional Bernstein inequality for spherical polynomials on \sph:   \begin{equation}\label{4-1-TD-ab} \|(-\Delta_0)^{r/2} f\|_{p,w}\leq C_w n^{r} \|f\|_{p,w}, \ \ \forall f\in \Pi_n^d, \end{equation} where \Pi_n^d denotes the space of all spherical polynomials of degree at most n on \sph, and (-\Delta_0)^{r/2} is the fractional Laplacian-Beltrami operator on \sph.   A new class of doubling weights with conditions weaker than the A_p is introduced, and used to fully characterize those doubling weights w on \sph for which the weighted Bernstein inequality \eqref{4-1-TD-ab} holds for some 1\leq p\leq \infty and all r>\tau. In the unweighted case, it is shown that if 0<p<\infty and r>0 is not an even integer, then \eqref{4-1-TD-ab} with w\equiv 1 holds if and only if r>(d-1)(\f 1p-1). As applications, we show that any function f\in L_p(\sph) with 0<p<1 can be approximated by the de la Vall\'ee Poussin means of a Fourier-Laplace series, and establish a sharp Sobolev type Embedding theorem for the weighted Besov spaces with respect to general doubling weights.
