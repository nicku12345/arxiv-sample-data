The Ap\'ery polynomials and in particular their asymptotic behavior play an essential role in the understanding of the irrationality of \zeta(3). In this paper, we present a method to study the asymptotic behavior of the sequence of the Ap\'ery polynomials ((B_{n})_{n=1}^{\infty}) in the whole complex plane as (n\rightarrow \infty). The proofs are based on a multivariate version of the complex saddle point method. Moreover, the asymptotic zero distributions for the polynomials ((B_{n})_{n=1}^{\infty}) and for some transformed Ap\'ery polynomials are derived by means of the theory of logarithmic potentials with external fields, establishing a characterization as the unique solution of a weighted equilibrium problem. The method applied is a general one, so that the treatment can serve as a model for the study of objects related to the Ap\'ery polynomials.
