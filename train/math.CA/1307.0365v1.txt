In this work, we consider not only a discontinuous boundary-value problem with retarded argument and four supplementary transmission conditions at the two points of discontinuities but also, eigenparameter-dependent boundary conditions and obtain asymptotic formulas for the eigenvalues and corresponding eigenfunctions.
