In this paper, we investigate what are Carleson measures on open subsets in the complex plane. A circular domain is a connected open subset whose boundary consists of finitely many disjoint circles. We call a domain G multi-nicely connected if there exists a circular domain W and a conformal map \psi from W onto G such that \psi is almost univalent with respect the arclength on \partial W. We characterize all Carleson measures for those open subsets so that each of their components is multi-nicely connected and harmonic measures of the components are mutually singular. Our results suggest the extend of Carleson measures probably is up to this class of open subsets.
