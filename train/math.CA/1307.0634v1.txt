The main purpose of this paper is to give characterization theorems on derivations as well as on linear functions. Among others the following problem will be investigated: Let n\in\mathbb{Z}, f, g\colon\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R} be additive functions, <{array}{cc} a&b c&d {array}>\in\mathbf{GL}_{2}(\mathbb{Q}) be arbitrarily fixed, and let us assume that the mapping \[   \phi(x)=g<\frac{ax^{n}+b}{cx^{n}+d}>-\frac{x^{n-1}f(x)}{(cx^{n}+d)^{2}} \quad <x\in\mathbb{R}, cx^{n}+d\neq 0> \] satisfies some regularity on its domain (e.g. (locally) boundedness, continuity, measurability). Is it true that in this case the above functions can be represented as a sum of a derivation and a linear function? Analogous statements ensuring linearity will also be presented.
