In this paper the following implication is verified for certain basic algebraic curves: if the additive real function f approximately (i.e., with a bounded error) satisfies the derivation rule along the graph of the algebraic curve in consideration, then f can be represented as the sum of a derivation and a linear function. When, instead of the additivity of f, it is assumed that, in addition, the Cauchy difference of f is bounded, a stability theorem is obtained for such characterizations of derivations.
