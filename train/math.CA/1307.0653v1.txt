The purpose of the present paper is to solve (under some assumption on the domain) the equation  g(x+y)-g(x)-g(y)=xf(y)+yf(x).  After determining the general solutions, we will investigate the so--called alien solutions. %More precisely, we will examine the cases when the above equation implies that %g(x+y)=g(x)+g(y) and xf(y)+yf(x)=0. %Concerning this, necessary and sufficient conditions will be provided. Finally, we will discuss the real solutions of the following related functional inequality:  g(x+y)-g(x)-g(y)\geq xf(y)+yf(x).
