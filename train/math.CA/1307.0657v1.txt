The purpose of this paper is to summarize the recent results on the stability of the parametric fundamental equation of information. Furthermore, by the help of a modification of a method we used in \cite{GM08} we shall give a unified proof for the Hyers--Ulam stability of the equation in question, assuming that the parameter does not equal to 1. As a corollary of the main result, a system of equations, that defines the recursive and semi--symmetric information measures is also discussed.
