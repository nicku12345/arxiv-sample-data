In this note we give a characterization of a family of relative entropies on open domain depending on a real parameter \alpha based on recursivity and symmetry. In the cases \alpha=1 and \alpha=0 we use additionally a weak regularity assumption while in the other cases no regularity assumptions are made at all.
