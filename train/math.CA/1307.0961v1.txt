Let the symbols \{\gamma\},\ \{t_0\};\ t_0\not=\gamma denote the sequences of the roots of the equations Z(t)=0,\quad \text{and}\qquad Z'(t)=0, respectively, and m(t_0)=\min\{\gamma"-t_0,t_0-\gamma'\},\quad Q(t_0)=\max\{\gamma"-t_0,t_0-\gamma'\},\quad \gamma'<t_0<\gamma", where \gamma',\gamma" are the neighboring zeroes. We have proved the following in this paper: on the Riemann hypothesis we have \frac{Q(t_0)}{m(t_0)}<t_0\ln^2t_0\ln_2t_0\ln_3t_0,\quad t_0\to\infty. This paper is the English version of the paper of ref. \cite{5}.
