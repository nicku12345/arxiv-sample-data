Given a sequence of polynomials (p_n)_n, an algebra of operators \mathcal{A} acting in the linear space of polynomials and an operator D_p\in \mathcal{A} with D_p(p_n)=np_n, we form a new sequence of polynomials (q_n)_n by considering a linear combination of m consecutive p_n: q_n=p_n+\sum_{j=1}^m\beta_{n,j}p_{n-j}. Using the concept of \mathcal{D}-operator, we determine the structure of the sequences \beta_{n,j}, j=1,\ldots,m, in order that the polynomials (q_n)_n are common eigenfunctions of an operator in the algebra \mathcal{A}. As an application, from the classical discrete families of Charlier, Meixner and Krawtchouk we construct orthogonal polynomials (q_n)_n which are also eigenfunctions of higher order difference operators.
