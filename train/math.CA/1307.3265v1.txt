In this paper, the author introduces the concept of the quasi-geometrically convex and defines a new identity for fractional integrals. By using of this identity, author obtains new estimates on generalization of Hadamard, Ostrowski and Simpson type inequalities for GA-s-convex, quasi-geometrically convex and (s,m)-GA-convex functions via Riemann Liouville fractional integral.
