We establish the Hyers-Ulam stability of certain linear first-order differential equations with singularities. We then extend these results to higher-order singular linear differential equations that can be written with these first-order factors. An example of our results is given for a second-order singular linear differential equation that is not be covered by the current literature in this area.
