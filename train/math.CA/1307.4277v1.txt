The main aim of this note is to provide characterization theorems concerning real derivations. Among others the following implication will be verified: Assume that \xi\colon \mathbb{R}\to \mathbb{R} is a given differentiable function and for the additive function d\colon \mathbb{R}\to \mathbb{R}, the mapping \[ x\longmapsto d(\xi(x))-\xi'(x)d(x) \] is regular (e. g. measurable, continuous, locally bounded). Then d is a sum of a derivation and a linear function.
