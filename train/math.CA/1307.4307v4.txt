Using q-series identities and series rearrangement, we establish several extensions of q-Watson formulas with two extra integer parameters. Then they and Sears' transformation formula are utilized to derive some generalizations of q-Dixon formulas and q-Whipple formulas with two extra integer parameters. As special cases of these results, many interesting evaluations of series of q-Watson,q-Dixon, and q-Whipple type are displayed.
