Tube formulas refer to the study of volumes of r neighbourhoods of sets. For sets satisfying some (possible very weak) convexity conditions, this has a long history. However, within the past 20 years Lapidus has initiated and pioneered a systematic study of tube formulas for fractal sets. Following this, it is natural to ask to what extend it is possible to develop a theory of multifractal tube formulas for multifractal measures. In this paper we propose and develop a framework for such a theory. Firstly, we define multifractal tube formulas and, more generally, multifractal tube measures for general multifractal measures. Secondly, we introduce and develop two approaches for analysing these concepts for self-similar multifractal measures, namely:   (1) Multifractal tubes of self-similar measures and renewal theory. Using techniques from renewal theory we give a complete description of the asymptotic behaviour of the multifractal tube formulas and tube measures of self-similar measures satisfying the Open Set Condition.   (2) Multifractal tubes of self-similar measures and zeta-functions. Unfortunately, renewal theory techniques do not yield "explicit" expressions for the functions describing the asymptotic behaviour of the multifractal tube formulas and tube measures of self-similar measures. This is clearly undesirable. For this reason, we introduce and develop a second framework for studying multifractal tube formulas of self-similar measures. This approach is based on multifractal zeta-functions and allow us obtain "explicit" expressions for the multifractal tube formulas of self-similar measures, namely, using the Mellin transform and the residue theorem, we are able to express the multifractal tube formulas as sums involving the residues of the zeta-function.
