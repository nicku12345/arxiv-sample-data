In the paper the author provides necessary and sufficient conditions on a for the function \frac{1}{2}\ln(2\pi)-x+\bigl(x-\frac{1}{2}\bigr)\ln x-\ln\Gamma(x)+\frac1{12}{\psi'(x+a)} and its negative to be completely monotonic on (0,\infty), where a\ge0 is a real number, \Gamma(x) is the classical gamma function, and \psi(x)=\frac{\Gamma'(x)}{\Gamma(x)} is the di-gamma function. As applications, some known results and new inequalities are derived.
