We study reverse triangle inequalities for Riesz potentials and their connection with polarization. This work generalizes inequalities for sup norms of products of polynomials, and reverse triangle inequalities for logarithmic potentials. The main tool used in the proofs is the representation for a power of the farthest distance function as a Riesz potential of a unit Borel measure.
