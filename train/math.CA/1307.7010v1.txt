A vector space over a field \mathbb{F} is a set V together with two binary operations, called vector addition and scalar multiplication. It is standard practice to think of a Euclidean space \mathbb{R}^n as an n-dimensional real coordinate space i.e. the space of all n-tuples of real numbers (R^n), with vector operations defined using real addition and multiplication coordinate-wise. A natural question which arises is if it is possible to redefine vector operations on the space in such a way that it acquires some other dimension, say k (over the same field i.e., \mathbb{R}). In this paper, we answer the question in the affirmative, for all k\in\mathbb{N}. We achieve the required dimension by `dragging' the structure of a standard k-dimensional Euclidean space (\R{k}) on the n-tuple of real numbers (R^n). At the heart of the argument is Cantor's counterintuitive result that \mathbb{R} is numerically equivalent to \mathbb{R}^n for all n\in\mathbb{N}, which can be proved through an elegant construction. Finally, we generalize the result to all finite dimensional vector spaces.
