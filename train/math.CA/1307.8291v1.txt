In this paper, new identity for fractional integrals have been defined. By using of this identity, we obtained new general inequalities containing all of Hadamard, Ostrowski and Simpson type inequalities for for functions whose derivatives in absolute value at certain power are ({\alpha},m)-convex via Riemann Liouville fractional integral.
