Certain rearrangement inequalities of a type considered by Hardy, Riesz, and Brascamp-Lieb-Luttinger are studied. Subsets of the real line that extremize these inequalities are characterized. Our results apply only to special cases, and complement earlier results by Burchard treating other cases.   This draft incorporates minor corrections and clarifications.
