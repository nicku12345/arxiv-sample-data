By considering a suitable Besov type norm, we obtain refined Sobolev inequalities on a family of Riemannian manifolds with (possibly exponentially large) ends. The interest is twofold: on one hand, these inequalities are stable by multiplication by rapidly oscillating functions, much as the original ones \cite{GMO}, and on the other hand our Besov space is stable by spectral localization associated to the Laplace-Beltrami operator (while  L^p  spaces, with  p \ne 2 , are in general not preserved by such localizations on manifolds with exponentially large ends). We also prove an abstract version of refined Sobolev inequalities for any selfadjoint operator on a measure space (Proposition \ref{general}).
