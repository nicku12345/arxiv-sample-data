A local median decomposition is used to prove that a weighted local mean of a function is controlled by a weighted local mean of its local sharp maximal function. Together with (a local version of) the estimate M^{\sharp}_{0,s}(Tf)(x) \le c\,Mf(x) for Calder\'{o}n-Zygmund singular integral operators, this allows us to express the local weighted integral control of Tf by Mf. Similar estimates hold for T replaced by singular integrals with kernels satisfying H\"{o}rmander-type conditions or integral operators with homogeneous kernels, and M replaced by an appropriate maximal function M_T. Using sharper bounds in the local median decomposition we prove two-weight, L^p_v-L^q_w estimates for singular integral operators for 1<p\le q<\infty. In all cases, the results include weights that are not necessarily A_{\infty}. The local nature of these estimates leads to results involving weighted generalized Orlicz-Campanato and Orlicz-Morrey spaces.
