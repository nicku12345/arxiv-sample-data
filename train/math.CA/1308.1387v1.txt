We consider the L^p \rightarrow L^q mapping properties of a model family of Radon-like operators integrating functions over n-dimensional submanifolds of {\mathbb R}^{2n}. It is shown that nonvanishing rotational curvature is never generic when n \geq 2 and is, in fact, impossible for all but finitely many values of n. Nevertheless, operators satisfying the same L^p \rightarrow L^q estimates as the "nondegenerate" case (modulo the endpoint) are dense in the model family for all n.
