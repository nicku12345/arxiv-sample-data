In this paper we study single-parametric systems of integer shifts of Gauss and Lorenz functions. In case of Cauchy--Lorenz system we explicitly calculate nod functions and prove that it tends to sinc function in limit. For both Gauss and Cauchy--Lorenz systems and corresponding nod functions we explicitly calculate Riesz constants via trigonometric, hyperbolic and Jacobi theta-functions, also limit behavior of this values is found depending on parameters.   A special result is a sharp monotonicity property proved for a special ratio of Jacobi theta-functions which is important in many areas. Brief discussion of numerical methods is included with additional references. Different applications are outlined to coherent states and atomic spectra.   Some unsolved problems and comments are added.
