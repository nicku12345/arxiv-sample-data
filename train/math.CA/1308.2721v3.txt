Gowers introduced the notion of uniformity norm \|f\|_{U^k(G)} of a bounded function f:G\rightarrow\mathbb{R} on an abelian group G in order to provide a Fourier-theoretic proof of Szemeredi's Theorem, that is, that a subset of the integers of positive upper density contains arbitrarily long arithmetic progressions. Since then, Gowers norms have found a number of other uses, both within and outside of Additive Combinatorics. The U^k norm is defined in terms of an operator \triangle^k : L^{\infty}(G)\mapsto L^{\infty} (G^{k+1}).   In this paper, we introduce an analogue of the object \triangle^k f when f is a singular measure on the torus \mathbb{T}^d, and similarly an object \|\mu\|_{U^k}. We provide criteria for \triangle^k \mu to exist, which turns out to be equivalent to finiteness of \||\mu|\|_{U^k}, and show that when \mu is absolutely continuous with density f, then the objects which we have introduced are reduced to the standard \triangle^kf and \|f\|_{U^k(\mathbb{T})}. We further introduce a higher-order inner product between measures of finite U^k norm and prove a Gowers-Cauchy-Schwarz inequality for this inner product.
