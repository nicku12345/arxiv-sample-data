This paper continues work begun in \cite{M1}, in which we introduced a theory of Gowers uniformity norms for singular measures on \mathbb{R}^d. There, given a d-dimensional measure \mu, we introduced a (k+1)d-dimensional measure \triangle^k\mu, and developed a Uniformity norm \|\mu\|_{U^k} whose 2^k-th power is equivalent to \triangle^k\mu([0,1]^{d(k+1)}. In the present work, we introduce a fractal dimension associated to measures \mu which we refer to as the kth-order Fourier dimension of \mu. This k-th order Fourier dimension is a normalization of the asymptotic decay rate of the Fourier transform of the measure \int \triangle^k\mu(x;\cdot)\,dx, and coincides with the classic Fourier dimension in the case that k=1. It provides quantitative control on the size of the U^k norm. The main result of the present paper is that this higher-order Fourier dimension controls the rate at which \|\mu-\mu_n\|_{U^k}\rightarrow 0, where \mu_n is an approximation to the measure \mu. This allows us to extract delicate information from the Fourier transform of a measure \mu and the interactions of its frequency components, which is not available from the L^p norms- or the decay- of the Fourier transform. In future work \cite{M4}, we apply this to obtain a differentiation theorem for singular measures.
