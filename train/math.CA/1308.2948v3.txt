In the paper, the authors find some new integral inequalities of Hermite-Hadamard type for functions whose derivatives of the n-th order are (\alpha,m)-convex and deduce some known results. As applications of the newly-established results, the authors also derive some inequalities involving special means of two positive real numbers.
