Using the notion of higher-order Fourier dimension introduced in \cite{M2} (which was a sort of psuedorandomness condition stemming from the Gowers norms of Additive Combinatorics), we prove a maximal theorem and corresponding differentiation theorem for singular measures on \R^d, d=1,2,.... This extends results begun by Hardy and Littlewood for balls in \R^d and continued by Stein \cite{stein} for spheres in \R^{d\geq 3} and Bourgain for circles in \R^2, first considered for more general spaces in \cite{rubio}, and shown to hold for some singular subsets of the reals for the first time in \cite{LabaDiff}.   Notably, unlike the more delicate of the previous results on differentiation such as \cite{Bourgain} and \cite{LabaDiff}, the assumption of higher-order Fourier dimension subsumes all of the geometric or combinatorial input necessary for one to obtain our theorem, and suggests a new approach to some problems in Harmonic Analysis.
