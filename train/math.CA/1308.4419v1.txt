We obtain the estimates of steady rates of deviations of the de Vall\'{e}e Poussin sums and interpolation analogues of sums of Vall\'{e}e Poussin from the functions that belong to the space C_{\bar{\beta}}^\psi L_s, \ 1\leq s\leq\infty and are represented through the best approximations of (\psi,\bar{\beta})-differentiable functions of this sort by trigonometric polynomials in the metric L_s
