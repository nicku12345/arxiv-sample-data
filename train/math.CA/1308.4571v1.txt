Local Tb theorems with Lp type testing conditions, which are not scale invariant, have been studied widely in the case of the Lebesgue measure. In the non-homogeneous world local Tb theorems have only been proved assuming scale invariant (L^{\infty} or BMO) testing conditions. In this paper, for the first time, we overcome these obstacles in the non-homogeneous world, and prove a non-homogeneous local Tb theorem with L2 type testing conditions. This paper is in the setting of the vertical and conical square functions defined using general measures and kernels. The proof uses various recent innovations including a Whitney averaging formula and the insertion of a Calderon-Zygmund stopping data of a fixed function in to the construction of the twisted martingale difference operators.
