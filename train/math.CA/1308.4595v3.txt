The definition of dual fusion frame presents technical problems related to the domain of the synthesis operator. The notion commonly used is the analogous to the canonical dual frame. Here a new concept of dual is studied in infinite-dimensional separable Hilbert spaces. It extends the commonly used notion and overcomes these technical difficulties. We show that with this definition in many cases dual fusion frames behave similar to dual frames. We exhibit examples of non-canonical dual fusion frames.
