In this paper, the author establishes some Hadamard-type and Bullen-type inequalities for Lipschitzian functions via Riemann Liouville fractional integral. These results have some relationships with [K.-L. Tseng, S.-R. Hwang and K.-C. Hsu, Hadamard-type and Bullen-type inequalities for Lipschitzian functions and their applications, Computers and Mathematics with Applications (2012). doi:10.1016/j.camwa.2011.12.076].
