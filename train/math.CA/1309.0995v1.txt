The objective of this manuscript is to study directly the Favard type theorem associated with the three term recurrence formula % \[ R_{n+1}(z) = \big[(1+ic_{n+1})z+(1-ic_{n+1})\big] R_{n}(z) - 4 d_{n+1} z R_{n-1}(z), \quad n \geq 1, \] % with R_{0}(z) =1 and R_{1}(z) = (1+ic_{1})z+(1-ic_{1}), where \{c_n\}_{n=1}^{\infty} is a real sequence and \{d_n\}_{n=1}^{\infty} is a positive chain sequence. We establish that there exists an unique nontrivial probability measure \mu on the unit circle for which \{R_n(z) - 2(1-m_n)R_{n-1}(z)\} gives the sequence of orthogonal polynomials. Here, \{m_n\}_{n=0}^{\infty} is the minimal parameter sequence of the positive chain sequence \{d_n\}_{n=1}^{\infty}. The element d_1 of the chain sequence, which does not effect the polynomials R_n, has an influence in the derived probability measure \mu and hence, in the associated orthogonal polynomials on the unit circle. To be precise, if \{M_n\}_{n=0}^{\infty} is the maximal parameter sequence of the chain sequence, then the measure \mu is such that M_0 is the size of its mass at z=1. An example is also provided to completely illustrates the results obtained.
