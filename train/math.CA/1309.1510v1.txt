Hahn polynomials of several variables can be defined by using the Jacobi polynomials on the simplex as a generating function. Starting from this connection, a number of properties for these two families of orthogonal polynomials are derived. It is shown that the Hahn polynomials appear as connecting coefficients between several families of orthogonal polynomials on the simplex. Closed-form formulas are derived for the reproducing kernels of the Hahn polynomials and Krawtchouck polynomials. As an application, the Poisson kernels for the Hahn polynomials and the Krawtchouck polynomials are shown to be nonnegative.
