In this paper, we consider the Fefferman-Stein decomposition of Q_{\alpha}(\mathbb{R}^{n}) and give an affirmative answer to an open problem posed by M. Essen, S. Janson, L. Peng and J. Xiao in 2000. One of our main methods is to study the structure of the predual space of Q_{\alpha}(\mathbb{R}^{n}) by the micro-local quantities. This result indicates that the norm of the predual space of Q_{\alpha}(\mathbb{R}^{n}) depends on the micro-local structure in a self-correlation way.
