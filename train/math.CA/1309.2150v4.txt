We give a new self-contained proof of Bronshtein's theorem, that any continuous root of a C^{n-1,1}-family of monic hyperbolic polynomials of degree n is locally Lipschitz, and obtain explicit bounds for the Lipschitz constant of the root in terms of the coefficients. As a by-product we reprove the recent result of Colombini, Orr\'u, and Pernazza, that a C^n-curve of hyperbolic polynomials of degree n admits a C^1-system of its roots.
