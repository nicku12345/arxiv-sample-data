Let (p_n)_n be either the q-Meixner or the q-Laguerre polynomials. We form a new sequence of polynomials (q_n)_n by considering a linear combination of two consecutive p_n: q_n=p_n+\beta_np_{n-1}, \beta_n\in \RR. Using the concept of \D-operator, we generate sequences (\beta_n)_n for which the polynomials (q_n)_n are orthogonal with respect to a measure and common eigenfunctions of a higher order q-difference operator.
