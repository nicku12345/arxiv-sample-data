The Riesz-Sobolev inequality provides a sharp upper bound for a trilinear expression involving convolution of indicator functions of sets. Equality is known to hold only for indicator functions of appropriately situated intervals. We characterize ordered triples of subsets of the real line that nearly realize equality, with quantitative bounds of power law form with the optimal exponent.   This improves on an earlier manuscript by the author in at least two respects. An excessively strong hypothesis has been replaced by the natural assumption, and the conclusion has been strengthened from a "little o(1)" statement to an explicit bound of the optimal form, up to a constant factor.
