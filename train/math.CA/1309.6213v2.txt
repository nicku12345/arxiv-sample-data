Consider the first-order linear differential equation with several retarded arguments  x^{\prime}(t)+\sum\limits_{i=1}^{m}p_{i}(t)x(\tau_{i}(t))=0,\;\;\;t\geq t_{0},  where the functions p_{i},\tau_{i}\in C([t_{0,}\infty),\mathbb{R}^{+}), for every i=1,2,\ldots,m, \tau_{i}(t)\leq t \ for t\geq t_{0} and % \lim_{t\rightarrow \infty}\tau_{i}(t)=\infty . The state of the art on the oscillation of all solutions to these equations are established especially in the case of non-monotone arguments. Examples illustrating the results are given.
