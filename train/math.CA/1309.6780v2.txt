We study the question of how much one can weaken the defining condition of BMO. Specifically, we show that if Q is a cube in \mathbb{R}^n and h:[0,\infty)\to[0,\infty) is such that h(t)\underset{t\to\infty}{\longrightarrow}\infty, then    \sup_{J \text{subcube} Q} \frac1{|J|}\int_J h(|\varphi-\frac1{|J|} \int_J\varphi |)<\infty \Longrightarrow \varphi\in BMO(Q).    Under some additional assumptions on h we obtain estimates on \|\varphi\|_{BMO} in terms of the supremum above. We also show that even though the condition h(t)\underset{t\to\infty}{\longrightarrow}\infty is not necessary for this implication to hold, it becomes necessary if one considers the dyadic BMO.
