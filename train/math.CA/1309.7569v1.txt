Using a special case of Askey's q-beta integral evaluation formula, we determine orthogonality relations for the Al-Salam--Carlitz polynomials of type II with respect to a family of measures supported on a discrete subset of \mathbb R. From spectral analysis of the corresponding second-order q-difference operator we obtain an infinite set of functions that complement the Al-Salam--Carlitz II polynomials to an orthogonal basis of the associated L^2-space.
