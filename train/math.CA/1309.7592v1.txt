We obtain some sufficient conditions for reducibility of a Schlesinger isomonodromic family with the (block) upper-triangular monodromy to the same (block) upper-triangular form via a constant gauge transformation. We also obtain integral representations of hypergeometric type for entries of upper-triangular solutions of the Schlesinger equation.
