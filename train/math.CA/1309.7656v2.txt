Just as with the Gauss hypergeometric function, particular cases of the local Heun function can be Liouvillian (that is, "elementary") functions. One way to obtain these functions is by pull-back transformations of Gauss hypergeometric equations with Liouvillian solutions. This paper presents the Liouvillian solutions of Heun's equations that are pull-backs of the parametric hypergeometric equations with cyclic or dihedral monodromy groups.
