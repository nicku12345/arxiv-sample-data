This paper investigates the errors of the solutions as well as the shadowing property of a class of nonlinear differential equations which possess unique solutions on a certain interval for any admissible initial conditions. The class of differential equations are assumed to be approximated by well-posed truncated Taylor series expansions up to a certain order obtained about certain, in general non-periodic, sampling points of the solution.
