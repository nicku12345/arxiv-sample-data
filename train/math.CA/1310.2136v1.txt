We characterize the set of all measurable functions on \RR^n possessing an A_1 majorant, denoted as \cM_{A_1}(\RR^n), by certain Banach function spaces. We prove that a function has an A_1 majorant if and only if it belongs to some Banach function space for which the Hardy-Littlewood maximal operator is bounded. This answers the question posted by G. Knese, J. M^{c}Carthy, and K. Moen.
