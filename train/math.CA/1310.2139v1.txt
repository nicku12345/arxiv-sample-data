In this note we prove the estimate M^{\sharp}_{0,s}(Tf)(x) \le c\,M_\gamma f(x) for general fractional type operators T, where M^{\sharp}_{0,s} is the local sharp maximal function and M_\gamma the fractional maximal function, as well as a local version of this estimate. This allows us to express the local weighted control of Tf by M_\gamma f. Similar estimates hold for T replaced by fractional type operators with kernels satisfying H\"{o}rmander-type conditions or integral operators with homogeneous kernels, and M_\gamma  replaced by an appropriate maximal function M_T.   We also prove two-weight, L^p_v-L^q_w estimates for the fractional type operators described above for 1<p< q<\infty and a range of q. The local nature of the estimates leads to results involving generalized Orlicz-Campanato and Orlicz-Morrey spaces.
