Let \mathcal{B} denote a collection of open bounded sets in \mathbb{R}^n, and define the associated maximal operator M_{\mathcal{B}} by  M_{\mathcal{B}}f(x) := \sup_{x \in R \in \mathcal{B}} \frac{1}{|R|}\int_R |f|.  The sharp Tauberian constant of M_{\mathcal{B}} associated to \alpha, denoted by C_{\mathcal{B}}(\alpha), is defined as  C_{\mathcal{B}}(\alpha) := \sup_{E :\, 0 < |E| < \infty}\frac{1}{|E|}\big|\big\{x \in \mathbb{R}^n:\, M_{\mathcal{B}}\chi_E (x) > \alpha\big\}\big|. Motivated by previous work of A. A. Solyanik, we show that if M_{\mathcal{B}} is the uncentered Hardy-Littlewood maximal operator associated to balls, the estimate  \lim_{\alpha \rightarrow 1^-}C_{\mathcal{B}}(\alpha) = 1  holds. Similar results for iterated maximal functions are obtained, and open problems in the field of Solyanik estimates are also discussed.
