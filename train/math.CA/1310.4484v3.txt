We prove that the energy conditions in arXiv:1302.5093v7 are implied by the fractional A2 conditions and testing conditions for the vector of fractional Riesz transforms when one measure is supported on a line. Then we apply the main theorem in arXiv:1302.5093v7 to obtain a T1 theorem for the fractional Riesz transforms when one weight is supported on a line.
