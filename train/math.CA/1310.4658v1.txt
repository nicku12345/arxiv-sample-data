Using Casorati determinants of Meixner polynomials (m_n^{a,c})_n, we construct for each pair \F=(F_1,F_2) of finite sets of positive integers a sequence of polynomials m_n^{a,c;\F}, n\in \sigma_\F, which are eigenfunctions of a second order difference operator, where \sigma_\F is certain infinite set of nonnegative integers, \sigma_\F \varsubsetneq \NN. When c and \F satisfy a suitable admissibility condition, we prove that the polynomials m_n^{a,c;\F}, n\in \sigma_\F, are actually exceptional Meixner polynomials; that is, in addition, they are orthogonal and complete with respect to a positive measure. By passing to the limit, we transform the Casorati determinant of Meixner polynomials into a Wronskian type determinant of Laguerre polynomials (L_n^\alpha)_n. Under the admissibility conditions for \F and \alpha, these Wronskian type determinants turn out to be exceptional Laguerre polynomials.
