The first part of this paper is devoted to the study of the orthogonal polynomial on the circle, with respect of a weight of type f_\alpha (\theta) = (2\cos \theta- 2\cos \theta_0)^{2\alpha} c_1 with \theta_0 \in ]0,\pi[, -1/2 <\alpha<1/2 and c_1 a sufficiently smooth function. In a second part of the paper we obtain an asymptotic of the entries (T_N f_\alpha)^{-1}_{k+1,l+1} for sufficiently large values of k,l, that provides a lower bound on the eigenvalues of this matrix.
