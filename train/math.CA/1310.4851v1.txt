In this paper, a new identity for differentiable functions is derived. A consequence of the identity is that the author establishes some new general inequalities containing all of the Hermite-Hadamard and Simpson-like type for functions whose derivatives in absolute value at certain power are harmonically convex. Some applications to special means of real numbers are also given.
