The question under consideration is Gevrey summability of power expansions of solutions to the third and fifth Painlev\'{e} equations near infinity. Methods of French and Japaneese schools are used to analyse these properties of formal power-series solutions. The results obtained are compared with the ones obtained by means of Power Geometry.
