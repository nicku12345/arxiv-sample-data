We mainly establish a monotonicity property between some special Riemann sums of a convex function f on [a,b], which in particular yields that \frac{b-a}{n+1}\sum_{i=0}^n f\left(a+i\frac{b-a}{n}\right) is decreasing while \frac{b-a}{n-1}\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} f\left(a+i\frac{b-a}{n}\right) is an increasing sequence. These give us a new refinement of the Hermitt-Hadamard inequality.   Moreover, we give a refinement of the classical Alzer's inequality together with a suitable converse to it. Applications regarding to some important convex functions are also included.
