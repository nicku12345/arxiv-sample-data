In the 1960s Cargo and Shisha proved some majorizations for the distance among quasi-arithmetic means (defined as f^{-1}(\sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i f(a_i) for any continuous, strictly monotone function f:I->R, where I is an interval, and a=(a_1,...,a_n) is a vector with entries in I, w=(w_1,...,w_n) is a sequence of corresponding weights w_i>0, w_1+...+w_n=1).   Nearly thirty years later, in 1991, P\`ales presented an iff condition for a sequence of quasi-arithmetic means to converge to another QA mean. It was closely related with the three parameters' operator (f(x)-f(z))/(f(x)-f(y)).   The author presented recently an estimate for the distance among such quasi-arithmetic means whose underlying functions satisfy some smoothness conditions. Used was the operator f -> f''/f' introduced in the 1940s by Mikusi\'nski and \L{}ojasiewicz. It is natural to look for similar estimate(s) in the case of the underlying functions not being smooth. For instance, by the way of using P\`ales' operator. This is done in the present note. Moreover, the result strengthens author's earlier estimates.
