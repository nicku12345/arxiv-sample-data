We define \lambda(r)-convergence, which is a generalization of nontangential convergence in the unit disc. We prove Fatou-type theorems on almost everywhere nontangential convergence of Poisson-Stiltjes integrals for general kernels \{\varphi_r\}, forming an approximation of identity. We prove that the bound \md0 \limsup_{r\to 1}\lambda(r) \|\varphi_r\|_\infty<\infty \emd is necessary and sufficient for almost everywhere \lambda(r)-convergence of the integrals \md0 \int_\ZT \varphi_r(t-x)d\mu(t). \emd
