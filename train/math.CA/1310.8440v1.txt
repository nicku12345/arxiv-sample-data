By using a generalization of Sturm-Liouville problems in q-difference spaces, a class of symmetric q-orthogonal polynomials with four free parameters is introduced. The standard properties of these polynomials, such as a second order q-difference equation, the explicit form of the polynomials in terms of basic hypergeometric series, a three term recurrence relation and a general orthogonality relation are presented. Some particular examples are then studied in detail.
