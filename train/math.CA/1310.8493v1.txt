Let K_{0} denote the modified Bessel function of second kind and zeroth order. In this paper we will studying the function \tilde{\omega}_{n}\left( x\right) :=\frac{\left( -x\right) ^{n}K_{0}^{\left( n\right) }\left( x\right) }{n!} for positive argument. The function \tilde{\omega}_{n} plays an important role for the formulation of the wave equation in two spatial dimensions as a retarded potential integral equation. We will prove that the growth of the derivatives \tilde{\omega}_{n}^{\left( m\right) } with respect to n can be bounded by O\left( \left( n+1\right) ^{m/2}\right)  while for small and large arguments x the growth even becomes independent of n.   These estimates are based on an integral representation of K_{0} which involves the function g_{n}\left( t\right) =\frac{t^{n}}{n!}\exp\left( -t\right)  and their derivatives. The estimates then rely on a subtle analysis of g_{n} and its derivatives which we will also present in this paper.
