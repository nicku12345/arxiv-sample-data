The aim of this work is to study new functions arising from the limit transition of the Jackson's q-Bessel functions when q\rightarrow -1. These functions coincide with the cas function for particular values of their parameters. We prove also that these functions are eigenfunction of differential-difference operators of Dunkl-type. Further, we consider special cases of the Askey-Wilson algebra AW(3) that have these operators (up to constants) as one of their three generators and whose defining relations are given in terms of anticommutators.
