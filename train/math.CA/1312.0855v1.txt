Almost everywhere strong exponential summability of Fourier series in Walsh and trigonometric systems established by Rodin in 1990. We prove, that if the growth of a function \Phi(t):[0,\infty)\to[0,\infty) is bigger than the exponent, then the strong \Phi-summability of a Walsh-Fourier series can fail everywhere. The analogous theorem for trigonometric system was proved before by one of the author of this paper.
