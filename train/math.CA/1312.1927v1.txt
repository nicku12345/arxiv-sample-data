While exploiting the generalized Parseval equality for the Mellin transform, we derive the reciprocal inverse operator in the weighted L_2-space related to the Hilbert transform on the nonnegative half-axis. Moreover, employing the convolution method, which is based on the Mellin-Barnes integrals, we prove the corresponding convolution and Titchmarsh's theorems for the half-Hilbert transform. Some applications to the solvability of a new class of singular integral equations are demonstrated. Our technique does not require the use of methods of the Riemann-Hilbert boundary value problems for analytic functions. The same approach will be applied in the forthcoming research to invert the half-Hartley transform and to establish its convolution theorem.
