This paper examines the level sets of the continuous but nowhere differentiable functions \begin{equation*} f_r(x)=\sum_{n=0}^\infty r^{-n}\phi(r^n x), \end{equation*} where \phi(x) is the distance from x to the nearest integer, and r is an integer with r\geq 2. It is shown, by using properties of a symmetric correlated random walk, that almost all level sets of f_r are finite (with respect to Lebesgue measure on the range of f), but that for an abscissa x chosen at random from [0,1), the level set at level y=f_r(x) is uncountable almost surely. As a result, the occupation measure of f_r is singular.
