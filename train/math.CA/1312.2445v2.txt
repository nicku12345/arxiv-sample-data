This article presents an elementary proof of the Implicit Function Theorem for differentiable maps F(x,y), defined on a finite-dimensional Euclidean space, with \frac{\partial F}{\partial y}(x,y) only continuous at the base point. In the case of a single scalar equation this continuity hypothesis is not required. The Inverse Function Theorem is also shown. The proofs rely on the mean-value and the intermediate-value theorems and Darboux's property (the intermediate-value property for derivatives). These proofs avoid compactness arguments, fixed-point theorems, and integration theory.
