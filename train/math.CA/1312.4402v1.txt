We present a survey on recent results about Stirling's formula. More exactly, we reffer to a method using a form of Cesaro-Stolz lemma firstly introduced in [C. Mortici Product approximations via asymptotic integration Amer. Math. Monthly 117 (5) (2010) 434-441]. As an example we improve a result obtained in [C. Mortici A substantial improvement of the Stirling formula Appl. Math. Lett. 24 (2011) no. 8 1351-1354]. Finally, some numerical computations are made.
