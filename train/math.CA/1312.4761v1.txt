In the context of radial weights we study the dimension dependence of some weighted inequalities for maximal operators. We study the growth of the A_1-constants for radial weights and show the equivalence between the uniform boundedness of these constants, a dimension-free weak L^1 estimate for the maximal operator on annuli and the condition on the weight to be decreasing and essentially constant over dyadic annuli. Each one of these conditions is shown to provide dimension-free weighted weak type L^1 estimates for the centred maximal Hardy-Littlewood operator acting on radial functions. Finally we show that the universal maximal operator is of restricted weak type on weighted L^n(\real^n) with constants uniformly bounded in dimension whenever we consider an A_1 weight.
