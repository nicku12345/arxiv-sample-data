We introduce a large family of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces \mathcal{H} \subset \mbox{Hol}(\mathbb{D}), which include the classical Dirichlet-type spaces \mathcal{D}_\alpha, by requiring normalized monomials to form a Riesz basis for \mathcal{H}. Then, after precisely evaluating the n-th optimal norm and the n-th approximant of f(z)=1-z, we completely characterize the cyclicity of functions in \mbox{Hol}(\overline{\mathbb{D}}) with respect to the forward shift.
