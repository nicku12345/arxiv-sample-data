We apply wavelets to identify the Triebel type oscillation spaces with the known Triebel-Lizorkin-Morrey spaces \dot{F}^{\gamma_1,\gamma_2}_{p,q}(\mathbb{R}^{n}). Then we establish a characterization of \dot{F}^{\gamma_1,\gamma_2}_{p,q}(\mathbb{R}^{n}) via the fractional heat semigroup. Moreover, we prove the continuity of Calder\'on-Zygmund operators on these spaces. The results of this paper also provide necessary tools for the study of well-posedness of Navier-Stokes equations.
