This report gives a rather arbitrary choice of formulas for (q-)hypergeometric orthogonal polynomials which the author missed while consulting Chapters 9 and 14 in the book "Hypergeometric orthogonal polynomials and their q-analogues" by Koekoek, Lesky and Swarttouw. The systematics of these chapters will be followed here, in particular for the numbering of subsections and of references.
