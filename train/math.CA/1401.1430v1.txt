Some Tur\'an type inequalities for Struve functions of the first kind are deduced by using various methods developed in the case of Bessel functions of the first and second kind. New formulas, like Mittag-Leffler expansion, infinite product representation for Struve functions of the first kind, are obtained, which may be of independent interest. Moreover, some complete monotonicity results and functional inequalities are deduced for Struve functions of the second kind. These results complement naturally the known results for a particular case of Lommel functions of the first kind, and for modified Struve functions of the first and second kind.
