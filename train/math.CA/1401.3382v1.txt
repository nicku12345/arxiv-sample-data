In this paper it is shown that an Ahlfors-David n-dimensional measure \mu on \mathbb{R}^d is uniformly n-rectifiable if and only if for any ball B(x_0,R) centered at \operatorname{supp}(\mu),  \int_0^R \int_{x\in B(x_0,R)} \left|\frac{\mu(B(x,r))}{r^n} - \frac{\mu(B(x,2r))}{(2r)^n} \right|^2\,d\mu(x)\,\frac{dr}r \leq c\, R^n. Other characterizations of uniform n-rectifiability in terms of smoother square functions are also obtained.
