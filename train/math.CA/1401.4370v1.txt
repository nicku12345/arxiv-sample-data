The ostrowski inequality expresses bounds on the deviation of a function from its integral mean. The aim of this paper is to establish a new inequality using weight function which generalizes the inequalities of Dragomir, Wang and Cerone .The current article obtains bounds for the deviation of a function from a combination of integral means over the end intervals covering the entire interval. A variety of earlier results are recaptured as particular instances of the current development. Applications for cumulative distribution function are also discussed.
