The main purpose of this paper is to introduce and investigate a class of q-Bernoulli, q-Euler and q-Genocchi polynomials. The q-analogues of well-known formulas are derived. The q-analogue of the Srivastava--Pint\'er addition theorem is obtained. Some new identities involving q-polynomials are proved.
