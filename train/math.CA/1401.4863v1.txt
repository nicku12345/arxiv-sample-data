Various miscellaneous functional inequalities are deduced for the so-called generalized inverse trigonometric and hyperbolic functions. For instance, functional inequalities for sums, difference and quotient of generalized inverse trigonometric and hyperbolic functions are given, as well as some Gr\"unbaum inequalities with the aid of the classical Bernoulli inequality. Moreover, by means of certain already derived bounds, bilateral bounding inequalities are obtained for the generalized hypergeometric {}_3F_2 Clausen function.
