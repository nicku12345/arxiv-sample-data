We consider translates of functions in L^2(\RRd) along an irregular set of points. Introducing a notion of pseudo-Gramian function for the irregular case, we obtain conditions for a family of irregular translates to be a Bessel sequence or Riesz sequence.   We find a representation of the canonical dual of a frame sequence \{\phi( \cdot - \lambda_k)\}_{k\in \ZZ} - where \phi is a bandlimited function - in terms of its Fourier transform.
