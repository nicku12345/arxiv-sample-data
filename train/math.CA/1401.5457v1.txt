We continue the study of local Tb theorems for square functions defined in the upper half-space (\mathbb{R}^{n+1}_+, \mu \times dt/t). Here \mu is allowed to be a non-homogeneous measure in \mathbb{R}^n. In this paper we prove a boundedness result assuming local L^q type testing conditions in the difficult range q \in (1,2). Our theorem is a non-homogeneous version of a result of S. Hofmann valid for the Lebesgue measure. It is also an extension of the recent results of M. Lacey and the first named author where non-homogeneous local L^2 testing conditions have been considered.
