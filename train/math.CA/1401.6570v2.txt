In this series of two papers, we will prove a natural matrix weighted T1 theorem for matrix kernelled CZOs. In the current paper, we will prove matrix weighted norm inequalities for matrix symbolled paraproducts via a general matrix weighted Carleson embedding theorem. Along the way, we will also provide a stopping time proof of the identification of L^p(W) as a weighted Triebel-Lizorkin space when W is a matrix A{}_p weight.
