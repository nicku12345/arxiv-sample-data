We find all polynomials solutions P_n(x) of the abstract "hypergeometric" equation L P_n(x) = \lambda_n P_n(x), where L is a linear operator sending any polynomial of degree n to a polynomial of the same degree with the property that L is two-diagonal in the monomial basis, i.e. L x^n = \lambda_n x^n + \mu_n x^{n-1} with arbitrary nonzero coefficients \lambda_n, \mu_n . Under obvious nondegenerate conditions, the polynomial eigensolutions L P_n(x) = \lambda_n P_n(x) are unique. The main result of the paper is a classification of all {\it orthogonal} polynomials P_n(x) of such type, i.e. P_n(x) are assumed to be orthogonal with respect to a nondegenerate linear functional \sigma. We show that the only solutions are: Jacobi, Laguerre (correspondingly little q-Jacobi and little q-Laguerre and other special and degenerate cases), Bessel and little -1 Jacobi polynomials.
