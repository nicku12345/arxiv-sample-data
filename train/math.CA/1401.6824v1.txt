The first aim of this paper is to prove a Gr\"uss-Voronovskaya estimate for Bernstein and for a class of Bernstein-Durrmeyer polynomials on [0, 1]. Then, Gr\"uss and Gr\"uss-Voronovskaya estimates for their corresponding operators of complex variable on compact disks are obtained. Finally, the results are extended to Bernstein-Faber polynomials attached to compact sets in the complex plane.
