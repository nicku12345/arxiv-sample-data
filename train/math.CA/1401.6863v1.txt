We consider the Calder\'on-Zygmund kernels K_ {\alpha,n}(x)=(x_i^{2n-1}/|x|^{2n-1+\alpha})_{i=1}^d in \mathbb{R}^n for 0<\alpha\leq 1 and n\in\mathbb{N}. We show that, on the plane, for 0<\alpha<1, the capacity associated to the kernels K_{\alpha,n} is comparable to the Riesz capacity C_{\frac23(2-\alpha),\frac 3 2} of non-linear potential theory. As consequences we deduce the semiadditivity and bi-Lipschitz invariance of this capacity. Furthermore we show that for any Borel set E\subset\mathbb{R}^n with finite length the L^2(\mathcal{H}^1 \lfloor E)-boundedness of the singular integral associated to K_{1,n} implies the rectifiability of the set E. We thus extend to any ambient dimension, results previously known only in the plane.
