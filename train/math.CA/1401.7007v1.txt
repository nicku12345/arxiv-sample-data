The aim of this paper is to obtain some generalized weighted Ostrowski inequalities for differentiable mappings. Some well known inequalities can be derived as special cases of the inequalities obtained here. In addition, perturbed mid-point inequality and perturbed trapezoid inequality are also obtained. The inequalities obtained here have direct applications in Numerical Integration, Probability Theory, Information Theory and Integral Operator Theory. Some of these applications are discussed.
