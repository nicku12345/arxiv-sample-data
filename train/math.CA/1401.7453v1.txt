In this paper we use the values of the Riemann Z(t)-function in order to construct certain quasi-orthonormal system of vectors. On this basis we prove a formula for microscopic interpolation of the function Z(t). Simultaneously we have obtained a new algorithm how to construct asymptotic solutions of Diophantine equation with Leibnitz coefficients. This paper is English version of the paper \cite{3} except the Appendix.
