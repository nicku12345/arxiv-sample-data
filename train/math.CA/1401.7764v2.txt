In this note we offer some log-concavity properties of certain functions related to Bessel functions of the first kind and modified Bessel functions of the first and second kind, by solving partially a recent conjecture on the log-convexity/log-concavity properties for modified Bessel functions of the first kind and their derivatives. Moreover, we give an application of the mentioned results by extending two inequalities of van der Corput to Bessel and modified Bessel functions of the first kind. Similar inequalities are proved also for modified Bessel functions of the second kind, as well as for log-concave probability density functions.
