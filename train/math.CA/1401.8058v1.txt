In this paper we study the general group classification of systems of linear second-order ordinary differential equations inspired from earlier works and recent results on the group classification of such systems. Some interesting results and subsequent Theorem arising from this particular study are discussed here. This paper considers the study of irreducible systems of second-order ordinary differential equations.
