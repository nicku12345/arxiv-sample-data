Let \frak T be a set of cylindrical tubes in \mathbb{R}^3 of length N and radius 1. If the union of the tubes has volume N^{3 - \sigma}, and each point in the union lies in tubes pointing in three quantitatively different directions, and if a technical assumption holds, then at scale N^\sigma, the tubes are clustered into rectangular slabs of dimension 1 \times N^\sigma \times N^\sigma. This estimate generalizes the graininess estimate proven by Katz-Laba-Tao. The proof is based on modeling the union of tubes with a high-degree polynomial.
