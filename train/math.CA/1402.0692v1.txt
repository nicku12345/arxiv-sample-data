In this paper our aim is to deduce some sufficient (and necessary) conditions for the close-to-convexity of some special functions and their derivatives, like Bessel functions, Struve functions, and a particular case of Lommel functions of the first kind, which can be expressed in terms of the hypergeometric function {}_1F_2. The key tool in our proofs is a result of Shah and Trimble about transcendental entire functions with univalent derivatives. Moreover, a known result of P\'olya on entire functions, the infinite product representations and some results on zeros of Bessel, Struve and Lommel functions of the first kind are used in order to achieve the main results of the paper.
