In this study, we focus on the existence of a periodic solution for the neutral nonlinear dynamic systems with delay% \[ x^{\Delta}(t)=A(t)x(t)+Q^{\Delta}\left(t,x\left(\delta_{-}(s,t)\right) \right) +G\left(t,x(t),x\left(\delta_{-}(s,t)\right) \right) . \] We utilize the new periodicity concept in terms of shifts operators, which allows us to extend the concept of periodicity to time scales where the additivity requirement t\pm T\in\mathbb{T} for all t\in\mathbb{T} and for a fixed T>0, may not hold. More, importantly, the new concept will easily handle time scales that are not periodic in the conventional way such as; \overline{q^{\mathbb{Z}}} and \cup_{k=1}^{\infty}\left[ 3^{\pm k},2.3^{\pm k}\right] \cup\left\{0\right\} . Hence, we develop a tool that enables the investigation of periodic solutions of q-difference systems. Since we are dealing with systems, in order to convert our equation to an integral systems, we resort to the transition matrix of the homogeneous Floquet system y^{\Delta}(t)=A(t)y(t) and then make use of Krasnoselskii's fixed point theorem to obtain a fixed point.
