In the present paper we propose a new approach to investigate the logistic function, commonly used in mathematical models in economics and management. The approach is based on indicating in a given time series, having a logistic trend, some characteristic points corresponding to zeroes of successive derivatives of the logistic function. We give also examples of application of this method.
