We study power series of members of a class of positive linear operators reproducing linear function and constituting a link between genuine Bernstein-Durrmeyer and classical Bernstein operators. Using the eigenstructure of the operators we give a non-quantitative convergence result towards the inverse Voronovskaya operators. We include a quantitative statement via a smoothing approach.
