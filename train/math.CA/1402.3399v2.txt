We study Riesz and Bessel potentials in the settings of Hankel transform, modified Hankel transform and Hankel-Dunkl transform. We prove sharp or qualitatively sharp pointwise estimates of the corresponding potential kernels. Then we characterize those 1\le p,q \le \infty, for which the potential operators satisfy L^p-L^q estimates. In case of the Riesz potentials, we also characterize those 1\le p,q \le \infty, for which two-weight L^p-L^q estimates, with power weights involved, hold. As a special case of our results, we obtain a full characterization of two power-weight L^p-L^q bounds for the classical Riesz potentials in the radial case. This complements an old result of Rubin and its recent reinvestigations by De N\'apoli, Drelichman and Dur\'an, and Duoandikoetxea.
