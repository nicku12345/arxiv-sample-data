We discuss Beta operators with Jacobi weights on C[0,1] for \alpha,\beta\geq-1, thus including the discussion of three limiting cases. Emphasis is on the moments and their asymptotic behavior. Extended Voronovskaya-type results and a discussion concerning the over-iteration of the operators are included.
