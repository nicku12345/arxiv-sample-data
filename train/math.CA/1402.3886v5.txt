Let W denote a matrix A_2 weight. In this paper, we implement a scalar argument using the square function to deduce square-function type results for vector-valued functions in L^2(\mathbb{R},\mathbb{C}^d). These results are then used to study the boundedness of the Hilbert transform and Haar multipliers on L^2(\mathbb{R},\mathbb{C}^d). Our proof shortens the original argument by Treil and Volberg and improves the dependence on the A_2 characteristic. In particular, we prove that the Hilbert transform and Haar multipliers map L^2(\mathbb{R},W,\mathbb{C}^d) to itself with dependence on on the A_2 characteristic at most [W]_{A_2}^{\frac{3}{2}} \log [W]_{A_2}.
