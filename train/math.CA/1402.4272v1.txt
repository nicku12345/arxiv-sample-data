Using the fact that the normalised matrix trace is the unique linear functional f on the algebra of n\times n matrices which satisfies f(I)=1 and f(AB)=f(BA) for all n\times n matrices A and B, we derive a well-known formula expressing the normalised trace of a complex matrix A as the expectation of the numerical values of A; that is the function \langle Ax,x\rangle, where x ranges the unit sphere of \mathbb{C}^n.
