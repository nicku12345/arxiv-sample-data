This paper addresses the sharpness of a weighted L^{2}-estimate for the Fourier extension operator associated to the circle, obtained by J. Bennett, A. Carbery, F. Soria and A. Vargas in 2006. A point left open in their paper was the necessity of a certain \log R-factor in the bound. Here, I show that the factor is necessary for all 1/2-Ahlfors-David regular weights on the circle, but it can be removed for s-Ahlfors-David regular weights with s \neq 1/2.
