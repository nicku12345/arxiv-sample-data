In order to approximate the Riemann--Stieltjes integral \int_a^b {f\left( t \right)dg\left( t \right)} by 2--point Gaussian quadrature rule, we introduce the quadrature rule \begin{align*} \int_{ - 1}^1 {f\left( t \right)dg\left( t \right)} \approx A f\left( { - \frac{{\sqrt 3 }}{3}} \right) + B f\left( {\frac{{\sqrt 3 }}{3}} \right), \end{align*} for suitable choice of A and B. Error estimates for this approximation under various assumptions for the functions involved are provided as well.
