We study least deviation of logarithmic derivatives of real-valued polynomials with a fixed root from zero on the segment [-1;1] in the uniform norm with the weight \sqrt{1-x^2} and without it. Basing on results of Komarov and Novak and on a certain determinant identity due to Borchardt, we also establish a criterion for best uniform approximation of continuous real-valued functions by logarithmic derivatives in terms of a Chebyshev alternance.
