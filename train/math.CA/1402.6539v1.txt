A recent conjecture by I. Ra\c{s}a asserts that the sum of the squared Bernstein basis polynomials is a convex function in [0,1]. This conjecture turns out to be equivalent to a certain upper pointwise estimate of the ratio P_n^{\prime}(x)/P_n(x) for x\geq 1, where P_n is the n-th Legendre polynomial. Here, we prove both upper and lower pointwise estimates for the ratios \big(P_n^{(\lambda)}(x)\big)^{\prime}/P_n^{(\lambda)}(x), ~x\geq 1, where P_n^{(\lambda)} is the n-th ultraspherical polynomial. In particular, we validate Ra\c{s}a's conjecture.
