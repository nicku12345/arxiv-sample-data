The stability and approximation properties of transfer functions of generalized Bessel polynomials (GBP) are investigated. Sufficient conditions are established for the GBP to be Hurwitz. It is shown that the Pad\'e approximants of e^{-s} are related to the GBP.   An infinite subset of stable Pad\'e functions useful for approximating a constant time delay is defined and its approximation properties examined. The lowpass Pad\'e functions are compared with an approximating function suggested by Budak. Basic limitations of Budak's approximation are derived.
