Let h_g^\infty be the space of harmonic functions in the unit ball that are bounded by some increasing radial function g(r) with \lim_{r\rightarrow 1} g(r)=+\infty; these spaces are called growth spaces. We describe functions in growth spaces by the Ces\`aro means of their expansions in harmonic polynomials and apply this characterization to study coefficient multipliers between growth spaces. A series of examples of multipliers is given and some results by A. L. Shields and D. L. Williams and G. Bennett, D. A. Stegenga and R. M. Timoney are generalized to harmonic functions in higher dimensions.
