In this paper we find the sharp forms and characterize the complex-valued extremizers of the adjoint Fourier restriction inequalities on the sphere \big\|\widehat{f \sigma}\big\|_{L^{p}(\mathbb{R}^{d})} \lesssim \|f\|_{L^{q}(\mathbb{S}^{d-1},\sigma)} in the cases (d,p,q) = (d,2k, q) with d,k \in \mathbb{N} and q\in \mathbb{R}^+ \cup \{\infty\} satisfying: (a) k = 2, q \geq 2 and 3 \leq d\leq 7; (b) k = 2, q \geq 4 and d \geq 8; (c) k \geq 3, q \geq 2k and d \geq 2. We also prove a sharp multilinear weighted restriction inequality, with weight related to the k-fold convolution of the surface measure.
