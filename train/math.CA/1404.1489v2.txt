We discuss a special case of a family of means defined using intersections of osculating hyperplanes to curves in R^n. Let C be the curve in R^n with vector equation x_{k}(t)=t(ln t)^{k-1},k=1,...,n. Let O_{k} be the osculating hyperplane to C at a_{k},k=1,...,n. Then we show that O_{1},...,O_{n} have a unique point of intersection, P=(i_{1},...,i_{n}), and in particular, i_{1} equals the logarithmic mean in n variables of Neuman.
