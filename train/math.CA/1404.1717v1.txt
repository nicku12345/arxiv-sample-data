On Riemann hypothesis it is proved in this paper that the arc length of the Riemann Z-curve is asymptotically equal to the double sum of local maxima of the function Z(t) on corresponding segment. This paper is English remake of our paper \cite{9}, with short appendix concerning new integral generated by Jacob's ladders added.
