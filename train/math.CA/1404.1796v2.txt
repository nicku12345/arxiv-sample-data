Given a set \mathcal{S} of positive measure on the circle and a set of integers \Lambda, one may consider the family of exponentials E\left(\Lambda\right):=\left\{ e^{i\lambda t}\right\}_{\lambda\in\Lambda} and ask whether it is a Riesz sequence in the space L^{2}\left(\mathcal{S}\right). We focus on this question in connection with some arithmetic properties of the set of frequencies. Improving a result of Bownik and Speegle, we construct a set \mathcal{S} such that E\left(\Lambda\right) is never a Riesz sequence if \Lambda contains arbitrary long arithmetic progressions of length N and step \ell=O\left(N^{1-\varepsilon}\right). On the other hand, we prove that every set \mathcal{S} admits a Riesz sequence E\left(\Lambda\right) such that \Lambda does contain arbitrary long arithmetic progressions of length N and step \ell=O\left(N\right).
