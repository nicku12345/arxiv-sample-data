It is known that the improved Cotlar's inequality B^{*}f(z) \le C M(Bf)(z), z\in\mathbb C, holds for the Beurling transform B, the maximal Beurling transform B^{*}f(z)= \displaystyle\sup_{\varepsilon >0}\left|\int_{|w|>\varepsilon}f(z-w) \frac{1}{w^2} \,dw\right|, z\in\mathbb C, and the Hardy--Littlewood maximal operator M. In this note we consider the maximal Beurling transform associated with squares, namely, B^{*}_Sf(z)=\displaystyle\sup_{\varepsilon >0}\left|\int_{w\notin Q(0,\varepsilon)}f(z-w) \frac{1}{w^2} \,dw \right|, z\in\mathbb C, Q(0,\varepsilon) being the square with sides parallel to the coordinate axis of side length \varepsilon. We prove that B_{S}^{*}f(z) \le C M^2(Bf)(z), z\in\mathbb C, where M^2=M \circ M is the iteration of the Hardy--Littlewood maximal operator, and M^2 cannot be replaced by M.
