In this paper, we introduce Hardy spaces with variable exponents defined on a probability space and develop the martingale theory of variable Hardy spaces. We prove the weak type and strong type inequalities on Doob's maximal operator and get a (1,p(\cdot),\infty)-atomic decomposition for Hardy martingale spaces associated with conditional square functions. As applications, we obtain a dual theorem and the John-Nirenberg inequalities in the frame of variable exponents. The key ingredient is that we find a condition with probabilistic characterization of p(\cdot) to replace the so-called log-H\"{o}lder continuity condition in \mathbb {R}^n.
