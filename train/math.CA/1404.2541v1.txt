We show connection formulae of local solutions of the Ramanujan equation between the origin and the infinity. These solutions are given by the Ramanujan function, the q-Airy function and the divergent basic hypergeometric series {}_2\varphi_0(0,0;-;q,x). We use two different q-Borel-Laplace resummation methods to obtain our connection formulae. We also introduce the q-Borel-Laplace transformation of level r-1, which are higher order extension of these transformations. These methods are useful to obtain an asymptotic formula of a divergent series {}_r\varphi_0(0,0,\dots ,0;-;q,x).
