Let \sigma_i, i=1,2,3, denote positive Borel measures on \mathbb{R}^n, let \mathcal{D} denote the usual collection of dyadic cubes in \mathbb{R}^n and let K:\,\mathcal{D}\to[0,\infty) be a map. In this paper we give a characterization of the trilinear embedding theorem. That is, we give a characterization of the inequality  \sum_{Q\in\mathcal{D}} K(Q)\prod_{i=1}^3\left|\int_{Q}f_i\,d\sigma_i\right| \le C \prod_{i=1}^3 \|f_i\|_{L^{p_i}(d\sigma_i)}  in terms of discrete Wolff's potential and Sawyer's checking condition, when 1<p_1,p_2,p_3<\infty and \frac1{p_1}+\frac1{p_2}+\frac1{p_3}\ge 1.
