We present a study of a specific kind of lowering operator, herein called \Lambda, which is defined as a finite sum of lowering operators, proving that this configuration can be altered, for instance, by the use of Stirling numbers. We characterize the polynomial sequences fulfilling an Appell relation with respect to \Lambda, and considering a concrete cubic decomposition of a simple Appell sequence, we prove that the polynomial component sequences are \Lambda-Appell, with \Lambda defined as previously, although by a three term sum. Ultimately, we prove the non-existence of orthogonal polynomial sequences which are also \Lambda-Appell, when \Lambda is the lowering operator \Lambda=a_{0}D+a_{1}DxD+a_{2}\left(Dx\right)^2D, where a_{0}, a_{1} and a_{2} are constants and a_{2} \neq 0. The case where a_{2}=0 and a_{1} \neq 0 is also naturally recaptured.
