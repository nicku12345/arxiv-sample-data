We give a quantitative embedding of the Muckenhoupt class A_1 into A_\infty. In particular, we show how \epsilon depends on [w]_{A_1} in the inequality which characterizes A_\infty weights: \[   \frac{w(E)}{w(Q)} \leq \biggl( \frac{|E|}{|Q|} \biggr)^\epsilon, \] where Q is any dyadic cube and E is any subset of Q. This embedding yields a sharp reverse-H\"older inequality as an easy corollary.
