We give a L^2\times L^2 \rightarrow L^2 convolution estimate for singular measures supported on transversal hypersurfaces in \mathbb{R}^n, which improves earlier results of Bejenaru, Herr & Tataru as well as Bejenaru & Herr. The arising quantities are relevant in the study of the validity of bilinear estimates for dispersive partial differential equations. We also prove a class of global, nonlinear Brascamp-Lieb inequalities with explicit constants in the same spirit.
