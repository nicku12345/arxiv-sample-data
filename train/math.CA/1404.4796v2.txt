We associate to any compact semi-algebraic set X \subset \mathbb R^n a chain complex of currents S_\ast (X) generated by integration along semi-algebraic submanifolds and we analyze the corresponding homology groups. In particular, we show that these homology groups satisfy the Eilenberg-Steenrod axioms and further, that they are isomorphic to both the ordinary singular homology groups of X and to the homology groups generated by the integral currents supported on X. Using this result and a certain neighborhood of X, we are able to prove homological mass minimization for integral currents supported on X, and verify that any cycle of X that has sufficiently small mass is a boundary.
