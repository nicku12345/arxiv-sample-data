In this paper, we study the multiple integral  \displaystyle I= \int_0^1 \int_0^1 \dots \int_0^1 f(x_1+x_2 + \dots +x_n) \, dx_1 \, dx_2 \, \dots \, dx_n. A general formula of I is presented. As an application, the integral I with f(x)= \log \Gamma(x) is evaluated. We show that the values of I share a common formula for all n \in \mathbb{N}. The subsidiary computational challenges are substantial and interesting in their own right.
