In metric of spaces L_{s}, \ 1< s\leq\infty, we obtain exact order estimates of best approximations and approximations by Fourier sums of classes of convolutions the periodic functions that belong to unit ball of space L_{1}, with generating kernel \Psi_{\beta}(t)=\sum\limits_{k=1}^{\infty}\psi(k)\cos(kt-\frac{\beta\pi}{2}), \beta\in\mathbb{R}, whose coefficients \psi(k) are such that product \psi(n)n^{1-\frac{1}{s}}, 1<s\leq\infty, can't tend to nought faster than every power function and besides, if 1<s<\infty, then \sum\limits_{k=1}^{\infty}\psi^{s}(k)k^{s-2}<\infty and if s=\infty, then \sum\limits_{k=1}^{\infty}\psi(k)<\infty.
