In this paper we consider conical square functions in the Bessel, Laguerre and Schr\"odinger settings where the functions take values in UMD Banach spaces. Following a recent paper of Hyt\"onen, van Neerven and Portal, in order to define our conical square functions, we use \gamma-radonifying operators. We obtain new equivalent norms in the Lebesgue-Bochner spaces L^p((0,\infty ),\mathbb{B}) and L^p(\mathbb{R}^n,\mathbb{B}), 1<p<\infty, in terms of our square functions, provided that \mathbb{B} is a UMD Banach space. Our results can be seen as Banach valued versions of known scalar results for square functions.
