Let 2s points y_i=-\pi\le y_{2s}<\ldots<y_1<\pi be given. Using these points, we define the points y_i for all integer indices i by the equality y_i=y_{i+2s}+2\pi. We shall write f\in\bigtriangleup^{(1)}(Y) if f is a 2\pi-periodic function and f does not decrease on [y_i, y_{i-1}] if i is odd; and f does not increase on [y_i, y_{i-1}] if i is even. We denote E_n^{(1)}(f;Y) the value of the best uniform comonotone approximation. In this article the following Theorem -- the comonotone analogue of second Jackson's Inequality -- is proved.   Theorem. If f\in\bigtriangleup^{(1)}(Y)\bigcap {\Bbb W}^r, r>2, then E_n^{(1)}(f;Y)\le \frac c{n^r},  where c=c(r,Y)=const depending only on r and Y, {\Bbb W}^r Sobolev space.
