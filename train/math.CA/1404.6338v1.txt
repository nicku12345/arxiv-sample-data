Let 2s points y_i=-\pi\le y_{2s}<\ldots<y_1<\pi be given. Using these points, we define the points y_i for all integer indices i by the equality y_i=y_{i+2s}+2\pi. We shall write f\in\bigtriangleup^{(1)}(Y) if f is a 2\pi-periodic function and f does not decrease on [y_i, y_{i-1}] if i is odd; and f does not increase on [y_i, y_{i-1}] if i is even. We denote E_n^{(1)}(f;Y) the value of the best uniform comonotone approximation. In this article the following counterexample of comonotone approximation is proved.   Example. For each k\in\Bbb N, k>3, and n\in\Bbb N there a function f(x):=f(x;s,Y,n,k) exists, such that f\in\bigtriangleup^{(1)}(Y)\bigcap{\Bbb C}^{(1)} and  E_n^{(1)}(f;Y)>B_Yn^{\frac k3 -1}\frac 1n\omega_k\left(f';\frac 1n\right),    where B_Y=const, depending only on Y and k; \omega_k is the modulus of smoothness of order k, of f.
