This article is the collection of the six research papers, recently written by the authors. In these papers authors refine the inequalities of trigonometric and hyperbolic functions such as Adamovic-Mitrinovic inequality, Cusa-Huygens inequality, Lazarevic inequality, Huygens inequality, Jordan's inequality, Carlson's inequality, Wilker's inequality, Redheffer's inequality, Wilker-Anglesio inequality, Becker-Stark inequality, Kober's inequality, Shafer's inequality and Shafer-Fink's inequality. The relation between trigonometric and hyperbolic functions has been built too. In the last paper, the sharp upper and lower bounds for the classical beta function has been established by studying the Jordan's inequality.
