We discuss a phenomenon observed by Jaak Peetre in the seventies: for small L^{p}-exponents, i.e. for 0<p<1, the Sobolev spaces W^{k,p} defined in a seemingly natural way are isomorphic to L^{p}. This says that the dual of W^{k,p} is trivial, and indicates that these spaces are highly pathological. In this note we expand on Peetre's observation, explaining in detail some points that might merit further discussion.
