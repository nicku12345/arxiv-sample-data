We continue the study of Carleman-Sobolev classes from previous joint work with G. Behm. We consider spaces denoted by W_\mathcal{M}^p, defined as abstract completions of sets of smooth functions with respect to a weighted Sobolev-flavoured norm involving derivatives of all orders. Previously we showed that these classes behaves very differently on two sides of a condition on the weight sequence \mathcal{M}. Here we prove a conjecture made in that paper; under some regularity assumptions on the weight, we show that on one side of the condition there will be a complete independence between derivatives, expressed as  W_\mathcal{M}^p\cong L^p\oplus W_{\mathcal{M}_1}^p  where \mathcal{M}_1 is the shifted sequence. On the other side, we already know that one can embed W_\mathcal{M}^p into C^{\infty}(\mathbb{R}). Thus this is an instance of a kind of phase transition.
