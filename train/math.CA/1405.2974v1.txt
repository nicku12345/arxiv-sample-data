The Sz.-Nagy--Foias model theory for C_{\cdot 0} contraction operators combined with the Beurling-Lax theorem establishes a correspondence between any two of four kinds of objects: shift-invariant subspaces, operator-valued inner functions, conservative discrete-time input/state/output linear systems, and C_{\cdot 0} Hilbert-space contraction operators. We discuss an analogue of all these ideas in the context of weighted Hardy spaces over the unit disk and an associated class of hypercontraction operators.
