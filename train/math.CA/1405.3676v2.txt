For fixed c, Prolate Spheroidal Wave Functions (PSWFs), denoted by \psi_{n, c}, form an orthogonal basis with remarkable properties for the space of band-limited functions with bandwith c. They have been largely studied and used after the seminal work of D. Slepian and his co-authors. In several applications, uniform estimates of the \psi_{n,c} in n and c, are needed. To progress in this direction, we push forward the uniform approximation error bounds and give an explicit approximation of their values at 1 in terms of the   Legendre complete elliptic integral of the first kind. Also, we give an explicit formula for the accurate approximation the eigenvalues of the Sturm-Liouville operator associated with the PSWFs.
