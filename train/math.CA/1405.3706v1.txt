It is well known that a non-constant complex-valued function f defined on the open unit disk \mathbb D is an analytic self-mapping of \D if and only if Pick matrices \left[ (1-f(z_i)\overline{f(z_j)})/(1-z_i\overline{z}_j)\right]_{i,j=1}^n are positive semidefinite for all choices of finitely many points z_i\in\D. A stronger version of the "if" part was established by Alan Hindmarsh: if all 3\times 3 Pick matrices are positive semidefinite, then f is an analytic self-mapping of \mathbb D. In this paper, we extend this result to the non-commutative setting of power series over quaternions.
