The purpose of this article is to survey certain aspects of multilinear harmonic analysis related to notions of transversality. Particular emphasis will be placed on the multilinear restriction theory for the euclidean Fourier transform, multilinear oscillatory integrals, multilinear geometric inequalities, multilinear Radon-like transforms, and the interplay between them.
