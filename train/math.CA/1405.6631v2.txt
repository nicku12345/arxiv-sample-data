Let w denote a weight in \mathbb{R}^n which belongs to the Muckenhoupt class A_\infty and let \mathsf{M}_w denote the uncentered Hardy-Littlewood maximal operator defined with respect to the measure w(x)dx. The \emph{sharp Tauberian constant} of \mathsf M_w with respect to \alpha, denoted by \mathsf{C}_w (\alpha), is defined by \[ \mathsf{C}_w (\alpha) := \sup_{E:\, 0 < w(E) < \infty}w(E)^{-1}w\big(\big\{x \in \mathbb{R}^n:\, \mathsf{M}_w \chi_E (x) > \alpha\big\}\big). \] In this paper, we show that the Solyanik estimate \[ \lim_{\alpha \rightarrow 1^-}\mathsf{C}_w(\alpha) = 1 \] holds. Following the classical theme of weighted norm inequalities we also consider the sharp Tauberian constants defined with respect to the usual uncentered Hardy-Littlewood maximal operator \mathsf M and a weight w: \[ \mathsf C ^w (\alpha) := \sup_{E:\, 0 < w(E) < \infty} w(E)^{-1} w\big(\big\{x \in \mathbb R^n:\, \mathsf{M} \chi_E (x) > \alpha\big\}\big). \] We show that we have \lim_{\alpha\to 1^{-}}\mathsf{C}^w(\alpha)=1 if and only if w\in A_\infty. As a corollary of our methods we obtain a quantitative embedding of A_\infty into A_p.
