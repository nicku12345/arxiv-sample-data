We study a.e. convergence on L^p, and Lorentz spaces L^{p,q}, p>\tfrac{2d}{d-1}, for variants of Riesz means at the critical index d(\tfrac 12-\tfrac 1p)-\tfrac12. We derive more general results for (quasi-)radial Fourier multipliers and associated maximal functions, acting on L^2 spaces with power weights, and their interpolation spaces. We also include a characterization of boundedness of such multiplier transformations on weighted L^2 spaces, and a sharp endpoint bound for Stein's square-function associated with the Riesz means.
