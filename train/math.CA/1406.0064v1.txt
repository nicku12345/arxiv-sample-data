It is well known that if \mathcal{P}_t denotes a set of power means then the mapping \mathbb{R} \ni t \mapsto \mathcal{P}_t(v) \in (\min v, \max v) is both 1-1 and onto for any non-constant sequence v = (v_1,\dots,\,v_n) of positive numbers. Shortly: the family of power means is a scale.   If I is an interval and f \colon I \rightarrow \mathbb{R} is a continuous, strictly monotone function then f^{-1}(\tfrac{1}{n} \sum f(v_i)) is a natural generalization of power means, so called quasi-arithmetic mean generated by f.   A famous folk theorem says that the only homogeneous, quasi-a\-rith\-me\-tic means are power means. We prove that, upon replacing the homogeneity requirement by an invariant-type axiom, one gets a family of quasi-arithmetic means building up a scale, too.
