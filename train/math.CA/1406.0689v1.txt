In a recent work, the authors established a refinement of the well-known 1958 result of Vietoris on nonnegative cosine polynomials.   In four places of the proof, use was made of the classical Sturm Theorem on determining the number of real roots of an algebraic polynomials in a given interval. Although absolutely rigorous, the Sturm procedure involves lengthy technical computations carried out with the help of the software MAPLE 13. This article provides such details which were omitted in the article presenting the recent work.
