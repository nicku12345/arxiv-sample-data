Given a function f holomorphic at infinity, the n-th diagonal Pad\'e approximant to f, denoted by [n/n]_f, is a rational function of type (n,n) that has the highest order of contact with f at infinity. Nuttall's theorem provides an asymptotic formula for the error of approximation f-[n/n]_f in the case where f is the Cauchy integral of a smooth density with respect to the arcsine distribution on [-1,1]. In this note, Nuttall's theorem is extended to Cauchy integrals of analytic densities on the so-called algebraic S-contours (in the sense of Nuttall and Stahl).
