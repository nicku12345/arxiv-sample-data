We introduce a topology, which we call the regional topology, on the space of all real functions on a given locally compact metric space. Next we obtain a new versions of Schauder's fixed point theorem and Ascoli's theorem. We use these theorems and the properties of the iterated remainder operator to establish conditions under which there exist solutions, with prescribed asymptotic behavior, of some difference and differential equations.
