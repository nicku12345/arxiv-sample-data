Various new identities, recurrence relations, integral representations, connection and explicit formulas are established for the Bernoulli, Euler numbers and the values of Riemann's zeta function. To do this, we explore properties of some Sheffer's sequences of polynomials related to the Kontorovich-Lebedev transform.
