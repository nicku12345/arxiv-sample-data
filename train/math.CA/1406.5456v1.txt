In this work we obtain optimal majorants and minorants of exponential type for a wide class of radial functions on \mathbb{R}^N. These extremal functions minimize the L^1(\mathbb{R}^N, |x|^{2\nu + 2 - N}dx)-distance to the original function, where \nu >-1 is a free parameter. To achieve this result we develop new interpolation tools to solve an associated extremal problem for the exponential function \mathcal{F}_{\lambda}(x) = e^{-\lambda|x|}, where \lambda >0, in the general framework of de Branges spaces of entire functions. We then specialize the construction to a particular family of homogeneous de Branges spaces to approach the multidimensional Euclidean case. Finally, we extend the result from the exponential function to a class of subordinated radial functions via integration on the parameter \lambda >0 against suitable measures. Applications of the results presented here include multidimensional versions of Hilbert-type inequalities, extremal one-sided approximations by trigonometric polynomials for a class of even periodic functions and extremal one-sided approximations by polynomials for a class of functions on the sphere \mathbb{S}^{N-1} with an axis of symmetry.
