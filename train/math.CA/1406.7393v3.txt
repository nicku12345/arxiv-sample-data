Let T be a pseudo-differential operator whose symbol belongs to the H\"ormander class S^m_{\rho,\delta} with 0\leq \delta<1, 0< \rho\leq 1, \delta \leq \rho and -(n+1)< m \leq - (n+1)(1-\rho). In present paper, we prove that if b is a locally integrable function satisfying \sup_{{\rm balls}\; B\subset \mathbb R^n} \frac{\log(e+ 1/|B|)}{(1+ |B|)^\theta} \frac{1}{|B|}\int_{B} \Big|f(x)- \frac{1}{|B|}\int_{B} f(y) dy\Big|dx <\infty for some \theta\in [0,\infty), then the commutator [b,T] is bounded on the local Hardy space h^1(\mathbb R^n) introduced by Goldberg \cite{Go}.   As a consequence, when \rho=1 and m=0, we obtain an improvement of a recent result by Yang, Wang and Chen \cite{YWC}.
