In the context of controlled differential equations, the signature is the exponential function on paths. B. Hambly and T. Lyons proved that the signature of a bounded variation path is trivial if and only if the path is tree-like. We extend Hambly-Lyons' result and their notion of tree-like paths to the setting of weakly geometric rough paths in a Banach space. At the heart of our approach is a new definition for reduced path and a lemma identifying the reduced path group with the space of signatures.
