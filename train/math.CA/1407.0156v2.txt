A general class of weighted multilinear Hardy-Ces\`aro operators that acts on the product of Lebesgue spaces and central Morrey spaces. Their sharp bounds are also obtained. In addition, we obtain sufficient and necessary conditions on weight functions so that the commutators of these weighted multilinear Hardy-Ces\`aro operators (with symbols in central BMO space) are bounded on the product of central Morrey spaces. These results extends known results on multilinear Hardy operators.
