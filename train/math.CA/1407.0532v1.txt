We present an elementary proof of a general version of Montel's theorem in several variables which is based on the use of tensor product polynomial interpolation. We also prove a Montel-Popoviciu's type theorem for functions f:\mathbb{R}^d\to\mathbb{R} for d>1. Furthermore, our proof of this result is also valid for the case d=1, differing in several points from Popoviciu's original proof. Finally, we demonstrate that our results are optimal.
