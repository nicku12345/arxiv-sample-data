In this paper we consider the relationship between the Assouad and box-counting dimension and how both behave under the operation of taking products. We introduce the notion of `equi-homogeneity' of a set, which requires a uniformity in the size of local covers at all lengths and at all points. We prove that the Assouad and box-counting dimensions coincide for sets that have equal upper and lower box-counting dimensions provided that the set `attains' these dimensions (analogous to `s-sets' when considering the Hausdorff dimension), and the set is equi-homogeneous. Using this fact we show that for any \alpha\in(0,1) and any \beta,\gamma\in(0,1) such that \beta + \gamma\geq 1 we can construct two generalised Cantor sets C and D such that \text{dim}_{B}C=\alpha\beta, \text{dim}_{B}D=\alpha\gamma, and \text{dim}_{A}C=\text{dim}_{A}D=\text{dim}_{A}(C\times D)=\text{dim}_{B}(C\times D)=\alpha.
