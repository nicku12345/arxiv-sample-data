No functions class for general measurable sets classes are known whose functions have the property of differentiability of integrals associated to such sets classes. In this paper,we give some subspaces of L^s with 1<s<\infty, whose functions are proven to have the differentiability of integrals associated to measurable sets classes in {\bf R}^n , this gives an answer to a question stated by Stein in his book Harmonic Analysis. We give also a example of some functions in these classes on {\bf R}^2 , which is continuous nowhere.
