The central idea of this article is to present a systematic approach to construct some recurrence relations for the solutions of the second-order linear difference equation of hypergeometric-type defined on the quadratic-type lattices. We introduce some recurrence relations for such solutions by also considering their applications to polynomials on the quadratic-type lattices.
