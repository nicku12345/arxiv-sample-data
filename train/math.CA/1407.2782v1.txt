The exponentially improved large-a expansion for the Hurwitz zeta function \zeta(s,a) is exploited to examine the expansion of the periodic zeta function F(a,s) in the upper half-plane of the variable a. It is shown that a double Stokes phenomenon takes place in the vicinity of the positive imaginary a-axis as |a|\ra\infty. This is a consequence of the fact that constituent parts of F(a,s) involve two Hurwitz zeta functions resulting in two parallel Stokes lines at unit distance apart. Numerical calculations confirm the theoretical predictions.
