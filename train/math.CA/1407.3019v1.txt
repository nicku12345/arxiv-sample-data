Consider the group {\mathbb{R}}^2 with the discrete topology, and denote its Fourier algebra by A({{\mathbb{R}}_{\rm d}^2}). We reformulate a theorem of V.A. Yudin as a statement about restrictions of functions in A({{\mathbb{R}}_{\rm d}^2}) to the boundary of a strictly convex domain when those functions vanish outside that boundary. We give visual proofs of that statement and a complementary one.
