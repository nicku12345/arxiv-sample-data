The theory of regular variation, in its Karamata and Bojani\'c-Karamata/de Haan forms, is long established and makes essential use of the Cauchy functional equation. Both forms are subsumed within the recent theory of Beurling regular variation, developed elsewhere. Various generalizations of the Cauchy equation, including the Go{\l}\k{a}b-Schinzel functional equation (GS), are prominent there. Here we unify their treatment by `algebraicization': extensive use of group structures introduced by Popa and Javor in the 1960s turn all the various solutions into homomorphisms, and show that (GS) is present everywhere, even if in a thick disguise.
