The theory of regular variation, in its Karamata and Bojani\'c-Karamata/de Haan forms, is long established and makes essential use of homomorphisms. Both forms are subsumed within the recent theory of Beurling regular variation, developed further here, especially certain moving averages occurring there. Extensive use of group structures leads to an algebraicization not previously encountered here, and to the approximate homomorphisms of the title. Dichotomy results are obtained: things are either very nice or very nasty. Quantifier weakening is extended, and the degradation resulting from working with limsup and liminf, rather than assuming limits exist, is studied.
