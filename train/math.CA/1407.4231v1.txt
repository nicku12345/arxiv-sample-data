It is defined \Gamma_{p,q} function, a generalize of \Gamma function. Also, we defined \psi_{p,q}-analogue of the psi function as the log derivative of \Gamma_{p,q}. For the \Gamma_{p,q} -function, are given some properties related to convexity, log-convexity and completely monotonic function. Also, some properties of \psi_{p,q}  analog of the \psi function have been established. As an application, when p\to \infty, q\to 1, we obtain all result of \cite{Valmir1} and \cite{SHA}.
