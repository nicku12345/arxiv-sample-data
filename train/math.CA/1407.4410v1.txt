For a sequence \{a_n\}_{n\geq 0} of real numbers and for a parameter 0<p<1, we define the sequence of its arithmetic means \{a^*_n\}_{n\geq 0} and the sequence of its p-binomial means \{a^p_n\}_{n\geq 0} as \begin{align*} a^*_n=\frac{1}{n+1}\sum_{i=0}^n a_i & & \textrm{and} && a^p_n=\sum_{i=0}^n\binom{n}{i}p^i(1-p)^{n-i} a_i. \end{align*} We compare the convergence of sequences \{a_n\}_{n\geq 0}, \{a_n^*\}_{n\geq 0} and \{a_n^p\}_{n\geq 0} for various 0<p<1, i.e. we analyze when the convergence of one sequence implies the convergence of the other.   While the sequence \{a^*_n\}_{n\geq 0}, known also as the sequence of Ces\`{a}ro means of a sequence, is well studied in the literature, the results about \{a^p_n\}_{n\geq 0} are hard to find. Our main result shows that, if \{a_n\}_{n\geq 0} is a sequence of non-negative real numbers such that \{a^p_n\}_{n\geq 0} converges to a\in\mathbb{R}\cup\{\infty\} for some 0<p<1, then \{a^*_n\}_{n\geq 0} also converges to a. We give an application of this result on finite Markov chains.
