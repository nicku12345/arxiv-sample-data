Let A_{\alpha}^{p}(\mathbb{B}^n;\mathbb{C}^d) be the weighted Bergman space on the unit ball \mathbb{B}^n of \mathbb{C}^n of functions taking values in \mathbb{C}^d. For 1<p<\infty let \mathcal{T}_{p,\alpha} be the algebra generated by finite sums of finite products of Toeplitz operators with bounded matrix--valued symbols (this is called the Toeplitz algebra in the case d=1). We show that every S\in \mathcal{T}_{p,\alpha} can be approximated by localized operators. This will be used to obtain several equivalent expressions for the essential norm of operators in \mathcal{T}_{p,\alpha}. We then use this to characterize compact operators in A_{\alpha}^{p}(\mathbb{B}^n;\mathbb{C}^d). The main result generalizes previous results and states that an operator in A_{\alpha}^{p}(\mathbb{B}^n;\mathbb{C}^d) is compact if only if it is in \mathcal{T}_{p,\alpha} and its Berezin transform vanishes on the boundary.
