Let G be the interior domain of a piecewise analytic Jordan curve without cusps. Let \{p_n\}_{n=0}^\infty be the sequence of polynomials that are orthonormal over G with respect to the area measure, with each p_n having leading coefficient \lambda_n>0. N. Stylianopoulos has recently proven that the asymptotic behavior of \lambda_n as n\to\infty is given by \[ \frac{n+1}{\pi}\frac{\gamma^{2n+2}}{ \lambda_n^{2}}=1-\alpha_n, \] where \alpha_n=O(1/n) as n\to\infty and \gamma is the reciprocal of the logarithmic capacity of the boundary \partial G. In this paper, we prove that the O(1/n) estimate for the error term \alpha_n is, in general, best possible, by exhibiting an example for which \[ \liminf_{n\to\infty}\,n\alpha_n>0. \] The proof makes use of the Faber polynomials, about which a conjecture is formulated.
