In this paper, we characterise compactness of finite sums of finite products of Toeplitz operators acting on the \mathbb{C}^{d}-valued weighted Bergman Space, denoted A_{\alpha}^{p}(\mathbb{B}_{n},\mathbb{C}^{d}). The main result shows that a finite sum of finite product of Toeplitz operators acting on A_{\alpha}^{p}(\mathbb{B}_n,\mathbb{C}_d) is compact if and only if its Berezin transform vanishes on the boundary of the ball.
