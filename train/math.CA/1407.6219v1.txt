A usual classification tool to study a fractal interface is the computation of its fractal dimension. But a recent method developed by Y. Heurteaux and S. Jaffard proposes to compute either weak and strong accessibility exponents or local Lp regularity exponents (the so-called p-exponent). These exponents describe locally the behavior of the interface. We apply this method to the graph of the Knopp function. The Knopp function itself has everywhere the same p-exponent. Nevertheless, using the characterization of the maxima and minima done by B. Dubuc and S. Dubuc, we will compute the p-exponent of the characteristic function of domain under the graph of F at each point (x,F(x)) and show that p-exponents, weak and strong accessibility exponents change from point to point. Furthermore we will derive a characterization of the local extrema of the function according to the values of these exponents.
