The main result of this paper is that for any 1/2 \leq s < 2 - \sqrt{2} \approx 0.5858, there is a number \sigma = \sigma(s) < s with the following property. Let \delta > 0 be small, assume that A \subset [0,1] is a (\delta,1/2)-set, and that E \subset [0,1] contains \gtrsim \delta^{-\sigma} roughly \delta^{s}-separated points. Then there exists a number t \in E such that A + tA contains \gtrsim \delta^{-s} \delta-separated points.   For \sigma = s, this is essentially a consequence of Kaufman's well-known bound for exceptional sets of projections. Our proof consists of a structural observation concerning sets, for which Kaufman's bound is near-optimal, combined with (an adaptation of) Solymosi's argument for his "4/3" sum-product theorem.
