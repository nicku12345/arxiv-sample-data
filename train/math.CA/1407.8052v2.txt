We study the linear Pfaffian systems satisfied by a certain class of hypergeometric functions, which includes Gau\ss's {}_2 F_{1}, Thomae's {}_L F_{L-1} and Appell-Lauricella's F_D. In particular, we present a fundamental system of solutions with a characteristic local behavior by means of Euler-type integral representations. We also discuss how they are related to the theory of isomonodromic deformations or Painlev\'e equations.
