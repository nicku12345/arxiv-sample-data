In this paper we deduce some tight Tur\'an type inequalities for Tricomi confluent hypergeometric functions of the second kind, which in some cases improve the existing results in the literature. We also give alternative proofs for some already established Tur\'an type inequalities. Moreover, by using these Tur\'an type inequalities, we deduce some new inequalities for Tricomi confluent hypergeometric functions of the second kind. The key tool in the proof of the Tur\'an type inequalities is an integral representation for a quotient of Tricomi confluent hypergeometric functions, which arises in the study of the infinite divisibility of the Fisher-Snedecor F distribution.
