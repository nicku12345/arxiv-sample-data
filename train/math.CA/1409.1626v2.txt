We study Fuglede's p-module of systems of measures in condensers in Euclidean spaces and on polarizable Carnot groups. We apply and generalize a result by Rodin, which provides an explicit method for finding the extremal function and the 2-module of a foliated family of curves in \mathbb R^2, to a variety of settings. In the planar case, we apply Rodin's method to obtain estimates for the conformal module of a parallelogram and of a ring domain using directional dilatations. In \mathbb R^n, we identify the extremal function and compute the p-module of images of families of connecting curves and of separating sets with respect to the plates of a condenser under homeomorphisms of certain regularity. Then we calculate the module and find the extremal measures for the spherical ring domain on polarizable Carnot groups and extend Rodin's theorem to the spherical ring domain on the Heisenberg group.
