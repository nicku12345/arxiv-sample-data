We introduce two types bilateral zeta functions, which are related to the primitive and normalized multiple sine functions respectively. Further, we establish their main properties, that is, Fourier expansions, analytic continuations, differential and difference equations, special values. By applying these results, we obtain not only some generalization of the primitive and normalized multiple sine functions but also simple construction of the multiple sine function theory.
