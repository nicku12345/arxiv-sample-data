M. Lacey and C. Thiele proved in [27] (Annals of Math. (1997)) and [28] (Annals of Math. (1999)) that the bilinear Hilbert transform maps L^{p_1}\times L^{p_2}\rightarrow L^{p} boundedly when \frac{1}{p_1}+\frac{1}{p_2}=\frac{1}{p} with 1<p_{1}, \, p_{2}\leq\infty and \frac{2}{3}<p<\infty. Whether the L^p estimates hold in the range p\in (1/2,2/3] has remained an open problem since then. In this paper, we prove that the bilinear Hilbert transform does not map \mathcal{F}L^{p'_{1}}\times L^{p_{2}}\rightarrow L^{p} for p_1<2 and L^{p_{1}}\times \mathcal{F}L^{p'_{2}}\rightarrow L^{p} for p_2<2 boundedly (Theorem 1.2). In particular, this shows that the bilinear Hilbert transform neither maps \mathcal{F}L^{p'_{1}}\times L^{p_{2}}\rightarrow L^{p} nor L^{p_{1}}\times \mathcal{F}L^{p'_{2}}\rightarrow L^{p} for \frac{1}{2}<p<\frac{2}{3}. Nevertheless, we can establish L^p estimates for the bilinear Fourier multipliers whose symbols are not identical to but arbitrarily close to that of the bilinear Hilbert transform in the full range p\in(1/2,\infty) (Theorem 1.3).
