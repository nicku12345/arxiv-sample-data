This paper concerns the approximation by the Boolean sums of Jackson operators \oplus^rJ_{k,s}(f) on the unit sphere \mathbb S^{n-1} of \mathbb{R}^{n}. We prove the following the direct and inverse theorem for \oplus^rJ_{k,s}(f): there are constants C_1 and C_2 such that \begin{equation*} C_1\|\oplus^rJ_{k,s}f-f\|_p \leq \omega^{2r}(f,k^{-1})_p \leq C_2 \max_{v\geq k}\|\oplus^rJ_{k,s}f-f\|_p \end{equation*} for any positive integer k and any pth Lebesgue integrable functions f defined on \mathbb S^{n-1}, where \omega^{2r}(f,t)_p is the modulus of smoothness of degree 2r of f. We also prove that the saturation order for \oplus^rJ_{k,s} is k^{-2r}.
