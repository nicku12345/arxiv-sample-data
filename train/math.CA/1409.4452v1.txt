It was shown in \cite{GL} that the maximal surface area of a convex set in \mathbb{R}^n with respect to a rotation invariant log-concave probability measure \gamma is of order \frac{\sqrt{n}}{\sqrt[4]{Var|X|} \sqrt{\mathbb{E}|X|}}, where X is a random vector in \mathbb{R}^n distributed with respect to \gamma. In the present paper we discuss surface area of convex polytopes P_K with K facets. We find tight bounds on the maximal surface area of P_K in terms of K. We show that \gamma(\partial P_K)\lesssim \frac{\sqrt{n}}{\mathbb{E}|X|}\cdot\sqrt{\log K}\cdot\log n for all K. This bound is better then the general bound for all K\in [2,e^{\frac{c}{{\sqrt{Var|X|}}}}]. Moreover, for all K in that range the bound is exact up to a factor of \log n: for each K\in [2,e^{\frac{c}{{\sqrt{Var|X|}}}}] there exists a polytope P_K with at most K facets such that \gamma(\partial P_K)\gtrsim \frac{\sqrt{n}}{\mathbb{E}|X|}\sqrt{\log K}. %For the measures \gamma_p with densities C_{n,p} e^{-\frac{|y|^p}{p}} (where p>0) we obtain: \gamma_p(\partial P_K)\lesssim \frac{\sqrt{n}}{\mathbb{E}X}\sqrt{\log K}, which was obtained for the standard Gaussian measure \gamma_2 by F. Nazarov.
