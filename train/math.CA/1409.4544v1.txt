In this paper we obtain new theorems about classes of exceptional sets for the Selberg's theorem C (1942). Our theorems, as based on discrete method, are not accessible for Karatsuba's theory (1984) since this theory is a continuous theory. This paper is English version of our paper \cite{8}, the results of our paper \cite{9} are added too.
