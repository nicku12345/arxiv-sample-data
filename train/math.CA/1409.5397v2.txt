Nikol'skii inequalities for various sets of functions, domains and weights will be discussed. Much of the work is dedicated to the class of algebraic polynomials of total degree n on a bounded convex domain D. That is, we study \sigma:= \sigma(D,d) for which \[ \|P\|_{L_q(D)}\le c n^{\sigma(\frac1p-\frac1q)}\|P\|_{L_p(D)},\quad 0<p\le q\le\infty, \] where P is a polynomial of total degree n. We use geometric properties of the boundary of D to determine \sigma(D,n) with the aid of comparison between domains. Computing the asymptotics of the Christoffel function of various domains is crucial in our investigation. The methods will be illustrated by the numerous examples in which the optimal \sigma(D,n) will be computed explicitly.
