By using topological methods, mainly the degree of a tangent vector field, we establish multiplicity results for T-periodic solutions of parametrized T-periodic perturbations of autonomous ODEs on a differentiable manifold M. In order to provide insights into the key notion of T-resonance, we consider the elementary situations M = \mathbb{R} and M = \mathbb{R}^2. So doing, we provide more comprehensive analysis of those cases and find improved conditions.
