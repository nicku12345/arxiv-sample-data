Let -\infty \leq a<b\leq \infty . Let f and g be differentiable functions on (a,b) and let g^{\prime }\neq 0 on (a,b). By introducing an auxiliary function H_{f,g}:=\left( f^{\prime }/g^{\prime }\right) g-f, we easily prove L'Hoipital rules for monotonicity. This offer a natural and concise way so that those rules are easier to be understood. Using our L'Hospital Piecewise Monotone Rules (for short, LPMR), we establish three new sharp inequalities for hyperbolic and trigonometric functions as well as bivariate means, which supplement certain known results.
