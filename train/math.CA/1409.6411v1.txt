In this paper, we present the necessary and sufficient conditions such that several functions involving R\left( x\right) =\psi \left( x+1/2\right) -\ln x with a parameter are completely monotone on \left( 0,\infty \right) , where \psi  is the digamma function. This generalizes some known results and verifies a conjecture posed by Chen.
