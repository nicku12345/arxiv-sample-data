A classical theorem attributed to Naimark states that, given a Parseval frame \mathcal{B} in a Hilbert space \mathcal{H}, one can embed \mathcal{H} in a larger Hilbert space \mathcal{K} so that the image of \mathcal{B} is the projection of an orthonormal basis for \mathcal{K}. In the present work, we revisit the notion of Parseval frame MRA wavelets from two papers of Paluszy\'nski, \v{S}iki\'c, Weiss, and Xiao (PSWX) and produce an analog of Naimark's theorem for these wavelets at the level of their scaling functions. We aim to make this discussion as self-contained as possible and provide a different point of view on Parseval frame MRA wavelets than that of PSWX.
