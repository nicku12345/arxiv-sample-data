The Hardy-Littlewood maximal function \mathcal{M} and the trigonometric function \sin{x} are two central objects in harmonic analysis. We prove that \mathcal{M} characterizes \sin{x} in the following way: let f \in C^{\alpha}(\mathbb{R}, \mathbb{R}) be a periodic function and \alpha > 1/2. If there exists a real number 0 < \gamma < \infty such that the averaging operator  (A_xf)(r) = \frac{1}{2r}\int_{x-r}^{x+r}{f(z)dz} has a critical point in r = \gamma for every x \in \mathbb{R}, then f(x) = a+b\sin{(cx + d)} \qquad \mbox{for some}~a,b,c,d \in \mathbb{R}. This statement can be used to derive a characterization of trigonometric functions as those nonconstant functions for which the computation of the maximal function \mathcal{M} is as simple as possible. The proof uses the Lindemann-Weierstrass theorem from transcendental number theory.
