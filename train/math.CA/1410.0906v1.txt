We will examine the electrostatic properties of exceptional and regular zeros of X_m-Laguerre and X_m-Jacobi polynomials. Since there is a close connection between the electrostatic properties of the zeros and the stability of interpolation on the system of zeros, we can deduce an Egerv\'ary-Tur\' an type result as well. The limit of the energy on the regular zeros are also investigated.
