In this paper necessary and sufficient conditions are deduced for the starlikeness of Bessel functions of the first kind and their derivatives of the second and third order by using a result of Shah and Trimble about transcendental entire functions with univalent derivatives and some Mittag-Leffler expansions for the derivatives of Bessel functions of the first kind, as well as some results on the zeros of these functions.
