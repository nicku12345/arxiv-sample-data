We study the asymptotic properties of a class of multiple orthogonal polynomials with respect to a Nikishin system generated by two measures (\sigma_1, \sigma_2) with unbounded supports ({supp}(\sigma_1) \subset \mathbb{R}_+, {supp}(\sigma_2) \subset \mathbb{R}_-), and such that the second measure \sigma_2 is discrete. The weak asymptotics for these polynomials was obtained previously by V. Sorokin. We use his result and the Riemann-Hilbert analysis to derive the strong asymptotics of these polynomials and of the reproducing kernel.
