The paper demonstrates the basic properties of the local fractional variation operators (termed fractal variation operators). The action of the operators is demonstrated for local characterization of Holderian functions. In particular, it is established that a class of such functions exhibits singular behavior under the action of fractal variation operators in infinitesimal limit. The link between the limit of the fractal variation of a function and its derivative is demonstrated. The paper presents a number of examples, including the calculation of the fractional variation of Cauchy sequences leading to the Dirac's delta-function.
