In this paper, we analyze carefully the behaviour in L^\infty(\mathbb R) of the square functions S and S_\mathcal I's, originating from ergodic theory. Firstly, we show that we can find some function f\in L^\infty(\mathbb{R}), such that Sf equals infinity on a nonzero measure set. Secondly, we can find compact supported function f\in L^\infty(\mathbb{R}) and \mathcal I such that S_\mathcal{I} f does not belong to BMO space. Finally, we show that S is bounded from L^{\infty}_c to BMO space. As a consequence, we solve an open question posed by Jones, Kaufman, Rosenblatt and Wierdl in \cite{JKRW98}. That is, S_\mathcal I are uniformly bounded in L^p(\mathbb R) with respect to \mathcal I for 2<p<\infty.
