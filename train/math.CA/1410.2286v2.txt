Given a sequence of orthonormal polynomials on \Bbb R,\{p_n\}_{n\geq 0}, with p_n of degree n, we define the discrete probability distribution \Psi_n(x) = \left(\Psi_{n,1}(x), \dots \Psi_{n,n}(x) \right) , with \Psi_{n,j}(x) = \big(\sum_{j=0}^{n-1} p_j^2(x)\big)^{-1} p_{j-1}^2(x), j=1, \dots, n. In this paper, we study the asymptotic behavior as n\to \infty of the Shannon entropy \mathcal S ((\Psi_n(x))= -\sum_{j=1}^n \Psi_{n,j}(x) \log (\Psi_{n,j}(x)), x\in (-1,1), when the orthogonality weight is  (1-x)^{\alpha}\, (1+x)^{\beta}\, h(x) , \alpha, \beta > -1, and where h is real, analytic, and positive on [-1,1]. We show that the limit  \lim_{n \to \infty} \left(\mathcal{S} ((\Psi_n(x))- \log n\right)  exists for all x\in (-1,1), but its value depends on the rationality of \arccos(x)/\pi.   For the particular case of the Chebyshev polynomials of the first and second kinds, we compare our asymptotic result with the explicit formulas for \mathcal{S} (\Psi_n(\zeta_j^{(n)})), where \{\zeta_j^{(n)}\} are the zeros of p_n, obtained previously in [A.I. Aptekarev, J.S. Dehesa, A. Martinez-Finkelshtein, and R. Ya\~nez, Constr. Approx., 30 (2009), pp. 93-119].
