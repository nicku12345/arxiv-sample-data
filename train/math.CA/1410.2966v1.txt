We prove that kernels of analytic functions of kind H_{h,\beta}(t)=\sum\limits_{k=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{\cosh kh}\cos\Big(kt-\frac{\beta\pi}{2}\Big), h>0, {\beta\in\mathbb{R}}, satisfies Kushpel's condition C_{y,2n} beginning with some number n_h which is explicitly expressed by parameter h of smoothness of the kernel. As a consequence, for all n\geqslant n_h we obtain lower bounds for Kolmogorov widths d_{2n} of functional classes that are representable as convolutions of kernel H_{h,\beta} with functions \varphi\perp1, which belong to the unit ball in the space L_{\infty}, in the space C. The obtained estimates coincide with the best uniform approximations by trigonometric polynomials for these classes. As a result, we obtain exact values for widths of mentioned classes of convolutions. Also for all n\geqslant n_h we obtain exact values for Kolmogorov widths d_{2n-1} of classes of convolutions of functions \varphi\perp1, which belong to the unit ball in the space L_1, with kernel H_{h,\beta} in the space L_1.
