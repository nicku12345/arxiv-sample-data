The classical summation and transformation theorems for very well-poised hypergeometric functions, namely, _{5}F_4(1) summation, Dougall's _{7}F_6(1) summation, Whipple's _{7}F_6(1) to _{4}F_3(1) transformation and Bailey's _{9}F_8(1) to _{9}F_8(1) transformation are extended. These extensions are derived by applying the well-known Bailey's transform method along with the classical very well-poised summation and transformation theorems for very well-poised hypergeometric functions and the Rakha and Rathie's extension of the Saalsch\"{u}tz's theorem. To show importance and applications of the discovered extensions, a number of special cases are pointed out, which leads not only to the extensions of other classical theorems for very well-poised and well-poised hypergeometric functions but also generate new hypergeometric summations and transformations.
