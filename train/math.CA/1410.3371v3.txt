In [10] Jain introduced the modified form of the Sz\'asz-Mirakjan operator, based on certain parameter 0\le\beta<1. Several modifications of the operators are available in the literature. Here we consider actual Durrmeyer variant of the operators due to [10]. It is observed here that the Durrmeyer variant has the nice properties and one need not to take any restriction on \beta in order to get convergence. We establish moments using the Tricomi's confluent hypergeometric function and Stirling numbers of first kind, also estimate some direct results
