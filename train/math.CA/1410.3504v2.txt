A closed set F is Whitney 1-regular if for each compact K\subset F, the geodesic distance in K is equivalent to the Euclidean distance. Let P be the Chevalley map defined by an integrity basis of the algebra of polynomials invariant by a reflection group, this note gives the Whitney regularity of the image by P of closed balls centered at the origin of {\mathbb R}^n. The proof uses the works of Givental', Kostov and Arnold on the symmetric group. It needs a generalization of a property of the Van der Monde determinants to the Jacobian of the Chevalley mappings.
