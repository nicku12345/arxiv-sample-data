In this paper, we introduce a new set of functions, which have the property of the completeness over a finite and infinite intervals. This family of functions, denoted for simplicity GOSWFs, are a generalization of the oblate spheroidal wave functions. They generalize also the Jacobi polynomials in some sens. The GOSWFs are nothing but the eigenfunctions of the finite weighted bilateral Laplace transform \mathcal{F}_c^{(\alpha,\beta)}. We compute this functions by two methods: In the first one we use a differential operator \mathcal{D} which commutes with \mathcal{F}_c^{(\alpha,\beta)}. In the second one we use the Gaussian quadrature method. As an application, we use the GOSWFs to invert the finite bilateral Laplace transform. We also use the GOSWFs to approximate bilateral weighted Laplace bandlimited functions and we show that they are more advantageous then other classical basis of L^2((-1,1),(1-x)^\alpha(1+x)^\beta)dx. Finally, we provide the reader by some numerical examples that illustrate the theoretical results.
