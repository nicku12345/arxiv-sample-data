In the Euclidean setting, the Fujii-Wilson-type A_\infty weights satisfy a Reverse H\"older Inequality (RHI) but in spaces of homogeneous type the best known result has been that A_\infty weights satisfy only a weak Reverse H\"older Inequality. In this paper, we compliment the results of Hyt\"onen, P\'erez and Rela and show that there exist both A_\infty weights that do not satisfy an RHI and a genuinely weaker weight class that still satisfies a weak RHI. We also show that all the weights that satisfy a weak RHI have a self-improving property but the self-improving property of the strong Reverse H\"older weights fails in a general space of homogeneous type. We prove most of these purely non-dyadic results using convenient dyadic systems and techniques.
