We give a q-analog of middle convolution for linear q-difference equations with rational coefficients. In the differential case, middle convolution is defined by Katz, and he examined properties of middle convolution in detail. In this paper, we define a q-analog of middle convolution. Moreover, we show that it also can be expressed as a q-analog of Euler transformation. The q-middle convolution transforms Fuchsian type equation to Fuchsian type equation and preserves rigidity index of q-difference equations.
