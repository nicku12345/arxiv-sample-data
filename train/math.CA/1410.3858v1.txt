We obtain order estimates for the best uniform orthogonal trigonometric approximations of 2\pi-periodic functions, whose (\psi,\beta)-derivatives belong to unit balls of spaces L_{p}, \ 1\leq p<\infty, in case at consequences \psi(k) are that product \psi(n)n^{\frac{1}{p}} can tend to zero slower than any power function and \sum\limits_{k=1}^{\infty}\psi^{p'}(k)k^{p'-2}<\infty when 1<p<\infty, \frac{1}{p}+\frac{1}{p'}=1 and \sum\limits_{k=1}^{\infty}\psi(k)<\infty when p=1. We also establish the analogical estimates in L_{s}-metric, 1< s\leq \infty, for classes of the summable (\psi,\beta)-differentiable functions, such that \parallel f_{\beta}^{\psi}\parallel_{1}\leq1.
