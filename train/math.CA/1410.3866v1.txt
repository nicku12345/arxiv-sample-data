In metric of spaces L_{s}, \ 1\leq s\leq\infty, we obtain exact in order estimates of best m-term trigonometric approximations of classes of convolutions of periodic functions, that belong to unit all of space L_{p}, \ 1\leq p\leq\infty, with generated kernel \Psi_{\beta}(t)=\sum\limits_{k=1}^{\infty}\psi(k)\cos(kt-\frac{\beta\pi}{2}), \beta\in \mathbb{R}, whose coefficients \psi(k) tend to zero not slower than geometric progression. Obtained estimates coincide in order with approximation by Fourier sums of the given classes of functions in L_{s}-metric. This fact allows to write down exact order estimates of best orthogonal trigonometric approximation and trigonometric widths of given classes.
