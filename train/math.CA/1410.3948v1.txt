In this paper, we develop the Riemann-Hilbert method to study the asymptotics of discrete orthogonal polynomials on infinite nodes with an accumulation point. To illustrate our method, we consider the Tricomi-Carlitz polynomials f_n^{(\alpha)}(z) where \alpha is a positive parameter. Uniform Plancherel-Rotach type asymptotic formulas are obtained in the entire complex plane including a neighborhood of the origin, and our results agree with the ones obtained earlier in [{\it SIAM J.\;Math.\;Anal} {\bf 25} (1994)] and [{{\it Proc.\;Amer.\;Math.\;Soc.\,}{\bf138} (2010)}].
