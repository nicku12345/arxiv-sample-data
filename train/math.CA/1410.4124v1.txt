In a companion paper, Grimshaw (Asymptotic Methods in Fluid Mechanics, 2010, pp. 71-120) has demonstrated how techniques of Borel summation can be used to elucidate the exponentially small terms that lie hidden beyond all orders of a divergent asymptotic expansion. Here, we provide an alternative derivation of the generalized solitary waves of the fifth-order Korteweg-de Vries equation. We will first optimally truncate the asymptotic series, and then smooth the Stokes line. Our method provides an explicit view of the switching-on mechanism, and thus increased understanding of the Stokes Phenomenon.
