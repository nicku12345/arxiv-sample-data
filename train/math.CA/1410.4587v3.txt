In this paper we characterize BMO in terms of the boundedness of commutators of various bilinear singular integral operators with pointwise multiplication. In particular, we study commutators of a wide class of bilinear operators of convolution type, including bilinear Calder\'on-Zygmund operators and the bilinear fractional integral operators.
