We give a complete characterization of the classes of weight functions for which the Haar wavelet system for m-dilations, m= 2,3,\ldots is an unconditional basis in L^p(\mathbb{R},w). Particulary it follows that higher rank Haar wavelets are unconditional bases in the weighted norm spaces L^p(\mathbb{R},w), where w(x) = |x|^{r}, r>p-1. These weights can have very strong zeros at the origin. Which shows that the class of weight functions for which higher rank Haar wavelets are unconditional bases is much richer than it was supposed. One of main purposes of our study is to show that weights with strong zeros should be considered if somebody is studying basis properties of a given wavelet system in a weighted norm space.
