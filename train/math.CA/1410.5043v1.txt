We derive integral representations in terms of the Macdonald functions for the square modulus s\mapsto | \Gamma ( a + i s ) |^2 of the Gamma function and its Fourier transform when a<0 and a\not= -1,-2,\ldots , generalizing known results in the case a>0. This representation is based on a renormalization argument using modified Bessel functions of the second kind, and it applies to the representation of the solutions of the Fokker-Planck equation.
