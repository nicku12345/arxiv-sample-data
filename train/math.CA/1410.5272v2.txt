In this paper it is shown that for anymeasure \mu in \mathbb{R}^d and for a non-integer 0<s<d, the Wolff energy \displaystyle{\iint_0^\infty(\frac{\mu(B(x,r))}{r^s})^2\,\frac{dr}{r}d\mu(x)} is comparable to   \iint_0^\infty(\frac{\mu(B(x,r))}{r^s} - \frac{\mu(B(x,2r))}{(2r)^s})^2\,\frac{dr}rd\mu(x), unlike in the case when s is an integer. We also study the relation with the L^2-norm of s-Riesz transforms, 0<s<1, and we provide a counterexample in the integer case.
