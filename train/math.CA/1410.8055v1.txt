We formulate a class of singular integral operators in arbitrarily many parameters using mixed type characterizing conditions. We also prove a multi-parameter representation theorem saying that a general operator in our class can be represented as an average of sums of dyadic shifts, which implies a new multi-parameter T1 theorem as a byproduct. Furthermore, an equivalence result between ours and Journ\'e's class of multi-parameter operators is established, whose proof requires the multi-parameter T1 theorem. These results generalize to arbitrarily many parameters recent results of Hyt\"onen, Martikainen, and Grau de la Herran.
