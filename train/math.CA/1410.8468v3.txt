We prove that the graph of a discontinuous n-monomial function f:\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R} is either connected or totally disconnected. Furthermore, the discontinuous monomial functions with connected graph are characterized as those satisfying a certain big graph property. Finally, the connectedness properties of the graphs of additive functions f:\mathbb{R}^d\to\mathbb{R} are studied.
