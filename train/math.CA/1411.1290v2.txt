We consider the sum of squared logarithms inequality and investigate possible connections with the theory of majorization. We also discuss alternative sufficient conditions on two sets of vectors a,b\in\mathbb{R}_+^n so that \sum_{i=1}^n(\log a_i)^2\ \leq\ \sum_{i=1}^n(\log b_i)^2\,.\notag  Generalizations of some inequalities from information theory are obtained, including a generalized information inequality and a generalized log sum inequality, which states for a,b\in\mathbb{R}_+^n and k_1,...,k_n\in [0,\infty):  \sum_{i=1}^na_i\,\log\prod_{s=1}^m(\frac{a_i}{b_i} + k_s)\ \geq\ \log\prod_{s=1}^m(1+k_s)\,.\notag
