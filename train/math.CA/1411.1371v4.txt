We derive generalized generating functions for basic hypergeometric orthogonal polynomials by applying connection relations with one free parameter to them. In particular, we generalize generating functions for the Askey-Wilson, continuous q-ultraspherical/Rogers, little q-Laguerre/Wall, and q-Laguerre polynomials. Depending on what type of orthogonality these polynomials satisfy, we derive corresponding definite integrals, infinite series, bilateral infinite series, and q-integrals.
