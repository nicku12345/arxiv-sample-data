Breitenberger's uncertainty principle on the torus \mathbb{T} and its higher-dimensional analogue on \mathbb{S}^{d-1} are well understood. We give describe an entire family of uncertainty principles on compact manifolds (M,g), which includes the classical Heisenberg-Weyl uncertainty principle (for M=B(0,1) \subset \mathbb{R}^d the unit ball with the flat metric) and the Goh-Goodman uncertainty principle (for M=\mathbb{S}^{d-1} with the canonical metric) as special cases. This raises a new geometric problem related to small-curvature low-distortion embeddings: given a function f:M \rightarrow \mathbb{R}, which uncertainty principle in our family yields the best result? We give a (far from optimal) answer for the torus, discuss disconnected manifolds and state a variety of other open problems.
