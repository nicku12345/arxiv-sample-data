In this paper we derive a new representation for the incomplete gamma function, exploiting the reformulation of the method of steepest descents by C. J. Howls (Howls, Proc. R. Soc. Lond. A 439 (1992) 373--396). Using this representation, we obtain numerically computable bounds for the remainder term of the asymptotic expansion of the incomplete gamma function \Gamma \left( { - a,\lambda a} \right) with large a and fixed positive \lambda, and an asymptotic expansion for its late coefficients. We also give a rigorous proof of Dingle's formal result regarding the exponentially improved version of the asymptotic series of \Gamma \left( { - a,\lambda a} \right).
