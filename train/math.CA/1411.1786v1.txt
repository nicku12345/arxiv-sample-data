We exhibit an algorithm to solve the following extension problem: Given a finite set E \subset \mathbb{R}^n and a function f: E \rightarrow \mathbb{R}, compute an extension F in the Sobolev space L^{m,p}(\mathbb{R}^n), p>n, with norm having the smallest possible order of magnitude, and secondly, compute the order of magnitude of the norm of F. Here, L^{m,p}(\mathbb{R}^n) denotes the Sobolev space consisting of functions on \mathbb{R}^n whose mth order partial derivatives belong to L^p(\mathbb{R}^n). The running time of our algorithm is at most C N \log N, where N denotes the cardinality of E, and C is a constant depending only on m,n, and p.
