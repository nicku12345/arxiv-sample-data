In this paper, the behavior for commutators of a class of bilinear singular integral operator associated with non-smooth kernels on the products of weighted Lebesgue spaces is considered. By some new maximal functions to control the commutators of bilinear singular integral operators and CMO functions, compactness of the commutators is proved.
