In this paper we consider the reproducing kernel thesis for boundedness and compactness for operators on \ell^2--valued Bergman-type spaces. This paper generalizes many well--known results about classical function spaces to their \ell^2--valued versions. In particular, the results in this paper apply to the weighted \ell^2--valued Bergman space on the unit ball, the unit polydisc and, more generally to weighted Fock spaces.
