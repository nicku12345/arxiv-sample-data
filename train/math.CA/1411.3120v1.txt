In this paper the discrete Sobolev inner product < p,q > =\int p(x) q(x) \,d\mu + \sum_{i=0}^r M_i \, p^{(i)}(c) \, q^{(i)}(c) is considered, where \mu is a finite positive Borel measure supported on an infinite subset of the real line, c\in\mathbb{R} and \, M_i \ge 0, \, i = 0, 1, ..., r.   Connection formulas for the orthonormal polynomials associated with < ., . > are obtained. As a consequence, for a wide class of measures \mu, we give the Mehler-Heine asymptotics in the case of the point c is a hard edge of the support of \mu. In particular, the case of a symmetric measure \mu is analyzed. Finally, some examples are presented.
