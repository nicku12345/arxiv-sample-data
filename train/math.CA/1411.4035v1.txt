S. Elaydi obtained a characterization of the stability of the null solution of the Volterra difference equation  x_n=\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} a_{n-i} x_i\textrm{,}\quad n\geq 1\textrm{,}  by localizing the roots of its characteristic equation  1-\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}a_nz^n=0\textrm{.}  The assumption that (a_n)\in\ell^1 was the single hypothesis considered for the validity of that characterization, which is an insufficient condition if the ratio R of convergence of the power series of the previous equation equals one. In fact, when R=1, this characterization conflicts with a result obtained by Erd\"os, Feller and Pollard. Here, we analyze the R=1 case and show that some parts of that characterization still hold. Furthermore, studies on stability for the R<1 case are presented. Finally, we state some new results related to stability via finite approximation.
