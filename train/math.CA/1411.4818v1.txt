We investigate the structure of the set of T-periodic solutions to periodically perturbed coupled delay differential equations on differentiable manifolds. By using fixed point index and degree-theoretic methods we prove the existence of branches of T-periodic solutions to the considered equations. As main application of our methods, we study a generalized version of the sunflower equation.
