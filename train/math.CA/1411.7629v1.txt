We compare three approaches to studying the behavior of an analytic function f(z)=\sum_{k=0}^\infty a_kz^k from its Taylor coefficients. The first is "Taylor domination" property for f(z) in the complex disk D_R, which is an inequality of the form \[ |a_{k}|R^{k}\leq C\ \max_{i=0,\dots,N}\ |a_{i}|R^{i}, \ k \geq N+1. \] The second approach is based on a possibility to generate a_k via recurrence relations. Specifically, we consider linear non-stationary recurrences of the form \[ a_{k}=\sum_{j=1}^{d}c_{j}(k)\cdot a_{k-j},\ \ k=d,d+1,\dots, \] with uniformly bounded coefficients.   In the third approach we assume that a_k=a_k(\lambda) are polynomials in a finite-dimensional parameter \lambda \in {\mathbb C}^n. We study "Bautin ideals" I_k generated by a_{1}(\lambda),\ldots,a_{k}(\lambda) in the ring {\mathbb C}[\lambda] of polynomials in \lambda.   \smallskip   These three approaches turn out to be closely related. We present some results and questions in this direction.
