We observe that the Hermite-Hadamard inequality written in the form f\left(\frac{x+y}{2}\right)\leq\frac{F(y)-F(x)}{y-x}\leq\frac{f(x)+f(y)}{2} may be viewed as an inequality between two quadrature operators f\left(\frac{x+y}{2}\right) \frac{f(x)+f(y)}{2} and a differentiation formula \frac{F(y)-F(x)}{y-x}. We extend this inequality, replacing the middle term by more complicated ones. As it turns out in some cases it suffices to use Ohlin lemma as it was done in a recent paper \cite{Rajba} however to get more interesting result some more general tool must be used. To this end we use Levin-Ste\v{c}kin theorem which provides necessary and sufficient conditions under which inequalities of the type we consider are satisfied.
