We continue with the study of the Hankel determinant,  D_{n}(t,\alpha):=\det\left(\int_{0}^{\infty}x^{j+k}w(x;t,\alpha)dx\right)_{j,k=0 }^{n-1},  generated by singularly perturbed Laguerre weight,  w(x;t,\alpha):=x^{\alpha}{\rm e}^{-x}\:{\rm e}^{-t/x}, \quad 0\leq x<\infty,\;\;\;\alpha>0,\;\;\;\;t>0,  obtained through a deformation of the Laguerre weight function,  w(x;0,\alpha):=x^{\alpha}{\rm e}^{-x},\quad 0\leq x<\infty,\;\; \alpha>0,  via the multiplicative factor {\rm e}^{-t/x}. \\ An earlier investigation was made on the finite n aspect of the problem, this has appeared in \cite{ci1}. There, it was found that the logarithm of the Hankel determinant has an integral representation in terms of a particular {\rm P_{III}}, and its derivative with t. In this paper we show that, under a double scaling, where n, the order of the Hankel matrix tends to \infty, and t, tends to 0, the scaled---and therefore, in some sense, infinite dimensional---Hankel determinant, has an integral representation in terms of the C potential, and its derivatives. The second order non-linear differential equation which the C potential satisfies, after a minor change of variables, is another {\rm P_{III}}, albeit with fewer number of parameters. \\ Expansions of the double scaled determinant for small and large parameter are obtained.
