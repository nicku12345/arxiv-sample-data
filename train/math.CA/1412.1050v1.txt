In this paper we find extremal one-sided approximations of exponential type for a class of truncated and odd functions with a certain exponential subordination. These approximations optimize the L^1(\mathbb{R}, |E(x)|^{-2}dx)-error, where E is an arbitrary Hermite-Biehler entire function of bounded type in the upper half-plane. This extends the work of Holt and Vaaler [Duke Math. Journal 83 (1996), 203-247] for the signum function. We also provide periodic analogues of these results, finding optimal one-sided approximations by trigonometric polynomials of a given degree to a class of periodic functions with exponential subordination. These extremal trigonometric polynomials optimize the L^1(\mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}, d\vartheta)-error, where \vartheta is an arbitrary nontrivial measure on \mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}. The periodic results extend the work of Li and Vaaler [Indiana Univ. Math. J. 48, No. 1 (1999), 183-236], who considered this problem for the sawtooth function with respect to Jacobi measures. Our techniques are based on the theory of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (of entire functions and of polynomials) and on the construction of suitable interpolations with nodes at the zeros of Laguerre-P\'{o}lya functions.
