We consider a two weight L^{p}(\mu) \to L^{q}(\nu)-inequality for well localized operators as defined and studied by F. Nazarov, S. Treil and A. Volberg when p=q=2. A counterexample of F. Nazarov shows that the direct analogue of these results fails for for p=q\not=2. Here a new square function testing condition is introduced and applied to characterize the two weight norm inequality. The use of the square function testing condition is also demonstrated in connection with certain positive dyadic operators.
