In this paper we obtain an extension of the set of non-local equalities by adding to it new set of local equalities. Namely, we obtain an invariant set of equalities on the set of reversely iterated integrals (energies). In other words, we obtain a new continuum set of constraints on behaviour of the function \zf,\ t\to\infty.
