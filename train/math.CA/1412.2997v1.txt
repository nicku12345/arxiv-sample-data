For a family of quasi-arithmetic means satisfying certain smoothness condition we majorize the speed of convergence of the iterative sequence of self-mappings having a mean on each entry, described in the definition of Gaussian product, to relevant mean-type mapping. We apply this result to approximate any continuous function which is invariant with respect to such a self-mappings.
