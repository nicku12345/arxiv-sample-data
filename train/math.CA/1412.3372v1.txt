The authors in \cite{alikhani} have given two examples to illustrate their results in which they have been eliminated the technical details. However, the authors in \cite{salahshur} claimed that the examples are incorrect. In fact they conjectured that the authors in \cite{alikhani} have employed the incorrect statement x-x=0 for x\in {\mathbb R}_{\mathcal F}\setminus \mathbb R to construct the examples. Here we intend to observe that the basic method used in \cite{alikhani} to prove the validity of the examples is the well-known L-U representation of a fuzzy-number valued function. In this sense, we will make use of the \alpha-level sets and show that the examples are correct.
