In these lecture notes we describe some recent work on two weight norm inequalities for fractional integral operators, also known as Riesz potentials, and for commutators of fractional integrals. These notes are based on three lectures delivered at the 6th International Course of Mathematical Analysis in Andalucia, held in Antequera, Spain, September 8-12, 2014. They are, however, greatly expanded to include both new results and many details that I did not present in my lectures due to time constraints.
