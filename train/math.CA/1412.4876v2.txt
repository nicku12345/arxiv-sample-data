We provide sharp forms of k-plane transform inequalities on the d-dimensional sphere \mathbb{S}^d and the d-dimensional hyperbolic space \mathbb{H}^d. In particular, we prove that extremizers do not exist for \mathbb{H}^d. This work is a natural extension of some results for the k-plane transform on \mathbb{R}^d.
