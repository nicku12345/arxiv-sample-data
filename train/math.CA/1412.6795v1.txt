It is well known that if Hardy-Littlewood maximal operator is bounded in space L^{p(\cdot)}[0;1] then 1/p(\cdot)\in BMO^{1/\log}. On the other hand if p(\cdot)\in BMO^{1/\log}, (1<p_{-}\leq p_{+}<\infty), then there exists c>0 such that Hardy-Littlewood maximal operator is bounded in L^{p(\cdot)+c}[0;1]. Also There exists exponent p(\cdot)\in BMO^{1/\log}, (1<p_{-}\leq p_{+}<\infty) such that Hardy-Littlewood maximal operator is not bounded in L^{p(\cdot)}[0;1]. In the present paper we construct exponent p(\cdot), (1<p_{-}\leq p_{+}<\infty), 1/p(\cdot)\in BLO^{1/\log} such that Hardy-Littlewood maximal operator is not bounded in L^{p(\cdot)}[0;1].
