We develop technical tools that enable the use of Bellman functions for BMO defined on \alpha-trees, which are structures that generalize dyadic lattices. As applications, we prove the integral John--Nirenberg inequality and an inequality relating L^1- and L^2-oscillations for BMO on \alpha-trees, with explicit constants. When the tree in question is the collection of all dyadic cubes in \mathbb{R}^n, the inequalities proved are sharp. We also reformulate the John--Nirenberg inequality for the continuous BMO in terms of special martingales generated by BMO functions. The tools presented can be used for any function class that corresponds to a non-convex Bellman domain.
