Employing the Lagrange inverting series, a solution of the transcendental equation (x-a)(x-b)=le^{x}, that can be considered a quadratic generalization of the equation defining Lambert W function, has been found in terms of Bessel orthogonal polynomials. Once again a transcendental equation can be formally solved by means of classic orthogonal polynomials, suggesting a link between Rodrigues formulas and the terms of Lagrange series. A novel representation for Bessel polynomials has been found, by means of differential identity : \left(x^{2}D\right)^{n}=x^{n+1}D^{n}x^{n-1}
