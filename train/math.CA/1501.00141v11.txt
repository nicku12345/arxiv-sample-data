The Salem problem to verify whether Fourier-Stieltjes coefficients of the Minkowski question mark function vanish at infinity is solved recently affirmatively. In this paper by using methods of classical analysis and special functions we solve a Salem-type problem about the behavior at infinity of a linear combination of the Fourier-Stieltjes transforms. Moreover, as a consequence of the Salem problem, some asymptotic relations at infinity for the Fourier-Stieltjes coefficients of a power m\in \mathbb{N} of the Minkowski question mark function are derived.
