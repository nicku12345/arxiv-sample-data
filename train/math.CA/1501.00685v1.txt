We obtain an asymptotic expansion for the sum \[S(a;w)=\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{e^{-an^2}}{n^{w}}\] as a\rightarrow 0 in |\arg\,a|<\pi/2 for arbitrary finite w>0. The result when w=2m, where m is a positive integer, is the analogue of the well-known Poisson-Jacobi transformation for the sum with m=0. Numerical results are given to illustrate the accuracy of the expansion.
