This paper studies the cardinal interpolation operators associated with the general multiquadrics, \phi_{\alpha,c}(x) = (\|x\|^2+c^2)^\alpha, x\in\mathbb{R}^d. These operators take the form \mathscr{I}_{\alpha,c}\mathbf{y}(x) = \sum_{j\in\mathbb{Z}^d}y_jL_{\alpha,c}(x-j),\quad\mathbf{y}=(y_j)_{j\in\mathbb{Z}^d},\quad x\in\mathbb{R}^d, where L_{\alpha,c} is a fundamental function formed by integer translates of \phi_{\alpha,c} which satisfies the interpolatory condition L_{\alpha,c}(k) = \delta_{0,k},\; k\in\mathbb{Z}^d.   We consider recovery results for interpolation of bandlimited functions in higher dimensions by limiting the parameter c\to\infty. In the univariate case, we consider the norm of the operator \mathscr{I}_{\alpha,c} acting on \ell_p spaces as well as prove decay rates for L_{\alpha,c} using a detailed analysis of the derivatives of its Fourier transform, \widehat{L_{\alpha,c}}.
