Let \sigma_i, i=1,\ldots,n, denote positive Borel measures on \mathbb{R}^d, let \mathcal{D} denote the usual collection of dyadic cubes in \mathbb{R}^d and let K:\,\mathcal{D}\to[0,\infty) be a~map. In this paper we give a~characterization of the n linear embedding theorem. That is, we give a~characterization of the inequality  \sum_{Q\in\mathcal{D}} K(Q)\prod_{i=1}^n\left|\int_{Q}f_i\,d\sigma_i\right| \le C \prod_{i=1}^n \|f_i\|_{L^{p_i}(d\sigma_i)}  in terms of multilinear Sawyer's checking condition and discrete multinonlinear Wolff's potential, when 1<p_i<\infty.
