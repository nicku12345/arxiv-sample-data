In this short note we show that functions in the modulation space \mathscr{F}W=\{ f: \sum_{j\in\mathbb{Z}^n}\| \hat{f}(\cdot+2\pi j)\|_{L_\infty([-\pi,\pi]^n)}<\infty \} enjoy similar recovery properties as band-limited functions. If \{\phi_\alpha\} is a regular family of cardinal interpolators, then one can build an approximand of f using the fundamental functions corresponding to \phi_\alpha. Then taking the appropriate limit, one recovers f both in norm and pointwise.
