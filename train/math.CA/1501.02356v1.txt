Extending the notion of projective means we first generalize an invariance identity related to the Carlson log given in a recent paper of P. Kahlig and J. Matkowski, and then, more generally, given a bivariate symmetric, homogeneous and monotone mean M, we give explicit formula for a rich family of pairs of M-complementary means. We prove that this method cannot be extended for higher dimension. Some examples are given and two open questions are proposed.
