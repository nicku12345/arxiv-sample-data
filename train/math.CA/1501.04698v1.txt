We provide the mathematical foundation for the X_m-Jacobi spectral theory. Namely, we present a self-adjoint operator associated to the differential expression with the exceptional X_m-Jacobi orthogonal polynomials as eigenfunctions. This proves that those polynomials are indeed eigenfunctions of the self-adjoint operator (rather than just formal eigenfunctions). Further, we prove the completeness of the exceptional X_m-Jacobi orthogonal polynomials (of degrees m, m+1, m+2, ...) in the Lebesgue--Hilbert space with the appropriate weight. In particular, the self-adjoint operator has no other spectrum.
