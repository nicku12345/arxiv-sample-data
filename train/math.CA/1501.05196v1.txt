The concept of bounded variation has been generalized in many ways. In the frame of functions taking values in Banach space, the concept of bounded semivariation is a very important generalization. The aim of this paper is to provide an accessible summary on this notion, to illustrate it with an appropriate body of examples, and to outline its connection with the integration theory due to Kurzweil.
