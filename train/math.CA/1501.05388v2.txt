We investigate conditions for logarithmic complete monotonicity of a quotient of two products of gamma functions, where the argument of each gamma function has different scaling factor. We give necessary and sufficient conditions in terms of nonnegativity of some elementary function and more practical sufficient conditions in terms of parameters. Further, we study the representing measure in Bernstein's theorem for both equal and non-equal scaling factors. This leads to conditions on parameters under which Meijer's G-function or Fox's H-function represents an infinitely divisible probability distribution on positive half-line. Moreover, we present new integral equations for both G-function and H-function. The results of the paper generalize those due to Ismail (with Bustoz, Muldoon and Grinshpan) and Alzer who considered previously the case of unit scaling factors.
