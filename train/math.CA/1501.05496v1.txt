We consider Gabor localization operators G_{\phi,\Omega} defined by two parameters, the generating function \phi of a tight Gabor frame \{\phi_\lambda\}_{\lambda \in \Lambda}, parametrized by the elements of a given lattice \Lambda \subset \Bbb{R}^2, i.e. a discrete cocompact subgroup of \Bbb{R}^2, and a lattice localization domain \Omega \subset \Bbb{R}^2 with its boundary consisting of line segments connecting points of \Lambda. We find an explicit formula for the boundary form BF(\phi,\Omega)=\text{A}_\Lambda \lim_{R\rightarrow \infty}\frac{PF(G_{\phi,R\Omega})}{R}, the normalized limit of the projection functional PF(G_{\phi,\Omega})=\sum_{i=0}^{\infty}\lambda_i(G_{\phi,\Omega})(1-\lambda_i(G_{\phi,\Omega})), where \lambda_i(G_{\phi,\Omega}) are the eigenvalues of the localization operators G_{\phi,\Omega} applied to dilated domains R\Omega, R is an integer and \text{A}_\Lambda is the area of the fundamental domain of the lattice \Lambda.
