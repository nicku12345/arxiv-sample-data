A martingale transform  T, applied to an integrable locally supported function  f, is pointwise dominated by a positive sparse operator applied to  \lvert f\rvert , the choice of sparse operator being a function of  T and  f. As a corollary, one derives the sharp  A_p bounds for martingale transforms, recently proved by Thiele-Treil-Volberg, as well as a number of new sharp weighted inequalities for martingale transforms. The (very easy) method of proof (a) only depends upon the weak-L^1 norm of maximal truncations of martingale transforms, (b) applies in the vector valued setting, and (c) has an extension to the continuous case, giving a new elementary proof of the  A_2 bounds in that setting.
