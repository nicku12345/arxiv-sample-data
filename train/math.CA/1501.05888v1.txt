In this paper, a generalized model of hematopoiesis with delays and impulses is considered. By employing the contraction mapping principle and a novel type of impulsive delay inequality, we prove the existence of a unique positive almost periodic solution of the model. It is also proved that, under the proposed conditions in this paper, the unique positive almost periodic solution is globally exponentially attractive. A numerical example is given to illustrate the effectiveness of the obtained results.
