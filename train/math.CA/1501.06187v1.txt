We present a new approach to the theory of asymptotic properties of solutions of difference equations. Usually, two sequences x,y are called asymptotically equivalent if the sequence x-y is convergent to zero i.e., x-y\in c_0, where c_0 denotes the space of all convergent to zero sequences. We replace the space c_0 by various subspaces of c_0. Our approach is based on using the iterated remainder operator. Moreover, we use the regional topology on the space of all real sequences and the `regional' version of the Schauder fixed point theorem.
