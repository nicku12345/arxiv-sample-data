We establish Hardy--Littlewood inequalities for the Heckman--Opdam transform associated to a general root datum (\mathfrak{a},\Sigma,m) that generalizes an analogous result for the spherical Fourier transform on a Riemannian symmetric space of the non-compact type due to Eguchi and Kumahara. In particular we obtain a more precise Hausdorff--Young inequality that generalizes a recent result due to Narayanan, Pasquale, and Pusti.
