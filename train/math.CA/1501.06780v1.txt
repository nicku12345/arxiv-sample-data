In this paper we improve the result about the polyconvexity of the energies from the family of isotropic volumetric-isochoric decoupled strain exponentiated Hencky energies defined in the first part of this series, i.e.    W_{_{\rm eH}}(F)= \left\{\begin{array}{lll} \frac{\mu}{k}\,e^{k\,\|{\rm dev}_n\log U\|^2}+\frac{\kappa}{2\,\widehat{k}}\,e^{\widehat{k}\,[(\log {\rm det} U)]^2}&\text{if}& {\rm det}\, F>0,\\ +\infty &\text{if} &{\rm det} F\leq 0\,, \end{array}\right.  where F=\nabla \varphi is the gradient of deformation, U=\sqrt{F^T F} is the right stretch tensor and {\rm dev}_n\log {U} is the deviatoric part of the strain tensor \log U. The main result in this paper is that in plane elastostatics, i.e. for n=2, the energies of this family are polyconvex for k\geq \frac{1}{4}, \widehat{k}\geq \frac{1}{8}, extending a previous result which proves polyconvexity for k\geq \frac{1}{3}, \widehat{k}\geq \frac{1}{8}. This leads immediately to an extension of the existence result.
