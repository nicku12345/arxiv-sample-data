We give a simple necessary and sufficient condition for maximal operators associated with radial Fourier multipliers to be bounded on L^p_{rad} and L^p for certain p greater than 2. The range of exponents obtained for the L^p_{rad} characterization is optimal for the given condition. The L^p characterization is derived from an inequality of Heo, Nazarov, and Seeger regarding a characterization of radial Fourier multipliers.
