The subject of this PhD thesis is harmonic analysis on solvable extensions of H-type groups. Let N be an H-type group and S=NA be its solvable extension of rank one. The author study the weak type 1 boundedness of suitable Hardy-Littlewood maximal functions on S and develop a Calderon-Zygmund theory on S. The previous theory is then applied to obtain a Mihlin-Hormander type theorem for spectral multipliers of a distinguished Laplacian on S.
