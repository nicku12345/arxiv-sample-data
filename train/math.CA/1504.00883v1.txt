The bivariate series \theta (q,x):=\sum _{j=0}^{\infty}q^{j(j+1)/2}x^j defines a {\em partial theta function}. For fixed q (|q|<1), \theta (q,.) is an entire function. We prove a property of stabilization of the coefficients of the Laurent series in q of the zeros of \theta. The coefficients r_k of the stabilized series are positive integers. They are the elements of a known increasing sequence satisfying the recurrence relation r_k=\sum _{\nu =1}^{\infty}(-1)^{\nu -1}(2\nu +1)r_{k-\nu (\nu +1)/2}.
