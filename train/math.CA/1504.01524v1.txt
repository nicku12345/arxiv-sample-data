The series \theta (q,x):=\sum _{j=0}^{\infty}q^{j(j+1)/2}x^j converges for |q|<1 and defines a {\em partial theta function}. For any fixed q\in (0,1) it has infinitely many negative zeros. It is known that for q taking one of the {\em spectral} values \tilde{q}_1, \tilde{q}_2, \ldots (where 0.3092493386\ldots =\tilde{q}_1<\tilde{q}_2<\cdots <1, \lim _{j\rightarrow \infty}\tilde{q}_j=1) the function \theta (q,.) has a double zero which is the rightmost of its real zeros (the rest of them being simple). For q\neq \tilde{q}_j the partial theta function has no multiple real zeros. We prove that:   1) for q\in (\tilde{q}_{j},\tilde{q}_{j+1}] the function \theta is a product of a degree 2j real polynomial without real roots and a function of the Laguerre-P\'olya class \cal{LP-I};   2) for q\in \mathbb{C}\backslash 0, |q|<1, \theta (q,x)=\prod _i(1+x/x_i), where -x_i are the zeros of \theta;   3) for any fixed q\in \mathbb{C}\backslash 0, |q|<1, the function \theta has at most finitely-many multiple zeros;   4) for any q\in (-1,0) the function \theta is a product of a real polynomial without real zeros and a function of the Laguerre-P\'olya class \cal{LP}.   5) for any fixed q\in \mathbb{C}\backslash 0, |q|<1, and for k sufficiently large, the function \theta has a zero \zeta _k close to -q^{-k}. These are all but finitely-many of the zeros of \theta.
