Every polynomial of the form P=(x+1)(x^{n-1}+c_1x^{n-2}+\cdots +c_{n-1}) is representable as Schur-Szeg\H{o} composition of n-1 polynomials of the form (x+1)^{n-1}(x+a_i), where the numbers a_i are unique up to permutation. We give necessary and sufficient conditions upon the possible values of the 8-vector whose components are the number of positive, zero, negative and complex roots of a real polynomial P and the number of positive, zero, negative and complex among the quantities a_i corresponding to P. A similar result is proved about entire functions of the form e^xR, where R is a polynomial.
