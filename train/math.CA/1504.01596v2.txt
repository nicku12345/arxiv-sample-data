With the help of recent adjacent dyadic constructions by Hyt\"onen and the author, we give an alternative proof of results of Lechner, M\"uller and Passenbrunner about the L^p-boundedness of shift operators acting on functions f \in L^p(X;E) where 1 < p < \infty, X is a metric space and E is a UMD space.
