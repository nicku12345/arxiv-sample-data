We construct multiple representations relative to different bases of the generalized Tschebyscheff polynomials of second kind. We build the change-of-basis matrices between the generalized Tschebyscheff of the second kind polynomial basis and Bernstein polynomial basis. Also, we provide an explicit closed from of The generalized Polynomials of degree r less than or equal n in terms of the Bernstein basis of fixed degree n.
