Each degree n+k polynomial of the form (x+1)^k(x^n+c_1x^{n-1}+\cdots +c_n), k\in \mathbb{N}, is representable as Schur-Szeg\H{o} composition of n polynomials of the form (x+1)^{n+k-1}(x+a_j). We study properties of the affine mapping \Phi _{n,k}~:~(c_1,\ldots ,c_n) \mapsto (\sigma _1, \ldots ,\sigma _n), where \sigma _i are the elementary symmetric polynomials of the numbers a_j. We study also properties of a similar mapping for functions of the form e^xP, where P is a polynomial, P(0)=1, and we extend the Descartes rule to them.
