Recently, a new fractional derivative called the conformable fractional derivative is given on based basic limit definition derivative in [4]. Then, the fractional versions of chain rules, exponential functions, Gronwalls inequality, integration by parts, Taylor power series expansions is developed in [5]. In this paper, we present existence and uniqueness theorems for sequential linear conformable fractional differential equations.
