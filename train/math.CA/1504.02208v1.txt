Given two polynomials P,q we consider the following question: "how large can the index of the first non-zero moment \tilde{m}_k=\int_a^b P^k q be, assuming the sequence is not identically zero?". The answer K to this question is known as the moment Bautin index, and we provide the first general upper bound: K\leqslant 2+\mathrm{deg} q+3(\mathrm{deg} P-1)^2. The proof is based on qualitative analysis of linear ODEs, applied to Cauchy-type integrals of certain algebraic functions.   The moment Bautin index plays an important role in the study of bifurcations of periodic solution in the polynomial Abel equation y'=py^2+\varepsilon qy^3 for p,q polynomials and \varepsilon \ll 1. In particular, our result implies that for p satisfying a well-known generic condition, the number of periodic solutions near the zero solution does not exceed 5+\mathrm{deg} q+3\mathrm{deg}^2 p. This is the first such bound depending solely on the degrees of the Abel equation.
