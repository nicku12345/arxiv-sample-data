Each degree n polynomial in one variable of the form (x+1)(x^{n-1}+c_1x^{n-2}+\cdots +c_{n-1}) is representable in a unique way as a Schur-Szeg\H{o} composition of n-1 polynomials of the form (x+1)^{n-1}(x+a_i), see \cite{Ko1}, \cite{AlKo} and \cite{Ko2}. Set \sigma _j:=\sum _{1\leq i_1<\cdots <i_j\leq n-1}a_{i_1}\cdots a_{i_j}. The eigenvalues of the affine mapping (c_1,\ldots ,c_{n-1})\mapsto (\sigma _1,\ldots ,\sigma _{n-1}) are positive rational numbers and its eigenvectors are defined by hyperbolic polynomials (i.e. with real roots only). In the present paper we prove interlacing properties of the roots of these polynomials.
