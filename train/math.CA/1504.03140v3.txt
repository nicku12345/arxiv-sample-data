Following a previous article we continue our study on non-terminating hypergeometric series with one free parameter, which aims to find arithmetical constraints for a given hypergeometric series to admit a gamma product formula. In this article we exploit the concepts of duality and reciprocity not only to extend already obtained results to a larger region but also to strengthen themselves substantially. Among other things we are able to settle the rationality and finiteness conjectures posed in the previous article.
