Let \mu be a finite positive Borel measure supported on R, \LL[f] =xf''+(\alpha+1-x)f' with \alpha>-1, or \LL[f] =\frac{1}{2}f''-xf', and m a natural number. We study algebraic, analytic and asymptotic properties of the sequence of monic polynomials \{Q_n\}_{n>m} orthogonal with respect to the operator \LL. We also provide a fluid dynamics model for the zeros of these polynomials.
