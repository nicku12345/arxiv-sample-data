In this paper, the multilinear fractional strong maximal operator \mathcal{M}_{\mathcal{R},\alpha} associated with rectangles and corresponding multiple weights A_{(\vec{p},q),\mathcal{R}} are introduced. Under the dyadic reverse doubling condition, a necessary and sufficient condition for two-weight inequalities is given. As consequences, we first obtain a necessary and sufficient condition for one-weight inequalities. Then, we give a new proof for the weighted estimates of multilinear fractional maximal operator \mathcal{M}_\alpha associated with cubes and multilinear fractional integral operator \mathcal{I}_{\alpha}, which is quite different and simple from the proof known before.
