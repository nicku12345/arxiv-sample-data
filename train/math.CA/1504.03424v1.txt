Let d\ge 1, \ell\in\Z^d, m\in \mathbb Z^+ and \theta_i, i=1,\dots,m  are fixed, distinct and nonzero real numbers. We show that the m-(sub)linear version below of the Ratnakumar and Shrivastava \cite{RS1} Littlewood-Paley square function T(f_1,\dots , f_m)(x)=\Big(\sum\limits_{\ell\in\Z^d}|\int_{\mathbb{R}^d}f_1(x-\theta_1 y)\cdots f_m(x-\theta_m y)e^{2\pi i \ell \cdot y}K (y)dy|^2\Big)^{1/2}  is bounded from L^{p_1}(\mathbb{R}^d) \times\cdots\times L^{p_m}(\mathbb{R}^d)  to L^p(\mathbb{R}^d)  when 2\le p_i<\infty satisfy 1/p=1/p_1+\cdots+1/p_m and 1\le p<\infty. Our proof is based on a modification of an inequality of Guliyev and Nazirova \cite{GN} concerning multilinear convolutions.
