Nuij's theorem states that if a polynomial p\in \mathbb{R}[z] is hyperbolic (i.e., has only real roots) then p+sp' is also hyperbolic for any s\in \mathbb{R}. We study other perturbations of hyperbolic polynomials of the form p_a(z,s): =p(z) +\sum_{k=1}^d a_ks^kp^{(k)}(z). We give a full characterization of those a= (a_1, \dots, a_d) \in \mathbb{R}^d for which p_a(z,s) is a pencil of hyperbolic polynomials. We give also a full characterization of those a= (a_1, \dots, a_d) \in \mathbb{R}^d for which the associated families p_a(z,s) admit universal determinantal representations. In fact we show that all these sequences come from special symmetric Toeplitz matrices.
