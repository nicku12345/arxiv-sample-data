In this paper, we introduce a new analogue of Lorentz polynomials based on (p,q)-integers and we call it as (p,q)-Lorentz polynomials. We obtain quantitative estimate in the Voronovskaja's type thoerem and exact orders in simultaneous approximation by the complex (p,q)-Lorentz polynomials of degree n, where q > p > 1 attached to analytic functions in compact disks of the complex plane.
