Suppose that we are given two distinct points, P_1 and P_2, in the interior of a triangle, T. Is there always an ellipse inscribed in T which also passes through P_1 and P_2 ? If yes, how many such ellipses ? We answer those questions in this paper. It turns out that, except for P_1 and P_2 on a union of three line segments, there are four such ellipses which pass through P_1 and P_2. We also answer a similar question if instead P_1 and P_2 lie on the boundary of T. Finally, an interesting related question, is the following: Given a point, P, in the interior of a triangle, T, and a real number, r, is there always an ellipse inscribed in T which passes through P and has slope r at P ? Again, if yes, how many such ellipses ? The answer is somewhat different than for the two point case without specifying a slope. There are cases where no such ellipse exists.
