The series \theta (q,x):=\sum _{j=0}^{\infty}q^{j(j+1)/2}x^j converges for q\in [0,1), x\in \mathbb{R}, and defines a {\em partial theta function}. For any fixed q\in (0,1) it has infinitely many negative zeros. For q taking one of the {\em spectral} values \tilde{q}_1, \tilde{q}_2, \ldots (where 0.3092493386\ldots =\tilde{q}_1<\tilde{q}_2<\cdots <1, \lim _{j\rightarrow \infty}\tilde{q}_j=1) the function \theta (q,.) has a double zero y_j which is the rightmost of its real zeros (the rest of them being simple). For q\neq \tilde{q}_j the partial theta function has no multiple real zeros. We prove that \tilde{q}_j=1-\pi /2j+(\log j)/8j^2+O(1/j^2) and y_j=-e^{\pi}e^{-(\log j)/4j+O(1/j)}.
