This paper deals with monic orthogonal polynomials generated by a Geronimus canonical spectral transformation of the Laguerre classical measure: \[ \frac{1}{x-c}x^{\alpha }e^{-x}dx+N\delta (x-c), \] for x\in[0,\infty), \alpha>-1, a free parameter N\in \mathbb{R}_{+} and a shift c<0. We analyze the asymptotic behavior (both strong and relative to classical Laguerre polynomials) of these orthogonal polynomials as n tends to infinity.
