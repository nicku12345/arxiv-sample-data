In this paper we establish asymptotic results for Christoffel functions with respect to measures supported on Jordan curves having a Radon-Nikodym derivative with a jump singularity. We extend the results known for measures supported in the interval  [-1,1]  to more general sets, for example a system of Jordan curves, using polynomial inverse images. It is shown that the asymptotic limit can be written in terms of the equilibrium measure or Green's function.
