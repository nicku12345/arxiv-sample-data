We consider the nonlocal KPP-Fisher equation u_t(t,x) = u_{xx}(t,x) + u(t,x)(1-(K *u)(t,x)) which describes the evolution of population density u(t,x) with respect to time t and location x. The non-locality is expressed in terms of the convolution of u(t, \cdot) with kernel K(\cdot) \geq 0, \int_{\mathbb{R}} K(s)ds =1. The restrictions K(s), s \geq 0, and K(s), s \leq 0, are responsible for interactions of an individual with his left and right neighbors, respectively. We show that these two parts of K play quite different roles as for the existence and uniqueness of traveling fronts to the KPP-Fisher equation. In particular, if the left interaction is dominant, the uniqueness of fronts can be proved, while the dominance of the right interaction can induce the co-existence of monotone and oscillating fronts. We also present a short proof of the existence of traveling waves without assuming various technical restrictions usually imposed on K.
