In this paper we study continuous kernels on compact two point homogeneous spaces which are positive definite and zonal (isotropic). Such kernels were characterized by R. Gangolli some forty years ago and are very useful for solving scattered data interpolation problems on the spaces. In the case the space is the d-dimensional unit sphere, J. Ziegel showed in 2013 that the radial part of a continuous positive definite and zonal kernel is continuously differentiable up to order \lfloor (d-1)/2 \rfloor in the interior of its domain. The main issue here is to obtain a similar result for all the other compact two point homogeneous spaces.
