We study the asymptotic expansion for the Landau constants G_n, \begin{equation*} \pi G_{n}\sim \ln(16N)+\gamma+\sum^{\infty}_{k=1}\frac{\alpha_k}{N^k} ~~\mbox{as} ~ n\rightarrow\infty, \end{equation*} where N=n+1, and \gamma is Euler's constant. We show that the signs of the coefficients \alpha_{k} demonstrate a periodic behavior such that (-1)^{\frac {l(l+1)} 2} \alpha_{l+1}< 0 for all l. We further prove a conjecture of Granath which states that (-1)^{\frac {l(l+1)} 2} \varepsilon_l(N)<0 for l=0,1,2,\cdots and n=0,1,2,\cdots, \varepsilon_l(N) being the error due to truncation at the l-th order term.   Consequently, we also obtain the sharp bounds up to arbitrary orders of the form   \begin{equation*}   \ln(16N)+\gamma+\sum_{k=1}^{p}\frac{\alpha_{k}}{N^{k}}<\pi G_{n}<\ln(16N)+\gamma+\sum_{k=1}^{q}\frac{\alpha_{k}}{N^{k}}   \end{equation*} for all n=0,1,2\cdots, all p=4s+1,\; 4s+2 and q=4m,\; 4m+3, with s=0,1,2,\cdots and m=0, 1, 2,\cdots.
