We present a method to study the behavior of a power series of type f(x):=\sum_{n=0}^\infty (-1)^n c_n\frac{x^{2n+1}}{(2n+1)!} when x\to\infty.   We apply our method to study the function f(t):=\int_0^t\frac{dx}{x}\int_0^x\frac{dy}{y}\int_0^y\frac{dz}{z}\bigl\{ \sin x+\sin(x-y)-\sin(x-z)-\sin(x-y+z)\bigr\}. We will derive various different representations of f(t) by means of which it will be shown that \lim_{t\to+\infty}f(t)=0, disproving a conjecture by Z. Silagadze, claiming that this limit equals -\pi^3/12.
