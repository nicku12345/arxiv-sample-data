In this paper various notions of convexity of real functions with respect to Chebyshev systems defined over arbitrary subsets of the real line are introduced. As an auxiliary notion, a concept of a relevant divided difference and also a related lower Dinghas type derivative are also defined. The main results of the paper offer various characterizations of the convexity notions in terms of the nonnegativity of a generalized divided difference and the corresponding lower Dinghas type derivative.
