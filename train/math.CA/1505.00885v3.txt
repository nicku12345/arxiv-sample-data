Higher dimensional analogs of the Painlev\'e equations have been proposed from various aspects. In recent studies, 4-dimensional analogs of the Painlev\'e equations were classified into 40 types. The aim of the present paper is to geometrically characterize these 40 types of equations. For this purpose, we study the autonomous limit of these equations and degeneration of their spectral curves. We obtain two functionally independent conserved quantities H_1 and H_2 for each system. We construct fibrations whose fiber at a general point h_i  is the spectral curve of the system with H_i=h_i for i=1, 2. The singular fibers at H_{i}=\infty are one of the degenerate curves of genus 2 classified by Namikawa and Ueno. Liu's algorithm enables us to give degeneration type of spectral curves for our 40 types of integrable systems. This result is analogous to the following observation; spectral curve fibrations of the autonomous 2-dimensional Painlev\'e equations P_{\rm I}, P_{\rm II}, P_{\rm IV}, P_{\rm III}^{D_8}, P_{\rm III}^{D_7}, P_{\rm III}^{D_6}, P_{V} and P_{\rm VI} are elliptic surfaces with the singular fiber at H=\infty of Dynkin type   E_8^{(1)}, E_7^{(1)}, E_6^{(1)}, D_8^{(1)}, D_7^{(1)}, D_6^{(1)}, D_5^{(1)} and D_4^{(1)}, respectively.
