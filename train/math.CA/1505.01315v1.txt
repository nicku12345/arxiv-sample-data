We study well-posedness of sweeping processes with stochastic perturbations generated by a fractional Brownian motion and convergence of associated numerical schemes. To this end, we first prove new existence, uniqueness and approximation results for deterministic sweeping processes with bounded p-variation and next we apply them to the stochastic case.
