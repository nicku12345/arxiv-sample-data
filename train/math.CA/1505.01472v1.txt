The logarithmic convexity of restrictions of the Beta functions to rays parallel to the main diagonal and the functional equation \[ \phi\left( x+1\right) =\frac{x\left( x+k\right) }{\left( 2x+k+1\right) \left( 2x+k\right) }\phi\left( x\right) ,\ \ \ \ \ \ x>0, \] for k>0 allow to get a characterizations of the Beta function. This fact and a notion of the beta-type function lead to a new characterization of the Gamma function.
