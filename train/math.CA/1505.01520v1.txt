The aim of this paper is to establish some new inequalities similar to the Ostrowski's inequalities which are more generalized than the inequalities of Dragomir and Cerone. The current article obtains bounds for the deviation of a function from a combination of integral means over the end intervals covering the entire interval. Some new purterbed results are obtained. Application for cumulative distribution function is also discussed.
