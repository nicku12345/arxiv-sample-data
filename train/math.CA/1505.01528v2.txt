In this contribution we consider sequences of monic polynomials orthogonal with respect to the standard Freud-like inner product involving a quartic potential   \left\langle p,q\right\rangle_{M}=\int_{\mathbb{R}}p(x)q(x)e^{-x^{4}+2tx^{2}}dx+Mp(0)q(0).   We analyze some properties of these polynomials, such as the ladder operators and the holonomic equation that they satisfy and, as an application, we give an electrostatic interpretation of their zero distribution in terms of a logarithmic potential interaction under the action of an external field. It is also shown that the coefficients of their three term recurrence relation satisfy a nonlinear difference string equation. Finally, an equation of motion for their zeros in terms of their dependence on t is given.
