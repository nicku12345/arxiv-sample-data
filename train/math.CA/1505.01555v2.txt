In this paper we review the physical applications of the generalized Lambert function recently defined by the first author. Among these applications we mention the eigenstate anomaly of the H_2^+ ion, the two dimensional two-body problem in general relativity, the stability analysis of delay differential equations and water-wave applications. We also point out that the inverse Langevin function is nothing else but a specially parametrized generalized Lambert function.
