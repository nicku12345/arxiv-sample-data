For any Calder\'on-Zygmund operator  T, any weight  w, and  \alpha >1, the operator  T is bounded as a map from  L ^{1} (M _{ L \log\log L (\log\log\log L) ^{\alpha } } w ) into weak-L^1(w). The interest in questions of this type goes back to the beginnings of the weighted theory, with prior results, due to Coifman-Fefferman, P\'erez, and Hyt\"onen-P\'erez, on the  L (\log L) ^{\epsilon } scale. Also, for square functions  S f, and weights  w \in A_p, the norm of  S from  L ^p (w) to weak-L^p (w),  2\leq p < \infty , is bounded by  [w] _{A_p}^{1/2} (1+\log [w] _{A_ \infty }) ^{1/2} , which is a sharp estimate.
