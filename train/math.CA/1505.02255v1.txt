In theory and practice of elastic straight rods, the statically indeterminate reactions acted by perfect constraints are commonly believed not to depend on the flexural stiffness EJ. We solve exactly two elastica problems in order to obtain hypergeometrically (helped by Lagrange, Lauricella, Appell), the true displacements upon which the forces method is founded. As a consequence, the above reactions are found to depend on stiffness: the presumptive independence credited as general, is far from being always true, but, quite the contrary, is valid only within a first-order approximation.
