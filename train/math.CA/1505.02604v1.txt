We consider Chebyshev polynomials, T_n(z), for infinite, compact sets \frak{e} \subset \mathbb{R} (that is, the monic polynomials minimizing the sup-norm, \Vert T_n \Vert_{\frak{e}}, on \frak{e}). We resolve a 45+ year old conjecture of Widom that for finite gap subsets of \mathbb{R}, his conjectured asymptotics (which we call Szeg\H{o}-Widom asymptotics) holds. We also prove the first upper bounds of the form \Vert T_n \Vert_{\frak{e}} \leq Q C({\frak{e}})^n (where C(\frak{e}) is the logarithmic capacity of \frak{e}) for a class of \frak{e}'s with an infinite number of components, explicitly for those \frak{e} \subset \mathbb{R} that obey a Parreau-Widom condition.
