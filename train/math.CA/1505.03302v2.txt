Whereas Lie had linearized scalar second order ordinary differential equations (ODEs) by point transformations and later Chern had extended to the third order by using contact transformation, till recently no work had been done for higher order or systems of ODEs. Lie had found a unique class defined by the number of infinitesimal symmetry generators but the more general ODEs were not so classified. Recently classifications of higher order and systems of ODEs were provided. In this paper we relate contact symmetries of scalar ODEs with point symmetries of reduced systems. We define new type of transformations that build up this relation and obtain equivalence classes of scalar third order ODEs linearizable via these transformations. Four equivalence classes of such equations are seen to exist.
