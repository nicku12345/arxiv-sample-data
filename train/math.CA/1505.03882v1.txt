In this work we extend consideration of the polynomial Carleson operator to the setting of a Radon transform acting along the paraboloid in \mathbb{R}^{n+1} for n \geq 2. Inspired by work of Stein and Wainger on the original polynomial Carleson operator, we develop a method to treat polynomial Carleson operators along the paraboloid via van der Corput estimates. A key new step in the approach of this paper is to approximate a related maximal oscillatory integral operator along the paraboloid by a smoother operator, which we accomplish via a Littlewood-Paley decomposition and the use of a square function. The most technical aspect then arises in the derivation of bounds for oscillatory integrals involving integration over lower-dimensional sets. The final theorem applies to polynomial Carleson operators with phase belonging to a certain restricted class of polynomials with no linear terms and whose homogeneous quadratic part is not a constant multiple of the defining function |y|^2 of the paraboloid in \mathbb{R}^{n+1}.
