We show that for any dimension d\ge3, one can obtain Wolff's L^{(d+2)/2} bound on Kakeya-Nikodym maximal function in \mathbb R^d for d\ge3 without the induction on scales argument. The key ingredient is to reduce to a 2-dimensional L^2 estimate with an auxiliary maximal function. We also prove that the same L^{(d+2)/2} bound holds for Nikodym maximal function for any manifold (M^d,g) with constant curvature, which generalizes Sogge's results for d=3 to any d\ge3. As in the 3-dimensional case, we can handle manifolds of constant curvature due to the fact that, in this case, two intersecting geodesics uniquely determine a 2-dimensional totally geodesic submanifold, which allows the use of the auxiliary maximal function.
