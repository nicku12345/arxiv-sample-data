In this paper, we establish an integral expression for the Dunkl kernel in the context of Dihedral group of an arbitrary order by using the results in \cite{M-Y-Vk} where a construction of the Dunkl intertwining operator for a large set of regular parameter functions is provided. We introduce a differential equations systems that leads to the explicit expression of the Dunkl Kernel whenever an appropriate solution of it is obtained. In particular, an explicit expression of the Dunkl kernel E_k(x,y) is given when one of its argument x or y is invariant under the action of a known reflection in the dihedral group. We obtain also a generating series for the homogeneous components E_m(x,y), m\in\mathbb{Z}^{+}, of the Dunkl kernel from which we derive new sharp estimates for the Dunkl kernel when the parameter function k satisfies \mathrm{Re}(k)>-\nu, \nu an arbitrary nonnegative integer, which, up to our knowledge, is the largest context for such estimates so far.
