This paper is in continuation of our work in \cite{PNM}, wherein we introduced generalized Baskakov Kantorovich operators K_n^a(f;x) and established some approximation properties e.g. local approximation, weighted approximation, simultaneous approximation and A-statistical convergence. Also, we discussed the rate of convergence for functions having a derivative coinciding a.e. with a function of bounded variation. The purpose of this paper is to study the bivariate extension of the operators K_n^a(f;x) and discuss results on the degree of approximation, Voronovskaja type theorems and their first order derivatives in polynomial weighted spaces.
