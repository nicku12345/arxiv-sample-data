We assume that \Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^{d+1}, d \geq 2, is a uniform domain with lower d-Ahlfors-David regular and d-rectifiable boundary. We show that if \mathcal{H}^d|_{\partial \Omega} is locally finite, then the Hausdorff measure \mathcal{H}^d is absolutely continuous with respect to the harmonic measure \omega on \partial \Omega, apart from a set of \mathcal{H}^d-measure zero.
