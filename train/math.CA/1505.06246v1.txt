In this article, certain symmetry identities for the 2-variable Apostol type polynomials are derived. By taking suitable values of parameters and indices, the symmetry identities for the special cases of the 2-variable Apostol type polynomials are established. Further, the symmetry identities for certain members belonging to the 2-variable Apostol type polynomials are also considered.
