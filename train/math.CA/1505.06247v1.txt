By using the method developed in the paper [G.Pantsulaia, G.Giorgadze, On some applications of infinite-dimensional cellular matrices, {\it Georg. Inter. J. Sci. Tech., Nova Science Publishers,} Volume 3, Issue 1 (2011), 107-129], it is obtained a representation in an explicit form of the particular solution of the linear non-homogeneous ordinary differential equation of the higher order whose coefficients are real-valued simple functions.
