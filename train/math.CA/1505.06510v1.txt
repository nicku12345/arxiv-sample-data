In this paper we deal with the task of uniformly approximating an L-biLipschitz curve by means of piecewise linear ones. This is rather simple if one is satisfied to have approximating functions which are L'-biLipschitz, for instance this was already done with L'= 4L in [Daneri-Pratelli, Lemma 5.5]. The main result of this paper is to do the same with L'=L+ \varepsilon (which is of course the best possible result); in the end, we generalize the result to the case of closed curves.
