In this paper we will investigate the solutions and stability of the generalized variant of Wilson's functional equation  (E):\;\;\;\; f(xy)+\chi(y)f(\sigma(y)x)=2f(x)g(y),\; x,y\in G, where G is a group, \sigma is an involutive morphism of G and \chi is a character of G. (a) We solve (E) when \sigma is an involutive automorphism, and we obtain some properties about solutions of (E) when \sigma is an involutive anti-automorphism. (b) We obtain the Hyers Ulam stability of equation (E). As an application, we prove the superstability of the functional equation f(xy)+\chi(y)f(\sigma(y)x)=2f(x)f(y),\; x,y\in G.
