In this paper we study the solutions and stability of the generalized Wilson's functional equation \int_{G}f(xty)d\mu(t)+\int_{G}f(xt\sigma(y))d\mu(t)=2f(x)g(y),\; x,y\in G, where G is a locally compact group, \sigma is a continuous involution of G and \mu is an idempotent complex measure with compact support and which is \sigma-invariant. We show that \int_{G}g(xty)d\mu(t)+\int_{G}g(xt\sigma(y))d\mu(t)=2g(x)g(y),\; x,y\in G if f\neq 0 and \int_{G}f(t.)d\mu(t)\neq 0. We also study some stability theorems of that equation and we establish the stability on noncommutaive groups of the classical Wilson's functional equation f(xy)+\chi(y)f(x\sigma(y))=2f(x)g(y)\; x,y\in G, where \chi is a unitary character of G.
