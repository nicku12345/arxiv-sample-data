There is no unified method to solve the fractional differential equation. The type of derivative here used in this paper is of Jumarie formulation, for the several differential equations studied. Here we develop an algorithm to solve the linear fractional differential equation composed via Jumarie fractional derivative in terms of Mittag-Leffler function; and show its conjugation with ordinary calculus. In these fractional differential equations the one parameter Mittag-Leffler function plays the role similar as exponential function used in ordinary differential equations.
