In the present paper, we introduce a Choldowsky type generalization of the q Favard-Szasz operators and obtain weighted statistical approximation properties of these operators. We also establish the rates of statistical convergence by means of the modulus of continuity and the Lipschitz type maximal function. Further, we study the local approximation properties of these operators.
