In 1991, Ursell gave a strong form of Watson's lemma for the Laplace integral \[\int_0^\infty e^{-xt}f(t)\,dt\qquad (x\rightarrow+\infty) \] in which the amplitude function f(t) is regular at the origin and possesses a Maclaurin expansion valid in 0\leq t\leq R. He showed that if the asymptotic series for the integral as x\rightarrow+\infty is truncated after rx terms, where 0<r<R, then the resulting remainder is exponentially small of order O(e^{-rx}). In this note we extend this result to include situations when f(t) has a branch point at t=0 and when x is a complex variable satisfying |\arg\,x|<\pi/2.
