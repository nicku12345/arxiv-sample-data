Let n,m\geq 1, U\subset\mathbb R^n open. In this paper we provide a sharp solution to the following Whitney distortion extension problems: (a) Let \phi:U\to \mathbb R^n be a C^m map. If E\subset U is compact (with some geometry) and the restriction of \phi to E is an almost isometry with small distortion, how to decide when there exists a C^m(\mathbb R^n) one-to-one and onto almost isometry \Phi:\mathbb R^n\to \mathbb R^n with small distortion which agrees with \phi in a neighborhood of E and a Euclidean motion A:\mathbb R^n\to \mathbb R^n away from E. (b) Let \phi:U\to \mathbb R^n be C^{\infty} map. If E\subset U is compact (with some geometry) and the restriction of \phi to E is an almost isometry with small distortion, how to decide when there exists a C^{\infty}(\mathbb R^n) one-to-one and onto almost isometry \Phi:\mathbb R^n\to \mathbb R^n with small distortion which agrees with \phi in a neighborhood of E and a Euclidean motion A:\mathbb R^n\to \mathbb R^n away from E. Our results complement those of [14,15,20] where there, E is a finite set. In this case, the problem above is also a problem of interpolation and alignment of data in \mathbb R^n.
