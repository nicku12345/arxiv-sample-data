In this paper, we introduce a Kantorovich type generalization of q-Bernstein-Stancu operators. We study the convergence of the introduced operators and also obtain the rate of convergence by these operators in terms of the modulus of continuity. Further, we study local approximation property and Voronovskaja type theorem for the said operators. We show comparisons and some illustrative graphics for the convergence of operators to a certain function.
