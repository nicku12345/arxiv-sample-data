Let \mu be a finite Radon measure in \mathbb{R}^d with polynomial growth of degree n, although not necessarily n-AD-regular. We prove that under some geometric conditions on \mu that are closely related to rectifiability and involve the so-called \beta-numbers of Jones, David and Semmes, all singular integral operators with an odd and sufficiently smooth Calder\'on-Zygmund kernel are bounded in L^2(\mu). As a corollary, we obtain a lower bound for the Lipschitz harmonic capacity of a compact set in \mathbb{R}^d only in terms of its metric and geometric properties.
