In 1985, Bloom characterized the boundedness of the commutator [b,H] as a map between a pair of weighted L^{p} spaces, where both weights are in A_p. The characterization is in terms of a novel BMO condition. We give a 'modern' proof of this result, in the case of p=2. In a subsequent paper, this argument will be used to generalize Bloom's result to all Calder\'on-Zygmund operators and dimensions.
