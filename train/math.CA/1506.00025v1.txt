The Sard theorem from 1942 requires that a mapping f:\mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^m is of class C^k, k > \max (n-m,0). In 1957 Duvovitski\u{\i} generalized Sard's theorem to the case of C^k mappings for all k. Namely he proved that, for almost all y\in \mathbb{R}^m, \mathcal{H}^{\ell}(C_f \cap f^{-1}(y))=0 where \ell = \max(n-m-k+1,0), {\mathcal H}^{\ell} denotes the Hausdorff measure, and C_f is the set of critical points of f. In 2001 De Pascale proved that the Sard theorem holds true for Sobolev mappings of the class W_{\rm loc}^{k,p}(\mathbb{R}^n,\mathbb{R}^m), k>\max(n-m,0) and p>n. We will show that also Dubovitski\u{\i}'s theorem can be generalized to the case of W_{\rm loc}^{k,p}(\mathbb{R}^n,\mathbb{R}^m) mappings for all k\in\mathbb{N} and p>n.
