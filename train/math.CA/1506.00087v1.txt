In this article, the 2-iterated Sheffer polynomials are introduced by means of generating function and operational representation. Using the theory of Riordan arrays and relations between the Sheffer sequences and Riordan arrays, a determinantal definition for these polynomials is established. The quasi-monomial and other properties of these polynomials are derived. The generating function, determinantal definition, quasi-monomial and other properties for some new members belonging to this family are also considered.
