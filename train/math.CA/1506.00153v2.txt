Among subsets of Euclidean space with prescribed measure, for which sets is the L^q norm of the Fourier transform of the indicator function maximized? Various partial results concerning this question are established, including the existence of maximizers and the identification of maximizers as ellipsoids for exponents sufficiently close to even integers, for various combinations of dimensions and exponents.   This revision improves on the original draft by treating exponents close to arbitrary even integers greater than 2, in arbitrary dimensions.
