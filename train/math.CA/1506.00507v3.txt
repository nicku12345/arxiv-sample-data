We provide a sufficient geometric condition for \mathbb{R}^n to be countably (\mu,m) rectifiable of class \mathscr{C}^{1,\alpha} (using the terminology of Federer), where \mu is a Radon measure having positive lower density and finite upper density \mu almost everywhere. Our condition involves integrals of certain many-point interaction functions (discrete curvatures) which measure flatness of simplices spanned by the parameters.
