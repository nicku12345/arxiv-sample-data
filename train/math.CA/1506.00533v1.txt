We obtain sufficient conditions ensuring the existence of a uniformly continuous and H\"older continuous homeomorphism between the solutions of a linear system of differential equations with piecewise constant argument of generalized type and the solutions of the quasilinear corresponding system. We use a definition (recently introduced by M. Akhmet) of exponential dichotomy for those systems combined with technical assumptions on the nonlinear part. Our result generalizes a previous work of G. Papaschinopoulos.
