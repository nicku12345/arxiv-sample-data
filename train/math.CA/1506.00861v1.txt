The so-called triangular Hilbert transform is an elegant trilinear singular integral form which specializes to many well studied objects of harmonic analysis. We investigate L^p bounds for a dyadic model of this form in the particular case when one of the functions on which it acts is essentially one-dimensional. This special case still implies dyadic analogues of boundedness of the Carleson maximal operator and of the uniform estimates for the one-dimensional bilinear Hilbert transform.
