We study the regularity of the roots of complex univariate polynomials whose coefficients depend smoothly on parameters. We show that any continuous choice of the roots of a C^{n-1,1}-curve of monic polynomials of degree n is locally absolutely continuous with locally p-integrable derivatives for every 1 \le p < n/(n-1), uniformly with respect to the coefficients. This result is optimal: in general, the derivatives of the roots of a smooth curve of monic polynomials of degree n are not locally n/(n-1)-integrable, and the roots may have locally unbounded variation if the coefficients are only of class C^{n-1,\alpha} for \alpha <1. We also prove a generalization of Ghisi and Gobbino's higher order Glaeser inequalities. We give three applications of the main results: local solvability of a system of pseudo-differential equations, a lifting theorem for mappings into orbit spaces of finite group representations, and a sufficient condition for multi-valued functions to be of Sobolev class W^{1,p} in the sense of Almgren.
