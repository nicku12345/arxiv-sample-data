Recently, Mursaleen et al applied (p,q)-calculus in approximation theory and introduced (p,q)-analogue of Bernstein operators in [16]. In this paper, we construct and introduce a generalization of the bivariate Bleimann-Butzer-Hahn operators based on (p,q)-integers and obtain Korovkin type approximation theorem of these operators. Furthermore, we compute the rate of convergence of the operators by using the modulus of continuity and Lipschitz type maximalfunctions.
