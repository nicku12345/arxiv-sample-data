In this paper, we obtain the general solution of the following functional equation f(3x + y + z) + f(x + 3y + z) + f(x + y + 3z) + f(x) + f(y) + f(z) = 6f(x + y + z): We establish the Hyers-Ulam-Rassias stability of the above functional equation in the fuzzy normed spaces. Further we show the above functional equation is stable in the sense of Hyers and Ulam in fuzzy normed spaces.
