In this paper, we introduce a Shurer type genaralization of (p,q)-Bernstein-Kantorovich operators based on (p,q)-integers and we call it as (p,q)-Bernstein-Schurer Kantorovich operators. We study approximation properties for these operators based on Korovkin's type approximation theorem and also study some direct theorems. Furthermore, we give comparisons and some illustrative graphics for the convergence of operators to some function.
