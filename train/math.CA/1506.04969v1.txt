We compute the exact John--Nirenberg constant of {\rm BMO}^p((0,1)) for 1\le p\le 2, which has been known only for p=1 and p=2. We also show that this constant is attained in the weak-type John--Nirenberg inequality and obtain a sharp lower estimate for the distance in {\rm BMO}^p to L^\infty. These results rely on sharp L^p- and weak-type estimates for logarithms of A_\infty weights, which in turn use the exact expressions for the corresponding Bellman functions.
