Let R be the vector of Riesz transforms on \mathbb{R}^n, and let \mu,\lambda \in A_p be two weights on \mathbb{R}^n, 1 < p < \infty. The two-weight norm inequality for the commutator [b, R] : L^p(\mathbb{R}^n;\mu) \to L^p(\mathbb{R}^n;\lambda) is shown to be equivalent to the function b being in a BMO space adapted to \mu and \lambda. This is a common extension of a result of Coifman-Rochberg-Weiss in the case of both \lambda and \mu being Lebesgue measure, and Bloom in the case of dimension one.
