We consider a generalized form of certain integral inequalities given by Guessab, Schmeisser and Alomari. The trapezoidal, mid point, Simpson, Newton-Simpson rules are obtained as special cases. Also, inequalities for the generalized Alomari functional in terms of the n-th order modulus, n=\overline{1,4}, are given and applied to some known quadrature rules.
