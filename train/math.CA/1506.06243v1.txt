The following problem is studied in this paper: Which multipliers \{\lambda_{k, n}\} ensure the convergence, as n\to \infty, of the linear means of the Fourier series of functions f\in L_1[-\pi, \pi]  \sum_{k=-\infty}^\infty \lambda_{k, n}\hat{f}_k e^{ikx},  where \widehat{f}_k is the k-th Fourier coefficient, at a point at which the derivative of the function \int_0^x f exists. A criterion for the convergence of the (C, 1)-means (\lambda_{k, n}=(1-\frac {|k|}{n+1})_+) is found, while in the general case \lambda_{k, n}=\phi(\frac {k}{n+1}) a sufficient condition is derived for the convergence at all such points (that is, almost everywhere). The answer is given in terms of the belonging of \phi(x) and x\phi'(x) to the Wiener algebra of absolutely convergent Fourier integrals. The obtained results are supplemented by some examples.
