In this paper, we discuss the representability almost everywhere (a.e.) in the plane of an irreducible algebraic function as the Cauchy transform of a signed measure supported on a finite number of compact semi-analytic curves and a finite number of isolated points. We discuss the existence of critical trajectories of a family of quadratic differentials.
