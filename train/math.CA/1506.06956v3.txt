Let K be the Calder\'on-Zygmund convolution kernel on \mathbb{R}^d (d\geq2). Define the commutator associated with K and a\in L^\infty(\mathbb{R}^d) by \[ T_af(x)=p.v. \int K(x-y)m_{x,y}a\cdot f(y)dy. \] Recently, Grafakos and Honz\'{\i}k [5] proved that T_a is of weak type (1,1) for d=2. In this paper, we show that T_a is also weighted weak type (1,1) with the weight |x|^\alpha\,(-2<\alpha <0) for d=2. Moreover, we prove that T_a is bounded on weighted L^p(\mathbb{R}^d)\,(1<p<\infty) for all d\ge2.
