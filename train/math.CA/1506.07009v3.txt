In the paper [G.Pantsulaia, On Uniformly Distributed Sequences on [-1/2,1/2], Georg. Inter. J. Sci. Tech.,4(3) (2013), 21--27], it was shown that \mu-almost every element of \mathbf{R}^{\infty} is uniformly distributed in [-\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{2}], where \mu denotes Yamasaki-Kharazishvili measure in \mathbf{R}^{\infty} for which \mu([-\frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{2}]^{\infty})=1. In the present paper the same set is studying from the point of view of shyness and it is demonstrated that it is shy in \mathbf{R}^{\infty}. In Solovay model, the set of all real valued sequences uniformly distributed module 1 in [-\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{2}] is studied from the point of view of shyness and it is shown that it is the prevalent set in \mathbf{R}^{\infty}.
