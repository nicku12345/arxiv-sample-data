In this paper, we deal with the complex Baskakov-Szasz-Durrmeyer mixed operators and study Voronovskaja type results with quantitative estimates for these operators attached to analytic functions of exponential growth in the open disk of radius R. Also, the exact order of approximation is found. The method used allows to construct complex Szasz-type and Baskakov-type approximation operators without involving the values on the positive real axis.
