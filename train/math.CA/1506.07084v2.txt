We prove that the complex Hermite polynomials H_{m,n} on the complex plane \mathbb{C} can be realized as the Fourier-Wigner transform \mathcal{V} of the well-known real Hermite functions h_n on real line \mathbb{R}. This reduces considerably the Wong's proof giving the explicit expression of \mathcal{V}(h_m,h_n) in terms of the Laguerre polynomials. Moreover, we derive a new generating function for the H_{m,n} as well as some new integral identities.
