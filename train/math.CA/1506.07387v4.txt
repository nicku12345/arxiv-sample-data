This article pertains to interpolation of Sobolev functions at shrinking lattices h\mathbb{Z}^d from L_p shift-invariant spaces associated with cardinal functions related to general multiquadrics, \phi_{\alpha,c}(x):=(|x|^2+c^2)^\alpha. The relation between the shift-invariant spaces generated by the cardinal functions and those generated by the multiquadrics themselves is considered. Additionally, L_p error estimates in terms of the dilation h are considered for the associated cardinal interpolation scheme. This analysis expands the range of \alpha values which were previously known to give such convergence rates (i.e. O(h^k) for functions with derivatives of order up to k in L_p, 1<p<\infty). Additionally, the analysis here demonstrates that some known best approximation rates for multiquadric approximation are obtained by their cardinal interpolants.
