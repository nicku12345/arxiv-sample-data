A subset E of a discrete abelian group is called \epsilon -Kronecker if all E-functions of modulus one can be approximated to within \epsilon by characters. E is called a Sidon set if all bounded E-functions can be interpolated by the Fourier transform of measures on the dual group. As \epsilon-Kronecker sets with \epsilon <2 possess the same arithmetic properties as Sidon sets, it is natural to ask if they are Sidon. We use the Pisier net characterization of Sidonicity to prove this is true.
