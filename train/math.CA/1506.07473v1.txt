Given a joint probability density function of N real random variables, \{x_j\}_{j=1}^{N}, obtained from the eigenvector-eigenvalue decomposition of N\times N random matrices, one constructs a random variable, the linear statistics, defined by the sum of smooth functions evaluated at the eigenvalues or singular values of the random matrix, namely, \sum_{j=1}^{N}F(x_j). For the jpdfs obtained from the Gaussian and Laguerre ensembles, we compute, in this paper the moment generating function \mathbb{E}_{\beta}({\rm exp}(-\lambda\sum_{j}F(x_j))), where \mathbb{E}_{\beta} denotes expectation value over the Orthogonal (\beta=1) and Symplectic (\beta=4) ensembles, in the form one plus a Schwartz function, none vanishing over \mathbb{R} for the Gaussian ensembles and \mathbb{R}^+ for the Laguerre ensembles. These are ultimately expressed in the form of the determinants of identity plus a scalar operator, from which we obtained the large N asymptotic of the linear statistics from suitably scaled F(\cdot).
