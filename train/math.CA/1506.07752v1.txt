Let T be a multilinear integral operator which is bounded on certain products of Lebesgue spaces on \mathbb R^n. We assume that its associated kernel satisfies some mild regularity condition which is weaker than the usual H\"older continuity of those in the class of multilinear Calder\'on-Zygmund singular integral operators. In this paper, given a suitable multiple weight \vec{w}, we obtain the bound for the weighted norm of multilinear operators T in terms of \vec{w}. As applications, we exploit this result to obtain the weighted bounds for certain singular integral operators such as linear and multilinear Fourier multipliers and the Riesz transforms associated to Schr\"odinger operators on \mathbb{R}^n. Our results are new even in the linear case.
