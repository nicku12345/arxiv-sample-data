The notion of the Jacob's ladders, reversely iterated integrals and the \zeta-factorization is used in this paper in order to obtain new results in study of the function \arg\zf. Namely, we obtain new formulae for non-local and non-linear interaction of the functions |\zf| and \arg\zf, and also a set of metamorphoses of the oscillating Q-system.
