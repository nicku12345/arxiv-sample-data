In this paper, we obtain some boundedness of the following general multilinear square functions T with non-smooth kernels, which extend some known results significantly.  T(\vec{f})(x)=\big( \int_{0}^\infty \big|\int_{(\mathbb{R}^n)^m}K_v(x,y_1,\dots,y_m) \prod_{j=1}^mf_{j}(y_j)dy_1,\dots,dy_m\big|^2\frac{dv}{v}\big)^{\frac 12}.  The corresponding multilinear maximal square function T^* was also introduced and weighted strong and weak type estimates for T^* were given.
