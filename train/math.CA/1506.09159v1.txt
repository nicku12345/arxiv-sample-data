This paper is inspired by the work of J. S\'{a}ndor in 2006. In the paper, the authors establish some double inequalities involving the ratio  \frac{\Gamma_{q}(x+1)}{ \Gamma_{q} \left( x+\frac{1}{2}\right)}, where \Gamma_{q}(x) is the q-deformation of the classical Gamma function denoted by \Gamma(x). The method employed in presenting the results makes use of Jackson's q-integral representation of the q-deformed Gamma function. In addition, H\"{o}lder's inequality for the q-integral, as well as some basic analytical techniques involving the q-analogue of the psi function are used. As a consequence, q-analogues of the classical Wendel's asymptotic relation are obtained. At the end, sharpness of the inequalities established in this paper is investigated.
