In this paper we study the Dini functions and the cross-product of Bessel functions. Moreover, we are interested on the monotonicity patterns for the cross-product of Bessel and modified Bessel functions. In addition, we deduce Redheffer-type inequalities, and the interlacing property of the zeros of Dini functions and the cross-product of Bessel and modified Bessel functions. Bounds for logarithmic derivatives of these functions are also derived. The key tools in our proofs are some recently developed infinite product representations for Dini functions and cross-product of Bessel functions.
