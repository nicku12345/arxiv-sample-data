In this paper we consider the polynomial sequence (P_{n}^{\alpha,q}(x)) that is orthogonal on [-1,1] with respect to the weight function x^{2q+1}(1-x^{2})^{\alpha}(1-x), \alpha>-1, q\in \mathbb N; we obtain the coefficients of the tree-term recurrence relation (TTRR) by using a different method from the one derived in \cite{kn:atia1}; we prove that the interlacing property does not hold properly for (P_n^{\alpha,q}(x)); and we also prove that, if x_{n,n}^{\alpha+i,q+j} is the largest zero of P_{n}^{\alpha+i,q+j}(x), \displaystyle x_{2n-2j,2n-2j}^{\alpha+j,q+j}< x_{2n-2i,2n-2i}^{\alpha+i,q+i}, 0\leq i<j\leq n-1.
