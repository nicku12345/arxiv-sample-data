The aim of this paper is to apply an original computation method due to Malesevic and Makragic [5] to the problem of approximating some trigonometric functions. Inequalities of Wilker-Cusa-Huygens are discussed, but the method can be successfully applied to a wide class of problems. In particular, we improve the estimates recently obtained by Mortici [1] and moreover we show that they hold true also on some extended intervals.
