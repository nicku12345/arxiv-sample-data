In this note we formulate a sufficient condition for the quasiconvexity at x \mapsto \lambda x of certain functionals I(u) which model the stored-energy of elastic materials subject to a deformation u. The materials we consider may cavitate, and so we impose the well-known technical condition (INV), due to M\"{u}ller and Spector, on admissible deformations. Deformations obey the condition u(x)= \lambda x whenever x belongs to the boundary of the domain initially occupied by the material. In terms of the parameters of the models, our analysis provides an explicit upper bound on those \lambda>0 such that I(u) \geq I(u_{\lambda}) for all admissible u, where u_{\lambda} is the linear map x \mapsto \lambda x applied across the entire domain. This is the quasiconvexity condition referred to above.
