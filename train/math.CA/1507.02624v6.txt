In this article, we prove that a cone is a Heisenberg uniqueness pair corresponding to sphere as long as the cone does not completely recline on the level surface of any homogeneous harmonic polynomial on \mathbb R^n. We derive that \left(S^2, \text{ paraboloid}\right) and \left(S^2, \text{ geodesic of } S_r(o)\right) are Heisenberg uniqueness pairs for a class of certain symmetric finite Borel measures in \mathbb R^3. Further, we correlate the problem of Heisenberg uniqueness pairs to the sets of injectivity for the spherical mean operator.
