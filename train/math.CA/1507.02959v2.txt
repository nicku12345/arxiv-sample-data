We use tools from q-calculus to study LDL^T decomposition of the Vandermonde matrix V_q with coefficients v_{i,j}=q^{ij}. We prove that the matrix L is given as a product of diagonal matrices and the lower triangular Toeplitz matrix T_q with coefficients t_{i,j}=1/(q;q)_{i-j}, where (z;q)_k is the q-Pochhammer symbol. We investigate some properties of the matrix T_q, in particular, we compute explicitly the inverse of this matrix.
