We present the proof of a certain modified version of Kolmogorov's strong law of large numbers for calculation of Lebesgue Integrals by using uniformly distributed sequences in (0,1). We extend the result of C. Baxa and J. Schoi\betaengeier (cf.\cite{BaxSch2002}, Theorem 1, p. 271) to a maximal set of uniformly distributed (in (0,1)) sequences S_f \subset(0,1)^{\infty} which strictly contains the set of sequences of the form (\{\alpha n\})_{n \in {\bf N}} with irrational number \alpha and for which \ell_1^{\infty}(S_f)=1, where \ell_1^{\infty} denotes the infinite power of the linear Lebesgue measure \ell_1 in (0,1).
