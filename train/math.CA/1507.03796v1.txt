We show that multipliers of second order Riesz transforms on products of discrete abelian groups enjoy the L^{p}  estimate p^{\ast} -1, where p^{\ast} = \max \{ p,q \} and p and q are conjugate exponents. This estimate is sharp if one considers all multipliers of the form \sum_i \sigma_{i} R_{i} R^{\ast}_{i} with | \sigma_{i} | \leqslant 1 and infinite groups. In the real valued case, we obtain better sharp estimates for some specific multipliers, such as \sum_{i} \sigma_{i} R_{i} R^{\ast}_{i} with 0 \leqslant \sigma_{i} \leqslant 1. These are the first known precise L^{p}  estimates for discrete Calder\'on-Zygmund operators.
