The paper continues the intriguing theme that many key facts of (single-variable) Real Analysis are not only crucially dependent on the completeness of the real numbers, but are actually equivalent to it. The list of these characterizations of completeness is long and contains many prominent items, but so far the "biggest price", the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus (FTC), had resisted inclusion in the list. We show that the FTC can be included, if one considers uniformly differentiable anti-derivatives. In the process, we exhibit some interesting facts about uniformly differentiable functions, including an additional characterization of completeness. We also discuss the second part of the FTC, the "Evaluation Theorem".
