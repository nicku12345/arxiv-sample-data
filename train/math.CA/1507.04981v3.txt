By application of the theory for second-order linear differential equations with two turning points developed in \cite{Olver1975}, uniform asymptotic approximations are obtained for the Lam\'{e} and Mathieu functions with a large real parameter. The approximations are expressed in terms of parabolic cylinder functions, and are uniformly valid in their respective real open intervals. In all cases explicit bounds are supplied for the error terms associated with the approximations. Approximations are also obtained for their respective eigenvalues.
