We continue with the study of the Hankel determinant,  D_{n}(t,\alpha,\beta):=\det\left(\int_{0}^{1}x^{j+k}w(x;t,\alpha,\beta)dx\right)_{j,k=0}^{n-1},  generated by a Pollaczek-Jacobi type weight,  w(x;t,\alpha,\beta):=x^{\alpha}(1-x)^{\beta}{\rm e}^{-t/x}, \quad x\in [0,1], \quad \alpha>0, \quad \beta>0, \quad t\geq 0.  This reduces to the "pure" Jacobi weight at t=0. We may take \alpha\in \mathbb{R}, in the situation while t is strictly greater than 0. It was shown in Chen and Dai (2010), that the logarithmic derivative of this Hankel determinant satisfies a Jimbo-Miwa-Okamoto \sigma-form of Painlev\'e \uppercase\expandafter{\romannumeral5} ({\rm P_{\uppercase\expandafter{\romannumeral5}}}). In fact the logarithmic of the Hankel determinant has an integral representation in terms of a particular {\rm P_{\uppercase\expandafter{\romannumeral5}}}. \\ In this paper, we show that, under a double scaling, where n the dimension of the Hankel matrix tends to \infty, and t tends to 0^{+}, such that s:=2n^2t is finite, the double scaled Hankel determinant (effectively an operator determinant) has an integral representation in terms of a particular {\rm P_{\uppercase\expandafter{\romannumeral3}'}}. Expansions of the scaled Hankel determinant for small and large s are found. A further double scaling with \alpha=-2n+\lambda, where n\rightarrow \infty and t, tends to 0^{+}, such that s:=nt is finite. In this situation the scaled Hankel determinant has an integral representation in terms of a particular {\rm P_{\uppercase\expandafter{\romannumeral5}}}, %which can be degenerate to a particular {\rm P_{\uppercase\expandafter{\romannumeral3}}} and its small and large s asymptotic expansions are also found.
