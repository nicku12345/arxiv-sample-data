Motivated by the well-known implications among t-convexity properties of real functions, analogous relations among the upper and lower M-convexity properties of real functions are established. More precisely, having an n-tuple (M_1,\dots,M_n) of continuous two-variable means, the notion of the descendant of these means (which is also an n-tuple (N_1,\dots,N_n) of two-variable means) is introduced. In particular, when all the means M_i are weighted arithmetic, then the components of their descendants are also weighted arithmetic means. More general statements are obtained in terms of the generalized quasi-arithmetic or Matkowski means. The main results then state that if a function f is M_i-convex for all i\in\{1,\dots,n\}, then it is also N_i-convex for all i\in\{1,\dots,n\}. Several consequences are discussed.
