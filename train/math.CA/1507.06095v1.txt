We study the existence of positive solutions on the half-line [0,\infty) for the nonlinear second order differential equation \[ \bigl(a(t)x^{\prime}\bigr)^{\prime}+b(t)F(x)=0,\quad t\geq0, \] satisfying Dirichlet type conditions, say x(0)=0, \lim_{t\rightarrow\infty}x(t)=0. The function b is allowed to change sign and the nonlinearity F is assumed to be asymptotically linear in a neighborhood of zero and infinity. Our results cover also the cases in which b is a periodic function for large t or it is unbounded from below.
