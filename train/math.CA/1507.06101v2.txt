To a 2\times2 matrix G with complex entries, we relate the sequence of Laurent polynomial L_n(z,G)=\tr \big(G\big[\begin{smallmatrix}z&0\\ 0&z^{-1}\end{smallmatrix}\big]G^{\ast}\big)^n. It turns out that for each \(n\), the family \big\{L_n(z,G)\big\}_G, where G runs over the set of all 2\times2 matrices, is a three-parametric family. A natural parametrization of this family is found. The polynomial L_n(z,G) is expressed in terms of these parameters and the Chebyshev polynomial T_n. The zero set of the polynomial L_n(z,G) is described.
