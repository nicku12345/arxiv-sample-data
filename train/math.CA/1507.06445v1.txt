We study the two-parameter family of unitary operators \[ \mathcal{F}_{k,a}=\exp\Bigl(\frac{i\pi}{2a}\,(2\langle k\rangle+{d}+a-2 )\Bigr) \exp\Bigl(\frac{i\pi}{2a}\,\Delta_{k,a}\Bigr), \] which are called (k,a)-generalized Fourier transforms and defined by the a-deformed Dunkl harmonic oscillator \Delta_{k,a}=|x|^{2-a}\Delta_{k}-|x|^{a}, a>0, where \Delta_{k} is the Dunkl Laplacian. Particular cases of such operators are the Fourier and Dunkl transforms. The restriction of \mathcal{F}_{k,a} to radial functions is given by the a-deformed Hankel transform H_{\lambda,a}.   We obtain necessary and sufficient conditions for the weighted (L^{p},L^{q}) Pitt inequalities to hold for the a-deformed Hankel transform. Moreover, we prove two-sided Boas--Sagher type estimates for the general monotone functions. We also prove sharp Pitt's inequality for \mathcal{F}_{k,a} transform in L^{2}(\mathbb{R}^{d}) with the corresponding weights. Finally, we establish the logarithmic uncertainty principle for \mathcal{F}_{k,a}.
