In this paper, using the remarkable orthonormal wavelet basis constructed recently by Auscher and Hyt\"onen, we establish the theory of product Hardy spaces on spaces {\widetilde X} = X_1\times X_2\times\cdot \cdot\cdot\times X_n, where each factor X_i is a space of homogeneous type in the sense of Coifman and Weiss. The main tool we develop is the Littlewood--Paley theory on \widetilde X, which in turn is a consequence of a corresponding theory on each factor space. We define the square function for this theory in terms of the wavelet coefficients. The Hardy space theory developed in this paper includes product~H^p, the dual \cmo^p of H^p with the special case \bmo = \cmo^1, and the predual \vmo of H^1. We also use the wavelet expansion to establish the Calder\'on--Zygmund decomposition for product H^p, and deduce an interpolation theorem. We make no additional assumptions on the quasi-metric or the doubling measure for each factor space, and thus we extend to the full generality of product spaces of homogeneous type the aspects of both one-parameter and multiparameter theory involving the Littlewood--Paley theory and function spaces. Moreover, our methods would be expected to be a powerful tool for developing wavelet analysis on spaces of homogeneous type.
