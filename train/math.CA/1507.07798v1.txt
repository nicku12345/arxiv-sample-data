The purpose of this short paper is to show the invalidity of a Fourier series expansion of fractional order as derived by G. Jumarie in a series of papers. In his work the exponential functions e^{in\omega x} are replaced by the Mittag-Leffler functions E_\alpha \left (i (n\omega x)^\alpha\right) , over the interval [0, M_\alpha/ \omega] where 0< \omega<\infty  and M_\alpha is the period of the function E_\alpha \left( ix^\alpha\right), i.e., E_\alpha \left( ix^\alpha\right)=E_\alpha \left( i(x+M_\alpha)^\alpha\right).
