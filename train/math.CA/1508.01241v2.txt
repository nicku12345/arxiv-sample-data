We study a natural nonlinear analogue of Fourier series. Iterative Blaschke factorization allows one to formally write any holomorphic function F as a series which successively unravels or unwinds the oscillation of the function  F = a_1 B_1 + a_2 B_1 B_2 + a_3 B_1 B_2 B_3 + \dots where a_i \in \mathbb{C} and B_i is a Blaschke product. Numerical experiments point towards rapid convergence of the formal series but the actual mechanism by which this is happening has yet to be explained. We derive a family of inequalities and use them to prove convergence for a large number of function spaces: for example, we have convergence in L^2 for functions in the Dirichlet space \mathcal{D}. Furthermore, we present a numerically efficient way to expand a function without explicit calculations of the Blaschke zeroes going back to Guido and Mary Weiss.
