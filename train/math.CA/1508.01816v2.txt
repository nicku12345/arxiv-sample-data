We prove a generalization of the Kibble--Slepian formula (for Hermite polynomials) and its unitary analogue involving the 2D Hermite polynomials recently proved in \cite{Ism4}. We derive integral representations for the 2D Hermite polynomials which are of independent interest. Several new generating functions for 2D q-Hermite polynomials will also be given.
