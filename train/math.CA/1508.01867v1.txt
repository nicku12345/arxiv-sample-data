We study the periodic boundary value problem associated with the second order nonlinear differential equation  u" + c u' + \left(a^{+}(t) - \mu \, a^{-}(t)\right) g(u) = 0,  where g(u) has superlinear growth at zero and at infinity, a(t) is a periodic sign-changing weight, c\in\mathbb{R} and \mu>0 is a real parameter. We prove the existence of 2^{m}-1 positive solutions when a(t) has m positive humps separated by m negative ones (in a periodicity interval) and \mu is sufficiently large. The proof is based on the extension of Mawhin's coincidence degree defined in open (possibly unbounded) sets and applies also to Neumann boundary conditions. Our method also provides a topological approach to detect subharmonic solutions.
