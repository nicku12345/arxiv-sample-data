We consider differences between \log \Gamma(x) and truncations of certain classical asymptotic expansions in inverse powers of x-\lambda whose coefficients are expressed in terms of Bernoulli polynomials B_n(\lambda), and we obtain conditions under which these differences are strictly completely monotonic. In the symmetric cases \lambda=0 and \lambda=1/2, we recover results of Sonin, N\"orlund and Alzer. Also we show how to derive these asymptotic expansions using the functional equation of the logarithmic derivative of the Euler gamma function, the representation of 1/x as a difference F(x+1)-F(x), and a backward induction.
