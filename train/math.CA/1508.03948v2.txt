The Stieltjes constants \gamma_n appear in the coefficients in the Laurent expansion of the Riemann zeta function \zeta(s) about the simple pole s=1. We present an asymptotic expansion for \gamma_n as n\rightarrow \infty based on the approach described by Knessel and Coffey [Math. Comput. {\bf 80} (2011) 379--386]. A truncated form of this expansion with explicit coefficients is also given. Numerical results are presented that illustrate the accuracy achievable with our expansion.
