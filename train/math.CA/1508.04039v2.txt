We prove the \emph{sum of squared logarithms inequality} (SSLI) which states that for nonnegative vectors x, y \in \mathbb{R}^n whose elementary symmetric polynomials satisfy e_k(x)\le e_k(y) (for 1\le k < n) and e_n(x)=e_n(y), the inequality \sum_i (\log x_i)^2 \le \sum_i (\log y_i)^2 holds. Our proof of this inequality follows by a suitable extension to the complex plane. In particular, we show that the function f\colon M\subseteq \mathbb{C}^n\to \mathbb{R} with f(z)=\sum_i(\log z_i)^2 has nonnegative partial derivatives with respect to the elementary symmetric polynomials of z. This property leads to our proof. We conclude by providing applications and wider connections of the SSLI.
