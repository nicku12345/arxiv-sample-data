We consider Fourier multipliers in \mathbb{R}^2 of the form m\circ\rho where \rho is the Minkowski functional associated to a convex set in \mathbb{R}^2, and prove L^p bounds for the corresponding multiplier operators. It is of interest to consider domains whose boundary is not smooth. Our results depend on a notion of Minkowski dimension introduced by Seeger and Ziesler that measures "flatness" of the boundary of the domain. Our methods analyze the case of oscillatory multipliers \frac{e^{i\rho(\xi)}}{(1+|\xi|)^{-a}} associated to wave equations, which we use to derive results for more general multiplier transformations.
