In the present paper, we consider Stancu type generalization of Baskakov-Sz\'{a}sz operators based on the q-integers and obtain statistical and weighted statistical approximation properties of these operators. Rates of statistical convergence by means of the modulus of continuity and the Lipschitz type maximal function are also established for operators.
