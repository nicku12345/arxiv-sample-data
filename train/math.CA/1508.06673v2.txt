We consider the class C(T) of continuous real-valued functions on the circle. For certain classes of functions naturally characterised by the rapidity of decrease of Fourier coefficients we investigate whether it is possible to bring families of functions in C(T) into these classes by a change of variable.

The English translation, published in Mathematics of the USSR, Sbornik, 70:2 (1991), 541--555, is to a large extent inconsistent with the original text.
