The classical example of no-where differentiable but everywhere continuous function is Weierstrass function. In this paper we define the fractional order Weierstrass function in terms of Jumarie fractional trigonometric functions. The Holder exponent and Box dimension of this function are calculated here. It is established that the Holder exponent and Box dimension of this fractional order Weierstrass function are the same as in the original Weierstrass function, independent of incorporating the fractional trigonometric function. This is new development in generalizing the classical Weierstrass function by usage of fractional trigonometric function and obtain its character and also of fractional derivative of fractional Weierstrass function by Jumarie fractional derivative, and establishing that roughness index are invariant to this generalization.
