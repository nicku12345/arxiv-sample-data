The well-known Bohr--P\'al theorem asserts that for every continuous real-valued function f on the circle \mathbb T there exists a change of variable, i.e., a homeomorphism h of \mathbb T onto itself, such that the Fourier series of the superposition f\circ h converges uniformly. Subsequent improvements of this result imply that actually there exists a homeomorphism that brings f into the Sobolev space W_2^{1/2}(\mathbb T). This refined version of the Bohr--P\'al theorem does not extend to complex-valued functions. We show that if \alpha<1/2, then there exists a complex-valued f that satisfies the Lipschitz condition of order \alpha and at the same time has the property that f\circ h\notin W_2^{1/2}(\mathbb T) for every homeomorphism h of \mathbb T.
