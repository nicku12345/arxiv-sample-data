In January-March 2011, the Department of Mathematical Science at the University of Cincinnati held a Taft Research Seminar "Bellman function method in harmonic analysis." The seminar was made possible by a generous grant from the Taft Foundation. The principal speaker at the seminar was Vasily Vasyunin. The local host and convener of the seminar was Leonid Slavin.   The seminar was in effect a 10-week lecture- and discussion-based course. This manuscript represents a slightly revised content of those lectures. In particular, it includes some technical details that were omitted in class due to time constraints.
