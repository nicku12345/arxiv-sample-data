Fix \lambda>0. Consider the Hardy space H^1(\mathbb{R}_+,dm_\lambda) in the sense of Coifman and Weiss, where \mathbb{R_+}:=(0,\infty) and dm_\lambda:=x^{2\lambda}dx with dx the Lebesgue measure. Also consider the Bessel operators \Delta_\lambda:=-\frac{d^2}{dx^2}-\frac{2\lambda}{x} \frac d{dx}, and S_\lambda:=-\frac{d^2}{dx^2}+\frac{\lambda^2-\lambda}{x^2} on \mathbb{R_+}. The Hardy spaces H^1_{\Delta_\lambda} and H^1_{S_\lambda} associated with \Delta_\lambda and S_\lambda are defined via the Riesz transforms R_{\Delta_\lambda}:=\partial_x (\Delta_\lambda)^{-1/2} and R_{S_\lambda}:= x^\lambda\partial_x x^{-\lambda} (S_\lambda)^{-1/2}, respectively. It is known that H^1_{\Delta_\lambda} and H^1(\mathbb{R}_+,dm_\lambda) coincide but they are different from H^1_{S_\lambda}. In this article, we prove the following: (a) a weak factorization of H^1(\mathbb{R}_+,dm_\lambda) by using a bilinear form of the Riesz transform R_{\Delta_\lambda}, which implies the characterization of the BMO space associated to \Delta_\lambda via the commutators related to R_{\Delta_\lambda}; (b) the BMO space associated to S_\lambda can not be characterized by commutators related to R_{S_\lambda}, which implies that H^1_{S_\lambda} does not have a weak factorization via a bilinear form of the Riesz transform R_{S_\lambda}.
