We prove sharp weak and strong type weighted estimates for a class of dyadic operators that includes majorants of both standard singular integrals and square functions. Our main new result is the optimal bound [w]_{A_p}^{1/p}[w]_{A_\infty}^{1/2-1/p}\lesssim [w]_{A_p}^{1/2} for the weak type norm of square functions on L^p(w) for p>2; previously, such a bound was only known with a logarithmic correction. By the same approach, we also recover several related results in a streamlined manner.
