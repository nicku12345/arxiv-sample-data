We study the regularity of convolution powers for measures supported on Salem sets, and prove related results on Fourier restriction and Fourier multipliers. In particular we show that for \alpha of the form {d}/{n}, n=2,3,\cdots there exist \alpha-Salem measures for which the L^2 Fourier restriction theorem holds in the range p\le \frac{2d}{2d-\alpha}.   The results rely on ideas of K\"orner. We extend some of his constructions to obtain upper regular \alpha-Salem measures, with sharp regularity results for n-fold convolutions for all n\in \mathbb N.
