We introduce the power collection method for easily deriving connection relations for certain hypergeometric orthogonal polynomials in the (q-)Askey scheme. We summarize the full-extent to which the power collection method may be used. As an example, we use the power collection method to derive connection and connection-type relations for Meixner and Krawtchouk polynomials. These relations are then used to derive generalizations of generating functions for these orthogonal polynomials. The coefficients of these generalized generating functions are in general, given in term of multiple hypergeometric functions. From derived generalized generating functions, we derive corresponding contour integral and infinite series expressions by using orthogonality.
