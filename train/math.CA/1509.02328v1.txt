In this paper, we construct generalized Baskakov Kantorovich operators. We establish some direct results and then study weighted approximation, simultaneous approximation and statistical convergence properties for these operators. Finally, we obtain the rate of convergence for functions having a derivative coinciding almost everywhere with a function of bounded variation for these operators
