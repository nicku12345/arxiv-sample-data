Given a Calder\'on-Zygmund operator T, a classic result of Coifman-Rochberg-Weiss relates the norm of the commutator [b, T] with the BMO norm of b. We focus on a weighted version of this result, obtained by Bloom and later generalized by Lacey and the authors, which relates \| [b, T] : L^p(\mathbb{R}^n; \mu) \to L^p(\mathbb{R}^n; \lambda) \| to the norm of b in a certain weighted BMO space determined by A_p weights \mu and \lambda. We extend this result to higher iterates of the commutator and recover a one-weight result of Chung-Pereyra-Perez in the process.
