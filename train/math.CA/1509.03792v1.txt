This paper considers filtered polynomial approximations on the unit sphere \mathbb{S}^d\subset \mathbb{R}^{d+1}, obtained by truncating smoothly the Fourier series of an integrable function f with the help of a "filter" h, which is a real-valued continuous function on [0,\infty) such that h(t)=1 for t\in[0,1] and h(t)=0 for t\ge2. The resulting "filtered polynomial approximation" (a spherical polynomial of degree 2L-1) is then made fully discrete by approximating the inner product integrals by an N-point cubature rule of suitably high polynomial degree of precision, giving an approximation called "filtered hyperinterpolation". In this paper we require that the filter h and all its derivatives up to \lfloor\tfrac{d-1}{2}\rfloor are absolutely continuous, while its right and left derivatives of order \lfloor \tfrac{d+1}{2}\rfloor exist everywhere and are of bounded variation. Under this assumption we show that for a function f in the Sobolev space W^s_p(\mathbb{S}^d),\ 1\le p\le \infty, both approximations are of the optimal order  L^{-s}, in the first case for s>0 and in the second fully discrete case for s>d/p.
