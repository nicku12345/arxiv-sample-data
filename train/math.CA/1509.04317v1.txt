The aim of this article is to introduce the Kantorovich form of generalized Szasz-type operators involving Charlier polynomials with certain parameters. In this paper we discussed the rate of convergence better error estimates and Korovkin-type theorem in polynomial weighted space. Further, we investigate the local approximation results with the help of Ditzian-Totik modulus of smoothness second order modulus of continuity Peetre's K functional and Lipschitz class.
