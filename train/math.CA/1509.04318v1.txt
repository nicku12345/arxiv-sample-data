Cyber-physical systems (CPSs) are man-made complex systems coupled with natural processes that, as a whole, should be described by distributed parameter systems (DPSs) in general forms. This paper presents three such general models for generalized DPSs that can be used to characterize complex CPSs. These three different types of fractional operators based DPS models are: fractional Laplacian operator, fractional power of operator or fractional derivative. This research investigation is motivated by many fractional order models describing natural, physical, and anomalous phenomena, such as sub-diffusion process or super-diffusion process. The relationships among these three different operators are explored and explained. Several potential future research opportunities are then articulated followed by some conclusions and remarks.
