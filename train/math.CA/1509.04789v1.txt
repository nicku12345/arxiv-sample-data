We propose a criterion for the existence of monotone wavefronts in non-monotone and non-local monostable diffusive equations of the Mackey-Glass type. This extends recent results by Gomez et al proved for the particular case of equations with local delayed reaction. In addition, we demonstrate the uniqueness (up to a translation) of obtained monotone wavefront within the class of all monotone wavefronts (such a kind of conditional uniqueness was recently established for the non-local KPP-Fisher equation by Fang and Zhao). Moreover, we show that if delayed reaction is local then this uniqueness actually holds within the class of all wavefronts and therefore the minimal fronts under consideration (either pulled or pushed) should be monotone. Similarly to the case of the KPP-Fisher equations, our approach is based on the construction of an appropriate fundamental solution for associated boundary value problem for linear integral-differential equation.
