Suppose \mu is an \alpha-dimensional fractal measure for some 0<\alpha<n. Inspired by the results proved by R. Strichartz in 1990, we discuss the L^p-asymptotics of the Fourier transform of fd\mu by estimating bounds of   \underset{L\rightarrow\infty}{\liminf}\ \frac{1}{L^k} \int_{|\xi|\leq L}\ |\widehat{fd\mu}(\xi)|^pd\xi, for f\in L^p(d\mu) and 2<p<2n/\alpha. In a different direction, we prove a Hardy type inequality, that is,   \int\frac{|f(x)|^p}{(\mu(E_x))^{2-p}}d\mu(x)\leq C\ \underset{L\rightarrow\infty}{\liminf} \frac{1}{L^{n-\alpha}} \int_{B_L(0)} |\widehat{fd\mu}(\xi)|^pd\xi where 1\leq p\leq 2 and E_x=E\cap(-\infty,x_1]\times(-\infty,x_2]...(-\infty,x_n] for x=(x_1,...x_n)\in\R^n generalizing the one dimensional results proved by Hudson and Leckband in 1992.
