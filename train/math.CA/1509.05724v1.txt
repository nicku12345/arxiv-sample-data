This paper contains new results on two classical topics in fractal geometry: projections, and intersections with affine planes. To keep the notation of the abstract simple, we restrict the discussion to the planar cases of our theorems.   Our first main result considers the orthogonal projections of two Borel sets A,B \subset \mathbb{R}^{2} into one-dimensional subspaces. Under the assumptions \dim A \leq 1 < \dim B and \dim A + \dim B > 2, we prove that the intersection of the projections P_{L}(A) and P_{L}(B) has dimension at least \dim A - \epsilon for positively many lines L, and for any \epsilon > 0. This is quite sharp: given s,t \in [0,2] with s + t = 2, we construct compact sets A,B \subset \mathbb{R}^{2} with \dim A = s and \dim B = t such that almost all intersections P_{L}(A) \cap P_{L}(B) are empty. In case both \dim A > 1 and \dim B > 1, we prove that the intersections P_{L}(A) \cap P_{L}(B) have positive length for positively many L.   If A \subset \mathbb{R}^{2} is a Borel set with 0 < \mathcal{H}^{s}(A) < \infty for some s > 1, it is known that A is 'visible' from almost all points x \in \mathbb{R}^{2} in the sense that A intersects a positive fraction of all lines passing through x. In fact, a result of Marstrand says that such non-empty intersections typically have dimension s - 1. Our second main result strengthens this by showing that the set of exceptional points x \in \mathbb{R}^{2}, for which Marstrand's assertion fails, has Hausdorff dimension at most one.
