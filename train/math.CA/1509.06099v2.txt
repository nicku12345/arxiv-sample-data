We study the rough bilinear singular integral, introduced by Coifman and Meyer ,  T_\Omega(f,g)(x)=p.v. \! \int_{\mathbb R^{n}}\! \int_{\mathbb R^{n}}\! |(y,z)|^{-2n} \Omega((y,z)/|(y,z)|)f(x-y)g(x-z) dydz,  when \Omega  is a function in L^q(\mathbb S^{2n-1}) with vanishing integral and 2\le q\le \infty. When q=\infty we obtain boundedness for T_\Omega from L^{p_1}(\mathbb R^n)\times L^{p_2}(\mathbb R^n) to  L^p(\mathbb R^n)  when 1<p_1, p_2<\infty and 1/p=1/p_1+1/p_2. For q=2 we obtain that T_\Omega is bounded from L^{2}(\mathbb R^n)\times L^{ 2}(\mathbb R^n) to  L^1(\mathbb R^n) . For q between 2 and infinity we obtain the analogous boundedness on a set of indices around the point (1/2,1/2,1). To obtain our results we introduce a new bilinear technique based on tensor-type wavelet decompositions.
