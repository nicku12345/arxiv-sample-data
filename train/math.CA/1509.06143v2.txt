A matrix-valued measure \Theta reduces to measures of smaller size if there exists a constant invertible matrix M such that M\Theta M^* is block diagonal. Equivalently, the real vector space {\mathscr A} of all matrices T such that T\Theta(X)=\Theta(X) T^* for any Borel set X is non-trivial. If the subspace A_h of self-adjoints elements in the commutant algebra A of \Theta is non-trivial, then \Theta is reducible via a unitary matrix. In this paper we prove that {\mathscr A} is *-invariant if and only if A_h={\mathscr A}, i.e., every reduction of \Theta can be performed via a unitary matrix. The motivation for this paper comes from families of matrix-valued polynomials related to the group {\rm SU}(2)\times {\rm SU}(2) and its quantum analogue. In both cases the commutant algebra A=A_h\oplus iA_h is of dimension two and the matrix-valued measures reduce unitarily into a 2\times 2 block diagonal matrix. Here we show that there is no further non-unitary reduction.
