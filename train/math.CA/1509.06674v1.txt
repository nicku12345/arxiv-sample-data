In this paper we prove a sharp trilinear inequality which is motivated by a program to obtain the sharp form of the L^2 - L^6 Tomas-Stein adjoint restriction inequality on the circle. Our method uses intricate estimates for integrals of sixfold products of Bessel functions developed in a companion paper. We also establish that constants are local extremizers of the Tomas-Stein adjoint restriction inequality as well as of another inequality appearing in the program.
