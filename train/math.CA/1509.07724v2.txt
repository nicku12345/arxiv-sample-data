A new notion of dual fusion frame has been recently introduced by the authors. In this article that notion is further motivated and it is shown that it is suitable to deal with questions posed in a finite-dimensional real or complex Hilbert space, reinforcing the idea that this concept of duality solves the question about an appropriate definition of dual fusion frames. It is shown that for overcomplete fusion frames there always exist duals different from the canonical one. Conditions that assure the uniqueness of duals are given. The relation of dual fusion frame systems with dual frames and dual projective reconstruction systems is established. Optimal dual fusion frames for the reconstruction in case of erasures of subspaces, and optimal dual fusion frame systems for the reconstruction in case of erasures of local frame vectors are determined. Examples that illustrate the obtained results are exhibited.
