For any 3-monotone on [a,b] function f (its third divided differences are nonnegative for all choices of four distinct points, or equivalently, f has a convex derivative on (a,b)) we construct a cubic 3-monotone (like f) spline s with n\in \Bbb N "almost" equidistant knots a_j such that  \left\Vert f-s \right\Vert_{[a_j,a_{j-1}]} \le c\, \omega_4 \left(f,(b-a)/n,[a_{j+4},a_{j-5}]\cap [a,b]\right), \quad j=1,...,n,  where c is an absolute constant, \omega_4 \left(f,t,[\cdot,\cdot]\right) is the 4-th modulus of smoothness of f, and ||\cdot ||_{[\cdot,\cdot]} is the max-norm.
