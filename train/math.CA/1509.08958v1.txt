We study the necessity of bump conditions for the boundedness of the Hardy-Littlewood maximal operator M from L^p(v) into L^p(w), where 1<p<\infty. The conditions in question are obtained by replacing the average of \sigma=v^{-\frac{1}{p-1}} in the Muckenhoupt A_p-condition by an average with respect to certain Banach function space, and are known to be sufficient for the two-weighted maximal inequality. We show that these conditions are in general not necessary for the boundedness of M from L^p(v) into L^p(w).
