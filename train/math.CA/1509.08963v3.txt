The complete Lipschitz-Hankel integrals (LHIs) include the Laplace transforms of the Bessel functions, multiplied by powers. Such Laplace transforms can be evaluated using associated Legendre functions. It is noted that there are errors in published versions of these evaluations, and a merged and emended list of seven transforms is given. Errata for standard reference works, such as the table of Gradshteyn and Ryzhik, are also given. Most of the errors are attributable to inconsistent normalization of the Legendre functions. These transforms can be viewed as limits of incomplete LHIs, which find application in communication theory.
