We consider quasiradial Fourier multipliers, i.e. multipliers of the form m(a(\xi)) for a class of distance functions a. We give a necessary and sufficient condition for the multiplier transformations to be bounded on L^p for a certain range of p. In addition, when m is compactly supported in (0,\infty), we give a similar result for associated maximal operators.
