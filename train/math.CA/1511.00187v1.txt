In this paper, we give some l_p-type inequalities about sequences satisfying certain quasi monotone type properties. As special cases, reverse l_p-type inequalities for non-negative decreasing sequences are obtained. The inequalities are closely related to Copson's and Leindler's inequalities, but the sign of the inequalities is reversed.
