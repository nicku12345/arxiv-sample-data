The goal of this work is to formulate a systematical method for looking for the simple closed form or continued fraction representation of a class of rational series. As applications, we obtain the continued fraction representations for the alternating Mathieu series and some rational series. The main tools are multiple-correction and two of Ramanujan's continued fraction formulae involving the quotient of the gamma functions.
