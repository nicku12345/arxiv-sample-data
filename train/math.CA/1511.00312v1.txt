A system of linear differential equations with oscillatory decreasing coefficients is considered. The coefficients has the form t^{-\alpha}a(t),~\alpha>0, where a(t) is trigonometric polynomial with an arbitrary set of frequencies. The asymptotic behavior of the solutions of this system as t\to\infty is studied. We construct an invertible (for sufficiently large t) change of variables that takes the original system to a system not containing oscillatory coefficients in its principal part. The study of the asymptotic behavior of the solutions of the transformed system is a simpler problem. As an example, the following equation is considered:  \frac{d^2x}{dt^2}+\left(1+\frac{\sin\lambda t} {t^\alpha}\right)x=0,  where \lambda and \alpha,~ 0<\alpha\le 1, are real numbers.
