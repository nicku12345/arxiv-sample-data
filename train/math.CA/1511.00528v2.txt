We develop a new general method to prove various non-doubling local Tb theorems. The method combines the non-homogeneous good lambda method of Tolsa, the big pieces Tb theorem of Nazarov-Treil-Volberg and a new change of measure argument based on stopping time techniques. We also improve known results and discuss some further applications.
