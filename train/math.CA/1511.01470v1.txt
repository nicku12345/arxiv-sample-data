In a previous paper by the authors the existence of Haar projections with growing norms in Sobolev-Triebel-Lizorkin spaces has been shown via a probabilistic argument. This existence was sufficient to determine the precise range of Triebel-Lizorkin spaces for which the Haar system is an unconditional basis. The aim of the present paper is to give simple deterministic examples of Haar projections that show this growth behavior in the respective range of parameters.
