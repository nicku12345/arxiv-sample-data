We study the interior problem of tomography. The starting point is the Gelfand-Graev formula, which converts the tomographic data into the finite Hilbert transform (FHT) of an unknown function f along a collection of lines. Pick one such line, call it the x-axis, and assume that the function to be reconstructed depends on a one-dimensional argument by restricting f to the line. Let \Omega_1 be the interval where f is supported, and \Omega_2 be the interval where the Hilbert transform of f can be computed using the Gelfand-Graev formula. The equation we study is H_1 f=g|_{\Omega_2}, where H_1 is the FHT that integrates over \Omega_1 and gives the result on \Omega_2, i.e. H_1: L^2(\Omega_1)\to L^2(\Omega_2). In the case of the interior problem the tomographic data are truncated, and \Omega_1 is no longer a subset of \Omega_2. In this paper we consider the case when the intervals \Omega_1=(a_1,0) and \Omega_2=(0,a_2) are adjacent. Here a_1 < 0 < a_2. First we find a differential operator L that commutes with H_1. Using the Titchmarsh-Weyl theory, we show that L has only continuous spectrum and obtain two isometric transformations U_1, U_2, such that U_2 H_1 U_1^* is the multiplication operator with the function \sigma(\lambda), \lambda\geq(a_1^2+a_2^2)/8. Here \lambda is the spectral parameter. Then we show that \sigma(\lambda)\to0 as \lambda\to\infty exponentially fast. We also obtain the leading asymptotic behavior of the kernels involved in the integral operators U_1, U_2 as \lambda\to\infty. When the intervals are symmetric, i.e. -a_1=a_2, the operators U_1, U_2 are obtained explicitly in terms of hypergeometric functions.
