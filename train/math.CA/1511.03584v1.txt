We deal with positive solutions for the Neumann boundary value problem associated with the scalar second order ODE  u" + q(t)g(u) = 0, \quad t \in [0, T],  where g: [0, +\infty[\, \to \mathbb{R} is positive on \,]0, +\infty[\, and q(t) is an indefinite weight. Complementary to previous investigations in the case \int_0^T q(t) < 0, we provide existence results for a suitable class of weights having (small) positive mean, when g'(x) < 0 at infinity. Our proof relies on a shooting argument for a suitable equivalent planar system of the type  x' = y, \qquad y' = h(x)y^2 + q(t),  with h(x) a continuous function defined on the whole real line.
