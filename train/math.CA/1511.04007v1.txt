It is shown that if a non-zero function f\in B_\sigma has infinitely many double zeros on the real axis, then there exists at least one pair of consecutive zeros whose distance apart is greater than \dfrac{\pi}{\sigma}\tau^{1/4}, \tau\approx5.0625. A frame algorithm is provided for reconstructing a function f\in B_\sigma from its nonuniform samples \{f^{(j)}(x_i):j=0,1,\dots, k-1, i\in\mathbb{Z}\} with maximum gap condition, \sup\limits_i(x_{i+1}-x_i)=\delta<\dfrac{1}{\sigma}c_k^{1/2k}, where c_k is a Wirtinger-Sobolev constant, using Hermite interpolation.
