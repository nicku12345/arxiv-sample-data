We develop a new method of proving vector-valued estimates in harmonic analysis, which we like to call "the helicoidal method". As a consequence of it, we are able to give affirmative answers to some questions that have been circulating for some time. In particular, we show that the tensor product BHT \otimes \Pi between the bilinear Hilbert transform BHT and a paraproduct \Pi satisfies the same L^p estimates as the BHT itself, solving completely a problem introduced in a paper of Muscalu, Pipher, Tao and Thiele. Then, we prove that for "locally L^2 exponents" the corresponding vector valued \overrightarrow{BHT} satisfies (again) the same L^p estimates as the BHT itself. Before the present work there was not even a single example of such exponents.   Finally, we prove a bi-parameter Leibniz rule in mixed norm L^p spaces, answering a question of Kenig in nonlinear dispersive PDE.
