New bispectral polynomials orthogonal on a quadratic bi-lattice are obtained from a truncation of Wilson polynomials. Recurrence relation and difference equation are provided. The recurrence coefficients can be encoded in a perturbed persymmetric Jacobi matrix. The orthogonality relation and an explicit expression in terms of hypergeometric functions are also given. Special cases and connections with the para-Krawtchouk polynomials and the dual-Hahn polynomials are also discussed.
