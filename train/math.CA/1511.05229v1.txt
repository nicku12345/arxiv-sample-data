This paper studies the uncertainty principle for spherical h-harmonic expansions on the unit sphere of \mathbb{R}^d associated with a weight function invariant under a general finite reflection group, which is in full analogy with the classical Heisenberg inequality. Our proof is motivated by a new decomposition of the Dunkl-Laplace-Beltrami operator on the weighted sphere.
