In this paper we prove sharp L^\infty-L^\infty-L^\infty decay for certain trilinear oscillatory integral forms of convolution type on \mathbb R^2. These estimates imply earlier L^2-L^2-L^2 results obtained by the second author as well as corresponding sharp, stable sublevel set estimates of the form studied by Christ and Christ, Li, Tao, and Thiele. New connections to the multilinear results of Phong, Stein, and Sturm are also considered.
