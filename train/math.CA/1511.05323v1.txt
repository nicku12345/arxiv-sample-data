We consider the Pearcey integral P(x,y) for large values of \vert y\vert and bounded values of \vert x\vert. The integrand of the Pearcey integral oscillates wildly in this region and the asymptotic saddle point analysis is complicated. Then we consider here the modified saddle point method introduced in [Lopez, P\'erez and Pagola, 2009]. With this method, the analysis is simpler and it is possible to derive a complete asymptotic expansion of P(x,y) for large \vert y\vert. The asymptotic analysis requires the study of three different regions for \arg y separately. In the three regions, the expansion is given in terms of inverse powers of y^{2/3} and the coefficients are elementary functions of x. The accuracy of the approximation is illustrated with some numerical experiments.
