In this paper, we construct a linear positive operators q-parametric Szasz-Mirakjan operators generated by the q-Dunkl generalization of the exponential function. We obtain Korovkin's type approximation theorem for these operators and compute convergence of these operators by using the modulus of continuity. Furthermore, the rate of convergence of the operators for functions belonging to the Lipschitz class is presented.
