The main goal of this paper is to give potential theoretical approach to study the Dunkl Laplacian \Delta_k which is a standard example of differential-difference operators. By introducing the Green kernel relative to \Delta_k, we prove that the Dunkl Laplacian generates a balayage space and we investigate the associated family of harmonic measures. Therefore, by mean of harmonic kernels, we give a characterization of all \Delta_k-harmonic functions on large class of open subsets U of \mathbb{R}^d. We also establish existence and uniqueness result of a solution of the corresponding Dirichlet problem.
