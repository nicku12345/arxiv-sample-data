Let \Omega\subset\mathbb R^2 be a countably connected domain. To any closed differential form of degree 1 in \Omega with components in L^2(\Omega) one associates the sequence of its periods around holes in \Omega, that is around bounded connected components of \mathbb R^2\setminus \Omega. For which \Omega the collection of such period sequences coincides with \ell^2? We give the answer in terms of metric properties of holes in \Omega.
