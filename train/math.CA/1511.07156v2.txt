In this paper we present several new classes of logarithmically completely monotonic functions. Our functions have in common that they are defined in terms of the q-gamma and q-digamma functions. As an applications of this results, some inequalities for the q-gamma and the q-digamma functions are established. Some of the given results generalized theorems due to Alzer and Berg and C.-P. Chen and F. Qi.
