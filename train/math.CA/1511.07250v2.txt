Let 1\le p_0<p,q <q_0\le \infty. Given a pair of weights (w,\sigma) and a sparse family \mathcal S, we study the two weight inequality for the following bi-sublinear form \[ B(f, g)= \sum_{Q\in\mathcal S}\langle |f|^{p_0}\rangle_Q^{\frac 1{p_0}} \langle|g|^{q_0'}\rangle_Q^{\frac 1{q_0'}}\lambda_Q\le \mathcal N\|f\|_{L^{p}(w)}\|g\|_{L^{q'}(\sigma)}. \] When \lambda_Q=|Q| and p=q, Bernicot, Frey and Petermichl showed that B(f,g) dominates \langle Tf, g\rangle for a large class of singular non-kernel operators. We give a characterization for the above inequality and then obtain the mixed A_p-A_\infty estimates and the corresponding entropy bounds when \lambda_Q=|Q| and p=q. We also proposed a new conjecture which implies both the one supremum conjecture and the separated bump conjecture.
