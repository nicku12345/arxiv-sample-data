Using Dunkl theory, we introduce into consideration some weighted L_p-spaces on [-1,1] and on the unit Euclidean sphere \mathbb{S}^{d-1}, d\geq 2. Then we define a family of linear bounded operators \{V_\kappa^p(x)\colon x\in\mathbb{S}^{d-1}\} acting from the L_p-space on [-1,1] to the L_p-space on \mathbb{S}^{d-1}, 1\leq p<\infty. We establish a necessary and sufficient condition for a function g belonging to the L_p-space on [-1,1] such that the family of functions \{V_\kappa^p(x;g)\colon x\in\mathbb{S}^{d-1}\} is fundamental in the L_p-space on \mathbb{S}^{d-1}.
