We find asymptotic equalities for exact upper bounds of approximations by Fourier sums in uniform metric on classes of 2\pi-periodic functions, representable in the form of convolutions of functions \varphi, which belong to unit balls of spaces L_{p}, with generalized Poisson kernels. For obtained asymptotic equalities we introduce the estimates of remainder, which are expressed in the explicit form via the parameters of the problem.
