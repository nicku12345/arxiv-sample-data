We show that the multiwavelets, introduced by Alpert in 1993, are related to type I Legendre-Angelesco multiple orthogonal polynomials. We give explicit formulas for these Legendre-Angelesco polynomials and for the Alpert multiwavelets. The multiresolution analysis can be done entirely using Legendre polynomials, and we give an algorithm, using Cholesky factorization, to compute the multiwavelets and a method, using the Jacobi matrix for Legendre polynomials, to compute the matrices in the scaling relation for any size of the multiplicity of the multiwavelets.
