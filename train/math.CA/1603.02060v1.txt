In this work we study the mass-spring system \begin{equation} \ddot x + \alpha \dot x + x = - \frac{\lambda} {(1+x)^{2}}, \label{e:inertia} \end{equation} which is a simplified model for an electrostatically actuated MEMS device. The static pull-in value is \lambda^{*}=\frac{4}{27}, which corresponds to the largest value of \lambda for which there exists at least one stationary solution. For \lambda > \lambda^{*} there are no stationary solutions and x(t) achieves the value -1 in finite time: {\it touchdown} occurs. We establish the existence of a dynamic pull-in value \lambda_{d}^{*}(\alpha) \in (0, \lambda^{*}), defined for \alpha \in [0,\infty), which is a threshold in the sense that x(t) approaches a stable stationary solution as t \to \infty for 0 < \lambda < \lambda_{d}^{*}(\alpha), while touchdown occurs for \lambda > \lambda_{d}^{*}(\alpha). This dynamic pull-in value is a continuous, strictly increasing function of \alpha and \lim_{\alpha\to\infty} \lambda_{d}^{*}(\alpha)= \lambda^{*}.
