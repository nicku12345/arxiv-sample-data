In \cite{05} B. Ebanks and H. Stetk{\ae}r obtained the solutions of the functional equation f(xy)-f(\sigma(y)x)=g(x)h(y) where \sigma is an involutive automorphism and f,g,h are complex-valued functions, in the setting of a group G and a monoid M.   Our main goal is to determine the complex-valued solutions of the following more general version of this equation, viz f(xy)-\mu(y)f(\sigma(y)x)=g(x)h(y) where \mu: G\longrightarrow \mathbb{C} is a multiplicative function such that \mu(x\sigma(x))=1 for all x\in G. As an application we find the complex-valued solutions (f,g,h) on groups of the equation f(xy)+\mu(y)g(\sigma(y)x)=h(x)h(y).
