We prove bounds for the truncated directional Hilbert transform in L^p(\mathbb{R}^2) for any 1<p<\infty under a combination of a Lipschitz assumption and a lacunarity assumption. It is known that a lacunarity assumption alone is not sufficient to yield boundedness for p=2, and it is a major question in the field whether a Lipschitz assumption alone suffices, at least for some p.
