We study the monotonic behaviour of the zeros of the multiple Jacobi-Angelesco orthogonal polynomials, in the diagonal case, with respect to the parameters \alpha,\beta and \gamma. We prove that the zeros are monotonic functions of \alpha and \gamma and consider some special cases of how the zeros depend on \beta, especially in the presence of symmetry. As a consequence we obtain results about monotonicity of zeros of Jacobi-Laguerre and Laguerre-Hermite multiple orthogonal polynomials too.
