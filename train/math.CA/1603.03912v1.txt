In this paper, we first introduce some new Morrey type spaces containing generalized Morrey space and weighted Morrey space as special cases. Then we discuss the strong type and weak type estimates for a class of Calder\'on--Zygmund type operators T_\theta in these new Morrey type spaces. Furthermore, the strong type estimate and endpoint estimate of commutators [b,T_{\theta}] formed by b and T_{\theta} are established. Also we study related problems about two-weight, weak type inequalities for T_{\theta} and [b,T_{\theta}] in the Morrey type spaces and give partial results.
