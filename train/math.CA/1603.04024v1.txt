Our aim is to extend some trigonometric inequalities to Bessel functions. Moreover, we extend the hyperbolic analogue of these trigonometric inequalities. As an application of these results we present a generalization of Cusa-type inequality to modified Bessel function. Our main motivation to write this paper is a recent publication of Chen and S\'andor, which we wish to complement.
