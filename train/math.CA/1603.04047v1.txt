Let \Omega\subset \mathbb{R}^{n} be a bounded open set. Given 2\leq m\leq n, we construct a convex function \phi :\Omega\to \mathbb{R} whose gradient f= \nabla \phi is a H\"older continuous homeomorphism, f is the identity on \partial \Omega, the derivative D f has rank m-1 a.e.\ in \Omega and D f is in the weak L^{m} space L^{m,w}. The proof is based on convex integration and staircase laminates.
