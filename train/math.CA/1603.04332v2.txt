This paper is a sequel to our paper Rev. Mat. Iberoam. 32 (2016), no. 1, 79-174. Let T be a standard fractional Calderon Zygmund operator. Assume appropriate Muckenhoupt and quasienergy side conditions. Then we show that T is bounded from one weighted space to another if the quasicube testing conditions hold for T and its dual, and if the quasiweak boundedness property holds for T. Conversely, if T is bounded, then the quasitesting conditions hold, and the quasiweak boundedness condition holds. If the vector of fractional Riesz transforms (or more generally a strongly elliptic vector of transforms) is bounded, then the appropriate Muckenhoupt conditions hold. We do not know if our quasienergy conditions are necessary in higher dimensions, except for certain situations in which one of the measures is one-dimensional as in arXiv:1310.4820 and arXiv:1505.07822v4, and for certain side conditions placed on the measures such as doubling and k-energy dispersed, which when k=n-1 is similar to the condition of uniformly full dimension in Lacey and Wick arXiv:1312.6163v3.
