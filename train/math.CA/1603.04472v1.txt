The concept of uniform distribution in [0,1] is extended for a certain strictly separated maximal (in the sense of cardinality) family (\lambda_t)_{t \in [0,1]} of invariant extensions of the linear Lebesgue measure \lambda in [0.1], and it is shown that the \lambda_t^{\infty} measure of the set of all \lambda_t-uniformly distributed sequences is equal to 1, where \lambda_t^{\infty} denotes the infinite power of the measure \lambda_t. This is an analogue of Hlawka's (1956) theorem for \lambda_t-uniformly distributed sequences. An analogy of Weyl's (1916) theorem is obtained in similar manner.
