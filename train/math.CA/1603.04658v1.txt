In this paper, we first introduce some new Morrey type spaces containing generalized Morrey space and weighted Morrey space with two weights as special cases. Then we give the weighted strong type and weak type estimates for fractional integral operators I_\alpha in these new Morrey type spaces. Furthermore, the weighted strong type estimate and endpoint estimate of linear commutators [b,I_{\alpha}] formed by b and I_{\alpha} are established. Also we study related problems about two-weight, weak type inequalities for I_{\alpha} and [b,I_{\alpha}] in the Morrey type spaces and give partial results.
