We consider how some methods of uniform and nonuniform interpolation by translates of radial basis functions -- specifically the so-called general multiquadrics -- perform in the presence of certain types of noise. These techniques provide some new avenues for interpolation on bounded domains that is different from the existing literature by using fast Fourier transform methods to approximate cardinal functions associated with the RBF.
