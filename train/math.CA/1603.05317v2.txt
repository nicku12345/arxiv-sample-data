We establish a uniform domination of the family of trilinear multiplier forms with singularity over a one-dimensional subspace by positive sparse forms involving L^p-averages. This class includes the adjoint forms to the bilinear Hilbert transforms. Our result strengthens the L^p-boundedness proved in \cite{MTT} and entails as a corollary a rich multilinear weighted theory. In particular, we obtain L^{q_1}(v_1) \times L^{q_2}(v_2)-boundedness of the bilinear Hilbert transform when the weights v_j belong to the class A_{\frac{q+1}{2}}\cap RH_2. Our proof relies on a stopping time construction based on newly developed localized outer-L^p embedding theorems for the wave packet transform. In an Appendix, we show how our domination principle can be applied to recover the vector-valued bounds for the bilinear Hilbert transforms recently proved by Benea and Muscalu.
