In this paper we show that certain sets are dense in \mathbb{R}. We give some applications. For example, we show an analytical proof that q^{\frac{1}{n}}, q is a prime number and e; are irrational numbers. As another application we show: If f is an locally integrable function on \mathbb{R}-\{0\} satisfying \int_x ^{px}f(t)dt and \int_x ^{qx}f(t)dt are constant with \frac{\ln p}{\ln q} is an irrational number; implies f(t)=\frac{c}{t}\,\,\ a.e., where c is constant; which is already considered in \cite{b1} for the case when f is continuous.
