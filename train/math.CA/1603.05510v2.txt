In the present paper, we construct and investigate a variant of modified (p,q)-Baskakov operators, which reproduce the test function x^2. The order of approximation of the operators via K-functional and second order, usual modulus of continuity, weighted approximation properties are disscussed. In the end some graphical results, comparison with (p,q)-Baskakov operators is explained.
