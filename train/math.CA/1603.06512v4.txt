We study the extension estimates for paraboloids in d-dimensional vector spaces over finite fields F_q with q elements. We use the connection between L^2 based restriction estimates and L^p\to L^r extension estimates for paraboloids. As a consequence, we improve the L^2\to L^r extension results obtained by A. Lewko and M. Lewko in even dimensions d\ge 6 and odd dimensions d=4\ell+3 for \ell \in \mathbb N. Our results extend the consequences for 3-D paraboloids due to M. Lewko to higher dimensions. We also clarifies conjectures on finite field extension problems for paraboloids.
