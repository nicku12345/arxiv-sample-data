Using continuation methods and bifurcation theory, we study the exact multiplicity of periodic solutions, and the global solution structure, for three classes of periodically forced equations with singularities, including the equations arising in micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS), the ones in condensed matter physics, as well as A.C. Lazer and S. Solimini's \cite{LS} problem.
