We study matrix three term relations for orthogonal polynomials in two variables constructed from orthogonal polynomials in one variable. Using the three term recurrence relation for the involved univariate orthogonal polynomials, the explicit expression for the matrix coefficients in these three term relations are deduced. These matrices are diagonal or tridiagonal with entries computable from the one variable coefficients in the respective three term recurrence relation. Moreover, some interesting particular cases are considered.
