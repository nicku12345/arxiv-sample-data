The purpose of this paper is to find the characterization of the Sheffer polynomial sets satisfying the d-orthogonality conditions. The generating function form of these polynomial sets is given in Theorem 2.2. As applications of the Theorem 2.2, we revisit the d-orthogonal polynomial sets exist in the literature and discover new d-orthogonal polynomial sets. Moreover, we obtain the d-dimensional functional vector ensuring the d-orthogonality of these new polynomial sets.
