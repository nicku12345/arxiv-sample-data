Let K be a non-polar compact subset of \mathbb{R} and \mu_K denote the equilibrium measure of K. Furthermore, let P_n\left(\cdot, \mu_K\right) be the n-th monic orthogonal polynomial for \mu_K. It is shown that \|P_n\left(\cdot, \mu_K\right)\|_{L^2(\mu_K)}, the Hilbert norm of P_n\left(\cdot, \mu_K\right) in L^2(\mu_K), is bounded below by \mathrm{Cap}(K)^n for each n\in\mathbb{N}. A sufficient condition is given for \displaystyle\left(\|P_n\left(\cdot;\mu_K\right)\|_{L^2(\mu_K)}/\mathrm{Cap}(K)^n\right)_{n=1}^\infty to be unbounded. More detailed results are presented for sets which are union of finitely many intervals.
