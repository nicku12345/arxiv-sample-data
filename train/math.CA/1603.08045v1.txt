In literature the Hermite-Hadamard inequality was eligible for many reasons, one of the most surprising and interesting that the Hermite-Hadamard inequality combine the midpoint and trapezoid formulae in an inequality. In this work, a Hermite-Hadamard like inequality that combines the composite trapezoid and composite midpoint formulae is proved. So that, the classical Hermite-Hadamard inequality becomes a special case of the presented result. Some Ostrowski's type inequalities for convex functions are proved as well.
