In this paper, let L=L_{0}+V be a Schr\"{o}dinger type operator where L_{0} is higher order elliptic operator with complex coefficients in divergence form and V is signed measurable function, under the strongly subcritical assumption on V, the authors study the L^{q} boundedness of Riesz transforms \nabla^{m}L^{-1/2} for q\leq 2 and obtain a sharp result. Furthermore, the authors impose extra regularity assumptions on V to obtain the L^{q} boundedness of Riesz transforms \nabla^{m}L^{-1/2} for q>2. As an application, the main results can be applied to the operator L=(-\Delta)^{m}-\gamma|x|^{-2m} for suitable \gamma
