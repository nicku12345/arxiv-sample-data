In this paper we construct Stancu type q-Kantrovich-Sz\'asz-Mirakjan operators generated by Dunkl generalization of the exponential function. We obtain some approximation results using the Korovkin approximation theorem and the weighted Korovkin-type theorem for these operators. We also study convergence properties by using the modulus of continuity and the rate of convergence of these operators for functions belonging to the Lipschitz class. Furthermore, we obtain the rate of convergence in terms of the classical, second order, and weighted modulus of continuity.
