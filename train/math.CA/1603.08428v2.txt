In this paper, we develop an elementary proof of the change of variables in multiple integrals. Our proof is based on an induction argument. Assuming the formula for (m-1)-integrals, we define the integral over hypersurface in Rm, establish the divergent theorem and then use the divergent theorem to prove the formula for m-integrals. In addition to its simplicity, an advantage of our approach is that it yields the Brouwer Fixed Point Theorem as a corollary.
