In this paper, we introduce a generalization of the q-Meyer-Konig and Zeller operators by means of the (p,q)-integers as well as of the (p,q)-Gaussian binomial coefficients. For  0< q < p <= 1, the sequence of the (p,q)-Meyer-Konig and Zeller operators denoted by M_n,p,q and some results based on statistical convergence and direct theorems is obtained. Furthermore, we show comparisons and some illustrative graphics for the convergence of operators to a function.
