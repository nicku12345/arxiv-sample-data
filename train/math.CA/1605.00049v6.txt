The aim of this paper is twofold. The first part is concerned with the associated and the so-called co-polynomials, i.e. new sequences obtained when finite perturbations of the recurrence coefficients are considered. In the second part we present nice Casorati determinants with co-polynomials entries. We look at Darboux factorization of lower Hessenberg matrices and the corresponding polynomials, then combine it with totally nonnegative matrices to find out sufficient conditions for zeros to be real and distinct. In addition, kernel polynomials, d-symmetric sequences as well as quasi-orthogonality from linear combination are discussed as well. Therefore, new characterization of the d-quasi-orthogonality which corresponds to the first structure relation in the standard case is constructed.
