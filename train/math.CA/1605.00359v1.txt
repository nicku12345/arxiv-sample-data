In this paper we introduce the notions of q-Duhamel product and q-integration operator. We prove that the classical Wiener algebra W(\mathbb{D}) of all analytic functions on the unit disc \mathbb{D} of the complex plane \mathbb{C} with absolutely convergent Taylor series is a Banach algebra with respect to q-Duhamel product. We also describe the cyclic vectors of the q-integration operator on W(\mathbb{D}) and characterize its commutant in terms of the q-Duhamel product operators.
