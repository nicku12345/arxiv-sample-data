We prove pointwise variational Lp bounds for a bilinear Fourier integral operator in a large but not necessarily sharp range of exponents. This result is a joint strengthening of the corresponding bounds for the classical Carleson operator, the bilinear Hilbert transform, the variation norm Carleson operator, and the bi-Carleson operator. Terry Lyon's rough path theory allows for extension of our result to multilinear estimates. We consider our result a proof of concept for a wider array of similar estimates with possible applications to ordinary differential equations.
