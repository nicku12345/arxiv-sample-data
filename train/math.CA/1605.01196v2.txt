To each nonzero sequence s:= \{s_{n}\}_{n \geq 0} of real numbers we associate the Hankel determinants D_{n} = \det \mathcal{H}_{n} of the Hankel matrices \mathcal{H}_{n}:= (s_{i + j})_{i, j = 0}^{n}, n \geq 0, and the nonempty set N_{s}:= \{n \geq 1 \, | \, D_{n-1} \neq 0 \}. We also define the Hankel determinant polynomials P_0:=1, and P_n, n\geq 1 as the determinant of the Hankel matrix \mathcal H_n modified by replacing the last row by the monomials 1, x, \ldots, x^n. Clearly P_n is a polynomial of degree at most n and of degree n if and only if n\in N_s . Kronecker established in 1881 that if N_s  is finite then rank \mathcal{H}_{n} = r for each n \geq r-1, where r := \max N_s . By using an approach suggested by I.S.Iohvidov in 1969 we give a short proof of this result and a transparent proof of the conditions on a real sequence \{t_n\}_{n\geq 0} to be of the form t_n=D_n, n\geq 0 for a real sequence \{s_n\}_{n\geq 0}. This is the Hankel determinant problem. We derive from the Kronecker identities that each Hankel determinant polynomial  P_n  satisfying degP_n = n\geq 1 is preceded by a nonzero polynomial P_{n-1} whose degree can be strictly less than n-1 and which has no common zeros with  P_n . As an application of our results we obtain a new proof of a recent theorem by Berg and Szwarc about positive semidefiniteness of all Hankel matrices provided that D_0 > 0, \ldots, D_{r-1} > 0  and D_n=0 for all n\geq r.
