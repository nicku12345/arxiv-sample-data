A characterization of finitely generated shift-invariant subspaces is given when generators are g-minimal. An algorithm is given for the determination of the coefficients in the well known representation of the Fourier transform of an element of the finitely generated shift-invariant subspace as a linear combination of Fourier transformations of generators. An estimate for the norms of those coefficients is derived. For the proof a sort of orthogonalization procedure for generators is used which reminds the well known Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization process.
