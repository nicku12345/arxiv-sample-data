We prove that the superlinear indefinite equation \begin{equation*} u" + a(t)u^{p} = 0, \end{equation*} where p > 1 and a(t) is a T-periodic sign-changing function satisfying the (sharp) mean value condition \int_{0}^{T} a(t)~\!dt < 0, has positive subharmonic solutions of order k for any large integer k, thus providing a further contribution to a problem raised by G. J. Butler in its pioneering paper (JDE, 1976). The proof, which applies to a larger class of indefinite equations, combines coincidence degree theory (yielding a positive harmonic solution) with the Poincar\'e-Birkhoff fixed point theorem (giving subharmonic solutions oscillating around it).
