Let w_{\alpha}(t)=t^{\alpha}\,e^{-t}, \alpha>-1, be the Laguerre weight function, and |\cdot|_{w_\alpha} denote the associated L_2-norm, i.e.,  | f|_{w_\alpha}:=\Big(\int_{0}^{\infty}w_{\alpha}(t)| f(t)|^2\,dt\Big)^{1/2}.  Denote by {\cal P}_n the set of algebraic polynomials of degree not exceeding n. We study the best constant c_n(\alpha) in the Markov inequality in this norm,  | p^{\prime}|_{w_\alpha}\leq c_n(\alpha)\,| p|_{w_\alpha}\,,\quad p\in {\cal P}_n\,,  namely the constant  c_{n}(\alpha)=\sup_{\mathop{}^{p\in {\cal P}_n}_{p\ne 0}}\frac{| p^{\prime}|_{w_\alpha}}{| p|_{w_\alpha}}\,,  and we are also interested in its asymptotic value  c(\alpha)=\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\frac{c_{n}(\alpha)}{n}\,.  In this paper we obtain lower and upper bounds for both c_{n}(\alpha) and c(\alpha). % Note that according to a result of P. D\"{o}rfler from 2002, c(\alpha)=[j_{(\alpha-1)/2,1}]^{-1}, with j_{\nu,1} being the first positive zero of the Bessel function J_{\nu}(z), hence our bounds for c(\alpha) imply bounds for j_{(\alpha-1)/2,1} as well.
