We give several expansion and identities involving the Ramanujan function A_q and the Stieltjes--Wigert polynomials. Special values of our idenitities give m-versions of some of the items on the Slater list of Rogers-Ramanujan type identities. We also study some bilateral extensions of certain transformations in the theory of basic hypergeometric functions.
