The aim of this paper is to study variation detracting property and con- vergence in variation of the Bernstein-Durrmeyer modifications of the classical Bernstein operators in the space of functions of bounded variation. These problems are studied with respect to the variation seminorm. Moreover we also study the problem of the rate of approximation.
