It is well-known that the L^p boundedness and weak (1,1) estiamte (\lambda>2) of the classical Littlewood-Paley g_{\lambda}^{*}-function was first studied by Stein, and the weak (p,p) (p>1) estimate was later given by Fefferman for \lambda=2/p. In this paper, we investigated the L^p(\mu) boundedness of the non-homogeneous Littlewood-Paley g_{\lambda,\mu}^{*}-function with non-convolution type kernels and a power bounded measure \mu:  g_{\lambda,\mu}^*(f)(x) = \bigg(\iint_{{\mathbb R}^{n+1}_{+}} \Big(\frac{t}{t + |x - y|}\Big)^{m \lambda} |\theta_t^\mu f(y)|^2 \frac{d\mu(y) dt}{t^{m+1}}\bigg)^{1/2},\ x \in {\mathbb R}^n,\ \lambda > 1,  where \theta_t^\mu f(y) = \int_{{\mathbb R}^n} s_t(y,z) f(z) d\mu(z), and s_t is a non-convolution type kernel. Based on a big piece prior boundedness, we first gave a sufficient condition for the L^p(\mu) boundedness of g_{\lambda,\mu}^*. This was done by means of the non-homogeneous good lambda method. Then, using the methods of dyadic analysis, we demonstrated a big piece global Tb theorem. Finally, we obtaind a sufficient and necessary condition for L^p(\mu) boundedness of g_{\lambda,\mu}^*-function. It is worth noting that our testing conditions are weak (1,1) type with respect to measures.
