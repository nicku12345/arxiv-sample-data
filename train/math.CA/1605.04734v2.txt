We show that, given some lacunary sequence of angles \mathbf{\theta}=(\theta_j)_{j\in\N} not converging too fast to zero, it is possible to build a rare differentiation basis \mathcal{B} of rectangles parallel to the axes that differentiates L^1(\mathbb{R}^2) while the basis \mathcal{B}_{\mathbf{\theta}} obtained from \mathcal{B} by allowing its elements to rotate around their lower left vertex by the angles \theta_j, j\in\mathbb{N}, fails to differentiate all Orlicz spaces lying between L^1(\mathbb{R}^2) and L\log L(\mathbb{R}^2).
