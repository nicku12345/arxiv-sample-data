In this paper we study the solutions of the integral Van Vleck's functional equation for the sine \int_{S}f(x\tau(y)t)d\mu(t)-\int_{S}f(xyt)d\mu(t) =2f(x)f(y),\; x,y\in S and the integral Kannappan's functional equation \int_{S}f(xyt)d\mu(t)+\int_{S}f(x\tau(y)t)d\mu(t) =2f(x)f(y),\; x,y\in S, where S is a semigroup, \tau is an involution of S and \mu is a measure that is linear combinations of point measures (\delta_{z_{i}})_{i\in I}, such that for all i\in I, z_{i} is contained in the center of S. \\ We express the solutions of the first equation by means of multiplicative functions on S, and we prove that the solutions of the second equation are closely related to the solutions of the classic d'Alembert's functional equation with involution.
