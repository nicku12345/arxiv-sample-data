In the present article, we deal with the overconvergence of the Sz?asz-Durrmeyer-Chlodowsky operators. Here we study the approximation properties e.g. upper estimates, Voronovskaja type result for these operators attached to analytic functions in compact disks. Also, we discuss the exact order in simultaneous approximation by these operators and its derivatives and the asymptotic result with quantitative upper estimate. In such a way, we put in evidence the overconvergence phenomenon for the Sz?asz-Durrmeyer-Chlodowsky operators, namely the extensions of approximation properties with exact quantitative estimates and orders of these convergencies to sets in the complex plane that contain the interval [0,\infty).
