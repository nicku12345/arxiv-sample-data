In \cite{NaTa} Naor and Tao extended to the metric setting the O(d \log d) bounds given by Stein and Str\"omberg for Lebesgue measure in \mathbb{R}^d, deriving these bounds first from a localization result, and second, from a random Vitali lemma. Here we show that the Stein-Str\"omberg original argument can also be adapted to the metric setting, giving a third proof. We also weaken the hypotheses, and additionally, we sharpen the estimates for Lebesgue measure.
