We prove L^p bounds for partial polynomial Carleson operators along monomial curves (t,t^m) in the plane \mathbb{R}^2 with a phase polynomial consisting of a single monomial. These operators are "partial" in the sense that we consider linearizing stopping-time functions that depend on only one of the two ambient variables. A motivation for studying these partial operators is the curious feature that, despite their apparent limitations, for certain combinations of curve and phase, L^2 bounds for partial operators along curves imply the full strength of the L^2 bound for a one-dimensional Carleson operator, and for a quadratic Carleson operator. Our methods, which can at present only treat certain combinations of curves and phases, in some cases adapt a TT^* method to treat phases involving fractional monomials, and in other cases use a known vector-valued variant of the Carleson-Hunt theorem.
