In the scalar setting, the power functions |x|^{\gamma}, for -1 < \gamma<1, are the canonical examples of A_2 weights. In this paper, we study two types of power functions in the matrix setting, with the goal of obtaining canonical examples of A_2 matrix weights. We first study Type 1 matrix power functions, which are n\times n matrix functions whose entries are of the form a|x|^{\gamma}. Our main result characterizes when these power functions are A_2 matrix weights and has two extensions to Type 1 power functions of several variables. We also study Type 2 matrix power functions, which are n\times n matrix functions whose eigenvalues are of the form a|x|^{\gamma}. We find necessary conditions for these to be A_2 matrix weights and give an example showing that even nice functions of this form can fail to be A_2 matrix weights.
