Let T be a multilinear Calder\'on-Zygmund operator of type \omega with \omega(t) being nondecreasing and satisfying a kind of Dini's type condition. Let T_{\Pi\vec{b}} be the iterated commutators of T with BMO functions. The weighted strong and weak L(\log{L})-type endpoint estimates for T_{\Pi\vec{b}} with multiple weights are established. Some boundedness properties on weighted variable exponent Lebesgue spaces are also obtained.   As applications, multiple weighted estimates for iterated commutators of paraproducts and bilinear pseudo-differential operators with mild regularity are given.
