We consider the following oscillatory integral operator \begin{equation}\label{opera-defi-1}   T_{\alpha,m}f(x)=\int_{\mathbb R^n}e^{i(x_1^{\alpha_1} y_1^m+\cdots+x_n^{\alpha_n} y_n^m)}f(y)dy, \end{equation} where the function f is a Schwartz function. In this paper, the restriction theorem on \mathbb{S}^{n-1} for this operator is obtained. Moreover, we obtain a necessary condition which ensures the restriction theorem hold.
