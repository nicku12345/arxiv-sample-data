We give another proof of a result of Adamczewski and Bell concerning Mahler equations: A formal power series satisfying a p- and a q-Mahler equation over {\mathbb C}(x) with multiplicatively independent positive integers p and q is a rational function. The proof presented here is self-contained and is essentially a compilation of proofs contained in the recent preprint "Consistent systems of linear differential and difference equations", arXiv:1605.02616 [math.CA], by the same authors.
