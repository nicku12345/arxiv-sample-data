The main purpose of this paper is to study the existence of solutions for the following hybrid nonlinear fractional pantograph equation  \left\{\begin{aligned} &D_{0+}^\alpha \left[\frac{x(t)}{f(t,x(t),x(\varphi(t)))}\right]=g(t,x(t),x(\rho(t))),\,\,0<t<1\\ &x(0)=0, \end{aligned} \right.  where \alpha\in (0,1), \varphi and \rho are functions from [0,1] into itself and D_{0+}^\alpha denotes the Riemann-Liouville fractional derivative. The main tool of our study is a generalization of Darbo's fixed point theorem associated to measures of non-compactness. Also, we present an example illustrating our results.
