Gronwall-Bellman type inequalities entail the following implication: if a sufficiently integrable function satisfies a certain homogeneous linear integral inequality, then it is nonpositive. We present a minimal (necessary and sufficient) condition on the Borel measure underlying the integrals for this implication to hold. The condition is also a necessary prerequisite for any nontrivial bound on solutions to inhomogeneous linear integral inequalities of Gronwall-Bellman type.
