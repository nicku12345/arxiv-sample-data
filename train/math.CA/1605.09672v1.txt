Let \widehat\sigma be a Cauchy transform of a possibly complex-valued Borel measure \sigma and \{p_n\} be a system of orthonormal polynomials with respect to a measure \mu, \mathrm{supp}(\mu)\cap\mathrm{supp}(\sigma)=\varnothing. An (m,n)-th Frobenius-Pad\'e approximant to \widehat\sigma is a rational function P/Q, \mathrm{deg}(P)\leq m, \mathrm{deg}(Q)\leq n, such that the first m+n+1 Fourier coefficients of the linear form Q\widehat\sigma-P vanish when the form is developed into a series with respect to the polynomials p_n. We investigate the convergence of the Frobenius-Pad\'e approximants to \widehat\sigma along ray sequences \frac n{n+m+1}\to c>0, n-1\leq m, when \mu and \sigma are supported on intervals on the real line and their Radon-Nikodym derivatives with respect to the arcsine distribution of the respective interval are holomorphic functions.
