An algorithm for computing eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the angular spheroidal wave equation, based on a known but scarcely used method, is developed. By requiring the regularity of the wave function, represented by its series expansion, the eigenvalues appear as the zeros of a one variable function easily computable. The iterative extended Newton method is suggested as especially suitable for determining those zeros. The computation of the eigenfunctions is then immediate. The usefulness of the method, applicable also in the case of complex values of the "prolateness" parameter, is illustrated by comparing its results with those of procedures used by other authors.
