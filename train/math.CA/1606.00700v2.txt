This paper considers the Lorentz space with mixed norm of periodic functions of many variables and of the generalized Nikol'skii -- Besov classes. Estimates for the order of approximation of the generalized Nikol'skii -- Besov classes by partial sums of Fourier's series for multiple trigonometric system in Lorentz spaces with mixed norm are obtained.
