In this paper, we consider the embedding relations between any two \alpha% -modulation spaces. Based on an observation that the \alpha-modulation space with smaller \alpha can be regarded as a corresponding \alpha% -modulation space with larger \alpha, we give a complete characterization of the Fourier multipliers between \alpha-modulation spaces with different \alpha. Then we establish a full version of optimal embedding relations between \alpha-modulation spaces. As an application, we determine that the bounded operators commuting with translations between \alpha-modulation spaces are of convolution type.
