Let p be a positive number. Consider probability measure \gamma_p with density \varphi_p(y)=c_{n,p}e^{-\frac{|y|^p}{p}}. We show that the maximal surface area of a convex body in \mathbb{R}^n with respect to \gamma_p is asymptotically equal to C_p n^{\frac{3}{4}-\frac{1}{p}}, where constant C_p depends on p only. This is a generalization of Ball's and Nazarov's bounds, which were given for the case of the standard Gaussian measure \gamma_2.
