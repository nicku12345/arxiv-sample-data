For data sampled from an arbitrary density on a manifold embedded in Euclidean space, the Continuous k-Nearest Neighbors (CkNN) graph construction is introduced. It is shown that CkNN is geometrically consistent in the sense that under certain conditions, the unnormalized graph Laplacian converges to the Laplace-Beltrami operator, spectrally as well as pointwise. It is proved for compact (and conjectured for noncompact) manifolds that CkNN is the unique unweighted construction that yields a geometry consistent with the connected components of the underlying manifold in the limit of large data. Thus CkNN produces a single graph that captures all topological features simultaneously, in contrast to persistent homology, which represents each homology generator at a separate scale. As applications we derive a new fast clustering algorithm and a method to identify patterns in natural images topologically. Finally, we conjecture that CkNN is topologically consistent, meaning that the homology of the Vietoris-Rips complex (implied by the graph Laplacian) converges to the homology of the underlying manifold (implied by the Laplace-de Rham operators) in the limit of large data.
