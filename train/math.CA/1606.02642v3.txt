Representation of analytic functions as convergent series in Jacobi polynomials P_n^{(a,b)} is reformulated using a unified approach for almost all complex a, b. The coefficients of the series are given as usual integrals in the classical case (when \Re a, \Re b >-1), or by the Hadamard principal part of these integrals when they diverge. As an application it is shown that inhomogeneous hypergeometric equations do generically have a unique solution which is analytic at both singular points in the complex plane.
