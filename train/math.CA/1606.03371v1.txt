Nondegenerate truncated indefinite Stieltjes moment problem in the class \mathbf{N}_{\kappa}^{k} of generalized Stieltjes functions is considered. To describe the set of solutions of this problem we apply the Schur step-by-step algorythm, which leads to the expansion of these solutions in generalized Stieltjes continuous fractions studied recently in \cite{DK15}. Explicit formula for the resolvent matrix in terms of generalized Stieltjes polynomials is found.
