The asymptotic expansion of the Touchard polynomials T_n(z) (also known as the exponential polynomials) for large n and complex values of the variable z, where |z| may be finite or allowed to be large like O(n), has been recently considered in \cite{P1}. When z=-x is negative, it is found that there is a coalesence of two contributory saddle points when n/x=1/e. Here we determine the expansion when n and x satisfy this condition and also a uniform two-term approximation involving the Airy function in the neighbourhood of this value. Numerical results are given to illustrate the accuracy of the asymptotic approximations obtained.
