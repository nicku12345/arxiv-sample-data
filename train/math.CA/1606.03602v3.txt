We prove new results regarding the existence of positive solutions for a nonlinear periodic boundary value problem related to the Liebau phenomenon. As a consequence we obtain new sufficient conditions for the existence of a pump in a simple model. Our methodology relies on the use of classical fixed point index. Some examples are provided to illustrate our theory. We improve and complement previous results in the literature.
