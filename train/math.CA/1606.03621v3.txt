Motivated by the work of Alzer and Richards \cite{ar}, here authors study the monotonicity and convexity properties of the function \Delta_{p,q} (r) = \frac{{E_{p,q}(r) - \left( {r'} \right)^p K_{p,q}(r) }}{{r^p }} - \frac{{E'_{p,q}(r) - r^p K'_{p,q}(r) }}{{\left( {r'} \right)^p }}, where K_{p,q} and E_{p,q} denote the complete (p,q)- elliptic integrals of the first and the second kind, respectively.
