We study the regularity of solutions of one dimensional variational obstacle problems in W^{1,1} when the Lagrangian is locally H\"older continuous and globally elliptic. In the spirit of the work of Sychev ([Syc89, Syc91, Syc92]), a direct method is presented for investigating such regularity problems with obstacles. This consists of introducing a general subclass \mathcal{L} of W^{1,1}, related in a certain way to one dimensional variational obstacle problems, such that every function of \mathcal{L} has Tonelli's partial regularity, and then to prove that, depending of the regularity of the obstacles, solutions of corresponding variational problems belong to \mathcal{L}. As an application of this direct method, we prove that if the obstacles are C^{1,\sigma} then every Sobolev solution has Tonelli's partial regularity.
