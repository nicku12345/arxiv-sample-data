For s\geqslant d, we obtain the leading term as N\to \infty of the maximal weighted N-point Riesz s-polarization (or Chebyshev constant) for a certain class of d-rectifiable compact subsets of \mathbb{R}^p. This class includes compact subsets of d-dimensional C^1 manifolds whose boundary relative to the manifold has \mathcal{H}_d-measure zero, as well as finite unions of such sets when their pairwise intersections have \mathcal{H}_d-measure zero. We also explicitly find the weak^* limit distribution of asymptotically optimal N-point polarization configurations as N\to \infty.
