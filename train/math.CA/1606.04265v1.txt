In this article, the 2-iterated q-Appell family is introduced. Certain 2-iterated q-Appell and mixed type q-special polynomials are considered as members of this family. The numbers related to these polynomials are obtained. The determinant definitions for the 2-iterated q-Appell family and for the 2-iterated and mixed type q-Appell polynomials are established. The graphs of some 2-iterated q-Appell and mixed type q-Appell polynomials are drawn for different values of indices and the roots of these polynomials are also investigated for certain values of index n by using Matlab. Finally, the approximate solutions of the real zeros of these polynomials are given.
