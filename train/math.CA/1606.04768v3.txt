In this paper, we investigate the weighted vector-valued bounds for a class of multilinear singular integral operators, and its commutators, from L^{p_1}(l^{q_1};\,\mathbb{R}^n,w_1)\times\dots\times L^{p_m}(l^{q_m};\,\mathbb{R}^n,w_m) to L^{p}(l^q;\,\mathbb{R}^n,\nu_{\vec{w}}), with p_1,\dots,p_m\in (1,\,\infty) and 1/p=1/p_1+\dots+1/p_m and \vec{w} is a multiple A_{\vec{P}} weights. Our argument also leads to the weighted weak type endpoint estimates for the commutators.
