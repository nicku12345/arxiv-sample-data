This paper is devoted to the investigation of generalized Abel equation \dot{x}=S(x,t)=\sum^m_{i=0}a_i(t)x^i, where a_i\in\mathrm C^{\infty}([0,1]). A solution x(t) is called a {\em periodic solution} if x(0)=x(1). In order to estimate the number of isolated periodic solutions of the equation, we propose a hypothesis (H) which is only concerned with S(x,t) on m straight lines: There exist m real numbers \lambda_1<\cdots<\lambda_m such that either (-1)^i\cdot S(\lambda_i,t)\geq0 for i=1,\cdots,m, or (-1)^i\cdot S(\lambda_i,t)\leq0 for i=1,\cdots,m. By means of Lagrange interpolation formula, we proves that the equation has at most m isolated periodic solutions (counted with multiplicities) if hypothesis (H) holds, and the upper bound is sharp. Furthermore, this conclusion is also obtained under some weaker geometric hypotheses.   Applying our main result for the trigonometrical generalized Abel equation with coefficients of degree one, we give a criterion to obtain the upper bound for the number of isolated periodic solutions. This criterion is "almost equivalent" to hypothesis (H) and can be much more effectively checked.
