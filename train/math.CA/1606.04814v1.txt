Let \Omega \subset \mathbb{R} be a compact set with measure 1. If there exists a subset \Lambda \subset \mathbb{R} such that the set of exponential functions E_{\Lambda}:=\{e_\lambda(x) = e^{2\pi i \lambda x}|_\Omega :\lambda \in \Lambda\} is an orthonormal basis for L^2(\Omega), then \Lambda is called a spectrum for the set \Omega. A set \Omega is said to tile \mathbb{R} if there exists a set \mathcal T such that \Omega + \mathcal T = \mathbb{R}. A conjecture of Fuglede suggests that Spectra and Tiling sets are related. Lagarias and Wang \cite {LW1} proved that Tiling sets are always periodic and are rational. That any spectrum is also a periodic set was proved in \cite {BM1}, \cite {IK}. In this paper, we give some partial results to support the rationality of the spectrum.
