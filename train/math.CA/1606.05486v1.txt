We introduce a class of "Lipschitz horizontal" vector fields in homogeneous groups, for which we show equivalent descriptions, e.g. in terms of suitable derivations. We then investigate the associated Cauchy problem, providing a uniqueness result both at equilibrium points and for vector fields of an involutive submodule of Lipschitz horizontal vector fields. We finally exhibit a counterexample to the general well-posedness theory for Lipschitz horizontal vector fields, in contrast with the Euclidean theory.
