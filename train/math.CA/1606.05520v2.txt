It is well-known that the Shannon entropies of some parameterized probability distributions are concave functions with respect to the parameter. In this paper we consider a family of such distributions (including the binomial, Poisson, and negative binomial distributions) and investigate the Shannon, R\'{e}nyi, and Tsallis entropies of them with respect to the complete monotonicity.
