In this paper we present an overview of results for discrete trigonometric and hyperbolic systems. These systems are discrete analogues of trigonometric and hyperbolic linear Hamiltonian systems. We show results which can be viewed as discrete n-dimensional extensions of scalar continuous trigonometric and hyperbolic formulas
