We consider a class of scalar delay differential equations with impulses and satisfying an Yorke-type condition, for which some criteria for the global stability of the zero solution are established. Here, the usual requirements about the impulses are relaxed.   The results can be applied to study the stability of other solutions, such as periodic solutions. As an illustration, a very general periodic Lasota-Wazewska model with impulses and multiple time-dependent delays is addressed, and the global attractivity of its positive periodic solution analysed.   Our results are discussed within the context of recent literature.
