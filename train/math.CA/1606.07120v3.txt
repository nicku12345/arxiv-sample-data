We consider the following BVP \ddot{x}\left( t\right) =f\left( t,\dot{x}\left( t\right) ,x\left( t\right) \right) -h\left( t\right) , % x\left( 0\right) =x\left( 1\right) =0, where f is continuous and satisfies some other conditions, h\in H_{0}^{1}\left( 0,1\right)  together with its discretization -\Delta^{2}x(k-1)+\frac{1}{n^{2}}f\left(\frac{k}{n}, n\Delta x\left(k-1\right), x\left(k\right)\right)=\frac{1}{n^{2}}h\left(\frac{k}{n}\right), k\in \left\{1, 2, \ldots,n \right\}. Using monotonicity methods we obtain the convergence of a solutions to a family of discrete problems to the solution of a continuous one, i.e. the existence of non-spurious solutions to the above problems is considered. Continuous dependence on parameters for the continuous problem is also investigated.
