In this paper, exact rate of approximation of functions by linear means of Fourier series and Fourier integrals and corresponding K-functionals are expressed via special moduli of smoothness. .   Introduction is given in \S 1. In \S2 functions on the line \mathbb{R} are studied. A typical (well-known) result is as follows: for each 2\pi-periodic function in L_p on the period, for any p\in[1,+\infty] (L_\infty=C) and r\in\mathbb{N}, there is a trigonometric polynomial \tau_{r,n}(f) of degree not greater than n such that \big\|f-\tau_{r,n}(f)\big\|_p\asymp\omega_r\Big(f;\frac{1}{n}\Big)_p\asymp \inf\limits_{g}\Big\{\|f-g\|_p+\frac{1}{n^r}\big\|g^{(r)}\big\|_p\Big\}, where the positive constants in these bilateral inequalities depend only on r. In \S 3 we deal with functions on \mathbb{R}^d (d\geq2), while in \S 4 with functions on Banach spaces.   The paper is partially of survey nature. The proofs are given only for Theorems 2.2, 3.9 and those in \S 4. Related open problems are formulated in \S 5.   The list of references contains 52 items.
