We consider a sequence of polynomials \{P_n\}_{n \geq 0} satisfying a special R_{II} type recurrence relation where the zeros of P_n are simple and lie on the real line. It turns out that the polynomial P_n, for any n \geq 2, is the characteristic polynomial of a simple n \times n generalized eigenvalue problem. It is shown that with this R_{II} type recurrence relation one can always associate a positive measure on the unit circle. The orthogonality property satisfied by P_n with respect to this measure is also obtained. Finally, examples are given to justify the results.
