We study approximation properties of weighted L^2-orthogonal projectors onto spaces of polynomials of bounded degree in the Euclidean unit ball, where the weight is of the generalized Gegenbauer form x \mapsto (1-\|x\|^2)^\alpha, \alpha > -1. Said properties are measured in Sobolev-type norms in which the same weighted L^2 norm is used to control all the involved weak derivatives. The method of proof does not rely on any particular basis of orthogonal polynomials, which allows for a short, streamlined and dimension-independent exposition.
