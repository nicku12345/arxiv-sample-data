Recently, Rathie and K{\i}l{\i}\c{c}man (2014) employed Kummer-type transformation for _{2}F_{2}(a, d+1; b, d; x) to develop certain classes of expansions theorems for _{2}F_{2}(x) hypergeometric polynomial. Our aim is to deduce Kummer-type transformation for _{2}F_{2}(a, d+2; b, d; x) and utilize it to develop some new expansion theorems for the confluent hypergeometric _{2}F_{2}(x) polynomial. We also obtain a well-known result given by Kim et al. (Integral Transforms Spec. Funct. 23(6); 435-444, 2012) and many other new results as particular cases of our theorems.
