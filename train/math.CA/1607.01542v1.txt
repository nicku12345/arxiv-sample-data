We present here the q-analogues of certain transformations or reduction formulae for Srivastava-Daoust type double hypergeometric series. These reduction formulae are derived by utilizing the extended Bailey's Transform developed and studied by Joshi and Vyas [Int. J. Math. Sci., (12), 2005, 1909-1927]. A number of well-known q-hypergeometric transformations are also obtained as special cases of our results.
