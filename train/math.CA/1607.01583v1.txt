We discuss the Kirchhoff-type p-Laplacian Dirichlet problem containing the left and right fractional derivative operators. By using the mountain pass theorem and the genus properties in critical point theory, we get some new results on the existence and multiplicity of nontrivial weak solutions for such Dirichlet problem.
