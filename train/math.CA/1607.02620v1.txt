We discuss L^p(\mathbb R^n) boundedness for Fourier multiplier operators that satisfy the hypotheses of the H\"ormander multiplier theorem in terms of an optimal condition that relates the distance |\frac 1p-\frac12| to the smoothness s of the associated multiplier measured in some Sobolev norm. We provide new counterexamples to justify the optimality of the condition |\frac 1p-\frac12|<\frac sn and we discuss the endpoint case |\frac 1p-\frac12|=\frac sn.
