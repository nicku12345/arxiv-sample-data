We use wavelets of tensor product type to obtain the boundedness of bilinear multiplier operators on \mathbb R^n\times \mathbb R^n associated with H\"ormander multipliers on \mathbb R^{2n} with minimal smoothness. We focus on the local L^2 case and we obtain boundedness under the minimal smoothness assumption of n/2 derivatives. We also provide counterexamples to obtain necessary conditions for all sets of indices.
