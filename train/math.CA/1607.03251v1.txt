We show that the zeros of consecutive orthogonal polynomials p_n and p_{n-1} are linearly connected by a doubly stochastic matrix for which the entries are explicitly computed in terms of Christoffel numbers. We give similar results for the zeros of p_n and the associated polynomial p_{n-1}^{(1)} and for the zeros of the polynomial obtained by deleting the kth row and column (1 \leq k \leq n) in the corresponding Jacobi matrix.
