Suppose that f belongs to a suitably defined complete metric space  {{\cal C}}^{{\alpha}} of H\"older  {\alpha}-functions defined on [0,1]. We are interested in whether one can find large (in the sense of Hausdorff, or lower/upper Minkowski dimension) sets A {\subset} [0,1] such that f|_{A} is monotone, or convex/concave. Some of our results are about generic functions in  {{\cal C}}^{{\alpha}} like the following one: we prove that for the generic f\in C_{1}^{{\alpha}}[0,1], 0\leq {\alpha}<2 for any A {\subset} [0,1] such that f|_{A} is convex, or concave we have {\mathrm{dim}}_{\mathrm H} A\leq \underline{\mathrm{dim}}_M A\leq \max \{0, {\alpha}-1 \}. On the other hand, we also have some results about all functions belonging to a certain space. For example the previous result is complemented by the following one: for 1< {\alpha}\leq 2 for any f\in C^{{\alpha}}[0,1] there is always a set A {\subset}[0,1] such that {\mathrm{dim}}_{\mathrm H} A= {\alpha}-1 and f|_{A} is convex, or concave on A.
