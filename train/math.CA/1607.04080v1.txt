It is well-known that if a real valued function acting on a convex set satisfies the n-variable Jensen inequality, for some natural number n\geq 2, then, for all k\in\{1,\dots, n\}, it fulfills the k-variable Jensen inequality as well. In other words, the arithmetic mean and the Jensen inequality (as a convexity property) are both reducible. Motivated by this phenomenon, we investigate this property concerning more general means and convexity notions. We introduce a wide class of means which generalize the well-known means for arbitrary linear spaces and enjoy a so-called reducibility property. Finally, we give a sufficient condition for the reducibility of the (M,N)-convexity property of functions and also for H\"older--Minkowski type inequalities.
