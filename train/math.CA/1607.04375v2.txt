This paper is an extension of the previous work of Chui, Filbir, and Mhaskar (Appl. Comput. Harm. Anal. 38 (3) 2015:489-509), not only from numeric data to include non-numeric data as in that paper, but also from undirected graphs to directed graphs (called digraphs, for simplicity). Besides theoretical development, this paper introduces effective mathematical tools in terms of certain data-dependent orthogonal systems for function representation and analysis directly on the digraphs. In addition, this paper also includes algorithmic development and discussion of various experimental results on such data-sets as CORA, Proposition, and Wiki-votes.
