In a previous work ([Eb]), the author proposed a method employing contiguity relations to derive hypergeometric series in closed form. In [Eb], this method was used to derive Gauss's hypergeometric series _2F_1 possessing closed forms. Here, we consider the application of this method to Appell's hypergeometetric series F_1 and derive several F_1 possessing closed forms. Moreover, analyzing these F_1, we obtain values of _2F_1 with no free parameters. Some of these results provide new examples of algebraic values of _2F_1.   Key Words and Phrases: Gauss's hypergeometric series, algebraic value, Appell's hypergeometric series, hypergeometric identity.
