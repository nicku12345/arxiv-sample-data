This paper refers to the study of generalized Struve type function. Using generalized Galue type Struve function (GTSF) by Nisar et al. [13], we derive various integral transform, including Euler transform, Laplace transform, Whittakar transform, K-transform and Fractional Fourier transform. The results are expressed in terms of generalized Wright function. The transform established here are general in nature and are likely to find useful in applied problem of Sciences, engineering and technology. Certain interesting special cases of the main results are also considered.
