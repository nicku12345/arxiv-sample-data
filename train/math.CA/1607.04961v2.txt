Schwarz triangle functions play a fundamental role in the solutions of the generalised Chazy equation. Chazy has shown that for the parameters k=2 and 3, the equations can be linearised. We determine the Schwarz triangle functions that represent the solutions in these cases. Some of these Schwarz triangle functions also show up in the dual cases where k=\frac{2}{3} and k=\frac{3}{2}, which suggests intriguing connections between the solutions for k=2 and k=3 with dihedral and tetrahedral symmetry respectively, and k=\frac{2}{3}, \frac{3}{2} with G_2 symmetry. Integrating the solutions when k=\frac{2}{3}, we obtain flat (2,3,5)-distributions parametrised algebraically by the corresponding Schwarz triangle functions. The Legendre dual of these curves are also algebraic, can be computed quite easily and are related to the integral curves of the dual generalised Chazy equation with parameter \frac{3}{2}.
