In this work, series expansions in terms of Bessel functions of the first kind are given for the sine and cosine integrals. These representations differ from many of the known Neumann-type series expansions for the sine and cosine integrals, which contain non-integer order or quadratic Bessel function terms. In addition, using the theory of Euler sums we are able to obtain some closed form evaluations of integrals involving Bessel functions and the sine and cosine integrals.
