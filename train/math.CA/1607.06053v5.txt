We observe that the linearization coefficients for ultraspherical polynomials are the orthogonality weights for Racah polynomials with special parameters. Then it turns out that the linearization sum with such a Racah polynomial as extra factor inserted, can also be evaluated. The corresponding Fourier--Racah expansion is an addition type formula which is dual to the well-known addition formula for ultraspherical polynomials. The limit to the case of Hermite polynomials of this dual addition formula is also considered. Similar results as for ultraspherical polynomials, although only formal, are given by taking the Ruijsenaars--Halln\"as dual product formula for Gegenbauer functions as a starting point and by working with Wilson polynomials.
