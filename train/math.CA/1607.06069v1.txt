We obtained exact order estimates of approximation of the classes S^{\boldsymbol{r}}_{1,\theta}B by entire functions of exponential type with supports of their Fourier transforms in step hyperbolic cross. The error of the approximation estimated in the metric of Lebesgue spaces, L_q(\mathbb{R}^d), 1<q\leqslant \infty.
