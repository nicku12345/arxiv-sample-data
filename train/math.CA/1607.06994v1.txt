Using Leray-Schauder degree or degree for \alpha-condensing maps we obtain the existence of at least one solution for the boundary value problem of the type \[ \left\{\begin{array}{lll} (\varphi(u' ))' = f(t,u,u') & & \\ u(T)=0=u'(0), & & \quad \quad \end{array}\right. \] where \varphi: X\rightarrow X  is a homeomorphism with reverse Lipschitz such that \varphi(0)=0, f:\left[0, T\right]\times X \times X \rightarrow X  is a continuous function, T a positive real number and X is a real Banach space.
