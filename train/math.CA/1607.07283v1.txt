For "Riesz-like" kernels K(x,y)=f(|x-y|) on A\times A, where A is a compact d-regular set A\subset \mathbb{R}^p, we prove a minimum principle for potentials U_K^\mu=\int K(x,y)d\mu(x), where \mu is a Borel measure supported on A. Setting P_K(\mu)=\inf_{y\in A}U^\mu(y), the K-polarization of \mu, the principle is used to show that if \{\nu_N\} is a sequence of measures on A that converges in the weak-star sense to the measure \nu, then P_K(\nu_N)\to P_K(\nu) as N\to \infty. The continuous Chebyshev (polarization) problem concerns maximizing P_K(\mu) over all probability measures \mu supported on A, while the N-point discrete Chebyshev problem maximizes P_K(\mu) only over normalized counting measures for N-point multisets on A. We prove for such kernels and sets A, that if \{\nu_N\} is a sequence of N-point measures solving the discrete problem, then every weak-star limit measure of \nu_N as N \to \infty is a solution to the continuous problem.
