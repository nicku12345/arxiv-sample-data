We derive some Euler type double integral representations for hypergeometric functions in two variables. In the first part of this paper we deal with Horn's H_2 function, in the second part with Olsson's F_P function. Our double integral representing the F_P function is compared with the formula for the same integral representing an H_2 function by M. Yoshida (Hiroshima Math. J. 10 (1980), 329-335 and M. Kita (Japan. J. Math. 18 (1992), 25-74). As specified by Kita, their integral is defined by a homological approach. We present a classical double integral version of Kita's integral, with outer integral over a Pochhammer double loop, which we can evaluate as H_2 just as Kita did for his integral. Then we show that shrinking of the double loop yields a sum of two double integrals for F_P.
