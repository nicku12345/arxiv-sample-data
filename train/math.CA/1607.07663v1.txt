The well-known curvature method initiated in works of Melnikov and Verdera is now commonly used to relate the L^2(\mu)-boundedness of certain singular integral operators to the geometric properties of the support of measure \mu, e.g. rectifiability. It can be applied however only if Menger curvature-like permutations, directly associated with the kernel of the operator, are non-negative. We give an example of an operator in the plane whose corresponding permutations change sign but the L^2(\mu)-boundedness of the operator still implies that the support of \mu is rectifiable. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first example of this type. We also obtain several related results with Ahlfors-David regularity conditions.
