Summability methods for ultraholomorphic classes in sectors, defined in terms of a strongly regular sequence \mathbb{M}=(M_p)_{p\in\mathbb{N}_0}, have been put forward by A. Lastra, S. Malek and the second author [1], and their validity depends on the possibility of associating to \mathbb{M} a nonzero proximate order. We provide several characterizations of this and other related properties, in which the concept of regular variation for functions and sequences plays a prominent role. In particular, we show how to construct well-behaved strongly regular sequences from nonzero proximate orders.   [1] A. Lastra, S. Malek and J.
