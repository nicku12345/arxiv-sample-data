For any \alpha\in(0,d), we construct Cantor sets in \mathbb{R}^d of Hausdorff dimension \alpha such that the associated natural measure \mu obeys the restriction estimate \| \widehat{f d\mu} \|_{p} \leq C_p \| f \|_{L^2(\mu)} for all p>2d/\alpha. This range is optimal except for the endpoint. This extends the earlier work of Chen-Seeger and Shmerkin-Suomala, where a similar result was obtained by different methods for \alpha=d/k with k\in\mathbb{N}. Our proof is based on the decoupling techniques of Bourgain-Demeter and a theorem of Bourgain on the existence of \Lambda(p) sets.
