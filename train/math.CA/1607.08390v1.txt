This paper presents sufficient conditions for the solvability of the third order three point boundary value problem \begin{equation*} \left\{ \begin{array}{c} -u^{\prime \prime \prime }(t)=f(t,\,v(t),\,v^{\prime }(t)) \\ -v^{\prime \prime \prime }(t)=h(t,\,u(t),\,u^{\prime }(t)) \\ u(0)=u^{\prime }(0)=0,u^{\prime }(1)=\alpha u^{\prime }(\eta ) \\ v(0)=v^{\prime }(0)=0,v^{\prime }(1)=\alpha v^{\prime }(\eta ).   \end{array}   \right. \end{equation*} The arguments apply Green's function associated to the linear problem and the Guo--Krasnosel'ski\u{\i} theorem of compression-expansion cones. The dependence on the first derivatives is overcome by the construction of an adequate cone and suitable conditions of superlinearity/sublinearity near 0 and +\infty . Last section contains an example to illustrate the applicability of the theorem.
