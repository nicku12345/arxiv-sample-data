This work is devoted to the study of the nonlinear second-order neutral difference equations with quasi-differences of the form  \Delta \left( r_{n} \Delta \left( x_{n}+q_{n}x_{n-\tau}\right)\right)= a_{n}f(x_{n-\sigma})+b_n%, \ n\geq n_0  with respect to (q_n). For q_n\to1, q_n\in(0,1) the standard fixed point approach is not sufficed to get the existence of the bounded solution, so we combine this method with an approximation technique to achieve our goal. Moreover, for p\ge 1 and \sup|q_n|<2^{1-p} using Krasnoselskii's fixed point theorem we obtain sufficient conditions of the existence of the solution which belongs to l^p space.
