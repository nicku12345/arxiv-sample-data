We show that there are functions f in the H\"older class C^{ { \alpha }}[0,1], 1< { \alpha }<2 such that f|_{A} is not convex, nor concave for any A { \subset } [0,1] with  { \bar { dim }_M } A> { \alpha }-1.   Our earlier result shows that for the typical/generic f\in { C_ { 1 } ^ { { \alpha } } [0,1] }, 0\leq { \alpha }<2 there is always a set A { \subset } [0,1] such that f|_A is convex and  { \bar { dim }_M } A=1.   The analogous statement for monotone restrictions is the following: there are functions f in the H\"older class C^{ { \alpha }}[0,1], 1/2 \leq { \alpha }<1 such that f|_{A} is not monotone on A { \subset } [0,1] with  { \bar { dim }_M } A> { \alpha }. This statement is not true for the range of parameters  { \alpha }<1/2 and our theorem for the parameter range 1\leq { \alpha } <3/2 cannot be obtained by integration of the result about monotone restrictions.
