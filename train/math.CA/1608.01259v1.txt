We recall the definition of quasinearly subharmonic functions, point out that this function class includes, among others, subharmonic functions, quasisubharmonic functions, nearly subharmonic functions and essentially almost subharmonic functions. It is shown that the sum of two quasinearly subharmonic functions may not be quasinearly subharmonic. Moreover, we characterize the harmonicity via quasinearly subharmonicity.
