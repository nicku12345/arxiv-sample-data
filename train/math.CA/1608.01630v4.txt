We obtain local boundedness and maximum principles for weak subsolutions to certain infinitely degenerate elliptic divergence form equations, and the local boundedness turns out to be sharp in more than two dimensions, answering the `Moser gap' problem left open in arXiv:1506.09203v5. Finally we obtain a maximum principle for weak solutions under the same condition on the degeneracy.
