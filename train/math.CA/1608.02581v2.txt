The least concave majorant, \hat F, of a continuous function F on a closed interval, I, is defined by \[ \hat F (x) = \inf \left\{ G(x): G \geq F, G \mbox{ concave}\right\},\; x \in I. \] We present here an algorithm, in the spirit of the Jarvis March, to approximate the least concave majorant of a differentiable piecewise polynomial function of degree at most three on I. Given any function F \in \mathcal{C}^4(I), it can be well-approximated on I by a clamped cubic spline S. We show that \hat S is then a good approximation to \hat F.   We give two examples, one to illustrate, the other to apply our algorithm.
