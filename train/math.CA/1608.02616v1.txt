Ralph Henstock (1923 - 2007), with (independently) Jaroslav Kurzweil, was the originator of the Riemann-complete or generalized Riemann integral. This material consists of four chapters of a book proposal to Cambridge University Press, which remained unpublished in the Henstock Archive at the University of Ulster. Section 5 presents a novel approach to taking limits under the integral sign, and goes on to place the traditional monotone and dominated convergence theorems of Lebesgue in this new context.
