In this paper. (1) We determine the complex-valued solutions of the following variant of Van Vleck's functional equation \int_{S}f(\sigma(y)xt)d\mu(t)-\int_{S}f(xyt)d\mu(t) = 2f(x)f(y), \;x,y\in S, where S is a semigroup, \sigma is an involutive morphism of S, and \mu is a complex measure that is linear combinations of Dirac measures (\delta_{z_{i}})_{i\in I}, such that for all i\in I, z_{i} is contained in the center of S. (2) We determine the complex-valued continuous solutions of the following variant of d'Alembert's functional equation \int_{S}f(xty)d\upsilon(t)+\int_{S}f(\sigma(y)tx)d\upsilon(t) = 2f(x)f(y), \;x,y\in S, where S is a topological semigroup, \sigma is a continuous involutive automorphism of S, and \upsilon is a complex measure with compact support and which is \sigma-invariant. (3) We prove the superstability theorems of the first functional equation.
