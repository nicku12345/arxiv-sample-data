This paper deals with the series solution of a linear delay differential equation (DDE) y'(x) = ay(x)+ by(q x), 0<q<1 with proportional delay. We discuss the convergence of this novel series. We establish the relation between the special function given in terms of this series and its differentials. We also discuss the bounds on this function and present the relation with other special functions viz. Kummer's functions, generalized Laguerre polynomials, incomplete gamma function, beta function and regularized incomplete beta function. Further, we discuss various properties and contiguous relations for the novel special function. Finally, we generalize this series by solving fractional order DDE and a system of DDE.
