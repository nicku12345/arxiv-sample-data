Tight framelets on a smooth and compact Riemannian manifold \mathcal{M} provide a tool of multiresolution analysis for data from geosciences, astrophysics, medical sciences, etc. This work investigates the construction, characterizations, and applications of tight framelets on such a manifold \mathcal{M}. Characterizations of the tightness of a sequence of framelet systems for L_{2}(\mathcal{M}) in both the continuous and semi-discrete settings are provided. Tight framelets associated with framelet filter banks on \mathcal{M} can then be easily designed and fast framelet filter bank transforms on \mathcal{M} are shown to be realizable with nearly linear computational complexity. Explicit construction of tight framelets on the sphere \mathbb{S}^{2} as well as numerical examples are given.
