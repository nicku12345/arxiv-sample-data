We establish general weighted L^2 inequalities for pseudodifferential operators associated to the H\"ormander symbol classes S^m_{\rho,\delta}. Such inequalities allow to control these operators by fractional "non-tangential" maximal functions, and subsume the optimal range of Lebesgue space bounds for pseudodifferential operators. As a corollary, several known Muckenhoupt type bounds are recovered, and new bounds for weights lying in the intersection of the Muckenhoupt and reverse H\"older classes are obtained. The proof relies on a subdyadic decomposition of the frequency space, together with applications of the Cotlar-Stein almost orthogonality principle and a quantitative version of the symbolic calculus.
