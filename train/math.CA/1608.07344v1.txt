Consider all the level sets of a real function. We can group these level sets according to their Hausdorff dimensions. We show that the Hausdorff dimension of the collection of all level sets of a given Hausdorff dimension can be arbitrarily close to 1, even if the function is differentiable to some level. By definition of Hausdorff dimension it is clear, for any real function f(x) and any \alpha \in [0,1], that \dim_{H} \left\{ {0.03in} y \ : \ \dim_{H} (f^{-1}(y)) \geq \alpha {0.03in} \right\} \leq 1. What is surprising, and what we show, is that this is actually a sharp bound. That is, \sup \left\{ {0.03in} \dim_{H} \left\{ {0.03in} y \ : \ \dim_{H} (f^{-1}(y)) = 1 {0.03in} \right\} \ : \ f \in C^{k} {0.03in} \right\} = 1, for any k \in \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 0}.
