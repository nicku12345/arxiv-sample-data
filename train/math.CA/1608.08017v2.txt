In this paper the Sumudu transforms of Hilfer-Prabhakar fractional derivative and regularized version of Hilfer-Prabhakar fractional derivative are obtained. These results are used to obtain relation between them involving Mittag- Leffler function. Also these results are applied to solve some problems in physics. Here the solutions of problems involving Hilfer-Prabhakar fractional derivative and regularized version of Hilfer-Prabhakar fractional derivative are obtained by using Fourier and Sumudu transform techniques.
