Let H be the 15- dimensional connected semisimple Lie group with its Iwasawa decomposition of H. Let G be the group of the semi direct product of H and the four dimensional real vector group . The goal of this paper is to define the Fourier transform in order to obtain the Plancherel theorem on H and so on G. Since its symplectic group of dimension 10 is a subgroup of H, then it will be easy to get the Plancherel theorem on the symplectic group and so on its inhomogeneous group. To this end, we obtain some interesting results on its nilpotent symplectic group
