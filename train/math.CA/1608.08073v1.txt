For k \ge 2 even, and  \alpha \ge -(2k+1)/4 , we provide a uniform approximation of the ultraspherical polynomials  P_k^{(\alpha,\, \alpha)}(x)  in the oscillatory region with a very explicit error term. In fact, our result covers all \alpha for which the expression "oscillatory region" makes sense. We show that there the function g(x)={c \sqrt{b(x)} \, (1-x^2)^{(\alpha+1)/2} P_k^{(\alpha, \alpha)}(x)=\cos \mathcal{B}(x)+ r(x)}, where c=c(k, \alpha) is defined by the normalization, \mathcal{B}(x)=\int_{0}^ x b(x) dx, and the functions c,\, b(x), \, \mathcal{B}(x), as well as bounds on the error term r(x) are given by some rather simple elementary functions.
