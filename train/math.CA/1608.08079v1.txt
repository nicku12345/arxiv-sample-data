It was shown recently that associated with a pair of real sequences \{\{c_{n}\}_{n=1}^{\infty}, \{d_{n}\}_{n=1}^{\infty}\}, with \{d_{n}\}_{n=1}^{\infty} a positive chain sequence, there exists a unique nontrivial probability measure \mu on the unit circle. The Verblunsky coefficients \{\alpha_{n}\}_{n=0}^{\infty} associated with the orthogonal polynomials with respect to \mu are given by the relation  \alpha_{n-1}=\overline{\tau}_{n-1}\left[\frac{1-2m_{n}-ic_{n}}{1-ic_{n}}\right], \quad n \geq 1,  where \tau_0 = 1, \tau_{n}=\prod_{k=1}^{n}(1-ic_{k})/(1+ic_{k}), n \geq 1 and \{m_{n}\}_{n=0}^{\infty} is the minimal parameter sequence of \{d_{n}\}_{n=1}^{\infty}.   In this manuscript we consider this relation and its consequences by imposing some restrictions of sign and periodicity on the sequences \{c_{n}\}_{n=1}^{\infty} and \{m_{n}\}_{n=1}^{\infty}. When the sequence    \{c_{n}\}_{n=1}^{\infty} is of alternating sign, we use information about the zeros of associated para-orthogonal polynomials to show that there is a gap in the support of the measure in the neighbourhood of z= -1. Furthermore, we show that it is possible to ge\-nerate periodic Verblunsky coefficients by choosing periodic sequences \{c_{n}\}_{n=1}^{\infty} and \{m_{n}\}_{n=1}^{\infty} with the additional restriction c_{2n}=-c_{2n-1}, \, n\geq 1. We also give some results on periodic Verblunsky coefficients from the point of view of positive chain sequences. An example is provided to illustrate the results obtained.
