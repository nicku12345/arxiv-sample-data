We study mapping properties of finite field k-plane transforms. Using geometric combinatorics, we do an elaborate analysis to recover the critical endpoint estimate. As a consequence, we obtain optimal L^p-L^r estimates for all k-plane transforms in the finite field setting. In addition, applying Holder's inequality to our results, we obtain an estimate for multilinear k-plane transforms.
