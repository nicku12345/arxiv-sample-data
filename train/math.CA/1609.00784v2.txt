In this paper, we provide a direct and constructive proof of weak factorization of h^1(\mathbb{R}) (the predual of little BMO space bmo(\mathbb{R}\times\mathbb{R}) studied by Cotlar-Sadosky and Ferguson-Sadosky), i.e., for every f\in h^1(\mathbb{R}\times\mathbb{R}) there exist sequences \{\alpha_j^k\}\in\ell^1 and functions g_j^k,h^k_j\in L^2(\mathbb{R}^2) such that \begin{align*} f=\sum_{k=1}^\infty\sum_{j=1}^\infty\alpha^k_j\Big(\, h^k_j H_1H_2 g^k_j - g^k_j H_1H_2 h^k_j\Big) \end{align*} in the sense of h^1(\mathbb{R}), where H_1 and H_2 are the Hilbert transforms on the first and second variable, respectively. Moreover, the norm \|f\|_{h^1(\mathbb{R}\times\mathbb{R})} is given in terms of \|g^k_j\|_{L^2(\mathbb{R}^2)} and \|h^k_j\|_{L^2(\mathbb{R}^2)}. By duality, this directly implies a lower bound on the norm of the commutator [b,H_1H_2] in terms of \|b\|_{{\rm bmo}(\mathbb{R}\times\mathbb{R})}.   Our method bypasses the use of analyticity and the Fourier transform, and hence can be extended to the higher dimension case in an arbitrary n-parameter setting for the Riesz transforms.
