In 2016 Prof. Fozi M. Dannan from Damascus, Syria proposed an inequality for three positive numbers with unit product. It became widely known but was not proved yet in spite of elementary formulation. We give some proofs for this inequality, a number of its generalizations and some connected unsolved problems and conjectures.
