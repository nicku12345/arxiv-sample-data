We extend the helicoidal method that we previously developed to the quasi-Banach context, proving in this way multiple Banach and quasi-Banach vector-valued inequalities for paraproducts \Pi and for the bilinear Hilbert transform BHT. As an immediate application, we obtain mixed norm estimates for \Pi \otimes \Pi in the whole range of Lebesgue exponents.   One of the novelties in the quasi-Banach framework (that is, when 0<r<1), which we expect to be useful in other contexts as well, is the "linearization" of the operator  \left( \sum_k | T(f_k, g_k) |^r \right)^{1/r} by dualizing its weak-L^p quasinorms through L^r. Another important role is played by the sharp evaluation of the operatorial norm \| T_{I_0}(f \cdot \mathbf{1}_F, g \cdot \mathbf{1}_G) \cdot \mathbf{1}_{H'}\|_r, which is obtained by dualizing the weak-L^p quasinorms through L^\tau, with \tau \leq r. In the Banach case, the linearization of the operator and the sharp estimates for the localized operatorial norm can be both achieved through the classical (generalized restricted type) L^1 dualization.
