In this paper, we study the product BMO space, little bmo space and their connections with the corresponding commutators associated with Bessel operators studied by Weinstein, Huber, and by Muckenhoupt-Stein. We first prove that the product BMO space in the Bessel setting can be used to prove the boundedness of the iterated commutators with the Bessel Riesz transforms. We next study the little \rm bmo space in this Bessel setting and obtain the equivalent characterization of this space in terms of commutators. We further show that in analogy with the classical setting, the little \rm bmo space is a proper subspace of the product \rm BMO space. These extend the previous related results studied by Cotlar-Sadosky and Ferguson-Sadosky on the bidisc to the Bessel setting.
