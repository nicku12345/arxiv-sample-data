For each  d \geq 2, the Hilbert transform with a polynomial oscillation as below satisfies a  (1, r ) sparse bound, for all  r>1  H _{ \ast } f (x) = \sup _{\epsilon } \Bigl\lvert \int_{|y| > \epsilon} f (x-y) \frac { e ^{2 \pi i y ^d }} y\; dy \Bigr\rvert.  This quickly implies weak-type inequalities for the maximal truncations, which hold for A_1 weights, but are new even in the case of Lebesgue measure. The unweighted weak-type estimate \emph{without maximal truncations} but with arbitrary polynomials, is due to Chanillo and Christ (1987).
