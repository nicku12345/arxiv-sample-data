Harmonic polynomials of type A are polynomials annihilated by the Dunkl Laplacian associated to the symmetric group acting as a reflection group on \mathbb{R}^{N}. The Dunkl operators are denoted by T_{j} for 1\leq j\leq N, and the Laplacian \Delta_{\kappa}=\sum_{j=1}^{N}T_{j}^{2}. This paper finds the homogeneous harmonic polynomials annihilated by all T_{j} for j>2. The structure constants with respect to the Gaussian and sphere inner products are computed. These harmonic polynomials are used to produce monogenic polynomials, those annihilated by a Dirac-type operator.
