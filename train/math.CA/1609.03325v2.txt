We show that if X is a uniformly perfect complete metric space satisfying the finite doubling property, then there exists a fully supported measure with lower regularity dimension as close to the lower dimension of X as we wish. Furthermore, we show that, under the condensation open set condition, the lower dimension of an inhomogeneous self-similar set E_C coincides with the lower dimension of the condensation set C, while the Assouad dimension of E_C is the maximum of the Assouad dimensions of the corresponding self-similar set E and the condensation set C. If the Assouad dimension of C is strictly smaller than the Assouad dimension of E, then the upper regularity dimension of any measure supported on E_C is strictly larger than the Assouad dimension of E_C. Surprisingly, the corresponding statement for the lower regularity dimension fails.
