Suppose that a continuous on the real axis 2\pi-periodic function f changes its convexity at 2s,\ s\in\Bbb N, points y_i on each period: -\pi\le y_{2s}<y_{2s-1}<...<y_1<\pi, and for the rest i\in\Bbb Z, the points y_i are defined periodically. In the paper, for each n\ge N, a trigonometric polynomial P_n of order cn is found such that: P_n has the same convexity as f, everywhere except, perhaps, the small neighborhoods of the y_i:  (y_i-\pi/n,y_i+\pi/n)  and  \|f-P_n\|\le c(s)\,\omega_4(f,\pi/n),  where N is a constant depending only on \min\limits_{i=1,...,2s}\{y_i-y_{i+1}\},\ c and c(s) are constants depending only on s,\ \omega_4(f,\cdot) is the modulus of continuity of the 4-th order of the function f, and \|\cdot\| is the max-norm.
