Let E= A - iB be a Hermite-Biehler entire function of exponential type \tau/2 where A and B are real entire, and consider d\mu(x) = dx/|E(x)|^2. We show that the sign of the product A B is an extremal signature for the space of functions of exponential type \tau with respect to the norm of L^1(\mu). This allows us to find best approximations by entire functions of exponential type \tau in L^1(\mu)-norm to certain special functions (e.g., the Gaussian and the Poisson kernel).
