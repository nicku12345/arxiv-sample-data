We present a generic operator J simply defined as a linear map not increasing the degree from the vectorial space of polynomial functions into itself and we address the problem of finding the polynomial sequences that coincide with the (normalized) J-image of themselves. The technique developed assembles different types of operators and initiates with a transposition of the problem to the dual space. It is also provided examples where the results are applied to the case where J's expansion is limited to three terms.
