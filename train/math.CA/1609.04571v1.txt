It is well-known that entire functions whose spectrum belongs to a fixed bounded set S admit real uniformly discrete uniqueness sets \Lambda. We show that the same is true for much wider spaces of continuous functions. In particular, Sobolev spaces have this property whenever S is a set of infinite measure having "periodic gaps". The periodicity condition is crucial. For sets S with randomly distributed gaps, we show that the uniformly discrete sets \Lambda satisfy a strong non-uniqueness property: Every discrete function c(\lambda)\in l^2(\Lambda) can be interpolated by an analytic L^2-function with spectrum in S.
