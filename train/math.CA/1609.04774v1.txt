In this paper we obtain the Hermite-Hadamard and Hermite-Hadamard-Fej\'er type inequalities for fractional integrals which generalize the two familiar fractional integrals namely, the Riemann-Liouville and the Hadamard fractional integrals into a single form. We prove that, in most cases, we obtain the Riemann--Liouville and the Hadamard equivalence just by taking limits when a parameter \rho \rightarrow 1 and \rho \rightarrow 0^+, respectively.
