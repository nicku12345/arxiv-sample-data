In this paper, we establish the sharp conditions for the inclusion relations between Besov spaces B_{p,q} and Wiener amalgam spaces W_{p,q}^s. We also obtain the optimal inclusion relations between local hardy spaces h^p and Wiener amalgam spaces W_{p,q}^s, which completely improve and extend the main results obtained by Cunanana, Kobayashib and Sugimotoa in [J. Funct. Anal. 268 (2015), 239-254]. In addition, we establish some mild characterizations of inclusion relations between Triebel-Lizorkin and Wiener amalgam spaces, which relates some modern inequalities to classical inequalities.
