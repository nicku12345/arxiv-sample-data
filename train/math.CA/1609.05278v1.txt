In this paper, we obtain the sharp conditions of the inclusion relations between modulation spaces M_{p,q}^s and Triebel-Lizorkin spaces F_{p,r} for p\leq 1, which greatly improve and extend the results for the embedding relations between local Hardy spaces and modulation spaces obtained by Kobayashi, Miyachi and Tomita in [Studia Math. 192 (2009), 79-96].
