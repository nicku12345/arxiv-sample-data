In this complementary note to [1] (arXiv:1501.05641), we provide an alternative proof for the factorial decay estimate of iterated integrals for geometric rough paths without using the neoclassical inequality. This note intends to aid the readers on the proof in [1] which works also for branched rough paths. Just as in [1], the proof here is an extension of Lyons 94' [4] from Young's integration to geometric rough paths.
