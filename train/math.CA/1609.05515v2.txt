Let E_n(f)_\mu be the error of best approximation by polynomials of degree at most n in the space L^2(\varpi_\mu, \mathbb{B}^d), where \mathbb{B}^d is the unit ball in \mathbb{R}^d and \varpi_\mu(x) = (1-\|x\|^2)^\mu for \mu > -1. Our main result shows that, for s \in \mathbb{N},  E_n(f)_\mu \le c n^{-2s}[E_{n-2s}(\Delta^s f)_{\mu+2s} + E_{n}(\Delta_0^s f)_{\mu}],  where \Delta and \Delta_0 are the Laplace and Laplace-Beltrami operators, respectively. We also derive a bound when the right hand side contains odd order derivatives.
