We consider two integrals over x\in [0,1] involving products of the function \zeta_1(a,x)\equiv \zeta(a,x)-x^{-a}, where \zeta(a,x) is the Hurwitz zeta function, given by \int_0^1\zeta_1(a,x)\zeta_1(b,x)\,dx\quad\mbox{and}\quad \int_0^1\zeta_1(a,x)\zeta_1(b,1-x)\,dx when \Re (a,b)>1. These integrals have been investigated recently in \cite{SCP}; here we provide an alternative derivation by application of Feynman parametrization. We also discuss a moment integral and the evaluation of two doubly infinite sums containing the Riemann zeta function \zeta(x) and two free parameters a and b. The limiting forms of these sums when a+b takes on integer values are considered.
