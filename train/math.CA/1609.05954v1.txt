For every integer n \geq 3, we prove that the n-sublinear generalization of the Bi-Carleson operator of Muscalu, Tao, and Thiele given by nC^{\vec{\alpha}} :(f_1,..., f_n) \mapsto \sup_{M} \left| \int_{\vec{\xi} \cdot \vec{\alpha} >0, \xi_n < M} \left[\prod_{j=1}^n \hat{f}_j(\xi_j) e^{2 \pi i x \xi_j }\right]d\vec{\xi} ~\right|satisfies no L^p estimates provided \vec{\alpha} \in \mathbb{Q}^n with distinct, non-zero entries. Furthermore, if n \geq 5 and \vec{\alpha} \in \mathbb{Q}^n has distinct, non-zero entries, it is shown that there is a symbol m:\mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{C} adapted to the hyperplane \Gamma^{\vec{a}}=\left\{ \vec{\xi} \in \mathbb{R}^n: \sum_{j=1}^n \xi_j \cdot a_j =0 \right\}  and supported in \left\{ \vec{\xi} : dist(\vec{\xi}, \Gamma^{\vec{\alpha}}) \lesssim 1 \right\} for which the associated n-linear multiplier also satisfies no L^p estimates. Next, we construct a H\"{o}rmander-Marcinkiewicz symbol \Pi: \mathbb{R}^2 \rightarrow \mathbb{C}, which is a paraproduct of (\phi, \psi) type, such that the trilinear operator T_m whose symbol m is  sgn(\xi_1 + \xi_2) \Pi(\xi_2, \xi_3) satisfies no L^p estimates. Finally, we state a converse to a theorem of Muscalu, Tao, and Thiele using Riesz kernels in the spirit of Muscalu's recent work: for every pair of integers (\mathfrak{d},n)  s.t.  \frac{n}{2}+\frac{3}{2} \leq \mathfrak{d}<n there is an explicit collection \mathfrak{C} of uncountably many \mathfrak{d}-dimensional non-degenerate subspaces of \mathbb{R}^n such that for each \Gamma \in \mathcal{C} there is an associated symbol m_\Gamma adapted to \Gamma in the Mikhlin-H\"{o}rmander sense and supported in \left\{ \vec{\xi} : dist(\vec{\xi}, \Gamma) \lesssim 1 \right\} for which the associated multilinear multiplier T_{m_\Gamma} is unbounded.
