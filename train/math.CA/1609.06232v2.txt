In this work, several sharp bounds for the \v{C}eby\v{s}ev functional involving various type of functions are proved. In particular, for the \v{C}eby\v{s}ev functional of two absolutely continuous functions whose first derivatives are both convex, convex and belong to L_p-spaces, convex and bounded variation, convex and Lipschitz mappings new sharp bounds are presented. Other related results regarding two convex and concave functions are given.
