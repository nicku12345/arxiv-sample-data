Let  T_{P } f (x) = \int e ^{i P (y)} K (y) f (x-y) \; dy , where  K (y) is a smooth Calder\'on-Zygmund kernel on  \mathbb R ^{n}, and  P be a polynomial. We show that there is a sparse bound for the bilinear form  \langle T_P f, g \rangle. This in turn easily implies  A_p  inequalities. The method of proof is applied in a random discrete setting, yielding the first weighted inequalities for operators defined on sparse sets of integers.
