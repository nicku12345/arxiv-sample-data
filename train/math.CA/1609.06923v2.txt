We obtain mixed A_p--A_\infty estimates for a large family of multilinear maximal and sparse operators. Operators from this family are known to control for instance multilinear Calder\'on--Zygmund operators, square functions, fractional integrals, and the bilinear Hilbert transform. Our results feature a new multilinear version of the Fujii--Wilson A_\infty characteristic that allows us to recover the best known estimates in terms of the A_p characteristic for dependent weights as a special case of the mixed characteristic estimates for general tuples of weights.
