Suppose L=-\Delta+V is a Schr\"odinger operator on \mathbb{R}^n with a potential V belonging to certain reverse H\"older class RH_\sigma with \sigma\geq n/2. The aim of this paper is to study the A_p weights associated to L, denoted by A_p^L, which is a larger class than the classical Muckenhoupt A_p weights. We first establish the "exp--log" link between A_p^L and BMO_L (the BMO space associated with L), which is the first extension of the classical result to a setting beyond the Laplace operator. Second, we prove the quantitative A_p^L bound for the maximal function and the maximal heat semigroup associated to L. Then we further provide the quantitative A_{p,q}^L bound for the fractional integral operator associated to L. We point out that all these quantitative bounds are known before in terms of the classical A_{p,q} constant. However, since A_{p,q}\subset A_{p,q}^L, the A_{p,q}^L constants are smaller than A_{p,q} constant. Hence, our results here provide a better quantitative constant for maximal functions and fractional integral operators associated to L.
