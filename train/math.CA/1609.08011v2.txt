We study the multiplicity of positive solutions of the critical elliptic equation:  \Delta_{\mathbb{S}^3} U = -(U^5 +\lambda U) \hspace{0.3cm}\hbox{ on } \Omega that vanish on the boundary of \Omega, where \Omega is a region of \mathbb{S}^3 which is invariant by the natural \mathbb{T}^2-action. H. Brezis and L. A. Peletier consider the case in which \Omega is invariant by the SO(3)-action, namely, when \Omega is a spherical cap. We show that the number of solutions increases as \lambda \to -\infty, giving an answer of a particular case of an open problem proposed by H. Brezis and L. A. Peletier.
