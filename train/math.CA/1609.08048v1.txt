The present paper is devoted to the study of the maximum number of limit cycles bifurcated from the periodic orbits of the quadratic isochronous center \dot{x}=-y+\frac{16}{3}x^{2}-\frac{4}{3}y^{2},\dot{y}=x+\frac{8}{3}xy by the averaging method of first order, when it is perturbed inside a class of discontinuous quadratic polynomial differential systems. The \emph{Chebyshev criterion} is used to show that this maximum number is 5 and can be realizable. The result and that in paper \cite{LC} completely answer the questions left in the paper \cite{LM}.
