The weak boundedness property associated with a standard alpha-fractional Calderon-Zygmund operator and a weight pair is good-lambda controlled by the testing conditions and the Muckenhoupt and energy side conditions. As a consequence, assuming the side conditions, we can eliminate the weak boundedness property from Theorem 1 of arXiv:1603.04332v2 to obtain that T is bounded if and only if the testing conditions hold for T and its dual (an earlier instance of this type of conclusion appears in Lacey and Wick arXiv:1312.6163v3). As a corollary we give a simple derivation of a two weight accretive global Tb theorem from a related T1 theorem. The role of two different parameterizations of the family of dyadic grids, by scale and by translation, is highlighted in simultaneously exploiting both goodness and NTV surgery with families of grids that are common to both measures.
