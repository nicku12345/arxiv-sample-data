We obtain the asymptotic expansion for the Gauss hypergeometric function \[F(a-\lambda,b+\lambda;c+i\alpha\lambda;z)\] for \lambda\rightarrow+\infty with a, b and c finite parameters by application of the method of steepest descents. The quantity \alpha is real, so that the denominatorial parameter is complex and z is a finite complex variable restricted to lie in the sector |\arg (1-z)|<\pi. We concentrate on the particular case a=0, b=c=1, which is associated with the Legendre functions of real degree and imaginary order. The resulting expansions are of Poincar\'e type and hold in restricted domains of the z-plane. An expansion is given at the coalescence of two saddle points. Numerical results illustrating the accuracy of the different expansions are given.
