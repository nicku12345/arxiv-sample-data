We study discrete random variants of the Carleson maximal operator. Intriguingly, these questions remain subtle and difficult, even in this setting. Let \{X_m\} be an independent sequence of \{0,1\} random variables with expectations \[ \mathbb E X_m = \sigma_m = m^{-\alpha}, \ 0 < \alpha < 1/2, \] and  S_m = \sum_{k=1} ^{m} X_k. Then the maximal operator below almost surely is bounded from  \ell ^{p} to  \ell ^{p}, provided the Minkowski dimension of  \Lambda \subset [-1/2, 1/2] is strictly less than  1- \alpha . \[ \sup_{\lambda \in \Lambda } \Bigl| \sum_{m\neq 0} X_{\lvert m\rvert } \frac{e( \lambda m )}{ {\rm sgn} (m)S_{ |m| }} f(x- m) \Bigr|. \] This operator also satisfies a sparse type bound. The form of the sparse bound immediately implies weighted estimates in all  \ell ^{2}, which are novel in this setting. Variants and extensions are also considered.
