In this paper, we consider the monotonicity of certain combinations of the Gaussian hypergeometric functions F(a-1,b;a+b;1-x^c) and F(a-1-\delta,b+\delta;a+b;1-x^d) on (0,1) for \delta\in(a-1,0), and study the problem of comparing these two functions, thus get the largest value \delta_1=\delta_1(a,c,d) such that the inequality F(a-1,b;a+b;1-x^c)<F(a-1-\delta,b+\delta;a+b;1-x^d) holds for all x\in (0,1).
