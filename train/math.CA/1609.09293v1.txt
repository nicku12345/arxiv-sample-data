In our previous papers, we have introduced within the theory of the Riemann zeta function the following notions: Jacob's ladders, oscillating systems, \zeta-factorization, metamorphoses, \dots In this paper we obtain \zeta-analogue of an elementary trigonometric identity and other interactions between oscillating systems.
