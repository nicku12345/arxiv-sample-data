In this paper we establish sharp estimates (up to logarithmic losses) for the multilinear oscillatory integral operator studied by Phong, Stein, and Sturm and Carbery and Wright on any product \prod_{j=1}^d L^{p_j}(\mathbb R) with each p_j \geq 2, expanding the known results for this operator well outside the previous range \sum_{j=1}^d p_j^{-1} = d-1. Our theorem assumes second-order nondegeneracy condition of Varchenko type, and as a corollary reproduces Varchenko's theorem and implies Fourier decay estimates for measures of smooth density on degenerate hypersurfaces in \mathbb R^d.
