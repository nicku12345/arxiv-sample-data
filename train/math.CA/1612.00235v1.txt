Let \ell>0 be arbitrary. We introduce the extremal quantities  G(\ell):=\frac{\sup_{f} \int_{-\ell}^{\ell} f\,dx}{\int_{-1}^1 f\,dx},\quad C(\ell):=\frac{\sup_{f} \sup_{a\in {\mathbb R}} \int_{a-\ell}^{a+\ell} f\,dx}{\int_{-1}^1 f\,dx},  where the supremum is taken over all not identically zero non-negative positive definite functions. We are interested in the question: how large can the above extremal quantities be?   This problem was originally posed by Yu. Shteinikov and S. Konyagin for the case \ell=2. In this note we obtain exact values for the right limits G(k+0) and C(k+0) at natural numbers k, and sufficiently close bounds for other values of \ell. We point out that the problem provides an extension of the classical problem of Wiener.
