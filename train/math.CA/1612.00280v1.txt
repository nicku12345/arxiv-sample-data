We consider abstract Sobolev spaces of Bessel-type associated with an operator. In this work, we pursue the study of algebra properties of such functional spaces through the corresponding semigroup. As a follow-up of [4], we show that under the extra property of a "carr\'e du champ identity" , this algebra property holds in a wider range than previously shown.
