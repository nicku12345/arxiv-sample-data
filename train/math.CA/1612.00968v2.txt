Let M be the Hardy-Littlewood maximal function and b be a locally integrable function. Denote by M_b and [b,M] the maximal commutator and the (nonlinear) commutator of M with b. In this paper, the author consider the boundedness of M_b and [b,M] on Lebesgue spaces and Morrey spaces when b belongs to the Lipschitz space, by which some new characterizations of the Lipschitz spaces are given.
