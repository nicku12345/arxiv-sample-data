For each irreducible module of the symmetric group \mathcal{S}_{N} there is a set of parametrized nonsymmetric Jack polynomials in N variables taking values in the module. These polynomials are simultaneous eigenfunctions of a commutative set of operators, self-adjoint with respect to two Hermitian forms, one called the contravariant form and the other is with respect to a matrix-valued measure on the N-torus. The latter is valid for the parameter lying in an interval about zero which depends on the module. The author in a previous paper [SIGMA 12 (2016), 033, 27 pages, arXiv:1511.06721] proved the existence of the measure and that its absolutely continuous part satisfies a system of linear differential equations. In this paper the system is analyzed in detail. The N-torus is divided into (N-1)! connected components by the hyperplanes x_{i}=x_{j}, i<j, which are the singularities of the system. The main result is that the orthogonality measure has no singular part with respect to Haar measure, and thus is given by a matrix function times Haar measure. This function is analytic on each of the connected components.
