Motivated by analytic number theory, we explore remainder versions of Ikehara's Tauberian theorem yielding power law remainder terms. More precisely, for f:[1,\infty)\rightarrow{\mathbb R} non-negative and non-decreasing we prove f(x)-x=O(x^\gamma) with \gamma<1 under certain assumptions on f. We state a conjecture concerning the weakest natural assumptions and show that we cannot hope for more.
