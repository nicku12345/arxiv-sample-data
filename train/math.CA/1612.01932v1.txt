We present reverse H\"older inequalities for Muckenhoupt weights in \mathbb{R}^n with an asymptotically sharp behavior for flat weights, namely A_\infty weights with Fujii-Wilson constant (w)_{A_\infty}\to 1^+. That is, the local integrability exponent in the reverse H\"older inequality blows up as the weight becomes nearly constant. This is expressed in a precise and explicit computation of the constants involved in the reverse H\"older inequality. The proofs avoid BMO methods and rely instead on precise covering arguments. Furthermore, in the one-dimensional case we prove sharp reverse H\"older inequalities for one-sided and two sided weights in the sense that both the integrability exponent as well as the multiplicative constant appearing in the estimate are best possible. We also prove sharp endpoint weak-type reverse H\"older inequalities and consider further extensions to general non-doubling measures and multiparameter weights.
