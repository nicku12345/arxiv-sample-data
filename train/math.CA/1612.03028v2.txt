Due to its nonlocal nature, the r-variation norm Carleson operator C_r does not yield to the sparse domination techniques of Lerner, Di Plinio and Lerner, Lacey. We overcome this difficulty and prove that the dual form to C_r can be dominated by a positive sparse form involving L^p averages. Our result strengthens the L^p estimates by Oberlin et. al. As a corollary, we obtain quantitative weighted norm inequalities improving on previous results by Do and Lacey. Our proof relies on the localized outer L^p-embeddings of Di Plinio-Ou and Uraltsev.
