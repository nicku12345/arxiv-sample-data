Fractional kinetic equations are investigated in order to describe the various phenomena governed by anomalous reaction in dynamical systems with chaotic motion. Many authors have provided solutions for various families of fractional kinetic equations involving special functions. Here, in this paper, we aim at presenting solutions of certain general families of fractional kinetic equations associated with the generalized modified k-Bessel function of the first kind. It is also pointed out that the main results presented here are general enough to be able to be specialized to yield many known and (presumably) new solutions for fractional kinetic equations.
