In this present paper our aim is to deal with two integral transforms which involving the Gauss hypergeometric function as its kernels. We prove some compositions formulas for such a generalized fractional integrals with k Bessel function. The results are established in terms of generalized Wright type hypergeometric function and generalized hypergeometric series. Also, the authors presented some corresponding assertions for Riemann Liouville and Erdelyi Kober fractional integral transforms.
