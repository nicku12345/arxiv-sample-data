Let G be a topological group. We investigate relations between two classes of "polynomial like" continuous functions on G defined, respectively, by the conditions (1) \Delta_h^{n+1}f=0 for every h \in G, and (2) \Delta_{h_{n+1}} \Delta_{h_{n}}\cdots \Delta_{h_{1}}f=0, for every h_1,\cdots, h_{n+1} \in G. It is shown that for many (but not all) groups these classes coincide. We consider also Montel type versions of the above conditions - when (1) and (2) hold only for steps h in a generating subset of G. Our approach is based on the study of the counterparts of the discussed classes for general representations of groups (instead of the regular representation).
