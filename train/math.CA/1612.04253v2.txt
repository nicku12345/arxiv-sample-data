We model the dynamical behavior of a three dimensional (3-D) dissipative oscillator consisting of a m-block whose vertical fall occurs against a spring and which can also slide horizontally on a rigid truss rotating at a known angular speed law \omega(t). The z-vertical time law is obvious, whilst its x-motion along the horizontal arm is ruled by a linear differential equation to be solved through the Hermite functions and the Confluent Hypergeometric Function (CHF) _{1}F_{1} (Kummer). After the rotation time law \theta(t) has been computed, we know completely the mass motion in a cylindrical coordinate reference: some transients have then been discussed. Finally, further effects as an inclined slide and a contact dry friction have been added to the problem, so that the motion differential equation becomes inhomogeneous and we resort to Lagrange method of variation of constants, helped by a Fourier-Bessel expansion, in order to manage the relevant intractable integrations.
