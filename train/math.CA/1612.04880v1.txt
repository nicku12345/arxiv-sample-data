Fourier restriction theorems, whose study had been initiated by E.M. Stein, usually describe a family of a priori estimates of the L^q-norm of the restriction of the Fourier transform of a function f in L^p (say, on Euclidean space) to a given subvariety S, endowed with a suitabel measure. Such estimates allow to define the restriction Rf of the Fourier transform of an L^p-function to S in an operator theoretic sense. In this article, we begin to investigate the question what is the "intrinsic" pointwise relation between Rf and the Fourier transform of f, by looking at curves in the plane, for instance with non-vanishing curvature. To this end, we bound suitable maximal operators, including the Hardy-Littlewood maximal function of the Fourier transform of f restricted to S.
