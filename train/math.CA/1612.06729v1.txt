We find t-designs on compact algebraic manifolds with a number of points comparable to the dimension of the space of polynomials of degree t on the manifold. This generalizes results on the sphere by Bondarenko, Radchenko and Viazovska. Of special interest is the particular case of the Grassmannians where our results improve the bounds that had been proved previously.
