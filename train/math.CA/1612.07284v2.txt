We use Andrews' q-analogues of Watson's and Whipple's _3F_2 summation theorems to deduce two formulas for products of specific basic hypergeometric functions. These constitute q-analogues of corresponding product formulas for ordinary hypergeometric functions given by Bailey. The first formula was obtained earlier by Jain and Srivastava by a different method.
