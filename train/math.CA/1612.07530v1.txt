Given a finite set F=\{f_1,\cdots ,f_k\} of nonnegative integers (written in increasing size) and a classical discrete family (p_n)_n of orthogonal polynomials (Charlier, Meixner, Krawtchouk or Hahn), we consider the Casorati determinant \det(p_{f_i}(x+j-1))_{i,j=1,\cdots,k}. In this paper we prove a nice invariant property for this kind of Casorati determinants when the set F is changed by I(F)=\{0,1,2,\cdots,\max F\}\setminus \{\max F-f:f\in F\}. This symmetry is related to the existence of higher order difference equations for the orthogonal polynomials with respect to certain Christoffel transforms of the classical discrete measures. By passing to the limit, this invariant property is extended for Wronskian type determinants whose entries are Hermite, Laguerre and Jacobi polynomials.
