In this article we consider certain types of weighted generalized functions associated with nondegenerate quadratic forms. Such functions and their derivatives are used for constructing fundamental solutions of iterated ultra-hyperbolic equations with Bessel operator and for constructing negative real powers of ultra-hyperbolic operators with Bessel operator.
