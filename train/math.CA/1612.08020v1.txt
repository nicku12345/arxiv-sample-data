Several new inequalities for moduli of smoothness and errors of the best approximation of a function and its derivatives in the spaces L_p, 0<p<1, are obtained. For example, it is shown that for any 0<p<1 and k,\,r\in \mathbb{N} one has    \omega_{r+k}(f,\d)_p\leq C({p,k,r})\d^{r+\frac{1}{p}-1}\(\int_0^\d\frac{\omega_{k}(f^{(r)},t)_p^p}{t^{2-p}}{\rm d}t\)^\frac{1}{p}, where the function f is such that f^{(r-1)} is absolutely continuous. Similar inequalities are obtained for the Ditzian-Totik moduli of smoothness and the error of the best approximation of functions by trigonometric and algebraic polynomials and splines. As an application, positive results about simultaneous approximation of a function and its derivatives by the mentioned approximation methods in the spaces L_p, 0<p<1, are derived.
