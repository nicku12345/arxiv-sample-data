For certain families of functions \{f_q\} mapping K^{nv_q} \to K^m, where K is a complete, nonarchimedean local field, we find a set E of large Hausdorff dimension with the property that f_q(x_1, \ldots, x_{v_q}) is nonzero for any distinct points x_1, \ldots, x_{v_q} \in E. In particular, this result can be applied to show that the ring of integers of any local field contains a subset of Hausdorff dimension 1 not containing any nondegenerate 3-term arithmetic progressions.
