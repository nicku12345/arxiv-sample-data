Although being powerful, the differential transform method yet suffers from a drawback which is how to compute the differential transform of nonlinear non-autonomous functions that can limit its applicability. In order to overcome this defect, we introduce in this paper a new general formula and its related recurrence relations for computing the differential transform of any analytic nonlinear non-autonomous function with one or multi-variable. Regarding, the formula in the literature was found not applicable to deal with the present non-autonomous functions. Accordingly, a generalization is presented in this paper which reduces to the corresponding formula in the literature as a special case. Several test examples for different types of nonlinear differential and integro-differential equations are solved to demonstrate the validity and applicability of the present method. The obtained results declare that the suggested approach not only effective but also a straight forward even in solving differential and integro-differential equations with complex nonlinearities.
