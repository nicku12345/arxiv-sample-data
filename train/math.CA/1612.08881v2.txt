Consider the discrete cubic Hilbert transform defined on finitely supported functions f on \mathbb{Z} by   \begin{eqnarray*}   H_3f(n) = \sum_{m \not = 0} \frac{f(n- m^3)}{m}.   \end{eqnarray*} We prove that there exists r <2 and universal constant C such that for all finitely supported f,g on \mathbb{Z} there exists an (r,r)-sparse form {\Lambda}_{r,r} for which   \begin{eqnarray*} \left| \langle H_3f, g \rangle \right| \leq C {\Lambda}_{r,r} (f,g).   \end{eqnarray*} This is the first result of this type concerning discrete harmonic analytic operators. It immediately implies some weighted inequalities, which are also new in this setting.
