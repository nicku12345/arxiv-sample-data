We prove that bilinear forms associated to the rough homogeneous singular integrals T_\Omega on \mathbb R^d, where the angular part \Omega \in L^q (S^{d-1}) has vanishing average and 1<q\leq \infty, and to Bochner-Riesz means at the critical index in \mathbb R^d are dominated by sparse forms involving (1,p) averages. This domination is stronger than the weak-L^1 estimates for T_\Omega and for Bochner-Riesz means, respectively due to Seeger and Christ. Furthermore, our domination theorems entail as a corollary new sharp quantitative A_p-weighted estimates for Bochner-Riesz means and for homogeneous singular integrals with unbounded angular part, extending previous results of Hyt\"onen-Roncal-Tapiola for T_\Omega. Our results follow from a new abstract sparse domination principle which does not rely on weak endpoint estimates for maximal truncations.
