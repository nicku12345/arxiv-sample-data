In the present article the moments associated with the Jain basis functions are developed to order ten. The moments are shown to be polynomials in one variable with polynomial coefficients. The polynomial coefficients are investigated and shown to be linked to sequences found in the On-line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences.
