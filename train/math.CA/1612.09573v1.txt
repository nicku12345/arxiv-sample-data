In this note we give an alternative proof of a theorem due to Bourgain \cite{Bourgain} concerning the growth of the constant in the Littlewood-Paley inequality on \mathbb{T} as p \rightarrow 1^+. Our argument is based on the endpoint mapping properties of Marcinkiewicz multiplier operators, obtained by Tao and Wright in \cite{TW}, and on Tao's converse extrapolation theorem \cite{Tao}. Our method also establishes the growth of the constant in the Littlewood-Paley inequality on \mathbb{T}^n as p \rightarrow 1^+. Furthermore, we obtain sharp weak-type inequalities for the Littlewood-Paley square function on \mathbb{T}^n, but when n \geq 2 the weak-type endpoint estimate on the product Hardy space over the n-torus fails, contrary to what happens when n=1.
