For Riesz s-potentials K(x,y)=|x-y|^{-s}, s>0, we investigate separation and covering properties of N-point configurations \omega^*_N=\{x_1, \ldots, x_N\} on a d-dimensional compact set A\subset \mathbb{R}^\ell for which the minimum of \sum_{j=1}^N K(x, x_j) is maximal. Such configurations are called N-point optimal Riesz s-polarization (or Chebyshev) configurations. For a large class of d-dimensional sets A we show that for s>d the configurations \omega^*_N have the optimal order of covering. Furthermore, for these sets we investigate the asymptotics as N\to \infty of the best covering constant. For these purposes we compare best-covering configurations with optimal Riesz s-polarization configurations and determine the s-th root asymptotic behavior (as s\to \infty) of the maximal s-polarization constants. In addition, we introduce the notion of "weak separation" for point configurations and prove this property for optimal Riesz s-polarization configurations on A for s>\text{dim}(A), and for d-1\leqslant s < d on the sphere \mathbb{S}^d.
