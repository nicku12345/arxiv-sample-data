This is the last part of a series of three papers entitled "Four-dimensional Painlev\'e-type equations associated with ramified linear equations". In this series of papers we aim to construct the complete degeneration scheme of four-dimensional Painlev\'e-type equations. In the present paper, we consider the degeneration of the Garnier system in two variables and the Fuji-Suzuki system.
