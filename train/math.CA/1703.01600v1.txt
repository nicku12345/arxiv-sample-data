In this paper, we study the L^p boundedness of a class of oscillating multiplier operator for the Dunkl transform, T_{m_\alpha}=\mathcal{F}_k^{-1}(m_{\alpha}\mathcal{F}_k(f)) with m(\xi)=|\xi|^{-\alpha}e^{\pm i|\xi|}\phi(\xi). We obtain an L^p-bound result for the corresponding maximal functions. As a specific applications, we give an extension of the L^p estimate for the wave equation and of Stein's theorem for the analytic family of maximal spherical means \cite{Stein}
