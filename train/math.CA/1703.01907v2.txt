The non-elementary integrals \text{Si}_{\beta,\alpha}=\int [\sin{(\lambda x^\beta)}/(\lambda x^\alpha)] dx,\beta\ge1,\alpha\le\beta+1 and \text{Ci}_{\beta,\alpha}=\int [\cos{(\lambda x^\beta)}/(\lambda x^\alpha)] dx, \beta\ge1, \alpha\le2\beta+1, where \{\beta,\alpha\}\in\mathbb{R}, are evaluated in terms of the hypergeometric functions _{1}F_2 and _{2}F_3, and their asymptotic expressions for |x|\gg1 are also derived. The integrals of the form \int [\sin^n{(\lambda x^\beta)}/(\lambda x^\alpha)] dx and \int [\cos^n{(\lambda x^\beta)}/(\lambda x^\alpha)] dx, where n is a positive integer, are expressed in terms \text{Si}_{\beta,\alpha} and \text{Ci}_{\beta,\alpha}, and then evaluated. \text{Si}_{\beta,\alpha} and \text{Ci}_{\beta,\alpha} are also evaluated in terms of the hypergeometric function _{2}F_2. And so, the hypergeometric functions, _{1}F_2 and _{2}F_3, are expressed in terms of _{2}F_2.The exponential integral \text{Ei}_{\beta,\alpha}=\int (e^{\lambda x^\beta}/x^\alpha) dx where \beta\ge1 and \alpha\le\beta+1 and the logarithmic integral \text{Li}=\int_{\mu}^{x} dt/\ln{t}, \mu>1 are also expressed in terms of _{2}F_2, and their asymptotic expressions are investigated. It is found that for x\gg\mu, \text{Li}\sim {x}/{\ln{x}}+\ln{\left(\frac{\ln{x}}{\ln{\mu}}\right)}-2-\ln{\mu}\hspace{.075cm} _{2}F_{2}(1,1;2,2;\ln{\mu}), where the term \ln{\left(\frac{\ln{x}}{\ln{\mu}}\right)}-2-\ln{\mu}\hspace{.075cm} _{2}F_{2}(1,1;2,2;\ln{\mu}) is added to the known expression in mathematical literature \text{Li}\sim {x}/{\ln{x}}.
