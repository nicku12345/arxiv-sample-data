This paper presents a new technique to investigate the existence of solutions to fractional three-point boundary value problems at resonance in a Hilbert space. Based on the proposed method, the restricted conditions A^2\xi^{2\alpha-2}=A\xi^{\alpha-1} and A^2\xi^{2\alpha-2}=I on the operator A, which have been used in \cite{Zhou2}, are removed. It is shown that the system under consideration admits at least one solution by applying coincidence degree theory. Finally, an illustrative example is presented.
