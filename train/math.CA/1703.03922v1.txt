In this paper we establish some (presumably new) interesting expressions for the composition of some well known fractional integral operators  I^{\mu}_{a+}, D^{\mu}_{a+} , I^{\gamma , \mu}_{a+} and also derive an integral operator \mathcal{H}^{w;m,n;\alpha}_{a+;p,q;\beta} whose kernel involve the Fox's H- function. By suitably specializing the coefficients and the parameters in these functions we can get a large number of (new and known) interesting expressions for the composition formulae which occur rather frequently in many problems of engineering and mathematical analysis but here we can mention only those which follow as particular cases of the Srivastava et al.\cite{ZT}.
