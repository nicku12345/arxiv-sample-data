Let (X, \mathscr{L}, \lambda) and (Y, \mathscr{M}, \mu) be finite measure spaces for which there exist A \in \mathscr{L} and B \in \mathscr{M} with 0 < \lambda(A) < \lambda(X) and 0 < \mu(B) < \mu(Y), and let I\subseteq \mathbf{R} be a non-empty interval. We prove that, if f and g are continuous bijections I \to \mathbf{R}^+, then the equation  f^{-1}\!\left(\int_X f\!\left(g^{-1}\!\left(\int_Y g \circ h\;d\mu\right)\right)d \lambda\right)\! = g^{-1}\!\left(\int_Y g\!\left(f^{-1}\!\left(\int_X f \circ h\;d\lambda\right)\right)d \mu\right) is satisfied by every \mathscr{L} \otimes \mathscr{M}-measurable simple function h: X \times Y \to I if and only if f=c g for some c \in \mathbf{R}^+ (it is easy to see that the equation is well posed). An analogous, but essentially different, result, with f and g replaced by continuous injections I \to \mathbf R and \lambda(X)=\mu(Y)=1, was recently obtained in [Indag. Math. 27 (2016), 945-953].
