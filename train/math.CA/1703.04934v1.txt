In this paper, we present an extension of Mittag-Leffler function by using the extension of beta functions (\"{O}zergin et al. in J. Comput. Appl. Math. 235 (2011), 4601-4610) and obtain some integral representation of this newly defined function. Also, we present the Mellin transform of this function in terms of Wright hypergeometric function. Furthermore, we show that the extended fractional derivative of the usual Mittag-Leffler function gives the extension of Mittag-Leffler function.
