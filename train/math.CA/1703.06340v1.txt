We consider the spherical mean generated by a multidimensional generalized translation and general Euler-Poisson-Darboux equation corresponding to this mean. The Asgeirsson property of solutions of the ultrahyperbolic equation that includes singular differential Bessel operators acting by each variable is provided.
