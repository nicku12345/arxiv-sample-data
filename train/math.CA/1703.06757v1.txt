Dawson's integral and related functions in mathematical physics that include the complex error function (Faddeeva's integral), Fried-Conte (plasma dispersion) function, (Jackson) function, Fresnel function and Gordeyev's integral are analytically evaluated in terms of the confluent hypergeometric function.And hence, the asymptotic expansions of these functions on the complex plane \mathbb{C} are derived using the asymptotic expansion of the confluent hypergeometric function.
