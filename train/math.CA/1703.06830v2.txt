We prove that the spherical mean value of the Dunkl-type generalized translation operator \tau^y is a positive L^p-bounded generalized translation operator T^t. As application, we prove the Young inequality for a convolution defined by T^t, the L^p-boundedness of \tau^y on a radial functions for p>2, the L^p-boundedness of the Riesz potential for the Dunkl transform and direct and inverse theorems of approximation theory in L^p-spaces with the Dunkl weight.
