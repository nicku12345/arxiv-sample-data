The Lambert W function was introduced by Euler in 1779, but was not well-known until it was implemented in Maple, and the seminal paper of Corless, Gonnet, Hare, Jeffrey and Khuth was published in 1996. In this note we describe a simple problem, which can be straightforwardly solved in terms of the W function.
