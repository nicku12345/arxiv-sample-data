We extend to a situation involving matrix valued orthogonal polynomials a scalar result that originates in work of Claude Shannon and a ground-breaking series of papers by D. Slepian, H. Landau and H. Pollak at Bell Labs in the 1960's. While these papers feature integral and differential operators acting on scalar valued functions, we are dealing here with integral and differential operators acting on matrix valued functions.
