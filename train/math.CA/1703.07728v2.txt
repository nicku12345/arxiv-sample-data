A few years ago, Bourgain proved that the centered Hardy-Littlewood maximal function for the cube has dimension free L^p-bounds for p>1. We extend his result to products of Euclidean balls of different dimensions. In addition, we provide dimension free L^p-bounds for the maximal function associated to products of Euclidean spheres for p > \frac{N}{N-1} and N \ge 3, where N-1 is the lowest occurring dimension of a single sphere. The aforementioned result is obtained from the latter one by applying the method of rotations from Stein's pioneering work on the spherical maximal function.
