We present a transference principle of Lebesgue mixed norm estimates for Bergman projectors from tube domains over homogeneous cones to homogeneous Siegel domains of type II associated to the same cones. This principle implies improvements of these estimates for homogeneous Siegel domains of type II associated with Lorentz cones, e.g. the Pyateckii-Shapiro Siegel domain of type II.
