Any three basic hypergeometric series {}_{2}phi_{1} whose respective parameters (a, b, c) differ by integer powers of the base q satisfy a linear relation with coefficients which are rational functions of a, b, c, q and the variable x. These relations are called three term relations for the basic hypergeometric series {}_{2}phi_{1}. This paper gives explicit expressions for the coefficients of these three term relations.
