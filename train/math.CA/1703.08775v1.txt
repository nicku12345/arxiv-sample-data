Consider the discrete quadratic phase Hilbert Transform acting on \ell^{2} finitely supported functions  H^{\alpha} f(n) : = \sum_{m \neq 0} \frac{e^{2 \pi i\alpha m^2} f(n - m)}{m}.  We prove that, uniformly in \alpha \in \mathbb{T}, there is a sparse bound for the bilinear form \langle H^{\alpha} f , g \rangle. The sparse bound implies several mapping properties such as weighted inequalities in an intersection of Muckenhoupt and reverse H\"older classes.
