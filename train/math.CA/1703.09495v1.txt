We prove a maximal Fourier restriction theorem for the sphere \mathbb{S}^{d-1} in \mathbb{R}^{d} for any dimension d\geq 3 in a restricted range of exponents given by the Stein-Tomas theorem. The proof consists of a simple observation. When d=3 the range corresponds exactly to the full Stein-Tomas one, but is otherwise a proper subset when d>3. We also present an application regarding the Lebesgue points of functions in \mathcal{F}(L^p) when p is sufficiently close to 1.
