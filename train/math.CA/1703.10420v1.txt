Differential and falsified sampling expansions \sum_{k\in \mathbb{Z}^d}c_k\phi(M^jx+k), where M is a matrix dilation, are studied. In the case of differential expansions, c_k=Lf(M^{-j}\cdot)(-k), where L is an appropriate differential operator. For a large class of functions \phi, the approximation order of differential expansions was recently studied. Some smoothness of the Fourier transform of \phi from this class is required. In the present paper, we obtain similar results for a class of band-limited functions \phi with the discontinuous Fourier transform. In the case of falsified expansions, c_k is the mathematical expectation of random integral average of a signal f near the point M^{-j}k. To estimate the approximation order of the falsified sampling expansions we compare them with the differential expansions. Error estimations in L_p-norm are given in terms of the Fourier transform of f.
