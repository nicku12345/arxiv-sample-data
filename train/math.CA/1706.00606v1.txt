It is shown that a function f is a generalized Stieltjes function of order \lambda>0 if and only if x^{1-\lambda}(x^{\lambda-1+k}f(x))^{(k)} is completely monotonic for all k\geq 0, thereby complementing a result due to Sokal. Furthermore, a characterization of those completely monotonic functions f for which x^{1-\lambda}(x^{\lambda-1+k}f(x))^{(k)} is completely monotonic for all k\leq n is obtained in terms of properties of the representing measure of f.
