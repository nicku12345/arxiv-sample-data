In the early 2000's, Littlejohn and Wellman developed a general left-definite theory for certain self-adjoint operators by fully determining their domains and spectral properties. The description of these domains do not feature explicit boundary conditions. We present characterizations of these domains given by the left-definite theory for all operators which possess a complete system of orthogonal eigenfunctions, in terms of classical boundary conditions.
