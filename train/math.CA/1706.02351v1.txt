For a real function f:[0,1]\to\mathbb{R}, the difference quotient of f is the function of two real variables \operatorname{DQ}_f(a,b)=\dfrac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a}, which we view as defined on the triangle \mathcal{T}=\{(a,b):0\leq a<b\leq1\}. In this paper we investigate how to determine whether a given function of two variables H(a,b) is the difference quotient of some real function f(x). We develop three independent methods for recognizing such a function H as a difference quotient, and corresponding methods for recovering the underlying function f from H.
