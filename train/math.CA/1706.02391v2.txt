In this paper we study the inverse spectral problem for Jacobi-type pencils. By a Jacobi-type pencil we mean the following pencil J_5 - \lambda J_3, where J_3 is a Jacobi matrix and J_5 is a semi-infinite real symmetric five-diagonal matrix with positive numbers on the second subdiagonal. In the case of a special perturbation of orthogonal polynomials on a finite interval the corresponding spectral function takes an explicit form.
