Starting from the Colombeau's full generalized functions, the sharp topologies and the notion of generalized points, we introduce a new kind differential calculus (for functions between totally disconnected spaces). We study generalized pointvalues, Colombeau's differential algebra, holomorphic and analytic functions. We show that the Embedding Theorem and the Open Mapping Theorem hold in this framework. Moreover, we study some applications in differential equations.
