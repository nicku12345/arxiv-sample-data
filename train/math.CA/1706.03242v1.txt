In this contribution we deal with sequences of monic polynomials orthogonal with respect to the Freud Sobolev-type inner product \begin{equation*} \left\langle p,q\right\rangle _{s}=\int_{\mathbb{R}}p(x)q(x)e^{-x^{4}}dx+M_{0}p(0)q(0)+M_{1}p^{\prime }(0)q^{\prime }(0), \end{equation*}% where p,q are polynomials, M_{0} and M_{1} are nonnegative real numbers. Connection formulas between these polynomials and Freud polynomials are deduced and, as a consequence, a five term recurrence relation for such polynomials is obtained. The location of their zeros as well as their asymptotic behavior is studied. Finally, an electrostatic interpretation of them in terms of a logarithmic interaction in the presence of an external field is given.
