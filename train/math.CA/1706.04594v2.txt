We consider a boundary value problem involving conformable derivative of order \alpha , 1<\alpha <2 and Dirichlet conditions. To prove the existence of solutions, we apply the method of upper and lower solutions together with Schauder's fixed-point theorem. \ Futhermore, we give the Lyapunov inequality for the corresponding problem.
