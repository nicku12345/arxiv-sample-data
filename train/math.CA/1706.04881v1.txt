We consider a general schema involving measure spaces, contractions and linear and continuous operators. Within the framework of this schema we use our sesquilinear uniform integral and introduce some integral operators on continuous vector functions spaces, which lead us to operators on spaces of vector measures. Using these last operators, we generalize the Markov operators, obtaining via contractions vector invariant (fractal) measures. Concrete examples are provided.
