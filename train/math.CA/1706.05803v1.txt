Let L_{1} and L_{2} be non-negative self-adjoint operators acting on L^{2}(X_{1}) and L^{2}(X_{2}), respectively, where X_{1} and X_{2} are spaces of homogeneous type. Assume that L_{1} and L_{2} have Gaussian heat kernel bounds. This paper aims to study some equivalent characterizations of the weighted product Hardy spaces H^{p}_{w,L_{1},L_{2}}(X_{1}\times X_{2}) associated to L_{1} and L_{2}, for p \in (0, \infty) and the weight w belongs to the product Muckenhoupt class A_{\infty}(X_{1} \times X_{2}). Our main result is that the spaces H^{p}_{w,L_{1},L_{2}}(X_{1}\times X_{2}) introduced via area functions can be equivalently characterized by Littlewood-Paley g-functions, Littlewood-Paley g^{\ast}_{\lambda_{1}, \lambda_{2}}-functions, and Peetre type maximal functions, without any further assumptions beyond the Gaussian upper bounds on the heat kernels of L_{1} and L_{2}. Our results are new even in the unweighted product setting.
