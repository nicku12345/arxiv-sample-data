Using the six parameters truncated Mittag-Leffler function, we introduce a convenient truncated function to define the so-called truncated \mathcal{V}-fractional derivative type. After a discussion involving some properties associated with this derivative, we propose the derivative of a vector valued function and define the \mathcal{V}-fractional Jacobian matrix whose properties allow us to say that: the multivariable truncated \mathcal{V}-fractional derivative type, as proposed here, generalizes the truncated \mathcal{V}-fractional derivative type and can bee extended to obtain a truncated \mathcal{V}-fractional partial derivative type. As applications we discuss and prove the change of order associated with two index i.e., the commutativity of two truncated \mathcal{V}-fractional partial derivative type and propose the truncated \mathcal{V}-fractional Green's theorem.
