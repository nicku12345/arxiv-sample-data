In this work, a generalization of Chebyshev functional is presented. New inequalities of Gruss type via Pompeiu's mean value theorem are established. Improvements of some old inequalities are proved. A generalization of pre-Gruss inequality is elaborated. Some remarks to further generalization of Chebyshev functional are presented. As applications, bounds for the reverse of CBS inequality are deduced. Hardy type inequalities on bounded real interval [a,b] under some other circumstances are introduced. Other related ramified inequalities for differentiable functions are also given.
