First we prove a Littlewood-Paley diagonalization result for bi-Lipschitz perturbations of the identity map on the real line. This result entails a number of corollaries for the Hilbert transform along lines and monomial curves in the plane. Second, we prove a square function bound for a single scale directional operator. As a corollary we give a new proof of part of a theorem of Katz on direction fields with finitely many directions.
