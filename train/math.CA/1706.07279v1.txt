In this paper, we introduce Durrmeyer type modification of Meyer-Konig-Zeller operators based on (p,q)-integers. Rate of convergence of these operators are explored with the help of Korovkin type theorems. We establish some direct results for proposed operators. We also obtain statistical approximation properties of operators. In last section, we show rate of convergence of (p,q)-Meyer-Konig-Zeller Durrmeyer operators for some functions by means of Matlab programming.
