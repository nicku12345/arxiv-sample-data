We investigate the influence that s-dimensional lower and upper Hausdorff densities have on the geometry of a Radon measure in \mathbb{R}^n when s is a real number between 0 and n. This topic in geometric measure theory has been extensively studied when s is an integer. In this paper, we focus on the non-integer case, building upon a series of papers on s-sets by Mart\'in and Mattila from 1988 to 2000. When 0<s<1, we prove that measures with almost everywhere positive lower density and finite upper density are carried by countably many bi-Lipschitz curves. When 1\leq s<n, we identify conditions on the lower density that ensure the measure is either carried by or singular to (1/s)-H\"older curves. The latter results extend part of the recent work of Badger and Schul, which examined the case s=1 (Lipschitz curves) in depth. Of further interest, we introduce H\"older and bi-Lipschitz parameterization theorems for Euclidean sets with "small" Assouad dimension.
