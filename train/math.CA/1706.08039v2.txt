We aim to introduce the generalized multiindex Bessel function J_{\left( \beta _{j}\right) _{m},\kappa ,b}^{\left( \alpha _{j}\right)_{m},\gamma ,c}\left[ z\right]  and to present some formulas of the Riemann-Liouville fractional integration and differentiation operators. Further, we also derive certain integral formulas involving the newly defined generalized multiindex Bessel function J_{\left( \beta _{j}\right) _{m},\kappa ,b}^{\left( \alpha _{j}\right)_{m},\gamma ,c}\left[ z\right] . We prove that such integrals are expressed in terms of the Fox-Wright function _{p}\Psi_{q}(z). The results presented here are of general in nature and easily reducible to new and known results.
