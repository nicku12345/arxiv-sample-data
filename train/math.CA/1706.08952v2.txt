In this paper, our main aim is to derive L^p-L^q estimates of the solution u_k(x,t) ( t fixed) of the Cauchy problem for the homogeneous linear wave equation associated to the Dunkl Laplacian \Delta_k, \Delta_ku_k(x,t)= \partial_t^2u_k (x,t),\quad \partial_tu_k(x,0)= f(x),\quad u_k(x,0)= g(x). We extend to Dunkl setting the estimates given by Srichartz in \cite{Sti} for the ordinary wave equation .
