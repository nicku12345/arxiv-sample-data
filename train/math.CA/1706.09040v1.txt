In this paper, we are going to describe the solutions of the functional equation    \varphi\Big(\frac{x+y}{2}\Big)(f(x)+f(y))=\varphi(x)f(x)+\varphi(y)f(y)  concerning the unknown functions \varphi and f defined on an open interval. In our main result only the continuity of the function \varphi and a regularity property of the set of zeroes of f are assumed. As application, we determine the solutions of the functional equation    G(g(u)-g(v))=H(h(u)+h(v))+F(u)+F(v)  under monotonicity and differentiability conditions on the unknown functions F,G,H,g,h.
