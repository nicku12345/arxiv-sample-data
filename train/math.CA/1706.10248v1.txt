This work considers a second order impulsive coupled system of differential equations with generalized jump conditions in half-line, which can depend on the impulses of the unknown functions and their first derivatives. The arguments apply the fixed point theory, Green's functions technique, L^11-Carath\'eodory functions and sequences and Schauder's fixed point theorem. The method is based on Carath\'eodory concept of functions and sequences, together with the equiconvergence on infinity and on each impulsive moment, and it allows to consider coupled fully nonlinearities and very general impulsive functions.
