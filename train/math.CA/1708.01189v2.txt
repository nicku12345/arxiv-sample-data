In signal processing the Rudin-Shapiro polynomials have good autocorrelation properties and their values on the unit circle are small. Binary sequences with low autocorrelation coefficients are of interest in radar, sonar, and communication systems. In this paper we show that the Mahler measure of the Rudin-Shapiro polynomials of degree n=2^k-1 is asymptotically (2n/e)^{1/2}, as it was conjectured by B. Saffari in 1985. Our approach is based heavily on the Saffari and Montgomery conjectures proved recently by B. Rodgers.
