We prove that the bilinear Hilbert transform along two polynomials B_{P,Q}(f,g)(x)=\int_{\mathbb{R}}f(x-P(t))g(x-Q(t))\frac{dt}{t} is bounded from L^p \times L^q to L^r for a large range of (p,q,r), as long as the polynomials P and Q have distinct leading and trailing degrees. The same boundedness property holds for the corresponding bilinear maximal function \mathcal{M}_{P,Q}(f,g)(x)=\sup_{\epsilon>0}\frac{1}{2\epsilon}\int_{-\epsilon}^{\epsilon} |f(x-P(t))g(x-Q(t))|dt.
