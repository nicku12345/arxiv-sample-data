In this work the interplay between matrix biorthogonal polynomials with respect to a matrix of linear functionals, the k-th associated matrix polynomials and the second kind matrix functions, is studied in terms of quasideterminants. A sort of Poincar\'{e}'s theorem for the ratio of two consecutive matrix functions solutions of a linear difference equation is also presented. Some new formulas connecting these families of matrix functions are given.
