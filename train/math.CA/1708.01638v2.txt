In this work is presented a study on matrix biorthogonal polynomials sequences that satisfy a nonsymmetric recurrence relation with unbounded coefficients. The ratio asymptotic for this family of matrix biorthogonal polynomials is derived in quite general assumptions. It is considered some illustrative examples.
