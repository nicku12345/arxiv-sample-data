We obtain a Landau -- Hadamard type inequality for mappings defined on the whole real axis and taking values in Riemannian manifolds. In terms of an auxiliary convex function, we find conditions under which the boundedness of covariant derivative along the curve under consideration ensures the boundedness of the corresponding tangent vector field. As an example we obtain a Landau -- Hadamard type inequality for curves on 2D unite sphere.
