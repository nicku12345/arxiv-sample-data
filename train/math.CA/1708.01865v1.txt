We obtain the L^p decay of oscillatory integral operators T_\lambda with certain homogeneous polynomial phase of degree d in (n+n)-dimensions. In this paper we require that d>2n. If d/(d-n)<p<d/n, the decay is sharp and the decay rate is related to the Newton distance. In the case of p=d/n or d/(d-n), we also obtain the almost sharp decay, here "almost" means the decay contains a \log(\lambda) term. For otherwise, the L^p decay of T_\lambda is also obtained but not sharp. A counterexample also arises in this paper to show that d/(d-n)\leq p\leq d/n is not necessary to guarantee the sharp decay.
