This article shows a very elementary and straightforward proof of the Implicit Function Theorem for differentiable maps F(x,y) defined on a finite-dimensional Euclidean space. There are no hypothesis on the continuity of the partial derivatives of F. The proof employs determinants theory, the mean-value theorem, the intermediate-value theorem, and Darboux's property (the intermediate-value property for derivatives). The proof avoids compactness arguments, fixed-point theorems, and integration theory. A stronger than the classical version of the Inverse Function Theorem is also shown. An example is given.
