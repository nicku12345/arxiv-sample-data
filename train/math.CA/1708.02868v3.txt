By combining classical techniques together with two novel asymptotic identities contained in [FL], we analyse certain single sums of Riemann-zeta type. In addition, we analyse Euler-Zagier double exponential sums for particular values of Re\{u\} and Re\{v\} and for a variety of sets of summation, as well as particular cases of Mordell-Tornheim double sums. Some of these results are used in [F] where a novel approach to the Lindel\"of hypothesis is presented.
