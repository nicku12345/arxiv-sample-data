The aim of this paper is to present the construction of exceptional Laguerre polynomials in a systematic way, and to provide new asymptotic results on the location of the zeros. To describe the exceptional Laguerre polynomials we associate them with two partitions. We find that the use of partitions is an elegant way to express these polynomials and we restate some of their known properties in terms of partitions. We discuss the asymptotic behavior of the regular zeros and the exceptional zeros of exceptional Laguerre polynomials as the degree tends to infinity.
