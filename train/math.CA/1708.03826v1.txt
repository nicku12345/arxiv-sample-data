The L^2 \to L^p adjoint Fourier restriction inequality on the d-dimensional hyperboloid \mathbb{H}^d \subset \mathbb{R}^{d+1} holds provided 6 \leq p < \infty, if d=1, and 2(d+2)/d \leq p\leq 2(d+1)/(d-1), if d\geq2. Quilodr\'{a}n recently found the values of the optimal constants in the endpoint cases (d,p)\in\{(2,4),(2,6),(3,4)\} and showed that the inequality does not have extremizers in these cases. In this paper we answer two questions posed by Quilodr\'{a}n, namely: (i) we find the explicit value of the optimal constant in the endpoint case (d,p) = (1,6) (the remaining endpoint for which p is an even integer) and show that there are no extremizers in this case; and (ii) we establish the existence of extremizers in all non-endpoint cases in dimensions d \in \{1,2\}. This completes the qualitative description of this problem in low dimensions.
