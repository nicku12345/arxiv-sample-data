We carry out a numerical investigation of the asymptotic expansion of the so-called Wright function {}_p\Psi_q(z) (a generalised hypergeometric function) in the case when exponentially small terms are present. This situation is covered by two theorems of Wright and Braaksma. We demonstrate that a more precise understanding of the behaviour of {}_p\Psi_q(z) is obtained by taking into account the Stokes phenomenon.
