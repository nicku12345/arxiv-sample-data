In this paper, we prove that the spectral curve \Gamma_{\mathbf{n}} of the generalized Lam\'{e} equation with the Treibich-Verdier potential \begin{equation*} y^{\prime \prime }(z)=\bigg[ \sum_{k=0}^{3}n_{k}(n_{k}+1)\wp(z+\tfrac{% \omega_{k}}{2}|\tau)+B\bigg] y(z),\text{ \ }n_{k}\in \mathbb{Z}_{\geq0} \end{equation*} can be embedded into the symmetric space Sym^{N}E_{\tau} of the N-th copy of the torus E_{\tau}, where N=\sum n_{k}. This embedding induces an addition map \sigma_{\mathbf{n}}(\cdot|\tau) from \Gamma_{\mathbf{n}} onto E_{\tau}. The main result is to prove that the degree of \sigma _{% \mathbf{n}}(\cdot|\tau) is equal to% \begin{equation*} \sum_{k=0}^{3}n_{k}(n_{k}+1)/2. \end{equation*} This is the first step toward constructing the premodular form associated with this generalized Lam\'{e} equation.
