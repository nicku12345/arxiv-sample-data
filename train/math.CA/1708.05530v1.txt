By Descartes' rule of signs, a real degree d polynomial P with all nonvanishing coefficients, with c sign changes and p sign preservations in the sequence of its coefficients (c+p=d) has pos\leq c positive and neg\leq p negative roots, where pos\equiv c(\, mod 2) and neg\equiv p(\, mod 2). For 1\leq d\leq 3, for every possible choice of the sequence of signs of coefficients of P (called sign pattern) and for every pair (pos, neg) satisfying these conditions there exists a polynomial P with exactly pos positive and exactly neg negative roots (all of them simple). For d\geq 4 this is not so. It was observed that for 4\leq d\leq 10, in all nonrealizable cases either pos=0 or neg=0. It was conjectured that this is the case for any d\geq 4. We show a counterexample to this conjecture for d=11. Namely, we prove that for the sign pattern (+,-,-,-,-,-,+,+,+,+,+,-) and the pair (1,8) there exists no polynomial with 1 positive, 8 negative simple roots and a complex conjugate pair.
