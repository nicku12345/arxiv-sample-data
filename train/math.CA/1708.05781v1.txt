We provide a new closed form expression for the Geronimus polynomials on the unit circle and use it to obtain new results and formulas. Among our results is a universality result at an endpoint of an arc for polynomials orthogonal with respect to a Geronimus type weight on an arc of the unit circle. The key tool is a formula of McLaughlin for powers of a two-by-two matrix, which we use to derive convenient formulas for Geronimus polynomials.
