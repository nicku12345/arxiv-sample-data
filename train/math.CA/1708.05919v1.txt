For a compact set E \subset \mathbb R^d and a connected graph G on k+1 vertices, we define a G-framework to be a collection of k+1 points in E such that the distance between a pair of points is specified if the corresponding vertices of G are connected by an edge. We regard two such frameworks as equivalent if the specified distances are the same. We show that in a suitable sense the set of equivalences of such frameworks naturally embeds in {\mathbb R}^m where m is the number of "essential" edges of G. We prove that there exists a threshold s_k<d such that if the Hausdorff dimension of E is greater than s_k, then the m-dimensional Hausdorff measure of the set of equivalences of G-frameworks is positive. The proof relies on combinatorial, topological and analytic considerations.
