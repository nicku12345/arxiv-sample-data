The main purpose of this paper is to introduce and investigate the various properties of a new generalization of Apostol Hermite-Genocchi polynomials. We derive many useful results involving new generalized Apostol Hermite-Genocchi polynomials. We also consider some statistical application of the new family in probability distribution theory and reliability.
