Given a function f\colon \mathbb{R}\to \mathbb{R}, the so-called "little lip" function \operatorname{lip} f is defined as follows: \begin{equation*} \operatorname{lip}   f(x)=\liminf_{r{\scriptscriptstyle \searrow} 0}\sup_{|x-y|\le r} \frac{|f(y)-f(x)|}{r}. \end{equation*} We show that if f is continuous on \mathbb{R}, then the set where \operatorname{lip} f is infinite is a countable union of a countable intersection of closed sets (that is an F_{\sigma \delta} set). On the other hand, given a countable union of closed sets E, we construct a continuous function f such that \operatorname{lip} f is infinite exactly on E. A further result is that for the typical continuous function f on the real line \operatorname{lip} f vanishes almost everywhere.
