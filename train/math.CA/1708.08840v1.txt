In this paper, we explain a sharp phase transition phenomenon which occurs for L^p-Carleman classes with exponents 0<p<1. In principle, these classes are defined as usual, only the traditional L^\infty-bounds are replaced by corresponding L^p-bounds. To mirror the classical definition, we add the feature of dilatation invariance as well, and consider a larger soft-topology space, the L^p-Carleman class. A particular degenerate instance is when we obtain the L^p-Sobolev spaces, analyzed previously by Peetre, following an initial insight by Douady. Peetre found that these L^p-Sobolev spaces are highly degenerate for 0<p<1. Essentially, the contact is lost between the function and its derivatives. Here, we analyze this degeneracy for the more general L^p-Carleman classes defined by a weight sequence. Under some reasonable growth and regularity properties, and a condition on the collection of test functions, we find that there is a sharp boundary, defined in terms of the weight sequence: on the one side, we get Douady-Peetre's phenomenon of "disconnexion" between the function and its derivatives, while on the other, we obtain a collection of highly smooth functions. We also look at the more standard second phase transition, between non-quasianalyticity and quasianalyticity, in the L^p setting, with 0<p<1.
