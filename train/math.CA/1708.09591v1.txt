In this paper we study summability based on double sequences of complex constants as it is defined in "Linear Operators, General Theory" by N. Dunford and J. T. Schwartz. We define "power double sequences" or infinite "power matrices" as certain generalizations of double sequences and power series. We relate the summability and boundedness of the power double sequences to the summability and boundedness of the double sequence \textit{A}. While others do investigate "power matrices" their definitions, as far as we were able to find, differ from our definitions. Using these definitions we extend some summability results for double sequences of constants to our power double sequences. We investigate also other possible generalizations of double sequences and assess their usefulness in summability study.
