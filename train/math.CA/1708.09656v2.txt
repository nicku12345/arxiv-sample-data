We employ the exponentially improved asymptotic expansions of the confluent hypergeometric functions on the Stokes lines discussed by the author [Appl. Math. Sci. {\bf 7} (2013) 6601--6609] to give the analogous expansions of the modified Bessel functions I_\nu(z) and K_\nu(z) for large z and finite \nu on \arg\,z=\pm\pi (and, in the case of I_\nu(z), also on \arg\,z=0). Numerical results are presented to illustrate the accuracy of these expansions.
