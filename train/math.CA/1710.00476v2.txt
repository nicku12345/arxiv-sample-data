Pseudo-differential operators of type (1,1) and order m are continuous from F_p^{s+m,q} to F_p^{s,q} if s>d/\min{(1,p,q)}-d for 0<p<\infty, and from B_p^{s+m,q} to B_{p}^{s,q} if s>d/\min{(1,p)}-d for 0<p\leq\infty. In this work we extend the F-boundedness result to p=\infty. Additionally, we prove that the operators map F_{\infty}^{m,1} into bmo when s=0, and consider H\"ormander's twisted diagonal condition for arbitrary s\in\mathbb{R}. We also prove that the restrictions on s are necessary conditions for the boundedness to hold.
