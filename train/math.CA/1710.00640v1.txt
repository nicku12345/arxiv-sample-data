We raise a question on the existence of continuous roots of families of monic polynomials (by the root of a family of polynomials we mean a function of the coefficients of polynomials of a given family that maps each tuple of coefficients to a root of the polynomial with these coefficients). We prove that the family of monic second-degree polynomials with complex coefficients and the families of monic fourth-degree and fifth-degree polynomials with real coefficients have no continuous root. We also prove that the family of monic second-degree polynomials with real coefficients has continuous roots and we describe the set of all such roots.
