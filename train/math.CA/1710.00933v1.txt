We give a weak-type counterpart of the main result in an earlier work of the first author, E. Rela and T. Luque which allows to provide a lower bound for the exponent of the A_{p} constant in terms of the behaviour of the unweighted inequalities when p\rightarrow\infty and when p\rightarrow1^{+}. We also provide some applications to classical operators.
