Family of quasi-arithmetic means has a natural, partial order (point-wise order) A^{[f]}\le A^{[g]} if and only if A^{[f]}(v)\le A^{[g]}(v) for all admissible vectors v (f,\,g and, later, h are continuous and monotone and defined on a common interval). Therefore one can introduce the notion of interval-type sets (sets \mathcal{I} such that whenever A^{[f]} \le A^{[h]} \le A^{[g]} for some A^{[f]},\,A^{[g]} \in \mathcal{I} then A^{[h]} \in \mathcal{I} too). Our aim is to give examples of interval-type sets involving vary smoothness assumptions of generating functions.
