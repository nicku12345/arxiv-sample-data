In this paper, we establish the boundedness of the commutators of multilinear Hausdorff operators on the product of some weighted Morrey-Herz type spaces with variable exponent with their symbols belong to both Lipschitz space and central BMO space. By these, we generalize and strengthen some previous known results.
