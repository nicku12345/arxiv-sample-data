In this note we give a new proof of the sharp constant C = e^{-1/2} + \int_0^1 e^{-x^2/2}\,dx in the weak (1, 1) inequality for the dyadic square function. The proof makes use of two Bellman functions \mathbb{L} and \mathbb{M} related to the problem, and relies on certain relationships between \mathbb{L} and \mathbb{M}, as well as the boundary values of these functions, which we find explicitly. Moreover, these Bellman functions exhibit an interesting behavior: the boundary solution for \mathbb{M} yields the optimal obstacle condition for \mathbb{L}, and vice versa.
