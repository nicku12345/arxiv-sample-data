In this work we give some maximal inequalities in Triebel-Lizorkin spaces, which are "\dot{F}_{\infty}^{s,q}-variants" of Fefferman-Stein vector-valued maximal inequality and Peetre's maximal inequality. We will give some applications of the new maximal inequalities and discuss sharpness of some results.
