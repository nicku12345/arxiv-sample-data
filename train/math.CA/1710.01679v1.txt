We give an explicit formula for the logarithmic potential of the asymptotic zero-counting measure of the sequence \left\{\frac{\mathrm{d}^n}{\mathrm{d}z^n}\left(R(z)\exp{T(z)}\right)\right\}. Here, R(z) is a rational function with at least two poles, all of which are distinct, and T(z) is a polynomial. This is an extension of a recent measure-theoretic refinement of P\'olya's Shire theorem for rational functions.
