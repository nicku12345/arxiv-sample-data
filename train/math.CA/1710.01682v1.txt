This note provides a detailed algorithm to the application of local (perturbation) analysis of differential equations which is normally taught at graduate math courses. Exercise books often present more abstract and simplified versions of equations for the application of perturbation techniques. The equation we study comes from the theory of competing mechanisms and describes the behavior of rational buyers in a certain environment. While in the latter literature similar equations were solved numerically, an analytical solution adds both theoretical and practical value for students and researchers.
