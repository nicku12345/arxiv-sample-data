We study the constrained minimum energy problem with an external field relative to the \alpha-Riesz kernel |x-y|^{\alpha-n} of order \alpha\in(0,n) for a generalized condenser \mathbf A=(A_i)_{i\in I} in \mathbb R^n, n\geqslant 3, whose oppositely charged plates intersect each other over a set of zero capacity. Conditions sufficient for the existence of minimizers are found, and their uniqueness and vague compactness are studied. Conditions obtained are shown to be sharp. We also analyze continuity of the minimizers in the vague and strong topologies when the condenser and the constraint both vary, describe the weighted equilibrium vector potentials, and single out their characteristic properties. Our arguments are based particularly on the simultaneous use of the vague topology and a suitable semimetric structure on a set of vector measures associated with \mathbf A, and the establishment of completeness theorems for proper semimetric spaces. The results remain valid for the logarithmic kernel on \mathbb R^2 and \mathbf A with compact A_i, i\in I. The study is illustrated by several examples.
