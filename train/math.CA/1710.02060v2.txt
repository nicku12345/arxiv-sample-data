The aim of this paper is to characterize the so-called Hardy means, i.e., those means M\colon\bigcup_{n=1}^\infty \mathbb{R}_+^n\to\mathbb{R}_+ that satisfy the inequality    \sum_{n=1}^\infty M(x_1,\dots,x_n) \le C\sum_{n=1}^\infty x_n  for all positive sequences (x_n) with some finite positive constant C. The smallest constant C satisfying this property is called the Hardy constant of the mean M.   In this paper we determine the Hardy constant in the cases when the mean M is either a concave quasi-arithmetic or a concave and homogeneous deviation mean.
