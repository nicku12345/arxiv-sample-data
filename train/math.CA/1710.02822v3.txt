In this paper, we give explicit expressions of differential-difference operators appeared in the hypothesis of the general Fourier multiplier theorem associated to the Heisenberg groups proved by Mauceri and De Micheal for one dimension and C. Lin for higher dimension. We also give a much shorter proof of the above-mentioned theorem. Then we obtain a sharp weighted estimate for Fourier multipliers on the Heisenberg groups.
