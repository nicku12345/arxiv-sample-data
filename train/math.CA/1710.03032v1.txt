We study a localization of functions defined on Vilenkin groups. To measure the localization we introduce two uncertainty products UP_{\lambda} and UP_{G} that are similar to the Heisenberg uncertainty product. UP_{\lambda} and UP_{G} differ from each other by the metric used for the Vilenkin group G. We discuss analogs of a quantitative uncertainty principle. Representations for UP_{\lambda} and UP_{G} in terms of Walsh and Haar basis are given.
