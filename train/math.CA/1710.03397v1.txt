In this paper we extend the theory of two weight, A_p bump conditions to the setting of matrix weights. We prove two matrix weight inequalities for fractional maximal operators, fractional and singular integrals, sparse operators and averaging operators. As applications we prove quantitative, one weight estimates, in terms of the matrix A_p constant, for singular integrals, and prove a Poincar\'e inequality related to those that appear in the study of degenerate elliptic PDEs.
