In this work, we introduce the class of h-{\rm{MN}}-convex functions by generalizing the concept of {\rm{MN}}-convexity and combining it with h-convexity. Namely, Let I,J be two intervals subset of \left(0,\infty\right) such that \left(0,1\right)\subseteq J and \left[a,b\right]\subseteq I. Consider a non-negative function h: (0,\infty)\to \left(0,\infty\right) and let {\rm{M}}:\left[0,1\right]\to \left[a,b\right]  (0<a<b) be a Mean function given by {\rm{{\rm{M}}}}\left(t\right)={\rm{{\rm{M}}}}\left( {h(t);a,b} \right); where by {\rm{{\rm{M}}}}\left( {h(t);a,b} \right) we mean one of the following functions: A_h\left( {a,b} \right):=h\left( {1 - t} \right)a + h(t) b, G_h\left( {a,b} \right)=a^{h(1-t)} b^{h(t)} and H_h\left( {a,b} \right):=\frac{ab}{h(t) a + h\left( {1 - t} \right)b} = \frac{1}{A_h\left( {\frac{1}{a},\frac{1}{b}} \right)}; with the property that {\rm{{\rm{M}}}}\left( {h(0);a,b} \right)=a and {\rm{M}}\left( {h(1);a,b} \right)=b.   A function f : I \to \left(0,\infty\right) is said to be h-{\rm{{\rm{MN}}}}-convex (concave) if the inequality \begin{align*} f \left({\rm{M}}\left(t;x, y\right)\right) \le (\ge) \, {\rm{N}}\left(h(t);f (x), f (y)\right), \end{align*} holds for all x,y \in I and t\in [0,1], where M and N are two mean functions. In this way, nine classes of h-{\rm{MN}}-convex functions are established and some of their analytic properties are explored and investigated. Characterizations of each type are given. Various Jensen's type inequalities and their converses are proved.
