In this paper we study some questions about the continuity of classical and fractional maximal operators in the Sobolev space W^{1,1}, in both continuous and discrete setting, giving a positive answer to two questions posed recently, one of them regarding the continuity of the map f \mapsto \big(\widetilde M_{\beta}f\big)' from W^{1,1}(\mathbb{R}) to L^q(\mathbb{R}), for q=\frac{1}{1-\beta}. Here \widetilde M_{\beta} denotes the non-centered fractional maximal operator on \mathbb{R} with \beta\in(0,1). The second one regarding the continuity of the discrete centered maximal operator in the space of functions of bounded variation BV(\mathbb{Z}), complementing some recent boundedness results.
