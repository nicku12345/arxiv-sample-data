Given two continuous functions f,g:I\to\mathbb{R} such that g is positive and f/g is strictly monotone, a measurable space (T,A), a measurable family of d-variable means m: I^d\times T\to I, and a probability measure \mu on the measurable sets A, the d-variable mean M_{f,g,m;\mu}:I^d\to I is defined by    M_{f,g,m;\mu}(\pmb{x})   :=\left(\frac{f}{g}\right)^{-1}\left(   \frac{\int_T f\big(m(x_1,\dots,x_d,t)\big)\,d\mu(t)}   {\int_T g\big(m(x_1,\dots,x_d,t)\big)\,d\mu(t)}\right)   \qquad(\pmb{x}=(x_1,\dots,x_d)\in I^d).  The aim of this paper is to solve the equality and homogeneity problems of these means, i.e., to find conditions for the generating functions (f,g) and (h,k), for the family of means m, and for the measure \mu such that the equality    M_{f,g,m;\mu}(\pmb{x})=M_{h,k,m;\mu}(\pmb{x}) \qquad(\pmb{x}\in I^d)  and the homogeneity property    M_{f,g,m;\mu}(\lambda\pmb{x})=\lambda M_{f,g,m;\mu}(\pmb{x})   \qquad(\lambda>0,\,\pmb{x},\lambda\pmb{x}\in I^d),  respectively, be satisfied.
