Motivated by the {\rm \Psi}-Riemann-Liouville ({\rm \Psi-RL}) fractional derivative and by the {\rm \Psi}-Hilfer ({\rm \Psi-H}) fractional derivative, we introduced a new fractional operator the so-called \rm\Psi-fractional integral. We present some important results by means of theorems and in particular, that the \rm\Psi-fractional integration operator is limited. In this sense, we discuss some examples, in particular, involving the Mittag-Leffler ({\rm M-L}) function, of paramount importance in the solution of population growth problem, as approached. On the other hand, we realize a brief discussion on the uniqueness of nonlinear \Psi-fractional Volterra integral equation ({\rm VIE}) using \beta-distance functions.
