In this paper we introduce the notion of \zeta-crossbreeding in a set of \zeta-factorization formulas and also the notion of complete hybrid formula as the final result of that crossbreeding. The last formula is used as a criterion for selection of families of \zeta-kindred elements in class of real continuous functions.   Dedicated to recalling of Gregory Mendel's pea-crossbreeding.
