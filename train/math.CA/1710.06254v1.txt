We prove new results for multi-parameter singular integrals. For example, we prove that bi-parameter singular integrals in \mathbb{R}^{n+m} satisfying natural T1 type conditions map L^q(\mathbb{R}^n; L^p(\mathbb{R}^m;E)) to L^q(\mathbb{R}^n; L^p(\mathbb{R}^m;E)) for all p,q \in (1,\infty) and UMD function lattices E. This result is shown to hold even in the \mathcal{R}-boundedness sense for all suitable families of bi-parameter singular integrals. On the technique side we demonstrate how many dyadic multi-parameter operators can be bounded by using, and further developing, the theory of operator-valued dyadic shifts. Even in the scalar-valued case this is an efficient way to bound the various so called partial paraproducts, which are key operators appearing in the multi-parameter representation theorems. Our proofs also entail verifying the \mathcal{R}-boundedness of various families of multi-parameter paraproducts.
