In this note, we investigate C^2 differential images of the homogeneous self-similar measure associated with an IFS \mathcal{I}=\{\rho x+a_j\}_{j=1}^m satisfying the strong separation condition and a positive probability vector \vec{p}. It is shown that the Fourier transforms of such image measures have power decay for any contractive ratio \rho\in (0, 1/m), any translation vector \vec{a}=(a_1, \ldots, a_m) and probability vector \vec{p}, which extends a result of Kaufman on Bernoulli convolutions. Our proof relies on a key combinatorial lemma originated from Erd\H{o}s, which is important in estimating the oscillatory integrals. An application to the existence of normal numbers in fractals is also given.
