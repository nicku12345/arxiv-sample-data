We extend the definitions of \nabla-convex and completely monotonic functions for two variables. Some general identities of Popoviciu type for sum \sum \sum p_{ij} f(y_i, z_j) and integrals \int P(y)f(y) dy, \int \int P(y,z) f(y,z) dy \, dz are deduced. Using obtained identities, positivity of these expressions are characterized for higher order \nabla-convex and completely monotonic functions. Some applications in terms of generalized Cauchy means and exponential convexity are given.
