Recently, various extensions and variants of Bessel functions of several kinds have been presented. Among them, the (p,q)-confluent hypergeometric function \Phi_{p,q} has been introduced and investigated. Here, we aim to introduce an extended (p,q)-Whittaker function by using the function \Phi_{p,q} and establish its various properties and associated formulas such as integral representations, some transformation formulas and differential formulas. Relevant connections of the results presented here With those involving relatively simple Whittaker functions are also pointed out.
