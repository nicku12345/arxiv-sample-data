In this paper we study the regularity of the non-centered fractional maximal operator M_{\beta}. As the main result, we prove that there exists C(n,\beta) such that if q=n/(n-\beta) and f is a radial function, then \|DM_{\beta}f\|_{L^{q}(\mathbb{R}^n)}\leq C(n,\beta)\|Df\|_{L^{1}(\mathbb{R}^n)}. The corresponding result was previously known only if n=1 or \beta=0. Our proofs are almost free from one-dimensional arguments. Therefore, we believe that the new approach may be very useful when trying to extend the result for all f\in W^{1,1}(\mathbb{R}^n).
