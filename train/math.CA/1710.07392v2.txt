We prove Bloom type two-weight inequalities for commutators of multilinear singular integral operators including Calder\'on-Zygmund operators and their dyadic counterparts. Such estimates are further extended to a general higher order multilinear setting. The proof involves a pointwise sparse domination of multilinear commutators.
