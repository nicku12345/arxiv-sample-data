This result sharpens the bilinear to linear deduction of Lee and Vargas for extension estimates on the hyperbolic paraboloid in \mathbb R^3 to the sharp line, leading to the first scale-invariant restriction estimates, beyond the Stein--Tomas range, for a hypersurface on which the principal curvatures have different signs.
