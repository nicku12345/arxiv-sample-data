We establish optimal Lebesgue estimates for a class of generalized Radon transforms defined by averaging functions along polynomial-like curves. The presence of an essentially optimal weight allows us to prove uniform estimates, wherein the Lebesgue exponents are completely independent of the curves and the operator norms depend only on the polynomial degree. Moreover, our weighted estimates possess rather strong diffeomorphism invariance properties, allowing us to obtain uniform bounds for averages on curves satisfying a natural nilpotency hypothesis.
