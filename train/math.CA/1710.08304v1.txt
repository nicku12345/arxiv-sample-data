If T is the operator given by convolution with surface measure on the sphere, (E,F) is a quasi-extremal pair of sets for T if \langle T\chi_E, \chi_F \rangle \gtrsim |E|^{d/(d+1)}|F|^{d/(d+1)}. In this article, we explicitly define a family \mathcal{F} of quasi-extremal pairs of sets for T. We prove that \mathcal{F} is fundamental in the sense that every quasi-extremal pair (E,F) is comparable (in a rather strong sense) to a pair from \mathcal{F}. This extends work carried out by M. Christ for convolution with surface measure on the paraboloid.
