This study is devoted to the polynomial representation of the matrix pth root functions. The Fibonacci-H\"orner decomposition of the matrix powers and some techniques arisen from properties of generalized Fibonacci sequences, notably the Binet formula, serves as a triggering factor to provide explicit formulas for the matrix pth roots. Special cases and illustrative numerical examples are given.
