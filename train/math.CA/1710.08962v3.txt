The purpose of this paper is to give some characterizations of the weight functions w such that Mw is in A_{\infty}. We show that for those weights to be in A_{\infty} ensures to be in A_{1}. We give a criterion in terms of the local maximal functions m_{\lambda} and we present a pair of applications, among them someone similar to the Coifman-Rochberg characterization of A_{1} but using functions of the form (f^{\#})^{\delta} and (m_{\lambda}u)^{\delta} instead of (Mf)^{\delta}.
