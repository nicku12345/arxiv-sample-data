We show that, for certain non-smooth bounded domains \Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^n, the real interpolation space (L^p(\Omega), W^{1,p}(\Omega))_{s,p} is the subspace \widetilde W^{s,p}(\Omega) \subset L^p(\Omega) induced by the restricted fractional seminorm  |f|_{\widetilde W^{s,p}(\Omega)} = \Big( \int_\Omega \int_{|x-y|<\frac{d(x)}2} \frac{|f(x)-f(y)|^p}{|x-y|^{n+sp}} \, dy \,dx \Big)^\frac{1}{p}.  In particular, the above result includes simply connected uniform domains in the plane, for which a characterization of the interpolation space was previously unknown.
