In this paper, we establish some bilinear endpoint estimates of Calder\'on commutator \mathcal{C}[\nabla A,f](x) with a homogeneous kernel when \Omega\in L\log^+L(\mathbf{S}^{d-1}). More precisely, we prove that \mathcal{C}[\nabla A,f] maps L^q(\mathbb{R}^d)\times L^1(\mathbb{R}^d) to L^{r,\infty}(\mathbb{R}^d) if q>d which improves previous result essentially. If q=d, we show that Calder\'on commutator maps L^{d,1}(\mathbb{R}^d)\times L^1(\mathbb{R}^d) to L^{r,\infty}(\mathbb{R}^d) which is new even if the kernel is smooth. The novelty in the paper is that we prove a new endpoint estimate of the Mary Weiss maximal function which may have its own interest in the theory of singular integral.
