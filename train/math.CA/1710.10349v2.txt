The sharp range of L^p-estimates for the class of H\"ormander-type oscillatory integral operators is established in all dimensions under a positive-definite assumption on the phase. This is achieved by generalising a recent approach of the first author for studying the Fourier extension operator, which utilises polynomial partitioning arguments.
