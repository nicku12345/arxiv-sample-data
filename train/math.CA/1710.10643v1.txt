The solution of equations from the title is well known since the Euler's time. However, its proof in the case of multiple roots of the characteristic polynomial is rather long and technical and even appearance of the factors x^m looks artificial. A new proof, proposed below, seems not only shorter, but also more comprehensible for the students of any level.
