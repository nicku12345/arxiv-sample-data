The truncated Fourier operator \mathscr{F}_{\mathbb{R^{+}}},  (\mathscr{F}_{\mathbb{R^{+}}}x)(t)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} \int\limits_{\mathbb{R^{+}}}x(\xi)e^{it\xi}\,d\xi\,,\ \ \ t\in{}{\mathbb{R^{+}}},  is studied. The operator \mathscr{F}_{\mathbb{R^{+}}} is considered as an operator acting in the space L^2(\mathbb{R^{+}}). The functional model for the operator \mathscr{F}_{\mathbb{R^{+}}} is constructed. This functional model is the multiplication operator on the appropriate 2\times2 matrix function acting in the space L^2(\mathbb{R^{+}})\oplus{}L^2(\mathbb{R^{+}}). Using this functional model, the spectrum of the operator \mathscr{F}_{\mathbb{R^{+}}} is found. The resolvent of the operator \mathscr{F}_{\mathbb{R^{+}}} is estimated near its spectrum.
