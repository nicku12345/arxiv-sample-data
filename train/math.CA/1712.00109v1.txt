A symmetrization inequality of Rogers and of Brascamp-Lieb-Luttinger states that for a certain class of multilinear integral expressions, among tuples of sets of prescribed Lebesgue measures, tuples of balls centered at the origin are among the maximizers. Under natural hypotheses, we characterize all maximizing tuples for these inequalities for dimensions strictly greater than 1. We establish a sharpened form of the inequality.
