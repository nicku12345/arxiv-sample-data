In this work, a sequence of orthonormal rational functions that is also biorthogonal to another sequence of rational functions arising from recurrence relations of R_{II} type is constructed. The biorthogonality is proved by a procedure which we call Zhedanov method. A particular case of a sequence of orthonormal rational functions having denominators of special form is considered to motivate the general case. The particular case provides a Christoffel type transformation of the generalized eigenvalue problem with a reformulation different from the existing literature.
