Let \mathcal T_\alpha~(0\leq\alpha<n) be a class of sublinear operators satisfying certain size conditions introduced by Soria and Weiss, and let [b,\mathcal T_\alpha]~(0\leq\alpha<n) be the commutators generated by \mathrm{BMO}(\mathbb R^n) functions and \mathcal T_\alpha. This paper is concerned with two-weight, weak type norm estimates for these sublinear operators and their commutators on the weighted Morrey and amalgam spaces. Some boundedness criterions for such operators are given, under the assumptions that weak-type norm inequalities on weighted Lebesgue spaces are satisfied. As applications of our main results, we can obtain the weak-type norm inequalities for several integral operators as well as the corresponding commutators in the framework of weighted Morrey and amalgam spaces.
