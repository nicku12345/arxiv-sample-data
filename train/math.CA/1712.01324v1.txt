We introduce polynomial sets of (p,q)-Appell type and give some of their characterizations. The algebraic properties of the set of all polynomial sequences of (p,q)-Appell type are studied. Next, we give a recurrence relation and a (p,q)-difference equation for those polynomials. Finally, some examples of polynomial sequences of (p,q)-Appell type are given, particularly, a set of (p,q)-Hermite polynomials is given and their three-term recurrence relation and a second order homogeneous (p,q)-difference equation are provided.
