In this paper we study sharp generalizations of \dot{F}_p^{0,q} multiplier theorem of Mikhlin-H\"ormander type. The class of multipliers that we consider involves Herz spaces K_u^{s,t}. Plancherel's theorem proves \widehat{L_s^2}=K_2^{s,2} and we study the optimal triple (u,t,s) for which \sup_{k\in\mathbb{Z}}{\big\Vert \big( m(2^k\cdot)\varphi\big)^{\vee}\big\Vert_{K_u^{s,t}}}<\infty implies \dot{F}_p^{0,q} boundedness of multiplier operator T_m where \varphi is a cutoff function. Our result also covers the BMO-type space \dot{F}_{\infty}^{0,q}.
