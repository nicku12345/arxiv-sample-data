We establish the sharp growth rate, in terms of cardinality, of the L^p norms of the maximal Hilbert transform H_\Omega along finite subsets of a finite order lacunary set of directions \Omega \subset \mathbb R^3, answering a question of Parcet and Rogers in dimension n=3. Our result is the first sharp estimate for maximal directional singular integrals in dimensions greater than 2.   The proof relies on a representation of the maximal directional Hilbert transform in terms of a model maximal operator associated to compositions of two-dimensional angular multipliers, as well as on the usage of weighted norm inequalities, and their extrapolation, in the directional setting.
