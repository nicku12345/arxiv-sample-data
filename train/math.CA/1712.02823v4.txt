Given a lower content d-regular set in \mathbb{R}^n, we prove that the subset of points in E where a certain Dini-type condition on the so-called Jones \beta numbers holds coincides with the set of tangent points of E, up to a set of \mathcal{H}^d-measure zero. The main point of our result is that \mathcal{H}^d|_E is not assumed to be \sigma-finite; because of this, we use a certain variant of the \beta coefficient, firstly introduced by Azzam and Schul in [AS1], which is given in terms of integration with respect to the Hausdorff content.
