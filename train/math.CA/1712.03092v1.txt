We prove the L^p-boundedness, 1<p<\infty, of the Polynomial Carleson operator in general dimension. This follows the author's resolution of the one dimensional case as well as the work of Zorin-Kranich on the higher dimensional case in the setting 2\leq p<\infty. The techniques used in this paper are direct adaptations and natural extensions to the higher dimensional case of the one-dimensional methods developed by the author.
