In this paper, we find explicit formulas for higher order derivatives of the inverse tangent function. More precisely, we study polynomials which are induced from the higher-order derivatives of arctan(x). Successively, we give generating functions, recurrence relations and some particular properties for these polynomials. Connections to Chebyshev, Fibonacci, Lucas and Matching polynomials are established.
