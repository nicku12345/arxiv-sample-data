In this paper, we first introduce some new classes of weighted amalgam spaces. Then we give the weighted strong-type and weak-type estimates for fractional integral operators I_\gamma on these new function spaces. Furthermore, the weighted strong-type estimate and endpoint estimate of linear commutators [b,I_{\gamma}] generated by b and I_{\gamma} are established as well. In addition, we are going to study related problems about two-weight, weak type inequalities for I_{\gamma} and [b,I_{\gamma}] on the weighted amalgam spaces and give some results. Based on these results and pointwise domination, we can prove norm inequalities involving fractional maximal operator M_{\gamma} and generalized fractional integrals \mathcal L^{-\gamma/2} in the context of weighted amalgam spaces, where 0<\gamma<n and \mathcal L is the infinitesimal generator of an analytic semigroup on L^2(\mathbb R^n) with Gaussian kernel bounds.
