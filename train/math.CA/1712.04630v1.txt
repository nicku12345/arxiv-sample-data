In this paper, we establish a generalized Taylor expansion of a given function f in the form   \displaystyle{f(x) = \sum_{j=0}^m c_j^{\alpha,\rho}\left(x^\rho-a^\rho\right)^{j\alpha} + e_m(x)}   \noindent with m\in \mathbb{N}, c_j^{\alpha,\rho}\in \mathbb{R}, x>a and 0< \alpha \leq 1. In case \rho = \alpha = 1, this expression coincides with the classical Taylor formula. The coefficients c_j^{\alpha,\rho}, j=0,\dots,m as well as an estimation of e_m(x) are given in terms of the generalized Caputo-type fractional derivatives. Some applications of these results for approximation of functions and for solving some fractional differential equations in series form are given in illustration.
