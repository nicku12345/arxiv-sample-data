The aim of this paper is to give the characterisation of the L p Range (p \ge 2) of the Generalised Poisson Transform of the Hyperbolic space B(H n), (n \ge 2), over the classical field of the quaternions H. Namely, if f is an hyperfunction in the boundary of B(H n), then we show that f is in L p (\partialB(H n)) if and only if it's generalised poisson transform satisfy an Hardy type growth condition. An explicit expression of the generalized spherical functions is given. Mathematics Subject Classification (2010). Primary 22E46; Secondary 33Cxx.
