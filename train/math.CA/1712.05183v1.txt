We consider variants on the classical Berz sublinearity theorem, using only DC, the Axiom of Dependent Choices, rather than AC, the Axiom of Choice which Berz used. We consider thinned versions, in which conditions are imposed on only part of the domain of the function -- results of quantifier-weakening type. There are connections with classical results on subadditivity. We close with a discussion of the extensive related literature.
