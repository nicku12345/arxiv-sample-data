We prove that the finite field Fourier extension operator for the paraboloid is bounded from L^2\to L^r for r\geq \frac{2d+4}{d} in even dimensions d\ge 8, which is the optimal L^2 estimate. For d=6 we obtain the optimal range r> \frac{2d+4}{d}=8/3, apart from the endpoint. For d=4 we improve the prior range of r>16/5=3.2 to r\geq 28/9=3.111\ldots, compared to the conjectured range of r\geq3. The key new ingredient is improved additive energy estimates for subsets of the paraboloid.
