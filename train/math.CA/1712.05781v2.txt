Sharp weighted estimates are obtained for vector-valued extensions of the Hardy-Littlewood maximal operator, Calder\'on-Zygmund operators and Coifman-Rochberg-Weiss commutator. Those estimates will rely upon suitable pointwise estimates in terms of sparse operators. We also prove some new results for the C_p classes introduced by Muckenhoupt and later extended by Sawyer, in particular we extend the result to the full expected range p > 0, to the weak norm, to other operators and to the their vector-valued extensions.
