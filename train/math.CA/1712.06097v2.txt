Several infinite products are studied that satisfy the transformation relation of the type f(\alpha)=f(1/\alpha). For certain values of the parameters these infinite products reduce to modular forms. Finite counterparts of these infinite products are motivated by solution of Dirichlet boundary problem on a rectangular grid. These finite product formulas give an elementary proof of several modular transformations.
