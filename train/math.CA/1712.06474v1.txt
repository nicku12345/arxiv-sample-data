In this work we study orthogonal polynomials via polynomial mappings in the framework of the H_q-semiclassical class. We consider two monic orthogonal polynomial sequences \{p_n (x)\}_{n\geq0} and \{q_n(x)\}_{n\geq0} such that  p_{kn}(x)=q_n(x^k)\;,\quad n=0,1,2,\ldots\;,  being k a fixed integer number such that k\geq2, and we prove that if one of the sequences \{p_n (x)\}_{n\geq0} or \{q_n(x)\}_{n\geq0} is H_q-semiclassical, then so is the other one. In particular, we show that if \{p_n(x)\}_{n\geq0} is H_q-semiclassical of class s\leq k-1, then \{q_n (x)\}_{n\geq0} is H_{q^k}-classical. This fact allows us to recover and extend recent results in the framework of cubic transformations, whenever we consider the above equality with k=3. The idea of blocks of recurrence relations introduced by Charris and Ismail plays a key role in our study.
