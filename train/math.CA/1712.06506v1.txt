In this paper, we introduce two new non-singular kernel fractional derivatives and present a class of other fractional derivatives derived from the new formulations. We present some important results of uniformly convergent sequences of continuous functions, in particular the Comparison's principle, and others that allow, the study of the limitation of fractional nonlinear differential equations.
