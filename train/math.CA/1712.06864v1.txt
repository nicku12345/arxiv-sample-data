The main goal of this paper is to reconsider a phenomenon which was treated in earlier work of the authors' on several truncated matricial moment problems. Using a special kind of Schur complement we obtain a more transparent insight into the nature of this phenomenon. In particular, a concrete general principle to describe it is obtained. This unifies an important aspect connected with truncated matricial moment problems.
