We study the problem of sampling with derivatives in shift-invariant spaces generated by totally-positive functions of Gaussian type or by the hyperbolic secant. We provide sharp conditions in terms of weighted Beurling densities. As a by-product we derive new results about multi-window Gabor frames with respect to vectors of Hermite functions or totally positive functions.
