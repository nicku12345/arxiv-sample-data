We develop a wide general theory of bilinear bi-parameter singular integrals T. First, we prove a dyadic representation theorem starting from T1 assumptions and apply it to show many estimates, including L^p \times L^q \to L^r estimates in the full natural range together with weighted estimates and mixed-norm estimates. Second, we develop commutator decompositions and show estimates in the full range for commutators and iterated commutators, like [b_1,T]_1 and [b_2, [b_1, T]_1]_2, where b_1 and b_2 are little BMO functions. Our proof method can be used to simplify and improve linear commutator proofs, even in the two-weight Bloom setting. We also prove commutator lower bounds by using and developing the recent median method.
