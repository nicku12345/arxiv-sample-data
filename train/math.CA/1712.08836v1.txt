A convolution operator in \mathbb{R}^d with kernel in L_q acts from L_p to L_s, where 1/p+1/q=1+1/s. The main theorem states that if 1<q,p,s<\infty, then there exists an L_p function of unit norm on which the s-norm of the convolution is attained. A number of questions, solved and open, related to the statement and proof of the main theorem, are discussed. The problem of computing best constants in the Hausdorff-Young inequality for the Laplace transform, which prompted this research, is considered.
