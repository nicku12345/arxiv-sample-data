In this note, we prove or re-prove several important results regarding one dimensional time fractional ODEs following our previous work \cite{fllx17}. Here we use the definition of Caputo derivative proposed in \cite{liliu17frac1,liliu2017} based on a convolution group. In particular, we establish generalized comparison principles consistent with the new definition of Caputo derivatives. In addition, we establish the full asymptotic behaviors of the solutions for D_c^{\gamma}u=Au^p. Lastly, we provide a simplified proof for the strict monotonicity and stability in initial values for the time fractional differential equations with weak assumptions.
