In this paper, we investigate the multilinear boundedness properties of the higher (n-th) order Calder\'on commutator for dimensions larger than two. We establish all multilinear endpoint estimates for the target space L^{\frac{d}{d+n},\infty}(\mathbb{R}^d), including that Calder\'on commutator maps the product of Lorentz spaces L^{d,1}(\mathbb{R}^d)\times\cdots\times L^{d,1}(\mathbb{R}^d)\times L^1(\mathbb{R}^d) to L^{\frac{d}{d+n},\infty}(\mathbb{R}^d), which is the higher dimensional nontrivial generalization of the endpoint estimate that the n-th order Calder\'on commutator maps L^{1}(\mathbb{R})\times\cdots\times L^{1}(\mathbb{R})\times L^1(\mathbb{R}) to L^{\frac{1}{1+n},\infty}(\mathbb{R}). When considering the target space L^{r}(\mathbb{R}^d) with r<\frac{d}{d+n}, some counterexamples are given to show that these multilinear estimates may not hold. The method in the present paper seems to have a wide range of applications and it can be applied to establish the similar results for Calder\'on commutator with a rough homogeneous kernel.
