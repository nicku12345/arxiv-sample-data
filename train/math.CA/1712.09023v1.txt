Let T be the \theta-type Calder\'on-Zgymund operator with Dini condition. In this paper, we prove that for b\in {\rm CMO}(\mathbb R^n), the commutator generated by T with b and the corresponding maximal commutator, are both compact operators on L^{p}(\omega) spaces, where \omega be the Muchenhoupt A_p weight function and 1<p<\infty.
