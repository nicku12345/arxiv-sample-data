In this paper, we studied the sufficient conditions for the existence of positive solutions to the boundary value problems of Caputo fractional difference equations depending on parameters with non local boundary conditions. We construct and analyse the Green's function to the corresponding boundary value problem and then established the existence results using Krasnosel'skii fixed point theorem.
