This is a survey on recent developments on the Hausdorff dimension of projections and intersections for general subsets of Euclidean spaces, with an emphasis on estimates of the Hausdorff dimension of exceptional sets and on restricted projection families. We shall also discuss relations between projections and Hausdorff dimension of Besicovitch sets.
