Fourier transformations of several functions of one and two variables are evaluated and then used to derive some integral and series identities. It is shown that certain double Mordell integrals can be reduced to a sum of products of one-dimensional Mordell integrals. As a consequence of this reduction, a quadratic polynomial identity is found connecting products of certain one-dimensional Mordell integrals. An integral that depends on one real valued parameter is calculated reminiscent of an integral previously calculated by Ramanujan and Glasser. Some connections to elliptic functions and lattice sums are discussed.
