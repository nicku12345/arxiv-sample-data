In this paper we investigate some convergence and divergence of some specific subsequences of partial sums with respect to Walsh system on the martingale Hardy spaces. By using these results we obtain relationship of the ratio of convergence of the partial sums of the Walsh series with the modulus of continuity of martingale. These conditions are in a sense necessary and sufficient.
