We introduce a new problem on the elementary symmetric polynomials \sigma_k, stemming from the constraint equations of some modified gravity theory. For which coefficients is a linear combination of \sigma_k 1/p-concave, with 0 \leq k \leq p? We establish connections between the 1/p-concavity and the real-rootedness of some polynomials built on the coefficients. We conjecture that if the restriction of the linear combination to the positive diagonal is a real-rooted polynomial, then the linear combination is 1/p-concave. Using the theory of hyperbolic polynomials, we show that this would be implied by a short algebraic statement: if the polynomials P and Q of degree n are real-rooted, then \sum_{k=0}^n P^{(k)}Q^{(n-k)} is real-rooted as well. This is not proven yet. We conjecture more generally that the global 1/p-concavity is equivalent to the 1/p-concavity on the positive diagonal. We prove all our guessings for p=2. The way is open for further developments.
