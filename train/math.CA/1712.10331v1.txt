The aim of this paper is to generalize the Hermite--Hadamard inequality for functions convex on the coordinates. Our composite result generalizes the result of Dragomir in \cite{Drag}. Many other interesting inequalities can be derived from our results by choosing different values of n\in\mathbb{N}. Furthermore, we add to the literature a new result for positive functions convex on the coordinates.
