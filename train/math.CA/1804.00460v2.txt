In this paper, Hardy type operator H_{\beta} on \bR^{n} and its adjoint operator H_{\beta}^{*} are investigated. We use novel methods to obtain two main results. One is that we obtain the operators H_{\beta} and H_{\beta}^{*} being bounded from L^{p}(|x|^{\alpha}) to L^{q,\infty}(|x|^{\gamma}), and the bounds of the operators H_{\beta} and H_{\beta}^{*} are sharp worked out. In particular, when \alpha=\gamma=0, the norm of H_{\beta} is equal to 1. The other is that we study limiting weak-type behavior for the operator H_{\beta} and its optimal form was obtained.
