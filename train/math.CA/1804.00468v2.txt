In this paper, we investigate a class of fractional Hardy type operators \mathscr{H}_{\beta_{1},\cdots,\beta_{m}} defined on higher-dimensional product spaces \mathbb{R}^{n_{1}}\times\mathbb{R}^{n_{2}}\times\cdots\times\mathbb{R}^{n_{m}}. We use novel methods to obtain two main results. One is that we obtain the operator \mathscr{H}_{\beta_{1},\cdots,\beta_{m}} is bounded from L^{p}(\mathbb{R}^{n_{1}}\times\mathbb{R}^{n_{2}}\times\cdots\times\mathbb{R}^{n_{m}},|x|^{\gamma}) to L^{q}(\mathbb{R}^{n_{1}}\times\mathbb{R}^{n_{2}}\times\cdots\times\mathbb{R}^{n_{m}},|x|^{\alpha}) and the bounds of the operator \mathscr{H}_{\beta_{1},\cdots,\beta_{m}} is sharp worked out. The other is that when \alpha=\gamma=(0,\cdots,0), the norm of the operator \mathscr{H}_{\beta_{1},\cdots,\beta_{m}} is obtained.
