We generalize classical Hobson's formula concerning partial derivatives of radial functions on a Euclidean space to a formula in the Dunkl analysis. As applications we give new simple proofs of known results involving Maxwell's representation of harmonic polynomials, Bochner-Hecke identity, Pizzetti formula for spherical mean, and Rodrigues formula for Hermite polynomials.
