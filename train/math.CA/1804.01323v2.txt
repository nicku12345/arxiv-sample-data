In this paper we present a systematic way to describe exceptional Jacobi polynomials via two partitions. We give the construction of these polynomials and restate the known aspects of these polynomials in terms of their partitions. The aim is to show that the use of partitions is an elegant way to label these polynomials. Moreover, we prove asymptotic results according to the regular and exceptional zeros of these polynomials.
