We investigate the recurrence coefficients of discrete orthogonal polynomials on the non-negative integers with hypergeometric weights and show that they satisfy a system of non-linear difference equations and a non-linear second order differential equation in one of the parameters of the weights. The non-linear difference equations form a pair of discrete Painlev\'e equations and the differential equation is the \sigma-form of the sixth Painlev\'e equation. We briefly investigate the asymptotic behavior of the recurrence coefficients as n\to \infty using the discrete Painlev\'e equations.
