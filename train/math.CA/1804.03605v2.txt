In this article, we prove that all global, nonendpoint Fourier restriction inequalities for the paraboloid in \mathbb R^{1+d} have extremizers and that L^p-normalized extremizing sequences are precompact modulo symmetries. This result had previously been established for the case q=2. In the range where the boundedness of the restriction operator is still an open question, our result is conditional on improvements toward the restriction conjecture.
