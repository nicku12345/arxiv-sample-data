Denote by \mathcal{P}_{\log} the set of all non-constant Pick functions f whose logarithmic derivatives f^{\, \prime}/f also belong to the Pick class. Let \mathcal{U}(\Lambda) be the family of functions z\cdot f(z), where f \in\mathcal{P}_{\log} and f is holomorphic on \Lambda:=\mathbb{C}\setminus [1, +\infty). Important examples of functions in \mathcal{U}(\Lambda) are the classical polylogarithms Li_\alpha(z) := \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} z^k / k^\alpha for \alpha \geq 0.   In this paper we prove that every \varphi \in \mathcal{U}(\Lambda) is universally starlike, i.e., \varphi maps every circular domain in \Lambda containing the origin one-to-one onto a starlike domain. Furthermore, we show that every non-constant function f \in \mathcal{P}_{\log} belongs to the Hardy space H_p on the upper half-plane for some constant p=p(f) > 1, unless f is proportional to some function (a-z)^{-\theta} with a \in \mathbb{R} and 0 < \theta \leq 1. Finally we derive a necessary and sufficient condition on a real-valued function v for which there exists f \in \mathcal{P}_{\log} such that v (x) = \lim_{\varepsilon \to 0} \mathrm{Im} f (x + i \varepsilon) for almost all x \in \mathbb{R}.
