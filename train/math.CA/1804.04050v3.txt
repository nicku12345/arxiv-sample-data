We show that if f is an integer-valued function with spectral norm at most M then there are subspaces V_1,\dots,V_L and signs \sigma_1,\dots,\sigma_L \in \{-1,1\} such that f=\sigma_1 1_{V_1} + \dots + \sigma_L 1_{V_L} where L < \exp(M^{3+o(1)}).   This note extracts out the argument from arXiv:1610.07092 to the model setting of \mathbb{F}_2^n. The hope is that it will clarify the arguments of that paper.
