Small non-autonomous perturbations around an equilibrium of a nonlinear delayed system are studied. Under appropriate assumptions, it is shown that the number of T-periodic solutions lying inside a bounded domain \Omega\subset \R^N is, generically, at least |\chi \pm 1|+1, where \chi denotes the Euler characteristic of \Omega. Moreover, some connections between the associated fixed point operator and the Poincar\'e operator are explored.
