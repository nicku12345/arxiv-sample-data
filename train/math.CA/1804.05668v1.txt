By BMO_o(R) we denote the space consisting of all those odd and bounded mean oscillation functions on R. In this paper we characterize the functions in BMO_o(R) with bounded support as those ones that can be written as a sum of a bounded function on (0,\infty ) plus the balayage of a Carleson measure on (0,\infty )\times (0,\infty ) with respect to the Poisson semigroup associated with the Bessel operator B_\lambda =-x^{-\lambda }Dx^{2\lambda }Dx^{-\lambda}, \lambda >0. This result can be seen as an extension to Bessel setting of a classical result due to Carleson.
