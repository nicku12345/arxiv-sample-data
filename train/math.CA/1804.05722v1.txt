For functions from the set of generalized Poisson integrals C^{\alpha,r}_{\beta}L_{p}, 1\leq p <\infty, we obtain upper estimates for the deviations of Fourier sums in the uniform metric in terms of the best approximations of the generalized derivatives f^{\alpha,r}_{\beta} of functions of this kind by trigonometric polynomials in the metric of the spaces L_{p}. Obtained estimates are asymptotically best possible.
