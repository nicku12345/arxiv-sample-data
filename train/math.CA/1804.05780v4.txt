In this note we give equivalent characterizations for a fractional Triebel-Lizorkin space F^s_{p,q}(\Omega) in terms of first-order differences in a uniform domain \Omega. The characterization is valid for any positive, non-integer real smoothness s\in \mathbb{R}_+\setminus \mathbb{N} and {indices 1\leq p<\infty, 1\leq q \leq \infty} as long as the fractional part \{s\} is greater than d/p-d/q.
