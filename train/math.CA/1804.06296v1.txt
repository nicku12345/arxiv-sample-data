We study the boundedness properties of commutators formed by b and T, where T is a bilinear bi-parameter singular integral satisfying natural T1 type conditions and b is a little BMO function. For paraproduct free bilinear bi-parameter singular integrals T we prove that [b, T]_1 \colon L^p(\mathbb{R}^{n+m}) \times L^q(\mathbb{R}^{n+m}) \to L^r(\mathbb{R}^{n+m}) in the full range 1 < p, q \le \infty, 1/2 < r < \infty satisfying 1/p+1/q = 1/r. A special case is when T is a bilinear bi-parameter multiplier. We also prove the corresponding Banach range result for all singular integrals satisfying the T1 type conditions. In doing so we simplify the corresponding linear proof. Lastly, we prove analogous results for iterated commutators.
