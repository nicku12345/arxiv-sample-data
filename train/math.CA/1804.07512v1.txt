We investigate type I multiple orthogonal polynomials on r intervals which have a common point at the origin and endpoints at the r roots of unity \omega^j, j=0,1,\ldots,r-1, with \omega = \exp(2\pi i/r). We use the weight function |x|^\beta (1-x^r)^\alpha, with \alpha,\beta >-1 for the multiple orthogonality relations. We give explicit formulas for the type I multiple orthogonal polynomials, the coefficients in the recurrence relation, the differential equation, and we obtain the asymptotic distribution of the zeros.
