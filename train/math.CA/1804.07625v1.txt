In the paper we investigate continuity of Orlicz-Sobolev mappings W^{1,P}(M,N) of finite distortion between smooth Riemannian n-manifolds, n\geq 2, under the assumption that the Young function P satisfies the so called divergence condition \int_1^\infty P(t)/t^{n+1}\, dt=\infty. We prove that if the manifolds are oriented, N is compact, and the universal cover of N is not a rational homology sphere, then such mappings are continuous. That includes mappings with Df\in L^n and, more generally, mappings with Df\in L^n\log^{-1}L. On the other hand, if the space W^{1,P} is larger than W^{1,n} (for example if Df\in L^n\log^{-1}L), and the universal cover of N is homeomorphic to \mathbb{S}^n, n\neq 4, or is diffeomorphic to \mathbb{S}^n, n=4, then we construct an example of a mapping in W^{1,P}(M,N) that has finite distortion and is discontinuous. This demonstrates a new global-to-local phenomenon: both finite distortion and continuity are local properties, but a seemingly local fact that finite distortion implies continuity is a consequence of a global topological property of the target manifold N.
