In this paper we give an attempt to extend some arithmetic properties such as multiplicativity, convolution products to the setting of operators theory. We provide a significant examples which are of interest in number theory. We also give a representation of the Euler differential operator by means of the Euler totient arithmetic function and idempotent elements of some associative unital algebra.
