Consider a differential system of the form  x'=F_0(t,x)+\sum_{i=1}^k \varepsilon^i F_i(t,x)+\varepsilon^{k+1} R(t,x,\varepsilon),  where F_i:\mathbb{S}^1 \times D \to \mathbb{R}^m and R:\mathbb{S}^1 \times D \times (-\varepsilon_0,\varepsilon_0) \to \mathbb{R}^m are piecewise C^{k+1} functions and T-periodic in the variable t. Assuming that the unperturbed system x'=F_0(t,x) has a d-dimensional submanifold of periodic solutions with d<m, we use the Lyapunov-Schmidt reduction and the averaging theory to study the existence of isolated T-periodic solutions of the above differential system.
