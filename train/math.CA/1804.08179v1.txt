We study the bifurcation of limit cycles from the periodic orbits of 2n--dimensional linear centers \dot{x} = A_0 x when they are perturbed inside classes of continuous and discontinuous piecewise linear differential systems of control theory of the form \dot{x} = A_0 x + \varepsilon \big(A x + \phi(x_1) b\big), where \phi is a continuous or discontinuous piecewise linear function, A_0 is a 2n\times 2n matrix with only purely imaginary eigenvalues, \varepsilon is a small parameter, A is an arbitrary 2n\times 2n matrix, and b is an arbitrary vector of \mathbb{R}^n.
