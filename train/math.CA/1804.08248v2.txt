We prove that several forms of the Bernstein polynomials with integer coefficients possess the property of simultaneous approximation, that is, they approximate not only the function but also its derivatives. We establish direct estimates of the error of that approximation in uniform norm by means of moduli of smoothness. Moreover, we show that the sufficient conditions under which those estimates hold are also necessary.
