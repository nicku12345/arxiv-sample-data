We initiate the theory of \ell^p-improving inequalities for arithmetic averages over hypersurfaces and their maximal functions. In particular, we prove \ell^p-improving estimates for the discrete spherical averages and some of their generalizations. As an application of our \ell^p-improving inequalities for the dyadic discrete spherical maximal function, we give a new estimate for the full discrete spherical maximal function in four dimensions. Our proofs are analogous to Littman's result on Euclidean spherical averages. One key aspect of our proof is a Littlewood--Paley decomposition in both the arithmetic and analytic aspects. In the arithmetic aspect this is a major arc-minor arc decomposition of the circle method.
