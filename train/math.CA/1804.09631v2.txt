In this paper we prove the sharp boundedness for a fractional type operator given by a kernel that satisfy a L^{\alpha,r'}-H\"ormander conditions and a fractional size condition, where 0<\alpha<n and 1< r'\leq \infty. To prove this result we use a new appropriate sparse domination which we provide in this work. For the case r'=\infty we recover the sharp boundedness for the fractional integral, I_{\alpha}, proved in [Lacey, M. T., Moen, K., P\'erez, C., Torres, R. H. (2010). Sharp weighted bounds for fractional integral operators. Journal of Functional Analysis, 259(5), 1073-1097.]
