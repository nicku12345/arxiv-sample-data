Let  \lambda ^2 \in \mathbb N , and in dimensions  d\geq 5, let  A_{\lambda } f (x) denote the average of  f \;:\; \mathbb Z ^{d} \to \mathbb R  over the lattice points on the sphere of radius \lambda centered at x. We prove  \ell ^{p} improving properties of  A_{\lambda }. \begin{equation*} \lVert A_{\lambda }\rVert_{\ell ^{p} \to \ell ^{p'}} \leq C_{d,p, \omega (\lambda ^2 )} \lambda ^{d ( 1-\frac{2}p)}, \qquad \tfrac{d-1}{d+1} < p \leq \frac{d} {d-2}. \end{equation*} It holds in dimension  d =4 for odd  \lambda ^2 . The dependence is in terms of  \omega (\lambda ^2 ), the number of distinct prime factors of  \lambda ^2 . These inequalities are discrete versions of a classical inequality of Littman and Strichartz on the  L ^{p} improving property of spherical averages on  \mathbb R ^{d}, in particular they are scale free, in a natural sense. The proof uses the decomposition of the corresponding multiplier whose properties were established by Magyar-Stein-Wainger, and Magyar. We then use a proof strategy of Bourgain, which dominates each part of the decomposition by an endpoint estimate.
