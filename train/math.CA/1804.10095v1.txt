In this paper we study the commutators of fractional type integral operators. This operators are given by kernels of theform K(x,y)=k_1(x-A_1y)k_2(x-A_2y)\dots k_m(x-A_my), where A_i are invertibles matrices and each k_i satisfies a fractional size condition and generalized fractional H\"ormander condition. We obtain weighted Coifman estimates, weighted L^p(w^p) - L^q(w^q) estimates and weighted BMO estimates. We also give a two weight strong estimate for pair of weights of the form (u,Su) where u is an arbitrary non-negative function and S is a maximal operator depending on the smoothness of the kernel K. For the singular case we also give a two-weighted endpoint estimate.
