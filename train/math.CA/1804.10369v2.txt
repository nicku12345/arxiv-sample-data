For the Schlesinger-type equation related to the fifth Painlev\'e equation (V) via isomonodromy deformation, we present a three-parameter family of matrix solutions along the imaginary axis near the point at infinity, and also the corresponding monodromy data. Two-parameter solutions of (V) with their monodromy data immediately follow from our results. Under certain conditions, these solutions of (V) admit sequences of zeros and of poles along the imaginary axis. The monodromy data are obtained by matching techniques for a perturbed linear system.
