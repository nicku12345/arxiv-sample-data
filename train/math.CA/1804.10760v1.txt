A survey of results on Lyapunov-type inequalities for fractional differential equations associated with a variety of boundary conditions is presented. This includes Dirichlet, mixed, Robin, fractional, Sturm-Liouville, integral, nonlocal, multi-point, anti-periodic, conjugate, right-focal and impulsive conditions. Furthermore, our study includes Riemann-Liouville, Caputo, Hadamard, Prabhakar, Hilfer and conformable type fractional derivatives. Results for boundary value problems involving fractional p-Laplacian, fractional operators with nonsingular Mittag-Leffler kernels, q-difference, discrete, and impulsive equations, are also taken into account.
