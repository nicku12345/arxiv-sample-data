In this work, we introduce a new family of d-orthogonal polynomials of Meixner type, which are also a special family of multiple orthogonal polynomials. We show that they are matrix elements of a suitable nonlinear operator related to the Lie algebra \mathfrak{su}(1,1). Also by means of Barut-Girardello coherent states, we establish explicitly their principal properties ( recurrence relation, generating function, d-orthogonality relations, etc).
