In this paper we prove some monotonicity, log--convexity and log--concavity properties for the Volterra and incomplete Volterra functions. Moreover, as consequences of these results, we present some functional inequalities (like Tur\'an type inequalities) as well as we determined sharp upper and lower bounds for the normalized incomplete Volterra functions in terms of weighted power means.
