In this paper, we discuss a similar functional to that of a standard integral. The main difference is in its definition: instead of taking a sum, we are taking a product. It turns out this new "star-integral" may be written in terms of the standard integral but it has many different (and similar) interesting properties compared to the regular integral. Further, we define a "star-derivative" and discuss its relationship to the "star-integral".
