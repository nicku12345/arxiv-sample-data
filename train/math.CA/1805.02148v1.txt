In this paper, we obtain analytical solution of an unsolved integral \textbf{R}_{C}(m,n) of Srinivasa Ramanujan [\textit{Mess. Math}., XLIV, 75-86, 1915], using hypergeometric approach, Mellin transforms, Infinite Fourier cosine transforms, Infinite series decomposition identity and some algebraic properties of Pochhammer's symbol. Also we have given some generalizations of the Ramanujan's integral \textbf{R}_{C}(m,n) in the form of integrals \textbf{I}^{*}_{C}(\upsilon,b,c,\lambda,y), \textbf{J}_C (\upsilon,b,c,\lambda,y), \textbf{K}_{C} (\upsilon,b,c, \lambda,y), \textbf{I}_{C}(\upsilon,b,\lambda,y) and solved it in terms of ordinary hypergeometric functions {}_2 F_3, with suitable convergence conditions. Moreover as applications of Ramanujan's integral \textbf{R}_{C}(m,n), the new nine infinite summation formulas associated with hypergeometric functions {}_{0}F_{1}, {}_{1}F_{2} and {}_{2}F_{3} are obtained.
