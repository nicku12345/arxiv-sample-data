Let \alpha\in\,]0,1[. We prove that the existence of the conformable fractional derivative T_{\alpha}f of a function f:[0,\infty[\,\longrightarrow \mathbb{R} introduced by Khalil et al. in [R. Khalil, M. Al Horani, A. Yousef, M. Sababheh, A new definition of fractional derivative, J. Comput. Appl. Math. 264 (2014) 65-70] is equivalent to classical differentiability. Precisely the fractional \alpha-derivative of f is the pointwise product T_{\alpha}f(x)=x^{1-\alpha}f^{\prime}(x), x>0. This simplifies the recent results concerning conformable fractional calculus.
