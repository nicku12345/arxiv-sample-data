The main result of this paper is, that if we suppose that a function is absolutely continuous and uniformly H\"older continuous and that it's finite difference function does not oscillate infinitely often on a bounded interval, then the decay rate of its Fourier coefficients can be estimated exactly. This rate of decay predicts the same uniform H\"older continuity but the two other conditions are not necessary. Several examples from literature and by the author show that none of the assumptions can be relaxed without weakening the decay for some functions. The uniform H\"older continuity of chirps and the decay of their Fourier coefficients and Fourier transforms are studied thoroughly.
