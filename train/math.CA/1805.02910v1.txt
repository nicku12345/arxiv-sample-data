The Basener-Ross system is a known model in Population Dynamics for the interaction of consumers and resources in an isolated habitat. For an extended version with time-dependent coefficients as a model of possible variations of the environtmental conditions, some relations among the coefficients are provided leading to the integrability of the system.
