Given a closed invariant set \mathcal{C} of a dynamical system generated by a smooth vector field, X, for each \lambda > 0, we construct a control vector field, X_{0}^{\lambda}, such that the perturbed dynamics generated by the vector field X+X_{0}^{\lambda}, globally asymptotically bp-stabilizes the invariant set \mathcal{C}, that is, \mathcal{C} attracts every bounded positive orbit of the perturbed dynamical system.
