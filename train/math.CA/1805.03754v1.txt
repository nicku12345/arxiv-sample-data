For \mathbb B^n the unit ball of \mathbb C^n, we consider Bergman-Orlicz spaces of holomorphic functions in L^\Phi_\alpha(\mathbb B^n), which are generalizations of classical Bergman spaces. We obtain atomic decomposition for functions in the Bergman-Orlicz space \mathcal A^\Phi_\alpha (\mathbb B^n) where \Phi is either convex or concave growth function. We then prove weak factorization theorems involving the Bloch space and a Bergman-Orlicz space and also weak factorization theorems involving two Bergman-Orlicz spaces.
