In [Bull. Acad. Polon. Sci. S\'{e}r. Sci. Math. 29 (1981), no.~7-8, 367--370], Philos proved the following result: Let f:[t_{0},\infty)_{\mathbb{R}}\to\mathbb{R} be an n-times differentiable function such that f^{(n)}(t)\leq0 (\not\equiv0) and f(t)>0 for all t\geq{}t_{0}. If f is unbounded, then f(t)\geq\frac{\lambda{}t^{n-1}}{(n-1)!}f^{(n-1)}(t) for all sufficiently large t, where \lambda\in(0,1)_{\mathbb{R}}. In this work, we first present time scales unification of this result. Then, by using it, we provide sufficient conditions for oscillation and asymptotic behaviour of solutions to higher-order neutral dynamic equations.
