We present two results on generalized Darboux properties of additive real functions.   The first results deals with a weak continuity property, called {\bf Q}-continuity, shared by all additive functions. We show that every {\bf Q}-continuous function is the uniform limit of a sequence of Darboux functions. The class of {\bf Q}-continuous functions includes the class of Jensen convex functions. We discuss further connections with related concepts, such as {\bf Q}-differentiability.   Next, given a {\bf Q}-vector space A\subseteq {\bf R} of cardinality {\bf c} we consider the class {\cal DH}^{*}(A) of additive functions such that for every interval I\subseteq {\bf R}, f(I)=A. We show that every function in class {\cal DH}^{*}(A) can be written as the sum of a linear (additive continuous) function and an additive function with the Darboux property if and only if A={\bf R}. We apply this result to obtain a relativization of a certain hierarchy of real functions to the class of additive functions.
