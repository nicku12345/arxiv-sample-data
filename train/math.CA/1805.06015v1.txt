In this paper, we investigate the existence and uniqueness of solutions for a fractional boundary value problem supplemented with nonlocal Riemann-Liouville fractional integral and Caputo fractional derivative boundary conditions. Our results are based on some known tools of fixed point theory. Finally, some illustrative examples are included to verify the validity of our results.
