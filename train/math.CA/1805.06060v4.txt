We prove endpoint-type sparse bounds for Walsh-Fourier Marcinkiewicz multipliers and Littlewood-Paley square functions. These results are motivated by conjectures of Lerner in the Fourier setting. As a corollary, we obtain novel quantitative weighted norm inequalities for these operators. Among these, we establish the sharp growth rate of the L^p weighted operator norm in terms of the A_p characteristic in the full range 1<p<\infty for Walsh-Littlewood-Paley square functions, and a restricted range for Marcinkiewicz multipliers. Zygmund's L{(\log L)^{{\frac12}}} inequality is the core of our lacunary multi-frequency projection proof. We use the Walsh setting to avoid extra complications in the arguments.
