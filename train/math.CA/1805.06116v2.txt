Given f \in C_0(\mathbb{R}^n) and \Lambda \subset \mathbb{R}^{2n} a finite set we demonstrate the linear independence of the set of time-frequency translates \mathcal{G}(f, \Lambda) = \{\pi(\lambda)f\}_{\lambda\in \Lambda} when the time coordinates of points in \Lambda are far apart relative to the decay of f. As a corollary, we prove that for any f \in C_0(\mathbb{R}^n) and finite \Lambda \subset \mathbb{R}^{2n} there exist infinitely many dilations D_r such that \mathcal{G}(D_rf, \Lambda) is linearly independent. Furthermore, we prove that \mathcal{G}(f, \Lambda) is linearly independent for functions like f(t) = \frac{cos(t)}{|t|} which have a singularity and are bounded away from any neighborhood of the singularity.
