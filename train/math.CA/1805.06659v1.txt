We investigate the existence, non-existence, multiplicity of positive periodic solutions, both harmonic (i.e., T-periodic) and subharmonic (i.e., kT-periodic for some integer k \geq 2) to the equation \begin{equation*} \Biggl{(} \dfrac{u'}{\sqrt{1-(u')^{2}}} \Biggr{)}' + \lambda a(t) g(u) = 0, \end{equation*} where \lambda > 0 is a parameter, a(t) is a T-periodic sign-changing weight function and g \colon \mathopen{[}0,+\infty\mathclose{[} \to \mathopen{[}0,+\infty\mathclose{[} is a continuous function having superlinear growth at zero. In particular, we prove that for both g(u)=u^{p}, with p>1, and g(u)= u^{p}/(1+u^{p-q}), with 0 \leq q \leq 1 < p, the equation has no positive T-periodic solutions for \lambda close to zero and two positive T-periodic solutions (a 'small' one and a 'large' one) for \lambda large enough. Moreover, in both cases the 'small' T-periodic solution is surrounded by a family of positive subharmonic solutions with arbitrarily large minimal period. The proof of the existence of T-periodic solutions relies on a recent extension of Mawhin's coincidence degree theory for locally compact operators in product of Banach spaces, while subharmonic solutions are found by an application of the Poincar\'e--Birkhoff fixed point theorem, after a careful asymptotic analysis of the T-periodic solutions for \lambda \to +\infty.
