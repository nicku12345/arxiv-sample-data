We show how to obtain linear combinations of polynomials in an orthogonal sequence \{P_n\}_{n\geq 0}, such as Q_{n,k}(x)=\sum\limits_{i=0}^k a_{n,i}P_{n-i}(x), a_{n,0}a_{n,k}\neq0, that characterize quasi-orthogonal polynomials of order k\le n-1. The polynomials in the sequence \{Q_{n,k}\}_{n\geq 0} are obtained from P_{n}, by making use of parameter shifts. We use an algorithmic approach to find these linear combinations for each family applicable and these equations are used to prove quasi-orthogonality of order k. We also determine the location of the extreme zeros of the quasi-orthogonal polynomials with respect to the end points of the interval of orthogonality of the sequence \{P_n\}_{n\geq 0}, where possible.
