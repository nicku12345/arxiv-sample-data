We derive a generalized Rogers generating function and corresponding definite integral, for the continuous q-ultraspherical polynomials by applying its connection relation and utilizing orthogonality. Using a recent generalization of the Rogers generating function by Ismail & Simeonov expanded in terms of Askey-Wilson polynomials, we derive corresponding generalized expansions for the continuous q-Jacobi, and Wilson polynomials with two and four free parameters respectively. Comparing the coefficients of the Askey-Wilson expansion to our continuous q-ultraspherical/Rogers expansion, we derive a new quadratic transformation for basic hypergeometric series connecting {}_2\phi_1 and {}_8\phi_7.
