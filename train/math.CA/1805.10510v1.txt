We describe the Bellman function technique for proving sharp inequalities in harmonic analysis. To provide an example along with historical context, we present how it was originally used by Donald Burkholder to prove L^p boundedness of the \pm 1 martingale transform. Finally, with Burkholder's result as a blueprint, we use the Bellman function to prove a new result related to the Chang-Wilson-Wolff Inequality.
