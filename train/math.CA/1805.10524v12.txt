We introduce the \emph{\varphi\mathbb{A}-differentiability} for functions f:U\subset \mathbb R^{k}\to\mathbb A where \mathbb A is the linear space \mathbb R^{n} endowed with an algebra product which is unital, associative, commutative, U is an open set, and \varphi:U\subset \mathbb R^{k}\to\mathbb A is a differentiable function in the usual sense. We also introduce the corresponding generalized Cauchy-Riemann equations (\varphi\mathbb{A}-CREs), the Cauchy-integral theorem, and the \emph{\varphi\mathbb A-differential equations}. The four-dimensional vector fields associated with triangular billiards are \varphi\mathbb{A}-differentiable. The \emph{\varphi\mathbb A-differential equations} can be used for constructing exact solutions of partial differential equations like the three-dimensional heat equation.
