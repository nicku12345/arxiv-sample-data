The article examines isotropic Nikolskii and Besov spaces with norms defined using L_p-averaged modulus of continuity of functions of appropriate order, instead of modulus of continuity of known order for fixed-order partial derivative functions. The author builds continuous linear mappings of such spaces of functions defined in domains of (1,\ldots,1)-type (in a broad sense) to ordinary isotropic Nikolskii and Besov spaces in  \mathbb R^d  that are function extension operators, thus incurring coincidence of both kinds of spaces in the said domains. It is established that every bounded domain in  \mathbb R^d  with a Lipschitzian boundary is a (1,\ldots,1)-type domain (in a broad sense). The article also provides weak asymptotics of approximation characteristics related to the problem of reconstruction of functions with their derivatives from function values at a given number of points, the S.B.Stechkin's problem for differential operator, and the problem of width asymptotics for isotropic Nikolskii-Besov classes in those domains.
