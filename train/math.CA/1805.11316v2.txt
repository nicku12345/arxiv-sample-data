In this paper we define an internal binary operation between functions called in the text \emph{fractal convolution}, that applies a pair of mappings into a fractal function. This is done by means of a suitable Iterated Function System. We study in detail the operation in \mathcal{L}^p spaces and in sets of continuous functions, in a different way to previous works of the authors. We develop some properties of the operation and its associated sets. The lateral convolutions with the null function provide linear operators whose characteristics are explored. The last part of the article deals with the construction of convolved fractals bases and frames in Banach and Hilbert spaces of functions.
