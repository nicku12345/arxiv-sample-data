The generalized summation of divergent trigonometric series, namely by method of \sigma_k(r,a)-factors is considered in this paper. It is proved that such summation of Fourier series of periodical function f(t) results in the convolution of this function with kernels De(r,\alpha,t); if the parameter r is integer, these kernels are polynomial normalized basic B-splines of order r-1 (r=1,2,\ldots). Also it is proved that the method of summation with \sigma_k(r,a)-factors is F-effective.
