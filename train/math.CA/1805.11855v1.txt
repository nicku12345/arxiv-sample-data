We present a rational extension of Newton diagram for the positivity of {}_1F_2 generalized hypergeometric functions. As an application, we give upper and lower bounds for the transcendental roots \beta(\alpha) of \begin{align*} \int_0^{j_{\alpha, 2}} t^{-\beta} J_\alpha(t) dt = 0\qquad(-1<\alpha\le 1/2), \end{align*} where j_{\alpha, 2} denotes the second positive zero of Bessel function J_\alpha.
