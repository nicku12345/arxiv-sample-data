In this paper we study Hardy spaces \mathcal{H}^{p,q}(\mathbb{R}^d), 0<p,q<\infty, modeled over amalgam spaces (L^p,\ell^q)(\mathbb{R}^d). We characterize \mathcal{H}^{p,q}(\mathbb{R}^d) by using first order classical Riesz transforms and compositions of first order Riesz transforms depending on the values of the exponents p and q. Also, we describe the distributions in \mathcal{H}^{p,q}(\mathbb{R}^d) as the boundary values of solutions of harmonic and caloric Cauchy-Riemann systems. We remark that caloric Cauchy-Riemann systems involve fractional derivative in the time variable. Finally we characterize the functions in L^2(\mathbb{R}^d) \cap \mathcal{H}^{p,q}(\mathbb{R}^d) by means of Fourier multipliers m_\theta with symbol \theta(\cdot/|\cdot|), where \theta \in C^\infty(\mathbb{S}^{d-1}) and \mathbb{S}^{d-1} denotes the unit sphere in \mathbb{R}^d.
