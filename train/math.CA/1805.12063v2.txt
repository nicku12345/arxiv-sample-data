In this paper, we construct a subset of \mathbb{R}^d which asymptotically and omnidirectionally contains arithmetic progressions but has Assouad dimension 1. More precisely, we say that F asymptotically and omnidirectionally contains arithmetic progressions if we can find an arithmetic progression of length k and gap length \Delta>0 with direction e\in S^{d-1} inside the \epsilon \Delta neighbourhood of F for all \epsilon>0, k\geq 3 and e\in S^{d-1}. Moreover, the dimension of our constructed example is the lowest-possible because we prove that a subset of \mathbb{R}^d which asymptotically and omnidirectionally contains arithmetic progressions must have Assouad dimension greater than or equal to 1. We also get the same results for arithmetic patches, which are the higher dimensional extension of arithmetic progressions.
