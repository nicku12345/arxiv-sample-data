Suppose \Lambda is a discrete infinite set of nonnegative real numbers. We say that  {\Lambda} is type 1 if the series s(x)=\sum_{\lambda\in\Lambda}f(x+\lambda) satisfies a zero-one law. This means that for any non-negative measurable f: {{\mathbb R}}\to [0,+ {\infty}) either the convergence set C(f, {\Lambda})=\{x: s(x)<+ {\infty} \}= {{\mathbb R}} modulo sets of Lebesgue zero, or its complement the divergence set D(f, {\Lambda})=\{x: s(x)=+ {\infty} \}= {{\mathbb R}} modulo sets of measure zero.   If  {\Lambda} is not type 1 we say that  {\Lambda} is type 2.   The exact characterization of type 1 and type 2 sets is not known. In this paper we continue our study of the properties of type 1 and 2 sets. We discuss sub and supersets of type 1 and 2 sets and we give a complete and simple characterization of a subclass of dyadic type 1 sets. We discuss the existence of type 1 sets containing infinitely many algebraically independent elements. Finally, we consider unions and Minkowski sums of type 1 and 2 sets.
