In the last decades, the theory of digamma function has been developed with a high impact of interest by many authors. Here, we established some interesting results for digamma function, and also we have computed the values of digamma function for positive integers, using the concept of hypergeometric series. An attempt has been made to present some summation theorems for Clausen's hypergeometric function. Results presented here are potentially useful in the further study of digamma function.
