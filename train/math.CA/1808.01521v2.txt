Here we present some compliments to theorems of Gerard and Sibuya, on the convergence of multivariate formal power series solutions of nonlinear meromorphic Pfaffian systems. Their the most known results concern completely integrable systems with nondegenerate linear parts, whereas we consider some cases of non-integrability and degeneracy.
