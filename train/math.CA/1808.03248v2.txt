We prove that for any L^Q-valued Schwartz function f defined on \mathbb{R}^d, one has the multiple vector-valued, mixed norm estimate  \| f \|_{L^P(L^Q)} \lesssim \| S f \|_{L^P(L^Q)}  valid for every d-tuple P and every n-tuple Q satisfying 0 < P, Q < \infty componentwise. Here S:= S_{d_1}\otimes ... \otimes S_{d_N} is a tensor product of several Littlewood-Paley square functions S_{d_j} defined on arbitrary Euclidean spaces \mathbb{R}^{d_j} for 1\leq j\leq N, with the property that d_1 + ... + d_N = d. This answers a question that came up implicitly in our recent works and completes in a natural way classical results of the Littlewood-Paley theory. The proof is based on the \emph{helicoidal method} introduced by the authors.
