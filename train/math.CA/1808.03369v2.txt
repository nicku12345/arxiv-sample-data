The Dunkl operators associated to a dihedral group are a pair of differential-difference operators that generate a commutative algebra acting on differentiable functions in \mathbb{R}^2. The intertwining operator intertwines between this algebra and the algebra of differential operators. The main result of this paper is an integral representation of the intertwining operator on a class of functions. As an application, closed formulas for the Poisson kernels of h-harmonics and sieved Gegenbauer polynomials are deduced when one of the variables is at vertices of a regular polygon, and similar formulas are also derived for several other related families of orthogonal polynomials.
