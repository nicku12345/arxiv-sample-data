In this paper, we prove the boundedness of matrix Hausdorff operators and rough Hausdorff operators in the two weighted Herz-type Hardy spaces associated with both power weights and Muckenhoupt weights. By applying the fact that the standard infinite atomic decomposition norm on two weighted Herz-type Hardy spaces is equivalent to the finite atomic norm on some dense subspaces of them, we generalize some previous known results due to Chen et al. [7] and Ruan, Fan [34].
