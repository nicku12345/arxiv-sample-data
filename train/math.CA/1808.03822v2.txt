This note presents an example of an increasing sequence (\lambda_l)_{l=1}^\infty such that the maximal operators associated to normalized discrete spherical convolution averages \[ \sup_{l\geq 1}\frac{1}{r(\lambda_l)}\left|\sum_{|x|^2=\lambda_l}f(y-x)\right|\] for functions f:\mathbb{Z}^n\to\mathbb{C}^n are bounded on \ell^p for all p>1 when the ambient dimension n is at least five.
