The existence of sufficiently many finite order meromorphic solutions of a differential equation, or difference equation, or differential-difference equation, appears to be a good indicator of integrability. In this paper, we investigate the nonlinear differential-difference equations of form \begin{equation*} f(z)^{n}+L(z,f)=q(z)e^{p(z)},\eqno(*) \end{equation*} where n\geq 2, L(z,f)(\not\equiv 0) is a linear differential-difference polynomial in f(z), with small functions as its coefficients, p(z) and q(z) are non-vanishing polynomials. We first obtain that n=2 and f(z) satisfies \overline{\lambda}(f)=\sigma(f)=\deg p(z) under the assumption that the equation (*) possesses a transcendental entire solution of hyper order \sigma_{2}(f)<1. Furthermore, we give the exact form of the solutions of equation (*) when p(z)=a, q(z)=b, \eta are constants and L(z,f)=g(z)f(z+\eta)+h(z)f^{'}(z)+u(z)f(z)+v(z) is a linear differential-difference polynomial in f(z) with polynomial coefficients g(z), h(z), u(z) and v(z) such that L(z,f)\not\equiv 0 and a b \eta\neq 0.
