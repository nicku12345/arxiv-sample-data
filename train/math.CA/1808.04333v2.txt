We study mixed weak estimates of Sawyer type for maximal operators associated to the family of Young functions \Phi(t)=t^r(1+\log^+t)^{\delta}, where r\geq 1 and \delta\geq 0. More precisely, if u and v^r are A_1 weights, and w is defined as w=1/\Phi(v^{-1}) then the following estimate \[uw\left(\left\{x\in \mathbb{R}^n: \frac{M_\Phi(fv)(x)}{v(x)} > t\right\}\right) \leq C\int_{\mathbb{R}^n} \Phi\left(\frac{|f(x)|v(x)}{t}\right)u(x) \,dx\] holds for every positive t. This extends mixed estimates to a wider class of maximal operators, since when we put r=1 and \delta=0 we recover a previous result for the Hardy-Littlewood maximal operator. This inequality generalizes some previous results proved by Cruz Uribe, Martell and P\'erez in (Int. Math. Res. Not. (30): 1849-1871, 2005). Moreover, it includes estimates for some maximal operators related with commutators of Calder\'on-Zygmund operators.
