Algebraic hypergeometric functions can be compactly expressed as radical functions on pull-back curves where the monodromy group is simpler, say, a finite cyclic group. These so-called Darboux evaluations were already considered for algebraic 2F1-functions. This article presents Darboux evaluations for the classical case of 3F2-functions with the projective monodromy group PSL(2,F7). As an application, appealing modular evaluations of the same 3F2-functions are derived.
