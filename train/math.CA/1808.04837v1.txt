We introduce a natural method of computing antiderivatives of a large class of functions which stems from the observation that the series expansion of an antiderivative differs from the series expansion of the corresponding integrand by just two Pochhammer symbols. All antiderivatives are thus, in a sense, "hypergeometric". And hypergeometric functions are therefore the most natural functions to integrate. This paper would like to make two points: First, the method presented is easy. So much so that it can be taught in undergraduate university level. And second: It may be used to prove some of the more challenging examples computed only by heuristic processes like Method of brackets.
