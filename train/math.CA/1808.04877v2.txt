The Floquet eigenvalue problem and a generalized form of the Wangerin eigenvalue problem for Lam\'e's differential equation are discussed. Results include comparison theorems for eigenvalues and analytic continuation, zeros and limiting cases of (generalized) Lam\'e-Wangerin eigenfunctions. Algebraic Lam\'e functions and Lam\'e polynomials appear as special cases of Lam\'e-Wangerin functions.
