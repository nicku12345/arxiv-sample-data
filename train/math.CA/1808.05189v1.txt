In this paper, we are interested in the following bilinear fractional integral operator B\mathcal{I}_\alpha defined by   \[ B\mathcal{I}_{\alpha}({f,g})(x)=\int_{% %TCIMACRO{\U{211d} }% %BeginExpansion \mathbb{R} %EndExpansion ^{n}}\frac{f(x-y)g(x+y)}{|y|^{n-\alpha}}dy, \] with 0< \alpha<n. We prove the weighted boundedness of B\mathcal{I}_\alpha on the Morrey type spaces. Moreover, an Olsen type inequality for B\mathcal{I}_\alpha is also given.
