For 2\leq p<\infty, \alpha'>2/p, and \delta>0, we construct Cantor-type measures on \mathbb{R} supported on sets of Hausdorff dimension \alpha<\alpha' for which the associated maximal operator is bounded from L^p_\delta (\mathbb{R}) to L^p(\mathbb{R}). Maximal theorems for fractal measures on the line were previously obtained by Laba and Pramanik. The result here is weaker in that we are not able to obtain L^p estimates; on the other hand, our approach allows Cantor measures that are self-similar, have arbitrarily low dimension \alpha>0, and have no Fourier decay. The proof is based on a decoupling inequality similar to that of Laba and Wang.
