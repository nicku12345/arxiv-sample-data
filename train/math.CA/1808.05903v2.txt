We prove that a continuous path with finite length in a real Banach space cannot have infinitely many zero components in its signature unless it is tree-like. In particular, this allows us to strengthen a limit theorem for signature recently proved by Chang, Lyons and Ni. What lies at the heart of our proof is a complexification idea together with deep results from holomorphic polynomial approximations in the theory of several complex variables.
