Let K be a non-polar compact subset of \mathbb{C} and \mu_K be its equilibrium measure. Let \mu be a unit Borel measure supported on a compact set which contains the support of \mu_K. We prove that a Szeg\H{o} condition in terms of the Radon-Nikodym derivative of \mu with respect to \mu_K implies that \inf_n \frac{\|P_n(\cdot;\mu)\|_{L^2(\mathbb{C};\mu)}}{\mathrm{Cap}(K)^n}>0.   We show that \frac{\|P_n(\cdot;\mu_K)\|_{L^2(\mathbb{C};\mu_K)}}{\mathrm{Cap}(K)^n}\geq 1 for any compact non-polar set K. We also prove that under an additional assumption, unboundedness of the sequence \left(\frac{\|P_n(\cdot;\mu_K)\|_{L^2(\mathbb{C};\mu_K)}}{\mathrm{Cap}(K)^n}\right) implies that K satisfies the Parreau-Widom condition.
