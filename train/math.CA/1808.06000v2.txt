Interpolation inequalities play an important role in the study of PDEs and their applications. There are still some interesting open questions and problems that related to integral estimates and regularity of solutions to the elliptic and/or parabolic equations. Since many of researchers who are working on this domain, the main motivation of our work here is to provide an important observation of L^p-boundedness property with respect to the interpolation inequalities. In this paper, from an idea of integral approximation theory and Sobolev, Morrey embeddings, we construct a nontrivial counterexample for interpolation inequalities in the connection of results between Sobolev and Morrey spaces. Our proofs rely on the integral representation and the theory of maximal and sharp maximal functions.
