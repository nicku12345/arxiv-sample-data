Two complex matrix pairs (A,B) and (A',B') are contragrediently equivalent if there are nonsingular S and R such that (A',B')=(S^{-1}AR,R^{-1}BS). M.I. Garc\'{\i}a-Planas and V.V. Sergeichuk (1999) constructed a miniversal deformation of a canonical pair (A,B) for contragredient equivalence; that is, a simple normal form to which all matrix pairs (A + \widetilde A, B+\widetilde B) close to (A,B) can be reduced by contragredient equivalence transformations that smoothly depend on the entries of \widetilde A and  \widetilde B. Each perturbation (\widetilde A,\widetilde B) of (A,B) defines the first order induced perturbation A\widetilde{B}+\widetilde{A}B of the matrix AB, which is the first order summand in the product (A +\widetilde{A})(B+\widetilde{B}) = AB + A\widetilde{B}+\widetilde{A}B+ \widetilde A \widetilde B. We find all canonical matrix pairs (A,B), for which the first order induced perturbations A\widetilde{B}+\widetilde{A}B are nonzero for all nonzero perturbations in the normal form of Garc\'{\i}a-Planas and Sergeichuk. This problem arises in the theory of matrix differential equations \dot x=Cx, whose product of two matrices: C=AB; using the substitution x = Sy, one can reduce C by similarity transformations S^{-1}CS and (A,B) by contragredient equivalence transformations (S^{-1}AR,R^{-1}BS).
