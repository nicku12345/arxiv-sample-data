In this paper, we obtain analytical solutions of Laplace transform based some generalized class of the hyperbolic integrals in terms of hypergeometric functions {}_3F_2 (\pm1), {}_4F_3 (\pm1), {}_5F_4(\pm1), {}_6F_5(\pm1), {}_7F_6(\pm1) and {}_8F_7(\pm1) with suitable convergence conditions, by using some algebraic properties of Pochhammer symbols. In addition, reduction formulas for {}_4F_3(1), {}_7F_6(-1) and some new summation theorems (not recorded earlier in the literature of hypergeometric functions) for {}_3F_2(-1), {}_6F_5(\pm1), {}_7F_6(\pm1) and {}_8F_7(\pm1) are obtained.
