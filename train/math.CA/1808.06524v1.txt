In the present paper we solve a problem posed by Tomasz Szostok who asked about the solutions f and F to the system of inequalities  f\Big(\frac{x+y}{2}\Big)\leq \frac{F(y)-F(x)}{y-x}\leq \frac{f(x)+f(y)}{2}.    We show that f and F are the solutions to the above system of inequalities if and only if f is a continuous convex function and F is primitive function of f. This result can be interpreted as a regularity phenomenon-the solutions to the system of functional inequalities turn out to be regular without any additional assumptions.
