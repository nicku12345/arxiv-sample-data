Let \mathscr{R} be a collection of disjoint dyadic rectangles R with sides parallel to the axes, let \pi_R denote the non-smooth bilinear projection onto R \[ \pi_R (f,g)(x):=\iint \mathbf{1}_{R}(\xi,\eta) \widehat{f}(\xi) \widehat{g}(\eta) e^{2\pi i (\xi + \eta) x} d\xi d\eta \] and let r>2. We show that the bilinear Rubio de Francia operator associated to \mathscr{R} given by \[ f,g \mapsto \Big(\sum_{R\in\mathscr{R}} |\pi_{R} (f,g)|^r \Big)^{1/r} \] is L^p \times L^q \rightarrow L^s bounded whenever 1/p + 1/q = 1/s, r'<p,q<r. This extends from squares to rectangles a previous result by the same authors, and as a corollary extends in the same way a previous result from Benea and the first author for smooth projections, albeit in a reduced range.
