We present a coordinate-free version of Fefferman's solution of Whitney's extension problem in the space C^{m-1,1}(\mathbb{R}^n). While the original argument relies on an elaborate induction on collections of partial derivatives, our proof uses the language of ideals and translation-invariant subspaces in the ring of polynomials. We emphasize the role of compactness in the proof, first in the familiar sense of topological compactness, but also in the sense of finiteness theorems arising in logic and semialgebraic geometry. In a follow-up paper, we apply these ideas to study extension problems for a class of sub-Riemannian manifolds where global coordinates may be unavailable.
