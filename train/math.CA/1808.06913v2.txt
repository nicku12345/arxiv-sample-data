We show that the Hardy-Littlewood maximal operator is bounded on a reflexive variable Lebesgue space L^{p(\cdot)} over a space of homogeneous type (X,d,\mu) if and only if it is bounded on its dual space L^{p'(\cdot)}, where 1/p(x)+1/p'(x)=1 for x\in X. This result extends the corresponding result of Lars Diening from the Euclidean setting of \mathbb{R}^n to the setting of spaces of homogeneous type (X,d,\mu).
