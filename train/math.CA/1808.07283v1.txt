In the current paper, we study how the speed of convergence of a sequence of angles decreasing to zero influences the possibility of constructing a rare differentiation basis of rectangles in the plane, one side of which makes with the horizontal axis an angle belonging to the given sequence, that differentiates precisely a fixed Orlicz space.
