In this paper, we study the asymptotic behavior of solutions to a scalar fractional delay differential equations around the equilibrium points. More precise, we provide conditions on the coefficients under which a linear fractional delay equation is asymptotically stable and show that the asymptotic stability of the trivial solution is preserved under a small nonlinear Lipschitz perturbation of the fractional delay differential equation.
