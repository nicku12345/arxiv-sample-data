Working with a general class of linear Hamiltonian systems on [0, 1], we show that renormalized oscillation results can be obtained in a natural way through consideration of the Maslov index associated with appropriately chosen paths of Lagrangian subspaces of \mathbb{C}^{2n}. We verify that our applicability class includes Dirac and Sturm-Liouville systems, as well as a system arising from differential-algebraic equations for which the spectral parameter appears nonlinearly.
