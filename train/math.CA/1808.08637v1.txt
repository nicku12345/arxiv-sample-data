The purpose of this article is to construct highly localized summability kernels on the unit sphere in {\mathbb R}^d that are restrictions to the sphere of linear combinations of a small number of shifts of the fundamental solution of the Laplace equation (Newtonian kernel) with poles outside the unit ball in {\mathbb R}^d. The same problem is also solved for the subspace {\mathbb R}^{d-1} in {\mathbb R}^d.
