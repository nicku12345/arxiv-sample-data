The aim of this paper is to present an abstract and general approach to jump inequalities in harmonic analysis. Our principal conclusion is the refinement of r-variational estimates, previously known for r>2, to end-point results for the jump quasi-seminorm corresponding to r=2. This is applied to the dimension-free results recently obtained by the first two authors in collaboration with Bourgain and Wr\'obel (arXiv:1708.04639 and arXiv:1804.07679), and also to operators of Radon type treated by Jones, Seeger, and Wright.
