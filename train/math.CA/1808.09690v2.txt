Given a real function f on an interval [a,b] satisfying mild regularity conditions, we determine the number of zeros of f by evaluating a certain integral. The integrand depends on f, f' and f''. In particular, by approximating the integral with the trapezoidal rule on a fine enough grid, we can compute the number of zeros of f by evaluating finitely many values of f,f' and f''. A variant of the integral even allows to determine the number of the zeros broken down by their multiplicity.
