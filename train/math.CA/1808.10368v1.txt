We consider a class of multiparameter singular Radon integral operators on the Heisenberg group {\mathbb H}^1 where the underlying variety is the graph of a polynomial. A remarkable difference with the euclidean case, where Heisenberg convolution is replaced by euclidean convolution, is that the operators on the Heisenberg group are always L^2 bounded. This is not the case in the euclidean setting where L^2 boundedness depends on the polynomial defining the underlying surface. Here we uncover some new, interesting phenomena. For example, although the Heisenberg group operators are always L^2 bounded, the bounds are {\it not} uniform in the coefficients of polynomials with fixed degree. When we ask for which polynoimals uniform L^2 bounds hold, we arrive at the {\it same} class where uniform bounds hold in the euclidean case.
