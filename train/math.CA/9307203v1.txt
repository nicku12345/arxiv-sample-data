Using the standard square--function method (based on the Poisson semigroup), multiplier conditions of H\"ormander type are derived for Laguerre expansions in L^p--spaces with power weights in the A_p-range; this result can be interpreted as an ``upper end point'' multiplier criterion which is fairly good for p near 1 or near \infty . A weighted generalization of Kanjin's \cite{kan} transplantation theorem allows to obtain a ``lower end point'' multiplier criterion whence by interpolation nearly ``optimal'' multiplier criteria (in dependance of p, the order of the Laguerre polynomial, the weight).
