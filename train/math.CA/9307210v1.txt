It is shown how sums of squares of real valued functions can be used to give new proofs of the reality of the zeros of the Bessel functions J_\alpha (z) when \alpha \ge -1, confluent hypergeometric functions {}_0F_1(c\/; z) when c>0 or 0>c>-1, Laguerre polynomials L_n^\alpha(z) when \alpha \ge -2, and Jacobi polynomials P_n^{(\alpha,\beta)}(z) when \alpha \ge -1 and  \beta \ge -1. Besides yielding new inequalities for |F(z)|^2, where F(z) is one of these functions, the derived identities lead to inequalities for \partial |F(z)|^2/\partial y and \partial ^2 |F(z)|^2/\partial y^2, which also give new proofs of the reality of the zeros.
