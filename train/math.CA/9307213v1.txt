A number of new definite integrals involving Bessel functions are presented. These have been derived by finding new integral representations for the product of two Bessel functions of different order and argument in terms of the generalized hypergeometric function with subsequent reduction to special cases. Connection is made with Weber's second exponential integral and Laplace transforms of products of three Bessel functions.
