We present results on co-recursive associated Laguerre and Jacobi polynomials which are of interest for the solution of the Chapman-Kolmogorov equations of some birth and death processes with or without absorption. Explicit forms, generating functions, and absolutely continuous part of the spectral measures are given. We derive fourth-order differential equations satisfied by the polynomials with a special attention to some simple limiting cases.
