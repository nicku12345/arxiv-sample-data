Recurrence coefficients of semi-classical orthogonal polynomials (orthogonal polynomials related to a weight function w such that w'/w is a rational function) are shown to be solutions of non linear differential equations with respect to a well-chosen parameter, according to principles established by D. G. Chudnovsky. Examples are given. For instance, the recurrence coefficients in a_{n+1}p_{n+1}(x)=xp_n(x) -a_np_{n-1}(x) of the orthogonal polynomials related to the weight \exp(-x^4/4-tx^2) on {\blackb R\/} satisfy 4a_n^3\ddot a_n = (3a_n^4+2ta_n^2-n)(a_n^4+2ta_n^2+n), and a_n^2 satisfies a Painlev\'e {\rm P}_{\rm IV} equation.
