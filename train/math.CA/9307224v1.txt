This paper studies a suitably normalized set of generalized Hermite polynomials and sets down a relevant Mehler formula, Rodrigues formula, and generalized translation operator. Weighted generalized Hermite polynomials are the eigenfunctions of a generalized Fourier transform which satisfies an F. and M. Riesz theorem on the absolute continuity of analytic measures. The Bose-like oscillator calculus, which generalizes the calculus associated with the quantum mechanical simple harmonic oscillator, is studied in terms of these polynomials.
