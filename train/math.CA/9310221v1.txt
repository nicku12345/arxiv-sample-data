We establish an integral representations of a right inverses of the Askey-Wilson finite difference operator in an L^2 space weighted by the weight function of the continuous q-Jacobi polynomials. We characterize the eigenvalues of this integral operator and prove a q-analog of the expansion of e^{ixy} in Jacobi polynomials of argument x. We also outline a general procedure of finding integral representations for inverses of linear operators.
