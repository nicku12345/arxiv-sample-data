A \tphin contiguous relation is used to derive contiguous relations for a very-well-poised \ephis. These in turn yield solutions to the associated q-Askey-Wilson polynomial recurrence relation, expressions for the associated continued fraction, the weight function and a q-analogue of a generalized Dougall's theorem.
