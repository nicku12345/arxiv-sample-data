When G(z) is a power series in z, many authors now write `[z^n] G(z)' for the coefficient of z^n in G(z), using a notation introduced by Goulden and Jackson in [\GJ, p. 1]. More controversial, however, is the proposal of the same authors [\GJ, p. 160] to let `[z^n/n!] G(z)' denote the coefficient of z^n/n!, i.e., n! times the coefficient of z^n. An alternative generalization of [z^n] G(z), in which we define [F(z)] G(z) to be a linear function of both F and G, seems to be more useful because it facilitates algebraic manipulations. The purpose of this paper is to explore some of the properties of such a definition. The remarks are dedicated to Tony Hoare because of his lifelong interest in the improvement of notations that facilitate manipulation.
