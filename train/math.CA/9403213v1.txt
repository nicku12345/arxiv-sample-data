We investigate the asymptotic properties of orthogonal polynomials for a class of inner products including the discrete Sobolev inner products \langle h,g \rangle = \int hg\, d\mu + \sum_{j=1}^m \sum_{i=0}^{N_j} M_{j,i} h^{(i)}(c_j) g^{(i)}(c_j), where \mu is a certain type of complex measure on the real line, and c_j are complex numbers in the complement of \supp(\mu). The Sobolev orthogonal polynomials are compared with the orthogonal polynomials corresponding to the measure \mu.
