In this article we will describe the \Maple\ implementation of an algorithm presented in~\cite{Koe92}--\cite{Koeortho} which computes an {\em exact\/} formal power series (FPS) of a given function. This procedure will enable the user to reproduce most of the results of the extensive bibliography on series~\cite{Han}. We will give an overview of the algorithm and then present some parts of it in more detail.
