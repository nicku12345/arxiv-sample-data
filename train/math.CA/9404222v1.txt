In \cite{Koe92}--\cite{Koe93c} the first author published an algorithm for the conversion of analytic functions for which derivative rules are given into their representing power series \sum\limits_{k=0}^{\infty}a_{k}z^{k} at the origin and vice versa, implementations of which exist in {\sc Mathematica} \cite{Wol}, (s.\ \cite{Koe93c}), {\sc Maple} \cite{Map} (s.\ \cite{GK}) and {\sc Reduce} \cite{Red} (s.\ \cite{Neun}).   One main part of this procedure is an algorithm to derive a homogeneous linear differential equation with polynomial coefficients for the given function. We call this type of ordinary differential equations {\sl simple}.
