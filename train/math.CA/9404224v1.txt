Given a parametrised weight function \omega(x,\mu) such that the quotients of its consecutive moments are M\"obius maps, it is possible to express the underlying biorthogonal polynomials in a closed form \cite{IN2}. In the present paper we address ourselves to two related issues. Firstly, we demonstrate that, subject to additional assumptions, every such \omega obeys (in x) a linear differential equation whose solution is a generalized hypergeometric function. Secondly, using a generalization of standard divided differences, we present a new explicit representation of the underlying orthogonal polynomials.
