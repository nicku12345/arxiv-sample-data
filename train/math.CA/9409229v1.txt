A contiguous relation for complementry pairs of very well poised balanced {}_{10}\phi_9 basic hypergeometric functions is used to derive an explict expression for the associated continued fraction. This generalizes the continued fraction results associated with both Ramanujan's Entry 40 and Askey-Wilson polynomials which can be recovered as limits. Associated with our continued fraction results there are systems of biorthogonal rational functions that have yet to be derived.
