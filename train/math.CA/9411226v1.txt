Explicit solutions for the three-term recurrence satisfied by associated continuous dual q-Hahn polynomials are obtained. A minimal solution is identified and an explicit expression for the related continued fraction is derived. The absolutely continuous component of the spectral measure is obtained. Eleven limit cases are discussed in some detail. These include associated big q-Laguerre , associated Wall, associated Al-Salam-Chihara, associated Al-Salam-Carlitz I, and associated continuous q-Hermite polynomials.
