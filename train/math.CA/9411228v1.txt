We present a method derived from Laplace transform theory that enables the evaluation of fractional integrals. This method is adapted and extended in a variety of ways to demonstrate its utility in deriving alternative representations for other classes of integrals. We also use the method in conjunction with several different techniques to derive many results that have not appeared in tables of integrals.
