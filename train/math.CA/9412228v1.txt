This article describes the REDUCE package ZEILBERG implemented by Gregor St\"olting and the author.   The REDUCE package ZEILBERG is a careful implementation of the Gosper and Zeilberger algorithms for indefinite, and definite summation of hypergeometric terms, respectively. An expression a_k is called a {\sl hypergeometric term} (or {\sl closed form}), if a_{k}/a_{k-1} is a rational function with respect to k. Typical hypergeometric terms are ratios of products of powers, factorials, \Gamma function terms, binomial coefficients, and shifted factorials (Pochhammer symbols) that are integer-linear in their arguments.
