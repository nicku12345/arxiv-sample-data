Recently we found necessary and sufficient conditions for the convergence at a preassigned point of the spherical partial sums of the Fourier integral in a class of piecewise smooth functions in Euclidean space. These yield elementary examples of divergent Fourier integrals in three dimensions and higher. Meanwhile, several years ago Gottlieb and Orsag observed that in two dimensions we may expect slower convergence at certain points, specifically for Fourier-Bessel series of radial functions.   In this paper we investigate the rate of convergence of the spherical partial sums of the Fourier integral for a class of piecewise smooth functions. The basic result is an asymptotic expansion which allows us to read off the rate of convergence at a pre-assigned point.
