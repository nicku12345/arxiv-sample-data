Our main result is to give necessary and sufficient conditions, in terms of Fourier transforms, on a closed ideal I in \loneg, the space of radial integrable functions on G=SU(1,1), so that I=\loneg or I=\lonez---the ideal of \loneg functions whose integral is zero. This is then used to prove a generalization of Furstenberg's theorem which characterizes harmonic functions on the unit disk by a mean value property and a ``two circles" Morera type theorem (earlier announced by Agranovski\u{\i}).
