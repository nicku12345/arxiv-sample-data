Difference calculus compatible with polynomials (i.e., such that the divided difference operator of first order applied to any polynomial must yield a polynomial of lower degree) can only be made on special lattices well known in contemporary q-calculus. Orthogonal polynomials satisfying difference relations on such lattices are presented. In particular, lattices which are dense on intervals (|q|=1) are considered.
