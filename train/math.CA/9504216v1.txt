Sufficient ultraspherical multiplier criteria are refined in such a way that they are comparable with necessary multiplier conditions. Also new necessary conditions for Jacobi multipliers are deduced which, in particular, imply known Cohen type inequalities. Muckenhoupt's transplantation theorem is used in an essential way.
