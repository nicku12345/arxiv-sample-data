Fourier series in orthogonal polynomials with respect to a measure \nu on [-1,1] are studied when \nu is a linear combination of a generalized Jacobi weight and finitely many Dirac deltas in [-1,1]. We prove some weighted norm inequalities for the partial sum operators S_n, their maximal operator S^* and the commutator [M_b, S_n], where M_b denotes the operator of pointwise multiplication by b \in \BMO. We also prove some norm inequalities for S_n when \nu is a sum of a Laguerre weight on \R^+ and a positive mass on 0.
