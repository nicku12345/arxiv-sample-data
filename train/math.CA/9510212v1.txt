We apply a theorem of Geronimus to derive some new formulas connecting Schur functions with orthogonal polynomials on the unit circle. The applications include the description of the associated measures and a short proof of Boyd's result about Schur functions. We also give a simple proof for the above mentioned theorem of Geronimus.
