The double hypergeometric Kamp\'e de F\'eriet series F^{0:3}_{1:1}(1,1) depends upon 9 complex parameters. We present three cases with 2 relations between those 9 parameters, and show that under these circumstances F^{0:3}_{1:1}(1,1) can be written as a {}_4F_3(1) series. Some limiting cases of these transformation formulas give rise to new summation results for special F^{0:3}_{1:1}(1,1)'s. The actual transformation results arose out of the study of 9-j coefficients.
