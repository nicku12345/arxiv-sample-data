The function y=\Phi_\alpha(x), the solution of y^\alpha e^y=x for x and y large enough, has a series expansion in terms of \ln x and \ln\ln x, with coefficients given in terms of Stirling cycle numbers. It is shown that this expansion converges for x>(\alpha e)^\alpha for \alpha \ge 1. It is also shown that new expansions can be obtained for \Phi_\alpha in terms of associated Stirling numbers. The new expansions converge more rapidly and on a larger domain.
