We list the so-called Askey-scheme of hypergeometric orthogonal polynomials. In chapter 1 we give the definition, the orthogonality relation, the three term recurrence relation and generating functions of all classes of orthogonal polynomials in this scheme. In chapeter 2 we give all limit relation between different classes of orthogonal polynomials listed in the Askey-scheme.   In chapter 3 we list the q-analogues of the polynomials in the Askey-scheme. We give their definition, orthogonality relation, three term recurrence relation and generating functions. In chapter 4 we give the limit relations between those basic hypergeometric orthogonal polynomials. Finally in chapter 5 we point out how the `classical` hypergeometric orthogonal polynomials of the Askey-scheme can be obtained from their q-analogues.
