We consider the asymptotic behavior of the incomplete gamma functions gamma(-a,-z) and Gamma(-a,-z) as a goes to infinity. Uniform expansions are needed to describe the transition area z~a in which case error functions are used as main approximants. We use integral representations of the incomplete gamma functions and derive a uniform equation by applying techniques used for the existing uniform expansions for gamma(a,z) and Gamma(a,z). The result is compared with Olver's uniform expansion for the generalized exponential integral. A numerical verification of the expansion is given in a final section.
