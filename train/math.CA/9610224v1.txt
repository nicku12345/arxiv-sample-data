Connections between Hankel transforms of different order for L^p-functions are examined. Well known are the results of Guy [Guy] and Schindler [Sch]. Further relations result from projection formulae for Bessel functions of different order. Consequences for Hankel multipliers are exhibited and implications for radial Fourier multipliers on Euclidean spaces of different dimensions indicated.
