For the Bessel function \begin{equation} \label{bessel} J_{\nu}(z) = \sum\limits_{k=0}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^k \left( \frac{z}{2} \right)^{\nu+2k}}{k! \Gamma(\nu+1+k)} \end{equation} there exist several q-analogues. The oldest q-analogues of the Bessel function were introduced by F. H. Jackson at the beginning of this century, see M. E. H. Ismail \cite{Is1} for the appropriate references. Another q-analogue of the Bessel function has been introduced by W. Hahn in a special case and by H. Exton in full generality, see R. F. Swarttouw \cite{Sw1} for a historic overview.   Here we concentrate on properties of the Hahn-Exton q-Bessel function and in particular on its zeros and the associated q-Lommel polynomials.
