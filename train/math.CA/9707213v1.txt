In a recent paper Ismail, Masson, and Suslov have established a continuous orthogonality relation and some other properties of a _2\varphi_1-Bessel function on a q-quadratic grid. Dick Askey suggested that the ``Bessel-type orthogonality'' at the _2\varphi_1-level has really a general character and can be extended up to the _8\varphi_7-level. Very-well-poised _8\varphi_7-functions are known as a nonterminating version of the classical Askey--Wilson polynomials. Askey's congecture has been proved by the author. In the present paper we discuss in details some properties of the orthogonal _8\varphi_7-functions. Another type of the orthogonality relation for a very-well-poised _8\varphi_7-function was recently found by Askey, Rahman, and Suslov.
