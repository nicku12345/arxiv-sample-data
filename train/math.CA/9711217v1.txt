Due to Girard's (sometimes called Waring's) formula the sum of the r-th power of the zeros of every one variable polynomial of degree N, P_{N}(x), can be given explicitly in terms of the coefficients of the monic {\tilde P}_{N}(x) polynomial. This formula is closely related to a known \par \noindent N-1 variable generalization of Chebyshev's polynomials of the first kind, T_{r}^{(N-1)}. The generating function of these power sums (or moments) is known to involve the logarithmic derivative of the considered polynomial. This entails a simple formula for the Stieltjes transform of the distribution of zeros. Perron-Stieltjes inversion can be used to find this distribution, {\it e.g.} for N\to \infty.\par Classical orthogonal polynomials are taken as examples. The results for ordinary Chebyshev T_{N}(x) and U_{N}(x) polynomials are presented in detail. This will correct a statement about power sums of zeros of Chebyshev's T-polynomials found in the literature. For the various cases (Jacobi, Laguerre, Hermite) these moment generating functions provide solutions to certain Riccati equations.
