The paper is devoted to study the H-function defined by the Mellin-Barnes integral   H^{m,n}_{\thinspace p,q}(z)={\frac1{2\pi i}}\int_{\Lss} \HHs^{m,n}_{\thinspace p,q}(s)z^{-s}ds,   where the function \HH^{m,n}_{\thinspace p,q}(s) is a certain ratio of products of Gamma functions with the argument s and the contour \LL is specially chosen. The conditions for the existence of H^{m,n}_{\thinspace p,q}(z) are discussed and explicit power and power-logarithmic series expansions of H^{m,n}_{p,q}(z) near zero and infinity are given. The obtained results define more precisely the known results.
