Integral transforms   (\mbox{\boldmathH}f)(x)=\int^\infty_0H^{m,n}_{\thinspace p,q} \left[xt\left|\begin{array}{c}(a_i,\alpha_i)_{1,p}\\[1mm](b_j,\beta_j)_{1,q} \end{array}\right.\right]f(t)dt   involving Fox's H-functions as kernels are studied in the spaces \Ls_{\nu,r} of functions f such that   \int^\infty_0|t^\nu f(t)|^r\frac{dt}t<\infty\quad(1\ \eqls\ r<\infty, \ \nu\in\Rs).   Mapping properties such as the boundedness, the representation and the range of the transforms \boldmathH are given.
