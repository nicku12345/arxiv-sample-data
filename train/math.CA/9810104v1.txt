Final representation of all those measures \mu for which algebraic polynomials are dense in L_p(R, d\mu) is found. The weighted analogue of the Weierstrass polynomial approximation theorem and a new version of the M. Krein's theorem about partial fraction decomposition of reciprocal of an entire function are established.
