The purpose of this paper is to prove the L^p boundedness of singular Radon transforms and their maximal analogues. These operators differ from the traditional singular integrals and maximal functions in that their definition at any point x in R^n involves integration over a k-dimensional submanifold of R^n, depending on x, with k < n. The role of the underlying geometric data which determines the submanifolds and how they depend on x, makes the analysis of these operators quite different from their standard analogues. In fact, much of our work is involved in the examination of the resulting geometric situation, and the elucidation of an attached notion of curvature (a kind of ``finite-type'' condition) which is crucial for our analysis.
