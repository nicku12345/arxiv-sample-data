Let T be an oscillatory integral operator on L^2(R) with a smooth real phase function S(x,y). We prove that, in all cases but the one described below, after localization to a small neighborhood of the origin the norm of T decays like N^{-d/2} as the frequency N->infty, where d is the Newton decay rate introduced by Phong and Stein, which is determined by the Newton diagram of S(x,y). For real analytic phase functions this result was proved by Phong and Stein. For smooth phase functions the best known results so far contained a loss of epsilon in the exponent (implicit in the work of Seeger).   The exceptional case mentioned above happens when the Taylor series of the mixed partial derivative S''(x,y) factorizes in R[[x,y]] as U(x,y)(y-f(x))^k, where U(x,y) is a unit, k\ge 2, and f(x) is a series in R[[x]] of the form Cx+(higher order), C\ne 0. In this case we prove an estimate with a loss of of a power of log N.
