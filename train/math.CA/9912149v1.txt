Consider a collection \lambda_1<...<\lambda_N of distinct positive integers and the quantities  M_1 = M_1(\lambda_1,...,\lambda_N) =   \max_{0\le x \le 2\pi} |\sum_{j=1}^N \sin{\lambda_j x}|  and  M_2 = M_2(\lambda_1,...,\lambda_N) = - \min_{0\le x \le 2\pi}   \sum_{j=1} \cos{\lambda_j x}.  Prompted by a discussion with G. Benke we prove that collections of frequencies \lambda_j which have M_1 = o(N) or M_2 = o(N) are unstable, in the sense that one can perturb the \lambda_j by one each and get M_1 \ge c N and M_2 \ge c N.
