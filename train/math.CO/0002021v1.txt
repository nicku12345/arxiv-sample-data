The automorphisms of a graph act naturally on its set of labeled imbeddings to produce its unlabeled imbeddings. The imbedding sum of a graph is a polynomial that contains useful information about a graph's labeled and unlabeled imbeddings. In particular, the polynomial enumerates the number of different ways the unlabeled imbeddings can be vertex colored and enumerates the labeled and unlabeled imbeddings by their symmetries.
