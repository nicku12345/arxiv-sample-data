We give a combinatorial formula for the Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials P_{x,w} in the symmetric group when w is a 321-hexagon-avoiding permutation. Our formula, which depends on a combinatorial framework developed by Deodhar, can be expressed in terms of a simple statistic on all subexpressions of any fixed reduced expression for w. We also show that w being 321-hexagon-avoiding is equivalent to several other conditions, such as the Bott-Samelson resolution of the Schubert variety X_w being small. We conclude with a simple method for completely determining the singular locus of X_w when w is 321-hexagon-avoiding.
