In this paper we find closed form for the generating function of powers of any non-degenerate second-order recurrence sequence, completing a study begun by Carlitz and Riordan in 1962. Moreover, we generalize a theorem of Horadam on partial sums involving such sequences. Also, we find closed forms for weighted (by binomial coefficients) partial sums of powers of any non-degenerate second-order recurrence sequences. As corollaries we give some known and seemingly unknown identities and derive some very interesting congruence relations involving Fibonacci and Lucas sequences.
