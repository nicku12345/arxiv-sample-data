We study the nonlinearity and the weight of the rotation-symmetric (RotS) functions defined by Pieprzyk and Qu. We give exact results for the nonlinearity and weight of 2-degree RotS functions with the help of the semi-bent functions and we give the generating function for the weight of the 3-degree RotS function. Based on the numerical examples and our observations we state a conjecture on the nonlinearity and weight of the 3-degree RotS functions.
