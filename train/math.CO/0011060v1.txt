In this paper we extend the theory of oriented matroids to Lagrangian orthogonal matroids and their representations, and give a completely natural transformation from a representation of a classical oriented matroid to a representation of the same oriented matroid considered as a Lagrangian orthogonal matroid. Classical concepts of orientation and this extension may both be thought of as stratifications of thin Schubert cells into unions of connected components.
