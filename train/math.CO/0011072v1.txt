Let E_n^r=\{[\tau]_a=(\tau_1^{(a_1)},...,\tau_n^{(a_n)})| \tau\in S_n,\ 1\leq a_i\leq r\} be the set of all signed permutations on the symbols 1,2,...,n with signs 1,2,...,r. We prove, for every 2-letter signed pattern [\tau]_a, that the number of [\tau]_a-avoiding signed permutations in E_n^r is given by the formula \sum\limits_{j=0}^n j!(r-1)^j{n\choose j}^2. Also we prove that there are only one Wilf class for r=1, four Wilf classes for r=2, and six Wilf classes for r\geq 3.
