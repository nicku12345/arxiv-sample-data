We compute the weighted enumeration of plane partitions contained in a given box with complementation symmetry where adding one half of an orbit of cubes and removing the other half of the orbit changes the weight by -1 as proposed by Kuperberg. We use nonintersecting lattice path families to accomplish this for transpose-complementary, cyclically symmetric transpose-complementary and totally symmetric self-complementary plane partitions. For symmetric transpose-complementary and self-complementary plane partitions we get partial results. We also describe Kuperberg's proof for the case of cyclically symmetric self-complementary plane partitions.
