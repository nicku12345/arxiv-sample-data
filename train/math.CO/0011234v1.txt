We investigate properties of the set of discrete Morse functions on a simplicial complex as defined by Forman. It is not difficult to see that the pairings of discrete Morse functions of a finite simplicial complex again form a simplicial complex, the discrete Morse complex. It turns out that several known results from combinatorial topology and enumerative combinatorics, which previously seemed to be unrelated, can be re-interpreted in the setting of these discrete Morse complexes.
