We answer a question posed in [Elkies 1996] (math.CO/9905198) by constructing a class of pawn endgames on m-by-n boards that show the Nimbers *k for large k. We do this by modifying and generalizing T.R. Dawson's ``pawns game'' [Berlekamp et al. 1982] (Winning Ways I). Our construction works for m>8 and n sufficiently large; on the basis of computational evidence we conjecture, but cannot yet prove, that the construction yields *k for all integers k.
