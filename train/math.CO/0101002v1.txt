Kasteleyn counted the number of domino tilings of a rectangle by considering a mutation of the adjacency matrix: a Kasteleyn matrix K. In this paper we present a generalization of Kasteleyn matrices and a combinatorial interpretation for the coefficients of the characteristic polynomial of KK^\ast (which we call the singular polynomial), where K is a generalized Kasteleyn matrix for a planar bipartite graph. We also present a q-version of these ideas and a few results concerning tilings of special regions such as rectangles.
