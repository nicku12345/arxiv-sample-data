We state, discuss, provide evidence for, and prove in special cases the conjecture that the probability that a random tiling by rhombi of a hexagon with side lengths 2n+a,2n+b,2n+c,2n+a,2n+b,2n+c contains the (horizontal) rhombus with coordinates (2n+x,2n+y) is equal to {1/3} + g_{a,b,c,x,y}(n) {\binom {2n}{n}}^3 / \binom {6n}{3n}, where g_{a,b,c,x,y}(n) is a rational function in n. Several specific instances of this "1/3-phenomenon" are made explicit.
