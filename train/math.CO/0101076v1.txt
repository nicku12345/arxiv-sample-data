Bisztriczky defines a multiplex as a generalization of a simplex, and an ordinary polytope as a generalization of a cyclic polytope. This paper presents results concerning the combinatorics of multiplexes and ordinary polytopes. The flag vector of the multiplex is computed, and shown to equal the flag vector of a many-folded pyramid over a polygon. Multiplexes, but not other ordinary polytopes, are shown to be elementary. It is shown that all complete subgraphs of the graph of a multiplex determine faces of the multiplex. The toric h-vectors of the ordinary 5-dimensional polytopes are given. Graphs of ordinary polytopes are studied. Their chromatic numbers and diameters are computed, and they are shown to be Hamiltonian.
