This paper is devoted to the presentation of a combinatorial approach for analyzing the performance of an important modulation protocol used in mobile telecommunications. We show in particular that a fundamental formula, in this context, is in fact highly connected with a slight modification of a very classical algorithm of Knuth that realizes a bijection between pairs of Young tableaux of conjugated shapes and \{0,1\}-matrices. These new considerations allowed us to obtain the very first results with respect to important specializations (for practical applications) of the performance analysis formula that we studied.
