Let \{b_{k}(n)\}_{n=0}^{\infty} be the Bell numbers of order k. It is proved that the sequence \{b_{k}(n)/n!\}_{n=0}^{\infty} is log-concave and the sequence \{b_{k}(n)\}_{n=0}^{\infty} is log-convex, or equivalently, the following inequalities hold for all n\geq 0, 1\leq {b_{k}(n+2) b_{k}(n) \over b_{k}(n+1)^{2}} \leq {n+2 \over n+1}. Let \{\a(n)\}_{n=0}^{\infty} be a sequence of positive numbers with \a(0)=1. We show that if \{\a(n)\}_{n=0}^{\infty} is log-convex, then \a (n) \a (m) \leq \a(n+m), \quad \forall n, m\geq 0. On the other hand, if \{\a(n)/n!\}_{n=0}^{\infty} is log-concave, then \a (n+m) \leq {n+m \choose n} \a (n) \a (m), \quad \forall n, m\geq 0. In particular, we have the following inequalities for the Bell numbers b_{k}(n) b_{k}(m) \leq b_{k}(n+m) \leq {n+m \choose n} b_{k}(n) b_{k}(m), \quad \forall n, m\geq 0. Then we apply these results to white noise distribution theory.
