This article is devoted to the study of several algebras which are related to symmetric functions, and which admit linear bases labelled by various combinatorial objects: permutations (free quasi-symmetric functions), standard Young tableaux (free symmetric functions) and packed integer matrices (matrix quasi-symmetric functions). Free quasi-symmetric functions provide a kind of noncommutative Frobenius characteristic for a certain category of modules over the 0-Hecke algebras. New examples of indecomposable H_n(0)-modules are discussed, and the homological properties of H_n(0) are computed for small n. Finally, the algebra of matrix quasi-symmetric functions is interpreted as a convolution algebra.
