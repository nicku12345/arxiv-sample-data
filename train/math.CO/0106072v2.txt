Let V^{\otimes n} be the n-fold tensor product of a vector space V. Following I. Schur we consider the action of the symmetric group S_n on V^{\otimes n} by permuting coordinates. In the `super' (\Bbb Z_2 graded) case V=V_0\oplus V_1, a \pm sign is added [BR]. These actions give rise to the corresponding Schur algebras S(S_n,V). Here S(S_n,V) is compared with S(A_n,V), the Schur algebra corresponding to the alternating subgroup A_n\subset S_n . While in the `classical' (signless) case these two Schur algebras are the same for n large enough, it is proved that in the `super' case where \dim V_0=\dim V_1,  S(A_n,V) is isomorphic to the crossed-product algebra S(A_n,V)\cong S(S_n,V)\times\Bbb Z_2 .
