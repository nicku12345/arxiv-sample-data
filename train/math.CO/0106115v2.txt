We extend work of McKay, Morse, and Wilf by giving exact formulas and asymptotic formulas for the number of skew Young tableaux T in two situations: (1) the "inside shape" and total number of cells of T are fixed, and (2) the inside shape of T is fixed. The proofs use the theory of symmetric functions and estimates for irreducible characters of the symmetric group due to Thoma, Vershik, Kerov, and Biane.
