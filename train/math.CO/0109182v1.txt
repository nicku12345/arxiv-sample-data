The distribution of a given sequence in the set of all sequences with n ones and m = M - n zeros are found by relating the problem to the partitions of a natural number in m natural summands, taking into account the order. The formulas obtained have many applications both in Physics and Mathematics. Examples discussed in the present paper are: non Markovian chains, partition functions of binary alloys and Ising magnets, generalized Kaplansky lemma, generalized Fibonacci numbers and a general expansion of \sum_{h=0}^{m} h^{r} {\binom{m}{h}}^{2} in terms of the Stirling numbers of second kind.
