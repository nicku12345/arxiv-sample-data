In [BS] Babson and Steingrimsson introduced generalized permutation patterns that allow the requirement that two adjacent letters in a pattern must be adjacent in the permutation.   Let f_{\tau;r}(n) be the number of 1\mn3\mn2-avoiding permutations on n letters that contain exactly r occurrences of \tau, where \tau a generalized pattern on k letters. Let F_{\tau;r}(x) and F_\tau(x,y) be the generating functions defined by F_{\tau;r}(x)=\sum_{n\geq0} f_{\tau;r}(n)x^n and F_\tau(x,y)=\sum_{r\geq0}F_{\tau;r}(x)y^r. We find an explicit expression for F_\tau(x,y) in the form of a continued fraction for where \tau given as a generalized pattern; \tau=12\mn3\mn...\mn k, \tau=21\mn3\mn...\mn k, \tau=123... k, or \tau=k... 321. In particularly, we find F_\tau(x,y) for any \tau generalized pattern of length 3. This allows us to express F_{\tau;r}(x) via Chebyshev polynomials of the second kind, and continued fractions.
