Recently, Babson and Steingrimsson (see [BS]) introduced generalized permutations patterns that allow the requirement that two adjacent letters in a pattern must be adjacent in the permutation.   We study generating functions for the number of permutations on n letters avoiding 1-3-2 (or containing 1-3-2 exactly once) and an arbitrary generalized pattern \tau on k letters, or containing \tau exactly once. In several cases the generating function depends only on k and is expressed via Chebyshev polynomials of the second kind, and generating function of Motzkin numbers.
