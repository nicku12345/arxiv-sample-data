Recently, Babson and Steingrimsson (see \cite{BS}) introduced generalized permutations patterns that allow the requirement that two adjacent letters in a pattern must be adjacent in the permutation.   Following \cite{BCS}, let e_k\pi (respectively; f_k\pi) be the number of the occurrences of the generalized pattern 12\mn3\mn...\mn k (respectively; 21\mn3\mn...\mn k) in \pi. In the present note, we study the distribution of the statistics e_k\pi and f_k\pi in a permutation avoiding the classical pattern 1\mn3\mn2.   Also we present an applications, which relates the Narayana numbers, Catalan numbers, and increasing subsequences, to permutations avoiding the classical pattern 1\mn3\mn2 according to a given statistics on e_k\pi, or on f_k\pi.
