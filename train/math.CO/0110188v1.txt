Let P_r(n) be the set of partitions of n with non negative rth differences. Let \lambda be a partition chosen uniformly at random among the set P_r(n). Let d(\lambda) be a positive rth difference chosen uniformly at random in \lambda. The aim of this work is to show that for every m\ge 1, the probability that d(\lambda)\ge m approaches m^{-1/r} as n\to\infty. To prove this result we use bijective, asymptotic/analytic, and probabilistic combinatorics.
