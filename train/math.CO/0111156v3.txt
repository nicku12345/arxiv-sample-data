We show that a finite graded lattice of rank n is supersolvable if and only if it has an EL-labeling where the labels along any maximal chain form a permutation. We call such a labeling an S_n EL-labeling and we consider finite graded posets of rank n with unique top and bottom elements that have an S_n EL-labeling. We describe a type A 0-Hecke algebra action on the maximal chains of such posets. This action is local and gives a representation of these Hecke algebras whose character has characteristic that is closely related to Ehrenborg's flag quasi-symmetric function. We ask what other classes of posets have such an action and in particular we show that finite graded lattices of rank n have such an action if and only if they have an S_n EL-labeling.
