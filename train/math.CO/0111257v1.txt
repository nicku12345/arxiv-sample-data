The domatic number of a graph G, denoted dom(G), is the maximum possible cardinality of a family of disjoint sets of vertices of G, each set being a dominating set of G. It is well known that every graph without isolated vertices has dom(G) \geq 2. For every k, it is known that there are graphs with minimum degree at least k and with dom(G)=2. In this paper we prove that this is not the case if G is k-regular or {\em almost} k-regular (by ``almost'' we mean that the minimum degree is k and the maximum degree is at most Ck for some fixed real number C \geq 1). In this case we prove that dom(G) \geq (1+o_k(1))k/(2\ln k). We also prove that the order of magnitude k/\ln k cannot be improved. One cannot replace the constant 2 with a constant smaller than 1. The proof uses the so called {\em semi-random method} which means that combinatorial objects are generated via repeated applications of the probabilistic method; in our case iterative applications of the Lov\'asz Local Lemma.
