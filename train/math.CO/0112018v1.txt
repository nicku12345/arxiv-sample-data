Following Mansour, let S_n^{(r)} be the set of all coloured permutations on the symbols 1,2,...,n with colours 1,2,...,r, which is the analogous of the symmetric group when r=1, and the hyperoctahedral group when r=2. Let I\subseteq\{1,2,...,r\} be subset of d colours; we define T_{k,r}^m(I) be the set of all coloured permutations \phi\in S_k^{(r)} such that \phi_1=m^{(c)} where c\in I. We prove that, the number T_{k,r}^m(I)-avoiding coloured permutations in S_n^{(r)} equals (k-1)!r^{k-1}\prod_{j=k}^n h_j for n\geq k where h_j=(r-d)j+(k-1)d. We then prove that for any \phi\in T_{k,r}^1(I) (or any \phi\in T_{k,r}^k(I)), the number of coloured permutations in S_n^{(r)} which avoid all patterns in T_{k,r}^1(I) (or in T_{k,r}^k(I)) except for \phi and contain \phi exactly once equals \prod_{j=k}^n h_j\cdot \sum_{j=k}^n \frac{1}{h_j} for n\geq k. Finally, for any \phi\in T_{k,r}^m(I), 2\leq m\leq k-1, this number equals \prod_{j=k+1}^n h_j for n\geq k+1. These results generalize recent results due to Mansour, and due to Simion.
