We present a bijective proof of the hook-length formula for shifted standard tableaux of a fixed shape based on a modified jeu de taquin and the ideas of the bijective proof of the hook-length formula for ordinary standard tableaux by Novelli, Pak and Stoyanovskii. In their proof Novelli, Pak and Stoyanovskii define a bijection between arbitrary fillings of the Ferrers diagram with the integers 1,2,...,n and pairs of standard tableaux and hook tabloids. In our shifted version of their algorithm the map from the set of arbitrary fillings of the shifted Ferrers diagram onto the set of shifted standard tableaux is analog to the construction of Novelli, Pak and Stoyanovskii, however, unlike to their algorithm, we are forced to use the 'rowwise' total order of the cells in the shifted Ferrers diagram rather than the 'columnwise' total order as the underlying order in the algorithm. Unfortunately the construction of the shifted hook tabloid is more complicated in the shifted case. As a side-result we obtain a simple random algorithm for generating shifted standard tableaux of a given shape, which produces every such tableau equally likely.
