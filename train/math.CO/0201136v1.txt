We study generating functions for the number of involutions in S_n avoiding (or containing once) 132, and avoiding (or containing once) an arbitrary permutation \tau on k letters. In several interesting cases the generating function depends only on k and is expressed via Chebyshev polynomials of the second kind. In particular, we establish that involutions avoiding both 132 and 12... k have the same enumerative formula according to the length than involutions avoiding both 132 and any {\em double-wedge pattern} possibly followed by fixed points of total length k. Many results are also shown with a combinatorial point of view.
