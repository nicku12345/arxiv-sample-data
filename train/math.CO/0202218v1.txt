A natural generalization of single pattern avoidance is subset avoidance. A complete study of subset avoidance for the case k=3 is carried out in [SS]. For k>3 situation becomes more complicated, as the number of possible cases grows rapidly. Recently, several authors have considered the case of general k when T has some nice algebraic properties. Barcucci, Del Lungo, Pergola, and Pinzani in [BDPP) treated the case when T=T_1 is the centralizer of k-1 and k under the natural action of S_k on [k]. Mansour and Vainshtein in [MVp] treated the case when T=T_2 is maximal parabolic group of S_k.   Recently, Babson and Steingrimsson (see [BS]) introduced generalized permutations patterns that allow the requirement that two adjacent letters in a pattern must be adjacent in the permutation.   In this paper we present an analogue with generalization for the case T_1 and for the case T_2 by using generalized patterns instead of classical patterns.
