Recently, Babson and Steingrimsson (see \cite{BS}) introduced generalized permutations patterns that allow the requirement that two adjacent letters in a pattern must be adjacent in the permutation.   In this paper we study the generating functions for the number of permutations on n letters avoiding a generalized pattern ab\mn c where (a,b,c)\in S_3, and containing a prescribed number of occurrences of generalized pattern cd\mn e where (c,d,e)\in S_3. As a consequence, we derive all the previously known results for this kind of problems, as well as many new results.
