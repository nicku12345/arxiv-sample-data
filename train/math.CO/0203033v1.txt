Define S_n^k(\alpha) to be the set of permutations of \{1,2,...,n\} with exactly k fixed points which avoid the pattern \alpha \in S_m. Let s_n^k(\alpha) be the size of S_n^k(\alpha). We investigate S_n^0(\alpha) for all \alpha \in S_3 as well as show that s_n^k(132)=s_n^k(213)=s_n^k(321) and s_n^k(231)=s_n^k(312) for all 0 \leq k \leq n.
