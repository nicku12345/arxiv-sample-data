In this paper we present a novel project-and-lift approach to compute the set of minimal generators of the semigroup (\Lambda\cap\R^n_+,+) for lattices \Lambda\subseteq\Z^n. This problem class includes the computation of Hilbert bases of cones \{z:Az=0,z\in\R^n_+\} for integer matrices A. A similar approach can be used to compute only the extreme rays of such cones. Finally, some combinatorial applications and computational experience are presented.
