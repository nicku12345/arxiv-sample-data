A Dyck path is a lattice path in the plane integer lattice \mathbb{Z}\times\mathbb{Z} consisting of steps (1,1) and (1,-1), which never passes below the x-axis. A peak at height k on a Dyck path is a point on the path with coordinate y=k that is immediately preceded by a (1,1) step and immediately followed by a (1,-1) step. In this paper we find an explicit expression to the generating function for the number of Dyck paths starting at (0,0) and ending at (2n,0) with exactly r peaks at height k. This allows us to express this function via Chebyshev polynomials of the second kind and generating function for the Catalan numbers.
