A permutation \pi \in S_n is said to {\it avoid} a permutation \sigma \in S_k whenever \pi contains no subsequence with all of the same pairwise comparisons as \sigma. For any set R of permutations, we write S_n(R) to denote the set of permutations in S_n which avoid every permutation in R. In 1985 Simion and Schmidt showed that |S_n(132, 213, 123)| is equal to the Fibonacci number F_{n+1}. In this paper we generalize this result in several ways. We first use a result of Mansour to show that for any permutation \tau in a certain infinite family of permutations, |S_n(132, 213, \tau)| is given in terms of Fibonacci numbers or k-generalized Fibonacci numbers. In many cases we give explicit enumerations, which we prove bijectively. We then use generating function techniques to show that for any permutation \gamma in a second infinite family of permutations, |S_n(123, 132, \gamma)| is also given in terms of Fibonacci numbers or k-generalized Fibonacci numbers. In many cases we give explicit enumerations, some of which we prove bijectively. We go on to use generating function techniques to show that for any permutation \omega in a third infinite family of permutations, |S_n(132, 2341, \omega)| is given in terms of Fibonacci numbers, and for any permutation \mu in a fourth infinite family of permutations, |S_n(132, 3241, \mu)| is given in terms of Fibonacci numbers and k-generalized Fibonacci numbers. In several cases we give explicit enumerations. We conclude by giving an infinite class of examples of a set R of permutations for which |S_n(R)| satisfies a linear homogeneous recurrence relation with constant coefficients.
