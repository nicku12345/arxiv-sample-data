Let P and Q be polytopes, the first of "low" dimension and the second of "high" dimension. We show how to triangulate the product P \times Q efficiently (i.e., with few simplices) starting with a given triangulation of Q. Our method has a computational part, where we need to compute an efficient triangulation of P \times \Delta^m, for a (small) natural number m of our choice. \Delta^m denotes the m-simplex.   Our procedure can be applied to obtain (asymptotically) efficient triangulations of the cube I^n: We decompose I^n = I^k \times I^{n-k}, for a small k. Then we recursively assume we have obtained an efficient triangulation of the second factor and use our method to triangulate the product. The outcome is that using k=3 and m=2, we can triangulate I^n with O(0.816^{n} n!) simplices, instead of the O(0.840^{n} n!) achievable before.
