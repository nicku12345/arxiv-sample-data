Berstel proved that the Arshon sequence cannot be obtained by iteration of a morphism. An alternative proof of this fact is given here. The \sigma-sequence was constructed by Evdokimov in order to construct chains of maximal length in the n-dimensional unit cube. It turns out that the \sigma-sequence has a close connection to the Dragon curve. We prove that the \sigma-sequence can not be defined by iteration of a morphism.
