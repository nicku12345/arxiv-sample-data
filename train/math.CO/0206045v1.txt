Given an rc-graph R of permutation w and an rc-graph Y of permutation v, we provide an insertion algorithm, which defines an rc-graph R\leftarrow Y in the case when v is a shuffle with the descent at r and w has no descents greater than r or in the case when v is a shuffle, whose shape is a hook. This algorithm gives a combinatorial rule for computing the generalized Littlewood-Richardson coefficients c^{u}_{wv} in the two cases mentioned above.
