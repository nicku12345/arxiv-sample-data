In this paper we consider a variation of the classical Tur\'{a}n-type extremal problems. Let S be an n-term graphical sequence, and \sigma(S) be the sum of the terms in S. Let H be a graph. The problem is to determine the smallest even l such that any n-term graphical sequence S having \sigma(S)\ge l has a realization containing H as a subgraph. Denote this value l by \sigma(H, n). We show \sigma(C_{2m+1}, n)=m(2n-m-1)+2, for m\ge 3, n\ge 3m; \sigma(C_{2m+2}, n)=m(2n-m-1)+4, for m\ge 3, n\ge 5m-2.
