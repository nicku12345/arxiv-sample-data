We consider the design of asymmetric multiple description lattice quantizers that cover the entire spectrum of the distortion profile, ranging from symmetric or balanced to successively refinable. We present a solution to a labeling problem, which is an important part of the construction, along with a general design procedure. This procedure is illustrated using the Z^2 lattice. The asymptotic performance of the quantizer is analyzed in the high-rate case. We also evaluate its rate-distortion performance and compare it to known information theoretic bounds.
