We study a) the limit of the ratio of two consecutive terms in such a sequence and b) the limit of the ratio of two terms in which one has a lag equal to 2. In the general case limit a) does not exist but we have two limiting values depending on the parity of the index. And these limits depend on the initial conditions. Limit b) exists and does not depend on the the initial conditions. Finally we seek the set of initial conditions for which this limit exists (that is, the two limiting values coincide) and obtain this limit.
