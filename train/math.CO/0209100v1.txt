Represented Coxeter matroids of types C_n and D_n, that is, symplectic and orthogonal matroids arising from totally isotropic subspaces of symplectic or (even-dimensional) orthogonal spaces, may also be represented in buildings of type C_n and D_n, respectively. Indeed, the particular buildings involved are those arising from the flags or oriflammes, respectively, of totally isotropic subspaces. There are also buildings of type B_n arising from flags of totally isotropic subspaces in odd-dimensional orthogonal space. Coxeter matroids of type B_n are the same as those of type C_n (since they depend only upon the reflection group, not the root system). However, buildings of type B_n are distinct from those of the other types. The matroids representable in odd dimensional orthogonal space (and therefore in the building of type B_n) turn out to be a special case of symplectic (flag) matroids, those whose top component, or Lagrangian matroid, is a union of two Lagrangian orthogonal matroids. These two matroids are called a Lagrangian pair, and they are the combinatorial manifestation of the ``fork'' at the top of an oriflamme (or of the fork at the end of the Coxeter diagram of D_n).   Here we give a number of equivalent characterizations of Lagrangian pairs, and prove some rather strong properties of them.
