We establish some identities relating two sequences that are, as explained, related to the Tribonacci sequence. One of these sequences bears the same resemblance to the Tribonacci sequence as the Lucas sequence does to the Fibonacci sequence. Defining a matrix that we call Tribomatrix, which extends the Fibonacci matrix, we see that the other sequence is related to the sum of the determinants of the 2nd order principal minors of this matrix.
