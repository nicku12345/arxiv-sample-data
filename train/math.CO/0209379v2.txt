A permutation \pi is said to be {\em Dumont permutations of the first kind} if each even integer in \pi must be followed by a smaller integer, and each odd integer is either followed by a larger integer or is the last element of \pi (see, for example, \cite{Z}). In \cite{D} Dumont showed that certain classes of permutations on n letters are counted by the Genocchi numbers. In particular, Dumont showed that the (n+1)st Genocchi number is the number of Dummont permutations of the first kind on 2n letters.   In this paper we study the number of Dumont permutations of the first kind on n letters avoiding the pattern 132 and avoiding (or containing exactly once) an arbitrary pattern on k letters. In several interesting cases the generating function depends only on k.
