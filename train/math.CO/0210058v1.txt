A permutation is said to be \emph{alternating} if it starts with rise and then descents and rises come in turn. In this paper we study the generating function for the number of alternating permutations on n letters that avoid or contain exactly once 132 and also avoid or contain exactly once an arbitrary pattern on k letters. In several interesting cases the generating function depends only on k and is expressed via Chebyshev polynomials of the second kind.
