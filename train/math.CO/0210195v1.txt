A class of associative (super) algebras is presented, which naturally generalize both the symmetric algebra Sym(V) and the wedge algebra \wedge (V), where V is a vector-space. These algebras are in a bijection with those subsets of the set of the partitions which are closed under inclusions of partitions. We study the rate of growth of these algebras, then characterize the case where these algebras satisfy polynomial identities.
