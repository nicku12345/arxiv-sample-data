A survey of three recent developments in algebraic combinatorics: (1) the Laurent phenomenon, (2) Gromov-Witten invariants and toric Schur functions, and (3) toric h-vectors and intersection cohomology. This paper is a continuation of "Recent progress in algebraic combinatorics" (math.CO/0010218), which dealt with three other topics.
