Bivariate generating functions for various subsets of the class of permutations containing no descending sequence of length three or more are determined. The notion of absolute indecomposability of a permutation is introduced, and used in enumerating permutations which have a block structure avoiding 321 and whose blocks also have such structure (recursively). Generalizations of these results are discussed.
