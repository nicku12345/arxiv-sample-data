Let \bar{P} be a sequence of length 2n in which each element of \{1,2,...,n\} occurs twice. Let P' be a closed curve in a closed surface S having n points of simple auto-intersections, inducing a 4-regular graph embedded in S which is 2-face colorable. If the sequence of auto-intersections along P' is given by \bar{P}, we say that is a {\em P' 2-face colorable solution for the Gauss Code \bar{P} on surface S} or a {\em lacet for \bar{P} on S}. In this paper we present a necessary and sufficient condition yielding these solutions when S is Klein bottle. The condition take the form of a system of m linear equations in 2n variables over \Z_2, where m \le n(n-1)/2. Our solution generalize solutions for the projective plane and on the sphere. In a strong way, the Klein bottle is an extremal case admitting an affine linear solution: we show that the similar problem on the torus and on surfaces of higher connectivity are modelled by a quadratic system of equations.
