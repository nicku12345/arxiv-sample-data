If a graph G_M is embedded into a closed surface S such that S \backslash G_M is a collection of disjoint open discs, then M=(G_M,S) is called a {\em map}. A {\em zigzag} in a map M is a closed path which alternates choosing, at each star of a vertex, the leftmost and the rightmost possibilities for its next edge. If a map has a single zigzag we show that the cyclic ordering of the edges along it induces linear transformations, c_P and c_{P^\sim} whose images and kernels are respectively the cycle and bond spaces (over GF(2)) of G_M and G_D, where D=(G_D,S) is the dual map of M. We prove that Im(c_P \circ c_{P^\sim}) is the intersection of the cycle spaces of G_M and G_D, and that the dimension of this subspace is connectivity of S. Finally, if M has also a single face, this face induces a linear transformation c_D which is invertible: we show that c_D^{-1} = c_{P^\sim}.
