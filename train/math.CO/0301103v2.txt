We present an elementary method for proving enumeration formulas which are polynomials in certain parameters if others are fixed and factorize into distinct linear factors over Z. Roughly speaking the idea is to prove such formulas by ``explaining'' their zeros using an appropriate combinatorial extension of the objects under consideration to negative integer parameters. We apply this method to prove a new refinement of the Bender-Knuth (ex-)Conjecture, which easily implies the Bender-Knuth (ex-)Conjecture itself. This is probably the most elementary way to prove this result currently known. Furthermore we adapt our method to q-polynomials, which allows us to derive generating function results as well. Finally we use this method to give another proof for the enumeration of semistandard tableaux of a fixed shape, which is opposed to the Bender-Knuth (ex-)Conjecture refinement a multivariate application of our method.
