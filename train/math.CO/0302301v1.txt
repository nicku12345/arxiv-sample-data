Let A_n\subseteq S_n denote the alternating and the symmetric groups on 1,...,n. MacMahaon's theorem, about the equi-distribution of the length and the major indices in S_n, has received far reaching refinements and generalizations, by Foata, Carlitz, Foata-Schutzenberger, Garsia-Gessel and followers. Our main goal is to find analogous statistics and identities for the alternating group A_{n}. A new statistic for S_n, {\it the delent number}, is introduced. This new statistic is involved with new S_n equi-distribution identities, refining some of the results of Foata-Schutzenberger and Garsia-Gessel. By a certain covering map f:A_{n+1}\to S_n, such S_n identities are `lifted' to A_{n+1}, yielding the corresponding A_{n+1} equi-distribution identities.
