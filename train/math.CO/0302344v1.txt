We first prove that the set of domino tilings of a fixed finite figure is a distributive lattice, even in the case when the figure has holes. We then give a geometrical interpretation of the order given by this lattice, using (not necessarily local) transformations called {\em flips}.   This study allows us to formulate an exhaustive generation algorithm and a uniform random sampling algorithm.   We finally extend these results to other types of tilings (calisson tilings, tilings with bicolored Wang tiles).
