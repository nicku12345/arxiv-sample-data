We introduce the Orchard crossing number, which is defined in a similar way to the well-known rectilinear crossing number. We compute the Orchard crossing number for some simple families of graphs. We also prove some properties of this crossing number.   Moreover, we define a variant of this crossing number which is tightly connected to the rectilinear crossing number, and compute it for some simple families of graphs.
