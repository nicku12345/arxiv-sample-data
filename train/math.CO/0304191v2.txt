Using the formalism of noncommutative symmetric functions, we derive the basic theory of the peak algebra of symmetric groups and of its graded Hopf dual. Our main result is to provide a representation theoretical interpretation of the peak algebra and its graded dual as Grothendieck rings of the tower of Hecke-Clifford algebras at q=0.
