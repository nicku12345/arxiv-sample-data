In this paper we develop a theory of convexity for a free Abelian group M (the lattice of integer points), which we call theory of discrete convexity. We characterize those subsets X of the group M that could be call "convex". One property seems indisputable: X should coincide with the set of all integer points of its convex hull co(X) (in the ambient vector space V). However, this is a first approximation to a proper discrete convexity, because such non-intersecting sets need not be separated by a hyperplane. This issue is closely related to the question when the intersection of two integer polyhedra is an integer polyhedron. We show that unimodular systems (or more generally, pure systems) are in one-to-one correspondence with the classes of discrete convexity. For example, the well-known class of g-polymatroids corresponds to the class of discrete convexity associated to the unimodular system A_n:={\pm e_i, e_i-ej} in Z^n.
