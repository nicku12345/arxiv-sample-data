Let T_n be the set of 321-avoiding permutations of order n. Two properties of T_n are proved: (1) The {\em last descent} and {\em last index minus one} statistics are equidistributed over T_n, and also over subsets of permutations whose inverse has an (almost) prescribed descent set. An analogous result holds for Dyck paths. (2) The sign-and-last-descent enumerators for T_{2n} and T_{2n+1} are essentially equal to the last-descent enumerator for T_n. The proofs use a recursion formula for an appropriate multivariate generating function.
