Assume K is a convex body in R^d, and X is a (large) finite subset of K. How many convex polytopes are there whose vertices come from X? What is the typical shape of such a polytope? How well the largest such polytope (which is actually \conv X) approximates K? We are interested in these questions mainly in two cases. The first is when X is a random sample of n uniform, independent points from K and is motivated by Sylvester's four-point problem, and by the theory of random polytopes. The second case is when X=K \cap Z^d where Z^d is the lattice of integer points in R^d. Motivation comes from integer programming and geometry of numbers. The two cases behave quite similarly.
