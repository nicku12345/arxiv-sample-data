Ohba has conjectured \cite{ohb} that if the graph G has 2\chi(G)+1 or fewer vertices then the list chromatic number and chromatic number of G are equal. In this paper we prove that this conjecture is asymptotically correct. More precisely we obtain that for any 0<\epsilon<1, there exist an n_0=n_0(\epsilon) such that the list chromatic number of G equals its chromatic number, provided n_0 \leq |V(G) | \le (2-\epsilon)\chi(G).
