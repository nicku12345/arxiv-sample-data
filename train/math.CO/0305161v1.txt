In 1975, P. Erd\"{o}s proposed the problem of determining the maximum number f(n) of edges in a graph of n vertices in which any two cycles are of different lengths. In this paper, it is proved that f(n)\geq n+36t for t=1260r+169 (r\geq 1) and n \geq 540t^{2}+{175811/2}t+{7989/2}. Consequently, \liminf\sb {n \to \infty} {f(n)-n \over \sqrt n} \geq \sqrt {2 + {2 \over 5}}. We make the following conjecture:   \par \bigskip \noindent{\bf Conjecture.} \lim_{n \to \infty} {f(n)-n\over \sqrt n}=\sqrt {2.4}.
