The n'th Birkhoff polytope B_n is the set of all doubly stochastic n \times n matrices, that is, those matrices with nonnegative real coefficients in which every row and column sums to one. A long-standing open problem is the determination of the relative volume of B_n. In [arXiv:math.CO/0202267] we introduced a method of calculating this volume and used it to compute \vol B_9. This note is an update on our progress: with the same program (but much longer computing time), we have now derived \vol B_{10}.
