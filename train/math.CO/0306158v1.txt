Can the vertices of a graph G be partitioned into A \cup B, so that G[A] is a line-graph and G[B] is a forest? Can G be partitioned into a planar graph and a perfect graph? The NP-completeness of these problems are just special cases of our result: if {\cal P} and {\cal Q} are additive induced-hereditary graph properties, then ({\cal P}, {\cal Q})-colouring is NP-hard, with the sole exception of graph 2-colouring (the case where both \cal P and \cal Q are the set {\cal O} of finite edgeless graphs). Moreover, ({\cal P}, {\cal Q})-colouring is NP-complete iff {\cal P}- and {\cal Q}-recognition are both in NP. This proves a conjecture of Kratochv\'{\i}l and Schiermeyer.
