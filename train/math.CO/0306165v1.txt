An additive hereditary graph property is a set of graphs, closed under isomorphism and under taking subgraphs and disjoint unions. Let {\cal P}_1, >..., {\cal P}_n be additive hereditary graph properties. A graph G has property ({\cal P}_1 \circ ... \circ {\cal P}_n) if there is a partition (V_1, ..., V_n) of V(G) into n sets such that, for all i, the induced subgraph G[V_i] is in {\cal P}_i. A property {\cal P} is reducible if there are properties {\cal Q}, {\cal R} such that {\cal P} = {\cal Q} \circ {\cal R}; otherwise it is irreducible. Mih\'{o}k, Semani\v{s}in and Vasky [J. Graph Theory {\bf 33} (2000), 44--53] gave a factorisation for any additive hereditary property {\cal P} into a given number dc({\cal P}) of irreducible additive hereditary factors. Mih\'{o}k [Discuss. Math. Graph Theory {\bf 20} (2000), 143--153] gave a similar factorisation for properties that are additive and induced-hereditary (closed under taking induced-subgraphs and disjoint unions). Their results left open the possiblity of different factorisations, maybe even with a different number of factors; we prove here that the given factorisations are, in fact, unique.
