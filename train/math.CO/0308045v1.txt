A graph property (i.e., a set of graphs) is induced-hereditary or additive if it is closed under taking induced-subgraphs or disjoint unions. If \cP and \cQ are properties, the product \cP \circ \cQ consists of all graphs G for which there is a partition of the vertex set of G into (possibly empty) subsets A and B with G[A] \in \cP and G[B] \in \cQ. A property is reducible if it is the product of two other properties, and irreducible otherwise.   We completely describe the few reducible induced-hereditary properties that have a unique factorisation into irreducibles. Analogs of compositive and additive induced-hereditary properties are introduced and characterised in the style of Scheinerman [{\em Discrete Math}. {\bf 55} (1985) 185--193]. One of these provides an alternative proof that an additive hereditary property factors into irreducible additive hereditary properties.
