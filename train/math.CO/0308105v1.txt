A sequence S is potentially K_4-e graphical if it has a realization containing a K_4-e as a subgraph. Let \sigma(K_4-e, n) denote the smallest degree sum such that every n-term graphical sequence S with \sigma(S)\geq \sigma(K_4-e, n) is potentially K_4-e graphical. Gould, Jacobson, Lehel raised the problem of determining the value of \sigma (K_4-e, n). In this paper, we prove that \sigma (K_4-e, n)=2[(3n-1)/2] for n\geq 7, and n=4,5, and \sigma(K_4-e, 6)= 20.
