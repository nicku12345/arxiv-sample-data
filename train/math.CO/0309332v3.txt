We present a new tool to compute the number \phi_\A (\b) of integer solutions to the linear system  \x \geq 0 \qquad \A \x = \b  where the coefficients of \A and \b are integral. \phi_\A (\b) is often described as a \emph{vector partition function}. Our methods use partial fraction expansions of Euler's generating function for \phi_\A (\b). A special class of vector partition functions are Ehrhart (quasi-)polynomials counting integer points in dilated polytopes.
