It is shown that the descending plane partitions of Andrews can be geometrically realized as cyclically symmetric rhombus tilings of a certain hexagon where an equilateral triangle of side length 2 has been removed from its centre. Thus, the lattice structure for descending plane partitions, as introduced by Mills, Robbins and Rumsey, allows for an elegant visualization.
