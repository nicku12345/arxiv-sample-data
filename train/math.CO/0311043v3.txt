This paper summarizes some known results about Appell polynomials and investigates their various analogs. The primary of these are the free Appell polynomials. In the multivariate case, they can be considered as natural analogs of the Appell polynomials among polynomials in non-commuting variables. They also fit well into the framework of free probability. For the free Appell polynomials, a number of combinatorial and "diagram" formulas are proven, such as the formulas for their linearization coefficients. An explicit formula for their generating function is obtained. These polynomials are also martingales for free Levy processes. For more general free Sheffer families, a necessary condition for pseudo-orthogonality is given. Another family investigated are the Kailath-Segall polynomials. These are multivariate polynomials, which share with the Appell polynomials nice combinatorial properties, but are always orthogonal. Their origins lie in the Fock space representations, or in the theory of multiple stochastic integrals. Diagram formulas are proven for these polynomials as well, even in the q-deformed case.
