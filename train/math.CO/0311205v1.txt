The convolved Fibonacci numbers F_j^(r) are defined by   (1-z-z^2)^{-r}=\sum_{j>=0}F_{j+1}^(r)z^j. In this note some related numbers that can be expressed in terms of convolved Fibonacci numbers are considered. These numbers appear in the numerical evaluation of a certain number theoretical constant.   This note is a case study of the transform {1/n}\sum_{d|n}mu(d)f(z^d)^{n/d}, with f any formal series and mu the Moebius function), which is studied in a companion paper entitled `The formal series Witt transform'.
