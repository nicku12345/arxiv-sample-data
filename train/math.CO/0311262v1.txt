We introduce a notion of lexicographic shellability for pure, balanced boolean cell complexes, modelled after the CL-shellability criterion of Bj\"orner and Wachs for posets and its generalization by Kozlov called CC-shellability. We give a lexicographic shelling for the quotient of the order complex of a Boolean algebra of rank 2n by the action of the wreath product S_2\wr S_n of symmetric groups, and we provide a partitioning for the quotient complex \Delta (\Pi_n)/S_n .   Stanley asked for a description of the symmetric group representation \beta_S  on the homology of the rank-selected partition lattice \Pi_n^S  in [St2], and in particular he asked when the multiplicity b_S(n) of the trivial representation in \beta_S is 0. One consequence of the partitioning for \dps  is a (fairly complicated) combinatorial interpretation for b_S(n) ; another is a simple proof of Hanlon's result that b_{1,..., i}(n)=0. Using a result of Garsia and Stanton, we deduce from our shelling for \Delta (B_{2n})/S_2 \wr S_n that the ring of invariants k[x_1,..., x_{2n}]^{S_2\wr S_n} is Cohen-Macaulay over any field k.
