This paper verifies a conjecture of Edelman and Reiner regarding the homology of the h-complex of a Boolean algebra. A discrete Morse function with no low-dimensional critical cells is constructed, implying a lower bound on connectivity. This together with an Alexander duality result of Edelman and Reiner implies homology-vanishing also in high dimensions. Finally, possible generalizations to certain classes of supersolvable lattices are suggested.
