We construct error correcting nonlinear binary codes using a construction of Bose and Chowla in additive number theory. Our method extends a construction of Graham and Sloane for constant weight codes. The new codes improve 1028 of the 7168 best known h-error correcting codes of wordlength at most 512 and h at most 14. We give assymptotical comparisons to shortened BCH codes. Tables of new lower bounds for "A(n,d)" are included.
