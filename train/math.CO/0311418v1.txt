Motivated by Stanley's results in \cite{St02}, we generalize the rank of a partition \lambda to the rank of a shifted partition S(\lambda). We show that the number of bars required in a minimal bar tableau of S(\lambda) is max(o, e + (\ell(\lambda) \mathrm{mod} 2)), where o and e are the number of odd and even rows of \lambda. As a consequence we show that the irreducible projective characters of S_n vanish on certain conjugacy classes. Another corollary is a lower bound on the degree of the terms in the expansion of Schur's Q_{\lambda} symmetric functions in terms of the power sum symmetric functions.
