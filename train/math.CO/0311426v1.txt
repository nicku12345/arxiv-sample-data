In this paper, we first give formulas for the order polynomial \Omega (\Pw; t) and the Eulerian polynomial e(\Pw; \lambda) of a finite labeled poset (P, \omega) using the adjacency matrix of what we call the \omega-graph of (P, \omega). We then derive various recursion formulas for \Omega (\Pw; t) and e(\Pw; \lambda) and discuss some applications of these formulas to Bernoulli numbers and Bernoulli polynomials. Finally, we give a recursive algorithm using a single linear operator on a vector space. This algorithm provides a uniform method to construct a family of new invariants for labeled posets (\Pw), which includes the order polynomial \Omega (\Pw; t) and the invariant \tilde e(\Pw; \lambda) =\frac {e(\Pw; \lambda)}{(1-\lambda)^{|P|+1}}. The well-known quasi-symmetric function invariant of labeled posets and a further generalization of our construction are also discussed.
