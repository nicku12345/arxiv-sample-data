Let H be a fixed graph. A {\em fractional H-decomposition} of a graph G is an assignment of nonnegative real weights to the copies of H in G such that for each e \in E(G), the sum of the weights of copies of H containing e in precisely one. An {\em H-packing} of a graph G is a set of edge disjoint copies of H in G. The following results are proved. For every fixed k > 2, every graph with n vertices and minimum degree at least n(1-1/9k^{10})+o(n) has a fractional K_k-decomposition and has a K_k-packing which covers all but o(n^2) edges.
