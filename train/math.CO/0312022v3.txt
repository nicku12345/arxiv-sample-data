We present a new explicit construction for expander graphs with nearly optimal spectral gap. The construction is based on a series of 2-lift operations.   Let G be a graph on n vertices. A 2-lift of G is a graph H on 2n vertices, with a covering map \pi:H \to G. It is not hard to see that all eigenvalues of G are also eigenvalues of H. In addition, H has n ``new'' eigenvalues. We conjecture that every d-regular graph has a 2-lift such that all new eigenvalues are in the range [-2\sqrt{d-1},2\sqrt{d-1}] (If true, this is tight, e.g. by the Alon-Boppana bound). Here we show that every graph of maximal degree d has a 2-lift such that all ``new'' eigenvalues are in the range [-c \sqrt{d \log^3d}, c \sqrt{d \log^3d}] for some constant c. This leads to a polynomial time algorithm for constructing arbitrarily large d-regular graphs, with second eigenvalue O(\sqrt{d \log^3 d}).   The proof uses the following lemma: Let A be a real symmetric matrix such that the l_1 norm of each row in A is at most d. Let \alpha = \max_{x,y \in \{0,1\}^n, supp(x)\cap supp(y)=\emptyset} \frac {|xAy|} {||x||||y||}. Then the spectral radius of A is at most c \alpha \log(d/\alpha), for some universal constant c.   An interesting consequence of this lemma is a converse to the Expander Mixing Lemma.
