We use the Cayley Trick to study polyhedral subdivisions of the product of two simplices. For arbitrary (fixed) l, we show that the numbers of regular and non-regular triangulations of \Delta^l\times\Delta^k grow, respectively, as k^{\Theta(k)} and 2^{\Omega(k^2)}.   For the special case of l=2, we relate triangulations to certain class of lozenge tilings. This allows us to compute the exact number of triangulations up to k=15, show that the number grows as e^{\beta k^2/2 + o(k^2)} where \beta\simeq 0.32309594 and prove that the set of all triangulations is connected under geometric bistellar flips. The latter has as a corollary that the toric Hilbert scheme of the determinantal ideal of 2\times 2 minors of a 3\times k matrix is connected, for every k.   We include ``Cayley Trick pictures'' of all the triangulations of \Delta^2\times \Delta^2 and \Delta^2\times \Delta^3, as well as one non-regular triangulation of \Delta^2\times \Delta^5 and one of \Delta^3\times \Delta^3.
