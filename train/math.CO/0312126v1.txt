If the moments of a probability measure on \R are interpreted as a specialization of complete homogeneous symmetric functions, its free cumulants are, up to sign, the corresponding specializations of a sequence of Schur positive symmetric functions (f_n). We prove that (f_n) is the Frobenius characteristic of the natural permutation representation of \SG_n on the set of prime parking functions. This observation leads us to the construction of a Hopf algebra of parking functions, which we study in some detail.
