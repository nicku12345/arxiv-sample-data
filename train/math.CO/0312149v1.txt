Let G denote a near-polygon distance-regular graph with diameter d\geq 3, valency k and intersection numbers a_1>0, c_2>1. Let \theta_1 denote the second largest eigenvalue for the adjacency matrix of G. We show \theta_1 is at most (k-a_1-c_2)/(c_2-1). We show the following are equivalent: (i) Equality is attained above; (ii) G is Q-polynomial with respect to \theta_1; (iii) G is a dual polar graph or a Hamming graph.
