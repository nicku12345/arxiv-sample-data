Let G denote a distance-regular graph with diameter D\ge 3, valency k, and intersection numbers a_i, b_i, c_i. By a {\it pseudo cosine sequence} of G we mean a sequence of real numbers s_0, s_1, ..., s_D such that s_0=1 and c_i s_{i-1}+a_i s_i+b_i s_{i+1}=k s_1 s_i for  0 \le i \le D-1. Let s_0, s_1,..., s_D and p_0, p_1, ..., p_D denote pseudo cosine sequences of G. We say this pair of sequences is {\it tight} whenever s_0 p_0, s_1 p_1, ..., s_D p_D is a pseudo cosine sequence of G. In this paper, we determine all the tight pairs of pseudo cosine sequences of G.
