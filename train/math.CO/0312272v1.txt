In this article we extend the idea of Turbo codes onto the Real Field. The channel is taken to result in block erasures and the only noise as being that due to quantization. The decoding in this case is reduced to reconstruction of the lost values. The encoding is done using critically sampled filter banks and introduction of an interleaver is found to reduce the mean square quantization error drastically. The permutation that gives the best recoverability is obtained in the 2 Channel case. Results are also obtained for M channel case. The algorithm for reconstruction of the lost values in the absence of quantization noise is obtained.
