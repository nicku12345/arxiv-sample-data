We study the determinant of the pxp circulant matrix whose first row is (1,-x,0,...,0,-y,0,...,0), the -y being in position q+1. The coefficients of this polynomial are integers that count certain classes of permutations. We show that all of the permutations that contribute to a fixed monomial x^ry^s have the same sign, and we determine that sign. We prove that a monomial x^ry^s appears if and only if p divides r+sq. Finally, we show that the size of the largest coefficient of the monomials that appear grows exponentially with p. We do this by proving that the permanent of the circulant whose first row is (1,1,0,...,0,1,0,...,0) is the sum of the absolute values of the coefficients of the monomials in the original determinant.
