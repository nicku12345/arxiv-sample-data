We study generating functions for the number of involutions, even involutions, and odd involutions in S_n subject to two restrictions. One restriction is that the involution avoid 3412 or contain 3412 exactly once. The other restriction is that the involution avoid another pattern \tau or contain \tau exactly once. In many cases we express these generating functions in terms of Chebyshev polynomials of the second kind.
