Some enumerative aspects of the fans, called generalized associahedra, introduced by S. Fomin and A. Zelevinsky in their theory of cluster algebras are considered, in relation with a bicomplex and its two spectral sequences. A precise enumerative relation with the lattices of generalized noncrossing partitions is conjectured and some evidence is given.
