A convex triangular grid is represented by a planar digraph G embedded in the plane so that (a) each bounded face is surrounded by three edges and forms an equilateral triangle, and (b) the union \Rscr of bounded faces is a convex polygon. A real-valued function h on the edges of G is called a concave cocirculation if h(e)=g(v)-g(u) for each edge e=(u,v), where g is a concave function on \Rscr which is affinely linear within each bounded face of G. Knutson and Tao [J. Amer. Math. Soc. 12 (4) (1999) 1055--1090] proved an integrality theorem for so-called honeycombs, which is equivalent to the assertion that an integer-valued function on the boundary edges of G is extendable to an integer concave cocirculation if it is extendable to a concave cocirculation at all. In this paper we show a sharper property: for any concave cocirculation h in G, there exists an integer concave cocirculation h' satisfying h'(e)=h(e) for each boundary edge e with h(e) integer and for each edge e contained in a bounded face where h takes integer values on all edges. On the other hand, we explain that for a 3-side grid G of size n, the polytope of concave cocirculations with fixed integer values on two sides of G can have a vertex h whose entries are integers on the third side but h(e) has denominator \Omega(n) for some interior edge e. Also some algorithmic aspects and related results on honeycombs are discussed.
