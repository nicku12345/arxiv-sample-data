The Ehrhart polynomial of a convex lattice polytope counts integer points in integral dilates of the polytope. We present new linear inequalities satisfied by the coefficients of Ehrhart polynomials and relate them to known inequalities. We also investigate the roots of Ehrhart polynomials. We prove that for fixed d, there exists a bounded region of C containing all roots of Ehrhart polynomials of d-polytopes, and that all real roots of these polynomials lie in [-d, [d/2]). In contrast, we prove that when the dimension d is not fixed the positive real roots can be arbitrarily large. We finish with an experimental investigation of the Ehrhart polynomials of cyclic polytopes and 0/1-polytopes.
