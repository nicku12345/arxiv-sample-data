For an element w in the Weyl algebra generated by D and U with relation DU=UD+1, the normally ordered form is w=\sum c_{i,j}U^iD^j. We demonstrate that the normal order coefficients c_{i,j} of a word w are rook numbers on a Ferrers board. We use this interpretation to give a new proof of the rook factorization theorem, which we use to provide an explicit formula for the coefficients c_{i,j}. We calculate the Weyl binomial coefficients: normal order coefficients of the element (D+U)^n in the Weyl algebra. We extend all these results to the q-analogue of the Weyl algebra. We discuss further generalizations using i-rook numbers.
