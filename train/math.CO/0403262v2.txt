Lin and Chang gave a generating function of convex polyominoes with an m+1 by n+1 minimal bounding rectangle. Gessel showed that their result implies that the number of such polyominoes is  \frac{m+n+mn}{m+n}{2m+2n\choose 2m}-\frac{2mn}{m+n}{m+n\choose m}^2.  We show that this result can be derived from some binomial coefficients identities related to the generating function of Jacobi polynomials.
