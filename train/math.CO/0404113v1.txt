In this paper, a result of Albert, Atkinson, Handley, Holton, and Stromquist [Electron. J. Combin. 9 (2002), #R5] which characterizes the optimal packing behavior of the pattern 1243 is generalized in two directions. The packing densities of layered patterns of type (1^a,a) and (1,1,b) are computed.
