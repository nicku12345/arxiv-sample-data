The generating functions of the major index and of the flag-major index, with each of the one-dimensional characters over the symmetric and hyperoctahedral group, respectively, have simple product formulas. In this paper, we give a factorial-type formula for the generating function of the D-major index with sign over the Weyl groups of type D. This completes a picture which is now known for all the classical Weyl groups.
