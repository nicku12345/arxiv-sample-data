We give an extension of the lower bound of Vucic and Zivaljevic for the number of Tverberg partitions from the prime to the prime power case. Our proof is inspired by the Z_p-index version of the proof in Matousek's book "Using the Borsuk-Ulam Theorem" and uses Volovikov's Lemma. Analogously, one obtains an extension of the lower bound for the number of different splittings of a generic necklace to the prime power case.
