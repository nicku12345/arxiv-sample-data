Let d, r \in \N, \|\cdot\| any norm on \R^d and B denote the unit ball with respect to this norm. We show that any sequence v_1,v_2,... of vectors in B can be partitioned into r subsequences V_1, ..., V_r in a balanced manner with respect to the partial sums: For all n \in \N, \ell \le r, we have \|\sum_{i \le k, v_i \in V_\ell} v_i - \tfrac 1r \sum_{i \le k} v_i\| \le 2.0005 d. A similar bound holds for partitioning sequences of vector sets. Both results extend an earlier one of B\'ar\'any and Grinberg (1981) to partitions in arbitrarily many classes.
