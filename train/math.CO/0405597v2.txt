We introduce analogues of the Hopf algebra of Free quasi-symmetric functions with bases labelled by colored permutations. As applications, we recover in a simple way the descent algebras associated with wreath products \Gamma\wr\SG_n and the corresponding generalizations of quasi-symmetric functions. Also, we obtain Hopf algebras of colored parking functions, colored non-crossing partitions and parking functions of type B.
