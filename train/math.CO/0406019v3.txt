We generalize the notion of graded posets to what we call sign-graded (labeled) posets. We prove that the W-polynomial of a sign-graded poset is symmetric and unimodal. This extends a recent result of Reiner and Welker who proved it for graded posets by associating a simplicial polytopal sphere to each graded poset P. By proving that the W-polynomials of sign-graded posets has the right sign at -1, we are able to prove the Charney-Davis Conjecture for these spheres (whenever they are flag).
