In this note we answer a question of Hurlbert about pebbling in graphs of high girth. Specifically we show that for every g there is a Class 0 graph of girth at least g. The proof uses the so-called Erdos construction and employs a recent result proved by Czygrinow, Hurlbert, Kierstead and Trotter. We also use the Czygrinow et al. result to prove that Graham's pebbling product conjecture holds for dense graphs. Finally, we consider a generalization of Graham's conjecture to thresholds of graph sequences and find reasonably tight bounds on the pebbling threshold of the sequence of d-dimensional grids, verifying an important instance the generalization.
