For z_1,z_2,z_3 \in \Z^n, the \emph{tristance} d_3(z_1,z_2,z_3) is a generalization of the L_1-distance on \Z^n to a quantity that reflects the relative dispersion of three points rather than two. A tristance anticode \cA_d of diameter d is a subset of \Z^n with the property that d_3(z_1,z_2,z_3) \leq d for all z_1,z_2,z_3 \in \cA_d. An anticode is optimal if it has the largest possible cardinality for its diameter d.   We determine the cardinality and completely classify the optimal tristance anticodes in \Z^2 for all diameters d \ge 1. We then generalize this result to two related distance models: a different distance structure on \Z^2 where d(z_1,z_2) = 1 if z_1,z_2 are adjacent either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, and the distance structure obtained when \Z^2 is replaced by the hexagonal lattice A_2. We also investigate optimal tristance anticodes in \Z^3 and optimal quadristance anticodes in \Z^2, and provide bounds on their cardinality. We conclude with a brief discussion of the applications of our results to multi-dimensional interleaving schemes and to connectivity loci in the game of Go.
