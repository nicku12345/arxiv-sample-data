Consider the 2n-by-2n matrix M=(m_{i,j})_{i,j=1}^{2n} with m_{i,j} = 1 for i,j satisfying |2i-2n-1|+|2j-2n-1| \leq 2n and m_{i,j} = 0 for all other i,j, consisting of a central diamond of 1's surrounded by 0's. When n \geq 4, the \lambda-determinant of the matrix M (as introduced by Robbins and Rumsey) is not well-defined. However, if we replace the 0's by t's, we get a matrix whose \lambda-determinant is well-defined and is a polynomial in \lambda and t. The limit of this polynomial as t \to 0 is a polynomial in \lambda whose value at \lambda=1 is the number of domino tilings of a 2n-by-2n square.
