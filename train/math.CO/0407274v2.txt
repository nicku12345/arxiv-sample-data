In this paper, we present an elementary proof of a theorem of Serre concerning the greatest eigenvalues of k-regular graphs. We also prove an analogue of Serre's theorem regarding the least eigenvalues of k-regular graphs: given \epsilon>0, there exist a positive constant c=c(\epsilon,k) and a nonnegative integer g=g(\epsilon,k) such that for any k-regular graph X with no odd cycles of length less than g, the number of eigenvalues \mu of X such that \mu \leq -(2-\epsilon)\sqrt{k-1} is at least c|X|. This implies a result of Winnie Li.
