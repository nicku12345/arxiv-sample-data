Let P be a polygon whose vertices have been colored (labeled) cyclically with the numbers 1,2,...,c. Motivated by conjectures of Propp, we are led to consider partitions of P into k-gons which are proper in the sense that each k-gon contains all c colors on its vertices. Counting the number of proper partitions involves a generalization of the k-Catalan numbers. We also show that in certain cases, any proper partition can be obtained from another by a sequence of moves called flips.
