R. Redheffer described an n\times n matrix of 0's and 1's the size of whose determinant is connected to the Riemann Hypothesis. We describe the permutations that contribute to its determinant and evaluate its permanent in terms of integer factorizations. We generalize the Redheffer matrix to finite posets that have a 0 element and find the analogous results in the more general situation.
