A sequence S is potentially K_{p,1,1} graphical if it has a realization containing a K_{p,1,1} as a subgraph, where K_{p,1,1} is a complete 3-partite graph with partition sizes p,1,1. Let \sigma(K_{p,1,1}, n) denote the smallest degree sum such that every n-term graphical sequence S with \sigma(S)\geq \sigma(K_{p,1,1}, n) is potentially K_{p,1,1} graphical. In this paper, we prove that \sigma (K_{p,1,1}, n)\geq 2[((p+1)(n-1)+2)/2] for n \geq p+2. We conjecture that equality holds for n \geq 2p+4. We prove that this conjecture is true for p=3.
