A sequence S is potentially K_{p_{1},p_{2},...,p_{t}} graphical if it has a realization containing a K_{p_{1},p_{2},...,p_{t}} as a subgraph, where K_{p_{1},p_{2},...,p_{t}} is a complete t-partite graph with partition sizes p_{1},p_{2},...,p_{t} (p_{1}\geq p_{2}\geq ...\geq p_{t} \geq 1). Let \sigma(K_{p_{1},p_{2},...,p_{t}}, n) denote the smallest degree sum such that every n-term graphical sequence S with \sigma(S)\geq \sigma(K_{p_{1},p_{2},...,p_{t}}, n) is potentially K_{p_{1},p_{2},...,p_{t}} graphical. In this paper, we prove that \sigma (K_{p_{1},p_{2},...,p_{t}}, n)\geq 2[((2p_{1}+2p_{2}+...+2p_{t}-p_{1}-p_{2}-...-p_{i}-2)n -(p_{1}+p_{2}+...+p_{t}-p_{i})(p_{i}+p_{i+1}+...+p_{t}-1)+2)/2] for n \geq p_{1}+p_{2}+...+p_{t}, i=2,3,...,t.
