A sequence S is potentially K_{m}-C_{4}-graphical if it has a realization containing a K_{m}-C_{4} as a subgraph. Let \sigma(K_{m}-C_{4}, n) denote the smallest degree sum such that every n-term graphical sequence S with \sigma(S)\geq \sigma(K_{m}-C_{4}, n) is potentially K_{m}-C_{4}-graphical. In this paper, we prove that \sigma (K_{m}-C_{4}, n)\geq (2m-6)n-(m-3)(m-2)+2, for n \geq m \geq 4. We conjecture that equality holds for n \geq m \geq 4. We prove that this conjecture is true for m=5.
