We construct a subalgebra of dimension 2.3^{n-1} of the group algebra of a Weyl group of type B_n containing its Solomon descent's algebra but also the Solomon's descent algebra of the symmetric group. This lead us to a construction of the irreducible characters of the hyperoctahedral groups by using a generalized plactic equivalence.
