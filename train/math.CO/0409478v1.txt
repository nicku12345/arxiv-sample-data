The galaxies of nonstandard enlargements of conventionally infinite as well as of transfinite graphs are defined, analyzed, and illustrated by some examples. It is then shown that any such enlargement either has exactly one galaxy, its principal one, or it has infinitely many galaxies. In the latter case, the galaxies are partially ordered by their "closeness" to the principal galaxy. If an enlargement has a galaxy different from its principal galaxy, then it has a two-way infinite sequence of galaxies that are totally ordered according to that "closeness" property. There may be many such totally ordered sequences.
