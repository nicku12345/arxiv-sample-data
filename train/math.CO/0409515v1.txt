In a prior work, the galaxies of the nonstandard enlargements of conventionally infinite graphs and also of transfinite graphs of the first rank of transfiniteness were defined, examined, and illustrated by some examples. In this work it is shown how the results of the prior work extend to graphs of higher ranks.
