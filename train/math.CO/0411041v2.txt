We shall work with the so called duality triads following kwa\'sniewski. In particular in this note we propose some extensions of them - hence we choose such special class of triads that admit - all at once - a unified combinatorial interpretation in a way konvalina does. The proposed extensions contain also definition of operator valued arrays of konvalina-like coefficients - for the sake of future investigation and applications.
