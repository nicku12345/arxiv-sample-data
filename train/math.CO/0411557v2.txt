In this paper we highlight some enumerative results concerning matroids of low rank and prove the tail-ends of various sequences involving the number of matroids on a finite set to be log-convex. We give a recursion for a new, slightly improved, lower bound on the number of rank-r matroids on n elements when n=2^m-1. We also prove an adjacent result showing the point-lines-planes conjecture to be true if and only if it is true for a special subcollection of matroids. Two new tables are also presented, giving the number of paving matroids on at most eight elements.
