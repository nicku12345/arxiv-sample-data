Let W be a Weyl group corresponding to the root system A_{n-1} or B_n.   We define a simplicial complex  \Delta^m_W  in terms of polygon dissections for such a group and any positive integer m. For  m=1 ,  \Delta^m_W is isomorphic to the cluster complex corresponding to  W , defined in \cite{FZ}. We enumerate the faces of  \Delta^m_W  and show that the entries of its h-vector are given by the generalized Narayana numbers  N^m_W(i) , defined in \cite{Atha3}. We also prove that for any  m \geq 1 the complex  \Delta^m_W  is shellable and hence Cohen-Macaulay.
