A new q-analog of Genocchi numbers is introduced through a q-analog of Seidel's triangle associated to Genocchi numbers. It is then shown that these q-Genocchi numbers have interesting combinatorial interpretations in the classical models for Genocchi numbers such as alternating pistols, alternating permutations, non intersecting lattice paths and skew Young tableaux.
