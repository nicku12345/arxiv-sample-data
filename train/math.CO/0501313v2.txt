Let n be a large integer and M_n be a random n by n matrix whose entries are i.i.d. Bernoulli random variables (each entry is \pm 1 with probability 1/2). We show that the probability that M_n is singular is at most (3/4 +o(1))^n, improving an earlier estimate of Kahn, Koml\'os and Szemer\'edi, as well as earlier work by the authors. The key new ingredient is the applications of Freiman type inverse theorems and other tools from additive combinatorics.
