The Foata bijection \Phi : S_n \to S_n is extended to the bijections \Psi : A_{n+1} \to A_{n+1} and \Psi_q : S_{n+q-1} \to S_{n+q-1}, where S_m, A_m are the symmetric and the alternating groups. These bijections imply bijective proofs for recent equidistribution theorems, by Regev and Roichman, for A_{n+1} and for S_{n+q-1}.
