We construct (k+-1)-regular graphs which provide sequences of expanders by adding or substracting appropriate 1-factors from given sequences of k-regular graphs. We compute numerical examples in a few cases for which the given sequences are from the work of Lubotzky, Phillips, and Sarnak (with k-1 the order of a finite field). If k+1 = 7, our construction results in a sequence of 7-regular expanders with all spectral gaps at least about 1.52.
