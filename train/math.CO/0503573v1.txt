The group PGL(2,q) has an embedding into PGL(3,q) such that it acts as the group fixing a nonsingular conic in PG(2,q). This action affords a coherent configuration R(q) on the set L(q) of non-tangent lines of the conic. We show that the relations can be described by using the cross-ratio. Our results imply that the restrictions R_{+}(q) and R_{-}(q) to the sets L_{+}(q) of secant lines and to the set L_{-}(q) of exterior lines, respectively, are both association schemes; moreover, we show that the elliptic scheme R_{-}(q) is pseudocyclic.   We further show that the coherent configuration R(q^2) with q even allow certain fusions. These provide a 4-class fusion of the hyperbolic scheme R_{+}(q^2), and 3-class fusions and 2-class fusions (strongly regular graphs) of both schemes R_{+}(q^2) and R_{-}(q^2). The fusion results for the hyperbolic case are known, but our approach here as well as our results in the elliptic case are new.
