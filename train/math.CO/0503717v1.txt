We have conjectured that the constraint equations defined by a generic Laman graph are not soluble by radicals when the graph is 3-connected. We prove that this conjecture follows from the following simpler conjecture: the constraint equations defined by a generic Laman graph are not soluble by radicals if the graph does not contain a proper subgraph which is itself a Laman graph.
