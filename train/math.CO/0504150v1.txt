This report is an improvement of a prior report (Report 813). It sharpens the principal theorems (Theorems 4.2 and 11.2 of Report 813) while simplifying their proofs. There are also several minor changes involving clarifications and corrections of misprints.   The Abstract of the prior report remains the same as follow: The galaxies of the nonstandard enlargements of connected, conventionally infinite graphs as well as of connected transfinite graphs are defined, analyzed, and illustrated by some examples. It is then shown that any such enlargement either has exactly one galaxy, its principal one, or it has infinitely many galaxies. In the latter case, the galaxies are partially ordered by their "closeness" to the principal galaxy. If an enlargement has a galaxy different from its principal galaxy, then it has a two-way infinite sequence of galaxies that are totally ordered according to that "closeness" property. There may be many such totally ordred sequences.
