A triangle \{a(n,k)\}_{0\le k\le n} of nonnegative numbers is LC-positive if for each r, the sequence of polynomials \sum_{k=r}^{n}a(n,k)q^k is q-log-concave. It is double LC-positive if both triangles \{a(n,k)\} and \{a(n,n-k)\} are LC-positive. We show that if \{a(n,k)\} is LC-positive then the log-concavity of the sequence \{x_k\} implies that of the sequence \{z_n\} defined by z_n=\sum_{k=0}^{n}a(n,k)x_k, and if \{a(n,k)\} is double LC-positive then the log-concavity of sequences \{x_k\} and \{y_k\} implies that of the sequence \{z_n\} defined by z_n=\sum_{k=0}^{n}a(n,k)x_ky_{n-k}. Examples of double LC-positive triangles include the constant triangle and the Pascal triangle. We also give a generalization of a result of Liggett that is used to prove a conjecture of Pemantle on characteristics of negative dependence.
