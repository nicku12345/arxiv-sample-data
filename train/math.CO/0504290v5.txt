For any Lie algebra of classical type or type G_2 we define a K-theoretic analog of Dunkl's elements, the so-called truncated {\it Ruijsenaars-Schneider-Macdonald elements}, RSM-elements for short, in the corresponding {\it Yang-Baxter group}, which form a commuting family of elements in the latter. For the root systems of type A we prove that the subalgebra of the {\it bracket algebra} generated by the RSM-elements is isomorphic to the Grothendieck ring of the flag variety. In general, we prove that the subalgebra generated by the {\it images} of the RSM-elements in the corresponding {\it Nichols-Woronowicz algebra} is canonically isomorphic to the Grothendieck ring of the corresponding flag varieties of classical type or of type G_2. In other words, we construct the ``Nichols-Woronowicz algebra model'' for the Grothendieck Calculus on Weyl groups of classical type or type G_2, providing a partial generalization of some recent results by Y. Bazlov. We also give a conjectural description (theorem for type A) of a commutative subalgebra generated by the {\it truncated RSM-elements} in the bracket algebra for the classical root systems. Our results provide a proof and generalizations of recent conjecture and result by C. Lenart and A. Yong for the root system of type A.
