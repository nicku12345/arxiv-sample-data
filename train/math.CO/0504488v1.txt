The rank of a skew partition \lambda/\mu, denoted rank(\lambda/\mu), is the smallest number r such that \lambda/\mu is a disjoint union of r border strips. Let s_{\lambda/\mu}(1^t) denote the skew Schur function s_{\lambda/\mu} evaluated at x_1=...=x_t=1, x_i=0 for i>t. The zrank of \lambda/\mu, denoted zrank(\lambda/\mu), is the exponent of the largest power of t dividing s_{\lambda/\mu}(1^t). Stanley conjectured that rank(\lambda/\mu)=zrank(\lambda/\mu). We show the equivalence between the validity of the zrank conjecture and the nonsingularity of restricted Cauchy matrices. In support of Stanley's conjecture we give affirmative answers for some special cases.
