We present a method to prove hypergeometric double summation identities. Given a hypergeometric term F(n,i,j), we aim to find a difference operator  L=a_0(n) N^0 + a_1(n) N^1 +...+a_r(n) N^r  and rational functions R_1(n,i,j),R_2(n,i,j) such that  L F = \Delta_i (R_1 F) + \Delta_j (R_2 F). Based on simple divisibility considerations, we show that the denominators of R_1 and R_2 must possess certain factors which can be computed from F(n, i,j). Using these factors as estimates, we may find the numerators of R_1 and R_2 by guessing the upper bounds of the degrees and solving systems of linear equations. Our method is valid for the Andrews-Paule identity, Carlitz's identities, the Ap\'ery-Schmidt-Strehl identity, the Graham-Knuth-Patashnik identity, and the Petkov\v{s}ek-Wilf-Zeilberger identity.
