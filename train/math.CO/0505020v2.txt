For a permutation \pi in the symmetric group S_n let the {\it total degree} be its valency in the Hasse diagram of the strong Bruhat order on S_n, and let the {\it down degree} be the number of permutations which are covered by \pi in the strong Bruhat order. The maxima of the total degree and the down degree and their values at a random permutation are computed. Proofs involve variants of a classical theorem of Tur\'an from extremal graph theory.
