We derive the continued fraction form of the generating function of some new q-analogs of the Eulerian numbers \hat{E}_{k,n}(q) introduced by Lauren Williams building on work of Alexander Postnikov. They are related to the number of alignments and weak exceedances of permutations. We show how these numbers are related to crossing and generalized patterns of permutations We generalize to the case of decorated permutations. Finally we show how these numbers appear naturally in the stationary distribution of the ASEP model.
