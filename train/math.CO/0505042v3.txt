A complete characterization of two functions f(x,y) and g(x,y) in the (f,g)-inversion is presented. As an application to the theory of hypergeometric series, a general bibasic summation formula determined by f(x,y) and g(x,y) as well as four arbitrary sequences is obtained which unifies Gasper and Rahman's, Chu's and Macdonald's bibasic summation formula. Furthermore, an alternative proof of the (f,g)-inversion derived from the (f,g)-summation formula is presented. A bilateral (f,g)-inversion containing Schlosser's bilateral matrix inversion as a special case is also obtained.
