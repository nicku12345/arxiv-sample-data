For a function g:\N\to \N, the \emph{g-regressive Ramsey number} of k is the least N so that \[N\stackrel \min \longrightarrow (k)_g\] . This symbol means: for every c:[N]^2\to \N that satisfies c(m,n)\le g(\min\{m,n\}) there is a \emph{min-homogeneous} H\su N of size k, that is, the color c(m,n) of a pair \{m,n\}\su H depends only on \min\{m,n\}. It is known (\cite{km,ks}) that \id-regressive Ramsey numbers grow in k as fast as \Ack(k), Ackermann's function in k. On the other hand, for constant g, the g-regressive Ramsey numbers grow exponentially in k, and are therefore primitive recursive in k.   We compute below the threshold in which g-regressive Ramsey numbers cease to be primitive recursive and become Ackermannian, by proving:   Suppose g:\N\to \N is weakly increasing. Then the g-regressive Ramsey numbers are primitive recursive if an only if for every t>0 there is some M_t so that for all n\ge M_t it holds that g(m)<n^{1/t} and M_t is bounded by a primitive recursive function in t.
