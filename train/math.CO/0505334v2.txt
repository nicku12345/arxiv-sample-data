We prove that for d\geq 3, the 1-skeleton of any (d-1)-dimensional doubly Cohen Macaulay (abbreviated 2-CM) complex is generically d-rigid. This implies the following two corollaries (by Kalai and Lee respectively): Barnette's lower bound inequalities for boundary complexes of simplicial polytopes hold for every 2-CM complex (of dimension \geq 2). Moreover, the initial part (g_0,g_1,g_2) of the g-vector of a 2-CM complex (of dimension \geq 3) is an M-sequence. It was conjectured by Bj\"{o}rner and Swartz that the entire g-vector of a 2-CM complex is an M-sequence.
