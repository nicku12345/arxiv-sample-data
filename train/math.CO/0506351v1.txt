A sequence of positive integers w_1,w_2,...,w_n is called an ascending wave if w_{i+1}-w_i \geq w_i - w_{i-1} for 2 \leq i \leq n-1. For integers k,r\geq1, let AW(k;r) be the least positive integer such that under any r-coloring of [1,AW(k;r)] there exists a k-term monochromatic ascending wave. The existence of AW(k;r) is guaranteed by van der Waerden's theorem on arithmetic progressions since an arithmetic progression is, itself, an ascending wave. Originally, Brown, Erd\H{o}s, and Freedman defined such sequences and proved that k^2-k+1\leq AW(k;2) \leq {1/3}(k^3-4k+9). Alon and Spencer then showed that AW(k;2) = O(k^3). In this article, we show that AW(k;3) = O(k^5) as well as offer a proof of the existence of AW(k;r) independent of van der Waerden's theorem. Furthermore, we prove that for any \epsilon > 0,  \frac{k^{2r-1-\epsilon}}{2^{r-1}(40r)^{r^2-1}}(1+o(1)) \leq AW(k;r) \leq \frac{k^{2r-1}}{(2r-1)!}(1+o(1))  holds for all r \geq 1, which, in particular, improves upon the best known upper bound for AW(k;2). Additionally, we show that for fixed k \geq 3,  AW(k;r)\leq\frac{2^{k-2}}{(k-1)!} r^{k-1}(1+o(1)).
