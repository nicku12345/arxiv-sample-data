Despite having been introduced in 1962 by C.L. Mallows, the combinatorial algorithm Patience Sorting is only now beginning to receive significant attention due to such recent deep results as the Baik-Deift-Johansson Theorem that connect it to fields including Probabilistic Combinatorics and Random Matrix Theory.   The aim of this work is to develop some of the more basic combinatorics of the Patience Sorting Algorithm. In particular, we exploit the similarities between Patience Sorting and the Schensted Insertion Algorithm in order to do things that include defining an analog of the Knuth relations and extending Patience Sorting to a bijection between permutations and certain pairs of set partitions. As an application of these constructions we characterize and enumerate the set S_n(3-\bar{1}-42) of permutations that avoid the generalized permutation pattern 2-31 unless it is part of the generalized pattern 3-1-42.
