A partition on [n] has a crossing if there exists i\_1<i\_2<j\_1<j\_2 such that i\_1 and j\_1 are in the same block, i\_2 and j\_2 are in the same block, but i\_1 and i\_2 are not in the same block. Recently, Chen et al. refined this classical notion by introducing k-crossings, for any integer k. In this new terminology, a classical crossing is a 2-crossing. The number of partitions of [n] avoiding 2-crossings is well-known to be the nth Catalan number C\_n={{2n}\choose n}/(n+1). This raises the question of counting k-noncrossing partitions for k\ge 3. We prove that the sequence counting 3-noncrossing partitions is P-recursive, that is, satisfies a linear recurrence relation with polynomial coefficients. We give explicitly such a recursion. However, we conjecture that k-noncrossing partitions are not P-recursive, for k\ge 4.
