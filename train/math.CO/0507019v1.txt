For positive integers r,k_0,k_1,...,k_{r-1}, the van der Waerden number w(k_0,k_1,...,k_{r-1}) is the least positive integer n such that whenever \{1,2,...,n\} is partitioned into r sets S_{0},S_{1},...,S_{r-1}, there is some i so that S_i contains a k_i-term arithmetic progression. We find several new exact values of w(k_0,k_1,...,k_{r-1}). In addition, for the situation in which only one value of k_i differs from 2, we give a precise formula for the van der Waerden function (provided this one value of k_i is not too small)
