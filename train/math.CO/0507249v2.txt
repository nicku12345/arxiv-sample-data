We describe a framework for systematic enumeration of families combinatorial structures which possess a certain regularity. More precisely, we describe how to obtain the differential equations satisfied by their generating series. These differential equations are then used to determine the initial counting sequence and for asymptotic analysis. The key tool is the scalar product for symmetric functions and that this operation preserves D-finiteness.
