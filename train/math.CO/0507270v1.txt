In the early 1980s, Mills, Robbins and Rumsey conjectured, and in 1996 Zeilberger proved a simple product formula for the number of n \times n alternating sign matrices with a 1 at the top of the i-th column. We give an alternative proof of this formula using our operator formula for the number of monotone triangles with prescribed bottom row. In addition, we provide the enumeration of certain 0-1-(-1) matrices generalizing alternating sign matrices.
