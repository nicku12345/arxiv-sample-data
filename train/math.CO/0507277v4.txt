This note which can be viewed as a complement to Alex Postnikov's paper math.CO/0507163, presents a self-contained overview of basic properties of nested complexes and their two dual polyhedral realizations: as complete simplicial fans, and as simple polytopes. Most of the results are not new; our aim is to bring into focus a striking similarity between nested complexes and associated fans and polytopes on one side, and cluster complexes and generalized associahedra introduced and studied in hep-th/0111053, math.CO/0202004, on the other side.
