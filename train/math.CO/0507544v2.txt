In this paper we give a combinatorial interpretation for the coefficient of s_{\nu} in the Kronecker product s_{(n-p,p)}\ast s_{\lambda}, where \lambda=(\lambda_1, ..., \lambda_{\ell(\lambda)})\vdash n, if \ell(\lambda)\geq 2p-1 or \lambda_1\geq 2p-1; that is, if \lambda is not a partition inside the 2(p-1)\times 2(p-1) square. For \lambda inside the square our combinatorial interpretation provides an upper bound for the coefficients. In general, we are able to combinatorially compute these coefficients for all \lambda when n>(2p-2)^2. We use this combinatorial interpretation to give characterizations for multiplicity free Kronecker products. We have also obtained some formulas for special cases.
