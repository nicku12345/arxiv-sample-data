We consider the following generalization of the decomposition theorem for polycycles. A {\em (R,q)-polycycle} is, roughly, a plane graph, whose faces, besides some disjoint {\em holes}, are i-gons, i \in R, and whose vertices, outside of holes, are q-valent. Such polycycle is called {\em elliptic}, {\em parabolic} or {\em hyperbolic} if \frac{1}{q} + \frac{1}{r} - {1/2} (where r={max_{i \in R}i}) is positive, zero or negative, respectively.   An edge on the boundary of a hole in such polycycle is called {\em open} if both its end-vertices have degree less than q. We enumerate all elliptic {\em elementary} polycycles, i.e. those that any elliptic (R,q)-polycycle can be obtained from them by agglomeration along some open edges.
