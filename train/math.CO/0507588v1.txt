Let 1 \leq a \leq b be integers. A triple of the form (x,ax+d,bx+2d), where x,d are positive integers is called an {\em (a,b)-triple}. The {\em degree of regularity} of the family of all (a,b)-triples, denoted dor(a,b), is the maximum integer r such that every r-coloring of \mathbb{N} admits a monochromatic (a,b)-triple. We settle, in the affirmative, the conjecture that dor(a,b) < \infty for all (a,b) \neq (1,1). We also disprove the conjecture that dor(a,b) \in \{1,2,\infty\} for all (a,b).
