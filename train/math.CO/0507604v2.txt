Given any linear code C over a finite field GF(q) we show how C can be described in a transparent and geometrical way by using the associated Bruen-Silverman code. Then, specializing to the case of MDS codes we use our new approach to offer improvements to the main results currently available concerning MDS extensions of linear MDS codes. We also sharply limit the possibilities for constructing long non-linear MDS codes.
