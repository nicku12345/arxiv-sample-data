In this paper, we study Grothendieck polynomials from a combinatorial viewpoint. We introduce the factorial Grothendieck polynomials, analogues of the factorial Schur functions and present some of their properties, and use them to produce a generalisation of a Littlewood-Richardson rule for Grothendieck polynomials.
