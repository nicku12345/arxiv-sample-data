We study restricted homomorphism dualities in the context of classes with bounded expansion. This presents a generalization of restricted dualities obtained earlier for bounded degree graphs and also for proper minor closed classes. This is related to distance coloring of graphs and to the ''approximative version'' of Hadwiger conjecture.
