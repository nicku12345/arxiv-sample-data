Let SYT_n be the set of all standard Young tableaux with n cells. After recalling the definitions of four partial orders, the weak, KL, geometric and chain orders on SYT_n and some of their crucial properties, we prove three main results: (i)Intervals in any of these four orders essentially describe the product in a Hopf algebra of tableaux defined by Poirier and Reutenauer. (ii) The map sending a tableau to its descent set induces a homotopy equivalence of the proper parts of all of these orders on tableaux with that of the Boolean algebra 2^{[n-1]}. In particular, the M\"obius function of these orders on tableaux is (-1)^{n-3}. (iii) For two of the four orders, one can define a more general order on skew tableaux having fixed inner boundary, and similarly analyze their homotopy type and M\"obius function.
