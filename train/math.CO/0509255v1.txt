We give a combinatorial interpretation of a matrix identity on Catalan numbers and the sequence (1, 4, 4^2, 4^3, ...) which has been derived by Shapiro, Woan and Getu by using Riordan arrays. By giving a bijection between weighted partial Motzkin paths with an elevation line and weighted free Motzkin paths, we find a matrix identity on the number of weighted Motzkin paths and the sequence (1, k, k^2, k^3, ...) for any k \geq 2. By extending this argument to partial Motzkin paths with multiple elevation lines, we give a combinatorial proof of an identity recently obtained by Cameron and Nkwanta. A matrix identity on colored Dyck paths is also given, leading to a matrix identity for the sequence (1, t^2+t, (t^2+t)^2, ...).
