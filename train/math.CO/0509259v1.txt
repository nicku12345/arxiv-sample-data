The {\it Sierpi\'nski fractal} or {\it Sierpi\'nski gasket} \Sigma is a familiar object studied by specialists in dynamical systems and probability. In this paper, we consider a graph S_n derived from the first n iterations of the process that leads to \Sigma, and study some of its properties, including its cycle structure, domination number and pebbling number. Various open questions are posed.
