A Latin square L(n,k) is a square of order n with its entries colored with k colors so that all the entries in a row or column have different colors. Let d(L(n,k)) be the minimal number of colored entries of an n \times n square such that there is a unique way of coloring of the yet uncolored entries in order to obtain a Latin square L(n, k). In this paper we discuss the properties of d(L(n,k)) for k=2n-1 and k=2n-2. We give an alternate proof of the identity d(L(n, 2n-1))=n^2-n, which holds for even n, and we establish the new result d(L(n, 2n-2)) \geq n^2-\lfloor\frac{8n}{5}\rfloor and show that this bound is tight for n divisible by 10.
