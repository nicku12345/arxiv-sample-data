A permutation is so-called two stack sortable if it (i) avoids the (scattered) pattern 2-3-4-1, and (ii) contains a 3-2-4-1 pattern only as part of a 3-5-2-4-1 pattern. Here we show that the permutations on [n] satisfying condition (ii) alone are equinumerous with the permutations on [n] that avoid the mixed scattered/consecutive pattern 31-4-2. The proof uses a known bijection from 3-2-1-avoiding to 3-1-2-avoiding permutations.
