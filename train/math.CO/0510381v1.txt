A graph X is said to be {\it distance--balanced} if for any edge uv of X, the number of vertices closer to u than to v is equal to the number of vertices closer to v than to u. A graph X is said to be {\it strongly distance--balanced} if for any edge uv of X and any integer k, the number of vertices at distance k from u and at distance k+1 from v is equal to the number of vertices at distance k+1 from u and at distance k from v. Obviously, being distance--balanced is metrically a weaker condition than being strongly distance--balanced. In this paper, a connection between symmetry properties of graphs and the metric property of being (strongly) distance--balanced is explored. In particular, it is proved that every vertex--transitive graph is strongly distance--balanced.   A graph is said to be {\em semisymmetric} if its automorphism group acts transitively on its edge set, but does not act transitively on its vertex set. An infinite family of semisymmetric graphs, which are not distance--balanced, is constructed.   Finally, we give a complete classification of strongly distance--balanced graphs for the following infinite families of generalized Petersen graphs: \GP(n,2), \GP(5k+1,k), \GP(3k\pm 3,k), and \GP(2k+2,k).
