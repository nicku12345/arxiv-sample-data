Let \p_N \colon \tX \to X be a regular covering projection of connected graphs with the group of covering transformations isomorphic to N. If N is an elementary abelian p-group, then the projection \p_N is called p-elementary abelian. The projection \p_N is vertex-transitive (edge-transitive) if some vertex-transitive (edge-transitive) subgroup of \Aut X lifts along \p_N, and semisymmetric if it is edge- but not vertex-transitive. The projection \p_N is minimal semisymmetric if p_N cannot be written as a composition \p_N = \p \circ \p_M of two (nontrivial) regular covering projections, where \p_M is semisymmetric.   Finding elementary abelian covering projections can be grasped combinatorially via a linear representation of automorphisms acting on the first homology group of the graph. The method essentially reduces to finding invariant subspaces of matrix groups over prime fields (see {\em J. Algebr. Combin.}, {\bf 20} (2004), 71--97).   In this paper, all pairwise nonisomorphic minimal semisymmetric elementary abelian regular covering projections of the M\"{o}bius-Kantor graph, the Generalized Petersen graph \GP(8,3), are constructed. No such covers exist for p =2. Otherwise, the number of such covering projections is equal to (p-1)/4 and 1+ (p-1)/4 in cases p \equiv 5,9,13,17,21 (\mod 24) and p \equiv 1 (\mod 24), respectively, and to (p+1)/4 and 1+ (p+1)/4 in cases p \equiv 3,7,11,15,23 (\mod 24) and p \equiv 19 (\mod 24), respectively. For each such covering projection the voltage rules generating the corresponding covers are displayed explicitly.
