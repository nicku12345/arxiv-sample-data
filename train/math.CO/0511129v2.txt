An amorphic association scheme has the property that any of its fusion is also an association scheme. In this paper we generalize the property to be amorphic to an arbitrary C-algebra and prove that any amorphic C-algebra is determined up to isomorphism by the multiset of its degrees and an additional integer equal 1 or -1. Moreover, we show that any amorphic C-algebra with rational structure constants is the fusion of an amorphic homogeneous C-algebra. Finally, as a special case of our results we obtain the well-known Ivanov's characterization of intersection numbers of amorphic association schemes.
