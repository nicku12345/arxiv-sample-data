We determine the exact and asymptotic number of unlabeled outerplanar graphs. The exact number g_n of unlabeled outerplanar graphs on n vertices can be computed in polynomial time, and g_n is asymptotically g n^{-5/2}\rho^{-n}, where g\approx0.00909941 and \rho^{-1}\approx7.50360 can be approximated. Using our enumerative results we investigate several statistical properties of random unlabeled outerplanar graphs on n vertices, for instance concerning connectedness, chromatic number, and the number of edges. To obtain the results we combine classical cycle index enumeration with recent results from analytic combinatorics.
