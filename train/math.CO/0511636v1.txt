Denote by A_n the set of square (0,1) matrices of order n. The set A_n, n\le8, is partitioned into row/column permutation equivalence classes enabling derivation of various facts by simple counting. For example, the number of regular (0,1) matrices of order 8 is 10160459763342013440. Let D_n, S_n denote the set of absolute determinant values and Smith normal forms of matrices from A_n. Denote by a_n the smallest integer not in D_n. The sets \mathcal{D}_9 and \mathcal{S}_9 are obtained; especially, a_9=103. The lower bounds for a_n, 10\le n\le 19, (exceeding the known lower bound a_n\ge 2f_{n-1}, where f_n is nth Fibonacci number) are obtained. Row/permutation equivalence classes of A_n correspond to bipartite graphs with n black and n white vertices, and so the other applications of the classification are possible.
