A Diophantine figure is a set of points on the integer grid \mathbb{Z}^{2} where all mutual Euclidean distances are integers. We also speak of Diophantine graphs. In this language a Diophantine figure is a complete Diophantine graph. Due to a famous theorem of Erd\H{o}s and Anning there are complete Diophantine graphs which are not contained in larger ones. We call them Erd\H{o}s-Diophantine graphs. A special class of Diophantine graphs are Diophantine carpets. These are planar triangulations of a subset of the integer grid.   We give an effective construction for Erd\H{o}s-Diophantine graphs and characterize the chromatic number of Diophantine carpets.
