We consider unimodality and related properties of f-vectors of polytopes in various dimensions. By a result of Kalai (1988), f-vectors of 5-polytopes are unimodal. In higher dimensions much less can be said; we give an overview on current results and present a potentially interesting construction as well as a conjecture arising from this.
