The classical Erd\H os-Ko-Rado theorem states that if k\le\floor{n/2} then the largest family of pairwise intersecting k-subsets of [n]=\{0,1,...,n\} is of size {{n-1}\choose{k-1}}. A family of k subsets satisfying this pairwise intersecting property is called an EKR family. We generalize the EKR property and provide asymptotic lower bounds on the size of the largest family {\cal A} of k-subsets of [n] that satisfies the following property: For each A,B,C\in{\cal A}, each of the four sets A\cap B\cap C;A\cap B\cap C^C; A\cap B^C\cap C; A^C\cap B\cap C are non-empty. This generalized EKR (GEKR) property is motivated, generalizations are suggested, and a comparison is made with fixed weight 3-covering arrays. Our techniques are probabilistic.
