Let A_q be a q-letter alphabet and w be a right infinite word on this alphabet. A subword of w is a block of consecutive letters of w. The subword complexity function of w assigns to each positive integer n the number f_w(n) of distinct subwords of length n of w.   The gap function of an infinite word over the binary alphabet \{0,1 \} gives the distances between consecutive 1's in this word. In this paper we study infinite binary words whose gap function is injective or "almost injective". A method for computing the subword complexity of such words is given. A necessary and sufficient condition for a function to be the subword complexity function of a binary word whose gap function is strictly increasing is obtained.
