Let V be a set of cardinality v (possibly infinite). Two graphs G and G' with vertex set V are {\it isomorphic up to complementation} if G' is isomorphic to G or to the complement \bar G of G. Let k be a non-negative integer, G and G' are {\it k-hypomorphic up to complementation} if for every k-element subset K of V, the induced subgraphs G\_{\restriction K} and G'\_{\restriction K} are isomorphic up to complementation. A graph G is {\it k-reconstructible up to complementation} if every graph G' which is k-hypomorphic to G up to complementation is in fact isomorphic to G up to complementation. We give a partial characterisation of the set \mathcal S of pairs (n,k) such that two graphs G and G' on the same set of n vertices are equal up to complementation whenever they are k-hypomorphic up to complementation. We prove in particular that \mathcal S contains all pairs (n,k) such that 4\leq k\leq n-4. We also prove that 4 is the least integer k such that every graph G having a large number n of vertices is k-reconstructible up to complementation; this answers a question raised by P. Ille
