It was proved few years ago that classes of Boolean functions definable by means of functional equations \cite{EFHH}, or equivalently, by means of relational constraints \cite{Pi2}, coincide with initial segments of the quasi-ordered set (\Omega, \leq) made of the set \Omega of Boolean functions, suitably quasi-ordered. The resulting ordered set (\Omega/\equiv, \sqsubseteq) embeds into ([\omega]^{<\omega}, \subseteq), the set -ordered by inclusion- of finite subsets of the set \omega of integers. We prove that (\Omega/\equiv, \sqsubseteq) also embeds ([\omega]^{<\omega}, \subseteq). We prove that initial segments of (\Omega, \leq) which are definable by finitely many obstructions coincide with classes defined by finitely many equations. This gives, in particular, that the classes of Boolean functions with a bounded number of essential variables are finitely definable. As an example, we provide a concrete characterization of the subclasses made of linear functions.
