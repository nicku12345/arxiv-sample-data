We present the implementation of an algorithm for graph isomorphism testing, based on ideas about number of walks (of sufficiently large length) between vertices. The algorithm is expanded for strongly regular graphs (SRG-s) by testing the local complements and values of determinants of their adjacency matrices. All known non-isomorphic SRG-s (with no more than 64 vertices) are distinguishable by this method.
