A case-free proof is given that the entries of the h-vector of the cluster complex \Delta (\Phi), associated by S. Fomin and A. Zelevinsky to a finite root system \Phi, count elements of the lattice \nc of noncrossing partitions of corresponding type by rank. Similar interpretations for the h-vector of the positive part of \Delta (\Phi) are provided. The proof utilizes the appearance of the complex \Delta (\Phi) in the context of the lattice \nc, in recent work of two of the authors, as well as an explicit shelling of \Delta (\Phi).
