We give another proof for the (-1)-enumeration of self-complementary plane partitions with at least one odd side-length by specializing a certain Schur function identity. The proof is analogous to Stanley's proof for the ordinary enumeration. In addition, we obtain enumerations of 180-degree symmetric rhombus tilings of hexagons with a barrier of arbitrary length along the central line.
