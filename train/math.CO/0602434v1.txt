Let \Gamma be a simple graph of size m and degree sequence \delta_1\ge \delta_2\ge ... \ge \delta_n. Let {\cal L}(\Gamma) denotes the line graph of \Gamma. The aim of this paper is to study mathematical properties of the alliance number, {a}({\cal L}(\Gamma), and the global alliance number, \gamma_{a}({\cal L}(\Gamma)), of the line graph of a simple graph. We show that \lceil\frac{\delta_{n}+\delta_{n-1}-1}{2}\rceil \le {a}({\cal L}(\Gamma))\le \delta_1. In particular, if \Gamma is a \delta-regular graph (\delta>0), then a({\cal L}(\Gamma))=\delta, and if \Gamma is a (\delta_1,\delta_2)-semiregular bipartite graph, then a({\cal L}(\Gamma))=\lceil \frac{\delta_1+\delta_2-1}{2} \rceil. As a consequence of the study we compare a({\cal L}(\Gamma)) and {a}(\Gamma), and we characterize the graphs having a({\cal L}(\Gamma))<4. Moreover, we show that the global-connected alliance number of {\cal L}(\Gamma) is bounded by \gamma_{ca}({\cal L}(\Gamma)) \ge \lceil\sqrt{D(\Gamma)+m-1}-1\rceil, where D(\Gamma) denotes the diameter of \Gamma, and we show that the global alliance number of {\cal L}(\Gamma) is bounded by \gamma_{a}({\cal L}(\Gamma))\geq \lceil\frac{2m}{\delta_{1}+\delta_{2}+1}\rceil. The case of strong alliances is studied by analogy.
