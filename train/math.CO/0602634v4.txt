New sufficient conditions and necessary conditions are developed for two skew diagrams to give rise to the same skew Schur function. The sufficient conditions come from a variety of new operations related to ribbons (also known as border strips or rim hooks). The necessary conditions relate to the extent of overlap among the rows or among the columns of the skew diagram.
