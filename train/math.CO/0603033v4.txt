We derive a Jacobi-Trudi type formula for Jack functions of rectangular shapes. In this formula, we make use of a hyperdeterminant, which is Cayley's simple generalization of the determinant. In addition, after developing the general theory of hyperdeterminants, we give summation formulae for Schur functions involving hyperdeterminants, and evaluate Toeplitz-type hyperdeterminants by using Jack function theory.
