Two general methods for establishing the logarithmic behavior of recursively defined sequences of real numbers are presented. One is the interlacing method, and the other one is based on calculus. Both methods are used to prove logarithmic behavior of some combinatorially relevant sequences, such as Motzkin and Schr\"oder numbers, sequences of values of some classic orthogonal polynomials, and many others. The calculus method extends also to two- (or more-) indexed sequences.
