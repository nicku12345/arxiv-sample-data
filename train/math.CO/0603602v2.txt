A sequence S is potentially K_{m}-H-graphical if it has a realization containing a K_{m}-H as a subgraph. Let \sigma(K_{m}-H, n) denote the smallest degree sum such that every n-term graphical sequence S with \sigma(S)\geq \sigma(K_{m}-H, n) is potentially K_{m}-H-graphical. In this paper, we determine \sigma (K_{r+1}-(kP_2\bigcup tK_2), n) for n\geq 4r+10, r+1 \geq 3k+2t, k+t \geq 2,k \geq 1, t \geq 0 .
