Given a permutation \pi\in \Sn\_n, construct a graph G\_\pi on the vertex set \{1,2, ..., n\} by joining i to j if (i) i<j and \pi(i)<\pi(j) and (ii) there is no k such that i < k < j and \pi(i)<\pi(k)<\pi(j). We say that \pi is forest-like if G\_\pi is a forest. We first characterize forest-like permutations in terms of pattern avoidance, and then by a certain linear map being onto. Thanks to recent results of Woo and Yong, this shows that forest-like permutations characterize Schubert varieties which are locally factorial. Thus forest-like permutations generalize smooth permutations (corresponding to smooth Schubert varieties). We compute the generating function of forest-like permutations. As in the smooth case, it turns out to be algebraic. We then adapt our method to count permutations for which G\_\pi is a tree, or a path, and recover the known generating function of smooth permutations.
