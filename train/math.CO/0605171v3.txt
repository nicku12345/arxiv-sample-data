A family of k-subsets A_1, A_2, ..., A_d on [n]=\{1,2,..., n\} is called a (d, c)-cluster if the union A_1\cup A_2 \cup ... \cup A_d contains at most ck elements with c<d. Let \mathcal{F} be a family of k-subsets of an n-element set. We show that for k \geq 2 and n \geq k+2, if every (k, 2)-cluster of \mathcal{F} is intersecting, then \mathcal{F} contains no (k-1)-dimensional simplices. This leads to an affirmative answer to Mubayi's conjecture for d=k based on Chv\'atal's simplex theorem. We also show that for any d satisfying 3 \leq d \leq k and n \geq \frac{dk}{d-1}, if every (d, {d+1\over 2})-cluster is intersecting, then |\mathcal{F}|\leq {{n-1} \choose {k-1}} with equality only when  \mathcal{F} is a complete star. This result is an extension of both Frankl's theorem and Mubayi's theorem.
