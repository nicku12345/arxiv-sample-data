Let f_i(P) denote the number of i-dimensional faces of a convex polytope P. Furthermore, let S(n,d) and C(n,d) denote, respectively, the stacked and the cyclic d-dimensional polytopes on n vertices. Our main result is that for every simplicial d-polytope P, if  f_r(S(n_1,d))\le f_r(P) \le f_r(C(n_2,d))  for some integers n_1, n_2 and r, then  f_s(S(n_1,d))\le f_s(P) \le f_s(C(n_2,d))  for all s such that r<s.   For r=0 these inequalities are the well-known lower and upper bound theorems for simplicial polytopes.   The result is implied by a certain ``comparison theorem'' for f-vectors, formulated in Section 4. Among its other consequences is a similar lower bound theorem for centrally-symmetric simplicial polytopes.
