Let \Phi be an irreducible crystallographic root system with Weyl group W and coroot lattice \check{Q}, spanning a Euclidean space V. Let m be a positive integer and \aA^m_\Phi be the arrangement of hyperplanes in V of the form (\alpha, x) = k for \alpha \in \Phi and k = 0, 1,...,m. It is known that the number N^+ (\Phi, m) of bounded dominant regions of \aA^m_\Phi is equal to the number of facets of the positive part \Delta^m_+ (\Phi) of the generalized cluster complex associated to the pair (\Phi, m) by S. Fomin and N. Reading.   We define a statistic on the set of bounded dominant regions of \aA^m_\Phi and conjecture that the corresponding refinement of N^+ (\Phi, m) coincides with the h-vector of \Delta^m_+ (\Phi). We compute these refined numbers for the classical root systems as well as for all root systems when m=1 and verify the conjecture when \Phi has type A, B or C and when m=1. We give several combinatorial interpretations to these numbers in terms of chains of order ideals in the root poset of \Phi, orbits of the action of W on the quotient \check{Q} / (mh-1) \check{Q} and coroot lattice points inside a certain simplex, analogous to the ones given by the first author in the case of the set of all dominant regions of \aA^m_\Phi. We also provide a dual interpretation in terms of order filters in the root poset of \Phi in the special case m=1.
