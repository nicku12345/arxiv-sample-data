Let \Phi be an finite root system with corresponding reflection group W and let m be a nonnegative integer. We consider the generalized cluster complex \Delta^m(\Phi) defined by S. Fomin and N. Reading and the poset NC_{(m)}(W) of m-divisible noncrossing partitions defined by D. Armstrong. We give a characterization of the faces of \Delta^m(\Phi) in terms of NC_{(m)}(W), generalizing that of T. Brady and C. Watt given in the case m=1. Making use of this, we give a case free proof of a conjecture of F. Chapoton and D. Armstrong, which relates a certain refined face count of \Delta^m(\Phi) with the M\"obius function of NC_{(m)}(W).
