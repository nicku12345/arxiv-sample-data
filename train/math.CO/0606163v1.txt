We enumerate weighted graphs with a certain upper bound condition. We also compute the generating function of the numbers of these graphs, and prove that it is a rational function. In particular, we show that if the given graph is a bipartite graph, then its generating function is of the form \frac{p(x)}{(1-x)^{m+1}}, where m is the number of vertices of the graph and p(x) is a polynomial of degree at most m.
