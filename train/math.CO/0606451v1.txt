We show that for any two linear homogenous equations \mathcal{E}_0,\mathcal{E}_1, each with at least three variables and coefficients not all the same sign, any 2-coloring of \mathbb{Z}^+ admits monochromatic solutions of color 0 to \mathcal{E}_0 or monochromatic solutions of color 1 to \mathcal{E}_1. We define the 2-color off-diagonal Rado number RR(\mathcal{E}_0,\mathcal{E}_1) to be the smallest N such that [1,N] must admit such solutions. We determine a lower bound for RR(\mathcal{E}_0,\mathcal{E}_1) in certain cases when each \mathcal{E}_i is of the form a_1x_1+...+a_nx_n=z as well as find the exact value of RR(\mathcal{E}_0,\mathcal{E}_1) when each is of the form x_1+a_2x_2+...+a_nx_n=z. We then present a Maple package that determines upper bounds for off-diagonal Rado numbers of a few particular types, and use it to quickly prove two previous results for diagonal Rado numbers.
