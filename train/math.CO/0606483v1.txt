A divisor graph G is an ordered pair (V, E) where V \subset \mathbbm{Z} and for all u \neq v \in V, u v \in E if and only if u \mid v or v \mid u. A graph which is isomorphic to a divisor graph is also called a divisor graph. In this note, we will prove that for any n \geqslant 1 and 0 \leqslant m \leqslant \binom{n}{2} then there exists a divisor graph of order n and size m. We also present a simple proof of the characterization of divisor graphs which is due to Chartran, Muntean, Saenpholpant and Zhang.
