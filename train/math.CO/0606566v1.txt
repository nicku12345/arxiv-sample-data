The flag-major index "fmaj" and the classical length function "\ell" are used to construct two q-analogs of the generating polynomial for the hyperoctahedral group~B_n by number of positive and negative fixed points (resp. pixed points). Specializations of those q-analogs are also derived dealing with signed derangements and desarrangements, as well as several classical results that were previously proved for the symmetric group.
