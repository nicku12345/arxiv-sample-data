To each permutation \sigma in S_{n} we associate a triangulation of a fixed (n+2)-gon. We then determine the fibers of this association and show that they coincide with the sylvester classes depicted By Novelli, Hivert and Thibon. A signed version of this construction allows us to reformulate the four color theorem in terms of the existence of a signable path between any two permutations in the Cayley graph of the symmetric group S_{n}.
