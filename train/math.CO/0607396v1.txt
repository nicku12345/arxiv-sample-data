In a d-simplex every facet is a (d-1)-simplex. We consider as generalized simplices other combinatorial classes of polytopes, all of whose facets are in the class. Cubes and multiplexes are two such classes of generalized simplices. In this paper we study a new class, braxtopes, which arise as the faces of periodically-cyclic Gale polytopes. We give a geometric construction for these polytopes and various combinatorial properties.
