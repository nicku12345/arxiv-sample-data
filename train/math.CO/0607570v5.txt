Oriented matroids can serve as a tool of modeling of collective decision-making processes in contradictory problems of pattern recognition. We present a generalization of the committee techniques of pattern recognition to oriented matroids. A tope committee for an oriented matroid is a subset of its maximal covectors such that every positive halfspace contains more than half of the maximal covectors from this subset. For a large subfamily of oriented matroids their committee structure is quite rich; for example, any maximal chains in their tope posets provide one with information sufficient to construct a committee.
