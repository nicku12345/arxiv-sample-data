A k-digraph is an orientation of a multi-graph that is without loops and contains at most k edges between any pair of distinct vertices. We obtain necessary and sufficient conditions for a sequence of non-negative integers in non-decreasing order to be a sequence of numbers, called marks (k-scores), attached to vertices of a k-digraph. We characterize irreducible mark sequences in k-digraphs and uniquely realizable mark sequences in 2-digraphs.
