In 2003, Maroti showed that one could use the machinery of l-cores and l-quotients of partitions to establish lower bounds for p(n), the number of partitions of n. In this paper we explore these ideas in the case l=2, using them to give a largely combinatorial proof of an effective upper bound on p(n), and to prove asymptotic formulae for the number of self-conjugate partitions, and the number of partitions with distinct parts. In a further application we give a combinatorial proof of an identity originally due to Gauss.
