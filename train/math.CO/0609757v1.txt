An (L,d)^*-coloring is a mapping \phi that assigns a color \phi(v)\in L(v) to each vertex v\in V(G) such that at most d neighbors of v receive colore \phi(v). A graph is called (m,d)^*-choosable, if G admits an (L,d)^*-coloring for every list assignment L with |L(v)|\geq m for all v\in V(G). In this note, it is proved that every toroidal graph, which contains no adjacent triangles and contains no 6-cycles and l-cycles for some l \in \{5,7\}, is (3,1)^*-choosable.
