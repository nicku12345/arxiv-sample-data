If we are given a connected finite graph G and a subset of its vertices V_{0}, we define a distance-residual graph as a graph induced on the set of vertices that have the maximal distance from V_{0}. Some properties and examples of distance-residual graphs of vertex-transitive, edge-transitive, bipartite and semisymmetric graphs are shown. The relations between the distance-residual graphs of product graphs and their factors are shown.
