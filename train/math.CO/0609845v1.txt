Let S be a finite set of positive integers with largest element m. Let us randomly select a composition a of the integer n with parts in S, and let m(a) be the multiplicity of m as a part of a. Let 0\leq r<q be integers, with q\geq 2, and let p_{n,r} be the probability that m(a) is congruent to r modulo q. We show that if S satisfies a certain simple condition, then \lim_{n\to \infty} p_{n,r} =1/q. In fact, we show that an obvious necessary condition on S turns out to be sufficient.
