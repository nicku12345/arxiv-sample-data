We present a fast enumeration algorithm for combinatorial 2- and 3-manifolds. In particular, we enumerate all triangulated surfaces with 11 and 12 vertices and all triangulated 3-manifolds with 11 vertices. We further determine all equivelar polyhedral maps on the non-orientable surface of genus 4 as well as all equivelar triangulations of the orientable surface of genus 3 and the non-orientable surfaces of genus 5 and 6.
