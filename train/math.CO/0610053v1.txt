Media theory is a new branch of discrete applied mathematics originally developed in mid-nineties to deal with stochastic evolution of preference relations in political science and mathematical psychology. The theory focuses on a particular semigroup of `messages' acting as transformations of a set of `states', called a `medium', whose axioms are both strong and natural. The term `medium' stems from a particular application in which the transformations formalize the effects, on an individual, of `tokens' of information delivered by the environment--that is, the `medium'. However, many different types of examples can be found, ranging from learning spaces to hypercube computers, suggesting that this concept is ubiquitous. The paper presents very basic concepts and results of media theory and is aimed at a wide body of researchers in discrete applied mathematics.
