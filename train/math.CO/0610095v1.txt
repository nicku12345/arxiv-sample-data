Garsia-Haiman modules are quotient rings in variables X_n={x_1, x_2, ..., x_n} and Y_n=y_1, y_2, ..., y_n} that generalize the quotient ring C[X_n]/I, where I is the ideal generated by the elementary symmetric polynomials e_j(X_n) for 1 <= j <= n. A bitableaux basis for the Garsia-Haiman modules of hollow type is constructed. Applications of this basis to representation theory and other related polynomial spaces are considered.
