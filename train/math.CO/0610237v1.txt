We say that a permutation \pi is a Motzkin permutation if it avoids 132 and there do not exist a<b such that \pi_a<\pi_b<\pi_{b+1}. We study the distribution of several statistics in Motzkin permutations, including the length of the longest increasing and decreasing subsequences and the number of rises and descents. We also enumerate Motzkin permutations with additional restrictions, and study the distribution of occurrences of fairly general patterns in this class of permutations.
