Stanley's non-negativity theorem is at the heart of many of the results in Ehrhart theory. In this paper, we analyze the root behavior of general polynomials satisfying the conditions of Stanley's theorem and compare this to the known root behavior of Ehrhart polynomials. We provide a possible counterexample to a conjecture of the second author, M. Beck, J. De Loera, J. Pfeifle, and R. Stanley, and contribute some experimental data as well.
