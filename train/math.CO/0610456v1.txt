A triangle-free graph G is called read-k when there exists a monotone Boolean formula \phi whose variables are the vertices of G and whose minterms are precisely the edges of G, such that no variable occurs more than k times in \phi. The smallest such k is called the readability of G. We exhibit a very simple class of bipartite chain graphs on 2n vertices with readability \Omega(\sqrt{\frac{\log n}{\log \log n}}).
