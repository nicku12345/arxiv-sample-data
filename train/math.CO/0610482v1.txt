Given a nonnegative integer m and a finite collection {\mathcal A} of linear forms on {\mathbb Q}^d, the arrangement of affine hyperplanes in {\mathbb Q}^d defined by the equations \alpha(x) = k for \alpha \in {\mathcal A} and integers k \in [-m, m] is denoted by {\mathcal A}^m. It is proved that the coefficients of the characteristic polynomial of {\mathcal A}^m are quasi-polynomials in m and that they satisfy a simple combinatorial reciprocity law.
