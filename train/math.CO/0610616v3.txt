We study joint distributions of cycles and patterns in permutations written in standard cycle form. We explore both classical and generalised patterns of length 2 and 3. Many extensions of classical theory are achieved; bivariate generating functions for inversions, ascents, descents, 123s, valleys, 1'-2-1s; closed forms forms for avoidance of peaks, 2-3-1s, 1-2-3s, 2'-1-2s and 1'-2-1s; bijective proofs of Wilf-equivalences.   We also derive some results about standard pattern occurrence, such as continued fractions for the generating functions for occurrences of valleys and the pattern 123.   The methods are simple and combinatorial in nature: direct enumerative analysis and bijections to lattice paths.
