A tope committee K* for a simple oriented matroid M is a subset of its maximal covectors such that every positive halfspace of M contains more than half of the covectors from K*. The structures of the family of all committees for M, and of the family of its committees that contain no pairs of opposites, are described. A Farey subsequence associated with the elements of the m-th layer of the Boolean lattice of rank 2m is explored.
