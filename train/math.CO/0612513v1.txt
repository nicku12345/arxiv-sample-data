We show that, if the representation group R of a slim dense near hexagon S is non-abelian, then R is of exponent 4 and |R|=2^{\beta}, 1+NPdim(S)\leq \beta\leq 1+dimV(S), where NPdim(S) is the near polygon embedding dimension of S and dimV(S) is the dimension of the universal representation module V(S) of S. Further, if \beta =1+NPdim(S), then R is an extraspecial 2-group (Theorem 1.6).
