The notion of cyclic sieving phenomenon is introduced by Reiner, Stanton, and White as a generalization of Stembridge's q=-1 phenomenon. The generalized cluster complexes associated to root systems are given by Fomin and Reading as a generalization of the cluster complexes found by Fomin and Zelevinsky. In this paper, the faces of various dimensions of the generalized cluster complexes in type A_n, B_n, D_n, and I_2(a) are shown to exhibit the cyclic sieving phenomenon under a cyclic group action. For the cluster complexes of exceptional type E_6, E_7, E_8, F_4, H_3, and H_4, a verification for such a phenomenon on their maximal faces is given.
