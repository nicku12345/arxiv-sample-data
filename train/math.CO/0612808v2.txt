Isonemal weaving designs, introduced into mathematical literature by Gr\"unbaum and Shephard, were classified into thirty-nine infinite sets and a small number of exceptions by Richard Roth. This paper refines Roth's taxonomy for the first ten of these families in order to solve three problems, which designs exist in various sizes, which prefabrics can be doubled and remain isonemal, and which can be halved and remain isonemal.
