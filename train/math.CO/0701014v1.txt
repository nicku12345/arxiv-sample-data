A critical set in an n \times n array is a set C of given entries, such that there exists a unique extension of C to an n\times n Latin square and no proper subset of C has this property. The cardinality of the largest critical set in any Latin square of order n is denoted by \lcs{n}. We give a lower bound for \lcs{n} by showing that \lcs{n} \geq n^2(1-\frac{2 + \ln 2}{\ln n})+n(1+\frac {\ln (8 \pi)} {\ln n})-\frac{\ln 2}{\ln n}.
