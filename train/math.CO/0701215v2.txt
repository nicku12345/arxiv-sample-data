We study "cominuscule tableau combinatorics" by generalizing constructions of M. Haiman, S. Fomin and M.-P. Sch\"utzenberger. In particular, we extend the dual equivalence ideas of [Haiman, 1992] to reformulate the generalized Littlewood-Richardson rule for cominuscule G/P Schubert calculus from [Thomas-Yong, 2006]. We apply dual equivalence to give an alternative and independent proof of the jeu de taquin results of [Proctor, 2004] needed in our earlier work. We also extend Fomin's growth diagram description of jeu de taquin; the inherent symmetry of these diagrams leads to a generalization of Sch\"utzenberger's evacuation involution. Finally, these results are applied to give an cominuscule extension of the carton rule of [Thomas-Yong, 2008].
