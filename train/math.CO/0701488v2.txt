A Universal Cycle for t-multisets of [n]={1,...,n} is a cyclic sequence of \binom{n+t-1}{t} integers from [n] with the property that each t-multiset of [n] appears exactly once consecutively in the sequence. For such a sequence to exist it is necessary that n divides \binom{n+t-1}{t}, and it is reasonable to conjecture that this condition is sufficient for large enough n in terms of t. We prove the conjecture completely for t in {2,3} and partially for t in {4,6}. These results also support a positive answer to a question of Knuth.
