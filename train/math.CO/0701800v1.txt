We present two classes of random walks restricted to the quarter plane whose generating function is not holonomic. The non-holonomy is established using the iterated kernel method, a recent variant of the kernel method. This adds evidence to a recent conjecture on combinatorial properties of walks with holonomic generating functions. The method also yields an asymptotic expression for the number of walks of length n.
