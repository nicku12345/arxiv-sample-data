We introduce weighted succession rules and parametric production matrices - simple extensions of the standard ECO method succession rules and production matrices. The purpose is to enumerate combinatorial objects with respect to several variables. We consider one main example, from the theory of Dyck paths. The path statistics primarily considered are peak height, rise height, and certain subwalks. Many classical sequences (such as the Catalan, Motzkin, Narayana and Schroeder numbers) are incorporated in this example.
