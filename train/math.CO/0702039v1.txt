We construct a deterministic approximation algorithm for computing a permanent of a 0,1 n by n matrix to within a multiplicative factor (1+\epsilon)^n, for arbitrary \epsilon>0. When the graph underlying the matrix is a constant degree expander our algorithm runs in polynomial time (PTAS). In the general case the running time of the algorithm is \exp(O(n^{2\over 3}\log^3n)). For the class of graphs which are constant degree expanders the first result is an improvement over the best known approximation factor e^n obtained in \cite{LinialSamorodnitskyWigderson}.   Our results use a recently developed deterministic approximation algorithm for counting partial matchings of a graph Bayati et al., and Jerrum-Vazirani decomposition method.
