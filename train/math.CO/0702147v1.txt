Let G be a digraph (without parallel edges) such that every directed cycle has length at least four; let \beta(G) denote the size of the smallest subset X in E(G) such that G\X has no directed cycles, and let \gamma(G) be the number of unordered pairs {u,v} of vertices such that u,v are nonadjacent in G. It is easy to see that if \gamma(G) = 0 then \beta(G) = 0; what can we say about \beta(G) if \gamma(G) is bounded?   We prove that in general \beta(G) is at most \gamma(G). We conjecture that in fact \beta(G) is at most \gamma(G)/2 (this would be best possible if true), and prove this conjecture in two special cases:   1. when V(G) is the union of two cliques,   2. when the vertices of G can be arranged in a circle such that if distinct u,v,w are in clockwise order and uw is a (directed) edge, then so are both uv and vw.
