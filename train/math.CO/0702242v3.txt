A \emph{quasi-polynomial} is a function defined of the form q(k) = c_d(k) k^d + c_{d-1}(k) k^{d-1} + ... + c_0(k), where c_0, c_1, ..., c_d are periodic functions in k \in \Z. Prominent examples of quasi-polynomials appear in Ehrhart's theory as integer-point counting functions for rational polytopes, and McMullen gives upper bounds for the periods of the c_j(k) for Ehrhart quasi-polynomials. For generic polytopes, McMullen's bounds seem to be sharp, but sometimes smaller periods exist. We prove that the second leading coefficient of an Ehrhart quasi-polynomial always has maximal expected period and present a general theorem that yields maximal periods for the coefficients of certain quasi-polynomials. We present a construction for (Ehrhart) quasi-polynomials that exhibit maximal period behavior and use it to answer a question of Zaslavsky on convolutions of quasi-polynomials.
