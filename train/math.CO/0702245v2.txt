Let K_m-H be the graph obtained from K_m by removing the edges set E(H) of H where H is a subgraph of K_m. In this paper, we characterize the potentially K_5-P_3, K_5-A_3, K_5-K_3 and K_5-K_{1,3}-graphic sequences where A_3 is P_2\cup K_2. Moreover, we also characterize the potentially K_5-2K_2-graphic sequences where pK_2 is the matching consisted of p edges.
