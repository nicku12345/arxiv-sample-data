We describe the computation of a catalogue containing all matroids with up to nine elements, and present some fundamental data arising from this cataogue. Our computation confirms and extends the results obtained in the 1960s by Blackburn, Crapo and Higgs. The matroids and associated data are stored in an online database, and we give three short examples of the use of this database.
