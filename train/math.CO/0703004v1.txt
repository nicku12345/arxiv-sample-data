We consider the relation between various permutation statistics and properties of permutation tableaux. We answer some of the questions of Steingrimsson and Williams (math.CO/0507149), in particular, on the distribution of the bistatistic of numbers of rows and essential ones in permutation tableaux. We also consider and enumerate sets of permutation tableaux related to some pattern restrictions on permutations.
