We consider a variety of connections between threshold graphs, shifted complexes, and simplicial complexes naturally formed from a graph. These graphical complexes include the independent set, neighborhood, and dominance complexes. We present a number of structural results and relations among them including new characterizations of the class of threshold graphs.
