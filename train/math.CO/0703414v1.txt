We start with an ``algebraic'' RSK-correspondence due to Noumi and Yamada. Given a matrix X, we consider a pyramidal array of solid minors of X. It turns out that this array satisfies an algebraic variant of octahedron recurrence. The main observation is that this array can also be constructed with the help of some square `genetic' array. Next we tropicalize this algebraic construction and consider T-{\em polarized} pyramidal arrays (that is arrays satisfying octahedral relations). As a result we get several bijections, viz: a) a linear bijection between non-negative arrays and supermodular functions; b) a piecewise linear bijection between supermodular functions and the so called infra-modular functions; c) a linear bijection between infra-modular functions and plane partitions. A composition of these bijections yields a bijection between non-negative arrays and plane partitions coinciding with the modified RSK-correspondence.
