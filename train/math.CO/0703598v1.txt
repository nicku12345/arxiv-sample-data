Let G=(V,E) be a simple graph. For a nonempty set X\subset V, and a vertex v\in V, \delta_{X}(v) denotes the number of neighbors v has in X. A nonempty set S\subset V is an \emph{offensive r-alliance} in G if \delta_S(v)\ge \delta_{\bar{S}}(v)+r, \forall v\in \partial (S), where \partial (S) denotes the boundary of S. An offensive r-alliance S is called \emph{global} if it forms a dominating set. The \emph{global offensive r-alliance number} of G, denoted by \gamma_{r}^{o}(G), is the minimum cardinality of a global offensive r-alliance in G. We show that the problem of finding optimal (global) offensive r-alliances is NP-complete and we obtain several tight bounds on \gamma_{r}^{o}(G).
