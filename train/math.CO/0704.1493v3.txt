The existence of a connected 12-regular \{K_4,K_{2,2,2}\}-ultrahomogeneous graph G is established, (i.e. each isomorphism between two copies of K_4 or K_{2,2,2} in G extends to an automorphism of G), with the 42 ordered lines of the Fano plane taken as vertices. This graph G can be expressed in a unique way both as the edge-disjoint union of 42 induced copies of K_4 and as the edge-disjoint union of 21 induced copies of K_{2,2,2}, with no more copies of K_4 or K_{2,2,2} existing in G. Moreover, each edge of G is shared by exactly one copy of K_4 and one of K_{2,2,2}. While the line graphs of d-cubes, (3\le d\in\ZZ), are \{K_d, K_{2,2}\}-ultrahomogeneous, G is not even line-graphical. In addition, the chordless 6-cycles of G are seen to play an interesting role and some self-dual configurations associated to G with 2-arc-transitive, arc-transitive and semisymmetric Levi graphs are considered.
