This work is concerned with some properties of the Young-Fibonacci insertion algorithm and its relation with Fomin's growth diagrams. It also investigates a relation between the combinatorics of Young-Fibonacci tableaux and the study of Okada's algebra associated to the Young-Fibonacci lattice. The original algorithm was introduced by Roby and we redefine it in such a way that both the insertion and recording tableaux of any permutation are \emph{conveniently} interpreted as chains in the Young-Fibonacci lattice. A property of Killpatrick's evacuation is given a simpler proof, but this evacuation is no longer needed in making Roby's and Fomin's constructions coincide. We provide the set of Young-Fibonacci tableaux of size n with a structure of graded poset, induced by the weak order on permutations of the symmetric group, and realized by transitive closure of elementary transformations on tableaux. We show that this poset gives a combinatorial interpretation of the coefficients in the transition matrix from the analogue of complete symmetric functions to analogue of the Schur functions in Okada's algebra. We end with a quite similar observation for four posets on Young-tableaux studied by Taskin.
