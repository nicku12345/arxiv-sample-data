A finite connected graph G_r^\sigma is constructed for 3\le r\in\mathbb{Z} and \sigma\in(0,r-1)\cap\mathbb{Z} via ordered binary projective pencils, with each copy of K_2 as intersection of two induced subgraphs of G_r^\sigma namely: {\bf(i)} a maximal clique X_0=K_{2s} with s=2^{r-\sigma-1} and {\bf(ii)} a maximal Tur\'an graph X_1=T_{ts,t} with t=2^{\sigma+1}-1. For i=0,1 it holds that G_r^\sigma: {\bf(a)} is an edge-disjoint union of copies of X_i; {\bf(b)} every copy of X_i in G_r^\sigma shares each of its edges with just one copy of X_{1-i} in G_r^\sigma; {\bf(c)} is K_4-ultrahomogeneous of order (2^r-1)(2^r-2) with 2^{\sigma+1} edge-disjoint copies of K_4 at each vertex if r-\sigma=2; {\bf(d)} satisfies a weak definition of \{K_{2s},T_{ts,t}\}-{\it homogeneous graphs} that include the \{K_4,T_{6,3}=K_{2,2,2}\}-ultrahomogeneous graph C_3^1, weak in that each induced copy of X_i is preserved with a distinguished arc. Computations for r\le 8 and r-\sigma\le 5 show G_r^\sigma to be the connected Menger graph of a corresponding configuration.
