A difference set is said to have classical parameters if  (v,k, \lambda) = (\frac{q^d-1}{q-1}, \frac{q^{d-1}-1}{q-1}, \frac{q^{d-2}-1}{q-1}). The case d=3 corresponds to planar difference sets. We focus here on the family of abelian difference sets with d=4. The only known examples of such difference sets correspond to the projective geometries PG(3,q). We consider an arbitrary difference set with the parameters of PG(3,q) in an abelian group and establish constraints on its structure. In particular, we discern embedded substructures.
