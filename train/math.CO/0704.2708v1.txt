For given matrix A\in\Z^{d\times n}, the set P_{b}=\{z:Az=b,z\in\Z^n_+\} describes the preimage or fiber of b\in\Z^d under the \Z-linear map f_A:\Z^n_+\to\Z^d, x\mapsto Ax. The fiber P_{b} is called atomic, if P_{b}=P_{b_1}+P_{b_2} implies b=b_1 or b=b_2. In this paper we present a novel algorithm to compute such atomic fibers. An algorithmic solution to appearing subproblems, computational examples and applications are included as well.
