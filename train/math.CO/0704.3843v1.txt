A {\bf map} is a graph that admits an orientation of its edges so that each vertex has out-degree exactly 1. We characterize graphs which admit a decomposition into k edge-disjoint maps after: (1) the addition of {\it any} \ell edges; (2) the addition of {\it some} \ell edges. These graphs are identified with classes of {\it sparse} graphs; the results are also given in matroidal terms.
