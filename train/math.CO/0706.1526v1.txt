We study vertex colorings of the square G^2 of an outerplanar graph G. We find the optimal bound of the inductiveness, chromatic number and the clique number of G^2 as a function of the maximum degree \Delta of G for all \Delta\in \nats. As a bonus, we obtain the optimal bound of the choosability (or the list-chromatic number) of G^2 when \Delta \geq 7. In the case of chordal outerplanar graphs, we classify exactly which graphs have parameters exceeding the absolute minimum.
