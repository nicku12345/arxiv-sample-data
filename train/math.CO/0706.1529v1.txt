A poset \mathbf{P} = (X,\preceq) is {\em m-partite} if X has a partition X = X_1 \cup ... \cup X_m such that (1) each X_i forms an antichain in \mathbf{P}, and (2) x\prec y implies x\in X_i and y\in X_j where i<j. In this article we derive a tight asymptotic upper bound on the order dimension of m-partite posets in terms of m and their bipartite sub-posets in a constructive and elementary way.
