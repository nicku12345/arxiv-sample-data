We present a definition of the class NP in combinatorial context as the set of languages of structures defined by finitely many forbidden lifted substructures. We apply this to special syntactically defined subclasses and show how they correspond to naturally defined (and intensively studied) combinatorial problems. We show that some types of combinatorial problems like edge colorings and graph decompositions express the full computational power of the class NP. We then characterize Constraint Satisfaction Problems (i.e. H-coloring problems) which are expressible by finitely many forbidden lifted substructures. This greatly simplifies and generalizes the earlier attempts to characterize this problem. As a corollary of this approach we perhaps find a proper setting of Feder and Vardi analysis of CSP languages within the class MMSNP.
