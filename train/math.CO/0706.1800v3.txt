In recent years, there has been considerable interest in showing that certain conditions on skew shapes A and B are sufficient for the difference s_A - s_B of their skew Schur functions to be Schur-positive. We determine necessary conditions for the difference to be Schur-positive. Our conditions are motivated by those of Reiner, Shaw and van Willigenburg that are necessary for s_A = s_B, and we deduce a strengthening of their result as a special case.
