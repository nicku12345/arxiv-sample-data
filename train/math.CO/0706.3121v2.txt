Maximal (k+1)-crossing-free graphs on a planar point set in convex position, that is, k-triangulations, have received attention in recent literature, with motivation coming from several interpretations of them.   We introduce a new way of looking at k-triangulations, namely as complexes of star polygons. With this tool we give new, direct, proofs of the fundamental properties of k-triangulations, as well as some new results. This interpretation also opens-up new avenues of research, that we briefly explore in the last section.
