After deriving inequalities on coefficients arising in the expansion of a Schur P-function in terms of Schur functions we give criteria for when such expansions are multiplicity free. From here we study the multiplicity of an irreducible spin character of the twisted symmetric group in the product of a basic spin character with an irreducible character of the symmetric group, and determine when it is multiplicity free.
