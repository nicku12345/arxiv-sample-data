We consider random Cayley digraphs of order n with uniformly distributed generating set of size k. Specifically, we are interested in the asymptotics of the probability such a Cayley digraph has diameter two as n\to\infty and k=f(n). We find a sharp phase transition from 0 to 1 at around k = \sqrt{n \log n}. In particular, if f(n) is asymptotically linear in n, the probability converges exponentially fast to 1.
