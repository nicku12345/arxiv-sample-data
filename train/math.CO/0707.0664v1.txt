In this paper we find asymptotic enumerations for the number of line graphs on n-labelled vertices and for different types of related combinatorial objects called 2-covers.   We find that the number of 2-covers, s_n, and proper 2-covers, t_n, on [n] both have asymptotic growth  s_n\sim t_n\sim B_{2n}2^{-n}\exp(-\frac12\log(2n/\log n))= B_{2n}2^{-n}\sqrt{\frac{\log n}{2n}},  where B_{2n} is the 2nth Bell number, while the number of restricted 2-covers, u_n, restricted, proper 2-covers on [n], v_n, and line graphs l_n, all have growth  u_n\sim v_n\sim l_n\sim B_{2n}2^{-n}n^{-1/2}\exp(-[\frac12\log(2n/\log n)]^2).    In our proofs we use probabilistic arguments for the unrestricted types of 2-covers and and generating function methods for the restricted types of 2-covers and line graphs.
