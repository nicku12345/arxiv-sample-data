We generalize some identities and q-identities previously known for the symmetric group to Coxeter groups of type B and D. The extended results include theorems of Foata and Sch\"utzenberger, Gessel, and Roselle on various distributions of inversion number, major index, and descent number. In order to show our results we provide caracterizations of the systems of minimal coset representatives of Coxeter groups of type B and D.
