Suppose that f is a function from Z_p -> [0,1] (Z_p is my notation for the integers mod p, not the p-adics), and suppose that a_1,...,a_k are some places in Z_p. In some additive number theory applications it would be nice to perturb f slightly so that Fourier transform f^ vanishes at a_1,...,a_k, while additive properties are left intact. In the present paper, we show that even if we are unsuccessful in this, we can at least say something interesting by using the principle of the separating hyperplane, a basic ingredient in linear programming duality.
