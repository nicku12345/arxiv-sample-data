A labeling of a graph is a bijection from E(G) to the set \{1, 2,..., |E(G)|\}. A labeling is \textit{antimagic} if for any distinct vertices u and v, the sum of the labels on edges incident to u is different from the sum of the labels on edges incident to v. We say a graph is antimagic if it has an antimagic labeling. In 1990, Ringel conjectured that every connected graph other than K_2 is antimagic. In this paper, we show that every regular bipartite graph (with degree at least 2) is antimagic. Our technique relies heavily on the Marriage Theorem.
