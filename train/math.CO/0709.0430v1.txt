We prove that the number of Hamiltonian paths on the complement of an acyclic digraph is equal to the number of cycle covers. As an application, we obtain a new expansion of the chromatic symmetric function of incomparability graphs in terms of elementary symmetric functions. Analysis of some of the combinatorial implications of this expansion leads to three bijections involving acyclic orientations.
