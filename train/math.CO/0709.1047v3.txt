We show that for each \alpha>0 every sufficiently large oriented graph G with \delta^+(G),\delta^-(G)\ge 3|G|/8+ \alpha |G| contains a Hamilton cycle. This gives an approximate solution to a problem of Thomassen. In fact, we prove the stronger result that G is still Hamiltonian if \delta(G)+\delta^+(G)+\delta^-(G)\geq 3|G|/2 + \alpha |G|. Up to the term \alpha |G| this confirms a conjecture of H\"aggkvist. We also prove an Ore-type theorem for oriented graphs.
