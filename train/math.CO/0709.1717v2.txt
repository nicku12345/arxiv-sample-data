We consider paths in the plane with (1,0), (0,1), and (a,b)-steps that start at the origin, end at height n, and stay to the left of a given non-decreasing right boundary. We show that if the boundary is periodic and has slope at most b/a, then the ordinary generating function for the number of such paths ending at height n is algebraic. Our argument is in two parts. We use a simple combinatorial decomposition to obtain an Appell relation or ``umbral'' generating function, in which the power z^n is replaced by a power series of the form z^n \phi_n(z), where \phi_n(0) = 1. Then we convert (in an explicit way) the umbral generating function to an ordinary generating function by solving a system of linear equations and a polynomial equation. This conversion implies that the ordinary generating function is algebraic.
