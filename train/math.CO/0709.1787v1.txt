We consider the number of vertices that must be removed from a graph G in order that the remaining subgraph has no component with more than k vertices. Our principal observation is that, if G is a sparse random graph or a random regular graph on n vertices with n tending to infinity, then the number in question is essentially the same for all values of k such that k tends to infinity but k=o(n).
