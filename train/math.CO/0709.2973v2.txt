The cycle structure of a Latin square autotopism \Theta=(\alpha,\beta,\gamma) is the triple (\mathbf{l}_{\alpha},\mathbf{l}_{\beta},\mathbf{l}_{\gamma}), where \mathbf{l}_{\delta} is the cycle structure of \delta, for all \delta\in\{\alpha,\beta,\gamma\}. In this paper we study some properties of these cycle structures and, as a consequence, we give a classification of all autotopisms of the Latin squares of order up to 11.
