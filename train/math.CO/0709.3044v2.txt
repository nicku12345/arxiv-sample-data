We show that recent determinant evaluations involving Catalan numbers and generalisations thereof have most convenient explanations by combining the Lindstr\"om-Gessel-Viennot theorem on non-intersecting lattice paths with a simple determinant lemma from [Manuscripta Math. 69 (1990), 173-202]. This approach leads also naturally to extensions and generalisations.
