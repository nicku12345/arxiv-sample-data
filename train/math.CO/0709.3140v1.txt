The energy of a graph G, denoted by E(G), is defined as the sum of the absolute values of all eigenvalues of G. Let G be a graph of order n and {\rm rank}(G) be the rank of the adjacency matrix of G. In this paper we characterize all graphs with E(G)={\rm rank}(G). Among other results we show that apart from a few families of graphs, E(G)\geq 2\max(\chi(G), n-\chi(\bar{G})), where n is the number of vertices of G, \bar{G} and \chi(G) are the complement and the chromatic number of G, respectively. Moreover some new lower bounds for E(G) in terms of {\rm rank}(G) are given.
