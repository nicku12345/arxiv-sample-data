Let \tau be a strongly (n,p;a,c) regular graph,such that 0<c<p<n-1, A his matrix of adjacency and let {\cal V}_{n} be the Euclidean space spanned by the powers of A over the reals where the scallar product \bullet|\bullet is defined by x|y={trace}(x \cdot y). In this work ones proves that {\cal V}_{n} is an Euclidean Jordan algebra of rank 3 when one introduces in {\cal V}_{n} the usual product of matrices. In this Euclidean Jordan algebra one defines the modulus of a matrix, and afterwards one defines |A|^x \forall x\in \mathbb{R}. Working inside the Euclidean Jordan algebra {\cal V}_{n} and making use of the properties of |A|^x one defines the generalized krein parameters of the strongly (n,p;a,c) regular graph \tau and finally one presents necessary conditions over the parameters and the spectra of the \tau strongly (n,p;a,c) regular graph.
