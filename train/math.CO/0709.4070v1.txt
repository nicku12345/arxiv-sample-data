Quasi-period collapse occurs when the Ehrhart quasi-polynomial of a rational polytope has a quasi-period less than the denominator of that polytope. This phenomenon is poorly understood, and all known cases in which it occurs have been proven with ad hoc methods. In this note, we present a conjectural explanation for quasi-period collapse in rational polytopes. We show that this explanation applies to some previous cases appearing in the literature. We also exhibit examples of Ehrhart polynomials of rational polytopes that are not the Ehrhart polynomials of any integral polytope.   Our approach depends on the invariance of the Ehrhart quasi-polynomial under the action of affine unimodular transformations. Motivated by the similarity of this idea to the scissors congruence problem, we explore the development of a Dehn-like invariant for rational polytopes in the lattice setting.
