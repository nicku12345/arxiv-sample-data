Let (W,S) be a finite Coxeter system acting by reflections on an \mathbb R-Euclidean space with simple roots \Delta=\{\a_s | s\in S\} of the same length and fundamental weights \Delta^*=\{v_s | s\in S\}. We set M(e)=\sum_{s\in S}\kappa_s v_s, \kappa_s>0, and for w\in W we set M(w)=w(M(e)). The permutahedron Perm(W) is the convex hull of the set \{M(w) | w\in W\}. Given a Coxeter element c\in W, we have defined in a previous work a generalized associahedron Asso_c(W) whose normal fan is the corresponding c-Cambrian fan F_c defined by N. Reading. By construction, Asso_c(W) is obtained from Perm(W) by removing some halfspaces according to a rule prescribed by c. In this work, we classify the isometry classes of these realizations. More precisely, for (W,S) an irreducible finite Coxeter system and c,c' two Coxeter elements in W, we have that Asso_{c}(W) and Asso_{c'}(W) are isometric if and only if \mu(c') = c or \mu(c')=w_0c^{-1}w_0 for \mu an automorphism of the Coxeter graph of W such that \kappa_s=\kappa_{\mu(s)} for all s\in S. As a byproduct, we classify the isometric Cambrian fans of W.
