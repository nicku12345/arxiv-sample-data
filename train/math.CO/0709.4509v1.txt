The Bernstein operators allow to build recursively the Schur functions. We present a recursion formula for k-Schur functions at t=1 based on combinatorial operators that generalize the Bernstein operators. The recursion leads immediately to a combinatorial interpretation for the expansion coefficients of k-Schur functions at t=1 in terms of homogeneous symmetric functions.
