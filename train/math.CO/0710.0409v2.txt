Let K_{m}-H be the graph obtained from K_{m} by removing the edges set E(H) of the graph H (H is a subgraph of K_{m}). We use the symbol Z_4 to denote K_4-P_2. A sequence S is potentially K_{m}-H-graphical if it has a realization containing a K_{m}-H as a subgraph. Let \sigma(K_{m}-H, n) denote the smallest degree sum such that every n-term graphical sequence S with \sigma(S)\geq \sigma(K_{m}-H, n) is potentially K_{m}-H-graphical. In this paper, we determine the values of \sigma (K_{r+1}-U, n) for   n\geq 5r+18, r+1 \geq k \geq 7, j \geq 6 where U is a graph on k vertices and j edges which contains a graph K_3 \bigcup P_3 but not contains a cycle on 4 vertices and not contains Z_4. There are a number of graphs on k vertices and j edges which contains a graph (K_{3} \bigcup P_{3}) but not contains a cycle on 4 vertices and not contains Z_4. (for example, C_3\bigcup C_{i_1} \bigcup C_{i_2} \bigcup >... \bigcup C_{i_p} (i_j\neq 4, j=2,3,..., p, i_1 \geq 5), C_3\bigcup P_{i_1} \bigcup P_{i_2} \bigcup ... \bigcup P_{i_p} (i_1 \geq 3), C_3\bigcup P_{i_1} \bigcup C_{i_2} \bigcup >... \bigcup C_{i_p} (i_j\neq 4, j=2,3,..., p, i_1 \geq 3), etc)
