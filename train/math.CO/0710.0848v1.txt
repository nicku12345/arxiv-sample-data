In recent years, The BPHZ algorithm for renormalization in quantum field theory has been interpreted, after dimensional regularization, as the Birkhoff-(Rota-Baxter) decomposition (BRB) of characters on the Hopf algebra of Feynmann graphs, with values in a Rota-Baxter algebra. We give in this paper formulas for the BRB decomposition in the group \mathcal{C}(H, A) of characters on a connected Hopf algebra H, with values in a Rota-Baxter (commutative) algebra A. To do so we first define the stuffle (or quasi-shuffle) Hopf algebra A^{\tmop{st}} associated to an algebra A. We prove then that for any connected Hopf algebra H = k 1_H \oplus H', there exists a canonical injective morphism from H to H'^{\tmop{st}}. This morphism induces an action of \mathcal{C}(A^{\tmop{st}}, A) on \mathcal{C}(H, A) so that the BRB decomposition in \mathcal{C}(H, A) is determined by the action of a unique (universal) element of \mathcal{C}(A^{\tmop{st}}, A).
