A latin bitrade (T^{\diamond}, T^{\otimes}) is a pair of partial latin squares which defines the difference between two arbitrary latin squares L^{\diamond} \supseteq T^{\diamond} and L^{\diamond} \supseteq T^{\otimes} of the same order. A 3-homogeneous bitrade (T^{\diamond}, T^{\otimes}) has three entries in each row, three entries in each column, and each symbol appears three times in T^{\diamond}. Cavenagh (2006) showed that any 3-homogeneous bitrade may be partitioned into three transversals. In this paper we provide an independent proof of Cavenagh's result using geometric methods. In doing so we provide a framework for studying bitrades as tessellations of spherical, euclidean or hyperbolic space.
