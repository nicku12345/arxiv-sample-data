We shall be interested in the following Erdos-Ko-Rado-type question. Fix some subset B of [n]. How large a family A of subsets of [n] can we find such that the intersection of any two sets in A contains a cyclic translate (modulo n) of B? Chung, Graham, Frankl and Shearer have proved that, in the case where B is a block of length t, we can do no better than to take A to consist of all supersets of B. We give an alternative proof of this result, which is in a certain sense more 'direct'.
