This is a companion note to ``Hochschild cohomology and Atiyah classes'' by Damien Calaque and the author. Using elementary methods we compute the Kontsevich weight of a wheel with spokes pointing outward. The result is in terms of modified Bernouilli numbers. The same result had been obtained earlier by Torossian (unpublished) and also recently by Thomas Willmacher using more advanced methods.
