A minor-closed class of graphs is a set of labelled graphs which is closed under isomorphism and under taking minors. For a minor-closed class C, we let c_n be the number of graphs in C which have n vertices. A recent result of Norine et al. shows that for all minor-closed class C, there is a constant r such that c_n < r^n n!. Our main results show that the growth rate of c_n is far from arbitrary. For example, no minor-closed class C has c_n= r^{n+o(n)} n! with 0 < r < 1 or 1 < r < \xi \approx 1.76.
