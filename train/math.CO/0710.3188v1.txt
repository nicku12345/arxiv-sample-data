Let W be an infinite irreducible Coxeter group with (s_1, ..., s_n) the simple generators. We give a simple proof that the word s_1 s_2 ... s_n s_1 s_2 >... s_n ... s_1 s_2 ... s_n is reduced for any number of repetitions of s_1 s_2 >... s_n. This result was proved for simply-laced, crystallographic groups by Kleiner and Pelley using methods from the theory of quiver representations. Our proof only using basic facts about Coxeter groups and the geometry of root systems.
