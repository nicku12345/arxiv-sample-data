A graph is k-linked if any k disjoint vertex-pairs can be joined by k disjoint paths. We improve a lower bound on the linkedness of polytopes slightly, which results in exact values for the minimal linkedness of 7-, 10- and 13-dimensional polytopes.   We analyze in detail linkedness of polytopes on at most (6d+7)/5 vertices. In that case, a sharp lower bound on minimal linkedness is derived, and examples meeting this lower bound are constructed. These examples contain a class of examples due to Gallivan.
