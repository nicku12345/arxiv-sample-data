We consider a Q-polynomial distance-regular graph \Gamma with vertex set X and diameter D \geq 3. For \mu, \nu \in \lbrace \downarrow, \uparrow \rbrace we define a direct sum decomposition of the standard module V=\C X, called the (\mu,\nu)--split decomposition. For this decomposition we compute the complex conjugate and transpose of the associated primitive idempotents. Now fix b,\beta \in \mathbb C such that b \neq 1 and assume \Gamma has classical parameters (D,b,\alpha,\beta) with \alpha = b-1. Under this assumption Ito and Terwilliger displayed an action of the q-tetrahedron algebra \boxtimes_q on the standard module of \Gamma. To describe this action they defined eight matrices in   \hbox{Mat}_X(\mathbb C), called \begin{eqnarray*} \label{eq:list} A,\quad A^*,\quad B,\quad B^*, \quad K,\quad K^*,\quad \Phi,\quad \Psi. \end{eqnarray*}   For each matrix in the above list we compute the transpose and complex conjugate. Using this information we compute the transpose and complex conjugate for each generator of \boxtimes_q on V.
