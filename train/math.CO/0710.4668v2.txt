The well know theorem of Tverberg states that if n > (d+1)(r-1) then one can partition any set of n points in R^d to r disjoint subsets whose convex hulls have a common point. The numbers T(d,r) = (d + 1)(r - 1) + 1 are known as Tverberg numbers. Reay asks the following question: if we add an additional parameter k (1 < k < r+1) what is the minimal number of points we need in order to guarantee that there exists an r partition of them such that any k of the r convex hulls intersect. This minimal number is denoted by T(d,r,k). Reay conjectured that T(d,r,k) = T(d,r) for all d,r and k. In this article we prove that this is true for the following cases: when k > [ (d+3)/2 ]-1 or when d < rk/(r-k)-1 and for the specific values d = 3; r = 4; k = 2 and d = 5; r = 3; k = 2.
