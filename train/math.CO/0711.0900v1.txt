The aim of this work is to study some lattice diagram determinants \Delta_L(X,Y). We recall that M_L denotes the space of all partial derivatives of \Delta_L. In this paper, we want to study the space M^k_{i,j}(X,Y) which is defined as the sum of M_L spaces where the lattice diagrams L are obtained by removing k cells from a given partition, these cells being in the ``shadow'' of a given cell (i,j) in a fixed Ferrers diagram. We obtain an upper bound for the dimension of the resulting space M^k_{i,j}(X,Y), that we conjecture to be optimal. This dimension is a multiple of n! and thus we obtain a generalization of the n! conjecture. Moreover, these upper bounds associated to nice properties of some special symmetric differential operators (the ``shift'' operators) allow us to construct explicit bases in the case of one set of variables, i.e. for the subspace M^k_{i,j}(X) consisting of elements of 0 Y-degree.
