The aim of this work is to study some lattice diagram polynomials \Delta_D(X,Y). We recall that M_D denotes the space of all partial derivatives of \Delta_D. In this paper, we want to study the space M^k_{i,j}(X,Y) which is the sum of M_D spaces where the lattice diagrams D are obtained by removing k cells from a given partition, these cells being in the ``shadow'' of a given cell (i,j) of the Ferrers diagram. We obtain an upper bound for the dimension of the resulting space M^k_{i,j}(X,Y), that we conjecture to be optimal. These upper bounds allow us to construct explicit bases for the subspace M^k_{i,j}(X) consisting of elements of 0 Y-degree.
