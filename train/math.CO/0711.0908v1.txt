The aim of this work is to extend the study of super-coinvariant polynomials, to the case of the generalized symmetric group G_{n,m}, defined as the wreath product C_m\wr\S_n of the symmetric group by the cyclic group. We define a quasi-symmetrizing action of G_{n,m} on \Q[x_1,...,x_n], analogous to those defined by Hivert in the case of \S_n. The polynomials invariant under this action are called quasi-invariant, and we define super-coinvariant polynomials as polynomials orthogonal, with respect to a given scalar product, to the quasi-invariant polynomials with no constant term. Our main result is the description of a Gr\"obner basis for the ideal generated by quasi-invariant polynomials, from which we dedece that the dimension of the space of super-coinvariant polynomials is equal to m^n C_n where C_n is the n-th Catalan number.
