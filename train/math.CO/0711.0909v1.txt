A classical result of Artin states that the ideal generated by symmetric polynomials in n variables is of codimension n!. The author, F. Bergeron and N. Bergeron have recently obtained a surprising analogous in the case of quasi-symmetric polynomials. In this case, the ideal is of codimension given by C_n, the n-th Catalan number. Quasi-symmetric polynomials are the invariants of a certain action of the symmetric group S_n defined by F. Hivert. The aim of this work is to generalize these results to the wreath product S_n\wr \Z_m, also known as the generalized symmetric group G\nm. We first define a quasi-symmetrizing action of G\nm on \C[x_1,...,x_n], then obtain a description of the invariants and the codimension of the associated ideal, which is m^n C_n.
