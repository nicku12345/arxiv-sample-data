We show there is an uncountable number of parallel total perfect codes in the integer lattice graph {\Lambda} of \R^2. In contrast, there is just one 1-perfect code in {\Lambda} and one total perfect code in {\Lambda} restricting to total perfect codes of rectangular grid graphs (yielding an asymmetric, Penrose, tiling of the plane). We characterize all cycle products C_m\times C_n with parallel total perfect codes, and the d-perfect and total perfect code partitions of {\Lambda} and C_m\times C_n, the former having as quotient graph the undirected Cayley graphs of \Z_{2d^2+2d+1} with generator set \{1,2d^2\}. For r>1, generalization for 1-perfect codes is provided in the integer lattice of \R^r and in the products of r cycles, with partition quotient graph K_{2r+1} taken as the undirected Cayley graph of \Z_{2r+1} with generator set \{1,...,r\}.
