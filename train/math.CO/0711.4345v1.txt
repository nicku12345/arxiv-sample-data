A dominating set S in a graph G is said to be perfect if every vertex of G not in S is adjacent to just one vertex of S. Given a vertex subset S' of a side P_m of an m\times n grid graph G, the perfect dominating sets S in G with S'=S\cap V(P_m) can be determined via an exhaustive algorithm \Theta of running time O(2^{m+n}). Extending \Theta to infinite grid graphs of width m-1, periodicity makes the binary decision tree of \Theta prunable into a finite threaded tree, a closed walk of which yields all such sets S. The graphs induced by the complements of such sets S can be codified by arrays of ordered pairs of positive integers via \Theta, for the growth and determination of which a speedier %greedy algorithm exists. %and their periodic structure, further studied. A recent characterization of grid graphs having total perfect codes S (with just 1-cubes as induced components), due to Klostermeyer and Goldwasser, is given in terms of \Theta, which allows to show that these sets S are restrictions of only one total perfect code S_1 in the integer lattice graph {\Lambda} of \R^2. Moreover, the complement {\Lambda}-S_1 yields an aperiodic tiling, like the Penrose tiling. In contrast, the parallel, horizontal, total perfect codes in {\Lambda} are in 1-1 correspondence with the doubly infinite \{0,1\}-sequences.
