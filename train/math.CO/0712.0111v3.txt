This article presents uniform random generators of plane partitions according to the size (the number of cubes in the 3D interpretation). Combining a bijection of Pak with the method of Boltzmann sampling, we obtain random samplers that are slightly superlinear: the complexity is O(n (\ln n)^3) in approximate-size sampling and O(n^{4/3}) in exact-size sampling   (under a real-arithmetic computation model). To our knowledge, these are the first polynomial-time samplers for plane partitions according to the size (there exist polynomial-time samplers of another type, which draw plane partitions that fit inside a fixed bounding box). The same principles yield efficient samplers for (a\times b)-boxed plane partitions (plane partitions with two dimensions bounded), and for skew plane partitions. The random samplers allow us to perform simulations and observe limit shapes and frozen boundaries, which have been analysed recently by Cerf and Kenyon for plane partitions, and by Okounkov and Reshetikhin for skew plane partitions.
