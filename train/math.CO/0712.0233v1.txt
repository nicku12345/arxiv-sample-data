Let P be a partial latin square of prime order p>7 consisting of three cyclically generated transversals. Specifically, let P be a partial latin square of the form: \[ P=\{(i,c+i,s+i),(i,c'+i,s'+i),(i,c''+i,s''+i)\mid 0 \leq i< p\} \] for some distinct c,c',c'' and some distinct s,s',s''. In this paper we show that any such P completes to a latin square which is diagonally cyclic.
