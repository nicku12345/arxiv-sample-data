The sequence counting the number of unique tournaments with n people is the same as the sequence counting non-tracking binary strings corresponding to n-2 radar observations with the tracking rule "3 out of 5 with loss 2." This fact allows us to build a bijection between unique tournaments and non-tracking binary strings.
