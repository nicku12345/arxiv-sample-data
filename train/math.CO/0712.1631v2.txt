We determine the spectra of cubic plane graphs whose faces have sizes 3 and 6. Such graphs, "(3,6)-fullerenes", have been studied by chemists who are interested in their energy spectra. In particular we prove a conjecture of Fowler, which asserts that all their eigenvalues come in pairs of the form \{\lambda,-\lambda\} except for the four eigenvalues \{3,-1,-1,-1\}. We exhibit other families of graphs which are "spectrally nearly bipartite" in this sense. Our proof utilizes a geometric representation to recognize the algebraic structure of these graphs, which turn out to be examples of Cayley sum graphs.
