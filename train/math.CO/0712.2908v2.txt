The Cops and Robber game is played on undirected finite graphs. k cops and one robber are positioned on vertices and take turn in moving along edges. The cops win if, after a move, a cop and the robber are on the same vertex. A graph is called k-copwin, if the cops have a winning strategy.   It is known that planar graphs are 3-copwin (Aigner & Fromme, 1984) and that outerplanar graphs are 2-copwin (Clarke, 2002). In this short note, we prove that series-parallel (i.e., graphs with no K_4 minor) graphs are 2-copwin.   It is a well-known trick in the literature of cops & robber games to define variants of the game which impose restrictions on the possible strategies of the cops (see Clarke, 2002). For our proof, we define the ``cops & robber game with exits''.   Our proof yields a winning strategy for the cops.
