Let \Psi(t,k) denote the set of pairs (v,\lambda) for which there exists a graphical t-(v,k,\lambda) design. Most results on graphical designs have gone to show the finiteness of \Psi(t,k) when t and k satisfy certain conditions. The exact determination of \Psi(t,k) for specified t and k is a hard problem and only \Psi(2,3), \Psi(2,4), \Psi(3,4), \Psi(4,5), and \Psi(5,6) have been determined. In this paper, we determine completely the sets \Psi(2,5) and \Psi(3,5). As a result, we find more than 270000 inequivalent graphical designs, and more than 8000 new parameter sets for which there exists a graphical design. Prior to this, graphical designs are known for only 574 parameter sets.
