We consider functions f:B\to\Rset that obey tropical analogs of classical Pl\"ucker relations on minors of a matrix. The most general set B that we deal with in this paper is of the form \{x\in \Zset^n\colon 0\le x\le a, m\le x_1+...+x_n\le m'\} (a rectangular integer box ``truncated from below and above''). We construct a basis for the set \Tscr of tropical Pl\"ucker functions on B, a subset \Bscr\subseteq B such that the restriction map \Tscr\to\Rset^\Bscr is bijective. Also we characterize, in terms of the restriction to the basis, the classes of submodular, so-called skew-submodular, and discrete concave functions in \Tscr, discuss a tropical analogue of the Laurentness property, and present other results.
