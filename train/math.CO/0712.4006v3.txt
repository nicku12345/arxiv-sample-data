We establish a phase transition for permutation classes (downsets of permutations under the permutation containment order): there is an algebraic number \kappa, approximately 2.20557, for which there are only countably many permutation classes of growth rate (Stanley-Wilf limit) less than \kappa but uncountably many permutation classes of growth rate \kappa, answering a question of Klazar. We go on to completely characterize the possible sub-\kappa growth rates of permutation classes, answering a question of Kaiser and Klazar. Central to our proofs are the concepts of generalized grid classes (introduced herein), partial well-order, and atomicity (also known as the joint embedding property).
