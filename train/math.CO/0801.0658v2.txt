For given a graph H, a graphic sequence \pi=(d_1,d_2,...,d_n) is said to be potentially   H-graphic if there exists a realization of \pi containing H as a subgraph. In this paper, we characterize the potentially H-graphic sequences where H denotes 3-regular graph with 6 vertices. In other words, we characterize the potentially K_{3,3} and K_6-C_6-graphic sequences where K_{r,r} is an r\times r complete bipartite graph. One of these characterizations implies a theorem due to Yin [25].
