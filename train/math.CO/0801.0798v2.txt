We discuss a problem posed by Ronald Graham about the minimum number, over all 2-colorings of [1,n], of monochromatic \{x,y,x+ay\} triples for a \geq 1. We give a new proof of the original case of a=1. We show that the minimum number of such triples is at most \frac{n^2}{2a(a^2+2a+3)} + O(n) when a \geq 2. We also find a new upper bound for the minimum number, over all r-colorings of [1,n], of monochromatic Schur triples, for r \geq 3.
