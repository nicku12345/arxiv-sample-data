For any lattice polytope P, we consider an associated polynomial \bar{\delta}_{P}(t) and describe its decomposition into a sum of two polynomials satisfying certain symmetry conditions. As a consequence, we improve upon known inequalities satisfied by the coefficients of the Ehrhart \delta-vector of a lattice polytope. We also provide combinatorial proofs of two results of Stanley that were previously established using techniques from commutative algebra. Finally, we give a necessary numerical criterion for the existence of a regular unimodular lattice triangulation of the boundary of a lattice polytope.
