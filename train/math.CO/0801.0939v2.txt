Given a d-dimensional convex polytope P and nonnegative integer k not exceeding d-1, let G_k (P) denote the simple graph on the node set of k-dimensional faces of P in which two such faces are adjacent if there exists a (k+1)-dimensional face of P which contains them both. The graph G_k (P) is isomorphic to the dual graph of the (d-k)-dimensional skeleton of the normal fan of P. For fixed values of k and d, the largest integer m such that G_k (P) is m-vertex-connected for all d-dimensional polytopes P is determined. This result generalizes Balinski's theorem on the one-dimensional skeleton of a d-dimensional convex polytope.
