We define an enumerative function F(n,k,P,m) which is a generalization of binomial coefficients. Special cases of this function are also power function, factorials, rising factorials and falling factorials.   The first section of the paper is an introduction.   In the second section we derive an explicit formula for F. From the expression for the power function we obtain a number theory result.   Then we derive a formula which shows that the case of arbitrary m may be reduced to the case m=0. This formula extends Vandermonde convolution.   In the second section we describe F by the series of recurrence relations with respect to each of arguments k, n, and P. As a special case of the first recurrence relation we state a binomial identity. As a consequence of the second recurrence relation we obtain relation for coefficients of Chebyshev polynomial of both kind. This means that these polynomials might be defined in pure combinatorial way.
