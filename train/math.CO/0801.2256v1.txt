For the set of graphs with a given degree sequence, consisting of any number of 2's and 1's, and its subset of bipartite graphs, we characterize the optimal graphs who maximize and minimize the number of m-matchings. We find the expected value of the number of m-matchings of r-regular bipartite graphs on 2n vertices with respect to the two standard measures. We state and discuss the conjectured upper and lower bounds for m-matchings in r-regular bipartite graphs on 2n vertices, and their asymptotic versions for infinite r-regular bipartite graphs. We prove these conjectures for 2-regular bipartite graphs and for m-matchings with m\le 4.
