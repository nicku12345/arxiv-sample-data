Motivated by a connection between semi-regular relative difference sets and mutually unbiased bases, we study relative difference sets with parameters (m,n,m,m/n) in groups of non-prime-power orders. Let p be an odd prime. We prove that there does not exist a (2p,p,2p,2) relative difference set in any group of order 2p^2, and an abelian (4p,p,4p,4) relative difference set can only exist in the group \Bbb{Z}_2^2\times \Bbb{Z}_3^2. On the other hand, we construct a family of non-abelian relative difference sets with parameters (4q,q,4q,4), where q is an odd prime power greater than 9 and q\equiv 1 (mod 4). When q=p is a prime, p>9, and p\equiv 1 (mod 4), the (4p,p,4p,4) non-abelian relative difference sets constructed here are genuinely non-abelian in the sense that there does not exist an abelian relative difference set with the same parameters.
