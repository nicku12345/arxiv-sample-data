A tournament is \emph{acyclically indecomposable} if no acyclic autonomous set of vertices has more than one element. We identify twelve infinite acyclically indecomposable tournaments and prove that every infinite acyclically indecomposable tournament contains a subtournament isomorphic to one of these tournaments. The {\it profile} of a tournament T is the function \phi_T which counts for each integer n the number \phi_T(n) of tournaments induced by T on the n-element subsets of T, isomorphic tournaments being identified. As a corollary of the result above we deduce that the growth of \phi_T is either polynomial, in which case \phi_T(n)\simeq an^k, for some positive real a, some non-negative integer k, or as fast as some exponential.
