Let \alpha:\mathbb{Z}_n\to\mathbb{Z}_n be a permutation and \Psi(\alpha) be the number of collinear triples modulo n in the graph of \alpha. Cooper and Solymosi had given by induction the bound \min_{\alpha}\Psi(\alpha)\geq\lceil(n-1)/4\rceil when n is a prime number. The main purpose of this paper is to give a direct proof of that bound. Besides, the expected number of collinear triples a permutation can have is also been determined.
