We enumerate graph homomorphisms to quasi-complete graphs, i.e., graphs obtained from complete graphs by removing one edge. The source graphs are complete graphs, quasi-complete graphs, cycles, paths, wheels and broken wheels. These enumerations give rise to sequences of integers with two indices; one of the indices is the number of vertices of the source graph, and the other index is the number of vertices of the target graph.
