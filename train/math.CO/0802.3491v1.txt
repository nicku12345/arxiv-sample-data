In this paper we enumerate k-noncrossing tangled-diagrams. A tangled-diagram is a labeled graph whose vertices are 1,...,n have degree \le 2, and are arranged in increasing order in a horizontal line. Its arcs are drawn in the upper halfplane with a particular notion of crossings and nestings. Our main result is the asymptotic formula for the number of k-noncrossing tangled-diagrams T_{k}(n) \sim c_k n^{-((k-1)^2+(k-1)/2)} (4(k-1)^2+2(k-1)+1)^n for some c_k>0.
