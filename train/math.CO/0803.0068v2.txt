A vertex 2-coloring of a graph is said to be perfect with parameters (a_{ij})_{i,j=1}^k if for every i,j\in\{1,...,k\} every vertex of color i is adjacent with exactly a_{ij} vertices of color j. We consider the perfect 2-colorings of the distance-2 graph of the 24-cube \{0,1\}^{24} with parameters ((20+c,256-c)(c,276-c)) (i.e., with eigenvalue 20). We prove that such colorings exist for all c from 1 to 128 except 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 10, 13 and do not exist for c=1, 2, 4, 5, 7. Keywords: perfect coloring, equitable partition, hypercube, halved n-cube
