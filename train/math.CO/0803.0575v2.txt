Any subset Q' of the domain Q of a learning space defines a projection of that learning space on Q' which is itself a learning space consistent with the original one. Moreover, such a construction defines a partition of Q having each of its classes defining a learning space also consistent with the original learning space. We give a direct proof of these facts which are instrumental in parsing large learning spaces.
