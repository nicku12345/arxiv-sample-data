The Baxter number can be written as B_n = \sum_0^n \Theta_{k,n-k-1}. These numbers have first appeared in the enumeration of so-called Baxter permutations; B_n is the number of Baxter permutations of size n, and \Theta_{k,l} is the number of Baxter permutations with k descents and l rises. With a series of bijections we identify several families of combinatorial objects counted by the numbers \Theta_{k,l}. Apart from Baxter permutations, these include plane bipolar orientations with k+2 vertices and l+2 faces, 2-orientations of planar quadrangulations with k+2 white and l+2 black vertices, certain pairs of binary trees with k+1 left and l+1 right leaves, and a family of triples of non-intersecting lattice paths. This last family allows us to determine the value of \Theta_{k,l} as an application of the lemma of Gessel and Viennot. The approach also allows us to count certain other subfamilies, e.g., alternating Baxter permutations, objects with symmetries and, via a bijection with a class of plan bipolar orientations also Schnyder woods of triangulations, which are known to be in bijection with 3-orientations.
