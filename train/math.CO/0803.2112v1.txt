We introduce an infinite family of lower triangular matrices \Gamma^{(s)}, where \gamma_{n,i}^s counts the standard Young tableaux on n cells and with at most s columns on a suitable subset of shapes. We show that the entries of these matrices satisfy a three-term row recurrence and we deduce recursive and asymptotic properties for the total number \tau_s(n) of tableaux on n cells and with at most s columns.
