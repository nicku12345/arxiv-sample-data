In this paper, we prove that the set of triangulations of a polygon can be equipped with an order to become a lattice. First, we define this order. In [HN99], authors defined the flip operator and then prove some properties of the graph of triangulations. We use their theorems and extend them to construct the lattice of triangulations. We prove this lattice property and introduce an elegant algorithm which correctness is induced from the proof. The complexity of this algorithm will be considered. This algorithm is efficient to find the infimum of a pair of triangulations.
