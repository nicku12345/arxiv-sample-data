Mayer's theory of cluster integrals allows one to write the partition function of a gas model as a generating function of weighted graphs. Recently, Labelle, Leroux and Ducharme have studied the graph weights arising from the one-dimensional hard-core gas model and noticed that the sum of the weights over all connected graphs with n vertices is (-n)^{n-1}. This is, up to sign, the number of rooted Cayley trees on n vertices and the authors asked for a combinatorial explanation. The main goal of this article is to provide such an explanation.
