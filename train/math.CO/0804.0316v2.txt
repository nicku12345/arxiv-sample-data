In this paper we prove several new stability results for the reconstruction of binary images from two projections. We consider an original image that is uniquely determined by its projections and possible reconstructions from slightly different projections. We show that for a given difference in the projections, the reconstruction can only be disjoint from the original image if the size of the image is not too large. We also prove an upper bound for the size of the image given the error in the projections and the size of the intersection between the image and the reconstruction.
