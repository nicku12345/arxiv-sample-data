Geometrical objects with integral sides have attracted mathematicians for ages. For example, the problem to prove or to disprove the existence of a perfect box, that is, a rectangular parallelepiped with all edges, face diagonals and space diagonals of integer lengths, remains open. More generally an integral point set \mathcal{P} is a set of n points in the m-dimensional Euclidean space \mathbb{E}^m with pairwise integral distances where the largest occurring distance is called its diameter. From the combinatorial point of view there is a natural interest in the determination of the smallest possible diameter d(m,n) for given parameters m and n. We give some new upper bounds for the minimum diameter d(m,n) and some exact values.
