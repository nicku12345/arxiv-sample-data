There are many papers studying properties of point sets in the Euclidean space \mathbb{E}^m or on integer grids \mathbb{Z}^m, with pairwise integral or rational distances. In this article we consider the distances or coordinates of the point sets which instead of being integers are elements of \mathbb{Z} / \mathbb{Z}n, and study the properties of the resulting combinatorial structures.
