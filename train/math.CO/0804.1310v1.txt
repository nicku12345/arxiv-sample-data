We determine the numbers of integral tetrahedra with diameter d up to isomorphism for all d\le 1000 via computer enumeration. Therefore we give an algorithm that enumerates the integral tetrahedra with diameter at most d in O(d^5) time and an algorithm that can check the canonicity of a given integral tetrahedron with at most 6 integer comparisons. For the number of isomorphism classes of integral 4\times 4 matrices with diameter d fulfilling the triangle inequalities we derive an exact formula.
