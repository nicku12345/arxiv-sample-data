Let \ell,k be fixed positive integers. In an earlier work, the first and third authors established a bijection between \ell-cores with first part equal to k and (\ell-1)-cores with first part less than or equal to k. This paper gives several new interpretations of that bijection. The \ell-cores index minimal length coset representatives for \widetilde{S_{\ell}} / S_{\ell} where \widetilde{S_{\ell}} denotes the affine symmetric group and S_{\ell} denotes the finite symmetric group. In this setting, the bijection has a beautiful geometric interpretation in terms of the root lattice of type A_{\ell-1}. We also show that the bijection has a natural description in terms of another correspondence due to Lapointe and Morse.
