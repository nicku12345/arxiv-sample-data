Let \Gamma denote a distance-regular graph with diameter D \ge 3. Assume \Gamma has classical parameters (D,b,\alpha,\beta) with b < -1. Let X denote the vertex set of \Gamma and let A \in MX denote the adjacency matrix of \Gamma. Fix x \in X and let A^* \in MX denote the corresponding dual adjacency matrix. Let T denote the subalgebra of MX generated by A, A^*. We call T the {\em Terwilliger algebra} of \Gamma with respect to x. We show that up to isomorphism there exist exactly two irreducible T-modules with endpoint 1; their dimensions are D and 2D-2. For these T-modules we display a basis consisting of eigenvectors for A^*, and for each basis we give the action of A
