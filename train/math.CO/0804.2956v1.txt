We want to introduce a construction of spherical designs from finite graphs with the theory of crystal lattice. We start from a finite graph, and we consider standard realization of the crystal lattices as the maximal Abelian covering of the graph. Then, we take the set of vectors which form the crystal lattice. If every vector has the same norm, then we can consider a finite set on Euclidean sphere, and then we get a spherical design.   In this paper, we observe the results by numerical calculations. We tried constructing vectors from various finite graphs, strongly regular graphs, distance regular graphs, and so on. We also introduce some facts and conjectures.
