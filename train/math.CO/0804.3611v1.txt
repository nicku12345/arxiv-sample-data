We derive an identity for certain linear combinations of polylogarithm functions with negative exponents, which implies relations for linear combinations of Eulerian numbers. The coefficients of our linear combinations are related to expanding moments of Satake parameters of holomorphic cuspidal newforms in terms of the moments of the corresponding Fourier coefficients, which has applications in analyzing lower order terms in the behavior of zeros of L-functions near the central point.
