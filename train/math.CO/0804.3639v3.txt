For every positive integer n, consider the linear operator \U_{n} on polynomials of degree at most d with integer coefficients defined as follows: if we write \frac{h(t)}{(1 - t)^{d + 1}} = \sum_{m \geq 0} g(m) t^{m}, for some polynomial g(m) with rational coefficients, then \frac{\U_{n}h(t)}{(1- t)^{d + 1}} = \sum_{m \geq 0} g(nm) t^{m}. We show that there exists a positive integer n_{d}, depending only on d, such that if h(t) is a polynomial of degree at most d with nonnegative integer coefficients and h(0) \geq 1, then for n \geq n_{d}, \U_{n}h(t) has simple, real, strictly negative roots and positive, strictly log concave and strictly unimodal coefficients. Applications are given to Ehrhart \delta-polynomials and unimodular triangulations of dilations of lattice polytopes, as well as Hilbert series of Veronese subrings of Cohen--MacCauley graded rings.
