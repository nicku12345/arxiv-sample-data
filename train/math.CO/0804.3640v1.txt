A graph G(V,E) of order |V|=p and size |E|=q is called super edge-graceful if there is a bijection f from E to \{0,\pm 1,\pm 2,...,\pm \frac{q-1}{2}\} when q is odd and from E to \{\pm 1,\pm 2,...,\pm \frac{q}{2}\} when q is even such that the induced vertex labeling f^* defined by f^*(x) = \sum_{xy\in E(G)}f(xy) over all edges xy is a bijection from V to \{0,\pm 1,\pm 2...,\pm \frac{p-1}{2}\} when p is odd and from V to \{\pm 1,\pm 2,...,\pm \frac{p}{2}\} when p is even. \indent We prove that all paths P_n except P_2 and P_4 are super edge-graceful.
