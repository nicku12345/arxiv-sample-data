The \emph{distance-number} of a graph G is the minimum number of distinct edge-lengths over all straight-line drawings of G in the plane. This definition generalises many well-known concepts in combinatorial geometry. We consider the distance-number of trees, graphs with no K^-_4-minor, complete bipartite graphs, complete graphs, and cartesian products. Our main results concern the distance-number of graphs with bounded degree. We prove that n-vertex graphs with bounded maximum degree and bounded treewidth have distance-number in \mathcal{O}(\log n). To conclude such a logarithmic upper bound, both the degree and the treewidth need to be bounded. In particular, we construct graphs with treewidth 2 and polynomial distance-number. Similarly, we prove that there exist graphs with maximum degree 5 and arbitrarily large distance-number. Moreover, as \Delta increases the existential lower bound on the distance-number of \Delta-regular graphs tends to \Omega(n^{0.864138}).
