The set of all non-increasing nonnegative integers sequence \pi=   (d(v_1), d(v_2), ..., d(v_n)) is denoted by NS_n.   A sequence \pi\in NS_n is said to be graphic if it is the degree sequence of a simple graph G on n vertices, and such a graph G is called a realization of \pi. The set of all graphic sequences in NS_n is denoted by GS_n. A graphical sequence \pi is potentially H-graphical if there is a realization of \pi containing H as a subgraph, while \pi is forcibly H-graphical if every realization of \pi contains H as a subgraph. Let K_k denote a complete graph on k vertices. Let K_{m}-H be the graph obtained from K_{m} by removing the edges set E(H) of the graph H (H is a subgraph of K_{m}). This paper summarizes briefly some recent results on potentially K_{m}-G-graphic sequences and give a useful classification for determining \sigma(H,n).
