In this note we give two results. First, if a latin bitrade (T_1, T_2) is primary, thin, separated, and the autotopism group of T_1 acts regularly on T_1, then (T_1, T_2) may be derived from a group-based construction. Second, if a latin bitrade (T_1, T_2) has genus 0 then the disjoint mate T_2 is unique and the autotopism group of T_1 is equal to the autotopism group of T_2.
