Let \alpha:\mathbb{F}_q\to\mathbb{F}_q be a permutation and \Psi(\alpha) be the number of collinear triples in the graph of \alpha, where \mathbb{F}_q denotes a finite field of q elements. When q is odd Cooper and Solymosi once proved \Psi(\alpha)\geq(q-1)/4 and conjectured the sharp bound should be \Psi(\alpha)\geq(q-1)/2. In this note we indicate that the Cooper-Solymosi conjecture is true.
