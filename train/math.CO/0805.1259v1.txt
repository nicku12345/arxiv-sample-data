Polygons are described as almost-convex if their perimeter differs from the perimeter of their minimum bounding rectangle by twice their `concavity index', m. Such polygons are called \emph{m-convex} polygons and are characterised by having up to m indentations in their perimeter. We first describe how we conjectured the (isotropic) generating function for the case m=2 using a numerical procedure based on series expansions. We then proceed to prove this result for the more general case of the full anisotropic generating function, in which steps in the x and y direction are distinguished. In so doing, we develop tools that would allow for the case m > 2 to be studied. %In our proof we use a `divide and conquer' approach, factorising 2-convex %polygons by extending a line along the base of its indents. We then use %the inclusion-exclusion principle, the Hadamard product and extensions to %known methods to derive the generating functions for each case.
