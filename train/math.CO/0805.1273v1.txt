A {\em k-generalized Dyck path} of length n is a lattice path from (0,0) to (n,0) in the plane integer lattice \mathbb{Z}\times\mathbb{Z} consisting of horizontal-steps (k, 0) for a given integer k\geq 0, up-steps (1,1), and down-steps (1,-1), which never passes below the x-axis. The present paper studies three kinds of statistics on k-generalized Dyck paths: "number of u-segments", "number of internal u-segments" and "number of (u,h)-segments". The Lagrange inversion formula is used to represent the generating function for the number of k-generalized Dyck paths according to the statistics as a sum of the partial Bell polynomials or the potential polynomials. Many important special cases are considered leading to several surprising observations. Moreover, enumeration results related to u-segments and (u,h)-segments are also established, which produce many new combinatorial identities, and specially, two new expressions for Catalan numbers.
