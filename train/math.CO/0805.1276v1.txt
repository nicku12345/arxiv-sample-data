In this paper we enumerate the number of ways of selecting k objects from n objects arrayed in a line such that no two selected ones are separated by m-1,2m-1,...,pm-1 objects and provide three different formulas when m,p\geq 1 and n\geq pm(k-1). Also, we prove that the number of ways of selecting k objects from n objects arrayed in a circle such that no two selected ones are separated by m-1,2m-1,...,pm-1 objects is given by \frac{n}{n-pk}\binom{n-pk}{k}, where m,p\geq 1 and n\geq mpk+1.
