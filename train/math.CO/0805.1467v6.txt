A partition of degree n is a decomposition n=i_1+i_2+\dots+i_q, where {i_1,i_2,\dots,i_q} are positive integers called the parts of the partition. Let \lambda>0 be an integer. The partition is said to be a \lambda--partition if i_{a+1}-i_a\geqslant \lambda for all a such that 1\leqslant a<q.   The main result of this note are combinatorial formulas, which express the quantity of 1-partitions of a given degree in terms of the \lambda--partitions of the same degree, where \lambda=2 or \lambda=3, some special parts of which are marked depending on \lambda. The presented proofs of both formulas are bijective.   It is shown that for \lambda=3 the corresponding formula is equivalent to the classical Sylvester identity.   The obtained combinatorial formulas as well as their bijective proofs are generalized to the quantities of 1--partitions, all parts of which are \geqslant k for any fixed integer k\geqslant 1.
