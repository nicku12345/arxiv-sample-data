We introduce the notion of arithmetic progression blocks or AP-blocks of \mathbb{Z}_n, which can be represented as sequences of the form (x, x+m, x+2m, ..., x+(i-1)m) \pmod n. Then we consider the problem of partitioning \mathbb{Z}_n into AP-blocks for a given difference m. We show that subject to a technical condition, the number of partitions of \mathbb{Z}_n into m-AP-blocks of a given type is independent of m. When we restrict our attention to blocks of sizes one or two, we are led to a combinatorial interpretation of a formula recently derived by Mansour and Sun as a generalization of the Kaplansky numbers. These numbers have also occurred as the coefficients in Waring's formula for symmetric functions.
