Sergey Kitaev has shown that the exponential generating function for permutations avoiding the generalized pattern \sigma-k, where \sigma is a pattern without dashes and k is one greater than the biggest element in \sigma, is determined by the exponential generating function for permutations avoiding \sigma.   We show that this also holds for permutations avoiding all the generalized patterns \sigma_1-k_1, ..., \sigma_n-k_n, where \sigma_1, ..., \sigma_n are patterns without dashes and k_i is one greater than the biggest element in \sigma_i. Similarly the exponential generating function for permutations avoiding the partially ordered generalized patterns k_1-\sigma_1-k_1, ..., k_n-\sigma_n-k_n can be determined from the exponential generating function for permutations avoiding the generalized patterns \sigma_1, ..., \sigma_n, where \sigma_1, ..., \sigma_n are patterns without dashes and k_i is one greater than the largest element in \sigma_i.   Using this we construct a bijection between bicolored set partitions and permutations avoiding the partially ordered generalized pattern 3-12-3 (that is, permutations avoiding both the patterns 3-12-4 and 4-12-3). By using this method twice, we find a closed formula for the exponential generating function for permutations avoiding the partially ordered generalized pattern 3-121-3.   Finally, we give a complete classification of when single partially ordered generalized patterns have the same set of avoiders.
