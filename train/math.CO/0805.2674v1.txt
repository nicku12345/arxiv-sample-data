Let F(x,y) be a function of two variables, and suppose y = f(x) satisfies F(x,y)=0 in some range. Then dy/dx = -Fx/Fy, where Fx and Fy denote the partial derivatives of F with respect to x and y. It is natural to seek a general expression for the higher derivatives d^ny/dx^n, in terms of partial derivatives of F, and such an expression was given in 1974 by L. Comtet and M. Fiolet. Their formula, however, contains some errors. In this note, we give a corrected expression. We give a derivation using Lagrange inversion and also an elementary proof by induction. We further correct a minor error in Comtet and Fiolet's expression for the number of terms in their formula.
