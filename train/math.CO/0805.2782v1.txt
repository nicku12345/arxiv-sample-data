We show that the shifted rank, or srank, of any partition \lambda with distinct parts equals the lowest degree of the terms appearing in the expansion of Schur's Q_{\lambda} function in terms of power sum symmetric functions. This gives an affirmative answer to a conjecture of Clifford. As pointed out by Clifford, the notion of the srank can be naturally extended to a skew partition \lambda/\mu as the minimum number of bars among the corresponding skew bar tableaux. While the srank conjecture is not valid for skew partitions, we give an algorithm to compute the srank.
