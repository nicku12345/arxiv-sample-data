Let G be a simple graph with n vertices and list chromatic number \chi_\ell(G)=\chi_\ell. Suppose that 0\leq t\leq \chi_\ell and each vertex of G is assigned a list of t colors. Albertson, Grossman and Haas [1] conjectured that at least \frac{tn}{\chi_\ell} vertices of G can be colored from these lists. In this paper we find some new results in partial list coloring which help us to show that the conjecture is true for at least half of the numbers of the set \{1,2,...,\chi_\ell(G)-1\}. In addition we introduce a new related conjecture and finally we present some results about this conjecture.
