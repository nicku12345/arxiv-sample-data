In this paper we compute the leading coefficients \mu (u,w) of the Kazhdan--Lusztig polynomials P_{u,w} for an affine Weyl group of type \tilde{B}_2. By using the \textbf{a}-function of a Coxeter group defined by Lusztig (see [L1, \S2]), we compute most \mu (u,w) explicitly. With part of these values \mu (u,w), we show that a conjecture of Lusztig on distinguished involutions is true for an affine Weyl group of type \tilde{B}_2. We also show that the conjectural formula in [L3, (12)] needs a modification.
