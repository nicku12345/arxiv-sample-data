Sturmian sequences are well-known as the ones having minimal complexity over a 2-letter alphabet. They are also the balanced sequences over a 2-letter alphabet and the sequences describing discrete lines. They are famous and have been extensively studied since the 18th century. One of the {extensions} of these sequences over a k-letter alphabet, with k\geq 3, are the episturmian sequences, which generalizes a construction of Sturmian sequences using the palindromic closure operation. There exists a finite version of the Sturmian sequences called the Christoffel words. They are known since the works of Christoffel and have interested many mathematicians. In this paper, we introduce a generalization of Christoffel words for an alphabet with 3 letters or more, using the episturmian morphisms. We call them the {\it epichristoffel words}. We define this new class of finite words and show how some of the properties of the Christoffel words can be generalized naturally or not for this class.
