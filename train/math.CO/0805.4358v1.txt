A {\em Motzkin path} of length n is a lattice path from (0,0) to (n,0) in the plane integer lattice \mathbb{Z}\times\mathbb{Z} consisting of horizontal-steps (1, 0), up-steps (1,1), and down-steps (1,-1), which never passes below the x-axis. A {\em u-segment {\rm (resp.} h-segment {\rm)}} of a Motzkin path is a maximum sequence of consecutive up-steps ({\rm resp.} horizontal-steps). The present paper studies two kinds of statistics on Motzkin paths: "number of u-segments" and "number of h-segments". The Lagrange inversion formula is utilized to represent the weighted generating function for the number of Motzkin paths according to the statistics as a sum of the partial Bell polynomials or the potential polynomials. As an application, a general framework for studying compositions are also provided.
