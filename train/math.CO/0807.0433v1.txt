Inspired by the k-inversion statistic for LLT polynomials, we define a k-inversion number and k-descent set for words. Using these, we define a new statistic on words, called the k-major index, that interpolates between the major index and inversion number. We give a bijective proof that the k-major index is equidistributed with the major index, generalizing a classical result of Foata and rediscovering a result of Kadell. Inspired by recent work of Haglund and Stevens, we give a partial extension of these definitions and constructions to standard Young tableaux. Finally, we give an application to Macdonald polynomials made possible through connections with LLT polynomials.
