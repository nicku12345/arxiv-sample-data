The purpose of this short paper is to put recent results on the symmetry of the joint distribution of the numbers of crossings and nestings of two edges over matchings, set partitions and linked partitions, in the larger context of the enumeration of increasing and decreasing chains of length 2 in fillings of moon polyominoes.
