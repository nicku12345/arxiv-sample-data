The Theorems of Hindman and van der Waerden belong to the classical theorems of partition Ramsey Theory. The Central Sets Theorem is a strong simultaneous extension of both theorems that applies to general commutative semigroups. We give a common extension of the Central Sets Theorem and Ramsey's Theorem.
