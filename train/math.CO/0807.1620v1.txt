Let {\cal{C}}_1 be the set of fundamental cycles of breadth-first-search trees in a graph G and {\cal{C}}_2 the set of the sums of two cycles in {\cal{C}}_1. Then we show that (1) {\cal{C}}={\cal{C}}_1\bigcup{\cal{C}}_2 contains a shortest \Pi-twosided cycle in a \Pi-embedded graph G;(2) \cal{C} contains all the possible shortest even cycles in a graph G;(3) If a shortest cycle in a graph G is an odd cycle, then \cal{C} contains all the shortest odd cycles in G. This implies the existence of a polynomially bounded algorithm to find a shortest \Pi-twosided cycle in an embedded graph and thus solves an open problem of B.Mohar and C.Thomassen[2,pp112]
