Chalykh, Veselov and Feigin introduced the notions of quasiinvariants for Coxeter groups, which is a generalization of invariants. In [2], Bandlow and Musiker showed that for the symmetric group S_n of order n, the space of quasiinvariants has a decomposition indexed by standard tableaux. They gave a description of basis for the components indexed by standard tableaux of shape (n-1,1). In this paper, we generalize their results to a description of basis for the components indexed by standard tableaux of arbitrary hook shape.
