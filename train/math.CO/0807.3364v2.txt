The concept of permutograph is introduced and properties of integral functions on permutographs are established. The central result characterizes the class of integral functions that are representable as lattice polynomials. This result is used to establish lattice polynomial representations of piecewise linear functions on convex domains and continuous selectors on linear orders.
