A simplicial complex \Delta is called flag if all minimal nonfaces of \Delta have at most two elements. The following are proved: First, if \Delta is a flag simplicial pseudomanifold of dimension d-1, then the graph of \Delta (i) is (2d-2)-vertex-connected and (ii) has a subgraph which is a subdivision of the graph of the d-dimensional cross-polytope. Second, the h-vector of a flag simplicial homology sphere \Delta of dimension d-1 is minimized when \Delta is the boundary complex of the d-dimensional cross-polytope.
