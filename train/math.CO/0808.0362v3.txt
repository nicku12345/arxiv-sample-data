In this paper we investigate some basic properties of fractional powers. In this regard, we show that for any rational number 1\leq {2r+1\over 2s+1}< og(G), G^{{2r+1\over 2s+1}}\longrightarrow H if and only if G\longrightarrow H^{-{2s+1\over 2r+1}}. Also, for two rational numbers {2r+1\over 2s+1} < {2p+1\over 2q+1} and a non-bipartite graph G, we show that G^{2r+1\over 2s+1} < G^{2p+1\over 2q+1}. In the sequel, we introduce an equivalent definition for circular chromatic number of graphs in terms of fractional powers. We also present a sufficient condition for equality of chromatic number and circular chromatic number.
