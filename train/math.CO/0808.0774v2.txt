The well-known Erdos-Ko-Rado Theorem states that if F is a family of k-element subsets of {1,2,...,n} (n>2k-1) such that every pair of elements in F has a nonempty intersection, then |F| is at most \binom{n-1}{k-1}. The theorem also provides necessary and sufficient conditions for attaining the maximum. We present elementary methods for deriving generalizations of the Erdos-Ko-Rado Theorem on several classes of combinatorial objects. We also extend our results to systems under Hamming intersection.
