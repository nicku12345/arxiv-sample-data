We conjecture a strong property for the up and down maps U and D in an r-differential poset: DU+tI and UD+tI have Smith normal forms over Z[t]. In particular, this would determine the integral structure of the maps U, D, UD, DU, including their ranks in any characteristic.   As evidence, we prove the conjecture for the Young-Fibonacci lattice YF studied by Okada and its r-differential generalizations Z(r), as well as verifying many of its consequences for Young's lattice Y and the r-differential Cartesian products Y^r.
