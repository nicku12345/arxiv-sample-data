Consider the following relaxation of the Hadwiger Conjecture: For each t there exists N_t such that every graph with no K_t-minor admits a vertex partition into \ceil{\alpha t+\beta} parts, such that each component of the subgraph induced by each part has at most N_t vertices. The Hadwiger Conjecture corresponds to the case \alpha=1, \beta=-1 and N_t=1. Kawarabayashi and Mohar [\emph{J. Combin. Theory Ser. B}, 2007] proved this relaxation with \alpha={31/2} and \beta=0 (and N_t a huge function of t). This paper proves this relaxation with \alpha={7/2} and \beta=-{3/2}. The main ingredients in the proof are: (1) a list colouring argument due to Kawarabayashi and Mohar, (2) a recent result of Norine and Thomas that says that every sufficiently large (t+1)-connected graph contains a K_t-minor, and (3) a new sufficient condition for a graph to have a set of edges whose contraction increases the connectivity.
