We introduce a shifted analog of the plactic monoid of Lascoux and Sch\"utzenberger, the \emph{shifted plactic monoid}. It can be defined in two different ways: via the \emph{shifted Knuth relations}, or using Haiman's mixed insertion.   Applications include: a new combinatorial derivation (and a new version of) the shifted Littlewood-Richardson Rule; similar results for the coefficients in the Schur expansion of a Schur P-function; a shifted counterpart of the Lascoux-Sch\"utzenberger theory of noncommutative Schur functions in plactic variables; a characterization of shifted tableau words; and more.
