We consider words coding exchange of three intervals with permutation (3,2,1), here called 3iet words. Recently, a characterization of substitution invariant 3iet words was provided. We study the opposite question: what are the morphisms fixing a 3iet word? We reveal a narrow connection of such morphisms and morphisms fixing Sturmian words using the new notion of amicability.
