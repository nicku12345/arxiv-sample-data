An axis parallel d-dimensional box is the Cartesian product R_1 \times R_2 \times ... \times R_d where each R_i is a closed interval on the real line. The {\it boxicity} of a graph G, denoted as \boxi(G), is the minimum integer d such that G can be represented as the intersection graph of a collection of d-dimensional boxes. An axis parallel unit cube in d-dimensional space or a d-cube is defined as the Cartesian product R_1 \times R_2 \times ... \times R_d where each R_i is a closed interval on the real line of the form [a_i,a_i + 1]. The {\it cubicity} of G, denoted as \cub(G), is the minimum integer d such that G can be represented as the intersection graph of a collection of d-cubes.   Let S(m) denote a star graph on m+1 nodes. We define {\it claw number} of a graph G as the largest positive integer k such that S(k) is an induced subgraph of G and denote it as \claw.   Let G be an AT-free graph with chromatic number \chi(G) and claw number \claw. In this paper we will show that \boxi(G) \leq \chi(G) and this bound is tight. We also show that \cub(G) \leq \boxi(G)(\ceil{\log_2 \claw} +2) \leq \chi(G)(\ceil{\log_2 \claw} +2). If G is an AT-free graph having girth at least 5 then \boxi(G) \leq 2 and therefore \cub(G) \leq 2\ceil{\log_2 \claw} +4.
