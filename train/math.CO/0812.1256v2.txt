We prove a q-analog of the following result due to McKay, Morse and Wilf: the probability that a random standard Young tableau of size n contains a fixed standard Young tableau of shape \lambda\vdash k tends to f^{\lambda}/k! in the large n limit, where f^{\lambda} is the number of standard Young tableaux of shape \lambda. We also consider the probability that a random pair (P,Q) of standard Young tableaux of the same shape contains a fixed pair (A,B) of standard Young tableaux.
