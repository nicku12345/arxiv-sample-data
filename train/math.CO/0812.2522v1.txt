A {\em Wakeford pairing} from S onto T is a bijection \phi : S \to T such that x\phi(x)\notin T, for every x\in S. The number of such pairings will be denoted by \mu(S,T).   Let A and  B be finite subsets of a group G with 1\notin B and |A|=|B|. Also assume that the order of every element of B is \ge |B|. Extending results due to Losonczy and Eliahou-Lecouvey, we show that \mu(B,A)\neq 0. Moreover we show that \mu(B,A)\ge \min \{\frac{||B|+1}{3},\frac{|B|(q-|B|-1)}{2q-|B|-4}\}, unless there is a\in A such that |Aa^{-1}\cap B|=|B|-1 or Aa^{-1} is a progression. In particular, either \mu(B,B) \ge \min \{\frac{||B|+1}{3},\frac{|B|(q-|B|-1)}{2q-|B|-4}\}, or for some a\in B, Ba^{-1} is a progression.
