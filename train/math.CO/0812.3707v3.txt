A simple graph G is said to be representable in a real vector space of dimension m if there is an embedding of the vertex set in the vector space such that the Euclidean distance between any two distinct vertices is one of only two distinct values a or b, with distance a if the vertices are adjacent and distance b otherwise. The Euclidean representation number of G is the smallest dimension in which G is representable. In this note, we bound the Euclidean representation number of a graph using multiplicities of the eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix. We also give an exact formula for the Euclidean representation number using the main angles of the graph.
