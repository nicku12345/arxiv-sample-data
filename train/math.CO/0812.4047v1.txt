The powers of matrices with Stirling number-coefficients are investigated. It is revealed that the elements of these matrices have a number of properties of the ordinary Stirling numbers. Moreover, "higher order" Bell, Fubini and Eulerian numbers can be defined. Hence we give a new interpretation for E. T. Bell's iterated exponential integers. In addition, it is worth to note that these numbers appear in combinatorial physics, in the problem of the normal ordering of quantum field theoretical operators.
