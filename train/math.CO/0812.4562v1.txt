Suppose a group G acts properly on a simplicial complex \Gamma. Let l be the number of G-invariant vertices and p_1, p_2, ... p_m be the sizes of the G-orbits having size greater than 1. Then \Gamma must be a subcomplex of \Lambda = \Delta^{l-1}* \partial \Delta^{p_1-1}*... * \partial \Delta^{p_m-1}. A result of Novik gives necessary conditions on the face numbers of Cohen-Macaulay subcomplexes of \Lambda. We show that these conditions are also sufficient, and thus provide a complete characterization of the face numbers of these complexes.
