A word is "crucial" with respect to a given set of "prohibited words" (or simply "prohibitions") if it avoids the prohibitions but it cannot be extended to the right by any letter of its alphabet without creating a prohibition. A "minimal crucial word" is a crucial word of the shortest length. A word W contains an "abelian k-th power" if W has a factor of the form X_1X_2...X_k where X_i is a permutation of X_1 for 2<= i <= k. When k=2 or 3, one deals with "abelian squares" and "abelian cubes", respectively.   In 2004 (arXiv:math/0205217), Evdokimov and Kitaev showed that a minimal crucial word over an n-letter alphabet A_n = {1,2,..., n} avoiding abelian squares has length 4n-7 for n >= 3. In this paper we show that a minimal crucial word over A_n avoiding abelian cubes has length 9n-13 for n >= 5, and it has length 2, 5, 11, and 20 for n=1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively. Moreover, for n >= 4 and k >= 2, we give a construction of length k^2(n-1)-k-1 of a crucial word over A_n avoiding abelian k-th powers. This construction gives the minimal length for k=2 and k=3. For k >= 4 and n >= 5, we provide a lower bound for the length of crucial words over A_n avoiding abelian k-th powers.
