We give combinatorial interpretations of several related identities associated with the names Barrucand, Strehl and Franel, including one for the Apery numbers. The combinatorial constructs employed are derangement-type card deals as introduced in a previous paper on Barrucand's identity, labeled lattice paths and, following a comment of Jeffrey Shallit, abelian words over a 3-letter alphabet.
