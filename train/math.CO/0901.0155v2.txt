The way to arrive at formula of zeta matrix for any graded posets with the finite set of minimal elements is delivered following the first reference. This is being achieved via adjacency and zeta matrix description of bipartite digraphs chains, the representatives of graded posets. The bipartite digraphs elements of such chains amalgamate to form corresponding cover relation graded poset digraphs with corresponding adjacency matrices being amalgamated throughout natural join as special adequate database operation. The colligation of reachability and connectivity with the presented description is made explicit. The special posets encoded via kodags directed acyclic graphs as cobeb posets cover relations digraphs are recognized as an example of differential posets subfamily. As on this night one reminisce anniversary of death of distinguished johann bernoulli the first this sylvester night article is to commemorate this date.
