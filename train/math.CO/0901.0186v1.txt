The hive model is a combinatorial device that may be used to determine Littlewood-Richardson coefficients and study their properties. It represents an alternative to the use of the Littlewood-Richardson rule. Here properties of hives are used to determine all possible multiplicity-free Schur function products and skew Schur function expansions. This confirms the results of Stembridge, Gutschwager, and Thomas and Yong, and sheds light on the combinatorial origin of the conditions for being multiplicity-free, as well as illustrating some of the key features and power of the hive model.
