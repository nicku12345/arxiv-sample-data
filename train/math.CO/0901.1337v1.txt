F-nomial coefficients encompass among others well-known binomial coefficients or Gaussian coefficients that count subsets of finite set and subspaces of finite vector space respectively. Here, the so called F-cobweb tiling sequences N(a) are considered. For such specific sequences a new interpretation with respect to Kwasniewski general combinatorial interpretation of F-nomial coefficients is unearhed.   Namely, for tiling sequences F = N(a) the F-nomial coefficients are equal to the number of labeled special bipartite multigraphs denoted here as a-multigraphs G(a,n,k).   An explicit relation between the number of k-colored a-multigraphs and multi N(a)-nomial coefficients is established. We also prove that the unsigned values of the first row of inversion matrix for N(a) -nomial coefficients considered here are equal to the numbers of directed acyclic a-multigraphs with n nodes.
