For given a graph H, a graphic sequence \pi=(d_1,d_2,...,d_n) is said to be potentially H-graphic if there exists a realization of \pi containing H as a subgraph. Let K_m-H be the graph obtained from K_m by removing the edges set E(H) where H is a subgraph of K_m. In this paper, we characterize potentially K_{2,5}-graphic sequences. This characterization implies a special case of a theorem due to Yin et al. [26].
