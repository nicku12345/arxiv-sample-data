It is well-known that the triangulations of the disc with n+2 vertices on its boundary are counted by the nth Catalan number C(n)=\frac{1}{n+1}{2n \choose n}. This paper deals with the generalisation of this problem to any arbitrary compact surface S with boundaries. We obtain the asymptotic number of simplicial decompositions of the surface S with n vertices on its boundary. More generally, we determine the asymptotic number of dissections of S when the faces are \delta-gons with \delta belonging to a set of admissible degrees \Delta\subseteq \{3,4,5,...\}. We also give the limit laws of certain parameters of such dissections.
