As a natural generalization of chromatic number of a graph, the circular chromatic number of graphs (or the star chromatic number) was introduced by A.Vince in 1988. Let M^t(G) denote the tth iterated Mycielski graph of G. It was conjectured by Chang, Huang and Zhu(Discrete mathematics,205(1999), 23-37) that for all n \ge t+2, \chi_c(M^t(K_n))=\chi(M^t(K_n))=n+t. In 2004, D.D.F. Liu proved the conjecture when t\ge 2, n\ge 2^{t-1}+2t-2. In this paper,we show that the result can be strengthened to the following: if t\ge 4, n\ge {11/12}2^{t-1}+2t+{1/3}, then \chi_c(M^t(K_n))=\chi(M^t(K_n)).
