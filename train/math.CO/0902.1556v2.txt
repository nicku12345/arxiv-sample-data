Let D denote a disk of unit area. We call a subset A of D perfect if it has measure 1/2 and, with respect to any axial symmetry of D, the maximal symmetric subset of A has measure 1/4. We call a curve \beta in D an yin-yang line if   \beta splits D into two congruent perfect sets,   \beta crosses each concentric circle of D twice,   \beta crosses each radius of D once.   We prove that Fermat's spiral is a unique yin-yang line in the class of smooth curves algebraic in polar coordinates.
