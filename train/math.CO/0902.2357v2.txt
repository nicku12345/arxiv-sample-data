Let \eta_i, i=1,..., n be iid Bernoulli random variables. Given a multiset \bv of n numbers v_1, ..., v_n, the \emph{concentration probability} \P_1(\bv) of \bv is defined as \P_1(\bv) := \sup_{x} \P(v_1 \eta_1+ ... v_n \eta_n=x). A classical result of Littlewood-Offord and Erd\H os from the 1940s asserts that if the v_i  are non-zero, then this probability is at most O(n^{-1/2}). Since then, many researchers obtained better bounds by assuming various restrictions on \bv.   In this paper, we give an asymptotically optimal characterization for all multisets \bv having large concentration probability. This allow us to strengthen or recover several previous results in a straightforward manner.
