We study a problem motivated by a question related to quantum-error-correcting codes. Combinatorially, it involves the following graph parameter: f(G)=\min\set{|A|+|\{x\in V\setminus A : d_A(x)\text{is odd}\}| : A\neq\emptyset}, where V is the vertex set of G and d_A(x) is the number of neighbors of x in A. We give asymptotically tight estimates of f for the random graph G_{n,p} when p is constant. Also, if f(n)=\max\set{f(G): |V(G)|=n} then we show that f(n)\leq (0.382+o(1))n.
