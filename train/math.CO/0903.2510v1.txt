We show that if \mathcal{E} is a subset of the d-dimensional vector space over a finite field \mathbbm{F}_q (d \geq 3) of cardinality |\mathcal{E}| \geq (d-1)q^{d - 1}, then the set of volumes of d-dimensional parallelepipeds determined by \mathcal{E} covers \mathbbm{F}_q. This bound is sharp up to a factor of (d-1) as taking \mathcal{E} to be a (d - 1)-hyperplane through the origin shows.
