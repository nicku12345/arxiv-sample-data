We derive the explicit formula for the inverse of zeta matrix for any graded posets with the finite set of minimal elements . The combinatorial interpretation of this result is given. For that to do special number theoretic code triangles for graded posets are proposed and apart from the present author combinatorial interpretation of F-nomial coefficients another one is proposed referring to the number of all maximal chains in the corresponding poset intervals.
