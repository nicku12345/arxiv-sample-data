For any rank r oriented matroid M, a construction is given of a "topological representation" of M by an arrangement of homotopy spheres in a simplicial complex which is homotopy equivalent to S^{r-1}. The construction is completely explicit and depends only on a choice of maximal flag in M. If M is orientable, then all Folkman-Lawrence representations of all orientations of M embed in this representation in a homotopically nice way.
