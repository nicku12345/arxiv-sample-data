In this paper, we study the interaction of an antisense RNA and its target mRNA, based on the model introduced by Alkan {\it et al.} (Alkan {\it et al.}, J. Comput. Biol., Vol:267--282, 2006). Our main results are the derivation of the partition function   \cite{Backhofen} (Chitsaz {\it et al.}, Bioinformatics, to appear, 2009), based on the concept of tight-structure and the computation of the base pairing probabilities. This paper contains the folding algorithm {\sf rip} which computes the partition function as well as the base pairing probabilities in O(N^4M^2)+O(N^2M^4) time and O(N^2M^2) space, where N,M denote the lengths of the interacting sequences.
