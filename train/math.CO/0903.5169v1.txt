Delsarte-Goethals-Seidel showed that if X is a spherical t-design with degree s satisfying t\geq 2s-2, X carries the structure of an association scheme. Also Bannai-Bannai showed that the same conclusion holds if X is an antipodal spherical t-design with degree s satisfying t=2s-3. As a generalization of these results, we prove that a union of spherical designs with a certain property carries the structure of a coherent configuration. We derive triple regularity of tight spherical 4,5,7-designs, mutually unbiased bases, linked symmetric designs with certain parameters.
