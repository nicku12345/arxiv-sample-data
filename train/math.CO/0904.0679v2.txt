A rational polytope is the convex hull of a finite set of points in \R^d with rational coordinates. Given a rational polytope P \subseteq \R^d, Ehrhart proved that, for t\in\Z_{\ge 0}, the function #(tP \cap \Z^d) agrees with a quasi-polynomial L_P(t), called the Ehrhart quasi-polynomial. The Ehrhart quasi-polynomial can be regarded as a discrete version of the volume of a polytope. We use that analogy to derive a new proof of Ehrhart's theorem. This proof also allows us to quickly prove two other facts about Ehrhart quasi-polynomials: McMullen's theorem about the periodicity of the individual coefficients of the quasi-polynomial and the Ehrhart-Macdonald theorem on reciprocity.
