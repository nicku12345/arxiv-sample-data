Like the Coxeter graph became reattached into the Klein graph in [2], the Levi graphs of the 9_3 and 10_3 self-dual configurations, known as the Pappus and Desargues (k-transitive) graphs \mathcal P and \mathcal D (where k=3), also admit reattachments of the distance-(k-1) graphs of half of their oriented shortest cycles via orientation assignments on their common (k-1)-arcs, concurrent for {\mathcal P} and opposite for \mathcal D, now into 2 disjoint copies of their corresponding Menger graphs. Here, \mathcal P is the unique cubic distance-transitive (or CDT) graph with the concurrent-reattachment behavior while \mathcal D is one of 7 CDT graphs with the opposite-reattachment behavior, that include the Coxeter graph. Thus, \mathcal P and \mathcal D confront each other in these respects, obtained via \mathcal C-ultrahomogeneous graph techniques [3,4] that allow to characterize the obtained reattachment Menger graphs in the same terms.
