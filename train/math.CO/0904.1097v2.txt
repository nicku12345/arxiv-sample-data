In this article, we investigate bijections on various classes of set partitions of classical types that preserve openers and closers. On the one hand we present bijections that interchange crossings and nestings. For types B and C, they generalize a construction by Kasraoui and Zeng for type A, whereas for type D, we were only able to construct a bijection between non-crossing and non-nesting set partitions. On the other hand we generalize a bijection to type B and C that interchanges the cardinality of the maximal crossing with the cardinality of the maximal nesting, as given by Chen, Deng, Du, Stanley and Yan for type A. Using a variant of this bijection, we also settle a conjecture by Soll and Welker concerning generalized type B triangulations and symmetric fans of Dyck paths.
