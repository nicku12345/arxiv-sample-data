In this paper, we investigate circular chromatic number of Mycielski construction of graphs. It was shown in \cite{MR2279672} that t^{{\rm th}} Mycielskian of the Kneser graph KG(m,n) has the same circular chromatic number and chromatic number provided that m+t is an even integer. We prove that if m is large enough, then \chi(M^t(KG(m,n)))=\chi_c(M^t(KG(m,n))) where M^t is t^{{\rm th}} Mycielskian. Also, we consider the generalized Kneser graph KG(m,n,s) and show that there exists a threshold m(n,s,t) such that \chi(M^t(KG(m,n,s)))=\chi_c(M^t(KG(m,n,s))) for m\geq m(n,s,t).
