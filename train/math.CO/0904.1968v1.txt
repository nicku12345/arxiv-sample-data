New criteria for which Cayley graphs of cyclic groups of any order can be completely determined--up to isomorphism--by the eigenvalues of their adjacency matrices is presented. Secondly, a new construction for pairs of nonisomorphic Cayley graphs of cyclic groups with the same list of eigenvalues of their adjacency matrices will be presented.
