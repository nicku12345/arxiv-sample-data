We say that two finite words u and v are abelian equivalent if and only if they have the same number of occurrences of each letter, or equivalently if they define the same Parikh vector. In this paper we investigate various abelian properties of words including abelian complexity, and abelian powers. We study the abelian complexity of the Thue-Morse word and the Tribonacci word, and answer an old question of G. Rauzy by exhibiting a class of words whose abelian complexity is everywhere equal to 3. We also investigate abelian repetitions in words and show that any infinite word with bounded abelian complexity contains abelian k-powers for every positive integer k.
