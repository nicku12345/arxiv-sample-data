This paper gives a concise overview of evolutionary algorithms for multiobjective optimization. A substantial number of evolutionary computation methods for multiobjective problem solving has been proposed so far, and an attempt of unifying existing approaches is here presented. Based on a fine-grained decomposition and following the main issues of fitness assignment, diversity preservation and elitism, a conceptual global model is proposed and is validated by regarding a number of state-of-the-art algorithms as simple variants of the same structure. The presented model is then incorporated into a general-purpose software framework dedicated to the design and the implementation of evolutionary multiobjective optimization techniques: ParadisEO-MOEO. This package has proven its validity and flexibility by enabling the resolution of many real-world and hard multiobjective optimization problems.
