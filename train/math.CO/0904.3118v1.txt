It is well-known that Catalan numbers C_n = \frac{1}{n+1} \binom{2n}{n} count the number of dominant regions in the Shi arrangement of type A, and that they also count partitions which are both n-cores as well as (n+1)-cores. These concepts have natural extensions, which we call here the m-Catalan numbers and m-Shi arrangement. In this paper, we construct a bijection between dominant regions of the m-Shi arrangement and partitions which are both n-cores as well as (mn+1)-cores. The bijection is natural in the sense that it commutes with the action of the affine symmetric group.
