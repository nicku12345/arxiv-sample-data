The type C_n full root polytope is the convex hull in R^n of the origin and the points e_i-e_j, e_i+e_j, 2e_k for 1 <= i < j <= n, k \in [n]. Given a graph G, with edges labeled positive or negative, associate to each edge e of G a vector v(e) which is e_i-e_j if e=(i, j), i < j, is labeled negative and e_i+e_j if it is labeled positive. For such a signed graph G, the associated root polytope P(G) is the intersection of the full root polytope with the cone generated by the vectors v(e), for edges e in G. The reduced forms of a certain monomial m[G] in commuting variables x_{ij}, y_{ij}, z_k under reductions derived from the relations of a bracket algebra of type C_n, can be interpreted as triangulations of P(G). Using these triangulations, the volume of P(G) can be calculated. If we allow variables to commute only when all their indices are distinct, then we prove that the reduced form of m[G], for "good" graphs G, is unique and yields a canonical triangulation of P(G) in which each simplex corresponds to a noncrossing alternating graph in a type C sense. A special case of our results proves a conjecture of A. N. Kirillov about the uniqueness of the reduced form of a Coxeter type element in the bracket algebra of type C_n. We also study the bracket algebra of type D_n and show that a family of monomials has unique reduced forms in it. A special case of our results proves a conjecture of A. N. Kirillov about the uniqueness of the reduced form of a Coxeter type element in the bracket algebra of type D_n.
