Nonstandard graphs have been defined and examined in prior works. The present work does the same for nonstandard digraphs. Since digraphs have more structure than do graphs, the present discussion requires more complicated definitions and yields a variety of results peculiar to nonstandard digraphs. A nonstandard digraph can be obtained by means of an ultrapower construction based on a sequence of digraphs or more elegantly by using the transfer principle. We use either or both techniques in particular circumstances. As special cases, we have the enlargement of a single infinite digraph and also hyperfinite digraphs based on sequences of finite digraphs. Also examined are such ideas as incidences and adjacencies for nonstandard arcs and vertices, connectedness, components, and galaxies in nonstandard digraphs.
