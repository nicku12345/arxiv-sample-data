It was shown in that harmonic numbers satisfy certain reciprocity relations, which are in particular useful for the analysis of the quickselect algorithm. The aim of this work is to show that a reciprocity relation from \cite{KirProd98,ProSchnKu} can be generalized to finite variants of multiple zeta values, involving a finite variant of the shuffle identity for multiple zeta values. We present the generalized reciprocity relation and furthermore a simple elementary proof of the shuffle identity using only partial fraction decomposition. We also present an extension of the reciprocity relation to weighted sums.
