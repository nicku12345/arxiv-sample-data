Let M_n be an n by n random matrix where each entry is +1 or -1 independently with probability 1/2. Our main result implies that the probability that M_n is singular is at most (1/\sqrt{2} + o(1))^n, improving on the previous best upper bound of (3/4 + o(1))^n proven by Tao and Vu in arXiv:math/0501313v2. This paper follows a similar approach to the Tao and Vu result, including using a variant of their structure theorem. We also extend this type of exponential upper bound on the probability that a random matrix is singular to a large class of discrete random matrices taking values in the complex numbers, where the entries are independent but are not necessarily identically distributed.
