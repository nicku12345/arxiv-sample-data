For each positive integer n \geq 4, we give an inequality satisfied by rank functions of arrangements of n subspaces. When n=4 we recover Ingleton's inequality; for higher n the inequalities are all new. These inequalities can be thought of as a hierarchy of necessary conditions for a (poly)matroid to be realizable. Some related open questions about the "cone of realizable polymatroids" are also presented.
