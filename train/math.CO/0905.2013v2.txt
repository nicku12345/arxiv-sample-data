We prove a formula for the number of permutations in S_n such that their first n-k entries are increasing and their longest increasing subsequence has length n-k. This formula first appeared as a consequence of character polynomial calculations in recent work of Adriano Garsia and Alain Goupil. We give two `elementary' bijective proofs of this result and of its q-analogue, one proof using the RSK correspondence and one only permutations.
