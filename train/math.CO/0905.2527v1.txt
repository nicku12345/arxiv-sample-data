Polynomial algorithms are given for the following two problems: given a graph with n vertices and m edges, where m \ge 3 n^{3/2}, find a complete balanced bipartite subgraph with parts about \ln n/(\ln (n^2/m)), given a graph with n vertices, find a decomposition of its edges into complete balanced bipartite graphs having altogether O(n^2 / \ln n) vertices. Previous proofs of the existence of such objects, due to K\H{o}v\'ari-S\'os-Tur\'an, Chung-Erd\H{o}s-Spencer, Bublitz and Tuza were non-constructive.
