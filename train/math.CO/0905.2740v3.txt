A pseudo (v,\, k,\, \la)-design is a pair (X, {\cal B}) where X is a v-set and {\cal B}=\{B_1,...,B_{v-1}\} is a collection of k-subsets (blocks) of X such that each two distinct B_i, B_j intersect in \la elements; and 0\le\la <k \le v-1. We use the notion of pseudo designs to characterize graphs of order n whose (adjacency) spectrum contains a zero and \pm\theta with multiplicity (n-3)/2 where 0<\theta\le\sqrt{2}. Meanwhile, partial results confirming a conjecture of O. Marrero on characterization of pseudo (v,\, k,\, \la)-designs are obtained.
