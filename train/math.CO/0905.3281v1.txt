Let G be a simple graph of order n. The domination polynomial of G is the polynomial D(G,x)=\sum_{i=\gamma(G)}^{n} d(G,i) x^{i}, where d(G,i) is the number of dominating sets of G of size i, and \gamma(G) is the domination number of G. In this paper we study the domination polynomials of cubic graphs of order 10. As a consequence, we show that the Petersen graph is determined uniquely by its domination polynomial.
