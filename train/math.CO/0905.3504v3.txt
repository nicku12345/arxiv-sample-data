Eberhard proved that for every sequence (p_k), 3\le k\le r, k\ne 5,7 of non-negative integers satisfying Euler's formula \sum_{k\ge3} (6-k) p_k = 12, there are infinitely many values p_6 such that there exists a simple convex polyhedron having precisely p_k faces of length k for every k\ge3, where p_k=0 if k>r. In this paper we prove a similar statement when non-negative integers p_k are given for 3\le k\le r, except for k=5 and k=7. We prove that there are infinitely many values p_5,p_7 such that there exists a simple convex polyhedron having precisely p_k faces of length k for every k\ge3. %, where p_k=0 if k>r. We derive an extension to arbitrary closed surfaces, yielding maps of arbitrarily high face-width. Our proof suggests a general method for obtaining results of this kind.
