Let p be a prime and let r, e, m be positive integers such that r|e and e|m. The enumeration of linear codes of length p^m over {\Bbb F}_{p^r} which are invariant under the affine linear group {\rm AGL}(\frac me, {\Bbb F}_{p^e}) is equivalent to the enumeration of certain ideals in a partially ordered set ({\mathcal U}, \prec) where {\mathcal U}=\{0,1,...,\frac me(p-1)\}^e and \prec is defined by an e-dimensional simplicial cone. When e=2, the enumeration problem was solved in an earlier paper. In the present paper, we consider the cases e=3. We describe methods for enumerating all {\rm AGL}(\frac m3, {\Bbb F}_{p^3})-invariant linear codes of length p^m over {\Bbb F}_{p^r}
