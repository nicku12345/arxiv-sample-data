We point out that the total number of trails and the total number of paths of given length, between two vertices of a simple undirected graph, are obtained as expectation values of specifically engineered quantum mechanical observables. Such observables are contextual with some background independent theories of gravity and emergent geometry. Thus, we point out yet another situation in which the mathematical formalism of a physical theory has some computational aspects involving intractable problems.
