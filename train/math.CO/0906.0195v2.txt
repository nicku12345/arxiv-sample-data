We have the Fisher type inequality and the linear programming bound as upper bounds for the cardinalities of s-distance sets on S^{d-1}. In this paper, we give a new upper bound for the cardinalities of s-distance sets on S^{d-1} for any s. This upper bound improves the Fisher typer inequality and is useful for s-distance sets which are not applicable to the linear programming bound.
