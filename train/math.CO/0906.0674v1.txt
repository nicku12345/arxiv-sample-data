In 1976, P. R. Scott characterized the Ehrhart polynomials of convex integral polygons. We study the same question for Ehrhart polynomials and quasi-polynomials of \emph{non}-integral convex polygons. Define a \emph{pseudo-integral polygon}, or \emph{PIP}, to be a convex rational polygon whose Ehrhart quasi-polynomial is a polynomial. The numbers of lattice points on the interior and on the boundary of a PIP determine its Ehrhart polynomial. We show that, unlike the integral case, there exist PIPs with b=1 or b=2 boundary points and an arbitrary number I \ge 1 of interior points. However, the question of whether a PIP must satisfy Scott's inequality b \le 2I + 7 when I \ge 1 remains open. Turning to the case in which the Ehrhart quasi-polynomial has nontrivial quasi-period, we determine the possible minimal periods that the coefficient functions of the Ehrhart quasi-polynomial of a rational polygon may have.
