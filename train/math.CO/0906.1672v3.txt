A permutation can be locally classified according to the four local types called peaks, valleys, double rises and double falls, and there is a corresponding classification of binary increasing trees according to four node types. By a bijection between permutations, binary increasing trees, and suitably defined path diagrams induced by Motzkin paths, Flajolet [Flajo1980] obtained a continued fraction representation of the generating function of local types. The aim of this article is to extend the notion of local types to k-Stirling permutations, establish a bijection of these local types to node types of (k+1)-ary increasing trees, and to obtain a continued fraction type representation of the generating function of these local types through a bijection with suitably defined path diagrams, generalizing the corresponding result of [Flajo1980]. In the case of the classical Stirling permutations, we give an alternative continued fraction type representation of the generating function, by using the correspondence between Stirling permutations, plane-oriented recursive trees, and a different family of path diagrams.
