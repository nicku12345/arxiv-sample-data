An edge colouring of a multigraph can be thought of as a partition of the edges into matchings (a matching meets each vertex at most once). Analogously, an edge cover colouring is a partition of the edges into edge covers (an edge cover meets each vertex at least once). We aim to determine a tight lower bound on the maximum number of parts in an edge cover colouring as a function of the minimum degree delta, which would be an analogue of Shannon's theorem from 1949 on edge-colouring multigraphs. We are able to give a lower bound that is tight except when delta=9 or delta is odd and > 12; in these non-tight cases the best upper and lower bounds differ by one.
