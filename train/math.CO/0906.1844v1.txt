In this paper, we study symmetric lattice paths. Let d_{n}, m_{n}, and s_{n} denote the number of symmetric Dyck paths, symmetric Motzkin paths, and symmetric Schr\"oder paths of length 2n, respectively. By using Riordan group methods we obtain six identities relating d_{n}, m_{n}, and s_{n} and also give two of them combinatorial proofs. Finally, we investigate some relations satisfied by the generic element of some special Riordan arrays and get the average mid-height and the average number of points on the x-axis of symmetric Dyck paths of length 2n.
