The Bailey lemma is a famous tool to prove Rogers-Ramanujan type identities. We use shifted versions of the Bailey lemma to derive m-versions of multisum Rogers-Ramanujan type identities. We also apply this method to the Well-Poised Bailey lemma and obtain a new extension of the Rogers-Ramanujan identities.
