Various sequences that possess explicit analytic expressions can be analysed asymptotically through integral representations due to Lindel\"of, which belong to an attractive but somewhat neglected chapter of complex analysis. One of the outcomes of such analyses concerns the non-existence of linear recurrences with polynomial coefficients annihilating these sequences, and, accordingly, the non-existence of linear differential equations with polynomial coefficients annihilating their generating functions. In particular, the corresponding generating functions are transcendental. Asymptotic estimates of certain finite difference sequences come out as a byproduct of the Lindel\"of approach.
