The properties of eigenvalues of large dimensional random matrices have received considerable attention. One important achievement is the existence and identification of the limiting spectral distribution of the empirical spectral distribution of eigenvalues of Wigner matrix. In the present paper, we explore the limiting spectral distribution for more general random matrices, and, furthermore, give an application to the energy of general random graphs, which generalizes the result of Nikiforov.
