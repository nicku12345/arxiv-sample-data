The recent paper "Linear Connectivity Forces Large Complete Bipartite Minors" by Boehme et al. relies on a structure theorem for graphs with no H-minor. The sketch provided of how to deduce this theorem from the work of Robertson and Seymour appears to be incomplete. To fill this gap, we modify the main proof of that paper to work with a mere restatement of Robertson and Seymour's original results instead.
