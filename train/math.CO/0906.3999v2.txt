In this paper we study abstract shapes of k-noncrossing, \sigma-canonical RNA pseudoknot structures. We consider {\sf lv}_k^{\sf 1}- and {\sf lv}_k^{\sf 5}-shapes, which represent a generalization of the abstract \pi'- and \pi-shapes of RNA secondary structures introduced by \citet{Giegerich:04ashape}. Using a novel approach we compute the generating functions of {\sf lv}_k^{\sf 1}- and {\sf lv}_k^{\sf 5}-shapes as well as the generating functions of all {\sf lv}_k^{\sf 1}- and {\sf lv}_k^{\sf 5}-shapes induced by all k-noncrossing, \sigma-canonical RNA structures for fixed n. By means of singularity analysis of the generating functions, we derive explicit asymptotic expressions.
