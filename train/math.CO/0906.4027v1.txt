It is well known that a tournament (complete oriented graph) on n vertices has at most {1/4}\binom{n}{3} directed triangles, and that the constant 1/4 is best possible. Motivated by some geometric considerations, our aim in this paper is to consider some `higher order' versions of this statement. For example, if we give each 3-set from an n-set a cyclic ordering, then what is the greatest number of `directed 4-sets' we can have? We give an asymptotically best possible answer to this question, and give bounds in the general case when we orient each d-set from an n-set.
