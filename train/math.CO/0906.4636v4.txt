Gutman {\it et al.} introduced the concepts of energy \En(G) and Laplacian energy \EnL(G) for a simple graph G, and furthermore, they proposed a conjecture that for every graph G, \En(G) is not more than \EnL(G). Unfortunately, the conjecture turns out to be incorrect since Liu {\it et al.} and Stevanovi\'c {\it et al.} constructed counterexamples. However, So {\it et al.} verified the conjecture for bipartite graphs. In the present paper, we obtain, for a random graph, the lower and upper bounds of the Laplacian energy, and show that the conjecture is true for almost all graphs.
