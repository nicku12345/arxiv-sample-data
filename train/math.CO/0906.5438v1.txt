Resorting to the recursions satisfied by the polynomials which converge to the right hand sides of the Rogers-Ramanujan type identities given by Sills and a determinant method presented in a paper by Ismail-Prodinger-Stanton, we obtain many new one-parameter generalizations of the Rogers-Ramanujan type identities, such as a generalization of the analytic versions of the first and second G\"{o}llnitz-Gordon partition identities, and generalizations of the first, second, and third Rogers-Selberg identities.
