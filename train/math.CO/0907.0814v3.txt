Let V be a complex vector space with basis {x_1,x_2,...,x_n} and G be a finite subgroup of GL(V). The tensor algebra T(V) over the complex is isomorphic to the polynomials in the non-commutative variables x_1, x_2,..., x_n with complex coefficients. We want to give a combinatorial interpretation for the decomposition of T(V) into simple G-modules. In particular, we want to study the graded space of invariants in T(V) with respect to the action of G. We give a general method for decomposing the space T(V) into simple modules in terms of words in a Cayley graph of the group G. To apply the method to a particular group, we require a homomorphism from a subalgebra of the group algebra into the character algebra. In the case of G as the symmetric group, we give an example of this homomorphism from the descent algebra. When G is the dihedral group, we have a realization of the character algebra as a subalgebra of the group algebra. In those two cases, we have an interpretation for the graded dimensions of the invariant space in term of those words.
