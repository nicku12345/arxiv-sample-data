A latin bitrade (T1, T2) is a pair of partial latin squares which are disjoint, occupy the same set of non-empty cells, and whose corresponding rows and columns contain the same set of entries. A genus may be associated to a latin bitrade by constructing an embedding of the underlying graph in an oriented surface. We report computational enumeration results on the number of spherical (genus 0) latin bitrades up to size 24.
