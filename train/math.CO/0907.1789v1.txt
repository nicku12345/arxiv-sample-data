Let T = (T^{\textstyle \ast}, T^{\scriptscriptstyle \triangle}) be a spherical latin bitrade. With each a=(a_1,a_2,a_3)\in T^{\textstyle \ast} associate a set of linear equations \eq(T,a) of the form b_1+b_2=b_3, where b = (b_1,b_2,b_3) runs through T^{\textstyle \ast} \setminus \{a\}. Assume a_1 = 0 = a_2 and a_3 = 1. Then \eq(T,a) has in rational numbers a unique solution b_i = \bar b_i. Suppose that \bar b_i \ne \bar c_i for all b,c \in T^{\textstyle \ast} such that b_i \ne c_i and i \in \{1,2,3\}. We prove that then T^{\scriptscriptstyle \triangle} can be interpreted as a dissection of an equilateral triangle. We also consider group modifications of latin bitrades and show that the methods for generating the dissections can be used for a proof that T^{\textstyle \ast} can be embedded into the operational table of a finite abelian group, for every spherical latin bitrade T.
