Let G be a graph, C a longest cycle in G and \overline{p}, \overline{c} the lengths of a longest path and a longest cycle in G\backslash C, respectively. Almost all lower bounds for the circumference base on a standard procedure: choose an initial cycle C_0 in G and try to enlarge it via structures of G\backslash C_0 and connections between C_0 and G\backslash C_0 closely related to \overline{p}, \overline{c} and connectivity \kappa. Actually, each lower bound obtained in result of this procedure, somehow or is related to \kappa, \overline{p}, \overline{c} but in forms of various particular values of \kappa, \overline{p}, \overline{c} and the major problem is to involve these invariants into such bounds as parameters. In this paper we present a lower bound for the circumference involving \delta, \kappa and \overline{c} and increasing with \delta, \kappa and \overline{c}.
