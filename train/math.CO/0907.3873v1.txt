A binary partition of a positive integer n is a partition of n in which each part has size a power of two. In this note we first construct a Gray sequence on the set of binary partitions of n. This is an ordering of the set of binary partitions of each n (or of all n) such that adjacent partitions differ by one of a small set of elementary transformations; here the allowed transformatios are replacing 2^k+2^k by 2^{k+1} or vice versa (or addition of a new +1). Next we give a purely local condition for finding the successor of any partition in this sequence; the rule is so simple that successive transitions can be performed in constant time. Finally we show how to compute directly the bijection between k and the kth term in the sequence.   This answers a question posed by Donald Knuth in section 7.2.1 of The Art of Computer Programming.
