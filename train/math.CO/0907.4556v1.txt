Let \mathcal{Q}_1 and \mathcal{Q}_2 be two arbitrary quadrics with no common hyperplane in {\mathbb{P}}^n(\mathbb{F}_q). We give the best upper bound for the number of points in the intersection of these two quadrics. Our result states that | \mathcal{Q}_1\cap \mathcal{Q}_2|\le 4q^{n-2}+\pi_{n-3}. This result inspires us to establish the conjecture on the number of points of an algebraic set X\subset {\mathbb{P}}^n(\mathbb{F}_q) of dimension s and degree d: |X(\mathbb{F}_q)|\le dq^s+\pi_{s-1}.
