We prove a generalization of Graham's Conjecture for optimal pebbling with arbitrary sets of target distributions. We provide bounds on optimal pebbling numbers of products of complete graphs and explicitly find optimal t-pebbling numbers for specific such products. We obtain bounds on optimal pebbling numbers of powers of the cycle C_5. Finally, we present explicit distributions which provide asymptotic bounds on optimal pebbling numbers of hypercubes.
