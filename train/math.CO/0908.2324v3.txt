We give a short proof of Cayley's tree formula for counting the number of different labeled trees on n vertices. The following nonlinear recursive relation for the number of labeled trees on n vertices is deduced from a combinatorial argument,  T_n = \frac{n}{2} \sum_{k=0}^{n-2} \left ( \begin {array} {c} n-2 \\ k \end {array} \right ) T_{k+1} T_{n-k-1}; \ \ for \ n > 1 \ and \ T_1 = 1,  and then it is proved that T_n = n^{n-2}, which gives yet another proof of the celebrated Cayley's tree formula.
