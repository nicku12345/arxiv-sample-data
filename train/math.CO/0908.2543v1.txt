A dynamic coloring of a graph G is a proper coloring such that for every vertex v\in V(G) of degree at least 2, the neighbors of v receive at least 2 colors. In this paper we present some upper bounds for the dynamic chromatic number of graphs. In this regard, we shall show that there is a constant c such that for every k-regular graph G, \chi_d(G)\leq \chi(G)+ c\ln k +1. Also, we introduce an upper bound for the dynamic list chromatic number of regular graphs.
