We give combinatorial proofs of the formulas for the number of multichains in the k-divisible noncrossing partitions of classical types with certain conditions on the rank and the block size due to Krattenthaler and M{\"u}ller. We also prove Armstrong's conjecture on the zeta polynomial of the poset of k-divisible noncrossing partitions of type A invariant under a 180^\circ rotation in the cyclic representation.
