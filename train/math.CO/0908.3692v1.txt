The notion of (k,m)-agreeable society was introduced by Deborah Berg et al.: a family of convex subsets of \R^d is called (k,m)-agreeable if any subfamily of size m contains at least one non-empty k-fold intersection. In that paper, the (k,m)-agreeability of a convex family was shown to imply the existence of a subfamily of size \beta n with non-empty intersection, where n is the size of the original family and \beta\in[0,1] is an explicit constant depending only on k,m and d. The quantity \beta(k,m,d) is called the minimal \emph{agreement proportion} for a (k,m)-agreeable family in \R^d.   If we only assume that the sets are convex, simple examples show that \beta=0 for (k,m)-agreeable families in \R^d where k<d. In this paper, we introduce new techniques to find positive lower bounds when restricting our attention to families of d-boxes, i.e. cuboids with sides parallel to the coordinates hyperplanes. We derive explicit formulas for the first non-trivial case: the case of (2,3)-agreeable families of d-boxes with d\geq 2.
