Sprouts is a two-player topological game, invented in 1967 by Michael Paterson and John Conway. The game starts with p spots, lasts at most 3p-1 moves, and the player who makes the last move wins. In the misere version of Sprouts, on the contrary, the player who makes the last move loses. Sprouts is a very intricate game, and the first computer analysis in 1991 reached only p=11. New results were made possible in 2007 up to p=32 by using combinatorial game theory: when a position is a sum of independant games, it is possible to replace some of these games by a natural number, called the nimber, without changing the winning or losing outcome of the complete position. However, this reduction does not apply to the misere version, making the analysis of Sprouts (and more generally of any game) more difficult in the misere version. In 1991, only p=9 was reached in misere Sprouts, and we describe in this paper how we obtained up to p=17. First, we describe a theoretical tool, the reduced canonical tree, which plays a role similar to the nimber in the normal version. Then, we describe the way we have implemented it in our program, and detail the results it allowed us to obtain on misere Sprouts.
