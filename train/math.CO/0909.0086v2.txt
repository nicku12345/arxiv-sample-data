We generalize multivariate hook product formulae for P-partitions. We use Macdonald symmetric functions to prove a (q,t)-deformation of Gansner's hook product formula for the generating functions of reverse (shifted) plane partitions. (The unshifted case has also been proved by Adachi.) For a d-complete poset, we present a conjectural (q,t)-deformation of Peterson--Proctor's hook product formula.
