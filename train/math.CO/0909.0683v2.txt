We prove bijectively that the total number of cycles of all even permutations of [n]=\{1,2,...,n\} and the total number of cycles of all odd permutations of [n] differ by (-1)^n(n-2)!, which was stated as an open problem by Mikl\'{o}s B\'{o}na. We also prove bijectively the following more general identity: \sum_{i=1}^n c(n,i)\cdot i \cdot (-k)^{i-1} = (-1)^k k! (n-k-1)!, where c(n,i) denotes the number of permutations of [n] with i cycles.
