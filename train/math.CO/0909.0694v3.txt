We present examples of flag homology spheres whose \gamma-vectors satisfy the Kruskal-Katona inequalities. This includes several families of well-studied simplicial complexes, including Coxeter complexes and the simplicial complexes dual to the associahedron and to the cyclohedron. In these cases, we construct explicit simplicial complexes whose f-vectors are the \gamma-vectors in question. In another direction, we show that if a flag (d-1)-sphere has at most 2d+2 vertices its \gamma-vector satisfies the Kruskal-Katona inequalities. We conjecture that if \Delta is a flag homology sphere then \gamma(\Delta) satisfies the Kruskal-Katona inequalities. This conjecture is a significant refinement of Gal's conjecture, which asserts that such \gamma-vectors are nonnegative.
