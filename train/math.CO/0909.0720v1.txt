In this paper, we study k-parabolic arrangements, a generalization of k-equal arrangements for finite real reflection groups. When k=2, these arrangements correspond to the well-studied Coxeter arrangements. Brieskorn (1971) showed that the fundamental group of the complement, over \mathbb{C}, of the type W Coxeter arrangement is isomorphic to the pure Artin group of type W. Khovanov (1996) gave an algebraic description for the fundamental group of the complement, over \mathbb{R}, of the 3-equal arrangement. We generalize Khovanov's result to obtain an algebraic description of the fundamental groups of the complements of 3-parabolic arrangements for arbitrary finite reflection groups. Our description is a real analogue to Brieskorn's description.
