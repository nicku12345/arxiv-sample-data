Let P(M) be the matroid base polytope of a matroid M. A {\em matroid base polytope decomposition} of P(M) is a decomposition of the form P(M) = \bigcup\limits_{i=1}^t P(M_{i}) where each P(M_i) is also a matroid base polytope for some matroid M_i, and for each 1\le i \neq j\le t, the intersection P(M_{i}) \cap P(M_{j}) is a face of both P(M_i) and P(M_j). In this paper, we investigate {\em hyperplane splits}, that is, polytope decompositions when t=2. We give sufficient conditions for M so P(M) has a hyperplane split and characterize when P(M_1 \oplus M_2) has a hyperplane split where M_1 \oplus M_2 denote the {\em direct sum} of matroids M_1 and M_2. We also prove that P(M) has not a hyperplane split if M is binary. Finally, we show that P(M) has not a decomposition if its 1-skeleton is the {\em hypercube}.
