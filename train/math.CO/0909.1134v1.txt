A common generalization of two theorems on the face numbers of Cohen-Macaulay (CM, for short) simplicial complexes is established: the first is the theorem of Stanley (necessity) and Bjorner-Frankl-Stanley (sufficiency) that characterizes all possible face numbers of a-balanced CM complexes, while the second is the theorem of Novik (necessity) and Browder (sufficiency) that characterizes the face numbers of CM subcomplexes of the join of the boundaries of simplices.
