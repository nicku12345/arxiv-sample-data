Let G be a connected graph, and let \lambda_1 and \rho denote the spectral radius of G and the universal cover of G, respectively. In \cite{Fri03}, Friedman has shown that almost every n-lift of G has all of its new eigenvalues bounded by O(\lambda_1^{1/2}\rho^{1/2}). In \cite{LP10}, Linial and Puder have improved this bound to O(\lambda_1^{1/3}\rho^{2/3}). Friedman had conjectured that this bound can actually be improved to \rho + o_n(1) (e.g., see \cite{Fri03,HLW06}).   In \cite{LP10}, Linial and Puder have formulated two new categorizations of formal words, namely \phi and \beta, which assign a non-negative integer or infinity to each word. They have shown that for every word w, \phi(w) = 0 iff \beta(w) = 0, and \phi(w) = 1 iff \beta(w) = 1. They have conjectured that \phi(w) = \beta(w) for every word w, and have run extensive numerical simulations that strongly suggest that this conjecture is true. This conjecture, if proven true, gives us a very promising approach to proving a slightly weaker version of Friedman's conjecture, namely the bound O(\rho) on the new eigenvalues (see \cite{LP10}).   In this paper, we make further progress towards proving this important conjecture by showing that \phi(w) = 2 iff \beta(w) = 2 for every word w.
