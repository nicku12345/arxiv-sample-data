We (1) determine the number of Latin rectangles with 11 columns and each possible number of rows, including the Latin squares of order~11, (2) answer some questions of Alter by showing that the number of reduced Latin squares of order n is divisible by f! where f is a particular integer close to \frac12n, (3) provide a formula for the number of Latin squares in terms of permanents of (+1,-1)-matrices, (4) find the extremal values for the number of 1-factorisations of k-regular bipartite graphs on 2n vertices whenever 1\leq k\leq n\leq11, (5) show that the proportion of Latin squares with a non-trivial symmetry group tends quickly to zero as the order increases.
