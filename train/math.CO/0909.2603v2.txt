In this paper, we simplify the known switching theorem due to Bose and Shrikhande as follows.   Let G=(V,E) be a primitive strongly regular graph with parameters (v,k,\lambda,\mu).   Let S(G,H) be the graph from G by switching with respect to a nonempty H\subset V.   Suppose v=2(k-\theta_1) where \theta_1 is the nontrivial positive eigenvalue of the (0,1) adjacency matrix of G. This strongly regular graph is associated with a regular two-graph.   Then, S(G,H) is a strongly regular graph with the same parameters if and only if the subgraph induced by H is k-\frac{v-h}{2} regular. Moreover, S(G,H) is a strognly regualr graph with the other parameters if and only if the subgraph induced by H is k-\mu regular and the size of H is v/2. We prove these theorems with the view point of the geometrical theory of the finite set on the Euclidean unit sphere.
