In this paper, we will introduce an special kind of graph homomorphisms namely semi-locally-surjective graph homomorphisms and show some relations between semi-locally-surjective graph homomorphisms and colorful colorings of graphs and then we prove that for each natural number k, the Kneser graph KG(2k+1,k) is b-continuous. Finally, we introduce some special conditions for graphs to be b-continuous.
