We define a new lattice structure on the elements of a finite Coxeter group W. This lattice, called the shard intersection order, is weaker than the weak order and has the noncrossing partition lattice NC(W) as a sublattice. The new construction of NC(W) yields a new proof that NC(W) is a lattice. The shard intersection order is graded and its rank generating function is the W-Eulerian polynomial. Many order-theoretic properties of the shard intersection order, like Mobius number, number of maximal chains, etc., are exactly analogous to the corresponding properties of NC(W). There is a natural dimension-preserving bijection between simplices in the order complex of the shard intersection order (i.e. chains in the shard intersection order) and simplices in a certain pulling triangulation of the W-permutohedron. Restricting the bijection to the order complex of NC(W) yields a bijection to simplices in a pulling triangulation of the W-associahedron.   The shard intersection order is defined indirectly via the polyhedral geometry of the reflecting hyperplanes of W. Indeed, most of the results of the paper are proven in the more general setting of simplicial hyperplane arrangements.
