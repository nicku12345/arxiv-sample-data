We prove that the multiset {(RightArmLength,LeftArmLength)} ranging over all cells of all Ferrers diagrams with n cells equals the multiset {(RightArmLength,LegLength)} ranging over all cells of all Ferrers diagrams with n cells, thereby refining a multi-set identity proved by C. Bessenrodt and by Bacher and L. Manivel.   Added In revised version: Guo-Niu Han kindly pointed out to us that our main result is contained in reference [B.H] of the present article.
