This paper presents a bijection between ascent sequences and upper triangular matrices whose non-negative entries are such that all rows and columns contain at least one non-zero entry. We show the equivalence of several natural statistics on these structures under this bijection and prove that some of these statistics are equidistributed. Several special classes of matrices are shown to have simple formulations in terms of ascent sequences. Binary matrices are shown to correspond to ascent sequences with no two adjacent entries the same. Bidiagonal matrices are shown to be related to order-consecutive set partitions and a simple condition on the ascent sequences generate this class.
