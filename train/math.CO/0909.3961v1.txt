We give a new description of the flag major index, introduced by Adin and Roichman, by using a major index defined by Reiner. This allows us to establish a connection between an identity of Reiner and some more recent results due to Chow and Gessel. Furthermore we generalize the main identity of Chow and Gessel by computing the four-variate generating series of descents, major index, length, and number of negative entries over Coxeter groups of type B and D.
