Let \mathcal S be a subset of the positive integers, and M be a positive integer. Mohammad K. Azarian, inspired by work of Tony Colledge, considered the number of ways to climb a staircase containing n stairs using "step-sizes" s \in \mathcal S and multiplicities at most M.   In this exposition, we find a solution via generating functions, i.e., an expression which counts the number of partitions n = \sum_{s \in \mathcal S} m_s s satisfying 0 \leq m_s \leq M. We then use this result to answer a series of questions posed by Azarian, thereby showing a link with ten sequences listed in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences. We conclude by posing open questions which seek to count the number of compositions of n.
