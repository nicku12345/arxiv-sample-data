We express a weighted generalization of the Delannoy numbers in terms of shifted Jacobi polynomials. A specialization of our formulas extends a relation between the central Delannoy numbers and Legendre polynomials, observed over 50 years ago, to all Delannoy numbers and certain Jacobi polynomials. Another specialization provides a weighted lattice path enumeration model for shifted Jacobi polynomials, we use this to present a new combinatorial proof of the orthogonality of Jacobi polynomials with natural number parameters. The proof relates the orthogonality of these polynomials to the orthogonality of (generalized) Laguerre polynomials, as they arise in the theory of rook polynomials. We provide a combinatorial proof for the orthogonality of certain Romanovski-Jacobi polynomials with zero first parameter and negative integer second parameter, considered as an initial segment of the list of similarly transformed Jacobi polynomials with the same parameters. We observe that for an odd second parameter one more polynomial may be added to this finite orthogonal polynomial sequence than what was predicted by a classical result of Askey and Romanovski. The remaining transformed Jacobi polynomials in the sequence are either equal to the already listed Romanovski-Jacobi polynomials or monomial multiples of similarly transformed Jacobi polynomials with a positive second parameter. We provide expressions for an analogous weighted generalization of the Schr\"oder numbers in terms of the Jacobi polynomials, and use this model, together with a result of Mansour and Sun, to express the Narayana polynomials in terms of shifted Jacobi polynomials.
