Let \Gamma =(V,E) be a reflexive relation with a transitive automorphisms group. Let v\in V and let F be a finite subset of V with v\in F.   We prove that the size of \Gamma (F) (the image of F) is at least  |F|+ |\Gamma (v)|-|\Gamma ^- (v)\cap F|.   Let A,B be finite subsets of a group G. Applied to Cayley graphs, our result reduces to following extension of the Scherk-Kemperman Theorem, proved by Kemperman: |AB|\ge |A|+|B|-|A\cap (cB^{-1})|, for every c\in AB.
