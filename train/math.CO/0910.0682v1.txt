The notion of pseudocyclic association scheme is generalized to the non-commutative case. It is proved that any pseudocyclic scheme the rank of which is much more than the valency is the scheme of a Frobenius group and is uniquely determined up to isomorphism by its intersection number array. An immediate corollary of this result is that any scheme of prime degree, valency k and rank at least k^4 is schurian.
