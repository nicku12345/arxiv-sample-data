We determine the minimal density of triangles in a tripartite graph with prescribed edge densities. This extends a previous result of Bondy, Shen, Thomass\'e and Thomassen characterizing those edge densities guaranteeing the existence of a triangle in a tripartite graph.   To be precise we show that a suitably weighted copy of the graph formed by deleting a certain 9-cycle from K_{3,3,3} has minimal triangle density among all weighted tripartite graphs with prescribed edge densities.
