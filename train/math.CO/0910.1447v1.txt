Turan's Theorem states that every graph of a certain edge density contains a complete graph K^k and describes the unique extremal graphs. We give a similar Theorem for l-partite graphs. For large l, we find the minimal edge density d^k_l, such that every \ell-partite graph whose parts have pairwise edge density greater than d^k_l contains a K^k. It turns out that d^k_l=(k-2)/(k-1) for large enough l. We also describe the structure of the extremal graphs.   For the case of triangles we show that d^3_{13}=1/2, disproving a conjecture by Bondy, Shen, Thomasse and Thomassen.
