In \cite{cartier2}, Pierre Cartier conjectured that for any non commutative formal power series \Phi on X=\{x_0,x_1\} with coefficients in a \Q-extension, A, subjected to some suitable conditions, there exists an unique algebra homomorphism \varphi from the \Q-algebra generated by the convergent polyz\^etas to A such that \Phi is computed from \Phi_{KZ} Drinfel'd associator by applying \varphi to each coefficient. We prove \varphi exists and it is a free Lie exponential over X. Moreover, we give a complete description of the kernel of polyz\^eta and draw some consequences about a structure of the algebra of convergent polyz\^etas and about the arithmetical nature of the Euler constant.
