The scrambling index of an n\times n primitive matrix A is the smallest positive integer k such that A^k(A^{t})^k=J, where A^t denotes the transpose of A and J denotes the n\times n all ones matrix. For an m\times n Boolean matrix M, its {\it Boolean rank} b(M) is the smallest positive integer b such that M=AB for some m \times b Boolean matrix A and b\times n Boolean matrix B. In this paper, we give an upper bound on the scrambling index of an n\times n primitive matrix M in terms of its Boolean rank b(M). Furthermore we characterize all primitive matrices that achieve the upper bound.
