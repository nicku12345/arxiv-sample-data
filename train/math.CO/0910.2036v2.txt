We interpret noncrossing partitions of type B and type D in terms of noncrossing partitions of type A. As an application, we get type-preserving bijections between noncrossing and nonnesting partitions of type B, type C and type D which are different from those in the recent work of Fink and Giraldo. We also define Catalan tableaux of type B and type D, and find bijections between them and noncrossing partitions of type B and type D respectively.
