Let G be a connected graph with the usual shortest-path metric d. The graph G is \delta-hyperbolic provided for any vertices x,y,u,v in it, the two larger of the three sums d(u,v)+d(x,y),d(u,x)+d(v,y) and d(u,y)+d(v,x) differ by at most 2\delta. The graph G is k-chordal provided it has no induced cycle of length greater than k. Brinkmann, Koolen and Moulton find that every 3-chordal graph is 1-hyperbolic and is not 1/2-hyperbolic if and only if it contains one of two special graphs as an isometric subgraph. For every k\geq 4, we show that a k-chordal graph must be \frac{\lfloor \frac{k}{2}\rfloor}{2}-hyperbolic and there does exist a k-chordal graph which is not \frac{\lfloor \frac{k-2}{2}\rfloor}{2}-hyperbolic. Moreover, we prove that a 5-chordal graph is 1/2-hyperbolic if and only if it does not contain any of a list of six special graphs (See Fig. 3) as an isometric subgraph.
