Column-convex polyominoes are by now a well-explored model. So far, however, no attention has been given to polyominoes whose columns can have either one or two connected components. This little known kind of polyominoes seems not to be manageable as a whole. To obtain solvable models, one needs to introduce some restrictions. This paper is focused on polyominoes with hexagonal cells. The restrictions just mentioned are semidirectedness and an upper bound on the size of the gap within a column. The solvable models so obtained have rational area generating functions, as column-convex polyominoes do. However, the growth constants of the new models are 4.114908 and more, whereas the growth constant of column-convex polyominoes is 3.863131.
