It is shown that linked systems of symmetric designs with a_1^*=0 and mutually unbiased bases (MUB) are triply regular association schemes. In this paper, we characterize triple regularity of linked systems of symmetric designs by its Krein number. And we prove that maximal MUB carries a quadruply regular association scheme and characterize the quadruple regularity of MUB by its parameter.
