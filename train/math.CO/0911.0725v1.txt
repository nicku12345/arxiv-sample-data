The concept of a flock of a quadratic cone is generalized to arbitrary cones. Flocks whose planes contain a common point are called star flocks. Star flocks can be described in terms of their coordinate functions. If the cone is "big enough", the star flocks it admits can be classified by means of a connection with minimal blocking sets of Redei type. This connection can also be used to obtain examples of bilinear flocks of non-quadratic cones.
