A simplified version of the theory of strongly regular graphs is developed for the case in which the graphs have no triangles. This leads to (i) direct proofs of the Krein conditions, and (ii) the characterization of strongly regular graphs with no triangles such that the second subconstituent is also strongly regular. The method also provides an effective means of listing feasible parameters for such graphs.
