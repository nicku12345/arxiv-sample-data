In this paper, we introduce polynomial time algorithms that generate random k-noncrossing partitions and 2-regular, k-noncrossing partitions with uniform probability. A k-noncrossing partition does not contain any k mutually crossing arcs in its canonical representation and is 2-regular if the latter does not contain arcs of the form (i,i+1). Using a bijection of Chen {\it et al.} \cite{Chen,Reidys:08tan}, we interpret k-noncrossing partitions and 2-regular, k-noncrossing partitions as restricted generalized vacillating tableaux. Furthermore, we interpret the tableaux as sampling paths of a Markov-processes over shapes and derive their transition probabilities.
