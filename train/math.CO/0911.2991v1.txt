For every prime p > 2 we exhibit a Cayley graph of \mathbb{Z}_p^{2p+3} which is not a CI-graph. This proves that an elementary Abelian p-group of rank greater than or equal to 2p+3 is not a CI-group. The proof is elementary and uses only multivariate polynomials and basic tools of linear algebra. Moreover, we apply our technique to give a uniform explanation for the recent works concerning the bound.
