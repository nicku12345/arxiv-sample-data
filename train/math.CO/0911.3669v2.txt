A 2k-matching is a perfect matching of the complete graph on 2k vertices. Two 2k-matchings are defined to be t-intersecting if they have at least t edges in common. The main result in this paper is that if k \geq 3t/2+1, then the largest system of t-intersecting 2k-matchings has size (2(k-t)-1)!! = \prod_{i=0}^{k-t-1}(2k-2t-2i-1) and the only systems that meet this bound consist of all 2k-matchings that contain a set of t disjoint edges. Further, this bound on k is sharp for t\geq 6. The method used is this paper is similar to the proof of the complete Erd\H{o}s-Ko-Rado theorem given by Ahlswede and Khachatrian.
