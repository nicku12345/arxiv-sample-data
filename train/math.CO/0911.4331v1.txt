We prove that for each k\ge0, the probability that a root vertex in a random planar graph has degree k tends to a computable constant d_k, so that the expected number of vertices of degree k is asymptotically d_k n, and moreover that \sum_k d_k =1.   The proof uses the tools developed by Gimenez and Noy in their solution to the problem of the asymptotic enumeration of planar graphs, and is based on a detailed analysis of the generating functions involved in counting planar graphs. However, in order to keep track of the degree of the root, new technical difficulties arise. We obtain explicit, although quite involved expressions, for the coefficients in the singular expansions of the generating functions of interest, which allow us to use transfer theorems in order to get an explicit expression for the probability generating function p(w)=\sum_k d_k w^k. From this we can compute the d_k to any degree of accuracy, and derive the asymptotic estimate d_k \sim c\cdot k^{-1/2} q^k for large values of k, where q \approx 0.67 is a constant defined analytically.
