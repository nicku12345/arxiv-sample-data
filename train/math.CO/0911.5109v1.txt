Steingrimsson (2001) showed that the chromatic polynomial of a graph is the Hilbert function of a relative Stanley-Reisner ideal. We approach this result from the point of view of Ehrhart theory and give a sufficient criterion for when the Ehrhart polynomial of a given relative polytopal complex is a Hilbert function in Steingrimsson's sense. We use this result to establish that the modular and integral flow and tension polynomials of a graph are Hilbert functions.
