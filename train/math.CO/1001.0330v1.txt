In this note we study and compare three graph invariants related to the 'compactness' of graph drawing in the plane: the dilation coefficient, defined as the smallest possible quotient between the longest and the shortest edge length; the plane-width, which is the smallest possible quotient between the largest distance between any two points and the shortest length of an edge; and the resolution coefficient, the smallest possible quotient between the longest edge length and the smallest distance between any two points. These three invariants coincide for complete graphs.   We show that graphs with large dilation coefficient or plane-width have a vertex with large valence but there exist cubic graphs with arbitrarily large resolution coefficient. Surprisingly enough, the one-dimensional analogues of these three invariants allow us to revisit the three well known graph parameters: the circular chromatic number, the chromatic number, and the bandwidth. We also examine the connection between bounded resolution coefficient and minor-closed graph classes.
