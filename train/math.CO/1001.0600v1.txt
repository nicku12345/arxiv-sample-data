A structure is called homogeneous if every isomorphism between finite substructures of the structure extends to an automorphism of the structure. Recently, P. J. Cameron and J. Ne\v{s}et\v{r}il introduced a relaxed version of homogeneity: we say that a structure is homomorphism-homogeneous if every homomorphism between finite substructures of the structure extends to an endomorphism of the structure. In this paper we characterize all finite homomorphism-homogeneous relational systems with one irreflexive binary relation.
