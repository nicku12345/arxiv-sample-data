There is a sufficiently large N\in h\mathbb{N} such that the following holds. If G is a tripartite graph with N vertices in each vertex class such that every vertex is adjacent to at least 2N/3+2h-1 vertices in each of the other classes, then G can be tiled perfectly by copies of K_{h,h,h}. This extends work by two of the authors [Electron. J. Combin, 16(1), 2009] and also gives a sufficient condition for tiling by any fixed 3-colorable graph. Furthermore, we show that 2N/3+2h-1 in our result can not be replaced by 2N/3+ h-2 and that if N is divisible by 6h, then we can replace it with the value 2N/3+h-1 and this is tight.
