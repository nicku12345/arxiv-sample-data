A 2-cell embedding of a graph G into a closed (orientable or nonorientable) surface is called regular if its automorphism group acts regularly on the flags - mutually incident vertex-edge-face triples. In this paper, we classify the regular embeddings of complete bipartite graphs K_{n,n} into nonorientable surfaces. Such regular embedding of K_{n,n} exists only when n = 2p_1^{a_1}p_2^{a_2}... p_k^{a_k} (a prime decomposition of n) and all p_i \equiv \pm 1 (\mod 8). In this case, the number of those regular embeddings of K_{n,n} up to isomorphism is 2^k.
