We give a recursion formula to generate all equivalence classes of biconnected graphs with coefficients given by the inverses of the orders of their groups of automorphisms. We give a linear map to produce a connected graph with say, u, biconnected components from one with u-1 biconnected components. We use such map to extend the aforesaid result to connected or 2-edge connected graphs. The underlying algorithms are amenable to computer implementation.
