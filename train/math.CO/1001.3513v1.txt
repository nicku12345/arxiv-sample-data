The random Fibonacci chain is a generalisation of the classical Fibonacci substitution and is defined as the rule mapping 0\mapsto 1 and 1 \mapsto 01 with probability p and 1 \mapsto 10 with probability 1-p for 0<p<1 and where the random rule is applied each time it acts on a 1. We show that the topological entropy of this object is given by the growth rate of the set of inflated random Fibonacci words.
