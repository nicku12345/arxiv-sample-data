A method is given for determining a mixed social choice out of a paired-comparison matrix. The method combines a projection procedure introduced in previous papers of the same authors and a classical method due to Zermelo. The resulting method is proved to have certain desirable properties, which include: compliance with a majority principle, clone consistency, and continuity of the mixing fractions with respect to the data.
