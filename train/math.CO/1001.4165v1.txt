Given arbitrary integers k and d with 0 \leq 2k \leq d, we construct a Gorenstein Fano polytope \Pc \subset \RR^d of dimension d such that (i) its Ehrhart polynomial i(\Pc, n) possesses d distinct roots; (ii) i(\Pc, n) possesses exactly 2k imaginary roots; (iii) i(\Pc, n) possesses exactly d - 2k real roots; (iv) the real part of each of the imaginary roots is equal to - 1 / 2; (v) all of the real roots belong to the open interval (-1, 0).
