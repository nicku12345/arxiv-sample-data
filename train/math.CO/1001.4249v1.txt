In this note, extending some results of Erdos, Frankl, Rodl, Alexeev, Bollobas and Thomason we determine asymptotically the number of graphs which do not contain certain large subgraphs. In particular, if H_1,...,H_n,... are graphs with chromatic numbers r_1,...,r_n,... and order o(log n), we dermine asymptotically the number of graphs of order n not containing H_n as a subgraph. We also give similar results for induced subgraphs.
