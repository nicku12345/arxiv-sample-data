It is known that the Littlewood-Richardson coefficients can be calculated using a certain class of measures, and these measures have a rigidity property when the coefficient is equal to 1. Rigid measures decompose uniquely into sums of extremal rigid measures. We show that the number of extremal summands is closely related with geometric data easily obtained from the support of the measure.
