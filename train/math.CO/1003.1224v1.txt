The properties characterizing Sturmian words are considered for words on multiliteral alphabets. We summarize various generalizations of Sturmian words to multiliteral alphabets and enlarge the list of known relationships among these generalizations. We also collect many examples of infinite words to illustrate differences in the generalized definitions of Sturmian words.
