We consider a new family of factorial languages whose subword complexity grows as \Theta(n^{\alpha}), where \alpha is the root of some transcendent equation. Analytical methods and in particular, a corollary of the Wiener-Pitt theorem, are used to find the asymptotic growth of the complexity. Factorial languages considered are languages of arithmetical factors of some Toeplitz words. So, we describe a new family of words with an unusual growth of arithmetical complexity.
