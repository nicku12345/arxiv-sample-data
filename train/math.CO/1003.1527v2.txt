Amit, Linial, and Matou\vsek (Random lifts of graphs III: independence and chromatic number, Random Struct. Algorithms, 2001) have raised the following question: Is the chromatic number of random h-lifts of K_5 asymptotically (for h\to\infty) almost surely equal to a single number? In this paper, we offer the following partial result: The chromatic number of a random lift of K_5\setminus e is asymptotically almost surely three.
