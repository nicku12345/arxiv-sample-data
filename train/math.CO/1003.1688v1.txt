We consider the skew diagram \Delta_n, which is the 180^\circ rotation of the staircase diagram \delta_n = (n,n-1,n-2,...,2,1). We create a staircase with bad foundation by augmenting \Delta_n with another skew diagram, which we call the \textit{foundation}. We consider pairs of staircases with bad foundation whose foundations are transposes of one another. Among these pairs, we show that the difference of the corresponding skew Schur functions is Schur-positive in the case when one of the foundations consists of either a one or two row diagram, or a hook diagram.
