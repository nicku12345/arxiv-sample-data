Let \FF be a finite field of characteristics different from two. We show that no bijective map transforms permanent into determinant when the cardinality of \FF is sufficiently large. We also give an example of non-bijective map when \FF is arbitrary and an example of a bijective map when \FF is infinite which do transform permanent into determinant. The developed technique allows us to estimate the probability of the permanent and the determinant of matrices over finite fields to have a given value. Our results are also true over finite rings without zero divisors.
