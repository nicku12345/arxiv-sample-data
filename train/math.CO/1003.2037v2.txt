For a property \cal P of simplicial complexes, a simplicial complex \Gamma is an obstruction to \cal P if \Gamma itself does not satisfy \cal P but all of its proper restrictions satisfy \cal P. In this paper, we determine all obstructions to shellability of dimension \le 2, refining the previous work by Wachs. As a consequence we obtain that the set of obstructions to shellability, that to partitionability and that to sequential Cohen-Macaulayness all coincide for dimensions \le 2. We also show that these three sets of obstructions coincide in the class of flag complexes. These results show that the three properties, hereditary-shellability, hereditary-partitionability, and hereditary-sequential Cohen-Macaulayness are equivalent for these classes.
