We prove that the subset of quasisymmetric polynomials conjectured by Bergeron and Reutenauer to be a basis for the coinvariant space of quasisymmetric polynomials is indeed a basis. This provides the first constructive proof of the Garsia-Wallach result stating that quasisymmetric polynomials form a free module over symmetric polynomials and that the dimension of this module is n!.
