A \emph{2-matching} in an undirected graph G = (VG, EG) is a function f \colon EG \to \set{0,1,2} such that for each node v \in VG the sum of values f(e) on all edges e incident to v does not exceed~2. The \emph{size} of f is the sum \sum_e f(e). If \set{e \in EG \mid f(e) \ne 0} contains no triangles then f is called \emph{triangle-free}. Cornu\'ejols and Pulleyblank devised a combinatorial O(mn)-algorithm that finds a triangle free 2-matching of maximum size (hereinafter n := \abs{VG}, m := \abs{EG}) and also established a min-max theorem. We claim that this approach is, in fact, superfluous by demonstrating how their results may be obtained directly from the Edmonds--Gallai decomposition. Applying the algorithm of Micali and Vazirani we are able to find a maximum triangle-free 2-matching in O(m\sqrt{n})-time. Also we give a short self-contained algorithmic proof of the min-max theorem. Next, we consider the case of regular graphs. It is well-known that every regular graph admits a perfect 2-matching. One can easily strengthen this result and prove that every d-regular graph (for d \geq 3) contains a perfect triangle-free 2-matching. We give the following algorithms for finding a perfect triangle-free 2-matching in a d-regular graph: an O(n)-algorithm for d = 3, an O(m + n^{3/2})-algorithm for d = 2k (k \ge 2), and an O(n^2)-algorithm for d = 2k + 1 (k \ge 2). We also prove that there exists a constant c > 1 such that every 3-regular graph contains at least c^n perfect triangle-free 2-matchings.
