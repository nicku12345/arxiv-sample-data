Let V be an n-dimensional vector space (4\le n <\infty) and let {\mathcal G}_{k}(V) be the Grassmannian formed by all k-dimensional subspaces of V. The corresponding Grassmann graph will be denoted by \Gamma_{k}(V). We describe all isometric embeddings of Johnson graphs J(l,m), 1<m<l-1 in \Gamma_{k}(V), 1<k<n-1 (Theorem 4). As a consequence, we get the following: the image of every isometric embedding of J(n,k) in \Gamma_{k}(V) is an apartment of {\mathcal G}_{k}(V) if and only if n=2k. Our second result (Theorem 5) is a classification of rigid isometric embeddings of Johnson graphs in \Gamma_{k}(V), 1<k<n-1.
