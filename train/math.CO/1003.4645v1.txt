We prove that the near hexagon Q(5,2) \times \mathbb{L}_3 has a non-abelian representation in the extra-special 2-group 2^{1+12}_+ and that the near hexagon Q(5,2) \otimes Q(5,2) has a non-abelian representation in the extra-special 2-group 2^{1+18}_-. The description of the non-abelian representation of Q(5,2) \otimes Q(5,2) makes use of a new combinatorial construction of this near hexagon.
