Let G=(V,E) be a connected graph. The distance between two vertices u,v\in V, denoted by d(u, v), is the length of a shortest u-v path in G. The distance between a vertex v\in V and a subset P\subset V is defined as min\{d(v, x): x \in P\}, and it is denoted by d(v, P). An ordered partition \{P_1,P_2, ...,P_t\} of vertices of a graph G, is a \emph{resolving partition}of G, if all the distance vectors (d(v,P_1),d(v,P_2),...,d(v,P_t)) are different. The \emph{partition dimension} of G, denoted by pd(G), is the minimum number of sets in any resolving partition of G. In this article we study the partition dimension of Cartesian product graphs. More precisely, we show that for all pairs of connected graphs G, H, pd(G\times H)\le pd(G)+pd(H) and pd(G\times H)\le pd(G)+dim(H). Consequently, we show that pd(G\times H)\le dim(G)+dim(H)+1.
