We study a new kind of proximity graphs called proportional-edge proximity catch digraphs (PCDs)in a randomized setting. PCDs are a special kind of random catch digraphs that have been developed recently and have applications in statistical pattern classification and spatial point pattern analysis. PCDs are also a special type of intersection digraphs; and for one-dimensional data, the proportional-edge PCD family is also a family of random interval catch digraphs. We present the exact (and asymptotic) distribution of the domination number of this PCD family for uniform (and non-uniform) data in one dimension. We also provide several extensions of this random catch digraph by relaxing the expansion and centrality parameters, thereby determine the parameters for which the asymptotic distribution is non-degenerate. We observe sudden jumps (from degeneracy to non-degeneracy or from a non-degenerate distribution to another) in the asymptotic distribution of the domination number at certain parameter values.
