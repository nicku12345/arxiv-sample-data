Several polytopes arise from finite graphs. For edge and symmetric edge polytopes, in particular, exhaustive computation of the Ehrhart polynomials not merely supports the conjecture of Beck {\it et al.}\ that all roots \alpha of Ehrhart polynomials of polytopes of dimension D satisfy -D \le \Re(\alpha) \le D - 1, but also reveals some interesting phenomena for each type of polytope. Here we present two new conjectures: (1) the roots of the Ehrhart polynomial of an edge polytope for a complete multipartite graph of order d lie in the circle |z+\tfrac{d}{4}| \le \tfrac{d}{4} or are negative integers, and (2) a Gorenstein Fano polytope of dimension D has the roots of its Ehrhart polynomial in the narrower strip -\tfrac{D}{2} \leq \Re(\alpha) \leq \tfrac{D}{2}-1. Some rigorous results to support them are obtained as well as for the original conjecture. The root distribution of Ehrhart polynomials of each type of polytope is plotted in figures.
