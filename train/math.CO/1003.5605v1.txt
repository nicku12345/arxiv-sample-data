We define a fat staircase to be a Ferrers diagram corresponding to a partition of the form (n^{\alpha_n}, {n-1}^{\alpha_{n-1}},..., 1^{\alpha_1}), where \alpha = (\alpha_1,...,\alpha_n) is a composition, or the 180^\circ rotation of such a diagram. We look at collections of skew diagrams consisting of a fixed fat staircase augmented with all hooks of a given size. Among these diagrams we determine precisely which pairs give a Schur-positive difference. We extend this classification to collections of fat staircases augmented with hook-complements.
