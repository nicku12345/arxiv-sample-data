Given a countable set X (usually taken to be the natural numbers or the integers), an infinite permutation \pi of X is a linear ordering of X. This paper investigates the combinatorial complexity of the infinite permutation on the natural numbers associated with the well-known and well-studied Thue-Morse word. A formula for the complexity is established by studying patterns in subpermutations and the action of the Thue-Morse morphism on the subpermutations.
