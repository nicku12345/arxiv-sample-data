We prove that the sizes of the maximal dissociated subsets of a given finite subset of an abelian group differ by a logarithmic factor at most. On the other hand, we show that the set \{0,1\}^n\seq\Z^n possesses a dissociated subset of size \Ome(n\log n); since the standard basis of \Z^n is a maximal dissociated subset of \{0,1\}^n of size n, the result just mentioned is essentially sharp.
