In this paper we study generalization of the reversal mapping realized by an arbitrary involutory antimorphism \Theta. It generalizes the notion of a palindrome into a \Theta-palindrome -- a word invariant under \Theta. For languages closed under \Theta we give the relation between \Theta-palindromic complexity and factor complexity. We generalize the notion of richness to \Theta-richness and we prove analogous characterizations of words that are \Theta-rich, especially in the case of set of factors invariant under \Theta. A criterion for \Theta-richness of \Theta-episturmian words is given together with other examples of \Theta-rich words.
