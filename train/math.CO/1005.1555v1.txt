In this paper we study a family of 2-pile Take Away games, that we denote by Generalized Diagonal Wythoff Nim (GDWN). The story begins with 2-pile Nim whose sets of options and P-positions are \{\{0,t\}\mid t\in \N\} and \{(t,t)\mid t\in \M \} respectively. If we to 2-pile Nim adjoin the main-\emph{diagonal} \{(t,t)\mid t\in \N\} as options, the new game is Wythoff Nim. It is well-known that the P-positions of this game lie on two 'beams' originating at the origin with slopes \Phi= \frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2}>1 and \frac{1}{\Phi} < 1. Hence one may think of this as if, in the process of going from Nim to Wythoff Nim, the set of P-positions has \emph{split} and landed some distance off the main diagonal. This geometrical observation has motivated us to ask the following intuitive question. Does this splitting of the set of P-positions continue in some meaningful way if we, to the game of Wythoff Nim, adjoin some new \emph{generalized diagonal} move, that is a move of the form \{pt, qt\}, where 0 < p < q are fixed positive integers and t > 0? Does the answer perhaps depend on the specific values of p and q? We state three conjectures of which the weakest form is: \lim_{t\in \N}\frac{b_t}{a_t} exists, and equals \Phi, if and only if (p, q) is a certain \emph{non-splitting pair}, and where \{\{a_t, b_t\}\} represents the set of P-positions of the new game. Then we prove this conjecture for the special case (p,q) = (1,2) (a \emph{splitting pair}). We prove the other direction whenever q / p < \Phi. In the Appendix, a variety of experimental data is included, aiming to point out some directions for future work on GDWN games.
