Let G=(V,E) be a simple undirected graph with n vertices then a set partition \pi=\{V_1, ..., V_k\} of the vertex set of G is a connected set partition if each subgraph G[V_j] induced by the blocks V_j of \pi is connected for 1\le j\le k. Define q_{i}(G) as the number of connected set partitions in G with i blocks. The partition polynomial is then Q(G, x)=\sum_{i=0}^n q_{i}(G)x^i. This paper presents a splitting approach to the partition polynomial on a separating vertex set X in G and summarizes some properties of the bond lattice. Furthermore the bivariate partition polynomial Q(G,x,y)=\sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=1}^m q_{ij}(G)x^iy^j is briefly discussed, where q_{ij}(G) counts the number of connected set partitions with i blocks and j intra block edges. Finally the complexity for the bivariate partition polynomial is proven to be \sharp P-hard.
