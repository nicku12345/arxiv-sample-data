Reiner, Stanton, and White \cite{RSWCSP} proved results regarding the enumeration of polygon dissections up to rotational symmetry. Eu and Fu \cite{EuFu} generalized these results to Cartan-Killing types other than A by means of actions of deformed Coxeter elements on cluster complexes of Fomin and Zelevinsky \cite{FZY}. The Reiner-Stanton-White and Eu-Fu results were proven using direct counting arguments. We give representation theoretic proofs of closely related results using the notion of noncrossing and semi-noncrossing tableaux due to Pylyavskyy \cite{PN} as well as some geometric realizations of finite type cluster algebras due to Fomin and Zelevinsky \cite{FZClusterII}.
