Motivated by the recent work of Chu [Electron. J. Combin. 17 (2010), #N24], we give simple proofs of Jensen's identity  \sum_{k=0}^{n}{x+kz\choose k}{y-kz\choose n-k} =\sum_{k=0}^{n}{x+y-k\choose n-k}z^k,  and Chu's and Mohanty-Handa's generalizations of Jensen's identity. We also give a quite simple proof of an equivalent form of Graham-Knuth-Patashnik's identity  \sum_{k\geq 0}{m+r\choose m-n-k}{n+k\choose n}x^{m-n-k}y^k =\sum_{k\geq 0}{-r\choose m-n-k}{n+k\choose n}(-x)^{m-n-k}(x+y)^k,  which was rediscovered, respectively, by Sun in 2003 and Munarini in 2005. Finally we give a multinomial coefficient generalization of this identity and raise two open problems.
