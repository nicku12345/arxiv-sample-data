For a graph L and an integer k\geq 2, R_k(L) denotes the smallest integer N for which for any edge-colouring of the complete graph K_N by k colours there exists a colour i for which the corresponding colour class contains L as a subgraph.   Bondy and Erd\H{o}s conjectured that for an odd cycle C_n on n vertices, R_k(C_n) = 2^{k-1}(n-1)+1 \text{for n>3.} They proved the case when k=2 and also provided an upper bound R_k(C_n)\leq (k+2)!n. Recently, this conjecture has been verified for k=3 if n is large. In this note, we prove that for every integer k\geq 4, R_k(C_n)\leq k2^kn+o(n), \text{as n\to\infty.} When n is even, Yongqi, Yuansheng, Feng, and Bingxi gave a construction, showing that R_k(C_n)\geq (k-1)n-2k+4. Here we prove that if n is even, then R_k(C_n)\leq kn+o(n), \text{as n\to\infty.}
