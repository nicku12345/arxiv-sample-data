We prove a recent conjecture of Duch\^ene and Rigo, stating that every complementary pair of homogeneous Beatty sequences represents the solution to an \emph{invariant} impartial game. Here invariance means that each available move in a game can be played anywhere inside the game-board. In fact, we establish such a result for a wider class of pairs of complementary sequences, and in the process generalize the notion of a \emph{subtraction game}. Given a pair of complementary sequences (a_n) and (b_n) of positive integers, we define a game G by setting \{\{a_n, b_n\}\} as invariant moves. We then introduce the invariant game G^\star , whose moves are all non-zero P-positions of G. Provided the set of non-zero P-positions of G^\star equals \{\{a_n,b_n\}\}, this \emph{is} the desired invariant game. We give sufficient conditions on the initial pair of sequences for this 'duality' to hold.
