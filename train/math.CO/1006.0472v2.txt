Our earlier article proved that if n > 1 translates of sublattices of Z^d tile Z^d, and all the sublattices are Cartesian products of arithmetic progressions, then two of the tiles must be translates of each other. We re-prove this Theorem, this time using generating functions. We also show that for d \geq 1, not every finite tiling of Z^d by lattices can be obtained from the trivial tiling by the process of repeatedly subdividing a tile into sub-tiles that are translates of one another.
