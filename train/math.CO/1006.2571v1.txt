A king invites n couples to sit around a round table with 2n+1 seats. For each couple, the king decides a prescribed distance d between 1 and n which the two spouses have to be seated from each other (distance d means that they are separated by exactly d-1 chairs). We will show that there is a solution for every choice of the distances if and only if 2n+1 is a prime number, using a theorem known as Combinatorial Nullstellensatz.
