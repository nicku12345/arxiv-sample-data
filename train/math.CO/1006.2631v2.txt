S. -R. Kim and F. S. Roberts (2002) introduced the following conditions C(p) and C'(p) for digraphs as generalizations of the condition for digraphs to be semiorders. The condition C(p) (resp. C'(p)) is: For any set S of p vertices in D, there exists x \in S such that N^+_D(x) \subseteq N^+_D(y) (resp. N^-_D(x) \subseteq N^-_D(y)) for all y \in S, where N^+_D(x) (resp. N^-_D(x)) is the set of out-neighbors (resp. in-neighbors) of x in D. The competition graph of a digraph D is the (simple undirected) graph which has the same vertex set as D and has an edge between two distinct vertices x and y if N^+_D(x) \cap N^+_D(y) \neq \emptyset. Kim and Roberts characterized the competition graphs of digraphs which satisfy Condition C(p). The competition-common enemy graph of a digraph D is the graph which has the same vertex set as D and has an edge between two distinct vertices x and y if it holds that both N^+_D(x) \cap N^+_D(y) \neq \emptyset and N^-_D(x) \cap N^-_D(y) \neq \emptyset. In this note, we characterize the competition-common enemy graphs of digraphs satisfying Conditions C(p) and C'(p).
