Let \gamma_n be the permutation on n symbols defined by \gamma_n = (1\ 2\...\ n). We are interested in an enumerative problem on colored permutations, that is permutations \beta of n in which the numbers from 1 to n are colored with p colors such that two elements in a same cycle have the same color. We show that the proportion of colored permutations such that \gamma_n \beta^{-1} is a long cycle is given by the very simple ratio \frac{1}{n- p+1}. Our proof is bijective and uses combinatorial objects such as partitioned hypermaps and thorn trees. This formula is actually equivalent to the proportionality of the number of long cycles \alpha such that \gamma_n\alpha has m cycles and Stirling numbers of size n+1, an unexpected connection previously found by several authors by means of algebraic methods. Moreover, our bijection allows us to refine the latter result with the cycle type of the permutations.
