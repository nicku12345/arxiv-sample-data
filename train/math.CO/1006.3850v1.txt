A distributive lattice L with minimum element 0 is called decomposable lattice if a and b are not comparable elements in L there exist \overline{a},\overline{b}\in L such that a=\overline{a}\vee(a\wedge b), b=\overline{b}\vee(a\wedge b) and \overline{a}\wedge \overline{b}=0. The main purpose of this paper is to investigate prime ideals, minimal prime ideals and special ideals of a decomposable lattice. These are keys to understand the algebraic structure of decomposable lattices.
