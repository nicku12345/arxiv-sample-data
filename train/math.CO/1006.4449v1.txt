We consider possible reconstructions of a binary image of which the row and column sums are given. For any reconstruction we can define the length of the boundary of the image. In this paper we prove a new lower bound on the length of this boundary. In contrast to simple bounds that have been derived previously, in this new lower bound the information of both row and column sums is combined.
