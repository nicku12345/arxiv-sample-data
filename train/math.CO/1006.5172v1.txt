A unicellular map is the embedding of a connected graph in a surface in such a way that the complement of the graph is a topological disk. In this paper we present a bijective link between unicellular maps on a non-orientable surface and unicellular maps of a lower topological type, with distinguished vertices. From that we obtain a recurrence equation that leads to (new) explicit counting formulas for non-orientable unicellular maps of fixed topology. In particular, we give exact formulas for the precubic case (all vertices of degree 1 or 3), and asymptotic formulas for the general case, when the number of edges goes to infinity. Our strategy is inspired by recent results obtained by the second author for the orientable case, but significant novelties are introduced: in particular we construct an involution which, in some sense, "averages" the effects of non-orientability.
