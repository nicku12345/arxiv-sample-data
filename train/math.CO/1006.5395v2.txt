We use finite incident structures to construct new infinite families of directed strongly regular graphs with parameters \[(l(q-1)q^l,\ l(q-1)q^{l-1},\ (lq-l+1)q^{l-2},\ (l-1)(q-1)q^{l-2},\ (lq-l+1)q^{l-2})\] for integers q and l (q, l\ge 2), and \[(lq^2(q-1),\ lq(q-1),\ lq-l+1,\ (l-1)(q-1),\ lq-l+1)\] for all prime powers q and l\in \{1, 2,..., q\}. The new graphs given by these constructions have parameters (36, 12, 5, 2, 5), (54, 18, 7, 4, 7), (72, 24, 10, 4, 10), (96, 24, 7, 3, 7), (108, 36, 14, 8, 14) and (108, 36, 15, 6, 15) listed as feasible parameters on "Parameters of directed strongly regular graphs," at {http://homepages.cwi.nl/^\sim aeb/math/dsrg/dsrg.html} by S. Hobart and A. E. Brouwer. We review these constructions and show how our methods may be used to construct other infinite families of directed strongly regular graphs.
