We study pairs (\Gamma,G), where \Gamma is a 'Buekenhout-Tits' pregeometry with all rank 2 truncations connected, and G\leqslant\mathrm{Aut} \Gamma is transitive on the set of elements of each type. The family of such pairs is closed under forming quotients with respect to G-invariant type-refining partitions of the element set of \Gamma. We identify the 'basic' pairs (those that admit no non-degenerate quotients), and show, by studying quotients and direct decompositions, that the study of basic pregeometries reduces to examining those where the group G is faithful and primitive on the set of elements of each type. We also study the special case of normal quotients, where we take quotients with respect to the orbits of a normal subgroup of G. There is a similar reduction for normal-basic pregeometries to those where G is faithful and quasiprimitive on the set of elements of each type.
