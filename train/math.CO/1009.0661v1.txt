In the study of the algebra \mathrm{NCSym} of symmetric functions in noncommutative variables, Bergeron and Zabrocki found a free generating set consisting of power sum symmetric functions indexed by atomic partitions. On the other hand, Bergeron, Reutenauer, Rosas, and Zabrocki studied another free generating set of \mathrm{NCSym} consisting of monomial symmetric functions indexed by unsplitable partitions. Can and Sagan raised the question of finding a bijection between atomic partitions and unsplitable partitions. In this paper, we provide such a bijection.
