The Flag Complex Conjecture of Charney and Davis states that for a simplicial complex S which triangulates a (2n - 1)-generalized homology sphere as a flag complex one has (-1)^n \sum_{\sigma \in S} \left(\frac{-1}{2}\right)^{\dim\sigma + 1} \ge 0, where the sum runs over all simplices \sigma of S (including the empty simplex). Interpreting the 1-skeleta of \sigma\in S as graphs of Coxeter groups, we present a stronger version of this conjecture, and prove the equivalence of the latter to the Flag Complex Conjecture.
