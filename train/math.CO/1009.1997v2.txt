Let \Pi be a polar space of rank n and let {\mathcal G}_{k}(\Pi), k\in \{0,\dots,n-1\} be the polar Grassmannian formed by k-dimensional singular subspaces of \Pi. The corresponding Grassmann graph will be denoted by \Gamma_{k}(\Pi). We consider the polar Grassmannian {\mathcal G}_{n-1}(\Pi) formed by maximal singular subspaces of \Pi and show that the image of every isometric embedding of the n-dimensional hypercube graph H_{n} in \Gamma_{n-1}(\Pi) is an apartment of {\mathcal G}_{n-1}(\Pi). This follows from a more general result (Theorem 2) concerning isometric embeddings of H_{m}, m\le n in \Gamma_{n-1}(\Pi). As an application, we classify all isometric embeddings of \Gamma_{n-1}(\Pi) in \Gamma_{n'-1}(\Pi'), where \Pi' is a polar space of rank n'\ge n (Theorem 3).
