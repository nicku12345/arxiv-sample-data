In this paper we shall survey the various methods of evaluating Hankel determinants and as an illustration we evaluate some Hankel determinants of a q-analogue of Catalan numbers. Here we consider \frac{(aq;q)_{n}}{(abq^{2};q)_{n}} as a q-analogue of Catalan numbers C_{n}=\frac1{n+1}\binom{2n}{n}, which is known as the moments of the little q-Jacobi polynomials. We also give several proofs of this q-analogue, in which we use lattice paths, the orthogonal polynomials, or the basic hypergeometric series. We also consider a q-analogue of Schr\"oder Hankel determinants, and give a new proof of Moztkin Hankel determinants using an addition formula for {}_2F_{1}.
