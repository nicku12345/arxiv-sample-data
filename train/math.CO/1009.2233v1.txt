The Springer numbers are defined in connection with the irreducible root systems of type B_n, which also arise as the generalized Euler and class numbers introduced by Shanks. Combinatorial interpretations of the Springer numbers have been found by Purtill in terms of Andre signed permutations, and by Arnol'd in terms of snakes of type B_n. We introduce the inversion code of a snake of type B_n and establish a bijection between labeled ballot paths of length n and snakes of type B_n. Moreover, we obtain the bivariate generating function for the number B(n,k) of labeled ballot paths starting at (0,0) and ending at (n,k). Using our bijection, we find a statistic \alpha such that the number of snakes \pi of type B_n with \alpha(\pi)=k equals B(n,k). We also show that our bijection specializes to a bijection between labeled Dyck paths of length 2n and alternating permutations on [2n].
