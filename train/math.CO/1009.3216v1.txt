In this paper we consider particular generalized compositions of a natural number with a given number of parts. Its number is a weighted polynomial coefficient. The number of all generalized compositions of a natural number is a weighted r-generalized Fibonacci number. A relationship between these two numbers will be derived.   We shall thus obtain a generalization of the well-known formula connecting Fibonacci numbers with the binomial coefficients.
