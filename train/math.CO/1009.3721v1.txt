We study the resilience of random and pseudorandom directed graphs with respect to the property of having long directed cycles. For every 0 < \gamma < 1/2 we find a constant c=c(\gamma) such that the following holds. Let G=(V,E) be a (pseudo)random directed graph on n vertices, and let G' be a subgraph of G with (1/2+\gamma)|E| edges. Then G' contains a directed cycle of length at least (c-o(1))n. Moreover, there is a subgraph G'' of G with (1/2+\gamma-o(1))|E| edges that does not contain a cycle of length at least cn.
