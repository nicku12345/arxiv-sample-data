We study 2-player impartial games, so called \emph{invariant subtraction games}, of the type, given a set of allowed moves the players take turn in moving one single piece on a large Chess board towards the position \boldsymbol 0. Here, invariance means that each allowed move is available inside the whole board. Then we define a new game, \star of the old game, by taking the P-positions, except \boldsymbol 0, as moves in the new game. One such game is \W^\star= (Wythoff Nim)^\star, where the moves are defined by complementary Beatty sequences with irrational moduli. Here we give a polynomial time algorithm for infinitely many P-positions of \W^\star. A repeated application of \star turns out to give especially nice properties for a certain subfamily of the invariant subtraction games, the \emph{permutation games}, which we introduce here. We also introduce the family of \emph{ornament games}, whose P-positions define complementary Beatty sequences with rational moduli---hence related to A. S. Fraenkel's `variant' Rat- and Mouse games---and give closed forms for the moves of such games. We also prove that (k-pile Nim)^{\star\star} = k-pile Nim.
