Let A be an a-letter alphabet. We consider fractional powers of A-strings: if x is a n-letter string, x^r is a prefix of xxxx... having length nr. Let l be a positive integer. Ilie, Ochem and Shallit defined R(a,l) as the infimum of reals r>1 such that there exist a sequence of A-letters without factors (substrings) that are fractional powers x^{r'} where x has length at least l and r'\ge r. We prove that 1+\frac{1}{la}\le R(a,l)\le 1+\frac{c}{la} for some constant c.
