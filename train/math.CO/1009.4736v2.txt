There are two properties shared by all known crossing-minimizing geometric drawings of K_n, for n a multiple of 3. First, the underlying n-point set of these drawings has exactly 3\binom{k+2}{2} (\le k)-edges, for all 0\le k < n/3. Second, all such drawings have the n points divided into three groups of equal size; this last property is captured under the concept of 3-decomposability. In this paper we show that these properties are tightly related: every n-point set with exactly 3\binom{k+2}{2} (\le k)-edges for all 0\le k < n/3, is 3-decomposable. As an application, we prove that the rectilinear crossing number of K_{30} is 9726.
