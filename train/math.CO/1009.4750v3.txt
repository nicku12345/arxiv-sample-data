Develin and Sturmfels showed that regular triangulations of \Delta_{n-1} \times \Delta_{d-1} can be thought as tropical polytopes. Tropical oriented matroids were defined by Ardila and Develin, and were conjectured to be in bijection with all subdivisions of \Delta_{n-1} \times \Delta_{d-1}. In this paper, we show that any triangulation of \Delta_{n-1} \times \Delta_{d-1} encodes a tropical oriented matroid. We also suggest a new class of combinatorial objects that may describe all subdivisions of a bigger class of polytopes.
