We focus on combinatorial aspects of the Hilbert series of the cohomology ring of the moduli space of stable pointed curves of genus zero. We show its graded Hilbert series satisfies an integral operator identity. This is used to give asymptotic behavior, and in some cases, exact values, of the coefficients themselves. We then study the total dimension, that is, the sum of the coefficients of the Hilbert series. Its asymptotic behavior involves the Lambert W function, which has applications to classical tree enumeration, signal processing and fluid mechanics.
