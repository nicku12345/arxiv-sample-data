We define the limiting density of a minor-closed family of simple graphs F to be the smallest number k such that every n-vertex graph in F has at most kn(1+o(1)) edges, and we investigate the set of numbers that can be limiting densities. This set of numbers is countable, well-ordered, and closed; its order type is at least {\omega}^{\omega}. It is the closure of the set of densities of density-minimal graphs, graphs for which no minor has a greater ratio of edges to vertices. By analyzing density-minimal graphs of low densities, we find all limiting densities up to the first two cluster points of the set of limiting densities, 1 and 3/2. For multigraphs, the only possible limiting densities are the integers and the superparticular ratios i/(i+1).
