Let \delta(\Pc) = (\delta_0, \delta_1,..., \delta_d) be the \delta-vector of an integral polytope \Pc \subset \RR^N of dimension d. Following the previous work of characterizing the \delta-vectors with \sum_{i=0}^d \delta_i \leq 3, the possible \delta-vectors with \sum_{i=0}^d \delta_i = 4 will be classified. And each possible \delta-vectors can be obtained by simplices. We get this result by studying the problem of classifying the possible integral simplices with a given \delta-vector (\delta_0, \delta_1,..., \delta_d), where \sum_{i=0}^d \delta_i \leq 4, by means of Hermite normal forms of square matrices.
