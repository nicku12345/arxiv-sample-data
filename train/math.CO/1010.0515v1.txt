Let W be a finite reflection group. For a given w \in W, the following assertion may or may not be satisfied:   (*) The principal Bruhat order ideal of w contains as many elements as there are regions in the inversion hyperplane arrangement of w.   We present a type independent combinatorial criterion which characterises the elements w\in W that satisfy (*). A couple of immediate consequences are derived:   (1) The criterion only involves the order ideal of w as an abstract poset. In this sense, (*) is a poset-theoretic property.   (2) For W of type A, another characterisation of (*), in terms of pattern avoidance, was previously given in collaboration with Linusson, Shareshian and Sj\"ostrand. We obtain a short and simple proof of that result.   (3) If W is a Weyl group and the Schubert variety indexed by w \in W is rationally smooth, then w satisfies (*).
