The permanental polynomial of a graph G is \pi(G,x)\triangleq\mathrm{per}(xI-A(G)). From the result that a bipartite graph G admits an orientation G^e such that every cycle is oddly oriented if and only if it contains no even subdivision of K_{2,3}, Yan and Zhang showed that the permanental polynomial of such a bipartite graph G can be expressed as the characteristic polynomial of the skew adjacency matrix A(G^e). In this paper we first prove that this equality holds only if the bipartite graph G contains no even subdivision of K_{2,3}. Then we prove that such bipartite graphs are planar. Further we mainly show that a 2-connected bipartite graph contains no even subdivision of K_{2,3} if and only if it is planar 1-cycle resonant. This implies that each cycle is oddly oriented in any Pfaffian orientation of a 2-connected bipartite graph containing no even subdivision of K_{2,3}. As applications, permanental polynomials for some types of bipartite graphs are computed.
