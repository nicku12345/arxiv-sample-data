We show that the principal results of the article "The metric dimension of graph with pendant edges" [Journal of Combinatorial Mathematics and Combinatorial Computing, 65 (2008) 139--145] do not hold. In this paper we correct the results and we solve two open problems described in the above mentioned paper.
