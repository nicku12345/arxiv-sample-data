Let D denote a positive integer and let Q_D denote the graph of the D-dimensional hypercube. Let X denote the vertex set of Q_D and let A \in \MX denote the adjacency matrix of Q_D. A matrix B \in \MX is called A-{\em like} whenever both (i) BA = AB; (ii) for all x,y \in X that are not equal or adjacent, the (x,y)-entry of B is zero. Let \Al denote the subspace of \MX consisting of the A-like elements. We decompose \Al into the direct sum of its symmetric part and antisymmetric part. We give a basis for each part. The dimensions of the symmetric part and antisymmetric part are D+1 and {D \choose 2}, respectively.
