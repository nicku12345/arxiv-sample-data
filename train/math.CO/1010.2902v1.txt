We study the Tutte polynomial of two infinite families of finite graphs. These are the Schreier graphs associated with the action of two well-known self-similar groups acting on the binary rooted tree by automorphisms: the first Grigorchuk group of intermediate growth, and the iterated monodromy group of the complex polynomial z^2-1 known as the Basilica group. For both of them, we describe the Tutte polynomial and we compute several special evaluations of it, giving further information about the combinatorial structure of these graphs.
