In this paper, we show how general determinants may be viewed as generating functions of nonintersecting lattice paths, using the Lindstr\"om-Gessel-Viennot interpretation of semistandard Young tableaux and the Jacobi-Trudi identity together with elementary observations. After some preparations, this point of view provides very simple "graphical proofs" for classical determinantal identities like the Cauchy--Binet formula, Dodgson's condensation formula, the Pl\"ucker relations and Laplace's expansion. Also, a determinantal identity generalizing Dodgson's condensation formula is presented, which might be new.
