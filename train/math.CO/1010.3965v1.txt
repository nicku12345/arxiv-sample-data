The existence of certain monomial hyperovals D(x^k) in the finite Desarguesian projective plane PG(2,q), q even, is related to the existence of points on certain projective plane curves g_k(x,y,z). Segre showed that some values of k (k=6 and 2^i) give rise to hyperovals in PG(2,q) for infinitely many q. Segre and Bartocci conjectured that these are the only values of k with this property. We prove this conjecture through the absolute irreducibility of the curves g_k.
