We give new bounds on the Erdos-Szekeres theorems for convex bodies of Bisztriczky and Fejes Toth and of Pach and Toth. We derive them from a combinatorial characterization of convex position of a family of planar convex bodies. This characterization confirms that the concept of Order Type for points can be extended to noncrossing families of convex bodies in a geometrically meaningful way.
