Let K_4^- denote the diamond graph, formed by removing an edge from the complete graph K_4. We consider the following random graph process: starting with n isolated vertices, add edges uniformly at random provided no such edge creates a copy of K_4^-. We show that, with probability tending to 1 as n \to \infty, the final size of the graph produced is \Theta(\sqrt{\log(n)} \cdot n^{3/2}). Our analysis also suggests that the graph produced after i edges are added resembles the random graph, with the additional condition that the edges which do not lie on triangles form a random-looking subgraph.
