Let \A be an irreducible Coxeter arrangement and \bfk be a multiplicity of \A. We study the derivation module D(\A, \bfk). Any two-dimensional irreducible Coxeter arrangement with even number of lines is decomposed into two orbits under the action of the Coxeter group. In this paper, we will {explicitly} construct a basis for D(\A, \bfk) assuming \bfk is constant on each orbit. Consequently we will determine the exponents of (\A, \bfk) under this assumption. For this purpose we develop a theory of universal derivations and introduce a map to deal with our exceptional cases.
