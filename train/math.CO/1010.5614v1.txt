A linear chord diagram canonically determines a fatgraph and hence has an associated genus g. We compute the natural generating function {\bf C}_g(z)=\sum_{n\geq 0} {\bf c}_g(n)z^n for the number {\bf c}_g(n) of linear chord diagrams of fixed genus g\geq 1 with a given number n\geq 0 of chords and find the remarkably simple formula {\bf C}_g(z)=z^{2g}R_g(z) (1-4z)^{{1\over 2}-3g}, where R_g(z) is a polynomial of degree at most g-1 with integral coefficients satisfying R_g({1\over 4})\neq 0 and R_g(0) = {\bf c}_g(2g)\neq 0. In particular, {\bf C}_g(z) is algebraic over \mathbb C(z), which generalizes the corresponding classical fact for the generating function {\bf C}_0(z) of the Catalan numbers. As a corollary, we also calculate a related generating function germaine to the enumeration of knotted RNA secondary structures, which is again found to be algebraic.
