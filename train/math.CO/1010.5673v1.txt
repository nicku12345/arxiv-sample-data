Let \C_n be the set of Dyck paths of length n. In this paper, by a new automorphism of ordered trees, we prove that the statistic `number of exterior pairs', introduced by A. Denise and R. Simion, on the set \C_n is equidistributed with the statistic `number of up steps at height h with h\equiv 0 (mod 3)'. Moreover, for m\ge 3, we prove that the two statistics `number of up steps at height h with h\equiv 0 (mod m)' and `number of up steps at height h with h\equiv m-1 (mod m)' on the set \C_n are `almost equidistributed'. Both results are proved combinatorially.
