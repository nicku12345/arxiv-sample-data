We prove game-theoretic versions of several classical results on nonrepetitive sequences, showing the existence of winning strategies using an extension of the Lov\'asz Local Lemma which can dramatically reduce the number of edges needed in a dependency graph when there is an ordering underlying the significant dependencies of events. This appears to represent the first successful application of a Local Lemma to games.
