Consider all possible ways of attaching disjoint chords to two ordered and oriented disjoint intervals so as to produce a connected graph. Taking the intervals to lie in the real axis with the induced orientation and the chords to lie in the upper half plane canonically determines a corresponding fatgraph which has some associated genus g\geq 0, and we consider the natural generating function {\bf C}_g^{[2]}(z)=\sum_{n\geq 0} {\bf c}^{[2]}_g(n)z^n for the number {\bf c}^{[2]}_g(n) of distinct such chord diagrams of fixed genus g\geq 0 with a given number n\geq 0 of chords. We prove here the surprising fact that {\bf C}^{[2]}_g(z)=z^{2g+1} R_g^{[2]}(z)/(1-4z)^{3g+2}  is a rational function, for g\geq 0, where the polynomial R^{[2]}_g(z) with degree at most g has integer coefficients and satisfies R_g^{[2]}({1\over 4})\neq 0. Earlier work had already determined that the analogous generating function {\bf C}_g(z)=z^{2g}R_g(z)/(1-4z)^{3g-{1\over 2}} for chords attached to a single interval is algebraic, for g\geq 1, where the polynomial R_g(z) with degree at most g-1 has integer coefficients and satisfies R_g(1/4)\neq 0 in analogy to the generating function {\bf C}_0(z) for the Catalan numbers. The new results here on {\bf C}_g^{[2]}(z) rely on this earlier work, and indeed, we find that R_g^{[2]}(z)=R_{g+1}(z) -z\sum_{g_1=1}^g R_{g_1}(z) R_{g+1-g_1}(z), for g\geq 1.
