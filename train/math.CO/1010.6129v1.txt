The energy of a simple graph G, denoted by E(G), is defined as the sum of the absolute values of all eigenvalues of its adjacency matrix. Denote by C_n the cycle, and P_n^{6} the unicyclic graph obtained by connecting a vertex of C_6 with a leaf of P_{n-6}\,. Caporossi et al. conjecture that the unicyclic graph with maximal energy is P_n^6 for n=8,12,14 and n\geq 16. In``Y. Hou, I. Gutman and C. Woo, Unicyclic graphs with maximal energy, {\it Linear Algebra Appl.} {\bf 356}(2002), 27--36", the authors proved that E(P_n^6) is maximal within the class of the unicyclic bipartite n-vertex graphs differing from C_n\,. And they also claimed that the energy of C_n and P_n^6 is quasi-order incomparable and left this as an open problem. In this paper, by utilizing the Coulson integral formula and some knowledge of real analysis, especially by employing certain combinatorial techniques, we show that the energy of P_n^6 is greater than that of C_n for n=8,12,14 and n\geq 16, which completely solves this open problem and partially solves the above conjecture.
