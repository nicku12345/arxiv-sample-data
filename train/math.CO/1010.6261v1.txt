Bouvel and Pergola introduced the notion of minimal permutations in the study of the whole genome duplication-random loss model for genome rearrangements. Let \mathcal{F}_d(n) denote the set of minimal permutations of length n with d descents, and let f_d(n)= |\mathcal{F}_d(n)|. They derived that f_{n-2}(n)=2^{n}-(n-1)n-2 and f_n(2n)=C_n, where C_n is the n-th Catalan number. Mansour and Yan proved that f_{n+1}(2n+1)=2^{n-2}nC_{n+1}. In this paper, we consider the problem of counting minimal permutations in \mathcal{F}_d(n) with a prescribed set of ascents. We show that such structures are in one-to-one correspondence with a class of skew Young tableaux, which we call 2-regular skew tableaux. Using the determinantal formula for the number of skew Young tableaux of a given shape, we find an explicit formula for f_{n-3}(n). Furthermore, by using the Knuth equivalence, we give a combinatorial interpretation of a formula for a refinement of the number f_{n+1}(2n+1).
