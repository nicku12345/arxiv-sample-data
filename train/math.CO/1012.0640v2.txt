We describe an inner product on the diagrams on which the Temperley-Lieb algebra can be represented. We exhibit several constructions which are in natural combinatorial bijection with these diagrams, which are generalizations of various constructions counted by the Catalan numbers. We use a method similar to the existing ones for orthogonalizing the Temperley-Lieb algebra to construct an orthogonal basis for the vector space over these diagrams.
