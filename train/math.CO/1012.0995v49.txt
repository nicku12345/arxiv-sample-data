The middle-levels graph M_k (0<k\in\mathbb{Z}) has a dihedral quotient pseudograph R_k whose vertices are the k-edge ordered trees T, each T encoded as a (2k+1)-string F(T) formed via \rightarrowDFS by: {\bf(i)} (\leftarrowBFS-assigned) Kierstead-Trotter lexical colors 0,\ldots,k for the descending nodes; {\bf(ii)} asterisks * for the k ascending edges. Two ways of corresponding a restricted-growth k-string \alpha to each T exist, namely one Stanley's way and a novel way that assigns F(T) to \alpha via nested substring-swaps. These swaps permit to sort V(R_k) as an ordered tree that allows a lexical visualization of M_k as well as the Hamilton cycles of M_k constructed by P. Gregor, T. M\"utze and J. Nummenpalo.
