The Tutte polynomial is a classical invariant, important in combinatorics and statistical mechanics. An essential feature of the Tutte polynomial is the duality for planar graphs G, T_G(X,Y)\; =\; {T}_{G^*}(Y,X) where G^* denotes the dual graph. We examine this property from the perspective of manifold topology, formulating polynomial invariants for higher-dimensional simplicial complexes. Polynomial duality for triangulations of a sphere follows as a consequence of Alexander duality.   The main goal of this paper is to introduce and begin the study of a more general 4-variable polynomial for triangulations and handle decompositions of orientable manifolds. Polynomial duality in this case is a consequence of Poincare duality on manifolds. In dimension 2 these invariants specialize to the well-known polynomial invariants of ribbon graphs defined by B. Bollobas and O. Riordan. Examples and specific evaluations of the polynomials are discussed.
