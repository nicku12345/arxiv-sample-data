We view the RSK correspondence as associating to each permutation \pi \in S_n a Young diagram \lambda=\lambda(\pi), i.e. a partition of n. Suppose now that \pi is left-multiplied by t transpositions, what is the largest number of cells in \lambda that can change as a result? It is natural refer to this question as the search for the Lipschitz constant of the RSK correspondence.   We show upper bounds on this Lipschitz constant as a function of t. For t=1, we give a construction of permutations that achieve this bound exactly. For larger t we construct permutations which come close to matching the upper bound that we prove.
