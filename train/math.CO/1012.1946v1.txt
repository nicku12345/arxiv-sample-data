A finite set X \seq \RR^n with a weight function w : X \longrightarrow \RR_{>0} is called \emph{Euclidean t-design} in \RR^n (supported by p concentric spheres) if the following condition holds: \[ \sum_{i=1}^p \frac{w(X_i)}{|S_i|}\int_{S_i} f(\boldsymbol x)d\sigma_i(\boldsymbol x) =\sum_{\boldsymbol x \in X}w(\boldsymbol x) f(\boldsymbol x), \] for any polynomial f(\boldsymbol x) \in \mbox{Pol}(\RR^n) of degree at most t. Here S_i \seq \RR^n is a sphere of radius r_i \geq 0, X_i=X \cap S_i, and \sigma_i(\boldsymbol x) is an O(n)-invariant measure on S_i such that |S_i|=r_i^{n-1}|S^{n-1}|, with |S_i| is the surface area of S_i and |S^{n-1}| is a surface area of the unit sphere in \RR^n.   Recently, Bajnok (2006) constructed tight Euclidean t-designs in the plane (n=2) for arbitrary t and p. In this paper we show that for case t=6 and p=2, tight Euclidean 6-designs constructed by Bajnok is the unique configuration in \RR^n, for 2 \leq n \leq 8.
