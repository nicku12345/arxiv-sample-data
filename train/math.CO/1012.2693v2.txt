For a graph G, Chartrand et al. defined the rainbow connection number rc(G) and the strong rainbow connection number src(G) in "G. Charand, G.L. John, K.A. Mckeon, P. Zhang, Rainbow connection in graphs, Mathematica Bohemica, 133(1)(2008) 85-98". They raised the following conjecture: for two given positive a and b, there exists a connected graph G such that rc(G)=a and src(G)=b if and only if a=b\in\{1,2\} or  3\leq a\leq b". In this short note, we will show that the conjecture is true.
