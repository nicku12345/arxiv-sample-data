Describing the combinatorial structure of the tropical complex C of a tropical matroid polytope, we obtain a formula for the coarse types of the maximal cells of C. Due to the connection between tropical complexes and resolutions of monomial ideals, this yields the generators for the corresponding coarse type ideal introduced in a recent paper of Dochtermann, Joswig and Sanyal (2010, preprint arXiv.org:1001.0237). Furthermore, a complete description of the minimal tropical halfspaces of the uniform tropical matroid polytopes, i.e. the tropical hypersimplices, is given.
