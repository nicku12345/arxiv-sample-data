Let \gamma_{a,b}(n) be the number of smooth words of length n over the alphabet \{a,b\} with a<b. Say that a smooth word w is \emph{left fully extendable} (LFE) if both aw and bw are smooth. In this paper, we prove that for any positive number \xi and positive integer n_{0} such that the proportion of b's is larger than \xi for each LFE word of length exceeding n_0, there are two constants c_{1}\,\textrm{and}\, c_{2} such that for each positive integer n, one has {eqnarray} c_{1}\cdot n^{\frac{\log (2b-1)}{\log (1+(a+b-2)(1-\xi))}}<\gamma_{a,b}(n)< c_2\cdot n^{\frac{\log (2b-1)}{\log (1+(a+b-2)\xi)}}. {eqnarray} In particular, taking a=1\text{and}b=2 in the above inequalities arrives at Huang and Weakley's result. Moreover, for 2-letter even alphabet \{a,b\}, there are two suitable constants c_1,\,c_2 such that \{eqnarray} c_{1}\cdot n^{\frac{\log (2b-1)}{\log ((a+b)/2)}}<\gamma_{a,b}(n)< c_2\cdot n^{\frac{\log (2b-1)}{\log ((a+b)/2)}}\textit{for each positive integer n}.\{eqnarray}
