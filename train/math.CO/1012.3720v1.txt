We study the area distribution of closed walks of length n, beginning and ending at the origin. The concept of area of a walk in the square lattice is generalized and the usefulness of the new concept is demonstrated through a simple argument. It is concluded that the number of walks of length n and area s equals to the coefficient of z^s in the expression (x+x^{-1}+y+y^{-1})^n, where the calculations are performed in a special group ring R[x,y,z]. A polynomial time algorithm for calculating these values, is then concluded. Finally, the provided algorithm and the results of implementation are compared with previous works.
