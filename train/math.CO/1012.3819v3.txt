In this paper, we describe a complete computer classification of the hemisystems in the two known flock generalized quadrangles of order (5^2,5) and give numerous further examples of hemisystems in all the known flock generalized quadrangles of order (s^2,s) for s \le 11. By analysing the computational data, we identify two possible new infinite families of hemisystems in the classical generalized quadrangle H(3,q^2).
