We provide a short combinatorial proof of Cayley's formula by means of a bijective map to an outcome space of an urn-drawing problem.   Furthermore we introduce an algebraic structure on the set of labeled trees, which provides a more standard approach to Cayley's formula. Moreover, this algebraic structure sheds light on the problem of counting the unlabeled trees. In particular, it indicates how counting the number of unlabeled trees on n vertices is connected to finding the number of partitions of n-2
