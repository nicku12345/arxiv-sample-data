In a directed multigraph, the imbalance of a vertex v_{i} is defined as b_{v_{i}}=d_{v_{i}}^{+}-d_{v_{i}}^{-}, where d_{v_{i}}^{+} and d_{v_{i}}^{-} denote the outdegree and indegree respectively of v_{i}. We characterize imbalances in directed multigraphs and obtain lower and upper bounds on imbalances in such digraphs. Also, we show the existence of a directed multigraph with a given imbalance set.
