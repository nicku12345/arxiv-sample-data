If w=u\alpha for \alpha\in \Sigma=\{1,2\} and u\in \Sigma^*, then w is said to be a \textit{simple right extension}of u and denoted by u\prec w. Let k be a positive integer and P^k(\epsilon) denote the set of all C^\infty-words of height k. Set u_{1},\,u_{2},..., u_{m}\in P^{k}(\epsilon), if u_{1}\prec u_{2}\prec ...\prec u_{m} and there is no element v of P^{k}(\epsilon) such that v\prec u_{1}\text{or} u_{m}\prec v, then u_{1}\prec u_{2}\prec...\prec u_{m} is said to be a \textit{maximal right smooth extension (MRSE) chains}of height k. In this paper, we show that \textit{MRSE} chains of height k constitutes a partition of smooth words of height k and give the formula of the number of \textit{MRSE} chains of height k for each positive integer k. Moreover, since there exist the minimal height h_1 and maximal height h_2 of smooth words of length n for each positive integer n, we find that \textit{MRSE} chains of heights h_1-1 and h_2+1 are good candidates to be used to establish the lower and upper bounds of the number of smooth words of length n respectively, which is simpler and more intuitionistic than the previous methods.
