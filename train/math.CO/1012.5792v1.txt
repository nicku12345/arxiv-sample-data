The Kelmans-Seymour conjecture states that the 5-connected nonplanar graphs contain a subdivided K_{_5}. Certain questions of Mader propose a "plan" towards a possible resolution of this conjecture. One part of this plan is to show that a 5-connected nonplanar graph containing K^-_{_4} or K_{_{2,3}} as a subgraph has a subdivided K_{_5}. Recently, Ma and Yu showed that a 5-connected nonplanar graph containing K^-_{_4} as a subgraph has a subdivided K_{_5}. We take interest in K_{_{2,3}} and prove that a 5-connected nonplanar apex graph containing K_{_{2,3}} as a subgraph has a subdivided K_{_5}
