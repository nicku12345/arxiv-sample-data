The energy of a simple graph G, denoted by E(G), is defined as the sum of the absolute values of all eigenvalues of its adjacency matrix. Let C_n denote the cycle of order n and P^{6,6}_n the graph obtained from joining two cycles C_6 by a path P_{n-12} with its two leaves. Let \mathscr{B}_n denote the class of all bipartite bicyclic graphs but not the graph R_{a,b}, which is obtained from joining two cycles C_a and C_b (a, b\geq 10 and a \equiv b\equiv 2\, (\,\textmd{mod}\, 4)) by an edge. In [I. Gutman, D. Vidovi\'{c}, Quest for molecular graphs with maximal energy: a computer experiment, {\it J. Chem. Inf. Sci.} {\bf41}(2001), 1002--1005], Gutman and Vidovi\'{c} conjectured that the bicyclic graph with maximal energy is P^{6,6}_n, for n=14 and n\geq 16. In [X. Li, J. Zhang, On bicyclic graphs with maximal energy, {\it Linear Algebra Appl.} {\bf427}(2007), 87--98], Li and Zhang showed that the conjecture is true for graphs in the class \mathscr{B}_n. However, they could not determine which of the two graphs R_{a,b} and P^{6,6}_n has the maximal value of energy. In [B. Furtula, S. Radenkovi\'{c}, I. Gutman, Bicyclic molecular graphs with the greatest energy, {\it J. Serb. Chem. Soc.} {\bf73(4)}(2008), 431--433], numerical computations up to a+b=50 were reported, supporting the conjecture. So, it is still necessary to have a mathematical proof to this conjecture. This paper is to show that the energy of P^{6,6}_n is larger than that of R_{a,b}, which proves the conjecture for bipartite bicyclic graphs. For non-bipartite bicyclic graphs, the conjecture is still open.
