Let n,r,k,s be positive integers with n,k\ge 2. The generalized Ramsey number R(n,r;k,s) is the smallest positive integer p such that for every graph G of order p, either G contains a subgraph induced by n vertices with at most r-1 edges, or the complement \bar G of G contains a subgraph induced by k vertices with at most s-1 edges. In this paper we completely determine R(n,n(n-1)/2-r;k,1) for n\ge 4 and r\le n-2, and pose several conjectures on Ramsey numbers.
