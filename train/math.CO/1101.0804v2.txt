This paper is the first application of the compensation approach to counting problems. We discuss how this method can be applied to a general class of walks in the quarter plane Z_{+}^{2} with a step set that is a subset of \{(-1,1),(-1,0),(-1,-1),(0,-1),(1,-1)\} in the interior of Z_{+}^{2}. We derive an explicit expression for the counting generating function, which turns out to be meromorphic and nonholonomic, can be easily inverted, and can be used to obtain asymptotic expressions for the counting coefficients.
