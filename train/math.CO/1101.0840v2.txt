For graphs G and H, an H-coloring of G is a function from the vertices of G to the vertices of H that preserves adjacency. H-colorings encode graph theory notions such as independent sets and proper colorings, and are a natural setting for the study of hard-constraint models in statistical physics.   We study the set of H-colorings of the even discrete torus {\mathbb Z}^d_m, the graph on vertex set {0, ..., m-1}^d (m even) with two strings adjacent if they differ by 1 (mod m) on one coordinate and agree on all others. This is a bipartite graph, with bipartition classes {\mathcal E} and {\mathcal O}. In the case m=2 the even discrete torus is the discrete hypercube or Hamming cube Q_d, the usual nearest neighbor graph on {0,1}^d.   We obtain, for any H and fixed m, a structural characterization of the space of H-colorings of {\mathbb Z}^d_m. We show that it may be partitioned into an exceptional subset of negligible size (as d grows) and a collection of subsets indexed by certain pairs (A,B) \in V(H)^2, with each H-coloring in the subset indexed by (A,B) having all but a vanishing proportion of vertices from {\mathcal E} mapped to vertices from A, and all but a vanishing proportion of vertices from {\mathcal O} mapped to vertices from B. This implies a long-range correlation phenomenon for uniformly chosen H-colorings of {\mathbb Z}^d_m with m fixed and d growing.   Our proof proceeds through an analysis of the entropy of a uniformly chosen H-coloring, and extends an approach of Kahn, who had considered the special case of m=2 and H a doubly infinite path. All our results generalize to a natural weighted model of H-colorings.
