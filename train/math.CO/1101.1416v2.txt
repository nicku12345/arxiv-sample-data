We refine Catalan numbers and Fu{\ss}-Catalan numbers by introducing colour statistics for triangulations of polygons and d-dimensional generalisations there-of which we call Fu{\ss}-Catalan complexes. Our refinements consist in showing that the number of triangulations, respectively Fu{\ss}-Catalan complexes, with a given colour distribution of its vertices is given by closed product formulae. The crucial ingredient in the proof is the Lagrange-Good inversion formula.
