We deliver here second new \textit{H(x)}-binomials' recurrence formula, were H(x)-binomials'  array is appointed by Ward-Horadam sequence of functions which in predominantly considered cases where chosen to be polynomials . Secondly, we supply a review of selected related combinatorial interpretations of generalized binomial coefficients. We then propose also a kind of transfer of interpretation of p,q-binomial  coefficients onto q-binomial coefficients interpretations thus bringing us back to Gy{\"{o}}rgy P\'olya  and Donald Ervin Knuth relevant investigation decades ago.
