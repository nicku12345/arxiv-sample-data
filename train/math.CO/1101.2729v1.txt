We settle affirmatively a conjecture posed in [S. M. Hegde, Set colorings of graphs, European Journal of Combinatorics 30 (4) (2009), 986--995]: If some subsets of a set X are assigned injectively to all vertices of a complete bipartite graph G such that the collection of all sets, each of which is the symmetric difference of the sets assigned to the ends of some edge, is the set of all nonempty subsets of X, then G is a star.
