We prove a determinantal identity concerning Schur functions for 2-staircase diagrams lambda=(ln+l',ln,l(n-1)+l',l(n-1),...,l+l',l,l',0). When l=1 and l'=0 these functions are related to the partition function of the 6-vertex model at the combinatorial point and hence to enumerations of Alternating Sign Matrices. A consequence of our result is an identity concerning the doubly-refined enumerations of Alternating Sign Matrices.
