Let G be a nontrivial connected graph of order n and k an integer with 2\leq k\leq n. For a set S of k vertices of G, let \kappa (S) denote the maximum number \ell of edge-disjoint trees T_1,T_2,...,T_\ell in G such that V(T_i)\cap V(T_j)=S for every pair i,j of distinct integers with 1\leq i,j\leq \ell. Chartrand et al. generalized the concept of connectivity as follows: The k-connectivity, denoted by \kappa_k(G), of G is defined by \kappa_k(G)=min\{\kappa(S)\}, where the minimum is taken over all k-subsets S of V(G). Thus \kappa_2(G)=\kappa(G), where \kappa(G) is the connectivity of G.   This paper mainly focuses on the minimal number of edges of a graph G with \kappa_{3}(G)= 2. For a graph G of order v(G) and size e(G) with \kappa_{3}(G)= 2, we obtain that e(G)\geq 6/5v(G), and the lower bound is sharp by showing a class of examples attaining the lower bound.
