For a connected graph, the distance spectral radius is the largest eigenvalue of its distance matrix, and the distance energy is defined as the sum of the absolute values of the eigenvalues of its distance matrix. We establish lower and upper bounds for the distance spectral radius of graphs and bipartite graphs, lower bounds for the distance energy of graphs, and characterize the extremal graphs. We also discuss upper bounds for the distance energy.
