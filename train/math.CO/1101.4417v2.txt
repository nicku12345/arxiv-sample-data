We construct dense, triangle-free, chromatic-critical graphs of chromatic number k for all k\geq 4. For k\geq 6 our constructions have > (\frac{1}{4} -\varepsilon)n^2 edges, which is asymptotically best possible by Tur\'an's theorem. We also demonstrate (nonconstructively) the existence of dense k-critical graphs avoiding all odd cycles of length \leq \ell for any \ell and any k\geq 4, again with a best possible density of >(\frac{1}{4} -\varepsilon)n^2 edges for k\geq 6. The families of graphs without triangles or of given odd-girth are thus rare examples where we know the correct maximal density of k-critical members (k\geq 6).
