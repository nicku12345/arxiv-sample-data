By adapting the notion of chirality group, the duality group of \cal H can be defined as the the minimal subgroup D({\cal H}) \trianglelefteq Mon({\cal H}) such that {\cal H}/D({\cal H}) is a self-dual hypermap (a hypermap isomorphic to its dual). Here, we prove that for any positive integer d, we can find a hypermap of that duality index (the order of D({\cal H})), even when some restrictions apply, and also that, for any positive integer k, we can find a non self-dual hypermap such that |Mon({\cal H})|/d=k. This k will be called the \emph{duality coindex} of the hypermap.
