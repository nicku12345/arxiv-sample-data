In this paper, we extend recent results of Assaf and McNamara on skew Pieri rule and skew Murnaghan-Nakayama rule to a more general identity, which gives an elegant expansion of the product of a skew Schur function with a quantum power sum function in terms of skew Schur functions. We give two proofs, one completely bijective in the spirit of Assaf-McNamara's original proof, and one via Lam-Lauve-Sotille's skew Littlewood-Richardson rule. We end with some conjectures for skew rules for Hall-Littlewood polynomials.
