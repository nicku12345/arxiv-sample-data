We give a solution of the following combinatorial problem: "Let one from n married couples in the m\'enage problem (see Problem 1) be a couple of a known mathematician M and his wife. After the ladies are seated at every other chair, M (in token of respect) is the first man allowed to choose one of the remaining chairs. To find the number of ways of seating the other men, with no man seated next to his wife, if M chooses the chair that is d seats clockwise from his wife's chair."
