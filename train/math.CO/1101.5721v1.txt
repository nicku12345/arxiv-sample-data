We give a randomized algorithm that properly colors the vertices of a triangle-free graph G on n vertices using O(\Delta(G)/ log \Delta(G)) colors, where \Delta(G) is the maximum degree of G. The algorithm takes O(n\Delta2(G)log\Delta(G)) time and succeeds with high probability, provided \Delta(G) is greater than log^{1+{\epsilon}}n for a positive constant {\epsilon}. The number of colors is best possible up to a constant factor for triangle-free graphs. As a result this gives an algorithmic proof for a sharp upper bound of the chromatic number of a triangle-free graph, the existence of which was previously established by Kim and Johansson respectively.
