A graph G is called H-saturated if it does not contain any copy of H, but for any edge e in the complement of G the graph G+e contains some H. The minimum size of an n-vertex H-saturated graph is denoted by \sat(n,H). We prove \sat(n,C_k) = n + n/k + O((n/k^2) + k^2) holds for all n\geq k\geq 3, where C_k is a cycle with length k. We have a similar result for semi-saturated graphs \ssat(n,C_k) = n + n/(2k) + O((n/k^2) + k). We conjecture that our three constructions are optimal.
