Pattern avoidance in the symmetric group S_n has provided a number of useful connections between seemingly unrelated problems from stack-sorting to Schubert varieties. Recent work has generalized these results to S_n\wr C_c, the objects of which can be viewed as "colored permutations".   Another body of research that has grown from the study of pattern avoidance in permutations is pattern avoidance in \Pi_n, the set of set partitions of [n]. Pattern avoidance in set partitions is a generalization of the well-studied notion of noncrossing partitions.   Motivated by recent results in pattern avoidance in S_n \wr C_c we provide a catalog of initial results for pattern avoidance in colored partitions, \Pi_n \wr C_c. We note that colored set partitions are not a completely new concept. \emph{Signed} (2-colored) set partitions appear in the work of Bj\"{o}rner and Wachs involving the homology of partition lattices. However, we seek to study these objects in a new enumerative context.
