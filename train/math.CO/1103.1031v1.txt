A {\it vector space partition} is here a collection \mathcal P of subspaces of a finite vector space V(n,q), of dimension n over a finite field with q elements, with the property that every non zero vector is contained in a unique member of \mathcal P. Vector space partitions relates to finite projective planes, design theory and error correcting codes.   In the first part of the talk I will discuss some relations between vector space partitions and other branches of mathematics. The other part of the talk contains a survey of known results on the type of a vector space partition, more precisely: the theorem of Beutelspacher and Heden on \mathrm{T}-partitions, rather recent results of El-Zanati et al. on the different types that appear in the spaces V(n,2), for n\leq8, a result of Heden and Lehmann on vector space partitions and maximal partial spreads including their new necessary condition for the existence of a vector space partition, and furthermore, I will give a theorem of Heden on the length of the tail of a vector space partition.   Finally, I will also give a few historical remarks.
