The shard intersection order is a new lattice structure on a finite Coxeter group W which encodes the geometry of the reflection arrangement and the lattice theory of the weak order. In the case where W is the symmetric group, we characterize shard intersections as certain pre-orders which we call permutation pre-orders. We use this combinatorial characterization to determine properties of the shard intersection order. In particular, we give an EL-labeling.
