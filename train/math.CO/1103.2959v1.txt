For a matroid M, an element e such that both M\backslash e and M/e are regular is called a regular element of M. We determine completely the structure of non-regular matroids with at least two regular elements. Besides four small size matroids, all 3-connected matroids in the class can be pieced together from F_7 or S_8 and a regular matroid using 3-sums. This result takes a step toward solving a problem posed by Paul Seymour: Find all 3-connected non-regular matroids with at least one regular element [5, 14.8.8].
