Factor complexity \mathcal{C} and palindromic complexity \mathcal{P} of infinite words with language closed under reversal are known to be related by the inequality \mathcal{P}(n) + \mathcal{P}(n+1) \leq 2 + \mathcal{C}(n+1)-\mathcal{C}(n) for any n\in \mathbb{N}\,. Word for which the equality is attained for any n is usually called rich in palindromes. In this article we study words whose languages are invariant under a finite group G of symmetries. For such words we prove a stronger version of the above inequality. We introduce notion of G-palindromic richness and give several examples of G-rich words, including the Thue-Morse sequence as well.
