Philip Matchett Wood and Doron Zeilberger have constructed identities for the Fibonacci numbers f_n of the form 1f_n = f_n for all n \geq 1; 2f_n = f_{n-2} + f_{n+1} for all n \geq 3; 3f_n = f_{n-2} + f_{n+2} for all n \geq 3; 4f_n = f_{n-2} + f_{n} + f_{n+2} for all n \geq 3; ...; the general identity in this family has the form kf_n = \sum_{s \in S_k} f_{n+s} (for all sufficiently high n), where S_k is a finite set of integers that depends only on k and contains no two consecutive integers. These identities are generalized, replacing the left-hand side kf_n by arbitrary sums of the form f_{n+a_1} + f_{n+a_2} + \cdots + f_{n+a_p} for arbitrary integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_p. The resulting theorem is proved using the connection between the Fibonacci numbers and the golden ratio.
