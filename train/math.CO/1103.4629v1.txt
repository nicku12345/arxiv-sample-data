We obtain new bounds for the Laplacian spectral radius of a signed graph. Most of these new bounds have a dependence on edge sign, unlike previously known bounds, which only depend on the underlying structure of the graph. We then use some of these bounds to obtain new bounds for the Laplacian and signless Laplacian spectral radius of an unsigned graph by signing the edges all positive and all negative, respectively.
