A lonesum matrix is a matrix that can be uniquely reconstructed from its row and column sums. Kaneko defined the poly-Bernoulli numbers B_m^{(n)} by a generating function, and Brewbaker computed the number of binary lonesum m\times n-matrices and showed that this number coincides with the poly-Bernoulli number B_m^{(-n)}. We compute the number of q-ary lonesum m\times n-matrices, and then provide generalized Kaneko's formulas by using the generating function for the number of q-ary lonesum m\times n-matrices. In addition, we define two types of q-ary lonesum matrices that are composed of strong and weak lonesum matrices, and suggest further researches on lonesum matrices. \
