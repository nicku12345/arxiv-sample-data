We consider a self-convolutive recurrence whose solution is the sequence of coefficients in the asymptotic expansion of the logarithmic derivative of the confluent hypergeometic function U(a,b,z). By application of the Hilbert transform we convert this expression into an explicit, non-recursive solution in which the nth coefficient is expressed as the (n-1)th moment of a measure, and also as the trace of the (n-1)th iterate of a linear operator. Applications of these sequences, and hence of the explicit solution provided, are found in quantum field theory as the number of Feynman diagrams of a certain type and order, in Brownian motion theory, and in combinatorics.
