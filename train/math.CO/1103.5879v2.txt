We use the classical umbral calculus to describe Riordan arrays. Here, a Riordan array is generated by a pair of umbrae, and this provides efficient proofs of several basic results of the theory such as the multiplication rule, the recursive properties, the fundamental theorem and the connection with Sheffer sequences. In particular, we show that the fundamental theorem turns out to be a reformulation of the umbral Abel identity. As an application, we give an elementary approach to the problem of extending integer powers of Riordan arrays to complex powers in such a way that additivity of the exponents is preserved. Also, ordinary Riordan arrays are studied within the classical umbral perspective and some combinatorial identities are discussed regarding Catalan numbers, Fibonacci numbers and Chebyshev polynomials.
