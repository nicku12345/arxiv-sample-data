This short article, dedicated to our beloved guru Philippe FLAJOLET (1948-2011), is a case-study in computer-generated combinatorial research, where the computer, all by itself, is using the transfer-matrix method to derive (rigorously!) rational generating functions for chromatic polynomials for infinite sequences of graphs generalizing the action of taking the Cartesian product with a path of length n, n=1,2,... .
