Let S be an orthogonal array OA(d,k) and let c be an r--coloring of its ground set X. We give a combinatorial identity which relates the number of vectors in S with given color patterns under c with the cardinalities of the color classes. Several applications of the identity are considered. Among them, we show that every equitable r--coloring of the integer interval [1,n] has at least 1/2(n/r)^2+O(n) monochromatic Schur triples. We also show that in an orthogonal array OA(d,d-1), the number of monochromatic vectors of each color depends only on the number of vectors which miss that color and the cardinality of the color class.
