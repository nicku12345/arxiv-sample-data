A \emph{gerechte framework} is a partition of an n \times n array into n regions of n cells each. A \emph{realization} of a gerechte framework is a latin square of order n with the property that when its cells are partitioned by the framework, each region contains exactly one copy of each symbol. A \emph{gerechte design} is a gerechte framework together with a realization.   We investigate gerechte frameworks where each region is a rectangle. It seems plausible that all such frameworks have realizations, and we present some progress towards answering this question. In particular, we show that for all positive integers s and t, any gerechte framework where each region is either an s \times t rectangle or a t\times s rectangle is realizable.
