We discuss counting problems linked to finite versions of Cantor's diagonal of infinite tableaux. We extend previous results of [2] by refining an equivalence relation that reduces significantly the exhaustive generation. New enumerative results follow and allow to look at the sub-class of the so- called bi-Cantorian tableaux. We conclude with a correspondence between Cantorian-type tableaux and coloring of hypergraphs having a square number of vertices.
