The concept of gcd-graphs is introduced by Klotz and Sander, which arises as a generalization of unitary Cayley graphs. The gcd-graph X_n (d_1,...,d_k) has vertices 0,1,...,n-1, and two vertices x and y are adjacent iff \gcd(x-y,n)\in D = \{d_1,d_2,...,d_k\}. These graphs are exactly the same as circulant graphs with integral eigenvalues characterized by So. In this paper we deal with the clique number of integral circulant graphs and investigate the conjecture proposed in \cite{klotz07} that clique number divides the number of vertices in the graph X_n (D). We completely solve the problem of finding clique number for integral circulant graphs with exactly one and two divisors. For k \geqslant 3, we construct a family of counterexamples and disprove the conjecture in this case.
