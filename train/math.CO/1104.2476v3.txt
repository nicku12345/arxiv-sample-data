We prove that the generalized Thue-Morse word \mathbf{t}_{b,m} defined for b \geq 2 and m \geq 1 as \mathbf{t}_{b,m} = (s_b(n) \mod m)_{n=0}^{+\infty}, where s_b(n) denotes the sum of digits in the base-b representation of the integer n, has its language closed under all elements of a group D_m isomorphic to the dihedral group of order 2m consisting of morphisms and antimorphisms. Considering simultaneously antimorphisms \Theta \in D_m, we show that \mathbf{t}_{b,m} is saturated by \Theta-palindromes up to the highest possible level. Using the terminology generalizing the notion of palindromic richness for more antimorphisms recently introduced by the author and E. Pelantov\'a, we show that \mathbf{t}_{b,m} is D_m-rich. We also calculate the factor complexity of \mathbf{t}_{b,m}.
