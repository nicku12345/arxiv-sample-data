Let \Lambda_n^k denote the class of (0,1) square matrices containing in each row and in each column exactly k 1's. The minimal value of k, for which the behavior of the permanent in \Lambda_n^k is not quite studied, is k=3. We give a simple algorithm for calculation upper magnitudes of permanent in \Lambda_n^3 and consider some extremal problems in a generalized class \Lambda_n(\alpha,\beta,\gamma), the matrices of which contain in each row and in each column nonzero elements \alpha,\beta,\gamma and n-3 zeros.
