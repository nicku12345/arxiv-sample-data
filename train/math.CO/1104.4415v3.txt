A graph G=(V,E) is d-sparse if each subset X\subseteq V with |X|\geq d induces at most d|X|-{{d+1}\choose{2}} edges in G. Maxwell showed in 1864 that a necessary condition for a generic bar-and-joint framework with at least d+1 vertices to be rigid in {\mathbb R}^d is that G should have a d-sparse subgraph with d|X|-{{d+1}\choose{2}} edges. This necessary condition is also sufficient when d=1,2 but not when d\geq 3. Cheng and Sitharam strengthened Maxwell's condition by showing that every maximal d-sparse subgraph of G should have d|X|-{{d+1}\choose{2}} edges when d=3. We extend their result to all d\leq 11.
