We consider the Ehrhart h^*-vector for the hypersimplex. It is well-known that the sum of the h_i^* is the normalized volume which equals an Eulerian numbers. The main result is a proof of a conjecture by R. Stanley which gives an interpretation of the h^*_i coefficients in terms of descents and excedances. Our proof is geometric using a careful book-keeping of a shelling of a unimodular triangulation. We generalize this result to other closely related polytopes.
