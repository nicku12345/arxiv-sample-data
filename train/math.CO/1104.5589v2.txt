We consider the reconstruction of a function on a finite subset of \mathbb{Z}^2 if the line sums in certain directions are prescribed. The real solutions form a linear manifold, its integer solutions a grid. First we provide an explicit expression for the projection vector from the origin onto the linear solution manifold in the case of only row and column sums of a finite subset of \mathbf{Z}^2. Next we present a method to estimate the maximal distance between two binary solutions. Subsequently we deduce an upper bound for the distance from any given real solution to the nearest integer solution. This enables us to estimate the stability of solutions. Finally we generalize the first mentioned result to the torus case and to the continuous case.
