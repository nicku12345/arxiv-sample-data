A graph H is called common if the total number of copies of H in every graph and its complement asymptotically minimizes for random graphs. A former conjecture of Burr and Rosta, extending a conjecture of Erdos asserted that every graph is common. Thomason disproved both conjectures by showing that the complete graph of order four is not common. It is now known that in fact the common graphs are very rare. Answering a question of Sidorenko and of Jagger, Stovicek and Thomason from 1996 we show that the 5-wheel is common. This provides the first example of a common graph that is not three-colorable.
