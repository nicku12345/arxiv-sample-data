Let G be a connected graph. The notion \emph{the rainbow connection number rc(G)} of a graph G was introduced recently by Chartrand et al. Basavaraju et al. showed that for every bridgeless graph G with radius r, rc(G)\leq r(r+2), and the bound is tight. In this paper, we prove that if G is a connected graph, and D^{k} is a connected k-step dominating set of G, then G has a connected (k-1)-step dominating set D^{k-1}\supset D^{k} such that rc(G[D^{k-1}])\leq rc(G[D^{k}])+\max\{2k+1,b_k\}, where b_k is the number of bridges in  E(D^{k}, N(D^{k})). Furthermore, for a connected graph G with radius r, let u be the center of G, and D^{r}=\{u\}. Then G has r-1 connected dominating sets  D^{r-1}, D^{r-2},..., D^{1} satisfying D^{r}\subset D^{r-1}\subset D^{r-2} ...\subset D^{1}\subset D^{0}=V(G), and rc(G)\leq \sum_{i=1}^{r}\max\{2i+1,b_i\}, where b_i is the number of bridges in  E(D^{i}, N(D^{i})), 1\leq i \leq r. From the result, we can get that if for all 1\leq i\leq r, b_i\leq 2i+1, then rc(G)\leq \sum_{i=1}^{r}(2i+1)= r(r+2); if for all 1\leq i\leq r, b_i> 2i+1, then rc(G)= \sum_{i=1}^{r}b_i, the number of bridges of G. This generalizes the result of Basavaraju et al.
