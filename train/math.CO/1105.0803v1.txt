For a vector space V the \emph{intersection graph of subspaces} of V, denoted by G(V), is the graph whose vertices are in a one-to-one correspondence with proper nontrivial subspaces of V and two distinct vertices are adjacent if and only if the corresponding subspaces of V have a nontrivial (nonzero) intersection. In this paper, we study the clique number, the chromatic number, the domination number and the independence number of the intersection graphs of subspaces of a vector space.
