It is well-known that many famous pooling designs are constructed from mathematical structures by the "containment matrix" method. In this paper, we propose another method and obtain a family of pooling designs with surprisingly high degree of error correction based on a finite set. Given the numbers of items and pools, the error-tolerant property of our designs is much better than that of Macula's designs when the size of the set is large enough.
