Let X be a v-set, \B a set of 3-subsets (triples) of X, and \B^+\cup\B^- a partition of \B with |\B^-|=s. The pair (X,\B) is called a simple signed Steiner triple system, denoted by ST(v,s), if the number of occurrences of every 2-subset of X in triples B\in\B^+ is one more than the number of occurrences in triples B\in\B^-. In this paper we prove that \st(v,s) exists if and only if v\equiv1,3\pmod6, v\ne7, and s\in\{0,1,...,s_v-6,s_v-4,s_v\}, where s_v=v(v-1)(v-3)/12 and for v=7, s\in\{0,2,3,5,6,8,14\}.
