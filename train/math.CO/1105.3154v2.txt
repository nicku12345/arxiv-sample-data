As well known, permanent of a square (0,1)-matrix A of order n enumerates the permutations \beta of 1,2,...,n with the incidence matrices B\leq A. To obtain enumerative information on even and odd permutations with condition B\leq A, we should calculate two-fold vector (a_1,a_2) with a_1+a_2 =per A. More general, the introduced \omega-permanent, where \omega=e^{2\pi i/m}, we calculate as m-fold vector. For these and other matrix functions we generalize the Laplace theorem of their expansion over elements of the first row, using the defined so-called "combinatorial minors". In particular, in this way, we calculate the cycle index of permutations with condition B\leq A.
