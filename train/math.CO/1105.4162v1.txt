For each proper minor-closed subclass \cM of the \GF(q^2)-representable matroids containing all simple \GF(q)-representable matroids, we give, for all large r, a tight upper bound on the number of points in a rank-r matroid in \cM, and construct a rank-r matroid in \cM for which equality holds. As a consequence, we give a tight upper bound on the number of points in a \GF(q^2)-representable, rank-r matroid with no \PG(k,q^2)-minor.
