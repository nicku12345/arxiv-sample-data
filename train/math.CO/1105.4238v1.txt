As one of the serial papers on suborbits of point stabilizers in classical groups on the last subconstituent of dual polar graphs, the corresponding problem for orthogonal dual polar graphs over a finite field of odd characteristic is discussed in this paper. We determine all the suborbits of a point-stabilizer in the orthogonal group on the last subconstituent, and calculate the length of each suborbit. Moreover, we discuss the quasi-strongly regular graphs and the association schemes based on the last subconstituent, respectively.
