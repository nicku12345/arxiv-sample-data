In this paper, we give infinitely many examples of (non-isomorphic) connected k-regular graphs with smallest eigenvalue in half open interval [-1-\sqrt2, -2) and also infinitely many examples of (non-isomorphic) connected k-regular graphs with smallest eigenvalue in half open interval [\alpha_1, -1-\sqrt2) where \alpha_1 is the smallest root(\approx -2.4812) of the polynomial x^3+2x^2-2x-2. From these results, we determine the largest and second largest limit points of smallest eigenvalues of regular graphs less than -2. Moreover we determine the supremum of the smallest eigenvalue among all connected 3-regular graphs with smallest eigenvalue less than -2 and we give the unique graph with this supremum value as its smallest eigenvalue.
