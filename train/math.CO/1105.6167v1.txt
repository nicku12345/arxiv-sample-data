We find a set of necessary and sufficient conditions under which the weight w:E\to\mathbb R^+ on the graph G=(V,E) can be extended to a pseudometric d:V\times V\to\mathbb R^+. If these conditions hold and G is a connected graph, then the set \mathfrak M_w of all such extensions is nonvoid and the shortest-path pseudometric d_w is the greatest element of \mathfrak M_w with respect to the partial ordering d_1 \leqslant d_2 if and only if d_1(u,v) \leqslant d_2(u,v) for all u,v\in V. It is shown that every nonvoid poset (\mathfrak M_w,\leqslant) contains the least element \rho_{0,w} if and only if G is a complete k-partite graph with k\geqslant 2 and in this case the explicit formula for computation of \rho_{0,w} is obtained.
