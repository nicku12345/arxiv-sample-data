In this note we give a new upper bound for the Laplacian eigenvalues of an unweighted graph. Let G be a simple graph on n vertices. Let d_{m}(G) and \lambda_{m+1}(G) be the m-th smallest degree of G and the m+1-th smallest Laplacian eigenvalue of G respectively. Then  \lambda_{m+1}(G)\leq d_{m}(G)+m-1  for \bar{G} \neq K_{m}+(n-m)K_1 . We also introduce upper and lower bound for the Laplacian eigenvalues of weighted graphs, and compare it with the special case of unweighted graphs.
