We show that for a graph G with the vertex set V and the largest eigenvalue \lambda_{\max}(G), letting    M(G) := \max_{X,Y \subset V} \frac{e(X,Y)}{\sqrt{|X||Y|}}  (where e(X,Y) denotes the number of edges between X and Y), we have    M(G) \le \lambda_{\max}(G) \le \big(\frac14 \log|V| + 1 \big) \M(G).  Here the lower bound is attained if G is regular or bi-regular, whereas the logarithmic factor in the upper bound, conjecturally, can be improved --- although we present an example showing that it cannot be replaced with a factor growing slower than (\log |V|/\log\log|V|)^{1/8}.   Further refinements are established, particularly in the case where G is bipartite.
