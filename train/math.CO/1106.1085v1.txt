Let G be a graph with vertex set V(G) and edge set E(G), and f be a 0-1 labeling of E(G) so that the absolute difference in the number of edges labeled 1 and 0 is no more than one. Call such a labeling f \emph{edge-friendly}. The \emph{edge-balanced index set} of the graph G, EBI(G), is defined as the absolute difference between the number of vertices incident to more edges labeled 1 and the number of vertices incident to more edges labeled 0 over all edge-friendly labelings f. In 2009, Lee, Kong, and Wang \cite{LeeKongWang} found the EBI(K_{l,n}) for l=1,2,3,4,5 as well as l=n. We continue the investigation of the EBI of complete bipartite graphs of other orders.
