In (arXiv:1004.4127) the concept of down-link from a (K_v, G)-design B to a (K_n, G')-design B' has been introduced. In the present paper the spectrum problems for G'= P4 are studied. General results on the existence of path-decompositions and embeddings between path- decompositions playing a fundamental role for the construction of down-links are also presented
