Let G_1 and G_2 be disjoint copies of a graph G, and let f: V(G_1) \rightarrow V(G_2) be a function. Then a \emph{functigraph} C(G, f)=(V, E) has the vertex set V=V(G_1) \cup V(G_2) and the edge set E=E(G_1) \cup E(G_2) \cup \{uv \mid u \in V(G_1), v \in V(G_2), v=f(u)\}. A functigraph is a generalization of a \emph{permutation graph} (also known as a \emph{generalized prism}) in the sense of Chartrand and Harary. In this paper, we study domination in functigraphs. Let \gamma(G) denote the domination number of G. It is readily seen that \gamma(G) \le \gamma(C(G,f)) \le 2 \gamma(G). We investigate for graphs generally, and for cycles in great detail, the functions which achieve the upper and lower bounds, as well as the realization of the intermediate values.
