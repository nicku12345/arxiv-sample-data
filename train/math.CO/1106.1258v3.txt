Let G be a connected graph. The \emph{rainbow connection number rc(G)} of a graph G was recently introduced by Chartrand et al. Li et al. proved that for every bridgeless graph G with diameter 2, rc(G)\leq 5. They gave examples for which rc(G)\leq 4. However, they could not show that the upper bound 5 is sharp. It is known that for a graph G with diameter 2, to determine rc(G) is NP-hard. So, it is interesting to know the best upper bound of rc(G) for such a graph G. In this paper, we use different way to obtain the same upper bound, and moreover, examples are given to show that the upper is best possible.
