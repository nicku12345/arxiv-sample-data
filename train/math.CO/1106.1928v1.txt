In this paper we prove instances of the cyclic sieving phenomenon for finite Grassmannians and partial flag varieties, which carry the action of various tori in the finite general linear group GL_n(F_q). The polynomials involved are sums of certain weights of the minimal length parabolic coset representatives of the symmetric group S_n, where the weight of a coset representative can be written as a product over its inversions.
