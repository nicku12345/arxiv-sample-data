We investigate the nilpotence of a kind of circulant matrices T_{n,m} over field Z_p where T_{n,m}= \sum_{i = 0}^{m - 1} {S_n^i} and S_n is the fundamental circulant matrix of order n. The necessary and sufficient condition on n and m for determining nilpotence of T_{n,m} over Z_p is presented. Moreover, we obtain a formula for nilpotent index of T_{n,m} when the condition is satisfied. As an application, we give a complete solution of a conjecture of C.Y.Zhang.
