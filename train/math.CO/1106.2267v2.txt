A corollary of Kneser's theorem, one sees that any finite non-empty subset A of an abelian group G = (G,+) with |A + A| \leq (2-\eps) |A| can be covered by at most \frac{2}{\eps}-1 translates of a finite group H of cardinality at most (2-\eps)|A|. Using some arguments of Hamidoune, we establish an analogue in the noncommutative setting. Namely, if A is a finite non-empty subset of a nonabelian group G = (G,\cdot) such that |A \cdot A| \leq (2-\eps) |A|, then A is either contained in a right-coset of a finite group H of cardinality at most \frac{2}{\eps}|A|, or can be covered by at most \frac{2}{\eps}-1 right-cosets of a finite group H of cardinality at most |A|. We also note some connections with some recent work of Sanders and of Petridis.
