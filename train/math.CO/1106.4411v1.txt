The concept of generalized k-connectivity \kappa_{k}(G) of a graph G was introduced by Chartrand et al. in recent years. In our early paper, extremal theory for this graph parameter was started. We determined the minimal number of edges of a graph of order n with \kappa_{3}= 2, i.e., for a graph G of order n and size e(G) with \kappa_{3}(G)= 2, we proved that e(G)\geq (6/5)n, and the lower bound is sharp by constructing a class of graphs, only for n\equiv 0 \ (mod \ 5) and n\neq 10. In this paper, we improve the lower bound to \lceil(6/5)n\rceil. Moreover, we show that for all n\geq 4 but n= 9, 10, there always exists a graph of order n with \kappa_{3}= 2 whose size attains the lower bound \lceil(6/5)n\rceil. Whereas for n= 9, 10 we give examples to show that \lceil(6/5)n\rceil+1 is the best possible lower bound. This gives a clear picture on the minimal size of a graph of order n with generalized connectivity \kappa_{3}= 2.
