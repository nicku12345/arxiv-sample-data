This paper studies Zeilberger's two prized constant term identities. For one of the identities, Zeilberger asked for a simple proof that may give rise to a simple proof of Andrews theorem for the number of totally symmetric self complementary plane partitions. We obtain an identity reducing a constant term in 2k variables to a constant term in k variables. As applications, Zeilberger's constant terms are converted to single determinants. The result extends for two classes of matrices, the sum of all of whose full rank minors is converted to a single determinant. One of the prized constant term problems is solved, and we give a seemingly new approach to Macdonald's constant term for root system of type BC.
