This note contains two results on the distribution of crossing numbers and nesting numbers in permutations of type B. More precisely, we prove a Bn- analogue of the symmetric distribution of crossings and nestings of permutations due to Corteel (Adv. in Appl. Math., 38(2)(2007), 149-163) as well as the sym- metric distribution of k-crossings and k-nestings of permutations due to Burrill et al. (DMTCS proc. AN, (2010), 461-468).
