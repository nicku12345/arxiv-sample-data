Let \Pi be a polar space of type \textsf{D}_{n}. Denote by {\mathcal G}_{\delta}(\Pi), \delta\in \{+,-\} the associated half-spin Grassmannians and write \Gamma_{\delta}(\Pi) for the corresponding half-spin Grassmann graphs. In the case when n\ge 4 is even, the apartments of {\mathcal G}_{\delta}(\Pi) will be characterized as the images of isometric embeddings of the half-cube graph \frac{1}{2}H_n in \Gamma_{\delta}(\Pi). As an application, we describe all isometric embeddings of \Gamma_{\delta}(\Pi) in the half-spin Grassmann graphs associated to a polar space of type \textsf{D}_{n'} under the assumption that n\ge 6 is even.
