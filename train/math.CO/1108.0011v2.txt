A cycle C={v_1,v_2,....,v_1} in a tournament T is said to be even, if when walking along C, an even number of edges point in the wrong direction, that is, they are directed from v_{i+1} to v_i. In this short paper, we show that for every fixed even integer k >= 4, if close to half of the k-cycles in a tournament T are even, then T must be quasi-random. This resolves an open question raised in 1991 by Chung and Graham
