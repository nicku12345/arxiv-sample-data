For q=p^r with a prime p\ge 7 such that q \equiv 1 or 19\pmod {30}, the desarguesian projective plane PG(2,q) of order q has a unique conjugacy class of projectivity groups isomorphic to the alternating group A_6 of degree 6. For a projectivity group \Gamma\cong A_6 of PG(2,q), we investigate the geometric properties of the (unique) \Gamma-orbit \mathcal{O} of size 90 such that the 1-point stabilizer of \Gamma in \mathcal O is a cyclic group of order 4. Here \mathcal O lies either in PG(2,q) or in PG(2,q^2) according as 3 is a square or a non-square element in GF(q). We show that if q\geq 349 and q\neq 421, then \mathcal O is a 90-arc, which turns out to be complete for q=349, 409, 529, 601,661. Interestingly, \mathcal O is the smallest known complete arc in PG(2,601) and in PG(2,661). Computations are carried out by MAGMA.
