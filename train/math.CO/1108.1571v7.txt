Let \Gamma_n be the complete undirected Cayley graph of the odd cyclic group Z_n. Connected graphs whose vertices are rainbow tetrahedra in \Gamma_n are studied, with any two such vertices adjacent if and only if they share (as tetrahedra) precisely two distinct triangles. This yields graphs G of largest degree 6, asymptotic diameter |V(G)|^{1/3} and almost all vertices with degree: {\bf(a)} 6 in G; {\bf(b)} 4 in exactly six connected subgraphs of the (3,6,3,6)-semi-regular tessellation; and {\bf(c)} 3 in exactly four connected subgraphs of the \{6,3\}-regular hexagonal tessellation. These vertices have as closed neighborhoods the union (in a fixed way) of closed neighborhoods in the ten respective resulting tessellations. Generalizing asymptotic results are discussed as well.
