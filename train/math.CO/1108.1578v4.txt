In the present paper we prove a certain lemma about the structure of "lower level-sets of convolutions", which are sets of the form \{x \in \Z_N : 1_A*1_A(x) \leq \gamma N\} or of the form \{x \in \Z_N : 1_A*1_A(x) < \gamma N\}, where A is a subset of \Z_N. One result we prove using this lemma is that if |A| = \theta N and |A+A| \leq (1-\eps) N, 0 < \eps < 1, then this level-set contains an arithmetic progression of length at least N^c, c = c(\theta, \eps,\gamma) > 0. It is perhaps possible to obtain such a result using Green's arithmetic regularity lemma (in combination with some ideas of Bourgain); however, our method of proof allows us to obtain non-tower-type quantitative dependence between the constant c and the parameters \theta and \eps. For various reasons (discussed in the paper) one might think, wrongly, that such results would only be possible for level-sets involving triple and higher convolutions.
