A graph G of order 2n is called degree-equipartite if for every n-element set A\subseteq V(G), the degree sequences of the induced subgraphs G[A] and G[V(G)\setminus A] are the same. In this paper, we characterize all degree-equipartite graphs. This answers Problem 1 in the paper by Gr\"{u}nbaum et al [B. Gr\"{u}nbaum, T. Kaiser, D. Kr\'{a}l, and M. Rosenfeld, Equipartite graphs, {\it Israel J. Math.} {\bf 168} (2008), 431-444].
