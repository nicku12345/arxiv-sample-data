By a symbolic method, we introduce multivariate Bernoulli and Euler polynomials as powers of polynomials whose coefficients involve multivariate L\'evy processes. Many properties of these polynomials are stated straightforwardly thanks to this representation, which could be easily implemented in any symbolic manipulation system. A very simple relation between these two families of multivariate polynomials is provided.
