Let \G denote a bipartite distance-regular graph with vertex set X and diameter D \ge 3. Fix x \in X and let L (resp. R) denote the corresponding lowering (resp. raising) matrix. We show that each Q-polynomial structure for \G yields a certain linear dependency among RL^2, LRL, L^2R, L. Define a partial order \le on X as follows. For y,z \in X let y \le z whenever \partial(x,y)+\partial(y,z)=\partial(x,z), where \partial denotes path-length distance. We determine whether the above linear dependency gives this poset a uniform or strongly uniform structure. We show that except for one special case a uniform structure is attained, and except for three special cases a strongly uniform structure is attained.
