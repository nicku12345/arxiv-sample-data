This paper is about: (1) bounds on the number of cliques in a graph in a particular class, and (2) algorithms for listing all cliques in a graph. We present a simple algorithm that lists all cliques in an n-vertex graph in O(n) time per clique. For O(1)-degenerate graphs, such as graphs excluding a fixed minor, we describe a O(n) time algorithm for listing all cliques. We prove that graphs excluding a fixed odd-minor have O(n^2) cliques (which is tight), and conclude a O(n^3) time algorithm for listing all cliques.
