For a given finite group G consisting of morphisms and antimorphisms of a free monoid \mathcal{A}^*, we study infinite words with language closed under the group G. We focus on the notion of G-richness which describes words rich in generalized palindromic factors, i.e., in factors w satisfying \Theta(w) = w for some antimorphism \Theta \in G. We give several equivalent descriptions which are generalizations of know characterizations of rich words (in the terms of classical palindromes) and show two examples of G-rich words.
