Extending the work of Godsil and others, we investigate the notion of the inverse of a graph (specifically, of bipartite graphs with a unique perfect matching). We provide a concise necessary and sufficient condition for the invertibility of such graphs and generalize the notion of invertibility to multigraphs. We examine the question of whether there exists a "litmus subgraph" whose bipartiteness determines invertibility. As an application of our invertibility criteria, we quickly describe all invertible unicyclic graphs. Finally, we describe a general combinatorial procedure for iteratively constructing invertible graphs, giving rise to large new families of such graphs.
