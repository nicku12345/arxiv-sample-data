In this paper we inititate the study of abstract simplicial complexes which are initial segments of qualitative probability orders. This is a natural class that contains the threshold complexes and is contained in the shifted complexes, but is equal to neither. In particular we construct a qualitative probability order on 26 atoms that has an initial segment which is not a threshold simplicial complex. Although 26 is probably not the minimal number for which such example exists we provide some evidence that it cannot be much smaller. We prove some necessary conditions for this class and make a conjecture as to a characterization of them. The conjectured characterization relies on some ideas from cooperative game theory.
