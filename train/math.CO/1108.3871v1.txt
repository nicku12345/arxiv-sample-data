We define the flag space and space of singular vectors for an arrangement A of hyperplanes in projective space equipped with a system of weights a: A --> C. We show that the contravariant bilinear form of the corresponding weighted central arrangement induces a well-defined form on the space of singular vectors of the projectivization. If the sum of the weights a(H), H in A, is zero, then this form is naturally isomorphic to the restriction to the space of singular vectors of the contravariant form of any affine arrangement obtained from A by dehomogenizing with respect to one of its hyperplanes.
