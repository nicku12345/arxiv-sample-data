The (p,q,n)-dipole problem is a map enumeration problem, arising in perturbative Yang-Mills theory, in which the parameters p and q, at each vertex, specify the number of edges separating of two distinguished edges. Combinatorially, it is notable for being a permutation factorization problem which does not lie in the centre of \mathbb{C}[\mathfrak{S}_n], rendering the problem inaccessible through the character theoretic methods often employed to study such problems. This paper gives a solution to this problem on all orientable surfaces when q=n-1, which is a combinatorially significant special case: it is a \emph{near-central} problem. We give an encoding of the (p,n-1,n)-dipole problem as a product of standard basis elements in the centralizer Z_1(n) of the group algebra \mathbb{C}[\mathfrak{S}_n] with respect to the subgroup \mathfrak{S}_{n-1}. The generalized characters arising in the solution to the (p,n-1,n)-dipole problem are zonal spherical functions of the Gel'fand pair (\mathfrak{S}_n\times \mathfrak{S}_{n-1}, \mathrm{diag}(\mathfrak{S}_{n-1})) and are evaluated explicitly. This solution is used to prove that, for a given surface, the numbers of (p,n-1,n)-dipoles and (n+1-p,n-1,n)-dipoles are equal, a fact for which we have no combinatorial explanation. These techniques also give a solution to a near-central analogue of the problem of decomposing a full cycle into two factors of specified cycle type.
