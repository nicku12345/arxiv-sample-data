Let NPO(k) be the smallest number n such that the adjacency matrix of any undirected graph with n vertices or more has at least k nonpositive eigenvalues. We show that NPO(k) is well-defined and prove that the values of NPO(k) for k=1,2,3,4,5 are 1,3,6,10,16 respectively. In addition, we prove that for all k \geq 5, R(k,k+1) \ge NPO(k) > T_k, in which R(k,k+1) is the Ramsey number for k and k+1, and T_k is the k^{th} triangular number. This implies new lower bounds for eigenvalues of Laplacian matrices: the k-th largest eigenvalue is bounded from below by the NPO(k)-th largest degree, which generalizes some prior results.
