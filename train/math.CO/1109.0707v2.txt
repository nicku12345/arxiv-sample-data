For any graph G=(V,E), a subset S\subseteq V \emph{dominates} G if all vertices are contained in the closed neighborhood of S, that is N[S]=V. The minimum cardinality over all such S is called the domination number, written \gamma(G). In 1963, V.G. Vizing conjectured that \gamma(G \square H) \geq \gamma(G)\gamma(H) where \square stands for the Cartesian product of graphs. In this note, we prove the conjecture.
