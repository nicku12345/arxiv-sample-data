The action of the Bernstein operators on Schur functions was given in terms of codes in [CG] and extended to the analog in Schur Q-functions in [HJS]. We define a new combinatorial model of extended codes and show that both of these results follow from a natural combinatorial relation induced on codes. The new algebraic structure provides a natural setting for Schur functions indexed by compositions.
