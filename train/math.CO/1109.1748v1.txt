We have found the most general extension of the celebrated Sauer, Perles and Shelah, Vapnik and Chervonenkis result from 0-1 sequences to k-ary codes still giving a polynomial bound. Let \mathcal{C}\subseteq \{0,1,..., k-1}^n be a k-ary code of length n. For a subset of coordinates S\subset{1,2,...,n} the projection of \mathcal{C} to S is denoted by \mathcal{C}|_S. We say that \mathcal{C} (i,j)-{\em shatters} S if \mathcal{C}|_S contains all the 2^{|S|} distinct vectors (codewords) with coordinates i and j. Suppose that \mathcal{C} does not (i,j)-shatter any coordinate set of size s_{i,j}\geq 1 for every 1\leq i< j\leq q and let p=\sum (s_{i,j}-1). Using a natural induction we prove that  |{\mathcal C}|\leq O(n^p) for any given p as n\to \infty and give a construction showing that this exponent is the best possible. Several open problems are mentioned.
