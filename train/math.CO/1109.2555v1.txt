Buildings of types \textsf{C}_n and \textsf{D}_n are defined by rank n polar spaces. The associated building Grassmannians are polar and half-spin Grassmannians. Apartments in dual polar spaces and half-spin Grassmannians were characterized in \cite{CKS}. We characterize apartments in all polar Grassmannians consisting of non-maximal singular subspaces. This characterization is a partial case of more general results concerning embeddings of polar Johnson graphs in polar Grassmann graphs.
