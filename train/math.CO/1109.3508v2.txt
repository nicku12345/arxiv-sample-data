Let k\geq\ell\geq1 and n\geq 1 be integers. Let G(k,n) be the complete k-partite graph with n vertices in each colour class. An \ell-decomposition of G(k,n) is a set X of copies of K_k in G(k,n) such that each copy of K_\ell in G(k,n) is a subgraph of exactly one copy of K_k in X. This paper asks: when does G(k,n) have an \ell-decomposition? The answer is well known for the \ell=2 case. In particular, G(k,n) has a 2-decomposition if and only if there exists k-2 mutually orthogonal Latin squares of order n. For general \ell, we prove that G(k,n) has an \ell-decomposition if and only if there are k-\ell Latin cubes of dimension \ell and order n, with an additional property that we call mutually invertible. This property is stronger than being mutually orthogonal. An \ell-decomposition of G(k,n) is then constructed whenever no prime less than k divides n.
