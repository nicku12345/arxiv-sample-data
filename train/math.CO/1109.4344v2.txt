Let G be a k-connected graph with k\geq 2. In this paper we first prove that: For two distinct vertices x and z in G, it contains a path passing through its any k-2 {specified} vertices with length at least the average degree of the vertices other than x and z. Further, with this result, we prove that: If G has n vertices and m edges, then it contains a cycle of length at least 2m/(n-1) passing through its any k-1 specified vertices. Our results generalize a theorem of Fan on the existence of long paths and a classical theorem of Erd\"os and Gallai on the existence of long cycles under the average degree condition.
