We study the generalized Galois numbers which count flags of length r in N-dimensional vector spaces over finite fields. We prove that the coefficients of those polynomials are asymptotically Gaussian normally distributed as N becomes large. Furthermore, we interpret the generalized Galois numbers as weighted inversion statistics on the descent classes of the symmetric group on N elements and identify their asymptotic limit as the Mahonian inversion statistic when r approaches infinity. Finally, we apply our statements to derive further statistical aspects of generalized Rogers-Szegoe polynomials, re-interpret the asymptotic behavior of linear q-ary codes and characters of the symmetric group acting on subspaces over finite fields, and discuss implications for affine Demazure modules and joint probability generating functions of descent-inversion statistics.
