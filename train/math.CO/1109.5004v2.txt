For a connected graph G, the \emph{rainbow connection number rc(G)} of a graph G was introduced by Chartrand et al. In "Chakraborty et al., Hardness and algorithms for rainbow connection, J. Combin. Optim. 21(2011), 330--347", Chakraborty et al. proved that for a graph G with diameter 2, to determine rc(G) is NP-Complete, and they left 4 open questions at the end, the last one of which is the following: Suppose that we are given a graph G for which we are told that rc(G)=2. Can we rainbow-color it in polynomial time with o(n) colors ? In this paper, we settle down this question by showing a stronger result that for any graph G with rc(G)=2, we can rainbow-color G in polynomial time by at most 5 colors.
