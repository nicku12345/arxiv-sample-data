One way to study certain classes of polynomials is by considering examples that are attached to combinatorial objects. Any graph G has an associated reciprocal polynomial R_G, and with two particular classes of reciprocal polynomials in mind one can ask the questions: (a) when is R_G a product of cyclotomic polynomials (giving the cyclotomic graphs)? (b) when does R_G have the minimal polynomial of a Salem number as its only non-cyclotomic factor (the non-trival Salem graphs)? Cyclotomic graphs were classified by Smith in 1970. Salem graphs are `spectrally close' to being cyclotomic, in that nearly all their eigenvalues are in the critical interval [-2,2]. On the other hand Salem graphs do not need to be `combinatorially close' to being cyclotomic: the largest cyclotomic induced subgraph might be comparatively tiny.   We define an m-Salem graph to be a connected Salem graph G for which m is minimal such that there exists an induced cyclotomic subgraph of G that has m fewer vertices than G. The 1-Salem subgraphs are both spectrally close and combinatorially close to being cyclotomic. Moreover, every Salem graph contains a 1-Salem graph as an induced subgraph, so these 1-Salem graphs provide some necessary substructure of all Salem graphs. The main result of this paper is a complete combinatorial description of all 1-Salem graphs: there are 26 infinite families and 383 sporadic examples.
