A q-ary t-covering array is an m \times n matrix with entries from \{0, 1, ..., q-1\} with the property that for any t column positions, all q^t possible vectors of length t occur at least once. One wishes to minimize m for given t and n, or maximize n for given t and m. For t = 2 and q = 2, it is completely solved by R\'enyi, Katona, and Kleitman and Spencer. They also show that maximal binary 2-covering arrays are uniquely determined. Roux found the lower bound of m for a general t, n, and q. In this article, we show that m \times n binary 2-covering arrays under some constraints on m and n come from the maximal covering arrays. We also improve the lower bound of Roux for t = 3 and q = 2, and show that some binary 3 or 4-covering arrays are uniquely determined.
