We show that the infinite matroid intersection conjecture of Nash-Williams implies the infinite Menger theorem proved recently by Aharoni and Berger.   We prove that this conjecture is true whenever one matroid is nearly finitary and the second is the dual of a nearly finitary matroid, where the nearly finitary matroids form a superclass of the finitary matroids.   In particular, this proves the infinite matroid intersection conjecture for finite-cycle matroids of 2-connected, locally finite graphs with only a finite number of vertex-disjoint rays.
