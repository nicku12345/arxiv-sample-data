By applying the derivative operator to the corresponding hypergeometric form of a q-series transformation due to Andrews [1,Theorem 4], we establish a general harmonic number identity. As the special cases of it, several interesting Chu-Donno type identities and Paule-Schneider type identities are displayed.
