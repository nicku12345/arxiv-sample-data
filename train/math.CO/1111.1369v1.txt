Levstein and Maldonado [F. Levstein, C. Maldonado, The Terwilliger algebra of the Johnson schemes, Discrete Mathematics 307 (2007) 1621--1635] computed the Terwilliger algebra of the Johnson scheme J(n,m) when 3m\leq n. In this paper, we determine the Terwilliger algebra of the incidence graph J(n,m,m+1) of Johnson geometry when 3m\leq n, give two bases of this algebra, and calculate its dimension.
