Any amicable pair \phi, \psi{} of Sturmian morphisms enables a construction of a ternary morphism \eta{} which preserves the set of infinite words coding 3-interval exchange. We determine the number of amicable pairs with the same incidence matrix in SL^\pm(2,N) and we study incidence matrices associated with the corresponding ternary morphisms \eta.
