Motivated by the theory of cluster algebras, F. Chapoton, S. Fomin and A. Zelevinsky associated to each finite type root system a simple convex polytope called \emph{generalized associahedron}. They provided an explicit realization of this polytope associated with a bipartite orientation of the corresponding Dynkin diagram.   In the first part of this paper, using the parametrization of cluster variables by their g-vectors explicitly computed by S.-W. Yang and A. Zelevinsky, we generalize the original construction to any orientation. In the second part we show that our construction agrees with the one given by C. Hohlweg, C. Lange, and H. Thomas in the setup of Cambrian fans developed by N. Reading and D. Speyer.
