Let G=(V,E) be a random electronic network with the boundary vertices which is obtained by assigning a resistance of each edge in a random graph in \mathbb{G}(n,p) and the voltages on the boundary vertices. In this paper, we prove that the potential distribution of all vertices of G except for the boundary vertices are very close to a constant with high probability for p=\frac{c\ln n}{n} and c>1.
