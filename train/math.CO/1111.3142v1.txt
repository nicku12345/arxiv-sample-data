We give an asymptotic estimate of the number of numerical semigroups of a given genus. In particular, if n_g is the number of numerical semigroups of genus g, we prove that n_g tends to S \phi^g, where \phi is the golden ratio, and S is a constant, resolving several related conjectures concerning the growth of n_g. In addition, we show that the proportion of numerical semigroups of genus g satisfying f < 3m approaches 1 as g \rightarrow \infty, where m is the multiplicity and f is the Frobenius number.
