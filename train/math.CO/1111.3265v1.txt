Let k,l,m,n, and \mu be positive integers. A \mathbb{Z}_\mu--{\it scheme of valency} (k,l) and {\it order} (m,n) is a m \times n array (S_{ij}) of subsets S_{ij} \subseteq \mathbb{Z}_\mu such that for each row and column one has \sum_{j=1}^n |S_{ij}| = k  and \sum_{i=1}^m |S_{ij}| = l, respectively. Any such scheme is an algebraic equivalent of a (k,l)-semi-regular bipartite voltage graph with n and m vertices in the bipartition sets and voltages coming from the cyclic group \mathbb{Z}_\mu. We are interested in the subclass of \mathbb{Z}_\mu--schemes that are characterized by the property a - b + c - d\; \not \equiv \;0 (mod \mu) for all a \in S_{ij}, b \in S_{ih}, c \in S_{gh}, and d \in S_{gj} where i,g \in {1,...,m} and j,h \in {1,...,n} need not be distinct. These \mathbb{Z}_\mu--schemes can be used to represent adjacency matrices of regular graphs of girth \ge 5 and semi-regular bipartite graphs of girth \ge 6. For suitable \rho, \sigma \in \mathbb{N} with \rho k = \sigma l, they also represent incidence matrices for polycyclic (\rho \mu_k, \sigma \mu_l) configurations and, in particular, for all known Desarguesian elliptic semiplanes. Partial projective closures yield {\it mixed \mathbb{Z}_\mu-schemes}, which allow new constructions for Kr\v{c}adinac's sporadic configuration of type (34_6) and Balbuena's bipartite (q-1)-regular graphs of girth 6 on as few as 2(q^2-q-2) vertices, with q ranging over prime powers. Besides some new results, this survey essentially furnishes new proofs in terms of (mixed) \mathbb{Z}_\mu--schemes for ad-hoc constructions used thus far.
