Let q be a prime power; (q+1,8)-cages have been constructed as incidence graphs of a non-degenerate quadric surface in projective 4-space P(4, q). The first contribution of this paper is a construction of these graphs in an alternative way by means of an explicit formula using graphical terminology. Furthermore by removing some specific perfect dominating sets from a (q+1,8)-cage we derive k-regular graphs of girth 8 for k= q-1 and k=q, having the smallest number of vertices known so far.
