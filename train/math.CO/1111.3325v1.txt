The problem of packing Hamilton cycles in random and pseudorandom graphs has been studied extensively. In this paper, we look at the dual question of covering all edges of a graph by Hamilton cycles and prove that if a graph with maximum degree \Delta satisfies some basic expansion properties and contains a family of (1-o(1))\Delta/2 edge disjoint Hamilton cycles, then there also exists a covering of its edges by (1+o(1))\Delta/2 Hamilton cycles. This implies that for every \alpha >0 and every p \geq n^{\alpha-1} there exists a covering of all edges of G(n,p) by (1+o(1))np/2 Hamilton cycles asymptotically almost surely, which is nearly optimal.
