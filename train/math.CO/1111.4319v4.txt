Lower and upper bounds on the size of a covering of subspaces in the Grassmann graph \cG_q(n,r) by subspaces from the Grassmann graph \cG_q(n,k), k \geq r, are discussed. The problem is of interest from four points of view: coding theory, combinatorial designs, q-analogs, and projective geometry. In particular we examine coverings based on lifted maximum rank distance codes, combined with spreads and a recursive construction. New constructions are given for q=2 with r=2 or r=3. We discuss the density for some of these coverings. Tables for the best known coverings, for q=2 and 5 \leq n \leq 10, are presented. We present some questions concerning possible constructions of new coverings of smaller size.
