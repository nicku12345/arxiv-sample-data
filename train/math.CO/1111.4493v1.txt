Let k and m be positive integers. A collection of k-multisets from \{1,..., m \} is intersecting if every pair of multisets from the collection is intersecting. We prove that for m \geq k+1, the size of the largest such collection is \binom{m+k-2}{k-1} and that when m > k+1, only a collection of all the k-multisets containing a fixed element will attain this bound. The size and structure of the largest intersecting collection of k-multisets for m \leq k is also given.
