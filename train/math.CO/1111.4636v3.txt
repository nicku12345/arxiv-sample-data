A family of sets \mathcal{F} \subseteq 2^{[n]} is defined to be l-trace k-Sperner if for any l-subset L of [n] the family of traces \mathcal{F}|_L=\{F \cap L: F \in \mathcal{F}\} does not contain any chain of length k+1. In this paper we prove that for any positive integers l',k with l'<k if \mathcal{F} is (n-l')-trace k-Sperner, then |\mathcal{F}| \le (k-l'+o(1))\binom{n}{\lfloor n/2\rfloor} and this bound is asymptotically tight.
