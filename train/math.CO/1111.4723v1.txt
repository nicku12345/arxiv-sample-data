Recently, Jel\'{i}nek derived that the number of self-dual interval orders of reduced size n is twice the number of row-Fishburn matrices of size n by using generating functions. In this paper, we present a bijective proof of this relation by establishing a bijection between two variations of upper-triangular matrices of nonnegative integers. Using the bijection, we provide a combinatorial proof of the refined relations between self-dual Fishburn matrices and row-Fishburn matrices in answer to a problem proposed by Jel\'{i}nek.
