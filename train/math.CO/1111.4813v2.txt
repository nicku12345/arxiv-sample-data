We use Razborov's flag algebra method to show an asymptotic upper bound for the maximal induced density i(\vec P_3) of the orgraph \vec P_3 in an arbitrary orgraph. A conjecture of Thomass\'e states that i(\vec P_3)=2/5. The hitherto best known upper bound i(\vec P_3)\leq12/25 was given by Bondy. We can show that i(\vec P_3)\leq 0.4446. Further, we consider such a maximal density for some other small orgraphs. With easy arguments one can see that i(\vec C_3)=1/4, i(\vec K_2 \cup \vec E_1)=3/4 and 2/21\leq i(\vec C_4). We show that i(\vec C_4)\leq 0.1104 and conjecture that the extremal orgraphs of \vec P_3 and \vec C_4 are the same. Furthermore we show that 6-4\sqrt{2}\leq i(\vec K_{1,2})\leq 0.4644.
