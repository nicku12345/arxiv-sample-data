A finite group G is called a Schur group, if any Schur ring over G is the transitivity module of a permutation group on the set G containing the regular subgroup of all right translations. It was proved by R. P\"oschel (1974) that given a prime p\ge 5 a p-group is Schur if and only if it is cyclic. We prove that a cyclic group of order n is a Schur group if and only if n belongs to one of the following five (partially overlapped) families of integers: p^k, pq^k, 2pq^k, pqr, 2pqr where p,q,r are distinct primes, and k\ge 0 is an integer.
