Let G be a simple n-vertex graph with degree sequence d_1,d_2,...,d_n and vertex set \V(G). The degree of v\in\V(G) is denoted by \D(v). The smallest integer r for which \V(G) has an r-partition  \V(G)=V_1\cup V_2\cup...\cup V_r,\quad V_i\cap V_j=\emptyset, \quad,i\neq j  such that \D(v)\leq n-\abs{V_i}, \forall v\in V_i, i=1,2,...,r is denoted by \f(G). In this note we prove the inequality  \f(G)\geq\frac n{n-\bar{\bar{d}}},  where \bar{\bar{d}}=\sqrt{\dfrac{d_1^2+d_2^2+...+d_n^2}n}.
