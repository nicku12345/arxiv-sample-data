The bondage number b(G) of a graph G is the smallest number of edges whose removal from G results in a graph with larger domination number. Recently Gagarin and Zverovich showed that, for a graph G with maximum degree \Delta(G) and embeddable on an orientable surface of genus h and a non-orientable surface of genus k, b(G)\leq\min\{\Delta(G)+h+2,\Delta+k+1\}. They also gave examples showing that adjustments of their proofs implicitly provide better results for larger values of h and k. In this paper we establish an improved explicit upper bound for b(G), using the Euler characteristic \chi instead of the genera h and k, with the relations \chi=2-2h and \chi=2-k. We show that b(G)\leq\Delta(G)+\lfloor r\rfloor for the case \chi\leq0 (i.e. h\geq1 or k\geq2), where r is the largest real root of the cubic equation z^3+2z^2+(6\chi-7)z+18\chi-24=0. Our proof is based on the technique developed by Carlson-Develin and Gagarin-Zverovich, and includes some elementary calculus as a new ingredient. We also find an asymptotically equivalent result b(G)\leq\Delta(G)+\lceil\sqrt{12-6\chi\,}-1/2\rceil for \chi\leq0, and a further improvement for graphs with large girth.
