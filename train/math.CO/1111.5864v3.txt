The \emph{metric dimension} of a graph G, denoted by \dim(G), is the minimum number of vertices such that each vertex is uniquely determined by its distances to the chosen vertices. Let G_1 and G_2 be disjoint copies of a graph G and let f: V(G_1) \rightarrow V(G_2) be a function. Then a \emph{functigraph} C(G, f)=(V, E) has the vertex set V=V(G_1) \cup V(G_2) and the edge set E=E(G_1) \cup E(G_2) \cup \{uv \mid v=f(u)\}. We study how metric dimension behaves in passing from G to C(G,f) by first showing that 2 \le \dim(C(G, f)) \le 2n-3, if G is a connected graph of order n \ge 3 and f is any function. We further investigate the metric dimension of functigraphs on complete graphs and on cycles.
