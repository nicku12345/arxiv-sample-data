We explicitly describe the possible pairs of triangle and square densities for r-regular finite simple graphs. We also prove that every r-regular unimodular random graph can be approximated by r-regular finite graphs with respect to these densities. As a corollary one gets an explicit description of the possible pairs of the third and fourth moments of the spectral measure of r-regular unimodular random graphs.
