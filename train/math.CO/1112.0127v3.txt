The generalized k-connectivity \kappa_k(G) of a graph G was introduced by Chartrand et al. in 1984. It is natural to introduce the concept of generalized k-edge-connectivity \lambda_k(G). For general k, the generalized k-edge-connectivity of a complete graph is obtained. For k\geq 3, tight upper and lower bounds of \kappa_k(G) and \lambda_k(G) are given for a connected graph G of order n, that is, 1\leq \kappa_k(G)\leq n-\lceil\frac{k}{2}\rceil and 1\leq \lambda_k(G)\leq n-\lceil\frac{k}{2}\rceil. Graphs of order n such that \kappa_k(G)=n-\lceil\frac{k}{2}\rceil and \lambda_k(G)=n-\lceil\frac{k}{2}\rceil are characterized, respectively. Nordhaus-Gaddum-type results for the generalized k-connectivity are also obtained. For k=3, we study the relation between the edge-connectivity and the generalized 3-edge-connectivity of a graph. Upper and lower bounds of \lambda_3(G) for a graph G in terms of the edge-connectivity \lambda of G are obtained, that is, \frac{3\lambda-2}{4}\leq \lambda_3(G)\leq \lambda, and two graph classes are given showing that the upper and lower bounds are tight. From these bounds, we obtain that \lambda(G)-1\leq \lambda_3(G)\leq \lambda(G) if G is a connected planar graph, and the relation between the generalized 3-connectivity and generalized 3-edge-connectivity of a graph and its line graph.
