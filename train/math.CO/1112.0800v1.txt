A class of graphs that lies strictly between the classes of graphs of genus (at most) k-1 and k is studied. For a fixed orientable surface S_k of genus k, let A_{xy}^k be the minor-closed class of graphs with terminals x and y that either embed into S_{k-1} or admit an embedding \Pi into S_k such that there is a \Pi-face where x and y appear twice in the alternating order. In this paper, the obstructions for the classes A_{xy}^k are studied. In particular, the complete list of obstructions for A_{xy}^1 is presented.
