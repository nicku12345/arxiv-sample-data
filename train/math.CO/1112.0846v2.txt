Let G=(V,E) be a simple graph. A set S\subseteq V(G) is called an outer-connected dominating set (or ocd-set) of G, if S is a dominating set of G and either S=V(G) or V\backslash S is a connected graph. In this paper we introduce a polynomial which its coefficients are the number of ocd-sets of G. We obtain some properties of this polynomial and its coefficients. Also we compute this polynomial for some specific graphs.
