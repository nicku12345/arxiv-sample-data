We consider a \emph{code} to be a subset of the vertex set of a \emph{Hamming graph}. In this setting a \emph{neighbour} of the code is a vertex which differs in exactly one entry from some codeword. This paper examines codes with the property that some group of automorphisms acts transitively on the \emph{set of neighbours} of the code. We call these codes \emph{neighbour transitive}. We obtain sufficient conditions for a neighbour transitive group to fix the code setwise. Moreover, we construct an infinite family of neighbour transitive codes, with \emph{minimum distance} \delta=4, where this is not the case. That is to say, knowledge of even the complete set of code neighbours does not determine the code.
