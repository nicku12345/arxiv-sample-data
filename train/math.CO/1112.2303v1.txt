In this work, we give combinatorial proofs for generating functions of two problems, i.e., flushed partitions and concave compositions of even length. We also give combinatorial interpretation of one problem posed by Sylvester involving flushed partitions and then prove it. For these purposes, we first describe an involution and use it to prove core identities. Using this involution with modifications, we prove several problems of different nature, including Andrews' partition identities involving initial repetitions and partition theoretical interpretations of three mock theta functions of third order f(q), \phi(q) and \psi(q). An identity of Ramanujan is proved combinatorially. Several new identities are also established.
