The spectral radius \rho(G) of a graph G is the largest eigenvalue of its adjacency matrix. Woo and Neumaier discovered that a connected graph G with \rho(G)\leq 3/2{\sqrt{2}} is either a dagger, an open quipu, or a closed quipu. The reverse statement is not true. Many open quipus and closed quipus have spectral radius greater than 3/2{\sqrt{2}}. In this paper we proved the following results. For any open quipu G on n vertices (n\geq 6) with spectral radius less than 3/2{\sqrt{2}}, its diameter D(G) satisfies D(G)\geq (2n-4)/3. This bound is tight. For any closed quipu G on n vertices (n\geq 13) with spectral radius less than 3/2{\sqrt{2}}, its diameter D(G) satisfies \frac{n}{3}< D(G)\leq \frac{2n-2}{3}. The upper bound is tight while the lower bound is asymptotically tight.   Let G^{min}_{n,D} be a graph with minimal spectral radius among all connected graphs on n vertices with diameter D. We applied the results and found G^{min}_{n,D} for some range of D. For n\geq 13 and D\in [\frac{n}{2}, \frac{2n-7}{3}], we proved that G^{min}_{n,D} is the graph obtained by attaching two paths of length D-\lfloor\frac{n}{2}\rfloor and D-\lceil\frac{n}{2}\rceil to a pair of antipodal vertices of the even cycle C_{2(n-D)}. Thus we settled a conjecture of Cioab-van Dam-Koolen-Lee, who previously proved a special case D=\frac{n+e}{2} for e=1,2,3,4.
