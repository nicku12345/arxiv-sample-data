We formalize the general principle of significance with respect to binary relations which is a universal tool for description and analysis of various situations in and apart from mathematics. We derive the basic properties and focus on a special family of relations induced by linear orders. We show several ways of mathematical applications, propose methods for calculating the required set and sketch possible use in other sciences.
