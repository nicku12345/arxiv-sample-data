Let V be an n-dimensional left vector space over a division ring R. We write {\mathcal G}_{k}(V) for the Grassmannian formed by k-dimensional subspaces of V and denote by \Gamma_{k}(V) the associated Grassmann graph. Let also V' be an n'-dimensional left vector space over a division ring R'. Isometric embeddings of \Gamma_{k}(V) in \Gamma_{k'}(V') are classified in \cite{Pankov2}. A classification of J(n,k)-subsets in {\mathcal G}_{k'}(V'), i.e. the images of isometric embeddings of the Johnson graph J(n,k) in \Gamma_{k'}(V'), is presented in \cite{Pankov1}. We characterize isometric embeddings of \Gamma_{k}(V) in \Gamma_{k'}(V') as mappings which transfer apartments of {\mathcal G}_{k}(V) to J(n,k)-subsets of {\mathcal G}_{k'}(V'). This is a generalization of the earlier result concerning apartments preserving mappings \cite[Theorem 3.10]{Pankov-book}.
