We describe the structure of triconnected graph with the help of its decomposition by 3-cutsets. We divide all 3-cutsets of a triconnected graph into rather small groups with a simple structure, named complexes. The detailed description of all complexes is presented. Moreover, we prove that the structure of a hypertree could be introduced on the set of all complexes. This structure gives us a complete description of the relative disposition of the complexes.   Keywords: connectivity, triconneted graphs.
