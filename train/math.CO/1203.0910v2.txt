Vertigan has shown that if M is a binary matroid, then |T_M(-\iota,\iota)|, the modulus of the Tutte polynomial of M as evaluated in (-\iota, \iota), can be expressed in terms of the bicycle dimension of M. In this paper, we describe how the argument of the complex number T_M(-\iota,\iota) depends on a certain \zfour-valued quadratic form that is canonically associated with M. We show how to evaluate T_M(-\iota,\iota) in polynomial time, as well as the canonical tripartition of M and further related invariants.
