Let (X,S) be a p-scheme of order p^3 and T the thin residue of S. Now we assume that T has valency p^2. It is easy to see that one of the following holds: (i) |T|=p^2 and T\simeq C_{p^2}; (ii) |T|=p^2 and T\simeq C_p\times C_p; (iii) |T|<p^2.   It is known that (X,S) is Schurian if (i) holds. If (ii) holds, we will show that (X,S) induces a partial linear space on X/T. Moreover, the character degrees of (X,S) coincide with the sizes of the lines of the partial linear space. Under the assumption (iii) we will show a construction of non-Schurian p-schemes which are algebraically isomorphic to a Schurian p-scheme of order p^3.
