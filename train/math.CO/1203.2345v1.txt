We propose some new method of constructing configurations, which consists in consecutive inscribing copies of one underlying configuration. A uniform characterization of the obtained class and the one introduced in our paper untitled "Multiplied configurations, series induced by correlations", which makes use of some covering by family of closed substructures, is given.
