If S is a cofinite set of positive integers, an "S-restricted composition of n" is a sequence of elements of S, denoted \vec{\lambda}=(\lambda_1,\lambda_2,...), whose sum is n. For uniform random S-restricted compositions, the random variable {\bf B}(\vec{\lambda})=\prod_i \lambda_i is asymptotically lognormal. The proof is based upon a combinatorial technique for decomposing a composition into a sequence of smaller compositions.
