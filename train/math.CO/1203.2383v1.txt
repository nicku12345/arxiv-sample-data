Let G be a finite abelian group with exponent n, and let r be a positive integer. Let A be a k\times m matrix with integer entries. We show that if A satisfies some natural conditions and |G| is large enough then, for each r--coloring of G\setminus \{0\}, there is \delta depending only on r,n and m such that the homogeneous linear system Ax=0 has at least \delta |G|^{m-k} monochromatic solutions. Density versions of this counting result are also addressed.
