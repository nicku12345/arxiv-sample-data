We consider the problem of sums of dilates in groups of prime order. We show that given A\subset \Z{p} of sufficiently small density then \big| \lambda_{1}A+\lambda_{2}A+...+ \lambda_{k}A \big| \,\ge\,\bigg(\sum_{i}|\lambda_{i}|\bigg)|A|- o(|A|), whereas on the other hand, for any \epsilon>0, we construct subsets of density 1/2-\epsilon such that |A+\lambda A|\leq (1-\delta)p, showing that there is a very different behaviour for subsets of large density.
