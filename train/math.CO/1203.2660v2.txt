A set of vertices S in a graph G is a {\em resolving set} for G if, for any two vertices u,v, there exists x\in S such that the distances d(u,x) \neq d(v,x). In this paper, we consider the Johnson graphs J(n,k) and Kneser graphs K(n,k), and obtain various constructions of resolving sets for these graphs. As well as general constructions, we show that various interesting combinatorial objects can be used to obtain resolving sets in these graphs, including (for Johnson graphs) projective planes and symmetric designs, as well as (for Kneser graphs) partial geometries, Hadamard matrices, Steiner systems and toroidal grids.
