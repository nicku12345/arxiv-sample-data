Let G be a k-partite graph with n vertices in parts such that each vertex is adjacent to at least \delta^*(G) vertices in each of the other parts. Magyar and Martin \cite{MaMa} proved that for k=3, if \delta^*(G)\ge 2/3n  and n is sufficiently large, then G contains a K_3-factor (a spanning subgraph consisting of n vertex-disjoint copies of K_3) except that G is one particular graph. Martin and Szemer\'edi \cite{MaSz} proved that G contains a K_4-factor when \delta^*(G)\ge 3/4n and n is sufficiently large. Both results were proved by the Regularity Lemma. In this paper we give a proof of these two results by the absorbing method. Our absorbing lemma actually works for all k\ge 3.
