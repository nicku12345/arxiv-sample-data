In this paper we analyze classical Maker-Breaker games played on the edge set of a sparse random board G\sim \gnp. We consider the Hamiltonicity game, the perfect matching game and the k-connectivity game. We prove that for p(n)\geq \text{polylog}(n)/n, the board G\sim \gnp is typically such that Maker can win these games asymptotically as fast as possible, i.e. within n+o(n), n/2+o(n) and kn/2+o(n) moves respectively.
