For a positive integer k we consider the k-vertex-connectivity game, played on the edge set of K_n, the complete graph on n vertices. We first study the Maker-Breaker version of this game and prove that, for any integer k \geq 2 and sufficiently large n, Maker has a strategy for winning this game within \lfloor k n/2 \rfloor + 1 moves, which is clearly best possible. This answers a question of Hefetz, Krivelevich, Stojakovi\'c and Szab\'o. We then consider the strong k-vertex-connectivity game. For every positive integer k and sufficiently large n, we describe an explicit first player's winning strategy for this game.
