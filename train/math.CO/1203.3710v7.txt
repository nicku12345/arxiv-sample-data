This is a note on three graph parameters motivated by the Euler-Poincare characteristic for simplicial complex. We show those three graph parameters of a given connected graph G is greater than or equal to that of the complete graph with \max(h(G),\chi(G)) vertices. This will yield three different simultaneous upperbounds of both the hadwiger number and chromatic number by means of the number of particular types of induced subgraphs. Some applications to Hadwiger's Conjecture is also discussed.
