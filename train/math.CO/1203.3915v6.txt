Bedrossian characterized all pairs of forbidden subgraphs for a 2-connected graph to be Hamiltonian. Instead of forbidding some induced subgraphs, we relax the conditions for graphs to be Hamiltonian by restricting Ore- and Fan-type degree conditions on these induced subgraphs. Let G be a graph on n vertices and H be an induced subgraph of G. H is called \emph{o}-heavy if there are two nonadjacent vertices in H with degree sum at least n, and is called f-heavy if for every two vertices u,v\in V(H), d_{H}(u,v)=2 implies that \max\{d(u),d(v)\}\geq n/2. We say that G is H-\emph{o}-heavy (H-\emph{f}-heavy) if every induced subgraph of G isomorphic to H is \emph{o}-heavy (\emph{f}-heavy). In this paper we characterize all connected graphs R and S other than P_3 such that every 2-connected R-\emph{f}-heavy and S-\emph{f}-heavy (R-\emph{o}-heavy and S-\emph{f}-heavy, R-\emph{f}-heavy and S-free) graph is Hamiltonian. Our results extend several previous theorems on forbidden subgraph conditions and heavy subgraph conditions for Hamiltonicity of 2-connected graphs.
