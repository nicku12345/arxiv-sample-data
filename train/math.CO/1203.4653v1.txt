In this paper, we give bijections between the set of 4123-avoiding down-up alternating permutations of length 2n and the set of standard Young tableaux of shape (n,n,n), and between the set of 4123-avoiding down-up alternating permutations of length 2n-1 and the set of shifted standard Young tableaux of shape (n+1, n, n-1) via an intermediate structure of Yamanouchi words. Moreover, we get the enumeration of 4123-avoiding up-down alternating permutations of even and odd length by presenting bijections between 4123-avoiding up-down alternating permutations and standard Young tableaux.
