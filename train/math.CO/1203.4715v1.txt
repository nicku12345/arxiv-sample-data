For any flag nestohedron, we define a flag simplicial complex whose f-vector is the \gamma-vector of the nestohedron. This proves that the \gamma-vector of any flag nestohedron satisfies the Frankl-F\"{u}redi-Kalai inequalities, partially solving a conjecture by Nevo and Petersen \cite{np}. We also compare these complexes to those defined by Nevo and Petersen in \cite{np} for particular flag nestohedra.
