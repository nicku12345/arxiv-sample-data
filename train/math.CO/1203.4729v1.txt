We use Young's raising operators to derive a Pieri rule for the ring generated by the indeterminates h_{r,s} given in Macdonald's 9th Variation of the Schur functions. Under an appropriate specialisation of h_{r,s}, we derive the Pieri rule for the ring \La(a) of double symmetric functions, which has a basis consisting of the double Schur functions. Together with a suitable interpretation of the Jacobi--Trudi identity, our Pieri rule allows us to obtain a new proof of a rule to calculate the Littlewood--Richardson polynomials, which gives a multiplication rule for the double Schur functions.
