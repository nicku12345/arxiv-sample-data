Let 1 \le m \le n. We prove various results about the chessboard complex M_{m,n}, which is the simplicial complex of matchings in the complete bipartite graph K_{m,n}. First, we demonstrate that there is nonvanishing 3-torsion in H_d(M_{m,n};Z) whenever \frac{m+n-4}{3} \le d \le m-4 and whenever 6 \le m < n and d=m-3. Combining this result with theorems due to Friedman and Hanlon and to Shareshian and Wachs, we characterize all triples (m,n,d) satisfying H_{d}(M_{m,n};Z) \neq 0. Second, for each k \ge 0, we show that there is a polynomial f_k(a,b) of degree 3k such that the dimension of H_{k+a+2b-2}(M_{k+a+3b-1,k+2a+3b-1};Z_3), viewed as a vector space over Z_3, is at most f_k(a,b) for all a \ge 0 and b \ge k+2. Third, we give a computer-free proof that H_2(M_{5,5};Z) \cong Z_3. Several proofs are based on a new long exact sequence relating the homology of a certain subcomplex of M_{m,n} to the homology of M_{m-2,n-1} and M_{m-2,n-3}.
