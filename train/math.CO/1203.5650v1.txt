J. L. Andersen proved that there is 5-torsion in the bottom nonvanishing homology group of the simplicial complex of graphs of degree at most two on seven vertices. We use this result to demonstrate that there is 5-torsion also in the bottom nonvanishing homology group of the matching complex M_{14} on 14 vertices. Combining our observation with results due to Bouc and to Shareshian and Wachs, we conclude that the case n=14 is exceptional; for all other n, the torsion subgroup of the bottom nonvanishing homology group has exponent three or is zero. The possibility remains that there is other torsion than 3-torsion in higher-degree homology groups of M_n when n \ge 13 and n \neq 14.
