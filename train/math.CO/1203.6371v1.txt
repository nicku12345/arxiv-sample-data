We consider the problem of rank aggregation based on new distance measures derived through axiomatic approaches and based on score-based methods. In the first scenario, we derive novel distance measures that allow for discriminating between the ranking process of highest and lowest ranked elements in the list. These distance functions represent weighted versions of Kendall's tau measure and may be computed efficiently in polynomial time. Furthermore, we describe how such axiomatic approaches may be extended to the study of score-based aggregation and present the first analysis of distributed vote aggregation over networks.
