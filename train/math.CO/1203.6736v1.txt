The classical Eulerian polynomials can be expanded in the basis t^{k-1}(1+t)^{n+1-2k} (1\leq k\leq\lfloor (n+1)/2\rfloor) with positive integral coefficients. This formula implies both the symmetry and the unimodality of the Eulerian polynomials. In this paper, we prove a q-analogue of this expansion for Carlitz's q-Eulerian polynomials as well as a similar formula for Chow-Gessel's q-Eulerian polynomials of type B. We shall give some applications of these two formulae, which involve two new sequences of polynomials in the variable q with positive integral coefficients. An open problem is to give a combinatorial interpretation for these polynomials.
