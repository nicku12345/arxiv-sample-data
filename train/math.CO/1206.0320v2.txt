In the set of all patterns in S_n, it is clear that each k-pattern occurs equally often. If we instead restrict to the class of permutations avoiding a specific pattern, the situation quickly becomes more interesting. Mikl\'os B\'ona recently proved that, surprisingly, if we consider the class of permutations avoiding the pattern 132, all other non-monotone patterns of length 3 are equally common. In this paper we examine the class \Av (123), and give exact formula for the occurrences of each length 3 pattern. While this class does not break down as nicely as \Av (132), we find some interesting similarities between the two and prove that the number of 231 patterns is the same in each.
