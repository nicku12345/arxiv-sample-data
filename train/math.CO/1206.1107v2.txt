For positive integers m and n, define f(m,n) to be the smallest integer such that any subset A of the m \times n integer grid with |A| \geq f(m,n) contains a rectangle; that is, there are x\in [m] and y \in [n] and d_{1},d_{2} \in \mathbb{Z}^{+} such that all four points (x,y), (x+d_{1},y), (x,y+d_{2}), and (x+d_{1},y+d_{2}) are contained in A. In \cite{kovarisosturan}, K\"ovari, S\'os, and Tur\'an showed that \dlim_{k \to \infty}\dfrac{f(k,k)}{k^{3/2}} = 1. They also showed that whenever p is a prime number, f(p^{2},p^{2}+p) = p^{2}(p+1)+1. We recover their asymptotic result and strengthen the second, providing cleaner proofs which exploit a connection to projective planes, first noticed by Mendelsohn in \cite{mendelsohn87}. We also provide an explicit lower bound for f(k,k) which holds for all k.
