We prove that the Mahonian-Stirling pairs of permutation statistics (\sor, \cyc) and (\inv, \mathrm{rlmin}) are equidistributed on the set of permutations that correspond to arrangements of n non-atacking rooks on a Ferrers board with n rows and n columns. The proofs are combinatorial and use bijections between matchings and Dyck paths and a new statistic, sorting index for matchings, that we define. We also prove a refinement of this equidistribution result which describes the minimal elements in the permutation cycles and the right-to-left minimum letters. Moreover, we define a sorting index for bicolored matchings and use it to show analogous equidistribution results for restricted permutations of type B_n and D_n.
