We prove that the quivers with potentials associated to triangulations of surfaces with marked points, and possibly empty boundary, are non-degenerate, provided the underlying surface with marked points is not a closed sphere with exactly 5 punctures. This is done by explicitly defining the QPs that correspond to tagged triangulations and proving that whenever two tagged triangulations are related by a flip, their associated QPs are related by the corresponding QP-mutation. As a byproduct, for (arbitrarily punctured) surfaces with non-empty boundary we obtain a proof of the non-degeneracy of the associated QPs which is independent from the one given by the author in the first paper of the series.   The main tool used to prove the aforementioned compatibility between flips and QP-mutations is what we have called \emph{Popping Theorem}, which, roughly speaking, says that an apparent lack of symmetry in the potentials arising from ideal triangulations with self-folded triangles can be fixed by a suitable right-equivalence.
