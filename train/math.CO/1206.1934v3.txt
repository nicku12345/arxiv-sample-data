In the present paper, we have found new upper bounds for chromatic numbers for integer lattices and some rational spaces and other lattices. In particular, we have proved that for any concrete critical distance d the chromatic number of \Z^{n} with critical distance \sqrt{2d} has a polynomial growth in n with exponent less than or equal to d (sometimes this estimate is sharp). The same statement is true not only in the Euclidean norm, but also in any l_{p} norm. Besides, we have given concrete estimates for some small dimensions as well as upper bounds for the chromatic number of \Q_{p}^{n}, where by \Q_{p} we mean the ring of all rational numbers having denominators not divisible by some prime numbers.
