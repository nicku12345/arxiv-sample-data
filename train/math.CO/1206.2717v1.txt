Many problems in combinatorial geometry can be formulated in terms of curves or surfaces containing many points of a cartesian product. In 2000, Elekes and R\'onyai proved that if the graph of a polynomial contains cn^2 points of an n\times n\times n cartesian product in \mathbb{R}^3, then the polynomial has the form f(x,y)=g(k(x)+l(y)) or f(x,y)=g(k(x)l(y)). They used this to prove a conjecture of Purdy which states that given two lines in \mathbb{R}^2 and n points on each line, if the number of distinct distances between pairs of points, one on each line, is at most cn, then the lines are parallel or orthogonal. We extend the Elekes-R\'onyai Theorem to a less symmetric cartesian product. We also extend the Elekes-R\'onyai Theorem to one dimension higher on an n\times n\times n\times n cartesian product and an asymmetric cartesian product. We give a proof of a variation of Purdy's conjecture with fewer points on one of the lines. We finish with a lower bound for our main result in one dimension higher with asymmetric cartesian product, showing that it is near-optimal.
