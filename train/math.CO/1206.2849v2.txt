Ascent sequences were introduced by Bousquet-M\'{e}lou, Claesson, Dukes and Kitaev in their study of (\bf{2+2})-free posets. An ascent sequence of length n is a nonnegative integer sequence x=x_{1}x_{2}... x_{n} such that x_{1}=0 and x_{i}\leq \asc(x_{1}x_{2}...x_{i-1})+1 for all 1<i\leq n, where \asc(x_{1}x_{2}...x_{i-1}) is the number of ascents in the sequence x_{1}x_{2}... x_{i-1}. We let \cA_n stand for the set of such sequences and use \cA_n(p) for the subset of sequences avoiding a pattern p. Similarly, we let S_{n}(\tau) be the set of \tau-avoiding permutations in the symmetric group S_{n}. Duncan and Steingr\'{\i}msson have shown that the ascent statistic has the same distribution over \cA_n(021) as over S_n(132). Furthermore, they conjectured that the pair (\asc, \rlm) is equidistributed over \cA_n(021) and S_n(132) where \rlm is the right-to-left minima statistic. We prove this conjecture by constructing a bistatistic-preserving bijection.
