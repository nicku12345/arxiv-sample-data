We use an entropy based method to study two graph maximization problems. We upper bound the number of matchings of fixed size \ell in a d-regular graph on N vertices. For \frac{2\ell}{N} bounded away from 0 and 1, the logarithm of the bound we obtain agrees in its leading term with the logarithm of the number of matchings of size \ell in the graph consisting of \frac{N}{2d} disjoint copies of the complete bipartite graph K_{d,d}. This provides asymptotic evidence for a conjecture of S. Friedland {\it et al.}.   We also obtain an analogous result for independent sets of a fixed size in regular graphs, giving asymptotic evidence for a conjecture of J. Kahn. Our bounds on the number of matchings and independent sets of a fixed size are derived from bounds on the partition function (or generating polynomial) for matchings and independent sets.
