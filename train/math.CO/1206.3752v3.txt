Let n\geqslant 3 be a natural number. We study the problem to find the smallest r such that there is a family \mathcal{A} of 2-subsets and 3-subsets of [n]=\{1,2,...,n\} with the following properties: (1) \mathcal{A} is an antichain, i.e. no member of \mathcal A is a subset of any other member of \mathcal A, (2) \mathcal A is maximal, i.e. for every X\in 2^{[n]}\setminus\mathcal A there is an A\in\mathcal A with X\subseteq A or A\subseteq X, and (3) \mathcal A is r-regular, i.e. every point x\in[n] is contained in exactly r members of \mathcal A. We prove lower bounds on r, and we describe constructions for regular maximal antichains with small regularity.
