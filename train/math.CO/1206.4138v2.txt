The Canada Day Theorem is an identity involving sums of k \times k minors of an arbitrary n \times n symmetric matrix. It was discovered as a by-product of the work on so-called peakon solutions of an integrable nonlinear partial differential equation proposed by V. Novikov. Here we present another proof of this theorem, which explains the underlying mechanism in terms of the orbits of a certain abelian group action on the set of all k-edge matchings of the complete bipartite graph K_{n,n}.
