Let M and N be internally 4-connected binary matroids such that M has a proper N-minor, and |E(N)| is at least seven. As part of our project to develop a splitter theorem for internally 4-connected binary matroids, we prove the following result: if M\e has no N-minor whenever e is in a triangle of M, and M/e has no N-minor whenever e is in a triad of M, then M has a minor, M', such that M' is internally 4-connected with an N-minor, and 0 < |E(M)|-|E(M')| < 3.
