A generalised hexagon of order (s,t) is said to be \emph{extremal} if t meets the Haemers-Roos bound, that is, t=s^3. The \emph{dual twisted triality hexagons} associated to the exceptional Lie type groups \,^3D_4(s) have these parameters, and are the only known such examples. It was shown in the work of De Bruyn and Vanhove that an extremal generalised hexagon has no 1-ovoids. In this note, we prove that a dual twisted triality hexagon has no m-ovoids for every possible (nontrivial) value of m, except for the isolated case where s=3 and m=2.
