Provan and Billera introduced notions of (weak) decomposability of simplicial complexes as a means of attempting to prove polynomial upper bounds on the diameter of the facet-ridge graph of a simplicial polytope. Recently, De Loera and Klee provided the first examples of simplicial polytopes that are not weakly vertex-decomposable. These polytopes are polar to certain simple transportation polytopes. In this paper, we refine their analysis to prove that these d-dimensional polytopes are not even weakly O(\sqrt{d})-decomposable. As a consequence, (weak) decomposability cannot be used to prove a polynomial version of the Hirsch conjecture.
