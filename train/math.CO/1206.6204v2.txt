We give a combinatorial interpretation of a Pieri formula for double Grothendieck polynomials in terms of an interval of the Bruhat order. Another description had been given by Lenart and Postnikov in terms of chain enumerations. We use Lascoux's interpretation of a product of Grothendieck polynomials as a product of two kinds of generators of the 0-Hecke algebra, or sorting operators. In this way we obtain a direct proof of the result of Lenart and Postnikov and then prove that the set of permutations occuring in the result is actually an interval of the Bruhat order.
