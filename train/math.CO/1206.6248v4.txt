For an arbitrary Coxeter group W, David Speyer and Nathan Reading defined Cambrian semilattices C_{\gamma} as semilattice quotients of the weak order on W induced by certain semilattice homomorphisms. In this article, we define an edge-labeling using the realization of Cambrian semilattices in terms of \gamma-sortable elements, and show that this is an EL-labeling for every closed interval of C_{\gamma}. In addition, we use our labeling to show that every finite open interval in a Cambrian semilattice is either contractible or spherical, and we characterize the spherical intervals, generalizing a result by Nathan Reading.
