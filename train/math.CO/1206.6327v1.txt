A radio labeling of a connected graph G is a function c:V(G) \to \mathbb Z_+ such that for every two distinct vertices u and v of G \text{distance}(u,v)+|c(u)-c(v)|\geq 1+ \text{diameter}(G). The radio number of a graph G is the smallest integer M for which there exists a labeling c with c(v)\leq M for all v\in V(G). The radio number of graphs of order n and diameter n-1, i.e., paths, was determined in \cite{paths}. Here we determine the radio numbers of all graphs of order n and diameter n-2.
