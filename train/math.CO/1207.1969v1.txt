A {\sf \mu-way Latin trade} of volume s is a collection of \mu partial Latin squares T_1,T_2,...,T_{\mu}, containing exactly the same s filled cells, such that if cell (i, j) is filled, it contains a different entry in each of the \mu partial Latin squares, and such that row i in each of the \mu partial Latin squares contains, set-wise, the same symbols and column j, likewise. %If \mu=2, (T_1,T_2) is called a {\sf Latin bitrade}. It is called {\sf \mu-way k-homogeneous Latin trade}, if in each row and each column T_r, for 1\le r\le \mu, contains exactly k elements, and each element appears in T_r exactly k times. It is also denoted by (\mu,k,m) Latin trade,where m is the size of partial Latin squares.   We introduce some general constructions for \mu-way k-homogeneous Latin trades and specifically show that for all k \le m, 6\le k \le 13 and k=15, and for all k \le m, k = 4, \ 5 (except for four specific values), a 3-way k-homogeneous Latin trade of volume km exists. We also show that there are no (3,4,6) Latin trade and (3,4,7) Latin trade. Finally we present general results on the existence of 3-way k-homogeneous Latin trades for some modulo classes of m.
