This paper is continuation of the systematic study of distribution of quadrant marked mesh patterns initiated in "S. Kitaev and J. Remmel, Quadrant marked mesh patterns, J. Integer Sequences 12, Issue 4 (2012), Article 12.4.7.". We study quadrant marked mesh patterns on up-down and down-up permutations.
