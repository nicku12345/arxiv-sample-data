Let \mathcal{F}=\{F_1,F_2, \ldots,F_n\} be a family of n sets on a ground set S, such as a family of balls in \mathbb{R}^d. For every finite measure \mu on S, such that the sets of \mathcal{F} are measurable, the classical inclusion-exclusion formula asserts that \mu(F_1\cup F_2\cup\cdots\cup F_n)=\sum_{I:\emptyset\ne I\subseteq[n]} (-1)^{|I|+1}\mu\Bigl(\bigcap_{i\in I} F_i\Bigr); that is, the measure of the union is expressed using measures of various intersections. The number of terms in this formula is exponential in n, and a significant amount of research, originating in applied areas, has been devoted to constructing simpler formulas for particular families \mathcal{F}. We provide an upper bound valid for an arbitrary \mathcal{F}: we show that every system \mathcal{F} of n sets with m nonempty fields in the Venn diagram admits an inclusion-exclusion formula with m^{O(\log^2n)} terms and with \pm1 coefficients, and that such a formula can be computed in m^{O(\log^2n)} expected time. For every \varepsilon>0 we also construct systems with Venn diagram of size m for which every valid inclusion-exclusion formula has the sum of absolute values of the coefficients at least \Omega(m^{2-\varepsilon}).
