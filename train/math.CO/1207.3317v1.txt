For two sets A and M of positive integers and for a positive integer n, let p(n,A,M) denote the number of partitions of n with parts in A and multiplicities in M, that is, the number of representations of n in the form n=\sum_{a \in A} m_a a where m_a \in M \cup {0} for all a, and all numbers m_a but finitely many are 0. It is shown that there are infinite sets A and M so that p(n,A,M)=1 for every positive integer n. This settles (in a strong form) a problem of Canfield and Wilf. It is also shown that there is an infinite set M and constants c and n_0 so that for A={k!}_{k \geq 1} or for A=\{k^k\}_{k \geq 1}, 0<p(n,A,M) \leq n^c for all n>n_0. This answers a question of Ljuji\'c and Nathanson.
