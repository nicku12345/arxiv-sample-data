We study the root polytope \mathcal P_\Phi of a finite irreducible crystallographic root system \Phi using its relation with the abelian ideals of a Borel subalgebra of a simple Lie algebra with root system \Phi. We determine the hyperplane arrangement corresponding to the faces of codimension 2 of \mathcal P_\Phi and analyze its relation with the facets of \mathcal P_\Phi. For \Phi of type A_n or C_n, we show that the orbits of some special subsets of abelian ideals under the action of the Weyl group parametrize a triangulation of \mathcal P_\Phi. We show that this triangulation restricts to a triangulation of the positive root polytope \mathcal P_\Phi^+.
