A well-known theorem of de Bruijn and Erd\H{o}s states that any set of n non-collinear points in the plane determines at least n lines. Chen and Chv\'{a}tal asked whether an analogous statement holds within the framework of finite metric spaces, with lines defined using the notion of {\em betweenness}.   In this paper, we prove that the answer is affirmative for sets of n points in the plane with the L_1 metric, provided that no two points share their x- or y-coordinate. In this case, either there is a line that contains all n points, or X induces at least n distinct lines.   If points of X are allowed to share their coordinates, then either there is a line that contains all n points, or X induces at least n/37 distinct lines.
