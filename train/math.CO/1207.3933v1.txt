In earlier papers we have developed an algebraic theory of discrete tomography. In those papers the structure of the functions f: A \to \{0,1\} and f: A \to \mathbb{Z} having given line sums in certain directions have been analyzed. Here A was a block in \mathbb{Z}^n with sides parallel to the axes. In the present paper we assume that there is noise in the measurements and (only) that A is an arbitrary or convex finite set in \mathbb{Z}^n. We derive generalizations of earlier results. Furthermore we apply a method of Beck and Fiala to obtain results of he following type: if the line sums in k directions of a function h: A \to [0,1] are known, then there exists a function f: A \to \{0,1\} such that its line sums differ by at most k from the corresponding line sums of h.
