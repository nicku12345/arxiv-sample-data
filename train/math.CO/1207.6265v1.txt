Maximal green sequences are particular sequences of mutations which were introduced by Keller in the context of quantum dilogarithm identities and independently by Cecotti-Cordova-Vafa in the context of supersymmetric gauge theory. In this paper, we show that skew-symmetrizable 3x3 matrices with a mutation-cyclic diagram do not have any maximal green sequences. We also obtain some properties of maximal green sequences of skew-symmetrizable 3x3 matrices with mutation-acyclic diagrams.
