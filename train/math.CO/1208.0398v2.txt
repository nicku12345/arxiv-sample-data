Let U_5 be the tournament with vertices v_1, ..., v_5 such that v_2 \rightarrow v_1, and v_i \rightarrow v_j if j-i \equiv 1, 2 \pmod{5} and {i,j} \neq {1,2}. In this paper we describe the tournaments which do not have U_5 as a subtournament. Specifically, we show that if a tournament G is "prime"---that is, if there is no subset X \subseteq V(G), 1 < |X| < |V(G)|, such that for all v \in V(G) \backslash X, either v \rightarrow x for all x \in X or x \rightarrow v for all x \in X---then G is U_5-free if and only if either G is a specific tournament T_n or V(G) can be partitioned into sets X, Y, Z such that X \cup Y, Y \cup Z, and Z \cup X are transitive. From the prime U_5-free tournaments we can construct all the U_5-free tournaments. We use the theorem to show that every U_5-free tournament with n vertices has a transitive subtournament with at least n^{\log_3 2} vertices, and that this bound is tight.
