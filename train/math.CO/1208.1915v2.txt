A sequence x=x_1 x_2...x_n  is said to be an ascent sequence of length n if it satisfies x_1=0 and 0\leq x_i\leq asc(x_1x_2...x_{i-1})+1 for all 2\leq i\leq n, where asc(x_1x_2... x_{i-1}) is the number of ascents in the sequence x_1x_2... x_{i-1}. Recently, Duncan and Steingr\'{\i}msson proposed the conjecture that 210-avoiding ascent sequences of length n are equinumerous with 3-nonnesting set partitions of \{1,2,..., n\}. In this paper, we confirm this conjecture by showing that 210-avoiding ascent sequences of length n are in bijection with 3-nonnesting set partitions of \{1,2,..., n\} via an intermediate structure of growth diagrams for 01-fillings of Ferrers shapes.
