A generalized balanced tournament design, or a GBTD(k, m) in short, is a (km, k, k-1)-BIBD defined on a km-set V . Its blocks can be arranged into an m\times(km-1) array in such a way that (1) every element of V is contained in exactly one cell of each column, and (2) every element of V is contained in at most k cells of each row. In this paper, we present a new construction for GBTDs and show that a GBTD(p,p) exists for any prime number p \geq 3.
