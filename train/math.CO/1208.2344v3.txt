In the paper we find new inequalities involving the intersections A\cap (A-x) of shifts of some subset A from an abelian group. We apply the inequalities to obtain new upper bounds for the additive energy of multiplicative subgroups and convex sets and also a series another results on the connection of the additive energy and so--called higher moments of convolutions. Besides we prove new theorems on multiplicative subgroups concerning lower bounds for its doubling constants, sharp lower bound for the cardinality of sumset of a multiplicative subgroup and its subprogression and another results.
