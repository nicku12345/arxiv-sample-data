We consider the problem of counting the number of linear transformation shift registers (TSRs) of a given order over a finite field. We derive explicit formulae for the number of irreducible TSRs of order two. An interesting connection between TSRs and self-reciprocal polynomials is outlined. We use this connection and our results on TSRs to deduce a theorem of Carlitz on the number of self-reciprocal irreducible monic polynomials of a given degree over a finite field.
