We study the problem of expanding the product of two Stanley symmetric functions F_w\cdot F_u into Stanley symmetric functions in some natural way. Our approach is to consider a Stanley symmetric function as a stabilized Schubert polynomial F_{w}=\lim_{n\to \infty}\mathfrak{S}_{1^{n}\times w}, and study the behavior of the expansion of \s_{1^n\times w}\cdot\s_{1^n\times u} into Schubert polynomials, as n increases. We prove that this expansion stabilizes and thus we get a natural expansion for the product of two Stanley symmetric functions. In the case when one permutation is Grassmannian, we have a better understanding of this stability. We then study some other related stable properties, which provides a second proof of the main result.
