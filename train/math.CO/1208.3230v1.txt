A permutation snark is a snark which has a 2-factor F_2 consisting of two chordless circuits; F_2 is called the permutation 2-factor of G. We construct an infinite family \mathcal H of cyclically 5-edge connected permutation snarks. Moreover, we prove for every member G \in \mathcal H that the permutation 2-factor given by the construction of G is not contained in any circuit double cover of G.
