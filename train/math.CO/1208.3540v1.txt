We consider the equivalence relation ~ on the symmetric group S_n generated by the interchange of two adjacent elements a_i and a_{i+1} of w=a_1 ... a_n in S_n such that |a_i - a_{i+1}|=1. We count the number of equivalence classes and the sizes of equivalence classes. The results are generalized to permutations of multisets using umbral techniques. In the original problem, the equivalence class containing the identity permutation is the set of linear extensions of a certain poset. Further investigation yields a characterization of all finite graded posets whose flag h-vector takes on only the values -1, 0, 1.
