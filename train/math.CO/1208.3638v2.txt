In this paper we adapt techniques used by Ahlswede and Khachatrian in their proof of the Complete Erd\H{o}s-Ko-Rado Theorem to show that if n \geq 2t+1, then any pairwise t-cycle-intersecting family of permutations has cardinality less than or equal to (n-t)!. Furthermore, the only families attaining this size are the stabilizers of t points, that is, families consisting of all permutations having t 1-cycles in common. This is a strengthening of a previous result of Ku and Renshaw and supports a recent conjecture by Ellis, Friedgut and Pilpel concerning the corresponding bound for t-intersecting families of permutations.
