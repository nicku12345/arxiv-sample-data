We confirm Sun's conjecture that (\root{n+1}\of{F_{n+1}}/\root{n}\of{F_n})_{n\ge 4} is strictly decreasing to the limit 1, where (F_n)_{n\ge0} is the Fibonacci sequence. We also prove that the sequence (\root{n+1}\of{D_{n+1}}/\root{n}\of{D_n})_{n\ge3} is strictly decreasing with limit 1, where D_n is the n-th derangement number. For m-th order harmonic numbers H_n^{(m)}=\sum_{k=1}^n 1/k^m\ (n=1,2,3,\ldots), we show that (\root{n+1}\of{H^{(m)}_{n+1}}/\root{n}\of{H^{(m)}_n})_{n\ge3} is strictly increasing.
