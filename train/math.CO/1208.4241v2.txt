Given a finite poset P, we consider the largest size \lanp of a family \F of subsets of [n]:=\{1,...,n\} that contains no subposet P. This continues the study of the asymptotic growth of \lanp; it has been conjectured that for all P, \pi(P):= \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty} \lanp/\nchn exists and equals a certain integer, e(P). While this is known to be true for paths, and several more general families of posets, for the simple diamond poset \D_2, the existence of \pi frustratingly remains open. Here we develop theory to show that \pi(P) exists and equals the conjectured value e(P) for many new posets P. We introduce a hierarchy of properties for posets, each of which implies \pi=e, and some implying more precise information about \lanp. The properties relate to the Lubell function of a family \F of subsets, which is the average number of times a random full chain meets \F. We present an array of examples and constructions that possess the properties.
