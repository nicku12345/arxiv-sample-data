A signed graph is a pair (G,\Sigma), where G=(V,E) is a graph (in which parallel edges are permitted, but loops are not) with V={1,...,n} and \Sigma\subseteq E. By S(G,\Sigma) we denote the set of all symmetric V\times V matrices A=[a_{i,j}] with a_{i,j}<0 if i and j are connected by only even edges, a_{i,j}>0 if i and j are connected by only odd edges, a_{i,j}\in \mathbb{R} if i and j are connected by both even and odd edges, a_{i,j}=0 if i\not=j and i and j are non-adjacent, and a_{i,i} \in \mathbb{R} for all vertices i. The stable inertia set of a signed graph (G,\Sigma) is the set of all pairs (p,q) for which there exists a matrix A\in S(G,\Sigma) with p positive and q negative eigenvalues which has the Strong Arnold Property. In this paper, we study the stable inertia set of (signed) graphs.
