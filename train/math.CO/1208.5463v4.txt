In 1973, Chv\'{a}tal introduced the concept of toughness \tau of a graph and constructed an infinite class of nonhamiltonian graphs with \tau=3/2. Later Thomassen found nonhamiltonian graphs with \tau>3/2, and Enomoto et al. constructed nonhamiltonian graphs with \tau=2-\epsilon for each positive \epsilon. The last result in this direction is due to Bauer, Broersma and Veldman, which states that for each positive \epsilon, there exists a nonhamiltonian graph with \tau\ge 9/4-\epsilon. In this paper we prove that for each rational number t with 0<t<9/4, there exists a nonhamiltonian graph with \tau=t.
