Let G be a connected graph with vertex set V and a {\em weight function} \rho that assigns a nonnegative number to each of its vertices. Then, the {\em \rho-moment} of G at vertex u is defined to be M_G^{\rho}(u)=\sum_{v\in V} \rho(v)\dist (u,v) , where \dist(\cdot,\cdot) stands for the distance function. Adding up all these numbers, we obtain the {\em \rho-moment of G}:  M_G^{\rho}=\sum_{u\in V}M_G^{\rho}(u)=1/2\sum_{u,v\in V}\dist(u,v)[\rho(u)+\rho(v)].  This parameter generalizes, or it is closely related to, some well-known graph invariants, such as the {\em Wiener index} W(G), when \rho(u)=1/2 for every u\in V, and the {\em degree distance} D'(G), obtained when \rho(u)=\delta(u), the degree of vertex u. In this paper we derive some exact formulas for computing the \rho-moment of a graph obtained by a general operation called graft product, which can be seen as a generalization of the hierarchical product, in terms of the corresponding \rho-moments of its factors. As a consequence, we provide a method for obtaining nonisomorphic graphs with the same \rho-moment for every \rho (and hence with equal mean distance, Wiener index, degree distance, etc.). In the case when the factors are trees and/or cycles, techniques from linear algebra allow us to give formulas for the degree distance of their product.
