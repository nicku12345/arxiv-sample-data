We extend the concept of pattern avoidance in permutations on a totally ordered set to pattern avoidance in permutations on partially ordered sets. The number of permutations on P that avoid the pattern \pi is denoted Av_P(\pi). We extend a proof of Simion and Schmidt to show that Av_P(132) \leq Av_P(123) for any poset P, and we exactly classify the posets for which equality holds.
