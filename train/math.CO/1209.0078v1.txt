In the study of Zeilberger's conjecture on an integer sequence related to the Catalan numbers, Lassalle proposed the following conjecture. Let (t)_n denote the rising factorial, and let \Lambda_{\mathbb{R}} denote the algebra of symmetric functions with real coefficients. If \varphi is the homomorphism from \Lambda_{\mathbb{R}} to \mathbb{R} defined by \varphi(h_n)={1}/{((t)_nn!)} for some t>0, then for any Schur function s_{\lambda}, the value \varphi(s_{\lambda}) is positive. In this paper, we provide an affirmative answer to Lassalle's conjecture by using the Laguerre-P\'olya-Schur theory of multiplier sequences.
