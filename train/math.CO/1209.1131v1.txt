When numbers are added in base b in the usual way, carries occur. If two random, independent 1-digit numbers are added, then the probability of a carry is \frac{b-1}{2b}. Other choices of digits lead to less carries. In particular, if for odd b we use the digits \{-(b-1)/2, -(b-3)/2,...,...(b-1)/2\} then the probability of carry is only \frac{b^2-1}{4b^2}. Diaconis, Shao and Soundararajan conjectured that this is the best choice of digits, and proved that this is asymptotically the case when b=p is a large prime. In this note we prove this conjecture for all odd primes p.
