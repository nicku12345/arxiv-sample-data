By considering Eulerian numbers and ordered Stirling numbers of the second and third kinds over a multiset, we generalize identities of Eulerian numbers and Stirling numbers of the second and third kinds and provide q-analogs of these generalizations. Using these generalizations, we also compute Eulerian numbers and ordered Stirling numbers of the second kind over a multiset.
