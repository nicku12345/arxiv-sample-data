A configuration of the lit-only \sigma-game on a graph \Gamma is an assignment of one of two states, {\it on} or {\it off}, to each vertex of \Gamma. Given a configuration, a move of the lit-only \sigma-game on \Gamma allows the player to choose an {\it on} vertex s of \Gamma and change the states of all neighbors of s. Given an integer k, the underlying graph \Gamma is said to be k-lit if for any configuration, the number of {\it on} vertices can be reduced to at most k by a finite sequence of moves. We give a description of the orbits of the lit-only \sigma-game on nondegenerate graphs \Gamma which are not line graphs. We show that these graphs \Gamma are 2-lit and provide a linear algebraic criterion for \Gamma to be 1-lit.
