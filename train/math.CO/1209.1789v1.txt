For any flag simplicial complex \Theta obtained by stellar subdividing the boundary of the cross polytope in edges, we define a flag simplicial complex \Gamma(\Theta) (dependent on the sequence of subdivisions) whose f-vector is the \gamma-vector of \Theta. This proves that the \gamma-vector of any such simplicial complex satisfies the Frankl-F\"{u}redi-Kalai inequalities, partially solving a conjecture by Nevo and Petersen \cite{np}. We show that when \Theta is the dual simplicial complex to a nestohedron, and the sequence of subdivisions corresponds to a flag ordering as defined in \cite{ai}, that \Gamma(\Theta) is equal to the flag simplical complex defined there.
