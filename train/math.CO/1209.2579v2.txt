Subgroups of the symmetric group S_n act on powers of chains C^n by permuting coordinates, and induce automorphisms of the ordered sets C^n. The quotients defined are candidates for symmetric chain decompositions. We establish this for some families of groups in order to enlarge the collection of subgroups G of the symmetric group S_n for which the quotient B_n/G obtained from the G-orbits on the Boolean lattice B_n is a symmetric chain order. The methods are also used to provide an elementary proof that quotients of powers of SCOs by cyclic groups are SCOs.
