The lth partial barycentric subdivision is defined for a (d-1)-dimensional simplicial complex \Delta and studied along with its combinatorial, geometric and algebraic aspects. We analyze the behavior of the f- and h-vector under the lth partial barycentric subdivision extending previous work of Brenti and Welker on the standard barycentric subdivision -- the case l = 1. We discuss and provide properties of the transformation matrices sending the f- and h-vector of \Delta to the f- and h-vector of its lth partial barycentric subdivision. We conclude with open problems.
