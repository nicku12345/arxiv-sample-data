Let P be a locally finite poset with the interval space \Int(P), and R a ring with identity. We shall introduce the M\"{o}bius conjugation \mu^\ast sending each function f:P\to R to an incidence function \mu^\ast(f):\Int(P)\to R such that \mu^\ast(fg)=\mu^\ast(f)\ast\mu^\ast(g). Taking P to be the intersection poset of a hyperplane arrangement \mathcal{A}, we shall obtain a convolution identity for the number r(\mathcal{A}) of regions and the number b(\mathcal{A}) of relatively bounded regions, and a reciprocity theorem of the characteristic polynomial \chi(\mathcal{A},t), which also leads to a combinatorial interpretation to the values |\chi(\mathcal{A},-q)| for large primes q. Moreover, all known convolution identities on Tutte polynomials of matroids will be direct consequences after specializing the poset P and functions f,g.
