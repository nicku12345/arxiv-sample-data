In this paper we study the behaviour of the domination number of the Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graph \mathcal{G}(n,p). Extending a result of Wieland and Godbole we show that the domination number of \mathcal{G}(n,p) is equal to one of two values asymptotically almost surely whenever p \gg \frac{\ln^2n}{\sqrt{n}}. The explicit values are exactly at the first moment threshold, that is where the expected number of dominating sets starts to tend to infinity. For small p we also provide various non-concentration results which indicate why some sort of lower bound on the probability p is necessary in our first theorem. Concentration, though not on a constant length interval, is proven for every p\gg 1/n. These results show that unlike in the case of p \gg \frac{\ln^2n}{\sqrt{n}} where concentration of the domination number happens around the first moment threshold, for p = O(\ln n/n) it does so around the median. In particular, in this range the two are far apart from each other.
