Given g\ge 1, the number n(g) of numerical semigroups S \subset \N of genus |\N \setminus S| equal to g is the subject of challenging conjectures of Bras-Amor\'os. In this paper, we focus on the counting function n(g,2) of \textit{two-generator} numerical semigroups of genus g, which is known to also count certain special factorizations of 2g. Further focusing on the case g=p^k for any odd prime p and k \ge 1, we show that n(p^k,2) only depends on the class of p modulo a certain explicit modulus M(k). The main ingredient is a reduction of \gcd(p^\alpha+1, 2p^\beta+1) to a simpler form, using the continued fraction of \alpha/\beta. We treat the case k=9 in detail and show explicitly how n(p^9,2) depends on the class of p mod M(9)=3 \cdot 5 \cdot 11 \cdot 17 \cdot 43 \cdot 257.
