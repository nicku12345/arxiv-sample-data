This is a continuation of the early paper concerning matroid base polytope decomposition. Here, we will present sufficient conditions on M so its base matroid polytope P(M) has a {\em sequence} of hyperplane splits. The latter yields to decompositions of P(M) with two or more pieces for infinitely many matroids M. We also present necessary conditions on the Euclidean representation of rank three matroids M for the existences of decompositions of P(M) into 2 or 3 pieces. Finally, we prove that P(M_1 \oplus M_2) has a sequence of hyperplane splits if either P(M_1) or P(M_2) also has a sequence of hyperplane splits.
