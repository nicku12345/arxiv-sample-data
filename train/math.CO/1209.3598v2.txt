Let W_n(p,q) denote the minimum number of edges in an n x n bipartite graph G on vertex sets X,Y that satisfies the following condition; one can add the edges between X and Y that do not belong to G one after the other so that whenever a new edge is added, a new copy of K_{p,q} is created. The problem of bounding W_n(p,q), and its natural hypergraph generalization, was introduced by Balogh, Bollob\'as, Morris and Riordan. Their main result, specialized to graphs, used algebraic methods to determine W_n(1,q).   Our main results in this paper give exact bounds for W_n(p,q), its hypergraph analogue, as well as for a new variant of Bollob\'as's Two Families theorem. In particular, we completely determine W_n(p,q), showing that if 1 <= p <= q <= n then   W_n(p,q) = n^2 - (n-p+1)^2 + (q-p)^2.   Our proof applies a reduction to a multi-partite version of the Two Families theorem obtained by Alon. While the reduction is combinatorial, the main idea behind it is algebraic.
