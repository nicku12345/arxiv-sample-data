Let G be a graph on n\geq 3 vertices, claw the bipartite graph K_{1,3}, and Z_i the graph obtained from a triangle by attaching a path of length i to its one vertex. G is called 1-heavy if at least one end vertex of each induced claw of G has degree at least n/2, and claw-\emph{o}-heavy if each induced claw of it has a pair of end vertices with degree sum at least n. In this paper we prove two results: (1) Every 2-connected claw-o-heavy graph G is Hamiltonian if every pair of vertices u,v in a subgraph H\cong Z_1 contained in an induced subgraph Z_2 of G with d_{H}(u,v)=2 satisfies one of the following conditions: (a) |N(u)\cap N(v)|\geq 2; (b) \max(d(u),d(v))\geq n/2. (2) Every 3-connected 1-heavy graph G is Hamiltonian if every pair of vertices u,v in an induced subgraph H\cong Z_2 of G with d_{H}(u,v)=2 satisfies one of the following conditions: (a) |N(u)\cap N(v)|\geq 2; (b) \max(d(u),d(v))\geq n/2. Our results improve or extend previous theorems of Broersma et al., Chen et al., Fan, Goodman & Hedetniemi, Gould & Jacobson and Shi on the existence of Hamilton cycles in graphs.
