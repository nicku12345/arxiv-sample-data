Let D be a strong digraph on n\geq 4 vertices. In [3, Discrete Applied Math., 95 (1999) 77-87)], J. Bang-Jensen, Y. Guo and A. Yeo proved the following theorem: if (*) d(x)+d(y)\geq 2n-1 and min \{d^+(x)+ d^-(y),d^-(x)+ d^+(y)\}\geq n-1 for every pair of non-adjacent vertices x, y with a common in-neighbour or a common out-neighbour, then D is hamiltonian. In this note we show that: if D is not directed cycle and satisfies the condition (*), then D contains a cycle of length n-1 or n-2.
