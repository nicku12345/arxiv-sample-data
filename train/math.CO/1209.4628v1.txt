A signed graph is a pair (G,\Sigma), where G=(V,E) is a graph (in which parallel edges are permitted, but loops are not) with V=\{1,...,n\} and \Sigma\subseteq E. The edges in \Sigma are called odd and the other edges even. By S(G,\Sigma) we denote the set of all symmetric n\times n matrices A=[a_{i,j}] with a_{i,j}<0 if i and j are connected by only even edges, a_{i,j}>0 if i and j are connected by only odd edges, a_{i,j}\in \mathbb{R} if i and j are connected by both even and odd edges, a_{i,j}=0 if i\not=j and i and j are non-adjacent, and a_{i,i} \in \mathbb{R} for all vertices i. The parameter \nu(G,\Sigma) of a signed graph (G,\Sigma) is the largest nullity of any positive semidefinite matrix A\in S(G,\Sigma) that has the Strong Arnold Property. By K_3^= we denote the signed graph obtained from (K_3,\emptyset) by adding to each even edge an odd edge in parallel. In this paper, we prove that a signed graph (G,\Sigma) has \nu(G,\Sigma)\leq 2 if and only if (G,\Sigma) has no minor isomorphic to (K_4,E(K_4)) or K_3^=.
