Given simple graphs G_1 and G_2, the neighbourhood corona of G_1 and G_2, denoted G_1\star G_2, is the graph obtained by taking one copy of G_1 and |V(G_1)| copies of G_2, and joining the neighbours of the ith vertex of G_1 to every vertex in the ith copy of G_2. In this paper we determine the adjacency spectrum of G_1 \star G_2 for arbitrary G_1 and G_2, and the Laplacian spectrum and signless Laplacian spectrum of G_1\star G_2 for regular G_1 and arbitrary G_2, in terms of the corresponding spectrum of G_1 and G_2. The results on the adjacency and signless Laplacian spectra enable us to construct new pairs of adjacency cospectral and signless Laplacian cospectral graphs. As applications of the results on the Laplacian spectra, we give constructions of new families of expander graphs from known ones by using neighbourhood coronae.
