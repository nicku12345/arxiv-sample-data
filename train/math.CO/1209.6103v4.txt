W. T. Gowers proved that every Lipschitz function from the unit sphere of the Banach space c_0 to \mathbb{R} is oscilation stable. His proof uses a result about finite partitions of the set FIN_k of finitely supported functions p from \mathbb{N} to \{0,1,...,k\} with k in Im(p). Every known proof of this fact uses methods of topological dynamics on the space \beta\mathbb{N} of ultrafilters on \mathbb{N}. We give a purely combinatorial proof of this result avoiding the use of ultrafilters.
