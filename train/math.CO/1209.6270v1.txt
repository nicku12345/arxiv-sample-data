This paper proves explicit formulas for the number of dissections of a convex regular polygon modulo the action of the cyclic and dihedral groups. The formulas are obtained by making use of the Cauchy-Frobenius Lemma as well as bijections between rotationally symmetric dissections and simpler classes of dissections. A number of special cases of these formulas are studied. Consequently, some known enumerations are recovered and several new ones are provided.
