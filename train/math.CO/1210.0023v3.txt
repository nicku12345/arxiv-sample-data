In this paper we establish a variation of the Splitter Theorem. Let M and N be simple 3-connected matroids. We say that x\in E(M) is vertically N-contractible if si(M/x) is a 3-connected matroid with an N-minor. Whittle (for k=1,2) and Costalonga(for k=3) proved that, if r(M)- r(N)\ge k, then M has a k-independent set I of vertically N-contractible elements. Costalonga also characterized an obstruction for the existence of such a 4-independent set I in the binary case, provided r(M)-r(N)\ge 5, and improved this result when r(M)-r(N)\ge 6, and in the graphic case. In this paper we generalize the results of Costalonga to the non-binary case.   Moreover, we apply our results to the study of properties similar to 3-roundedness in classes of matroids.
