This paper continues investigation of the class of flag simple polytopes called 2-truncated cubes. It is an extended version of the short note Volodin (2012). A 2-truncated cube is a polytope obtained from a cube by sequence of truncations of codimension 2 faces. Constructed uniquely defined function which maps any 2-truncated cube to a flag simplicial complex with f-vector equal to \gamma-vector of the polytope. As a corollary we obtain that \gamma-vectors of 2-truncated cubes satisfy Frankl-Furedi-Kalai inequalities.
