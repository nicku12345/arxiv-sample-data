A notion of an i-banner simplicial complex is introduced. For various values of i, these complexes interpolate between the class of flag complexes and the class of all simplicial complexes. Examples of simplicial spheres of an arbitrary dimension that are (i+1)-banner but not i-banner are constructed. It is shown that several theorems for flag complexes have appropriate i-banner analogues. Among them are (1) the codimension-(i+j-1) skeleton of an i-banner homology sphere \Delta is 2(i+j)-Cohen--Macaulay for all 0\leq j\leq \dim\Delta+1-i, and (2) for every i-banner simplicial complex \Delta there exists a balanced complex \Gamma with the same number of vertices as \Delta whose face numbers of dimension i-1 and higher coincide with those of \Delta.
