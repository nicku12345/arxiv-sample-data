Let G=(V,E) be a graph of order n. A distance magic labeling of G is a bijection \ell \colon V\rightarrow {1,...,n} for which there exists a positive integer k such that \sum_{x\in N(v)}\ell (x)=k for all v\in V , where N(v) is the neighborhood of v. We introduce a natural subclass of distance magic graphs. For this class we show that it is closed for the direct product with regular graphs and closed as a second factor for lexicographic product with regular graphs. In addition, we characterize distance magic graphs among direct product of two cycles.
