Let P be a point of the Veronese surface \Vcal in \PG53. Then thereare four conics of \Vcal through P. We show that the internal points of those conics form a 12-cap which is a point model for Witt's 5-(12,6,1) design. In fact, this construction is "dual" to a similar construction that has been established by the author. We give an explicit parametrization of the cap \Kcal; the domain is a dual affine plane which arises from \PG23 by removing one point. Thus, as a by--product, we obtain an easy approach to the extended ternary Golay code G_{12}. Finally, we discuss some other procedures that yield 12-sets of points from the Veronese surface.
