We study a certain family of discrete dynamical processes introduced by Novikoff, Kleinberg and Strogatz that we call flashcard games. We prove a number of results on the evolution of these games, an in particular we settle a conjecture of NKS on the frequency with which a given card appears. We introduce a number of generalizations and variations that we believe are of interest, and provide a large number of open questions and problems.
