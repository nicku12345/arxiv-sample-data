A pattern \tau is a permutation, and an arithmetic occurrence of \tau in (another) permutation \pi=\pi_1\pi_2...\pi_n is a subsequence \pi_{i_1}\pi_{i_2}...\pi_{i_m} of \pi that is order isomorphic to \tau where the numbers i_1<i_2<...<i_m form an arithmetic progression. A permutation is (k,\ell)-crucial if it avoids arithmetically the patterns 12... k and \ell(\ell-1)... 1 but its extension to the right by any element does not avoid arithmetically these patterns. A (k,\ell)-crucial permutation that cannot be extended to the left without creating an arithmetic occurrence of 12... k or \ell(\ell-1)... 1 is called (k,\ell)-bicrucial.   In this paper we prove that arbitrary long (k,\ell)-crucial and (k,\ell)-bicrucial permutations exist for any k,\ell\geq 3. Moreover, we show that the minimal length of a (k,\ell)-crucial permutation is \max(k,\ell)(\min(k,\ell)-1), while the minimal length of a (k,\ell)-bicrucial permutation is at most 2\max(k,\ell)(\min(k,\ell)-1), again for k,\ell\geq3.
