In this paper, we present constructions of abelian Paley type group schemes by using multiplicative characters of finite fields and Arasu-Dillon-Player difference sets. The constructions produce many new Paley type group schemes that were previous unknown in our classification of Paley type group schemes in finite fields of small orders.
