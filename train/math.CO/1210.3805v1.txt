For an odd integer k, let \mathcal{C}_k = \{C_3,C_5,...,C_k\} denote the family of all odd cycles of length at most k and let \mathcal{C} denote the family of all odd cycles. Erd\H{o}s and Simonovits \cite{ESi1} conjectured that for every family \mathcal{F} of bipartite graphs, there exists k such that \ex{n}{\mathcal{F} \cup \mathcal{C}_k} \sim \ex{n}{\mathcal{F} \cup \mathcal{C}} as n \rightarrow \infty. This conjecture was proved by Erd\H{o}s and Simonovits when \mathcal{F} = \{C_4\}, and for certain families of even cycles in \cite{KSV}. In this paper, we give a general approach to the conjecture using Scott's sparse regularity lemma. Our approach proves the conjecture for complete bipartite graphs K_{2,t} and K_{3,3}: we obtain more strongly that for any odd k \geq 5, \[ \ex{n}{\mathcal{F} \cup \{C_k\}} \sim \ex{n}{\mathcal{F} \cup \mathcal{C}}\] and we show further that the extremal graphs can be made bipartite by deleting very few edges. In contrast, this formula does not extend to triangles -- the case k = 3 -- and we give an algebraic construction for odd t \geq 3 of K_{2,t}-free C_3-free graphs with substantially more edges than an extremal K_{2,t}-free bipartite graph on n vertices. Our general approach to the Erd\H{o}s-Simonovits conjecture is effective based on some reasonable assumptions on the maximum number of edges in an m by n bipartite \mathcal{F}-free graph.
