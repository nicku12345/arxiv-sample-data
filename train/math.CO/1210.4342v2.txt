In this paper we consider biased Maker-Breaker games played on the edge set of a given graph G. We prove that for every \delta>0 and large enough n, there exists a constant k for which if \delta(G)\geq \delta n and \chi(G)\geq k, then Maker can build an odd cycle in the (1:b) game for b=O(\frac{n}{\log^2 n}). We also consider the analogous game where Maker and Breaker claim vertices instead of edges. This is a special case of the following well known and notoriously difficult problem due to Duffus, {\L}uczak and R\"{o}dl: is it true that for any positive constants t and b, there exists an integer k such that for every graph G, if \chi(G)\geq k, then Maker can build a graph which is not t-colorable, in the (1:b) Maker-Breaker game played on the vertices of G?
