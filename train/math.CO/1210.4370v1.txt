We prove the existence of infinite classes of cyclic G-decompositions of the complete multipartite graph, G being a caterpillar, a hairy cycle or a cycle. All the results are obtained by the construction of d-divisible \alpha-labelings of G, introduced in [A. Pasotti, On d-graceful labelings, to appear on Ars Combin.] as a generalization of classical \alpha-labelings, whose existence implies that one of graph decompositions.
