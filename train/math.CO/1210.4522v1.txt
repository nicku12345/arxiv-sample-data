We show that, if \alpha > 0 is a real number, n \ge 2 and \ell \ge 2 are integers, and q is a prime power, then every simple matroid M of sufficiently large rank, with no U_{2,\ell}-minor, no rank-n projective geometry minor over a larger field than \GF(q), and satisfying |M| \ge \alpha q^{r(M)}, has a rank-n affine geometry restriction over \GF(q). This result can be viewed as an analogue of the Multidimensional Density Hales-Jewett Theorem for matroids.
