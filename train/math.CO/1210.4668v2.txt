In this paper we introduce the concept of minimum-weight edge-discriminators in hypergraphs, and study its various properties. For a hypergraph \mathcal H=(\mathcal V, \mathcal E), a function \lambda: \mathcal V\rightarrow \mathbb Z^{+}\cup\{0\} is said to be an {\it edge-discriminator} on \mathcal H if \sum_{v\in E_i}{\lambda(v)}>0, for all hyperedges E_i\in \mathcal E, and \sum_{v\in E_i}{\lambda(v)}\ne \sum_{v\in E_j}{\lambda(v)}, for every two distinct hyperedges E_i, E_j \in \mathcal E. An {\it optimal edge-discriminator} on \mathcal H, to be denoted by \lambda_\mathcal H, is an edge-discriminator on \mathcal H satisfying \sum_{v\in \mathcal V}\lambda_\mathcal H (v)=\min_\lambda\sum_{v\in \mathcal V}{\lambda(v)}, where the minimum is taken over all edge-discriminators on \mathcal H. We prove that any hypergraph \mathcal H=(\mathcal V, \mathcal E), with |\mathcal E|=n, satisfies \sum_{v\in \mathcal V} \lambda_\mathcal H(v)\leq n(n+1)/2, and equality holds if and only if the elements of \mathcal E are mutually disjoint. For r-uniform hypergraphs \mathcal H=(\mathcal V, \mathcal E), it follows from results on Sidon sequences that \sum_{v\in \mathcal V}\lambda_{\mathcal H}(v)\leq |\mathcal V|^{r+1}+o(|\mathcal V|^{r+1}), and the bound is attained up to a constant factor by the complete r-uniform hypergraph. Next, we construct optimal edge-discriminators for some special hypergraphs, which include paths, cycles, and complete r-partite hypergraphs. Finally, we show that no optimal edge-discriminator on any hypergraph \mathcal H=(\mathcal V, \mathcal E), with |\mathcal E|=n (\geq 3), satisfies \sum_{v\in \mathcal V} \lambda_\mathcal H (v)=n(n+1)/2-1, which, in turn, raises many other interesting combinatorial questions.
