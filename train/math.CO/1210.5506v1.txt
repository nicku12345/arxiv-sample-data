A classical theorem of MacMahon states that the number of lozenge tilings of any centrally symmetric hexagon drawn on the triangular lattice is given by a beautifully simple product formula. In this paper we present a counterpart of this formula, corresponding to the {\it exterior} of a concave hexagon obtained by turning 120 degrees after drawing each side (MacMahon's hexagon is obtained by turning 60 degrees after each step).
