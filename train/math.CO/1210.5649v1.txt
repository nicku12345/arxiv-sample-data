A graph is edge-distance-regular when it is distance-regular around each of its edges and it has the same intersection numbers for any edge taken as a root. In this paper we give some (combinatorial and algebraic) proofs of the fact that every edge-distance-regular graph \G is distance-regular and homogeneous. More precisely, \G is edge-distance-regular if and only if it is bipartite distance-regular or a generalized odd graph. Also, we obtain the relationships between some of their corresponding parameters, mainly, the distance polynomials and the intersection numbers.
