We study permutations that are sorted by operators of the form \mathbf{S} \circ \alpha \circ \mathbf{S}, where \mathbf{S} is the usual stack sorting operator introduced by D. Knuth and \alpha is any D_8-symmetry obtained combining the classical reverse, complement and inverse operations. Such permutations can be characterized by excluded (generalized) patterns. Some conjectures about the enumeration of these permutations, refined with numerous classical statistics, have been proposed by A. Claesson, M. Dukes and E. Steingr\'imsson. We prove these conjectures, and enrich one of them with a few more statistics. The proofs mostly rely on generating trees techniques, and on a recent bijection of S. Giraudo between Baxter and twisted Baxter permutations.
