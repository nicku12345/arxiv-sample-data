We introduce the notion of Kravchuk derivations of the polynomial algebra. We prove that any element of the kernel of the derivation gives a polynomial identity satisfied by the Kravchuk polynomials. Also, we prove that any kernel element of the basic Weitzenb\"ok derivations yields a polynomial identity satisfied by the Kravchuk polynomials. We describe the corresponding intertwining maps.
