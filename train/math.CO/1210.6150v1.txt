The set of subspaces with a given dimension in an attenuated space has a structure of a symmetric association scheme, which is a generalization of both Grassmann schemes and bilinear forms schemes. In [K. Wang, J. Guo, F. Li, Association schemes based on attenuated space, European J. Combin. 31 (2010) 297--305], its intersection numbers were computed. In this paper, we determine its full automorphism group.
