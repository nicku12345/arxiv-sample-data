In this paper, we obtain relations in the Weyl groups of Kac-Moody algebras that come from mutation classes of skew-symmetrizable matrices. These relations generalize those obtained by Barot and Marsh for finite type. As an application, we obtain some combinatorial properties of the mutation classes of skew-symmetrizable matrices.
