For maximal planar graphs of order n\geq 4, we prove that a vertex--coloring containing no rainbow faces uses at most \lfloor\frac{2n-1}{3}\rfloor colors, and this is best possible. For maximal graph embedded on the projective plane, we obtain the analogous best bound \lfloor\frac{2n+1}{3}\rfloor. The main ingredients in the proofs are classical homological tools. By considering graphs as topological spaces, we introduce the notion of a null coloring, and prove that for any graph G a maximal null coloring f is such that the quotient graph G/f is a forest.
