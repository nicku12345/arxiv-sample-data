Let G = (V,E) be a graph, and for each e \in E(G), let L_e be a list of real numbers. Let w:E(G) \to \cup_{e \in E(G)}L_e be an edge weighting function such that w(e) \in L_e for each e \in E(G), and let c_w be the vertex colouring obtained by c_w(v) = \sum_{e \ni v}w(e). We desire the smallest possible k such that, for any choice of \{L_e \,|\, e \in E(G)\} where |L_e| \geq k for all e \in E(G), there exists an edge weighting function w for which c_w is proper. The smallest such value of k is the weight choosability number of G.   This colouring problem, introduced by Bartnicki, Grytczuk and Niwczyk (2009), is the list variation of the now famous 1-2-3 Conjecture due to Karo\'nski, {\L}uczak, and Thomason (2004). Bartnicki et al. develop a method for approaching the problem based on the Combinatorial Nullstellensatz. Though they show that some particular classes of graphs have weight choosability number at most 3, it was known whether their method could be extended to prove a bound which holds for all admissible graphs. In this paper, we show that this is indeed possible, showing that every graph is (\Delta + d + 1)-weight choosable, where \Delta is the graph's maximum degree and d is its degeneracy. In fact, more general results on total weight choosability are provided, where one assigns weights to edges and vertices. Improved bounds are also established for some classes of graph products.
