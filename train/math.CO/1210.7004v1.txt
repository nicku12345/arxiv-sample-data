Let \mathbb{F} be an infinite field with characteristic different from two. For a graph G=(V,E) with V={1,...,n}, let S(G;\mathbb{F}) be the set of all symmetric n\times n matrices A=[a_{i,j}] over \mathbb{F} with a_{i,j}\not=0, i\not=j if and only if ij\in E. We show that if G is the complement of a partial k-tree and m\geq k+2, then for all nonsingular symmetric m\times m matrices K over \mathbb{F}, there exists an m\times n matrix U such that U^T K U\in S(G;\mathbb{F}). As a corollary we obtain that, if k+2\leq m\leq n and G is the complement of a partial k-tree, then for any two nonnegative integers p and q with p+q=m, there exists a matrix in S(G;\reals) with p positive and q negative eigenvalues.
