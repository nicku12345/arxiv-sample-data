Inspired by the work of Izakhian and Rhodes, a theory of representation of hereditary collections by boolean matrices is developed. This corresponds to representation by finite \vee-generated lattices. The lattice of flats, defined for hereditary collections, lattices and matrices, plays a central role in the theory. The representations constitute a lattice and the minimal and strictly join irreducible elements are studied, as well as various closure operators.
