The Little map and the Edelman-Greene insertion algorithm, a generalization of the Robinson-Schensted correspondence, are both used for enumerating the reduced decompositions of an element of the symmetric group. We show the Little map factors through Edelman-Greene insertion and establish new results about each map as a consequence. In particular, we resolve some conjectures of Lam and Little.
