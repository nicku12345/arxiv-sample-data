We show an instance of the cyclic sieving phenomenon on annular noncrossing permutations with given cycle types. We define annular q-Kreweras numbers, annular q-Narayana numbers, and annular q-Catalan number, all of which are polynomials in q. We then show that these polynomials exhibit the cyclic sieving phenomenon on annular noncrossing permutations. We also show that a sum of annular q-Kreweras numbers becomes an annular q-Narayana number and a sum of q-Narayana numbers becomes an annular q-Catalan number.
