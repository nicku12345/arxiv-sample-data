Let \A\subset\binom{[n]}{r} be a compressed, intersecting family and let X\subset[n]. Let \A(X)={A\in\A:A\cap X\ne\emptyset} and \S_{n,r}=\binom{[n]}{r}({1}). Motivated by the Erd\H{o}s-Ko-Rado theorem, Borg asked for which X\subset[2,n] do we have |\A(X)|\le|\S_{n,r}(X)| for all compressed, intersecting families \A? We call X that satisfy this property EKR. Borg classified EKR sets X such that |X|\ge r. Barber classified X, with |X|\le r, such that X is EKR for sufficiently large n, and asked how large n must be. We prove n is sufficiently large when n grows quadratically in r. In the case where \A has a maximal element, we are able to sharpen this bound to n>\varphi^{2}r implies |\A(X)|\le|\S_{n,r}(X)|. We conclude by giving a generating function that speeds up computation of |\A(X)| in comparison with the na\"{i}ve methods.
