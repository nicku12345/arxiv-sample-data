Hamidoune's connectivity results for hierarchical Cayley digraphs are extended to Cayley coset digraphs and thus to arbitrary vertex transitive digraphs. It is shown that if a Cayley coset digraph can be hierarchically decomposed in a certain way, then it is optimally vertex connected. The results are obtained by extending the methods used by Hamidoune. They are used to show that cycle-prefix graphs are optimally vertex connected. This implies that cycle-prefix graphs have good fault tolerance properties.
