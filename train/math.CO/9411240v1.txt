An \{r,s\}-leaper is a generalized knight that can jump from (x,y) to (x\pm r,y\pm s) or (x\pm s,y\pm r) on a rectangular grid. The graph of an \{r,s\}-leaper on an m\times n board is the set of mn~vertices (x,y) for 0\leq x<m and 0\leq y<n, with an edge between vertices that are one \{r,s\}-leaper move apart. We call x the {\it rank} and y the {\it file} of board position (x,y). George~P. Jelliss raised several interesting questions about these graphs, and established some of their fundamental properties. The purpose of this paper is to characterize when the graphs are connected, for arbitrary~r and~s, and to determine the smallest boards with Hamiltonian circuits when s=r+1 or r=1.
