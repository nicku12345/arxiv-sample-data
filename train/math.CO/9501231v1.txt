Let k\ge 1 be an odd integer, t=\lfloor {{k+2}\over 4}\rfloor, and q be a prime power. We construct a bipartite, q-regular, edge-transitive graph C\!D(k,q) of order v \le 2q^{k-t+1} and girth g \ge k+5. If e is the the number of edges of C\!D(k,q), then e =\Omega(v^{1+ {1\over {k-t+1}}}). These graphs provide the best known asymptotic lower bound for the greatest number of edges in graphs of order v and girth at least g,  g\ge 5, g \not= 11,12. For g\ge 24, this represents a slight improvement on bounds established by Margulis and Lubotzky, Phillips, Sarnak; for 5\le g\le 23, g\not= 11,12, it improves on or ties existing bounds.
