Given a universe of discourse U, a {\em multiset} can be thought of as a function M from U to the natural numbers {\bf N}. In this paper, we define a {\em hybrid set} to be any function from the universe U to the integers {\bf Z}. These sets are called hybrid since they contain elements with either a positive or negative multiplicity. Our goal is to use these hybrid sets {\em as if} they were multisets in order to adequately generalize certain combinatorial facts which are true classically only for nonnegative integers.
