We characterize the Sheffer sequences by a single convolution identity  F^{(y)} p_{n}(x) = \sum _{k=0}^{n}\ p_{k}(x)\ p_{n-k}(y) where F^{(y)} is a shift-invariant operator. We then study a generalization of the notion of Sheffer sequences by removing the requirement that F^{(y)} be shift-invariant. All these solutions can then be interpreted as cocommutative coalgebras. We also show the connection with generalized translation operators as introduced by Delsarte. Finally, we apply the same convolution to symmetric functions where we find that the ``Sheffer'' sequences differ from ordinary full divided power sequences by only a constant factor.
