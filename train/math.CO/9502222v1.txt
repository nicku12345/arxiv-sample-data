A Richman game is a combinatorial game in which, rather than alternating moves, the two players bid for the privilege of making the next move. We consider both the case where the players pay each other and the case where the players pay a neutral third party. We find optimal strategies considering both the case where the players know how much money their opponent has and the case where they do not.
