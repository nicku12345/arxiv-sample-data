New proofs are given for Monjardet's theorem that all strong simple games (i.e., ipsodual elements of the free distributive lattice) can be generated by the median operation. Tighter limits are placed on the number of iterations necessary. Comparison is drawn with the \chi function which also generates all strong simple games.
