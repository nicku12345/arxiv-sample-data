Aim: Present a systematic development of part of the theory of combinatorial games from the ground up.   Approach: Computational complexity. Combinatorial games are completely determined; the questions of interest are efficiencies of strategies.   Methodology: Divide and conquer. Ascend from Nim to chess in small strides at a gradient that's not too steep.   Presentation: Informal; examples of games sampled from various strategic viewing points along scenic mountain trails, which illustrate the theory.
