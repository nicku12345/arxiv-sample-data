Let P_1, P_2,\ldots, P_{d+1} be pairwise disjoint n-element point sets in general position in d-space. It is shown that there exist a point O and suitable subsets Q_i\subseteq P_i \; (i=1, 2, \ldots, d+1) such that |Q_i|\geq c_d|P_i|, and every d-dimensional simplex with exactly one vertex in each Q_i contains O in its interior. Here c_d is a positive constant depending only on d.
