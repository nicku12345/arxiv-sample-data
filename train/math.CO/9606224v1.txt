Mills, Robbins, and Rumsey conjectured, and Zeilberger proved, that the number of alternating sign matrices of order n equals A(n):={{1!4!7! ... (3n-2)!} \over {n!(n+1)! ... (2n-1)!}}. Mills, Robbins, and Rumsey also made the stronger conjecture that the number of such matrices whose (unique) `1' of the first row is at the r^{th} column, equals A(n) {{n+r-2} \choose {n-1}}{{2n-1-r} \choose {n-1}}/ {{3n-2} \choose {n-1}}. Standing on the shoulders of A.G. Izergin, V. E. Korepin, and G. Kuperberg, and using in addition orthogonal polynomials and q-calculus, this stronger conjecture is proved.
