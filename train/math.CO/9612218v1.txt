Consider the question: Given integers k<d<n, does there exist a simple d-polytope with n faces of dimension k? We show that there exist numbers G(d,k) and N(d,k) such that for n> N(d,k) the answer is yes if and only if n\equiv 0\quad \pmod {G(d,k)}. Furthermore, a formula for G(d,k) is given, showing that e.g. G(d,k)=1 if k\ge \left\lfloor\frac{d+1}{2}\right\rfloor or if both d and k are even, and also in some other cases (meaning that all numbers beyond N(d,k) occur as the number of k-faces of some simple d-polytope).   This question has previously been studied only for the case of vertices (k=0), where Lee \cite{Le} proved the existence of N(d,0) (with G(d,0)=1 or 2 depending on whether d is even or odd), and Prabhu \cite{P2} showed that N(d,0) \le cd\sqrt {d}. We show here that asymptotically the true value of Prabhu's constant is c=\sqrt2 if d is even, and c=1 if d is odd.
