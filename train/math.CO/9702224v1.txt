The Shi arrangement {\mathcal S}_n is the arrangement of affine hyperplanes in {\mathbb R}^n of the form x_i - x_j = 0 or 1, for 1 \leq i < j \leq n. It dissects {\mathbb R}^n into (n+1)^{n-1} regions, as was first proved by Shi. We give a simple bijective proof of this result. Our bijection generalizes easily to any subarrangement of {\mathcal S}_n containing the hyperplanes x_i - x_j = 0 and to the extended Shi arrangements.
