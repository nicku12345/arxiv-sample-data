It has been shown that there is a Hamilton cycle in every connected Cayley graph on each group G whose commutator subgroup is cyclic of prime-power order. This paper considers connected, vertex-transitive graphs X of order at least 3 where the automorphism group of X contains a transitive subgroup G whose commutator subgroup is cyclic of prime-power order. We show that of these graphs, only the Petersen graph is not hamiltonian.
