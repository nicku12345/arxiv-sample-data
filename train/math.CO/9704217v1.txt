There are two related poset structures, the higher Stasheff-Tamari orders, on the set of all triangulations of the cyclic d polytope with n vertices. In this paper it is shown that both of them have the homotopy type of a sphere of dimension n-d-3.   Moreover, we resolve positively a new special case of the \emph{Generalized Baues Problem}: The Baues poset of all polytopal decompositions of a cyclic polytope of dimension d \leq 3 has the homotopy type of a sphere of dimension n-d-2.
