We consider a finite set E of points in the n-dimensional affine space and two sets of objects that are generated by the set E: the system \Sigma of n-dimensional simplices with vertices in E and the system \Gamma of chambers. The incidence matrix A= \parallel a_{\sigma, \gamma}\parallel, \sigma \in \Sigma, \gamma \in \Gamma, induces the notion of linear independence among simplices (and among chambers). We present an algorithm of construction of bases of simplices (and bases of chambers). For the case n=2 such an algorithm was described in the author's paper {\em Combinatorial bases in systems of simplices and chambers} (Discrete Mathematics 157 (1996) 15--37). However, the case of n-dimensional space required a different technique. It is also proved that the constructed bases of simplices are geometrical.
