Major Percy A. MacMahon's first paper on plane partitions included a conjectured generating function for symmetric plane partitions. This conjecture was proven almost simultaneously by George Andrews and Ian Macdonald, Andrews using the machinery of basic hypergeometric series and Macdonald employing his knowledge of symmetric functions. The purpose of this paper is to simplify Macdonald's proof by providing a direct, inductive proof of his formula which expresses the sum of Schur functions whose partitions fit inside a rectangular box as a ratio of determinants.
