Propp conjectured that the number of lozenge tilings of a semiregular hexagon of sides 2n-1, 2n-1 and 2n which contain the central unit rhombus is precisely one third of the total number of lozenge tilings. Motivated by this, we consider the more general situation of a semiregular hexagon of sides a, a and b. We prove explicit formulas for the number of lozenge tilings of these hexagons containing the central unit rhombus, and obtain Propp's conjecture as a corollary of our results.
