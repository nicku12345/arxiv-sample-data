We compute the spectra of the adjacency matrices of the semi-regular polytopes. A few different techniques are employed: the most sophisticated, which relates the 1-skeleton of the polytope to a Cayley graph, is based on methods akin to those of Lov\'asz and Babai ([L], [B]). It turns out that the algebraic degree of the eigenvalues is at most 5, achieved at two 3-dimensional solids.
