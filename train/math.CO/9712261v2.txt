We compute the number of rhombus tilings of a hexagon with sides a+2,b+2,c+2,a+2,b+2,c+2 with three fixed tiles touching the border. The particular case a=b=c solves a problem posed by Propp. Our result can also be viewed as the enumeration of plane partitions having a+2 rows and b+2 columns, with largest entry \le c+2, with a given number of entries c+2 in the first row, a given number of entries 0 in the last column and a given bottom-left entry.
