We find the Martin boundary for the Young-Fibonacci lattice YF. Along with the lattice of Young diagrams, this is the most interesting example of a differential poset. The Martin boundary construction provides an explicit Poisson-type integral representation of non-negative harmonic functions on YF. The latter are in a canonical correspondence with a set of traces on Okada locally semisimple algebra. The set is known to contain all the indecomposable traces. Presumably, all of the traces in the set are indecomposable, though we have no proof of this conjecture. Using a new explicit product formula for Okada characters, we derive precise regularity conditions under which a sequence of characters of finite-dimensional Okada algebras converges to a character of the infinite-dimensional one.
