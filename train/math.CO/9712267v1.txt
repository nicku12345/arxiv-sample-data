We study the Young graph with edge multiplicities arising in a Pieri-type formula for Jack symmetric polynomials P_\mu(x;a) with a parameter a. Starting with the empty diagram, we define recurrently the `dimensions' \dim_a in the same way as for the Young lattice or Pascal triangle.   New proofs are given for two known results. The first is the a-hook formula for \dim_a, first found by R.Stanley. Secondly, we prove (for all complex u and v) a generalization of the identity \sum\nu(c(b)+u)(c(b)+v)\dim\nu/\dim\mu=(n+1)(n+uv), where \nu runs over immediate successors of a Young diagram \mu with n boxes. Here c(b) is the content of a new box b. The identity is known to imply the existence of an interesting family of positive definite central functions on the infinite symmetric group.   The approach is based on the interpretation of a Young diagram as a pair of interlacing sequences, so that analytic techniques may be used to solve combinatorial problems. We show that when dealing with Jack polynomials P_\mu(x;a), it makes sense to consider `anisotropic' Young diagrams made of rectangular boxes of size 1\times a.
