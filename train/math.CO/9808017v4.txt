The number of plane partitions contained in a given box was shown by MacMahon to be given by a simple product formula. By a simple bijection, this formula also enumerates lozenge tilings of hexagons of side-lengths a,b,c,a,b,c (in cyclic order) and angles of 120 degrees. We present a generalization in the case b=c by giving simple product formulas enumerating lozenge tilings of regions obtained from a hexagon of side-lengths a,b+k,b,a+k,b,b+k (where k is an arbitrary non-negative integer) and angles of 120 degrees by removing certain triangular regions along its symmetry axis.
