We define the family of {\it locally path-bounded} digraphs, which is a class of infinite digraphs, and show that on this class it is relatively easy to compute an optimal strategy (winning or nonlosing); and realize a win, when possible, in a finite number of moves. This is done by proving that the Generalized Sprague-Grundy function exists uniquely and has finite values on this class.
