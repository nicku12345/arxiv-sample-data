A move in the game of nim consists of taking any positive number of tokens from a single pile. Suppose we add the class of moves of taking a nonnegative number of tokens jointly from all the piles. We give a complete answer to the question which moves in the class can be adjoined without changing the winning strategy of nim. The results apply to other combinatorial games with unbounded Sprague-Grundy function values. We formulate two weakened conditions of the notion of nim-sum 0 for proving the results.
