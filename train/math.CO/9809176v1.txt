A proof is sketched of the Polynomial Conjecture of the author (circulated as preprint "Brick Tiling and Monotone Boolean Functions", available at the http://www.math.ufl.edu/~squash/tilingstuff.html url) which says that the family of minimal tilable-boxes grows polynomially with dimension. An important ingredient of the argument is translating the problem from its finite-dimensional geometric framework to the algebraic setting of an infinite-dimensional lattice.
