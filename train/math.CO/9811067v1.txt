We examine the poset P of 132-avoiding n-permutations ordered by descents. We show that this poset is the "coarsening" of the well-studied poset Q of noncrossing partitions . In other words, if x<y in Q, then f(y)<f(x) in P, where f is the canonical bijection from the set of noncrossing partitions onto that of 132-avoiding permutations. This enables us to prove many properties of P.
