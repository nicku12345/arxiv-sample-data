Neighborly cubical polytopes exist: for any n\ge d\ge 2r+2, there is a cubical convex d-polytope C^n_d whose r-skeleton is combinatorially equivalent to that of the n-dimensional cube. This solves a problem of Babson, Billera & Chan.   Kalai conjectured that the boundary \partial C^n_d of a neighborly cubical polytope C^n_d maximizes the f-vector among all cubical (d-1)-spheres with 2^n vertices. While we show that this is true for polytopal spheres for n\le d+1, we also give a counter-example for d=4 and n=6.   Further, the existence of neighborly cubical polytopes shows that the graph of the n-dimensional cube, where n\ge5, is ``dimensionally ambiguous'' in the sense of Gr\"unbaum. We also show that the graph of the 5-cube is ``strongly 4-ambiguous''.   In the special case d=4, neighborly cubical polytopes have f_3=f_0/4 \log_2 f_0/4 vertices, so the facet-vertex ratio f_3/f_0 is not bounded; this solves a problem of Kalai, Perles and Stanley studied by Jockusch.
