In an investigation of the applications of Combinatorial Game Theory to chess, we construct novel mutual Zugzwang positions, explain an otherwise mysterious pawn endgame from "A Guide to Chess Endings" (Euwe and Hooper), show positions containing non-integer values (fractions, switches, tinies, and loopy games), and pose open problems concerning the values that may be realized by positions on either standard or nonstandard chessboards.
