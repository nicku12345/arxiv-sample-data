The concept of an H-cordial graph is introduced by I. Cahit in 1996 (Bulletin of the ICA). But that paper has some gaps and invalid statements. We try to prove the statements whose proofs in Cahit's paper have problems, and also we give counterexamples for the wrong statements. We prove necessary and sufficient conditions for H-cordiality of complete graphs and wheels and H_2-cordiality of wheels, which are wrongly claimed in Cahit's paper.
