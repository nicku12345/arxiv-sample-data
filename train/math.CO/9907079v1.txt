Let Y denote a symmetric association scheme which is Q-polynomial with respect to an ordering E_0,...,E_D of the primitive idempotents. Bannai and Ito conjectured that the associated sequence of multiplicities m_0,...,m_D is unimodal. We prove that if Y is dual-thin in the sense of Terwilliger, then the sequence of multiplicities satisfies m_i <= m_{i+1} and m_i <= m_{D-i} for i < D/2.
