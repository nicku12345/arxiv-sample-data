In this paper we determine partial answers to the question given in the title, thereby significantly extending results of Broere and Hattingh. We characterize completely those pairs of complete graphs whose tensor products are circulant. We establish that if the orders of these circulant graphs have greatest common divisor of 2, the product is circulant whenever both graphs are bipartite. We also establish that it is possible for one of the two graphs not to be circulant and the product still to be circulant.
