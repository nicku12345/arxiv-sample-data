Let f_n^r(k) be the number of 132-avoiding permutations on n letters that contain exactly r occurrences of 12... k, and let F_r(x;k) and F(x,y;k) be the generating functions defined by F_r(x;k)=\sum_{n\gs0} f_n^r(k)x^n and F(x,y;k)=\sum_{r\gs0}F_r(x;k)y^r. We find an explcit expression for F(x,y;k) in the form of a continued fraction. This allows us to express F_r(x;k) for 1\ls r\ls k via Chebyshev polynomials of the second kind.
