Exact sequences are a well known notion in homological algebra. We investigate here the more vague properties of 'homotopical exactness', appearing for instance in the fibre or cofibre sequence of a map.   Such notions of exactness can be given for very general 'categories with homotopies' having homotopy kernels and cokernels, but become more interesting under suitable stability hypotheses, satisfied - in particular - by chain complexes. It is then possible to measure the default of homotopical exactness of a sequence by the homotopy type of a certain object, a sort of 'homotopical homology'.
