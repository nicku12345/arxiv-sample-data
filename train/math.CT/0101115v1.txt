We propose the categorification of the algebraic analysis as the Leibniz 3-category given by generators and relations, including the Leibniz 3-cell relation. The Leibniz category offers the `most general' `(co-)derivation' 3-cell. We outline a program in which every 2-cell related to (or a type of) a Leibniz partial (co-)derivation 3-cell, is translated into an appropriate 2-cell related to the Cartan 3-cell, and vice versa. A model of a non-Leibniz 2-cell responsible for the stochastic calculus must be a ternary operation.
