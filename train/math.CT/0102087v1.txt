If a Quillen model category can be specified using a certain logical syntax (intuitively, ``is algebraic/combinatorial enough''), so that it can be defined in any category of sheaves, then the satisfaction of Quillen's axioms over any site is a purely formal consequence of their being satisfied over the category of sets. Such data give rise to a functor from the category of topoi and geometric morphisms to Quillen model categories and Quillen adjunctions.
