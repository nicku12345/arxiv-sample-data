The theory of parity quasi-complexes (PQC) is developed, preparing a set up for defining derived functors using resolutions in the nonabelian case.   A homotopy structure on the category of PQC is defined, yielding a 2-category structure. The nonabelian homology functor factors through the corresponding homotopy category.   Following the relative homological algebra approach, resolutions are defined as PQC having parity contracting homotopies in a suitable category.   A canonical non-abelian PQC resolution for groups is defined.
