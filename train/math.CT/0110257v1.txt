We show that certain tensor product multiplicities in semisimple braided sovereign tensor categories must be even. The quantity governing this behavior is the Frobenius-Schur indicator. The result applies in particular to the representation categories of large classes of groups, Lie algebras, Hopf algebras and vertex algebras.
