Let L_n denote the Dwyer-Kan localization of the category of weak n-categories divided by the n-equivalences. We propose a list of properties that this simplicial category is likely to have, and conjecture that these properties characterize L_n up to equivalence. We show, using these properties, how to obtain the morphism n-1-categories between two points in an object of L_n and how to obtain the composition map between the morphism objects.
