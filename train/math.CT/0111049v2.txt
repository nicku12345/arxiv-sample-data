To any triangulated category with tensor product (K,\otimes), we associate a topological space Spc(K,\otimes), by means of thick subcategories of K, a la Hopkins-Neeman-Thomason. Moreover, to each open subset U of Spc(K,\otimes), we associate a triangulated category K(U), producing what could be thought of as a presheaf of triangulated categories. Applying this to the derived category (K,\otimes):=(D^{perf}(X),\otimes^L) of perfect complexes on a noetherian scheme X, the topological space Spc(K,\otimes) turns out to be the underlying topological space of X; moreover, for each open U\subset X, the category K(U) is naturally equivalent to D^{perf}(U).   As an application, we give a method to reconstruct any reduced noetherian scheme X from its derived category of perfect complexes D^{perf}(X), considering the latter as a tensor triangulated category with \otimes^L.
