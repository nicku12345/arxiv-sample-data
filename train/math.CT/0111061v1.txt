The postulates of comprehension and extensionality in set theory are based on an inversion principle connecting set-theoretic abstraction and the property of having a member. An exactly analogous inversion principle connects functional abstraction and application to an argument in the postulates of the lambda calculus. Such an inversion principle arises also in two adjoint situations involving a cartesian closed category and its polynomial extension. Composing these two adjunctions, which stem from the deduction theorem of logic, produces the adjunction connecting product and exponentiation, i.e. conjunction and implication.
