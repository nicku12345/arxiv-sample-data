We develop abstract nonsense for module categories over monoidal categories (this is a straightforward categorification of modules over rings). As applications we show that any semisimple monoidal category with finitely many simple objects is equivalent to the category of representations of a weak Hopf algebra (theorem of T. Hayashi) and classify module categories over the fusion category of \hat{sl}(2) at a positive integer level where we meet once again ADE classification pattern.
