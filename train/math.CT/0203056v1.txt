We give a functorial definition of G-gerbes over a simplicial complex when the local symmetry group G is non-Abelian. These combinatorial gerbes are naturally endowed with a connective structure and a curving. This allows us to define a fibered category equipped with a functorial connection over the space of edge-paths. By computing the curvature of the latter on the faces of an infinitesimal 4-simplex, we recover the cocycle identities satisfied by the curvature of this gerbe. The link with BF-theories suggests that gerbes provide a framework adapted to the geometric formulation of strongly coupled gauge theories.
