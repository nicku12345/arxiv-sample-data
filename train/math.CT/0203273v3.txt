For K a field, a Wedderburn K-linear category is a K-linear category \sA whose radical \sR is locally nilpotent and such that \bar \sA:=\sA/\sR is semi-simple and remains so after any extension of scalars. We prove existence and uniqueness results for sections of the projection \sA\to \bar\sA, in the vein of the theorems of Wedderburn. There are two such results: one in the general case and one when \sA has a monoidal structure for which \sR is a monoidal ideal. The latter applies notably to Tannakian categories over a field of characteristic zero, and we get a generalisation of the Jacobson-Morozov theorem: the existence of a pro-reductive envelope \Pred(G) associated to any affine group scheme G over K. Other applications are given in this paper as well as in a forthcoming one on motives.
