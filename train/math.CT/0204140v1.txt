In several familiar subcategories of the category {\mathbb T} of topological spaces and continuous maps, embeddings are not pushout-stable. But, an interesting feature, capturable in many categories, namely in categories \mathcal{B} of topological spaces, is the following: For \mathcal{M} the class of all embeddings, the subclass of all pushout-stable \mathcal{M}-morphisms (that is, of those \mathcal{M}-morphisms whose pushout along an arbitrary morphism always belongs to \mathcal{M}) is of the form A^{Inj} for some space A, where A^{Inj} consists of all morphisms m:X \to Y such that the map Hom(m,A): Hom(Y,A) \to Hom(X,A) is surjective. We study this phenomenon. We show that, under mild assumptions, the reflective hull of such a space A is the smallest \mathcal{M}-reflective subcategory of \mathcal{B}; furthermore, the opposite category of this reflective hull is equivalent to a reflective subcategory of the Eilenberg-Moore category Set^{\mathbb T}, where {\mathbb T} is the monad induced by the right adjoint Hom(-,A): {\mathbb T}^{op} \to Set. We also find conditions on a category \mathcal{B} under which the pushout-stable \mathcal{M}-morphisms are of the form \mathcal{A}^{Inj} for some category \mathcal{A}.
