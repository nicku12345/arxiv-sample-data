We give a sufficient condition for an Ext-finite triangulated category to be saturated. Saturatedness means that every contravariant cohomological functor of finite type to vector spaces is representable. The condition consists in existence of a strong generator. We prove that the bounded derived categories of coherent sheaves on smooth proper commutative and noncommutative varieties have strong generators, hence saturated. In contrast the similar category for a smooth compact analytic surface with no curves is not saturated.
