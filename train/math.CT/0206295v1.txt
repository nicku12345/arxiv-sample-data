We show how derived categories build bridges across the current mathematical mainstream, linking geometric and algebraic, commutative and noncommutative, local and global banks. Arches in these bridges are pieces of semiorthogonal decompositions of triangulated categories. To appear in the Proceedings of the ICM 2002 in Beijing.
