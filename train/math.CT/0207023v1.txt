We consider categories of generalized perverse sheaves, with relaxed constructibility conditions, by means of the process of gluing t-structures and we exhibit explicit abelian categories defined in terms of standard sheaves categories which are equivalent to the former ones. In particular, we are able to realize perverse sheaves categories as non full abelian subcategories of the usual bounded complexes of sheaves categories. Our methods use induction on perversities. In this paper, we restrict ourselves to the two-strata case, but our results extend to the general case.
