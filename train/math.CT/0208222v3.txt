We elaborate on the representation theorems of topoi as topoi of discrete actions of various kinds of localic groups and groupoids. We introduce the concept of "proessential point" and use it to give a new characterization of pointed Galois topoi. We establish a hierarchy of connected topoi:   [1. essentially pointed Atomic = locally simply connected],   [2. proessentially pointed Atomic = pointed Galois],   [3. pointed Atomic].   These topoi are the classifying topos of, respectively: 1. discrete groups, 2. prodiscrete localic groups, and 3. general localic groups.   We analyze also the unpoited version, and show that for a Galois topos, may be pointless, the corresponding groupoid can also be considered, in a sense, the groupoid of "points". In the unpointed theories, these topoi classify, respectively: 1. connected discrete groupoids, 2. connected (may be pointless) prodiscrete localic groupoids, and 3. connected groupoids with discrete space of objects and general localic spaces of hom-sets, when the topos has points (we do not know the class of localic groupoids that correspond to pointless connected atomic topoi).   We comment and develop on Grothendieck's galois theory and its generalization by Joyal-Tierney, and work by other authors on these theories.
