A topological group G is {\em sequentially h-complete} if all the continuous homomorphic images of G are sequentially complete. In this paper we give necessary and sufficient conditions on a complete group for being compact, using the language of sequential h-completeness. In the process of obtaining such conditions, we establish a structure theorem for \omega-precompact sequentially h-complete groups. As a consequence we obtain a reduction theorem for the problem of c-compactness.
