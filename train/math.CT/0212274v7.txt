We outline the main features of the definitions and applications of crossed complexes and cubical \omega-groupoids with connections. These give forms of higher homotopy groupoids, and new views of basic algebraic topology and the cohomology of groups, with the ability to obtain some non commutative results and compute some homotopy types.
