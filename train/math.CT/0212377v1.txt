In many everyday categories (sets, spaces, modules, ...) objects can be both added and multiplied. The arithmetic of such objects is a challenge because there is usually no subtraction. We prove a family of cases of the following principle: if an arithmetic statement about the objects can be proved by pretending that they are complex numbers, then there also exists an honest proof.
