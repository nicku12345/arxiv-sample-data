We construct the crossed product of a C(X)-algebra by an endomorphism, in such a way that the endomorphism itself becomes induced by the bimodule of continuous sections of a vector bundle. Some motivating examples for such a construction are given. Furthermore, we study the C*-algebra of G-invariant elements of the Cuntz-Pimsner algebra associated with a G-vector bundle, where G is a (noncompact, in general) group. In particular, the C*-algebra of invariant elements w.r.t. the action of the group of special unitaries of the given vector bundle is a crossed product in the above sense. We also study the analogous construction on certain Hilbert bimodules, called 'noncommutative pullbacks'.
