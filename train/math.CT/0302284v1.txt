One proves that the category of globular CW-complexes up to dihomotopy is equivalent to the category of flows up to weak dihomotopy. This theorem generalizes the classical theorem which states that the category of CW-complexes up to homotopy is equivalent to the category of topological spaces up to weak homotopy. This note is the second one presenting some of the results of math.AT/0201252.
