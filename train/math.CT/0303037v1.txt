We show that the projectivization of the exceptional rank 2 vector bundle on an arbitrary smooth V14 Fano threefold after a certain natural flop turns into the projectivization of an instanton vector bundle on a smooth cubic threefold. And vice versa, starting from a smooth cubic threefold with an instanton vector bundle of charge 2 on it we reconstruct V14 threefold.   Relying on the geometric properties of the above correspondence we prove that the orthogonals to the exceptional pairs in the bounded derived categories of coherent sheaves on a smooth V14 threefold and on the corresponding cubic threefold are equivalent as triangulated categories.
