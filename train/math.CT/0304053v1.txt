The centre of a monoidal category is a braided monoidal category. Monoidal categories are monoidal objects (or pseudomonoids) in the monoidal bicategory of categories. This paper provides a universal construction in a braided monoidal bicategory that produces a braided monoidal object from any monoidal object. Some properties and sufficient conditions for existence of the construction are examined.
