We generalise the concepts introduced by Baez and Dolan to define opetopes constructed from symmetric operads with a category, rather than a set, of objects. We describe the category of 1-level generalised multicategories, a special case of the concept introduced by Hermida, Makkai and Power, and exhibit a full embedding of this category in the category of symmetric operads with a category of objects. As an analogy to the Baez-Dolan slice construction, we exhibit a certain multicategory of function replacement as a slice construction in the multitopic setting, and use it to construct multitopes. We give an explicit description of the relationship between opetopes and multitopes.
