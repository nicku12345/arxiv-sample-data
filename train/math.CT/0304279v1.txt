We define the category of tidy symmetric multicategories. We construct for each tidy symmetric multicategory Q a cartesian monad (E_Q,T_Q) and extend this assignation to a functor. We exhibit a relationship between the slice construction on symmetric multicategories, and the `free operad' monad construction on suitable monads. We use this to give an explicit description of the relationship between Baez-Dolan and Leinster opetopes.
