Consider a cofibrantly generated model category S, a small category C and a subcategory D of C. We endow the category S^C of functors from C to S with a model structure, defining weak equivalences and fibrations objectwise but only on D. Our first concern is the effect of moving C, D and S. The main notion introduced here is the ``D-codescent'' property for objects in S^C. Our long-term program aims at reformulating as codescent statements the Conjectures of Baum-Connes and Farrell-Jones, and at tackling them with new methods. Here, we set the grounds of a systematic theory of codescent, including pull-backs, push-forwards and various invariance properties.
