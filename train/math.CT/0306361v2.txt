Considering quantales as generalised noncommutative spaces, we address as an example a quantale Pen based on the Penrose tilings of the plane. We study in general the representations of involutive quantales on those of binary relations, and show that in the case of Pen the algebraically irreducible representations provide a complete classification of the set of Penrose tilings from which its representation as a quotient of Cantor space is recovered.
