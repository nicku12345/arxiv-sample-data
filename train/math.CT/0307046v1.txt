Recently, a principle for state confinement has been proposed in a category theoretic framework and to accomodate this result the notion of a pre-monoidal category was developed. Here we describe an algebraic approach for the construction of such categories. We introduce a procedure called twining which breaks the quasi-bialgebra structure of the universal enveloping algebras of semi-simple Lie algebras and renders the category of finite-dimensional modules pre-monoidal. The category is also symmetric, meaning that each object of the category provides representations of the symmetric groups, which allows for a generalised boson-fermion statistic to be defined. Exclusion and confinement principles for systems of indistinguishable particles are formulated as an invariance with respect to the symmetric group actions. We apply the construction to several examples and in particular show that the symmetries which can be associated to colour, spin and flavour degrees of freedom of quarks do lead naturally to confinement of states.
