In this paper we take up again the deformation theory for K-linear pseudofunctors initiated in a previous work (Adv. Math. 182 (2004) 204-277). We start by introducing a notion of a 2-cosemisimplicial object in an arbitrary 2-category and analyzing the corresponding coherence question, where the permutohedra make their appearence. We then describe a general method to obtain cochain complexes of K-modules from (enhanced) 2-cosemisimplicial objects in the 2-category {\bf Cat}_K of small K-linear categories and prove that the deformation complex introduced in the above mentioned work can be obtained by this method from a 2-cosemisimplicial object that can be associated to the pseudofunctor. Finally, using a generalization to the context of K-linear categories of the deviation calculus introduced by Markl and Stasheff for K-modules (J. Algebra 170 (1994) 122), it is shown that the obstructions to the integrability of an n^{th}-order deformation of a pseudofunctor indeed correspond to cocycles in the third cohomology group, a question which remained open in our previous work.
