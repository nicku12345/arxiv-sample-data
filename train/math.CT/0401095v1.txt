We establish the following model-theoretic characterization: profinite L-structures, the cofiltered limits of finite L-structures,are retracts of ultraproducts of finite L-structures. As a consequence, any elementary class of L-structures axiomatized by L-sentences of the form \forall \vec{x} (\psi_{0}(\vec{x}) \ra \psi_{1}(\vec{x})), where \psi_{0}(\vec{x}),\psi_{1}(\vec{x}) are existencial-positives L-formulas, is closed under the formation of profinite objects in the category {\bf L-mod}, the category of structures suitable for the language L and L-homomorphisms.
