Just as point objects are parallel transported along curves, giving holonomies, string-like objects are parallel transported along surfaces, giving surface holonomies. Composition of these surfaces correspond to products in a category theoretic generalization of the gauge group, called a 2-group. I consider two different ways of constructing surface holonomies, one by using a pair of one and two form connections, and another by using a pair of one-form connections. Both procedures result in the structure of a 2-group.
