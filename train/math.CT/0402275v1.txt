We develop a completion theory for (general) non-Archimedean spaces based on the theory on "a categorical concept of completion of objects" as introduced by G.C.L. Br\"ummer and E. Giuli. Our context is the construct \mathbf{NA}_0 of all Hausdorff non-Archimedean spaces and uniformly continuous maps and \mathcal{V} is the class of all epimorphic embeddings in \mathbf{NA}_0.   We determine the class {\bf Inj} \mathcal{V} of all \mathcal{V}-injective objects and we present an internal characterization as "complete objects". The basic tool for this characterization is a notion of small collections that in some sense preserve the inclusion order on the non-Archimedean structure. We prove that the full subconstruct \mathbf{CNA}_0 consisting of all complete objects forms a firmly \mathcal{V}-reflective subcategory. This means that every object X in \mathbf{NA}_0 has a completion which is a \mathcal{V}-reflection r_X:X\to RX into the full subconstruct \mathbf{CNA}_0 of "complete spaces". Moreover this completion is unique (up to isomorphism) in the sense that, considering L(\mathbf{CNA}_0), the class of all those morphisms u: X\to Y for which Ru:RX\to RY is an isomorphism, one has that \mathcal{V} is contained in L(\mathbf{CNA}_0). In fact one even has \mathcal{V}=L(\mathbf{CNA}_0).   Finally we apply our constructions to the classical case of Hausdorff non-Archimedean uniform spaces, in that case our completion reduces to the standard one.
