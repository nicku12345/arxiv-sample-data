We use simple currents to construct symmetric special Frobenius algebras in modular tensor categories. We classify such simple current type algebras with the help of abelian group cohomology. We show that they lead to the modular invariant torus partition functions that have been studied by Kreuzer and Schellekens. We also classify boundary conditions in the associated conformal field theories and show that the boundary states are given by the formula proposed in hep-th/0007174. Finally, we investigate conformal defects in these theories.
