Prof. Boris I. Plotkin [arXiv:math.GM/0210194, arXiv:math.GM/0204245] drew attention to the question when an equivalence between two categories is isomorphic as a functor to an isomorphism between them. It turns out that it is quite important for universal algebraical geometry and concerns mainly the categories \Theta \sp 0 (X)  of free universal algebras of some variety \Theta  free generated by finite subsets of X. In the paper, a complete answer to the Plotkin's question is given: there are no proper autoequivalences of the category \Theta \sp 0 (X) . Also some connected problems are discussed.
