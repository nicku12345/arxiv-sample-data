Neocategories, semicategories, precategories are well-known generalizations of categories. But they all suppose that sources and targets of morphisms fulfilled identity conditions. Here we intend to suppress those conditions. In doing this we get at the construction of a simple framework which seems appropiate to study Moore surfaces and their possible extensions in higher dimensions.
