Let (X,x) be a germ of real or complex analytic space and \mathcal{A}_{(X,x)} the space of germs of arcs on (X,x). Let us consider F_{x}: (X,x) \to (Y,y) a germ of a morphism and denote by \mathcal{F}_{x}: \mathcal{A}_{(X,x)} \to \mathcal{A}_{(Y,y)} the induced morphism at the level of arcs. In this paper, we try to emphasize the analogies between the metric or local topological properties of F_{x} and those of \mathcal{F}_{x}. We then define the notions of Nash sequence of multiplicities, Nash sequence of Hilbert-Samuel functions and Nash sequence of diagram of initial exponents of X along an arc \phi, and study some of their basic properties. Some elementary connections between these notions and motivic integration theory are also provided.
