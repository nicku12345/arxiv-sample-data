We give an abstract criterion for pasting pseudofunctors on two subcategories of a category into a pseudofunctor on the whole category. As an application we extend the variance theory of the twisted inverse image (-)^! over schemes to that over formal schemes. Thus we show that over composites of compactifiable maps of noetherian formal schemes, there is a pseudofunctor (-)^! such that if f is a pseudoproper map, then f^! is the right adjoint to the derived direct image \R f_* and if f is etale, then f^! is the inverse image f^*. We also show that (-)^! is compatible with flat base change.
