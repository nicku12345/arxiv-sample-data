In the model of synthetic differential geometry consisting of sheaves (with respect to open covers) over the opposite category of the category of closed finitely generated C-infinity rings, any morphism from S, the zeroes of the "amazing right adjoint" of dx, to the real line R extends to a morphism from R to R. This shows that the De Rham cohomology of the space S is the same as the characteristic cohomology of the ideal generated by dx.
