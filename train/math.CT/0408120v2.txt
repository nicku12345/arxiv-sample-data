In this paper, the 2-category \mathfrak{Rep}_{{\bf 2Mat}_{\mathbb{C}}}(\mathbb{G}) of (weak) representations of an arbitrary (weak) 2-group \mathbb{G} on (some version of) Kapranov and Voevodsky's 2-category of (complex) 2-vector spaces is studied. In particular, the set of equivalence classes of representations is computed in terms of the invariants \pi_0(\mathbb{G}), \pi_1(\mathbb{G}) and [\alpha]\in H^3(\pi_0(\mathbb{G}),\pi_1(\mathbb{G})) classifying \mathbb{G}. Also the categories of morphisms (up to equivalence) and the composition functors are determined explicitly. As a consequence, we obtain the the {\it monoidal} category of linear representations (more generally, the category of [z]-projective representations, for any given cohomology class [z]\in H^2(\pi_0(\mathbb{G}),\mathbb{C}^*)) of the first homotopy group \pi_0(\mathbb{G}) as well as its category of representations on finite sets both live in \mathfrak{Rep}_{{\bf 2Mat}_{\mathbb{C}}}(\mathbb{G}), the first as the monoidal category of endomorphisms of the trivial representation (more generally, as the category of morphisms between suitable 1-dimensional representations) and the second as a subcategory of the homotopy category of \mathfrak{Rep}_{{\bf 2Mat}_{\mathbb{C}}}(\mathbb{G}).
