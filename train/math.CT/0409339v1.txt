We determine the Postnikov Tower and Postnikov Invariants of a Crossed Complex in a purely algebraic way. Using the fact that Crossed Complexes are homotopy types for filtered spaces, we use the above "algebraically defined" Postnikov Tower and Postnikov Invariants to obtain from them those of filtered spaces. We argue that a similar "purely algebraic" approach to Postnikov Invariants may also be used in other categories of spaces.
