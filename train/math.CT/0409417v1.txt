Let \Lambda be a commutative local uniserial ring of length at least seven with radical factor ring k. We consider the category S(\Lambda) of all possible embeddings of submodules of finitely generated \Lambda-modules and show that S(\Lambda) is controlled k-wild with a single control object I\in S(\Lambda). In particular, it follows that each finite dimensional k-algebra can be realized as a quotient \End(X)/\End(X)_I of the endomorphism ring of some object X\in S(\Lambda) modulo the ideal \End(X)_I of all maps which factor through a finite direct sum of copies of I.
