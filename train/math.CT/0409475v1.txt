We study presheaves on semicategories enriched in a quantaloid: this gives rise to the notion of regular presheaf. A semicategory is regular when its representable presheaves are regular, and its regular presheaves then constitute an essential (co)localization of the category of all of its presheaves. The notion of regular semidistributor allows to establish the Morita equivalence of regular semicategories. Continuous orders and Omega-sets provide examples.
