A general notion of operad is given, which includes as instances, the operads originally conceived to study loop spaces, as well as the higher operads that arise in the globular approach to higher dimensional algebra. In the framework of this paper, one can also describe symmetric and braided analogues of higher operads, likely to be important to the study of weakly symmetric, higher dimensional monoidal structures.
