The theory of rack and quandle modules is developed - in particular a tensor product is defined, and shown to satisfy an appropriate adjointness condition. Notions of free rack and quandle modules are introduced, and used to define an enveloping object (the `rack algebra' or `wring') for a given rack or quandle. These constructions are then used to define homology and cohomology theories for racks and quandles which contain all currently-known variants.
