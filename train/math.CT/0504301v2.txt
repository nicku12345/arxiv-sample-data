Let \Lambda be an artin algebra and S(\Lambda) the category of all embeddings (A\subseteq B) where B is a finitely generated \Lambda-module and A is a submodule of B. Then S(\Lambda) is an exact Krull-Schmidt category which has Auslander-Reiten sequences. In this manuscript we show that the Auslander-Reiten translation in S(\Lambda) can be computed within the category of \Lambda-modules by using our construction of minimal monomorphisms. If in addition \Lambda is uniserial then any nonprojective indecomposable object in \Cal S(\Lambda) is invariant under the sixth power of the Auslander-Reiten translation.
