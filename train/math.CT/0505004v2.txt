Given a ring homomorphism B \to A, consider its centralizer R = A^B, bimodule endomorphism ring S = \End {}_BA_B and sub-tensor-square ring T = (A \o_B A)^B. Nonassociative tensoring by the cyclic modules R_T or {}_SR leads to an equivalence of categories inverse to the functors of induction of restricted A-modules or restricted coinduction of B-modules in case A \| B is separable, H-separable, split or left depth two (D2). If R_T or {}_SR are projective, this property characterizes separability or splitness for a ring extension. Only in the case of H-separability is R_T a progenerator, which replaces the key module A_{A^e} for an Azumaya algebra A. After establishing these characterizations, we characterize left D2 extensions in terms of the module T_R, and ask whether a weak generator condition on R_T might characterize left D2 extensions as well, possibly a problem in \sigma(M)-categories or its generalizations.   We also show that the centralizer of a depth two extension is a normal subring in the sense of Rieffel as well as pre-braided commutative. For example, its normality yields a Hopf subalgebra analogue of a factoid for subgroups and their centralizers, and a special case of a conjecture that D2 Hopf subalgebras are normal.
