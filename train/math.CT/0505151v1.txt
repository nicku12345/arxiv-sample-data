In algebraic geometry over a variety of universal algebras \Theta , the group Aut(\Theta ^{0}) of automorphisms of the category \Theta ^{0} of finitely generated free algebras of \Theta  is of great importance. In this paper, semi-inner automorphisms are defined for the categories of free (semi)modules and free Lie modules; then, under natural conditions on a (semi)ring, it is shown that all automorphisms of those categories are semi-inner. We thus prove that for a variety _{R}\mathcal{M} of semimodules over an IBN-semiring R (an IBN-semiring is a semiring analog of a ring with IBN), all automorphisms of Aut(_{R}\mathcal{M}^{0}) are semi-inner. Therefore, for a wide range of rings, this solves Problem 12 left open in \cite{plotkin:slotuag}; in particular, for Artinian (Noetherian, PI-) rings R, or a division semiring R, all automorphisms of Aut(_{R}\mathcal{M}^{0}) are semi-inner.
