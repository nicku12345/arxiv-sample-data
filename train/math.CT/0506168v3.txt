We show that the homotopy category of a combinatorial stable model category \ck is well generated. It means that each object K of \Ho(\ck) is an iterated weak colimit of \lambda-compact objects for some cardinal \lambda. A natural question is whether each K is a weak colimit of \lambda-compact objects. We show that this is related to (generalized) Brown representability of \Ho(\mathcal K).
