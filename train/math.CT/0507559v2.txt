Fix a poset P and a natural number n. For various commutative local rings \Lambda, each of Loewy length n, consider the category \textrm{sub}_\Lambda P of \Lambda-linear submodule representations of P. We give a criterion for when the underlying translation quiver of a connected component of the Auslander-Reiten quiver of \textrm{sub}_\Lambda P is independent of the choice of the base ring \Lambda. If \mathcal P is the one-point poset and \Lambda=\mathbb Z/p^n for p a prime number, then \textrm{sub}_\Lambda P consists of all pairs (B;A) where B is a finite abelian p^n-bounded group and A\subset B a subgroup. We can respond to a remark by M. C. R. Butler concerning the first occurence of parametrized families of such subgroup embeddings.
