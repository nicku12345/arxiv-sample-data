The paper is in essence a survey of categories having \phi-weighted colimits for all the weights \phi in some class \Phi. We introduce the class \Phi^+ of {\em \Phi-flat} weights which are those \psi for which \psi-colimits commute in the base \V with limits having weights in \Phi; and the class \Phi^- of {\em \Phi-atomic} weights, which are those \psi for which \psi-limits commute in the base \V with colimits having weights in \Phi. We show that both these classes are {\em saturated} (that is, what was called {\em closed} in the terminology of \cite{AK88}). We prove that for the class \p of {\em all} weights, the classes \p^+ and \p^- both coincide with the class \Q of {\em absolute} weights. For any class \Phi and any category \A, we have the free \Phi-cocompletion \Phi(\A) of \A; and we recognize \Q(\A) as the Cauchy-completion of \A. We study the equivalence between {(\Q(\A^{op}))}^{op} and \Q(\A), which we exhibit as the restriction of the Isbell adjunction between {[\A,\V]}^{op} and [\A^{op},\V] when \A is small; and we give a new Morita theorem for any class \Phi containing \Q. We end with the study of \Phi-continuous weights and their relation to the \Phi-flat weights.
