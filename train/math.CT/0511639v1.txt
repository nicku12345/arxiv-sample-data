Kirill Mackenzie raised the following question: given a groupoid morphism F which is continuous on a neighborhood of base, is it true that F is continuous everywhere? This paper gives a negative answer to that question. Moreover, we prove that for a locally compact groupoid G with non-singleton orbits and having open target projection, if we assume that the continuity of every morphism F on the neighborhood of the base in G implies the continuity of F everywhere, then the groupoid G must be locally transitive.
