In an ongoing project to classify all hereditary abelian categories, we provide a classification of Ext-finite directed hereditary abelian categories satisfying Serre duality up to derived equivalence. In order to prove the classification, we will study the shapes of the Auslander-Reiten components extensively and use appropriate generalisations of tilting objects and coordinates, namely partial tilting sets and probing of objects by quasi-simples.
