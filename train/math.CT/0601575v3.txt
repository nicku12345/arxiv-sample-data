We give a construction of triangulated categories as quotients of exact categories where the subclass of objects sent to zero is defined by a triple of functors. This includes the cases of homotopy and stable module categories. These categories naturally fit into a framework of relative derived categories, and once we prove that there are decent resolutions of complexes, we are able to prove many familiar results in homological algebra.
