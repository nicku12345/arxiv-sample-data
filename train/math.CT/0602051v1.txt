Category theoretic aspects of non-rational conformal field theories are discussed. We consider the case that the category C of chiral sectors is a finite tensor category, i.e. a rigid monoidal category whose class of objects has certain finiteness properties. Besides the simple objects, the indecomposable projective objects of C are of particular interest.   The fusion rules of C can be block-diagonalized. A conjectural connection between the block-diagonalization and modular transformations of characters of modules over vertex algebras is exemplified with the case of the (1,p) minimal models.
