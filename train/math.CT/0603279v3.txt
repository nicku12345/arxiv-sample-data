For a rigid tensor abelian category T over a field k we introduce a notion of a normal quotient q:T\to Q. In case T is a Tannaka category, our notion is equivalent to Milne's notion of a normal quotient. More precisely, if T is the category of finite dimensional representations of a groupoid scheme G over k, then Q is equivalent to the representation category of a normal subgroupoid scheme of G. We describe such a quotient in terms of the subcategory S of T consisting of objects which become trivial in Q. We show that, under some condition on S, Q is uniquely determined by S. If S is an 'etale finite tensor category, we show that the quotient of T by S exists. In particular we show the existence of the base change of T with respect to finite separable field extensions. As an application, we obtain a condition for the exactness of sequences of groupoid schemes in terms of the representation categories.
