Prime objects were defined as generalization of simple objects in the categories of rings (modules). In this paper we introduce and investigate what turns out to be a suitable generalization of simple corings (simple comodules), namely fully coprime corings (fully coprime comodules). Moreover, we consider several primeness notions in the category of comodules of a given coring and investigate their relations with the fully coprimeness and the simplicity of these comodules. These notions are applied then to study primeness and coprimeness properties of a given coring, considered as an object in its category of right (left) comodules.
