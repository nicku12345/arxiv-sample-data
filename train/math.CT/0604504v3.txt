These are expended notes of my talk at the summer institute in algebraic geometry (Seattle, July-August 2005), whose main purpose is to present a global overview on the theory of higher and derived stacks. This text is far from being exhaustive but is intended to cover a rather large part of the subject, starting from the motivations and the foundational material, passing through some examples and basic notions, and ending with some more recent developments and open questions.
