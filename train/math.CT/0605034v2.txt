Braided monoidal categories arise naturally as centres of monoidal categories and have been the focus of much recent attention in both mathematics and physics. By suitably restricting the use of the exchange rule, we obtain a sequent calculus whose categorical semantics may be seen as freely constructing the centre of a monoidal category. This calculus is shown to admit a strongly normalising and confluent cut elimination procedure. The resulting logic fits neatly into the landscape of noncommutative logics and is distinguished by possessing a particularly perspicuous semantics.
