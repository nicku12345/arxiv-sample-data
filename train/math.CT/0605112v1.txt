For a category C we investigate the problem of when the coproduct \bigoplus and the product functor \prod from C^I to C are isomorphic for a fixed set I, or, equivalently, when the two functors are Frobenius functors. We show that for an Ab-category C this happens if and only if the set I is finite. Moreover, this is true even in a much more general case, if there is a morphism in C that is invertible with respect to the addition of morphisms. If C does not have this property we give an example to see that the two functors can be isomorphic for infinite sets I. However we show that \bigoplus and \prod are always isomorphic on a suitable subcategory of C^I which is isomorphic to C^I but is not a full subcategory. For the module category case we provide a different proof to display an interesting connection to the notion of Frobenius corings.
