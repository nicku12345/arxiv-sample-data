Starting from an abelian category A such that every object has only finitely many subobjects we construct a semisimple tensor category T. We show that T interpolates the categories Rep(Aut(p),K) where p runs through certain projective (pro-)objects of A. The main example is A=finite dimensional F_q-vector spaces. Then T can be considered as the category of representations of GL(n,F_q) where n is not a natural number. This work extends a construction of Deligne for symmetric groups.
