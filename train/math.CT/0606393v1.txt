A 2-categorical generalisation of elementary topos is provided and some of the properties of the yoneda structure it generates are explored. Examples relevant to the globular approach to higher category theory are discussed. This paper also contains some expository material on the theory of fibrations internal to a finitely complete 2-category as well as a self-contained development of the necessary background on yoneda structures.
