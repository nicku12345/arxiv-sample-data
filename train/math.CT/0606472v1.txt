In this paper a notion of {\it generalized 2-vector space} is introduced which includes Kapranov and Voevodsky 2-vector spaces. Various kinds of generalized 2-vector spaces are considered and examples are given. The existence of non free generalized 2-vector spaces and of generalized 2-vector spaces which are non Karoubian (hence, non abelian) categories is discussed, and it is shown how any generalized 2-vector space can be identified with a full subcategory of an (abelian) functor category with values in the category {\bf VECT}_K of (possibly infinite dimensional) vector spaces. The corresponding general linear 2-groups \mathbb{G}\mathbb{L}({\bf Vect}_K[\mathcal{C}]) are considered. Specifically, it is shown that \mathbb{G}\mathbb{L}({\bf Vect}_K[\mathcal{C}]) always contains as a (non full) sub-2-group the 2-group {\sf Equiv}_{Cat}(\mathcal{C}) (hence, for finite categories \mathcal{C}, they contain {\sl Weyl sub-2-groups} analogous to usual Weyl subgroups of the general linear groups), and \mathbb{G}\mathbb{L}({\bf Vect}_K[\mathcal{C}]) is explicitly computed (up to equivalence) in a special case of generalized 2-vector spaces which include those of Kapranov and Voevodsky. Finally, other important drawbacks of the notion of generalized 2-vector space, besides the fact that it is in general a non Karoubian category, are also mentioned at the end of the paper.
