In this report, we propose a game semantics model of intuitionistic linear logic with a notion of brackets and a trace operator. This model is a revised version of Conway games augmented with an algebraicly defined gain which enable to describe well bracketed strategies. We then show the existence of a free cocommutative comonoid in the category of Conway. To conclude, we propose a new model of an Algol-like language with higher-order using the presence of a trace operator in our model to describe the memorial aspect of the language.
