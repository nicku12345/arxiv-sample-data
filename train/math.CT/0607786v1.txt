In this paper we study modular G-equivariant fusion categories and their extended Verlinde algebras. We dicuss settings in which fusion rules are diagonalizable. In particular, when G = \mathbb{Z}_{2} we generalize the Verlinde formula. We discuss an important example at length: the type D_{2m+2} quantum subgroup of the semisimple representations of \mathcal{U}_{q}(\mathfrak{sl}_{2}).
