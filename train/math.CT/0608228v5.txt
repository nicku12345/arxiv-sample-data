This paper is an expository account of the theory of stable infinity categories. We prove that the homotopy category of a stable infinity category is triangulated, and that the collection of stable infinity categories is closed under a variety of constructions. We also explain how to construct the derived category of an abelian category (with enough projective objects) as the homotopy category of a suitable stable infinity category; moreover, we characterize this stable infinity category by a universal mapping property.
