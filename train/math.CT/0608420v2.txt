The goal of these talks was to explain how cohomology and other tools of algebraic topology are seen through the lens of n-category theory. Special topics include nonabelian cohomology, Postnikov towers, the theory of "n-stuff", and n-categories for n = -1 and -2. The talks were very informal, and so are these notes. A lengthy appendix clarifies certain puzzles and ventures into deeper waters such as higher topos theory. For readers who want more details, we include an annotated bibliography.
