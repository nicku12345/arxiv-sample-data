As an example of the categorical apparatus of pseudo algebras over 2-theories, we show that pseudo algebras over the 2-theory of categories can be viewed as pseudo double categories with folding or as appropriate 2-functors into bicategories. Foldings are equivalent to connection pairs, and also to thin structures if the vertical and horizontal morphisms coincide. In a sense, the squares of a double category with folding are determined in a functorial way by the 2-cells of the horizontal 2-category. As a special case, strict 2-algebras with one object and everything invertible are crossed modules under a group.
