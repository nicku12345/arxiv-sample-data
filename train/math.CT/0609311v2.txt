We define a Hopf cyclic (co)homology theory in an arbitrary symmetric strict monoidal category. Thus we unify all different types of Hopf cyclic (co)homologies under one single universal theory. We recover Hopf cyclic (co)homology of module algebras, comodule algebras and module coalgebras along with Hopf-Hochschild (co)homology of module algebras. This universal theory also allows us to define the missing Hopf cyclic theory for comodule coalgebras.
