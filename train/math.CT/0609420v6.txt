We discuss two sorts of generalization of Lie groupoids. One is Lie n-groupoids defined as simplicial manifolds with trivial \pi_{k\geq n+1}. The other is the stacky Lie groupoid \cG\rra M with \cG a differentiable stack. We build 1-1 correspondence between Lie 2-groupoids and stacky Lie groupoids up to a certain Morita equivalence. Equivalences of these higher groupoids are described.
