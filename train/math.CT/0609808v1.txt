Quillen defined a {\em model category} to be a category with finite limits and colimits carrying a certain extra structure. In this paper, we show that only finite products and coproducts (in addition to the certain extra structure alluded to above) are really necessary to construct the homotopy category. This leads to the interesting observation that the homotopy category construction could feasibly be iterated.1
