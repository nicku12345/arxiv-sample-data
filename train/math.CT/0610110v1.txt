The notion of a subtractive category, recently introduced by the author, is a ``categorical version'' of the notion of a (pointed) subtractive variety of universal algebras, due to A. Ursini. We show that a subtractive variety \C, whose theory contains a unique constant, is abelian (i.e. \C is the variety of modules over a fixed ring), if and only if the dual category \C^\mathrm{op} of \C, is subtractive. More generally, we show that \C is additive if and only if both \C and \C^\mathrm{op} are subtractive, where \C is an arbitrary finitely complete pointed category, with binary sums, and such that each morphism f in \C can be presented as a composite f=me, where m is a monomorphism and e is an epimorphism.
