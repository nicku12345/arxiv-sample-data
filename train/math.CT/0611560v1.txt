In previous work, we defined the category of functors Fquad, associated to vector spaces over the field with two elements equipped with a nondegenerate quadratic form. In this paper, we define a special family of objects in the category Fquad, named the mixed functors. We give the complete decompositions of two elements of this family that give rise to two new infinite families of simple objects in the category Fquad.
