We study the problem of classifying triangulated categories with finite-dimensional morphism spaces and finitely many indecomposables over an algebraically closed field. We obtain a new proof of the following result due to Xiao and Zhu: the Auslander-Reiten quiver of such a category is of the form \mathbb{Z}\Delta/G where \Delta is a disjoint union of simply laced Dynkin diagrams and G a weakly admissible group of automorphisms of \mathbb{Z}\Delta. Then we prove that for `most' groups G, the category \T is standard, \emph{i.e.} k-linearly equivalent to an orbit category \mathcal{D}^b(\modd k\Delta)/\Phi. This happens in particular when \T is maximal d-Calabi-Yau with d\geq2. Moreover, if \T is standard and algebraic, we can even construct a triangle equivalence between \T and the corresponding orbit category. Finally we give a sufficient condition for the category of projectives of a Frobenius category to be triangulated. This allows us to construct non standard 1-Calabi-Yau categories using deformed preprojective algebras of generalized Dynkin type.
