In this paper we prove that in classifying of complex filiform Leibniz algebras, for which its naturally graded algebra is non-Lie algebra, it suffices to consider some special basis transformations. Moreover, we establish a criterion whether given two such Leibniz algebras are isomorphic in terms of such transformations. The classification problem of filiform Leibniz algebras, for which its naturally graded algebras are non-Lie in an arbitrary dimension, is reduced to the investigation of the obtained conditions.
