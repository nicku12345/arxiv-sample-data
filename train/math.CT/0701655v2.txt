Tamsamani's weak n-groupoids are known to model n-types. In this paper we show that every Tamsamani weak n-groupoid representing a connected n-type is equivalent in a suitable way to a semistrict one. We obtain this result by comparing Tasmamani's weak n-groupoids and cat^(n-1)-groups as models of connected n-types.
