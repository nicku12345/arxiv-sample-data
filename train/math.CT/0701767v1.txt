Operads may be represented as symmetric monoidal functors on a small symmetric monoidal category. We discuss the axioms which must be imposed on a symmetric monoidal functor in order that it give rise to a theory similar to the theory of operads: we call such functors patterns. We also develop the enriched version of the theory, and show how it may be applied to axiomatize topological field theory.
