For an object A of a category of interest \mathbb{C} we construct the group with operations {\mathfrak{B}}(A) and the semidirect product {\mathfrak{B}}(A)\ltimes A and prove that there exists an actor of A in \mathbb{C} if and only if {\mathfrak{B}}(A)\ltimes A \in \mathbb{C}. The cases of groups, Lie, Leibniz, associative, commutative associative, alternative algebras, crossed and precrossed modules are considered. The paper contains some results for the case \Omega_2 = \{+,*,*^{\circ}\}.
