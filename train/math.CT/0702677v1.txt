We use the n-globe with its skeletal filtration to define the fundamental globular omega--groupoid of a filtered space; the proofs use an analogous fundamental cubical omega--groupoid due to the author and Philip Higgins. This method also relates the construction to the fundamental crossed complex of a filtered space, and this relation allows the proof that the crossed complex associated to the free globular omega-groupoid on one element of dimension n is the fundamental crossed complex of the n-globe.
