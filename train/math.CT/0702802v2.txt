We define and systematically study nonassociative C*-algebras as C*-algebras internal to a topological tensor category. We also offer a concrete approach to these C*-algebras, as G-invariant, norm closed *-subalgebras of bounded operators on a G-Hilbert space, with deformed composition product. Our central results are those of stabilization and Takai duality for (twisted) crossed products in this context.
