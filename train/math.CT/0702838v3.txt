This is the first paper in a series. We develop a general deformation theory of objects in homotopy and derived categories of DG categories. Namely, for a DG module E over a DG category we define four deformation functors \Def ^{\h}(E), \coDef ^{\h}(E), \Def (E), \coDef (E). The first two functors describe the deformations (and co-deformations) of E in the homotopy category, and the last two - in the derived category. We study their properties and relations. These functors are defined on the category of artinian (not necessarily commutative) DG algebras.
