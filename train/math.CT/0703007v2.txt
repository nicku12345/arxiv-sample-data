We present polygraphic programs, a subclass of Albert Burroni's polygraphs, as a computational model, showing how these objects can be seen as first-order functional programs. We prove that the model is Turing complete. We use polygraphic interpretations, a termination proof method introduced by the second author, to characterize polygraphic programs that compute in polynomial time. We conclude with a characterization of polynomial time functions and non-deterministic polynomial time functions.
