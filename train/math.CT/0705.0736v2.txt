In this paper, we show another proof of the problem by constructing a strict monoidal category M(C) consisting of M-functors and M-morphisms of a category C and we prove C is equivalent to it. The proof is based on a basic character of monoidal equivalences. Ideas and techniques of these proofs can been used to prove the equivalence between an Ann-category and an almost strict Ann-category.
