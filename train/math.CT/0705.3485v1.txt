We give a summary (without proofs) of the main results in the author's thesis entitled ``Construction of biclosed categories'' (University of New South Wales, Australia, 1970). This summary is reprinted directly from Report 81-0030 of the School of Mathematics and Physics, Macquarie University, April 1981. In particular, it gives sufficient conditions for existence of an extension of a (pro)monoidal category structure along a given dense functor to a cocomplete category. The two basic procedures used in the proof turn out to be special cases of the final result, the two respective dense functors then being the Yoneda embedding followed by a localisation. The final result has a standard universal property based on left Kan extension of (pro)monoidal functors along the given dense functor, however this property is not stated explicitly here.
