The purpose of this paper is to collect the homotopical methods used in the development of the theory of flows initialized by author's paper ``A model category for the homotopy theory of concurrency''. It is presented generalizations of the classical Whitehead theorem inverting weak homotopy equivalences between CW-complexes using weak factorization systems. It is also presented methods of calculation of homotopy limits and homotopy colimits using Quillen adjunctions and Reedy categories.
