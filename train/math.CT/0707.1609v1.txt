Fix a monoidal category C. The 2-category of monads in the 2-category of C-actegories, colax C-equivarant functors, and C-equivariant natural transformations of colax functors, may be recast in terms of pairs consisting of a usual monad and a distributive law between the monad and the action of C, morphisms of monads respecting the distributive law, and transformations of monads satisfying some compatibility with the actions and distributive laws involved. The monads in this picture may be generalized to actions of monoidal categories, and actions of PRO-s in particular. If C is a PRO as well, then in special cases one gets various distributive laws of a given classical type, for example between a comonad and an endofunctor or between a monad and a comonad. The usual pentagons are in general replaced by multigons, and there are also ``mixed'' multigons involving two distinct distributive laws. Beck's bijection between the distributive laws and lifts of one monad to the Eilenberg-Moore category of another monad is here extended to an isomorphism of 2-categories. The lifts of maps of above mentioned pairs are colax C-equivariant. We finish with a short treatment of relative distributive laws between two pseudoalgebra structures which are relative with respect to the distributivity of two pseudomonads involved, what gives a hint toward the generalizations.
