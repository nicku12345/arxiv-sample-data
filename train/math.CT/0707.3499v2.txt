It is well known that Barr and Beck's definition of comonadic homology makes sense also with a functor of coefficients taking values in a semi-abelian category instead of an abelian one. The question arises whether such a homology theory has the same convenient properties as in the abelian case. Here we focus on independence of the chosen comonad: conditions for homology to depend on the induced class of projectives only.
