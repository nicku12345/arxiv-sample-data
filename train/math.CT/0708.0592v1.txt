This paper presents the proof of the coherence theorem for Ann-categories whose set of axioms and original basic properties were given in [9]. Let \A=(\A,{\Ah},c,(0,g,d),a,(1,l,r),{\Lh},{\Rh}) be an Ann-category. The coherence theorem states that in the category  \A, any morphism built from the above isomorphisms and the identification by composition and the two operations \tx, \ts only depends on its source and its target.   The first coherence theorems were built for monoidal and symmetric monoidal categories by Mac Lane [7]. After that, as shown in the References, there are many results relating to the coherence problem for certain classes of categories.   For Ann-categories, applying Hoang Xuan Sinh's ideas used for Gr-categories in [2], the proof of the coherence theorem is constructed by faithfully ``embedding'' each arbitrary Ann-category into a quite strict Ann-category. Here, a {\it quite strict} Ann-categogy is an Ann-category whose all constraints are strict, except for the commutativity and left distributivity ones.   This paper is the work continuing from [9]. If there is no explanation, the terminologies and notations in this paper mean as in [9].
