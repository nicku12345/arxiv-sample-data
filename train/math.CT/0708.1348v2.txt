Each Gr-functor of the type (\varphi,f) of a Gr-category of the type (\Pi,\C) has the obstruction be an element \overline{k}\in H^3(\Pi,\C). When this obstruction vanishes, there exists a bijection between congruence classes of Gr-functors of the type (\varphi,f) and the cohomology group H^2(\Pi,\C). Then the relation of Gr-category theory and the group extension problem can be established and used to prove that each Gr-category is Gr-equivalent to a strict one.
