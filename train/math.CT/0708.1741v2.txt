Any group G gives rise to a 2-group of inner automorphisms, \mathrm{INN}(G). It is an old result by Segal that the nerve of this is the universal G-bundle. We discuss that, similarly, for every 2-group G_{(2)} there is a 3-group \mathrm{INN}(G_{(2)}) and a slightly smaller 3-group \mathrm{INN}_0(G_{(2)}) of inner automorphisms. We describe these for G_{(2)} any strict 2-group, discuss how \mathrm{INN}_0(G_{(2)}) can be understood as arising from the mapping cone of the identity on G_{(2)} and show that its underlying 2-groupoid structure fits into a short exact sequence G_{(2)} \to \mathrm{INN}_0(G_{(2)}) \to \Sigma G_{(2)}.   As a consequence, \mathrm{INN}_0(G_{(2)}) encodes the properties of the universal G_{(2)} 2-bundle.
