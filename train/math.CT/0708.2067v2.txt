I verify the existence of left Bousfield localizations and of enriched left Bousfield localizations, and I prove a collection of useful technical results characterizing certain fibrations of (enriched) left Bousfield localizations. I also use such Bousfield localizations to construct a number of new model categories, including models for the homotopy limit of right Quillen presheaves, for Postnikov towers in model categories, and for presheaves valued in a symmetric monoidal model category satisfying a homotopy-coherent descent condition.
