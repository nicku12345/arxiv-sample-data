Combinatorial model categories were introduced by J. H. Smith as model categories which are locally presentable and cofibrantly generated. He has not published his results yet but proofs of some of them were presented by T. Beke or D. Dugger. We are contributing to this endeavour by proving that weak equivalences in a combinatorial model category form an accessible category. We also present some new results about weak equivalences and cofibrations in combinatorial model categories.
