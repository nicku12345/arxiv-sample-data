Twisted homomorphisms of bialgebras are bialgebra homomorphisms from the first into Drinfeld twistings of the second. They possess a composition operation extending composition of bialgebra homomorphisms. Gauge transformations of twists, compatible with adjacent homomorphisms, give rise to gauge transformation of twisted homomorphisms, which behave nicely with respect to compositions. Here we study (gauge classes of) twisted automorphisms of cocommutative Hopf algebras. After revising well-known relations between twists, twisted forms of bialgebras and R-matrices (for commutative bialgebras) we describe twisted automorphisms of universal enveloping algebras.
