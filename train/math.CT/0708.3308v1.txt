In this paper we study the structure of a class of categories having two operations which satisfy axioms analoguos to that of rings. Such categories are called "Ann - categories". We obtain the classification theorems for regular Ann - categories and Ann - functors by using Mac Lane - Shukla cohomology of rings. These results give new interpretations of the cohomology groups and of the rings
