Injectivity of objects with respect to a set \ch of morphisms is an important concept of algebra, model theory and homotopy theory. Here we study the logic of injectivity consequences of \ch, by which we understand morphisms h such that injectivity with respect to \ch implies injectivity with respect to h. We formulate three simple deduction rules for the injectivity logic and for its finitary version where \mor s between finitely ranked objects are considered only, and prove that they are sound in all categories, and complete in all "reasonable" categories.
