By using a certain second order differential equation, the notion of adapted coordinates on Finsler manifolds is defined and some classifications of complete Finsler manifolds are found. Some examples of Finsler metrics, with positive constant sectional curvature, not necessarily of Randers type nor projectively flat, are found. This work generalizes some results in Riemannian geometry and open up, a vast area of research on Finsler geometry.
