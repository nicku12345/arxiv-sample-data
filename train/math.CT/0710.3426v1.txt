This unpublished note contains some materials taken from my old study note on groupoids and small categories. It contains a proof for the fact that any groupoid is a group bundle over an equivalence relation. Moreover, the action of a category G on a category H as well as the resulting semi-direct product category H\times_\alpha G will be defined (when either G is a groupoid or H^{(0)} = G^{(0)}). If both G and H are groupoids, then H\times_\alpha G is also a groupoid. The reason of producing this note is for people who want to check some details in a recent work of Li.
