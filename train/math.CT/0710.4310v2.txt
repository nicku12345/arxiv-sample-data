We define the thin fundamental categorical group {\mathcal P}_2(M,*) of a based smooth manifold (M,*) as the categorical group whose objects are rank-1 homotopy classes of based loops on M, and whose morphisms are rank-2 homotopy classes of homotopies between based loops on M. Here two maps are rank-n homotopic, when the rank of the differential of the homotopy between them equals n. Let \C(\Gc) be a Lie categorical group coming from a Lie crossed module {\Gc= (\d\colon E \to G,\tr)}. We construct categorical holonomies, defined to be smooth morphisms {\mathcal P}_2(M,*) \to \C(\Gc), by using a notion of categorical connections, being a pair (\w,m), where \w is a connection 1-form on P, a principal G bundle over M, and m is a 2-form on P with values in the Lie algebra of E, with the pair (\w,m) satisfying suitable conditions.   As a further result, we are able to define Wilson spheres in this context.
