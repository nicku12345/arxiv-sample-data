We study Gorenstein categories. We show that such a category has Tate cohomological functors and Avramov-Martsinkovsky exact sequences connecting the Gorenstein relative, the absolute and the Tate cohomological functors. We show that such a category has what Hovey calls an injective model structure and also a projective model structure in case the category has enough projectives. As examples we show that if X is a locally Gorenstein projective scheme then the category Qco(X) of quasi-coherent sheaves on X is such a category and so has these features.
