Consider an algebraic variety X over a base scheme S and a faithful base change T \to S. Given an admissible subcategory \CA in the bounded derived category of coherent sheaves on X, we construct an admissible subcategory in the bounded derived category of coherent sheaves on the fiber product X\times_S T, called the base change of \CA, in such a way that the following base change theorem holds: if a semiorthogonal decomposition of the bounded derived category of X is given then the base changes of its components form a semiorthogonal decomposition of the bounded derived category of the fiber product. As an intermediate step we construct a compatible system of semiorthogonal decompositions of the unbounded derived category of quasicoherent sheaves on X and of the category of perfect complexes on X. As an application we prove that the projection functors of a semiorthogonal decomposition are kernel functors.
