We form tricategories and the homomorphisms between them into a bicategory, whose 2-cells are certain degenerate tritransformations. We then enrich this bicategory into an example of a three-dimensional structure called a locally cubical bicategory, this being a bicategory enriched in the monoidal 2-category of pseudo double categories. Finally, we show that every sufficiently well-behaved locally cubical bicategory gives rise to a tricategory, and thereby deduce the existence of a tricategory of tricategories.
