This is a survey concerning the relationship between Lie Groupoids (and their morphisms) and singular foliations in the sense of Sussmann-Stefan (considered from a purely geometrical point of view). We focus on the interaction between the algebraic and differentiable structures underlying Lie groupoids, and between groups and graphs of equivalence relations, regarded as two basic degeneracies for groupoids. Historical remarks, motivations and examples are developed in five appendices.
