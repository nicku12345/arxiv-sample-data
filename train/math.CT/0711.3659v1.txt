In this paper, we have studied the axiomatics of {\it Ann-categories} and {\it categorical rings.} These are the categories with distributivity constraints whose axiomatics are similar with those of ring structures. The main result we have achieved is proving the independence of the axiomatics of Ann-category definition. And then we have proved that after adding an axiom into the definition of categorical rings, we obtain the new axiomatics which is equivalent to the one of Ann-categories.
