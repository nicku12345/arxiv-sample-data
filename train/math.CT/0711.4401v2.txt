We revisit sheaves on locales by placing them in the context of the theory of quantale modules. The local homeomorphisms p:X\to B are identified with the Hilbert B-modules that are equipped with a natural notion of basis. The homomorphisms of these modules are necessarily adjointable, and the resulting self-dual category yields a description of the equivalence between local homeomorphisms and sheaves whereby morphisms of sheaves arise as the ``operator adjoints'' of the maps of local homeomorphisms.
