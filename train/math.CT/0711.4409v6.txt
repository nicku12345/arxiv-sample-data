This paper has been withdrawn and replaced by arXiv:1309.5035. In this paper we describe some examples of so called spherical functors between triangulated categories, which generalize the notion of a spherical object. We also give sufficient conditions for a collection of spherical functors to yield a weak representation of the category of tangles, and prove a structure theorem for such representations under certain restrictions.
