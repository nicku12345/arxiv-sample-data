We define model category structures on the category of chain complexes over a Grothendieck abelian category depending on the choice of a generating family, and we study their behaviour with respect to tensor products and stabilization. This gives convenient tools to construct and understand triangulated categories of motives and we consider here the case of mixed motives over a regular base scheme.
