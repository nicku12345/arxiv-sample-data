In [TV], Bertrand To\"en and Michel Vaqui\'e define a scheme theory for a closed monoidal category (\mathcal{C},\otimes,1). One of the key ingredients of this theory is the definition of a Zariski topology on the category of commutative monoids in \mathcal{C}. The purpose of this article is to prove that under some hypotheses, Zariski open subobjects of affine schemes can be classified almost as in the usual case of rings (Z-mod,\otimes,Z). The main result states that for any commutative monoid A, the locale of Zariski open subobjects of the affine scheme Spec(A) is associated to a topological space whose points are prime ideals of A and open subsets are defined by the same formula as in rings. As a consequence, we compare the notions of scheme over \mathbb{F}_{1} of [D] and [TV].
