We study the basic monoidal properties of the category of Hopf modules for a coquasi Hopf algebra. In particular we discuss the so called fundamental theorem that establishes a monoidal equivalence between the category of comodules and the category of Hopf modules. We present a categorical proof of Radford's S^4 formula for the case of a finite dimensional coquasi Hopf algebra, by establishing a monoidal isomorphism between certain double dual functors.
