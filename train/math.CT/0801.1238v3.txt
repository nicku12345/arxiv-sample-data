Let G be a Lie group and G\to\Aut(G) be the canonical group homomorphism induced by the adjoint action of a group on itself. We give an explicit description of a 1-1 correspondence between Morita equivalence classes of, on the one hand, principal 2-group [G\to\Aut(G)]-bundles over Lie groupoids and, on the other hand, G-extensions of Lie groupoids (i.e.\ between principal [G\to\Aut(G)]-bundles over differentiable stacks and G-gerbes over differentiable stacks). This approach also allows us to identify G-bound gerbes and [Z(G)\to 1]-group bundles over differentiable stacks, where Z(G) is the center of G. We also introduce universal characteristic classes for 2-group bundles. For groupoid central G-extensions, we introduce Dixmier--Douady classes that can be computed from connection-type data generalizing the ones for bundle gerbes. We prove that these classes coincide with universal characteristic classes. As a corollary, we obtain further that Dixmier--Douady classes are integral.
