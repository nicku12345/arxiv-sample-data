Let k be an algebraically closed field and A a k-linear hereditary category satisfying Serre duality with no infinite radicals between the preprojective objects. If A is generated by the preprojective objects, then we show that A is derived equivalent to rep_k Q for a so called strongly locally finite quiver Q. To this end, we introduce light cone distances and round trip distances on quivers which will be used to investigate sections in stable translation quivers of the form \mathbb{Z} Q.
