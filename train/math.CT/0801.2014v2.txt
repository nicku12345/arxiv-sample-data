In this paper, we introduce the interested reader to homological mirror symmetry. After recalling a little background knowledge, we tackle the simplest cases of homological mirror symmetry: curves of genus zero and one. We close by outlining the current state of the field and mentioning what homo- logical mirror symmetry has to say about other aspects of mirror symmetry.
