A laycle is the categorical analogue of a lazy cocycle. Twines (as introduced by Bruguieres) and strong twines (as introduced by the authors) are laycles satisfying some extra conditions. If c is a braiding, the double braiding c^2 is always a twine; we prove that it is a strong twine if and only if c satisfies a sort of modified braid relation (we call such c pseudosymmetric, as any symmetric braiding satisfies this relation). It is known that symmetric Yetter-Drinfeld categories are trivial; we prove that the Yetter-Drinfeld category _H{\cal YD}^H over a Hopf algebra H is pseudosymmetric if and only if H is commutative and cocommutative. We introduce as well the Hopf algebraic counterpart of pseudosymmetric braidings under the name pseudotriangular structures and prove that all quasitriangular structures on the 2^{n+1}-dimensional pointed Hopf algebras E(n) are pseudotriangular. We observe that a laycle on a monoidal category induces a so-called pseudotwistor on every algebra in the category, and we obtain some general results (and give some examples) concerning pseudotwistors, inspired by properties of laycles and twines.
