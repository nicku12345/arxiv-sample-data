We discuss two generalizations of Lie groupoids. One consists of Lie n-groupoids defined as simplicial manifolds with trivial \pi_{k\geq n+1}. The other consists of stacky Lie groupoids \cG\rra M with \cG a differentiable stack. We build a 1-1 correspondence between Lie 2-groupoids and stacky Lie groupoids up to a certain Morita equivalence. We prove this in a general set-up so that the statement is valid in both differential and topological categories. \Equivalences of higher groupoids in various categories are also described.
