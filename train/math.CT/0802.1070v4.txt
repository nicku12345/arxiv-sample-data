We construct a weak representation of the category of framed affine tangles on a disjoint union of triangulated categories {\mathcal D}_{2n}. The categories we use are that of coherent sheaves on Springer fibers over a nilpotent element of sl_{2n} with two equal Jordan blocks. This representation allows us to enumerate the irreducible objects in the heart of the exotic t-structure on {\mathcal D}_{2n} by crossingless matchings of 2n points on a circle. We also describe the algebra of endomorphisms of the direct sum of the irreducible objects.
