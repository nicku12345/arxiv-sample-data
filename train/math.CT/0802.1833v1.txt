We discuss certain aspects of the combinatorial approach to the differential geometry of non-abelian gerbes, due to W. Messing and the author (arXiv:math.AG/0106083), and give a more direct derivation of the associated cocycle equations. This leads us to a more restrictive definition of the corresponding coboundary relations. We also show that the diagrammatic proofs of certain local curving and curvature equations may be replaced by computations with differential forms.
