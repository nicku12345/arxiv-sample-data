Let A be a ring and \M_A the category of A-modules. It is well known in module theory that for any A -bimodule B, B is an A-ring if and only if the functor -\otimes_A B: \M_A\to \M_A is a monad (or triple).   Similarly, an A -bimodule \C is an A-coring provided the functor -\otimes_A\C:\M_A\to \M_A is a comonad (or cotriple). The related categories of modules (or algebras) of -\otimes_A B and comodules (or coalgebras) of -\otimes_A\C are well studied in the literature. On the other hand, the right adjoint endofunctors \Hom_A(B,-) and \Hom_A(\C,-) are a comonad and a monad, respectively, but the corresponding (co)module categories did not find much attention so far. The category of \Hom_A(B,-)-comodules is isomorphic to the category of B-modules, while the category of \Hom_A(\C,-)-modules (called \C-contramodules by Eilenberg and Moore) need not be equivalent to the category of \C-comodules.   The purpose of this paper is to investigate these categories and their relationships based on some observations of the categorical background. This leads to a deeper understanding and characterisations of algebraic structures such as corings, bialgebras and Hopf algebras. For example, it turns out that the categories of \C-comodules and \Hom_A(\C,-)-modules are equivalent provided \C is a coseparable coring. Furthermore, a bialgebra   H over a commutative ring R is a Hopf algebra if and only if \Hom_R(H-) is a Hopf bimonad on \M_R and in this case the categories of H-Hopf modules and mixed \Hom_R(H,-)-bimodules are both equivalent to \M_R.
