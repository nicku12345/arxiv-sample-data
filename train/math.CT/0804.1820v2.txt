This paper presents the structure conversion by which from an Ann-category \A, we can obtain its reduced Ann-category of the type (R,M) whose structure is a family of five functions k=(\xi,\eta,\alpha,\lambda,\rho). Then we will show that each Ann-category is determined by three invariants:   1. The ring \Pi_0(\A) of the isomorphic classes of objects of \A,   2. \Pi_0(\A)-bimodule \Pi_1(\A) = \Aut_{\A}(0),   3. The element  \bar{k}\in H^{3}_{M}(\Pi_0(\A), \Pi_1(\A)) (the ring cohomology due to MacLane).
