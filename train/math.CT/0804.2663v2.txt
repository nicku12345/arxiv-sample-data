We explain how any cofibrantly generated weak factorisation system on a category may be equipped with a universally and canonically determined choice of cofibrant replacement. We then apply this to the theory of weak omega-categories, showing that the universal and canonical cofibrant replacement of the operad for strict omega-categories is precisely Leinster's operad for weak omega-categories.
