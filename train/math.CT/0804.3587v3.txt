These are the lecture notes for a short course on tensor categories. The coverage in these notes is relatively non-technical, focussing on the essential ideas. They are meant to be accessible for beginners, but it is hoped that also some of the experts will find something interesting in them.   Once the basic definitions are given, the focus is mainly on k-linear categories with finite dimensional hom-spaces. Connections with quantum groups and low dimensional topology are pointed out, but these notes have no pretension to cover the latter subjects at any depth. Essentially, these notes should be considered as annotations to the extensive bibliography.
