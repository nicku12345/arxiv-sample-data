Each Ann-category \A is equivalent to an Ann-category of the type (R,M), where M is an R-bimodule. The family of constraints of A induces a {\it structure} on (R,M). The main result of the paper is:   1. {\it There exists a bijection between the set of structures on (R,M) and the group of Mac Lane 3-cocycles Z^{3}_{MaL}(R, M).}   2. {\it There exists a bijection between C(R,M) of congruence classes of Ann-categories whose pre-stick is of the type (R,M) and the Mac Lane cohomology group H^3_{\textrm{MaL}}(R,M).}
