Notions and techniques of enriched category theory can be used to study topological structures, like metric spaces, topological spaces and approach spaces, in the context of topological theories. Recently in [D. Hofmann, Injective spaces via adjunction, arXiv:0804.0326 [math.CV]] the construction of a Yoneda embedding allowed to identify injectivity of spaces as cocompleteness and to show monadicity of the category of injective spaces and left adjoints over \mathsf{Set}. In this paper we generalise these results, studying cocompleteness with respect to a given class of distributors. We show in particular that the description of several semantic domains presented in [M. Escard\'o and B. Flagg, Semantic domains, injective spaces and monads, Electronic Notes in Theoretical Computer Science 20 (1999)] can be translated into the \mathsf{V}-enriched setting.
