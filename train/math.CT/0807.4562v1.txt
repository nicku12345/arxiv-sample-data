We study the circumstances under which one can reconstruct a stack from its associated functor of isomorphism classes. This is possible surprisingly often: we show that many of the standard examples of moduli stacks are determined by their functors. Our methods seem to exhibit new anabelian-type phenomena, in the form of structures in the category of schemes that encode automorphism data in groupoids.
