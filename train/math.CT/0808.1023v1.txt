This invited chapter in the Handbook of Quantum Logic and Quantum Structures consists of two parts: 1. A substantially updated version of quant-ph/0402130 by the same authors, which initiated the area of categorical quantum mechanics, but had not yet been published in full length; 2. An overview of the progress which has been made since then in this area.
