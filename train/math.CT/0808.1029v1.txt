This paper contains two new results:   1. We amend the notion of abstract basis in a dagger symmetric monoidal category, as well as its corresponding graphical representation, in order to accommodate non-self-dual dagger compact structures; this is crucial for obtaining a `planar' diagrammatical representation of the induced dagger compact structure as well as for representing many complementary bases within one diagrammatic calculus.   2. We (crucially) rely on these basis structures in a purely diagrammatic derivation of the `quantum state transfer protocol'; this derivation provides interesting insights in the distinct structural resources required for state-transfer and teleportation as models of quantum computing.
