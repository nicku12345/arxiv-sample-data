We study the homotopy theory of locally ordered spaces, that is manifolds with boundary whose charts are partially ordered in a compatible way. Their category is not particularly well-behaved with respect to colimits. However, this category turns out to be a certain full subcategory of a topos of sheaves over a simpler site. A precise characterisation of this subcategory is provided. The ambient topos makes available some general homotopical machinery.
