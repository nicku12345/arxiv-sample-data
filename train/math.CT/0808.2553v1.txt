We give a bicategorical version of the main result of A. Masuoka ({Corings and invertible bimodules,} {\em Tsukuba J. Math.} \textbf{13} (1989), 353--362) which proposes a non-commutative version of the fact that for a faithfully flat extension of commutative rings R \subseteq S, the relative Picard group Pic(S/R) is isomorphic to the Amitsur 1--cohomology group H^1(S/R,U) with coefficients in the units functor U.
