The present paper is devoted to study the homotopy category associated with a simplicial descent category (D,s,E) (arXiv:0808.3684v2). We prove that the class E of equivalences has a calculus of left fractions over a quotient category of D modulo homotopy. We study the fiber/cofiber sequences induced by a (co)simplicial descent structure. Examples of such fiber/cofiber sequences are deduced for (commutative) differential graded algebras, simplicial sets or topological spaces. We prove that the homotopy category of a stable simplicial descent category is triangulated. In addition, these triangulated structures may be extended to the homotopy categories of diagram categories of D. As a corollary, we obtain the triangulated structures on: (filtered) derived categories of abelian categories, the derived category of DG-modules over a DG-category, the stable derived category of fibrant spectra and the localized category of mixed Hodge complexes.
