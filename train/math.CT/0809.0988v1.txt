We define weak 2-categories of finite dimensional algebras with bimodules, along with collections of operators \mathbb{O}_{(c,x)} on these 2-categories. We prove that special examples \mathbb{O}_p of these operators control all homological aspects of the rational representation theory of the algebraic group GL_2, over a field of positive characteristic. We prove that when x is a Rickard tilting complex, the operators \mathbb{O}_{(c,x)} honour derived equivalences, in a differential graded setting. We give a number of representation theoretic corollaries, such as the existence of tight \mathbb{Z}_+-gradings on Schur algebras S(2,r), and the existence of braid group actions on the derived categories of blocks of these Schur algebras.
