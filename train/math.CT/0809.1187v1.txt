In this paper we develop a general representation theory for mv-algebras. We furnish the appropriate categorical background to study this problem. Our guide line is the theory of classifying topoi of coherent extensions of universal algebra theories. Our main result corresponds, in the case of mv-algebras and mv-chains, to the representation of commutative rings with unit as rings of global sections of sheaves of local rings. \emph{We prove that any mv-algebra is isomorphic to the mv-algebra of all global sections of a sheaf of mv-chains on a compact topological space}. This result is intimately related to McNaughton's theorem, and we explain why our representation theorem can be viewed as a vast generalization of McNaughton's. On spite of the language utilized in this abstract, we wrote this paper in a way that, we hope, could be read without much acquaintance with either sheaf theory or mv-algebra theory.
