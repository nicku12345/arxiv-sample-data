Starting from any unital colored PROP P, we define a category P(P) of shapes called P-propertopes. Presheaves on P(P) are called P-propertopic sets. For 0 \leq n \leq \infty we define and study n-time categorified P-algebras as P-propertopic sets with some lifting properties. Taking appropriate PROPs P, we obtain higher categorical versions of polycategories, 2-fold monoidal categories, topological quantum field theories, and so on.
