This paper provides geometrical descriptions of the Frobenius monad freely generated by a single object. These descriptions are related to results connecting Frobenius algebras and topological quantum field theories. In these descriptions, which are based on coherence results for self-adjunctions (adjunctions where an endofunctor is adjoint to itself), ordinals in epsilon zero play a prominent role. The paper ends by considering how the notion of Frobenius algebra induces the collapse of the hierarchy of ordinals in epsilon zero, and by raising the question of the exact categorial abstraction of the notion of Frobenius algebra.
