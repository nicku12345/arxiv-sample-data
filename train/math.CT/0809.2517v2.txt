A deeper understanding of recent computations of the Brauer group of Hopf algebras is attained by explaining why a direct product decomposition for this group holds and describing the non-interpreted factor occurring in it. For a Hopf algebra B in a braided monoidal category \C, and under certain assumptions on the braiding (fulfilled if \C is symmetric), we construct a sequence for the Brauer group \BM(\C;B) of B-module algebras, generalizing Beattie's one. It allows one to prove that \BM(\C;B) \cong \Br(\C) \times \Gal(\C;B), where \Br(\C) is the Brauer group of \C and \Gal(\C;B) the group of B-Galois objects. We also show that \BM(\C;B) contains a subgroup isomorphic to \Br(\C) \times \Hc(\C;B,I), where \Hc(\C;B,I) is the second Sweedler cohomology group of B with values in the unit object I of \C. These results are applied to the Brauer group of a quasi-triangular Hopf algebra that is a Radford biproduct B \times H, where H is a usual Hopf algebra over a field K, the Hopf subalgebra generated by the quasi-triangular structure \R is contained in H and B is a Hopf algebra in the category {}_H\M of left H-modules. The Hopf algebras whose Brauer group was recently computed fit this framework. We finally show that \BM(K,H,\R) \times \Hc({}_H\M;B,K) is a subgroup of the Brauer group \BM(K,B \times H,\R), confirming the suspicion that a certain cohomology group of B \times H (second lazy cohomology group was conjectured) embeds into \BM(K,B \times H,\R). New examples of Brauer groups of quasi-triangular Hopf algebras are computed using this sequence.
