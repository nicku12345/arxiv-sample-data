We extend the classical notion of a Reedy category so as to allow non-trivial automorphisms. Our extension includes many important examples occuring in topology such as Segal's category Gamma, or the total category of a crossed simplicial group such as Connes' cyclic category Lambda. For any generalized Reedy category R and any cofibrantly generated model category E, the functor category E^R is shown to carry a canonical model structure of Reedy type.
