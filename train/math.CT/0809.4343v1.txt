It is well known that the internal suplattices in the topos of sheaves on a locale are precisely the modules on that locale. Using enriched category theory and a lemma on KZ doctrines we prove (the generalization of) this fact in the case of ordered sheaves on a small quantaloid. Comparing module-equivalence with sheaf-equivalence for quantaloids and using the notion of centre of a quantaloid, we refine a result of F. Borceux and E. Vitale.
