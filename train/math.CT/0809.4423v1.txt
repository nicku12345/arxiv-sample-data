By replacing the category of smooth vector bundles over a manifold with the category of what we call smooth Euclidean fields, which is a proper enlargement of the former, and by considering smooth actions of Lie groupoids on smooth Euclidean fields, we are able to prove a Tannaka duality theorem for proper Lie groupoids. The notion of smooth Euclidean field we introduce here is the smooth, finite dimensional analogue of the usual notion of continuous Hilbert field.
