We investigate the perfect derived category dgPer(A) of a positively graded differential graded (dg) algebra A whose degree zero part is a dg subalgebra and semisimple as a ring. We introduce an equivalent subcategory of dgPer(A) whose objects are easy to describe, define a t-structure on dgPer(A) and study its heart. We show that dgPer(A) is a Krull-Remak-Schmidt category. Then we consider the heart in the case that A is a Koszul ring with differential zero satisfying some finiteness conditions.
