We describe all fusion subcategories of the representation category of a twisted quantum double of a finite group. In view of the fact that every group-theoretical braided fusion category can be embedded into a representation category of a twisted quantum double of a finite group, this gives a complete description of all group-theoretical braided fusion categories. We describe the lattice and give formulas for some invariants of the fusion subcategories of representation category of a twisted quantum double of a finite group. We also give a characterization of group-theoretical braided fusion categories as equivariantizations of pointed categories.
