A VB-algebroid is essentially defined as a Lie algebroid object in the category of vector bundles. There is a one-to-one correspondence between VB-algebroids and certain flat Lie algebroid superconnections, up to a natural notion of equivalence. In this setting, we are able to construct characteristic classes, which in special cases reproduce characteristic classes constructed by Crainic and Fernandes. We give a complete classification of regular VB-algebroids, and in the process we obtain another characteristic class of Lie algebroids that does not appear in the ordinary representation theory of Lie algebroids.
