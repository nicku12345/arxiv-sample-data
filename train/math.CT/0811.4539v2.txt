It is well known that inverse semigroups are closely related to \'etale groupoids. In particular, it has recently been shown that there is a (non-functorial) equivalence between localic \'etale groupoids, on one hand, and complete and infinitely distributive inverse semigroups (abstract complete pseudogroups), on the other. This correspondence is mediated by a class of quantales, known as inverse quantal frames, that are obtained from the inverse semigroups by a simple join completion that yields an equivalence of categories. Hence, we can regard abstract complete pseudogroups as being essentially ``the same'' as inverse quantal frames, and in this paper we exploit this fact in order to find a suitable replacement for inverse semigroups in the context of open groupoids that are not necessarily \'etale. The interest of such a generalization lies in the importance and ubiquity of open groupoids in areas such as operator algebras, differential geometry and topos theory, and we achieve it by means of a class of quantales, called open quantal frames, which generalize inverse quantal frames and whose properties we study in detail. The resulting correspondence between quantales and open groupoids is not a straightforward generalization of the previous results concerning \'etale groupoids, and it depends heavily on the existence of inverse semigroups of local bisections of the quantales involved.
