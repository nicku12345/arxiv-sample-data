We show that for any finite p-group P of rank at least 2 and any algebraically closed field k of characteristic p the graded center Z^*(\modbar(kP)) of the stable module category of finite-dimensional kP-modules has infinite dimension in each odd degree, and if p=2 also in each even degree. In particular, this provides examples of symmetric algebras A for which Z^0(\modbar(A)) is not finite-dimensional, answering a question raised in [10]
