We here present rudiments of an approach to geometric actions in noncommutative algebraic geometry, based on geometrically admissible actions of monoidal categories. This generalizes the usual (co)module algebras over Hopf algebras which provide affine examples. We introduce a compatibility of monoidal actions and localizations which is a distributive law. There are satisfactory notions of equivariant objects, noncommutative fiber bundles and quotients in this setup.
