It it shown that geometric morphisms between elementary toposes can be represented as adjunctions between the corresponding categories of locales. These adjunctions are characterised as those that preserve the order enrichment, commute with the double power locale monad and whose right adjoints preserve finite coproduct. They are also characterised as those adjunctions that preserve the order enrichment and commute with both the upper and the lower power locale monads.
