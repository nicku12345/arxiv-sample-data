We advance the classification of fusion categories in two directions. Firstly, we completely classify integral fusion categories -- and consequently, semi-simple Hopf algebras -- of dimension pq^2, where p and q are distinct primes. This case is especially interesting because it is the simplest class of dimensions where not all integral fusion categories are group-theoretical. Secondly, we classify a certain family of \ZZ/3\ZZ-graded fusion categories, which are generalizations of the \ZZ/2\ZZ-graded Tambara-Yamagami categories. Our proofs are based on the recently developed theory of extensions of fusion categories.
