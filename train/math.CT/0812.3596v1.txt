After recalling in detail some basic definitions on Hilbert C*-bimodules, Morita equivalence and imprimitivity, we discuss a spectral reconstruction theorem for imprimitivity Hilbert C*-bimodules over commutative unital C*-algebras and consider some of its applications in the theory of commutative full C*-categories.
