We show that a projective space P^\infty(Z/2) endowed with the Alexandrov topology is a classifying space for finite closed coverings of compact quantum spaces in the sense that any such a covering is functorially equivalent to a sheaf over this projective space. In technical terms, we prove that the category of finitely supported flabby sheaves of algebras is equivalent to the category of algebras with a finite set of ideals that intersect to zero and generate a distributive lattice. In particular, the Gelfand transform allows us to view finite closed coverings of compact Hausdorff spaces as flabby sheaves of commutative C*-algebras over P^\infty(Z/2).
