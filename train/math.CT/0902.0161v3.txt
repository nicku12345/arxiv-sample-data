We compare three different ways of defining group cohomology with coefficients in a crossed-module: 1) explicit approach via cocycles; 2) geometric approach via gerbes; 3) group theoretic approach via butterflies. We discuss the case where the crossed-module is braided and the case where the braiding is symmetric. We prove the functoriality of the cohomologies with respect to weak morphisms of crossed-modules and also prove the "long" exact cohomology sequence associated to a short exact sequence of crossed-modules and weak morphisms.
