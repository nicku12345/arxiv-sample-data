Lie theory for the integration of Lie algebroids to Lie groupoids, on the one hand, and of Poisson manifolds to symplectic groupoids, on the other, has undergone tremendous developements in the last decade, thanks to the work of Mackenzie-Xu, Moerdijk-Mrcun, Cattaneo-Felder and Crainic-Fernandes, among others. In this thesis we study - part of - the categorified version of this story, namely the integrability of LA-groupoids (groupoid objects in the category of Lie algebroids), to double Lie groupoids (groupoid objects in the category of Lie groupoids) providing a first set of sufficient conditions for the integration to be possible. Mackenzie's double Lie structures arise naturally from lifting processes, such as the cotangent lift or the path prolongation, on ordinary Lie theoretic and Poisson geometric objects and we use them to study the integrability of quotient Poisson bivector fields, the relation between "local" and "global" duality of Poisson groupoids and Lie theory for Lie bialgebroids and Poisson groupoids.
