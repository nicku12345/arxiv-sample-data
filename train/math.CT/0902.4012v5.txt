Given a complete, cocomplete category \mathcal C, we investigate the problem of describing those small categories I such that the diagonal functor \Delta:\mathcal C\to {\rm Functors}(I,\mathcal C) is a Frobenius functor. This condition can be rephrased by saying that the limits and the colimits of functors I\to\mathcal C are naturally isomorphic. We find necessary conditions on I for a certain class of categories \mathcal C, and, as an application, we give both necessary and sufficient conditions in the two special cases \mathcal C={\bf Set} or _R\mathcal M, the category of left modules over a ring R.
