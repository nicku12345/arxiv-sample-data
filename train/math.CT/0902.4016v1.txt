In this note, we discuss the derived functors of infinite products and homotopy limits. QC(X), the category of quasi-coherent sheaves on a Deligne-Mumford stack X, usually has the property that the derived functors of product vanish after a finite stage. We use this fact to study the convergence of certain homotopy limits and apply it compare the derived category of QC(X) with certain other closely related triangulated categories.
