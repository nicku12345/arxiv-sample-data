In the context of quantaloid-enriched categories, we explain how each saturated class of weights defines, and is defined by, an essentially unique full sub-KZ-doctrine of the free cocompletion KZ-doctrine. The KZ-doctrines which arise as full sub-KZ-doctrines of the free cocompletion, are characterised by two simple "fully faithfulness" conditions. Conical weights form a saturated class, and the corresponding KZ-doctrine is precisely (the generalisation to quantaloid-enriched categories of) the Hausdorff doctrine of [Akhvlediani et al., 2009].
