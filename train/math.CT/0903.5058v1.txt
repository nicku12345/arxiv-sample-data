This paper explores the relationship amongst the various simplicial and pseudo-simplicial objects characteristically associated to any bicategory C. It proves the fact that the geometric realizations of all of these possible candidate `nerves of C' are homotopy equivalent. Any one of these realizations could therefore be taken as the classifying space BC of the bicategory. Its other major result proves a direct extension of Thomason's `Homotopy Colimit Theorem' to bicategories: When the homotopy colimit construction is carried out on a diagram of spaces obtained by applying the classifying space functor to a diagram of bicategories, the resulting space has the homotopy type of a certain bicategory, called the `Grothendieck construction on the diagram'. Our results provide coherence for all reasonable extensions to bicategories of Quillen's definition of the `classifying space' of a category as the geometric realization of the category's Grothendieck nerve, and they are applied to monoidal (tensor) categories through the elemental `delooping' construction.
