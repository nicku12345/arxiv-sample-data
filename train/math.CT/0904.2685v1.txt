We study cocoverings of triangulated categories, in the sense of Rouquier, and prove that for any regular cardinal \alpha the condition of \alpha-compactness, in the sense of Neeman, is local with respect to such cocoverings. This was established for ordinary compactness by Rouquier. Our result yields a new technique for proving that a given triangulated category is well-generated. As an application we describe the \alpha-compact objects in the unbounded derived category of a quasi-compact semi-separated scheme.
