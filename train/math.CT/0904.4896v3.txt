In this paper a systematic study of the category GTS of generalized topological spaces (in the sense of H. Delfs and M. Knebusch) and their strictly continuous mappings begins. Some completeness and cocompleteness results are achieved. Generalized topological spaces help to reconstruct the important elements of the theory of locally definable and weakly definable spaces in the wide context of weakly topological structures.
