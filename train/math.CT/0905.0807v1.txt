Given a sheaf of unital commutative and associative algebras A, first we construct the k-th Grassmann sheaf G_A(k,n) of A^n whose sections induce vector subsheaves of A^n of rank k. Next we show that every vector sheaf over a paracompact space is a subsheaf of A^{\infty}. Finally, applying the preceding results to the universal Grassmann sheaf G_A(n), we prove that vector sheaves of rank n over a paracompact space are classified by the global sections of G_A(n).
