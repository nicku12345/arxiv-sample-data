In here we define the concept of fibered symmetric bimonoidal categories. These are roughly speaking fibered categories D->C whose fibers are symmetric monoidal categories parametrized by C and such that both D and C have a further structure of a symmetric monoidal category that satisfy certain coherences that we describe. Our goal is to show that we can correspond to a fibered symmetric bimonoidal category an E_{\infty}-ring spectrum in a functorial way.
