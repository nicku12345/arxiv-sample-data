We give conditions on a finitary endofunctor of a finitely accessible category to admit a final coalgebra. Our conditions always apply to the case of a finitary endofunctor of a locally finitely presentable (l.f.p.) category and they bring an explicit construction of the final coalgebra in this case. On the other hand, there are interesting examples of final coalgebras beyond the realm of l.f.p. categories to which our results apply. We rely on ideas developed by Tom Leinster for the study of self-similar objects in topology.
