We define a tricategory T of length 3 complexes of abelian sheaves, whose hom-bigroupoids consist of weak morphisms of such complexes. We also define a 3-category 2PIC(S) of Picard 2-stacks, whose hom-2-groupoids consist of additive 2-functors. We prove that these categories are triequivalent as tricategories. As a consequence we obtain a generalization of Deligne's analogous result about Picard stacks in SGA4, Exp. XVIII.
