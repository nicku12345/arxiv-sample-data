Hom-structures (Lie algebras, algebras, coalgebras, Hopf algebras) have been investigated in the literature recently. We study Hom-structures from the point of view of monoidal categories; in particular, we introduce a symmetric monoidal category such that Hom-algebras coincide with algebras in this monoidal category, and similar properties for coalgebras, Hopf algebras and Lie algebras.
