The regular representation of an essentially finite 2-group \mathbb{G} in the 2-category \mathbf{2Vect}_k of (Kapranov and Voevodsky) 2-vector spaces is defined and cohomology invariants classifying it computed. It is next shown that all hom-categories in \mathbf{Rep}_{\mathbf{2Vect}_k}(\mathbb{G}) are 2-vector spaces under quite standard assumptions on the field k, and a formula giving the corresponding "intertwining numbers" is obtained which proves they are symmetric. Finally, it is shown that the forgetful 2-functor {\boldmath\omega}:\mathbf{Rep}_{\mathbf{2Vect}_k}(\mathbb{G})\To\mathbf{2Vect}_k is representable with the regular representation as representing object. As a consequence we obtain a k-linear equivalence between the 2-vector space \mathbf{Vect}_k^{\mathcal{G}} of functors from the underlying groupoid of \mathbb{G} to \mathbf{Vect}_k, on the one hand, and the k-linear category \mathcal{E} nd({\boldmath\omega}) of pseudonatural endomorphisms of {\boldmath\omega}, on the other hand. We conclude that \mathcal{E} nd({\boldmath\omega}) is a 2-vector space, and we (partially) describe a basis of it.
