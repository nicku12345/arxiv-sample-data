It is known that every ribbon category with unimodality allows symmetrized 6j-symbols with full tetrahedral symmetries while a spherical category does not in general. We give an explicit counterexample for this, namely the category \mathcal{E}. We define the mirror conjugate symmetry of 6j-symbols instead and show that 6j-symbols of any unitary spherical category can be normalized to have this property.   As an application, we discuss an exactly soluble model on a honeycomb lattice. We prove that the Levin-Wen Hamiltonian is exactly soluble and hermitian on a unitary spherical category.
