We define the thin fundamental Gray 3-groupoid S_3(M) of a smooth manifold M and define (by using differential geometric data) 3-dimensional holonomies, to be smooth strict Gray 3-groupoid maps S_3(M) \to C(H), where H is a 2-crossed module of Lie groups and C(H) is the Gray 3-groupoid naturally constructed from H. As an application, we define Wilson 3-sphere observables.
