The abelian category of tetramodules over an associative bialgebra A is related with the Gerstenhaber-Schack (GS) cohomology as Ext_\Tetra(A,A)=H_\GS(A). We construct a 2-fold monoidal structure on the category of tetramodules of a bialgebra.   Suppose C is an abelian n-fold monoidal category with the unit object A. We prove, provided some condition (*), that Ext_C(A,A) is an (n+1)-algebra. In the case of bialgebras this condition (*) is satisfied when A is a Hopf algebra. Finally, the GS cohomology of a Hopf algebra is a 3-algebra.   As well, we consider this kind of questions of (bi)algebras over integers. Let A be an associative algebra over Z flat over Z. We prove that the operad acting on its Hochschild cohomology is the operad of stable homotopy groups of the little discs operad.
