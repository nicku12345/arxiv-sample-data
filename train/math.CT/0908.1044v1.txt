We classify indecomposable commutative separable (special Frobenius) algebras and their local modules in (untwisted) group-theoretical modular categories. This gives a description of modular invariants for group-theoretical modular data. As a bi-product we provide an answer to the question when (and in how many ways) two group-theoretical modular categories are equivalent as ribbon categories.
