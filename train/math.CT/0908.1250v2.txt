Motivated by algebraic structures appearing in Rational Conformal Field Theory we study a construction associating to an algebra in a monoidal category a commutative algebra ({\em full centre}) in the monoidal centre of the monoidal category. We establish Morita invariance of this construction by extending it to module categories. As an example we treat the case of group-theoretical categories.
