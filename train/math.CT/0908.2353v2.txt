Our main goal in this paper is to translate the diagram relating groups,   Lie algebras and Hopf algebras to the corresponding 2-objects, i.e. to categorify it. This is done interpreting 2-objects as crossed modules and showing the compatibility of the standard functors linking groups, Lie algebras and Hopf algebras with the concept of a crossed module. One outcome is the construction of an enveloping algebra of the string Lie algebra of Baez-Crans, another is the clarification of the passage from crossed modules of Hopf algebras to Hopf 2-algebras.
