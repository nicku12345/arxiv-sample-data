We explore the interlacing between model category structures attained to classes of modules of finite \mathcal{X}-dimension, for certain classes of modules \mathcal{X}. As an application we give a model structure approach to the Finitistic Dimension Conjectures and present a new conceptual framework in which these conjectures can be studied.
