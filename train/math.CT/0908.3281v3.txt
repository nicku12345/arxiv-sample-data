Let S be a degree six del Pezzo surface over an arbitrary field F. Motivated by the first author's classification of all such S up to isomorphism in terms of a separable F-algebra B \times Q \times F, and by his K-theory isomorphism K_n(S) \cong K_n(B \times Q \times F) for n \ge 0, we prove an equivalence of derived categories  \sD^b(\coh S) \equiv \sD^b(\mod A)  where A is an explicitly given finite dimensional F-algebra whose semisimple part is B \times Q \times F.
