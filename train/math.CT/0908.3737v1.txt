This paper provides an abstract definition of some kinds of logics, called diagrammatic logics, together with a definition of morphisms and of 2-morphisms between diagrammatic logics. The definition of the 2-category of diagrammatic logics rely on category theory, mainly on adjunction, categories of fractions and limit sketches. This framework is applied to the formalization of a parameterization process. This process, which consists in adding a formal parameter to some operations in a given specification, is presented as a morphism of logics. Then the parameter passing process, for recovering a model of the given specification from a model of the parameterized specification and an actual parameter, is seen as a 2-morphism of logics.
