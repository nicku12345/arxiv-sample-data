A braided Ann-category \A is an Ann-category \A together with the braiding c such that (\A, \otimes, a, c, (I,l,r)) is a braided tensor category, and c is compatible with the distributivity constraints. The paper shows the dependence of the left (or right) distributivity constraint on other axioms. Hence, the paper shows the relation to the concepts of {\it distributivity category} due to M. L. Laplaza and {\it ring-like category} due to A. Frohlich and C.T.C Wall.   The center construction of an almost strict Ann-category is an example of an unsymmetric braided Ann-category.
