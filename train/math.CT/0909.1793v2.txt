A semisimple algebraic tensor category over an algebraically closed field k of characteristic zero is the representation category of all finite dimensional twisted super representations of an affine reductive supergroup G over k. Such a supergroup is reductive if and only if its connected component is reductive. The connected component is reductive if and only if the Lie superalgebra divided by its center is a product of simple Lie algebras of classical type and Lie superalgebras spo(1,2r) of the orthosymplectic types BC_r.
