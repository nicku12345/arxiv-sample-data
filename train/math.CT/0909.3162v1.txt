For an associative ring R, let P be an R-module with S=\End_R(P). C.\ Menini and A. Orsatti posed the question of when the related functor \Hom_R(P,-) (with left adjoint P\ot_S-) induces an equivalence between a subcategory of _R\M closed under factor modules and a subcategory of _S\M closed under submodules. They observed that this is precisely the case if the unit of the adjunction is an epimorphism and the counit is a monomorphism. A module P inducing these properties is called a \star-module.   The purpose of this paper is to consider the corresponding question for a functor G:\B\to \A between arbitrary categories. We call G a {\em \star-functor} if it has a left adjoint F:\A\to \B such that the unit of the adjunction is an {\em extremal epimorphism} and the counit is an {\em extremal monomorphism}. In this case (F,G) is an idempotent pair of functors and induces an equivalence between the category \A_{GF} of modules for the monad GF and the category \B^{FG} of comodules for the comonad FG. Moreover, \B^{FG}=\Fix(FG) is closed under factor objects in \B, \A_{GF}=\Fix(GF) is closed under subobjects in \A.
