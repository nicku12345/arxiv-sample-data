Quantum categories were introduced in [4] as generalizations of both bi(co)algebroids and small categories. We clarify details of that work. In particular, we show explicitly how the monadic definition of a quantum category unpacks to a set of axioms close to the definitions of a bialgebroid in the Hopf algebraic literature. We define notions of functor and natural transformation for quantum categories.
