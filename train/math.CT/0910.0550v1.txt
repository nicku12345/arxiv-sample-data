We define a category \galt of g-alternative algebras over a field F and present the category of alternative algebras \alt as a full subcategory of \galt; in the case \ch F\neq 2, we have \alt=\galt. For any g-alternative algebra A we give a construction of a universal strict general actor \cB(A) of A. We define the subset \asoci(A) of A, and show that it is a \cB(A)-substructure of A. We prove that if \asoci(A)=0, then there exists an actor of A in \galt and \act(A)=\cB(A). In particular, we obtain that if A is anticommutative and \ann(A)=0, then there exists an actor of A in \galt; from this, under the same conditions, we deduce the existence of an actor in \alt.
