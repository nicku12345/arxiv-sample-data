In this paper we extend To\"en's derived Hall algebra construction, in which he obtains unital associative algebras from certain stable model categories, to one in which such algebras are obtained from more general stable homotopy theories, in particular stable complete Segal spaces satisfying appropriate finiteness assumptions.
