We discuss homological mirror symmetry of Fermat polynomials in terms of derived Morita equivalence between derived categories of coherent sheaves and Fukaya-Seidel categories (a.k.a. perfect derived categories of directed Fukaya categories), and some related aspects such as stability conditions, (kinds of) modular forms, and Hochschild homologies.
