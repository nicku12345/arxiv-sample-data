Given a pair of adjoint functors between two arbitrary categories it induces mutually inverse equivalences between the full subcategories of the initial ones, consisting of objects for which the arrows of adjunction are isomorphisms. We investigate some cases in which these subcategories may be better characterized. One application is the construction of cellular approximations. Other is the definition and the characterization of (weak) *-objects in the non additive case.
