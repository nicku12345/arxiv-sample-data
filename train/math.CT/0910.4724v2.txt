Let R be a ring and let T be a hereditary torsion class of R-modules. The inclusion of the localizing subcategory generated by T into the derived category of R has a right adjoint, which is a colocalization. Benson has recently shown how to compute this right sdjoint when R is the group ring of a finite group over a prime field and T is the hereditary torsion class generated by a simple module. We generalize Benson's construction to the case where T is any hereditary torsion class on R. This yields an explicit formula for the colocalization with respect to T, using an injective cogenerator for T.
