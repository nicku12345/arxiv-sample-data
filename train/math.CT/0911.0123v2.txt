It is well known that "Fukaya category" is in fact an A_{\infty}-pre-category in sense of Kontsevich and Soibelman \cite{KS}. The reason is that in general the morphism spaces are defined only for transversal pairs of Lagrangians, and higher products are defined only for transversal sequences of Lagrangians. In \cite{KS} it is conjectured that for any graded commutative ring k, quasi-equivalence classes of A_{\infty}-pre-categories over k are in bijection with quasi-equivalence classes of A_{\infty}-categories over k with strict (or weak) identity morphisms.   In this paper we prove this conjecture for essentially small A_{\infty}-(pre-)categories, in the case when k is a field. In particular, it follows that we can replace Fukaya A_{\infty}-pre-category with a quasi-equivalent actual A_{\infty}-category. We also present natural construction of pre-triangulated envelope in the framework of A_{\infty}-pre-categories. We prove its invariance under quasi-equivalences.
