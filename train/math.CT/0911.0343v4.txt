Bezrukavnikov (later together with Arinkin) recovered the work of Deligne defining perverse t-structures for the derived category of coherent sheaves on a projective variety. In this text we prove that these t-structures can be obtained through tilting torsion theories as in the work of Happel, Reiten and Smal\o. This approach proves to be slightly more general as it allows us to define, in the quasi-coherent setting, similar perverse t-structures for certain noncommutative projective planes.
