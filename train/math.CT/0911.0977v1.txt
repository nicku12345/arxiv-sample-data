A classical result of Tannaka duality is the fact that a coalgebra over a field can be reconstructed from its category of finite dimensional representations by using the forgetful functor which sends a representation to its underlying vector space. There is also a corresponding recognition result, which characterizes those categories equipped with a functor to finite dimensional vector spaces which are equivalent to the category of finite dimensional representations of a coalgebra.   In this paper we study a generalization of these questions to an arbitrary cosmos, that is, a complete and cocomplete symmetric monoidal closed category. Instead of representations on finite dimensional vector spaces we look at representations on objects of the cosmos which have a dual. We give a necessary and sufficient condition that ensures that a comonoid can be reconstructed from its representations, and we characterize categories of representations of certain comonoids. We apply this result to certain categories of filtered modules which are used to study p-adic Galois representations.
