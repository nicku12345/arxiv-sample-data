In this paper we call generalized lax epimorphism a functor defined on a ring with several objects, with values in an abelian AB5 category, for which the associated restriction functor is fully faithful. We characterize such a functor with the help of a conditioned right cancellation of another, constructed in a canonical way from the initial one. As consequences we deduce a characterization of functors inducing an abelian localization and also a necessary and sufficient condition for a morphism of rings with several objects to induce an equivalence at the level of two localizations of the respective module categories.
