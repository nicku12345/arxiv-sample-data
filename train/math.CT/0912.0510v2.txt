We construct a functor from the category of graphs to the category of groups which is faithful and "almost" full, in the sense that it induces bijections of the Hom sets up to trivial homomorphisms and conjugation in the category of groups.   We provide several applications of this construction to localizations (i.e. idempotent functors) in the category of groups and the homotopy category.
