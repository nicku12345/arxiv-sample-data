This is the first draft of a book about higher categories approached by iterating Segal's method, as in Tamsamani's definition of n-nerve and Pelissier's thesis. If M is a tractable left proper cartesian model category, we construct a tractable left proper cartesian model structure on the category of M-precategories. The procedure can then be iterated, leading to model categories of (\infty, n)-categories.
