Alain Bruguieres, in his talk [1], announced his work [2] with Alexis Virelizier and the second author which dealt with lifting closed structure on a monoidal category to the category of Eilenberg-Moore algebras for an opmonoidal monad. Our purpose here is to generalize that work to the context internal to an autonomous monoidal bicategory. The result then applies to quantum categories and bialgebroids.
