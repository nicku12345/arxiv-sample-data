We develop a stable analogue to the theory of cosimplicial frames in model cagegories; this is used to enrich all homotopy categories of stable model categories over the usual stable homotopy category and to give a different description of the smash product of spectra which is compared with the known descriptions; in particular, the original smash product of Boardman is identified with the newer smash products coming from a symmetric monoidal model of the stable homotopy category.
