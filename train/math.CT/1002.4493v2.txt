We define a weak bimonad as a monad T on a monoidal category M with the property that the Eilenberg-Moore category M^T is monoidal and the forgetful functor from M^T to M is separable Frobenius. Whenever M is also Cauchy complete, a simple set of axioms is provided, that characterizes the monoidal structure of M^T as a weak lifting of the monoidal structure of M . The relation to bimonads, and the relation to weak bimonoids in a braided monoidal category are revealed. We also discuss antipodes, obtaining the notion of weak Hopf monad.
