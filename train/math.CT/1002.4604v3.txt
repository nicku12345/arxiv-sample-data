We show that the relative Auslander-Buchweitz context on a triangulated category \T coincides with the notion of co-t-structure on certain triangulated subcategory of \T (see Theorem \ref{M2}). In the Krull-Schmidt case, we stablish a bijective correspondence between co-t-structures and cosuspended, precovering subcategories (see Theorem \ref{correspond}). We also give a characterization of bounded co-t-structures in terms of relative homological algebra. The relationship between silting classes and co-t-structures is also studied. We prove that a silting class \omega induces a bounded non-degenerated co-t-structure on the smallest thick triangulated subcategory of \T containing \omega. We also give a description of the bounded co-t-structures on \T (see Theorem \ref{Msc}). Finally, as an application to the particular case of the bounded derived category \D(\HH), where \HH is an abelian hereditary category which is Hom-finite, Ext-finite and has a tilting object (see \cite{HR}), we give a bijective correspondence between finite silting generator sets \omega=\add\,(\omega) and bounded co-t-structures (see Theorem \ref{teoH}).
