Let G and A be objects of a finitely cocomplete homological category \mathbb C. We define a notion of an (internal) action of G of A which is functorially equivalent with a point in \mathbb C over G, i.e. a split extension in \mathbb C with kernel A and cokernel G. This notion and its study are based on a preliminary investigation of cross-effects of functors in a general categorical context. These also allow us to define higher categorical commutators. We show that any proper subobject of an object E (i.e., a kernel of some map on E in \mathbb C) admits a "conjugation" action of E, generalizing the conjugation action of E on itself defined by Bourn and Janelidze. If \mathbb C is semi-abelian, we show that for subobjects X, Y of some object A, X is proper in the supremum of X and Y if and only if X is stable under the restriction to Y of the conjugation action of A on itself. This amounts to an elementary proof of Bourn and Janelidze's functorial equivalence between points over G in \mathbb C and algebras over a certain monad \mathbb T_G on \mathbb C. The two axioms of such an algebra can be replaced by three others, in terms of cross-effects, two of which generalize the usual properties of an action of one group on another.
