This chapter describes interrelations between: (1) algebraic structure on sets of scalars, (2) properties of monads associated with such sets of scalars, and (3) structure in categories (esp. Lawvere theories) associated with these monads. These interrelations will be expressed in terms of "triangles of adjunctions", involving for instance various kinds of monoids (non-commutative, commutative, involutive) and semirings as scalars. It will be shown to which kind of monads and categories these algebraic structures correspond via adjunctions.
