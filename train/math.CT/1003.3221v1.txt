In the theory of coalgebras C over a ring R, the rational functor relates the category of modules over the algebra C^* (with convolution product) with the category of comodules over C. It is based on the pairing of the algebra C^* with the coalgebra C provided by the evaluation map \ev:C^*\ot_R C\to R. We generalise this situation by defining a {\em pairing} between endofunctors T and G on any category \A as a map, natural in a,b\in \A, \beta_{a,b}:\A(a, G(b)) \to \A(T(a),b), and we call it {\em rational} if these all are injective. In case \bT=(T,m_T,e_T) is a monad and \bG=(G,\delta_G,\ve_G) is a comonad on \A, additional compatibility conditions are imposed on a pairing between \bT and \bG. If such a pairing is given and is rational, and \bT has a right adjoint monad \bT^\di, we construct a {\em rational functor} as the functor-part of an idempotent comonad on the \bT-modules \A_{\rT} which generalises the crucial properties of the rational functor for coalgebras. As a special case we consider pairings on monoidal categories.
