We define quasi--locally presentable categories as big unions of coreflective subcategories which are locally presentable. Under appropriate hypotheses we prove a representability theorem for exact contravariant functors defined on a quasi--locally presentable category taking values in abelian groups. We show that the abelianization of a well generated triangulated category is quasi--locally presentable and we obtain a new proof of Brown representability theorem. Examples of functors which are not representable are also given.
