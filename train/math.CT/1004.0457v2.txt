We prove that a monomorphic functor F:Comp\to Comp with finite supports is epimorphic, continuous, and its maximal \emptyset-modification F^\circ preserves intersections. This implies that a monomorphic functor F:Comp\to Comp of finite degree deg F\le n preserves (finite-dimensional) compact ANR's if the spaces F\emptyset, F^\circ\emptyset, and Fn are finite-dimensional ANR's. This improves a known result of Basmanov.
