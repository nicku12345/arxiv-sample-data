The additivity of traces in certain tensor triangulated categories for endomorphisms of finite order of distinguished triangles is investigated. For the identity endomorphism this has been fully established by J. P. May ("The additivity of traces in triangulated categories", Adv. Math., 2001, 163, 34-73). By imposing extra conditions on the coefficients we show how May's result implies a stronger additivity.
