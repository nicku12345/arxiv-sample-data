As a development of [2] and [3], we construct a "VN-bialgebra" in Vect_k for each k-linear split-semigroupal functor from a suitable monoidal category C to Vect_k. The main aim here is to avoid the customary compactness assumptions on generators of the domain category C (cf. [3]). Please note that the VN-bialgebras in Vect_k defined here are not necessarily von Neumann regular as k-algebras in the usual sense, the prefix "VN-" coming from the Set-based case of von Neumann regular semigroups.
