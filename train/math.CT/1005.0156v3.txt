Let R, S be two rings, C an R-coring and {}_{R}^C{\mathcal M} the category of left C-comodules. The category {\bf Rep}\, ( {}_{R}^C{\mathcal M}, {}_{S}{\mathcal M} ) of all representable functors {}_{R}^C{\mathcal M} \to {}_{S}{\mathcal M} is shown to be equivalent to the opposite of the category {}_{R}^C{\mathcal M}_S. For U an (S,R)-bimodule we give necessary and sufficient conditions for the induction functor U\otimes_R - : {}_{R}^C\mathcal{M} \to {}_{S}\mathcal{M} to be: a representable functor, an equivalence of categories, a separable or a Frobenius functor. The latter results generalize and unify the classical theorems of Morita for categories of modules over rings and the more recent theorems obtained by Brezinski, Caenepeel et al. for categories of comodules over corings.
