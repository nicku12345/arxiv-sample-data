In an earlier paper we introduced a notion of Markov automaton, together with parallel operations which permit the compositional description of Markov processes. We illustrated by showing how to describe a system of n dining philosophers, and we observed that Perron-Frobenius theory yields a proof that the probability of reaching deadlock tends to one as the number of steps goes to infinity. In this paper we add sequential operations to the algebra (and the necessary structure to support them). The extra operations permit the description of hierarchical systems, and ones with evolving geometry.
