We formulate an elementary condition on an involutive quantaloid Q under which there is a distributive law from the Cauchy completion monad over the symmetrisation comonad on the category of Q-enriched categories. For such quantaloids, which we call Cauchy-bilateral quantaloids, it follows that the Cauchy completion of any symmetric Q-enriched category is again symmetric. Examples include Lawvere's quantale of non-negative real numbers and Walters' small quantaloids of closed cribles.
