As shown by Happel, from any Frobenius exact category, we can construct a triangulated category as a stable category. On the other hand, it was shown by Iyama and Yoshino that if a pair of subcategories \mathcal{D}\subseteq\mathcal{Z} in a triangulated category satisfies certain conditions (i.e., (\mathcal{Z},\mathcal{Z}) is a \mathcal{D}-mutation pair), then \mathcal{Z}/\mathcal{D} becomes a triangulated category. In this article, we consider a simultaneous generalization of these two constructions.
