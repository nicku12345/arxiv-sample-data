Let \ca be a small dg category over a field k and let \cu be a small full subcategory of the derived category \cd\ca which generate all free dg \ca-modules. Let (\cb,X) be a standard lift of \cu. We show that there is a recollement such that its middle term is \cd\cb, its right term is \cd\ca, and the three functors on its right side are constructed from X. This applies to the pair (A,T), where A is a k-algebra and T is a good n-tilting module, and we obtain a result of Bazzoni--Mantese--Tonolo. This also applies to the pair (\ca,\cu), where \ca is an augmented dg category and \cu is the category of `simple' modules, e.g. \ca is a finite-dimensional algebra or the Kontsevich--Soibelman A_\infty-category associated to a quiver with potential.
