In this research announcement, we propose a new interpretation of the EPR quantization of the BC model using a functor we call the time functor, which is the first example of a CLa-ren functor. Under the hypothesis that the universe is in the Kodama state, we construct a holographic version of the model. Generalisations to other CLa-ren functors and connections to model category theory are considered.
