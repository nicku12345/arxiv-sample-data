In this short survey we give a non-technical introduction to some main ideas of the theory of \infty-categories, hopefully facilitating the digestion of the foundational work of Joyal and Lurie. Besides the basic \infty-categorical notions leading to presentable \infty-categories, we mention the Joyal and Bergner model structures organizing two approaches to a theory of (\infty,1)-categories. We also discuss monoidal \infty-categories and algebra objects, as well as stable \infty-categories. These notions come together in Lurie's treatment of the smash product on spectra, yielding a convenient framework for the study of \mathbb{A}_\infty-ring spectra, \mathbb{E}_\infty-ring spectra, and Derived Algebraic Geometry.
