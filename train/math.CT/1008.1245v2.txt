As a generalization of a Calabi-Yau category, we will say a k-linear Hom-finite triangulated category is fractionally Calabi-Yau if it admits a Serre functor S and there is an n > 0 with S^n = [m]. An abelian category will be called fractionally Calabi-Yau is its bounded derived category is. We provide a classification up to derived equivalence of abelian hereditary fractionally Calabi-Yau categories (for algebraically closed k). They are: the category of finite dimensional representations of a Dynkin quiver, the category of finite dimensional nilpotent representations of a cycle, and the category of coherent sheaves on an elliptic curve or a weighted projective line of tubular type. To obtain this classification, we introduce generalized 1-spherical objects and use them to obtain results about tubes in hereditary categories (which are not necessarily fractionally Calabi-Yau).
