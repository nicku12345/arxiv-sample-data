The \begin{it} Invariance Theorem \end{it} of M. Gerstenhaber and S. D. Schack states that if \mathbb{A} is a diagram of algebras then the subdivision functor induces a natural isomorphism between the Yoneda cohomologies of the category \mathbb{A}-\mathbf{mod} and its subdivided category \mathbb{A}'-\mathbf{mod}. In this paper we generalize this result and show that the subdivision functor is a full and faithful functor between two suitable derived categories of \mathbb{A}-\mathbf{mod} and \mathbb{A}'-\mathbf{mod}. This result combined with our work in [5] and [6], on the Special Cohomology Comparison Theorem, constitutes a generalization of M. Gerstenhaber and S. D. Schack's General Cohomology Comparison Theorem (\mathbf{CCT}).
