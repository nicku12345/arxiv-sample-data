In the first part of this paper, we prove the existence of torsion free covers in the category of representations of quivers, (Q,R-Mod), for a wide class of quivers included in the class of the so-called source injective representation quivers provided that any direct sum of torsion free and injective R-modules is injective. In the second part, we prove the existence of \mathscr{F}_{cw}-covers and \mathscr{F}_{cw}^{\perp}-envelopes for any quiver Q and any ring R with unity, where \mathscr{F}_{cw} is the class of all "componentwise" flat representations of Q.
