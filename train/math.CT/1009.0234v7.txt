In the present paper we propose two interactive directions for the integration of Non-standard Analysis and Category Theory. One direction is to develop a new framework for Non-standard Analysis by making use of an endofunctor on a topos of sets. It gives a new viewpoint for relativization and generalization of Non-standard Analysis. Another direction is to construct a new category by making use of Non-standard methods. As an attempt towards actual applications we introduce a category \varphi Space for the unification of topological and coarse strucutures in terms of our endofunctor approach, giving a new viewpoint for for Coarse Geometry.
