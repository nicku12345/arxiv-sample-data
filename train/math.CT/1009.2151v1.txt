From the viewpoint of semi-abelian homology, some recent results on homology of Leibniz n-algebras can be explained categorically. In parallel with these results, we develop an analogous theory for Lie n-algebras. We also consider the relative case: homology of Leibniz n-algebras relative to the subvariety of Lie n-algebras.
