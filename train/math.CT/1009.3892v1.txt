The main source of inspiration for the present paper is the work of R. Rosebrugh and R.J. Wood on constructive complete distributive lattices where the authors employ elegantly the concepts of adjunction and module in their study of ordered sets. Both notions (suitably adapted) are available in topology too, which permits us to investigate topological, metric and other kinds of spaces in a similar spirit. Therefore, relative to a choice \Phi of modules, we consider spaces which admit all colimits with weight in \Phi, as well as (suitably defined) \Phi-distributive and \Phi-algebraic spaces. We show that the category of \Phi-distributive spaces and \Phi-colimit preserving maps is dually equivalent to the idempotent splitting completion of a category of spaces and convergence relations between them. We explain the connection of these results to the traditional duality of spaces with frames, and conclude further duality theorems. Finally, we study properties and structures of the resulting categories, in particular monoidal (closed) structures.
