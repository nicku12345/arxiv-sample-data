We show that the category of finite-dimensional modules over the endomorphism algebra of a rigid object in a Hom-finite triangulated category is equivalent to the Gabriel-Zisman localisation of the category with respect to a certain class of maps. This generalises the 2-Calabi-Yau tilting theorem of Keller-Reiten, in which the module category is obtained as a factor category, to the rigid case.
