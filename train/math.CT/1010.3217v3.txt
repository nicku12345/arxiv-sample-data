We construct a tensor functor from the category of super representations of the superlinear group Gl(m,n) over a field of characteristic zero to the category of super representations of the linear group Gl(m-n) over some extension field (for m at least equal to n). We show that this functor maps irreducible representations to isotypic representations, and we compute the multiplicities.
