The introduction of the categorical notion of closure operators has unified various important notions and has led to interesting examples and applications in diverse areas of mathematics (see for example, Dikranjan and Tholen (\cite{DT})). For a topological space it is well-known that the associated closure and interior operators provide equivalent descriptions of the topology, but this is not true in general. So, it makes sense to define and study the notion of interior operators I in the context of a category \mathfrak C and a fixed class \mathcal M of monomorphisms in \mathfrak C closed under composition in such a way that \mathfrak C is finitely \mathcal M-complete and the inverse images of morphisms have both left and right adjoint, which is the purpose of this paper.
