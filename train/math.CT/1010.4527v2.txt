The main result of this paper is the construction of a trace and a trace pairing for endomorphisms satisfying suitable conditions in a monoidal category. This construction is a common generalization of the trace for endomorphisms of dualizable ob jects in a balanced monoidal category and the trace of nuclear operators on a locally convex topological vector space with the approximation property.
