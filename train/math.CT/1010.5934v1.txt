The theory of Touchard polynomials is generalized using a method based on the definition of exponential operators, which extend the notion of the shift operator. The proposed technique, along with the use of the relevant operational formalism, allows the straightforward derivation of properties of this family of polynomials and their relationship to different forms of Stirling numbers.
