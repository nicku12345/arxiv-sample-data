An abelian category with arbitrary coproducts and a small projective generator is equivalent to a module category \cite{Mit}. A tilting object in a abelian category is a natural generalization of a small projective generator. Moreover, any abelian category with a tilting object admits arbitrary coproducts \cite{CGM}. It naturally arises the question when an abelian category with a tilting object is equivalent to a module category. By \cite{CGM} the problem simplifies in understanding when, given an associative ring R and a faithful torsion pair (\X,\Y) in the category of right R-modules, the \emph{heart of the t-structure} \H(\X,\Y) associated to (\X,\Y) is equivalent to a category of modules. In this paper we give a complete answer to this question, proving necessary and sufficient condition on (\X,\Y) for \H(\X,\Y) to be equivalent to a module category. We analyze in detail the case when R is right artinian.
