An abelian Krull-Schmidt category is said to be uniserial if the isomorphism classes of subobjects of a given indecomposable object form a linearly ordered poset. In this paper, we classify the hereditary uniserial categories with Serre duality. They fall into two types: the first type is given by the representations of the quiver A_n with linear orientation (and infinite variants thereof), the second type by tubes (and an infinite variant). These last categories give a new class of hereditary categories with Serre duality, called big tubes.
