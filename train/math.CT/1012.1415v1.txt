A braided Ann-category \mathcal A is an Ann-category \mathcal A together with a braiding c such that (\mathcal A, \otimes, a, c, (1,l,r)) is a braided tensor category, moreover c is compatible with the distributivity constraints. According to the structure transport theorem, the paper shows that each braided Ann-category is equivalent to a braided Ann-category of the type (R,M), hence the proof of the classification theorem for braided Ann-categories by the cohomology of commutative rings is presented.
