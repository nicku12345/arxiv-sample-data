In a previous paper we lifted Charles Rezk's complete Segal model structure on the category of simplicial spaces to a Quillen equivalent one on the category of "relative categories," and our aim in this successor paper is to obtain a more explicit description of the weak equivalences in this model structure by showing that these weak equivalences are exactly the DK-equivalences, i.e. those maps between relative categories which induce a weak equivalence between their simplicial localizations.
