Model theoretic internality provides conditions under which the group of automorphisms of a model over a reduct is itself a definable group. In this paper we formulate a categorical analogue of the condition of internality, and prove an analogous result on the categorical level. The model theoretic statement is recovered by considering the category of definable sets.
