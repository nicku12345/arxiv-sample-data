Integral cluster categories of acyclic quivers have recently been used in the representation-theoretic approach to quantum cluster algebras. We show that over a principal ideal domain, such categories behave much better than one would expect: They can be described as orbit categories, their indecomposable rigid objects do not depend on the ground ring and the mutation operation is transitive.
