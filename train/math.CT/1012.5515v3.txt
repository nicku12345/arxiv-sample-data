In this paper, we give the categorification of Leibniz algebras, which is equivalent to 2-term sh Leibniz algebras. They reveal the algebraic structure of omni-Lie 2-algebras introduced in \cite{omniLie2} as well as twisted Courant algebroids by closed 4-forms introduced in \cite{4form}.   We also prove that Dirac structures of twisted Courant algebroids give rise to 2-term L_\infty-algebras and geometric structures behind them are exactly H-twisted Lie algebroids introduced in \cite{Grutzmann}.
