We introduce the notion of the quotient of a category C by the action A : M \longrightarrow C \times C of a unital symmetric monoidal category M. The quotient C/M is a 2-category. We prove its existence and uniqueness by first showing that every small 2-category has a presentation in terms of generators and relations and then describing the generators and relations needed for the quotient C/M.
