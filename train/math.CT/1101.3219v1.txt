We introduce the category HG, whose objects are topological groupoids endowed with compatible measure theoretic data: a Haar system and a measure on the unit space. We then define and study the notion of weak-pullback in the category of topological groupoids, and subsequently in HG. The category HG is the setting for topological groupoidification, which we present in separate papers, and in which the weak pullback is a key ingredient.
