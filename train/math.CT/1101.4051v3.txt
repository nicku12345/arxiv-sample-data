We propose a natural definition of a category of matrix factorizations for nonaffine Landau-Ginzburg models. For any LG-model we construct a fully faithful functor from the category of matrix factorizations defined in this way to the triangulated category of singularities of the corresponding fiber. We also show that this functor is an equivalence if the total space of the LG-model is smooth.
