Main contribution of this paper is an investigation of expressive power of the database category DB. An object in this category is a database-instance (set of n-ary relations). Morphisms are not functions but have complex tree structures based on a set of complex query computations. They express the semantics of view-based mappings between databases. The higher (logical) level scheme mappings between databases, usually written in some high expressive logical language, may be functorially translated into this base "computation" DB category . The behavioral point of view for databases is assumed, with behavioural equivalence of databases corresponding to isomorphism of objects in DB category. The introduced observations, which are view-based computations without side-effects, are based (from Universal algebra) on monad endofunctor T, which is the closure operator for objects and for morphisms also. It was shown that DB is symmetric (with a bijection between arrows and objects) 2-category, equal to its dual, complete and cocomplete. In this paper we demonstrate that DB is concrete, locally small and finitely presentable. Moreover, it is enriched over itself monoidal symmetric category with a tensor products for matching, and has a parameterized merging database operation. We show that it is an algebraic lattice and we define a database metric space and a subobject classifier: thus, DB category is a monoidal elementary topos.
