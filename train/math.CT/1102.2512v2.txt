In this note we consider partial model categories, by which we mean relative categories that satisfy a weakened version of the model category axioms involving only the weak equivalences. More precisely, a partial model category will be a relative category that has the two out of six property and admits a 3-arrow calculus.   We then show that Charles Rezk's result that the simplicial space obtained from a simplicial model category by taking a Reedy fibrant replacement of its simplicial nerve is a complete Segal space also holds for these partial model categories.   We also note that conversely every complete Segal space is Reedy equivalent to the simplicial nerve of a partial model category and in fact of a homotopically full subcategory of a category of diagrams of simplicial sets.
