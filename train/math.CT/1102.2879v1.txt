In recent years, Benson, Iyengar and Krause have developed a theory of stratification for compactly generated triangulated categories with an action of a graded commutative Noetherian ring. Stratification implies a classification of localizing and thick subcategories in terms of subsets of the prime ideal spectrum of the given ring. In this paper two stratification results are presented: one for the derived category of a commutative ring-spectrum with polynomial homotopy and another for the derived category of cochains on certain spaces. We also give the stratification of cochains on a space a topological content.
