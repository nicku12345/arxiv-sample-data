We show that the quotient of a Hom-finite triangulated category C by the kernel of the functor Hom(T, -), where T is a rigid object, is preabelian. We further show that the class of regular morphisms in the quotient admit a calculus of left and right fractions. It follows that the Gabriel-Zisman localisation of the quotient at the class of regular morphisms is abelian. We show that it is equivalent to the category of finite dimensional modules over the endomorphism algebra of T in C.
