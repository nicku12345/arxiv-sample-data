For a finite group G, a semi-Mackey (resp. Tambara) functor is regarded as a G-bivariant analog of a commutative monoid (resp. ring). As such, some naive algebraic constructions are generalized to this G-bivariant setting. In this article, as a G-bivariant analog of the fraction of a ring, we consider {\it fraction} of a Tambara (and a semi-Mackey) functor, by a multiplicative semi-Mackey subfunctor.
