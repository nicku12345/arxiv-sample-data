Clemens Berger showed that Weak Omega Categories of Michael Batanin can be defined as model of a certain kind of theories that he called "homogeneous theories". By using the work of Mark Weber on the Abstract Nerves for the specific case of the n-Transformations (n\in {\mathbb{N}^*}), we show that we can also define Weak Omega Functors, Weak Omega Natural Transformations, and so on, as models of certain kind of colored theories which are homogeneous as well.
