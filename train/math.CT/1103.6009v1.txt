If T is a commutative monad on a cartesian closed category, then there exists a natural T-bilinear pairing from T(X) times the space of T(1)-valued functions on X ("integration"), as well as a natural T-bilinear action on T(X) by the space of these functions. These data together make the endofunctors T and "functions into T(1)" into a system of extensive/intensive quantities, in the sense of Lawvere. A natural monad map from T to a certain monad of distributions (in the sense of functional analysis (Schwartz)) arises from this integration.
