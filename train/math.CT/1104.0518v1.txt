We prove that the relative commutator with respect to a subvariety of a variety of Omega-groups introduced by the first author can be described in terms of categorical Galois theory. This extends the known correspondence between the Froehlich-Lue and the Janelidze-Kelly notions of central extension. As an example outside the context of Omega-groups we study the reflection of the category of loops to the category of groups where we obtain an interpretation of the associator as a relative commutator.
