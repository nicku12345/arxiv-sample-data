We characterize the tripos-to-topos construction of Hyland, Johnstone and Pitts as a biadjunction in a bicategory enriched category of equipment-like structures. These abstract concepts are necessary to handle the presence of oplax constructs --- the construction is only oplax functorial on certain classes of cartesian functors between triposes. A by-product of our analysis is the decomposition of the tripos-to-topos construction into two steps, the intermediate step being a weakened version of quasitoposes.
