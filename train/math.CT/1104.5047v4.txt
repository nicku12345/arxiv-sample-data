We define a class of lattice models for two-dimensional topological phases with boundary such that both the bulk and the boundary excitations are gapped. The bulk part is constructed using a unitary tensor category \calC as in the Levin-Wen model, whereas the boundary is associated with a module category over \calC. We also consider domain walls (or defect lines) between different bulk phases. A domain wall is transparent to bulk excitations if the corresponding unitary tensor categories are Morita equivalent. Defects of higher codimension will also be studied. In summary, we give a dictionary between physical ingredients of lattice models and tensor-categorical notions.
