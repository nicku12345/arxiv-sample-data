We provide an overview of the hybrid compositional distributional model of meaning, developed in Coecke et al. (arXiv:1003.4394v1 [cs.CL]), which is based on the categorical methods also applied to the analysis of information flow in quantum protocols. The mathematical setting stipulates that the meaning of a sentence is a linear function of the tensor products of the meanings of its words. We provide concrete constructions for this definition and present techniques to build vector spaces for meaning vectors of words, as well as that of sentences. The applicability of these methods is demonstrated via a toy vector space as well as real data from the British National Corpus and two disambiguation experiments.
