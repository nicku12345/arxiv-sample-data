We give a definition of the action of a tensor triangulated category T on a triangulated category K. In the case that T is rigidly-compactly generated and K is compactly generated we show this gives rise to a notion of supports which categorifies work of Benson, Iyengar, and Krause and extends work of Balmer and Favi. We prove that a suitable version of the local-to-global principle holds very generally. A relative version of the telescope conjecture is formulated and we give a sufficient condition for it to hold.
