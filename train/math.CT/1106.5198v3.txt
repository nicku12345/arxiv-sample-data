Paterson showed how to construct an etale groupoid from an inverse semigroup using ideas from functional analysis. This construction was later simplified by Lenz. We show that Lenz's construction can itself be further simplified by using filters: the topological groupoid associated with an inverse semigroup is precisely a groupoid of filters. In addition, idempotent filters are closed inverse subsemigroups and so determine transitive representations by means of partial bijections. This connection between filters and representations by partial bijections is exploited to show how linear representations of inverse semigroups can be constructed from the groups occuring in the associated topological groupoid.
