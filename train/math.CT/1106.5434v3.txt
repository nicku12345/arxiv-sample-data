We study abelian group objects in \omega-categories and discuss the well-known Dold-Kan correspondence from the perspective of \omega-categories as a model for strict \infty-categories. The first part of the paper is intended to compile results from the existing literature and to fill some gaps therein. We go on to consider a parameterized Dold-Kan correspondence, i.e. a Dold-Kan correspondence for presheaves of \omega-categories. The main result is to describe the descent or sheaf condition in terms of a glueing condition that is familiar for 1 and 2-stacks.
