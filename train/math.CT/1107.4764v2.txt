For any graded commutative noetherian ring, where the grading group is abelian and where commutativity is allowed to hold in a quite general sense, we establish an inclusion-preserving bijection between, on the one hand, the twist-closed localizing subcategories of the derived category, and, on the other hand, subsets of the homogeneous spectrum of prime ideals of the ring. We provide an application to weighted projective schemes.
