Idempotent analogues of convexity are introduced. It is proved that the category of algebras for the capacity monad in the category of compacta is isomorphic to the category of (\max,\min)-idempotent biconvex compacta and their biaffine maps. It is also shown that the category of algebras for the monad of sup-measures ((\max,\min)-idempotent measures) is isomorphic to the category of (\max,\min)-idempotent convex compacta and their affine maps.
