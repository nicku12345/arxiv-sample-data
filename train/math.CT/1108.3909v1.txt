Basing ourselves on the concept of double central extension from categorical Galois theory, we study a notion of commutator which is defined relative to a Birkhoff subcategory B of a semi-abelian category A. This commutator characterises Janelidze and Kelly's B-central extensions; when the subcategory B is determined by the abelian objects in A, it coincides with Huq's commutator; and when the category A is a variety of omega-groups, it coincides with the relative commutator introduced by the first author.
