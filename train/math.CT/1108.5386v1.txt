We summarize our axioms for higher categories, and describe the blob complex. Fixing an n-category C, the blob complex associates a chain complex B_*(W;C) to any n-manifold W. The 0-th homology of this chain complex recovers the usual topological quantum field theory invariants of W. The higher homology groups should be viewed as generalizations of Hochschild homology (indeed, when W=S^1 they coincide). The blob complex has a very natural definition in terms of homotopy colimits along decompositions of the manifold W. We outline the important properties of the blob complex, and sketch the proof of a generalization of Deligne's conjecture on Hochschild cohomology and the little discs operad to higher dimensions.
