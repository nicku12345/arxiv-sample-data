A subcategory \textbf{C} of a groupoid \mathbb{G} is a left order in \mathbb{G}, if every element of \mathbb{G} can be written as a^{-1}b where a, b \in \textbf{C}. A subsemigroupoid \mathfrak{C} of a groupoid \mathbb{G} is a left q-order in \mathbb{G}, if every element of \mathbb{G} can be written as a^{-1}b where a, b \in \mathfrak{C}. We give a characterization of left orders (q-orders) in groupoids. In addition, we describe the relationship between left I-orders in primitive inverse semigroups and left orders (q-orders) in groupoids.
