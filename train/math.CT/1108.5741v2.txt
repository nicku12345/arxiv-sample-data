The aim of the present paper is to extend the dualizing object approach to Stone duality to the non-commutative setting of skew Boolean algebras. This continues the study of non-commutative generalizations of different forms of Stone duality initiated in recent papers by Bauer and Cvetko-Vah, Lawson, Lawson and Lenz, Resende, and also the current author. In particular, we construct a series of dual adjunctions between the categories of Boolean spaces and skew Boolean algebras, unital versions of which are induced by dualizing objects {0,1,..., n+1}, n\geq 0. We describe Eilenberg-Moore categories of the monads of our adjunctions and construct easily understood non-commutative reflections of skew Boolean algebras, where the latter can be faithfully embedded (if n\geq 1) in a canonical way. As an application, we answer the question that arose in a recent paper by Leech and Spinks to describe the left adjoint to their `twisted product' functor \omega.
