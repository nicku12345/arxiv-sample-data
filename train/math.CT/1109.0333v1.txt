This paper begins the discussion of how the Information Flow Framework can be used to provide a principled foundation for the metalevel (or structural level) of the Standard Upper Ontology (SUO). This SUO structural level can be used as a logical framework for manipulating collections of ontologies in the object level of the SUO or other middle level or domain ontologies. From the Information Flow perspective, the SUO structural level resolves into several metalevel ontologies. This paper discusses a KIF formalization for one of those metalevel categories, the Category Theory Ontology. In particular, it discusses its category and colimit sub-namespaces.
