Using Butz and Moerdijk's topological groupoid representation of a topos with enough points, a `syntax-semantics' duality for geometric theories is constructed. The emphasis is on a logical presentation, starting with a description of the semantical topological groupoid of models and isomorphisms of a theory and a direct proof that this groupoid represents its classifying topos. Using this representation, a contravariant adjunction is constructed between theories and topological groupoids. The restriction of this adjunction yields a contravariant equivalence between theories with enough models and semantical groupoids. Technically a variant of the syntax-semantics duality constructed in [Awodey and Forssell, arXiv:1008.3145v1] for first-order logic, the construction here works for arbitrary geometric theories and uses a slice construction on the side of groupoids---reflecting the use of `indexed' models in the representation theorem---which in several respects simplifies the construction and allows for an intrinsic characterization of the semantic side.
