Dialectical logic is the logic of dialectical processes. The goal of dialectical logic is to introduce dynamic notions into logical computational systems. The fundamental notions of proposition and truth-value in standard logic are subsumed by the notions of process and flow in dialectical logic. Dialectical logic has a standard aspect, which can be defined in terms of the "local cartesian closure" of subtypes. The standard aspect of dialectical logic provides a natural program semantics which incorporates Hoare's precondition/postcondition semantics and extends the standard Kripke semantics of dynamic logic. The goal of the standard aspect of dialectical logic is to unify the logic of small-scale and large-scale programming.
