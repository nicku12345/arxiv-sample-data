Given a strict Lie 2-algebra, we can integrate it to a strict Lie 2-group by integrating the corresponding Lie algebra crossed module. On the other hand, the integration procedure of Getzler and Henriques will also produce a 2-group. In this paper, we show that these two integration results are Morita equivalent. As an application, we integrate a non-strict morphism between Lie algebra crossed modules to a generalized morphism between their corresponding Lie group crossed modules.
