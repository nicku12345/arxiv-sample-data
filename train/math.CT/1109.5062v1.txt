Let R be a ring with a set of local units, and a homomorphism of groups \underline{\Theta} : \G \to \Picar{R} to the Picard group of R. We study under which conditions \underline{\Theta} is determined by a factor map, and, henceforth, it defines a generalized crossed product with a same set of local units. Given a ring extension R \subseteq S with the same set of local units and assuming that \underline{\Theta} is induced by a homomorphism of groups \G \to \Inv{R}{S} to the group of all invertible R-sub-bimodules of S, then we construct an analogue of the Chase-Harrison-Rosenberg seven terms exact sequence of groups attached to the triple (R \subseteq S, \underline{\Theta}), which involves the first, the second and the third cohomology groups of \G with coefficients in the group of all R-bilinear automorphisms of R. Our approach generalizes the works by Kanzaki and Miyashita in the unital case.
