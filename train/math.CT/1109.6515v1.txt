Given a triangulated category over a field K and a field extension L/K, we investigate how one can construct a triangulated category over L. Our approach produces the derived category of the base change scheme X_L if the category one starts with is the bounded derived category of a smooth projective variety X over K and the field extension is finite and Galois. We also investigate how the dimension of a triangulated category behaves under scalar extensions.
