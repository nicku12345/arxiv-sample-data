For coalgebras C over a field, we study when the categories {}^C\Mm of left C-comodules and \Mm^C of right C-comodules are symmetric categories, in the sense that there is a duality between the categories of finitely presented unitary left R-modules and finitely presented unitary left L-modules, where R and L are the functor rings associated to the finitely accessible categories {}^C\Mm and \Mm^C.
