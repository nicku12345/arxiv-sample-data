For a ring R, the properties of being (left) selfinjective or being cogenerator for the left R-modules do not imply one another, and the two combined give rise to the important notion of PF-rings. For a coalgebra C, (left) self-projectivity implies that C is generator for right comodules and the coalgebras with this property were called right quasi-co-Frobenius; however, whether the converse implication is true is an open question. We provide an extensive study of this problem. We show that this implication does not hold, by giving a large class of examples of coalgebras having the "generating property". In fact, we show that any coalgebra C can be embedded in a coalgebra C_\infty that generates its right comodules, and if C is local over an algebraically closed field, then C_\infty can be chosen local as well. We also give some general conditions under which the implication "C-projective (left) \Rightarrow C generator for right comodules" does work, and such conditions are when C is right semiperfect or when C has finite coradical filtration.
