In this paper, we introduce the notions of hom-Lie 2-algebras, which is the categorification of hom-Lie algebras, HL_\infty-algebras, which is the hom-analogue of L_\infty-algebras, and crossed modules of hom-Lie algebras. We prove that the category of hom-Lie 2-algebras and the category of 2-term HL_\infty-algebras are equivalent. We give a detailed study on skeletal hom-Lie 2-algebras. In particular, we construct the hom-analogues of the string Lie 2-algebras associated to any semisimple involutive hom-Lie algebras. We also proved that there is a one-to-one correspondence between strict hom-Lie 2-algebras and crossed modules of hom-Lie algebras. We give the construction of strict hom-Lie 2-algebras from hom-left-symmetric algebras and symplectic hom-Lie algebras.
