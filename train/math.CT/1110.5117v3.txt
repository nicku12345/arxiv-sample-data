We give an alternate formulation of pseudo-coherence over an arbitrary derived stack X. The full subcategory of pseudo-coherent objects forms a stable sub-infinity-category of the derived category associated to X. Using relative Tor-amplitude we define a derived stack classifying pseudo-coherent objects. For reasonable base schemes, this classifies the bounded derived category. In the case that X is a projective derived scheme flat over the base, we show the moduli is locally geometric and locally of almost finite type. Using this result, we prove the existence of a derived motivic Hall algebra associated to X.
