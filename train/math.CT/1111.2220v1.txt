For an exact category having enough projective objects, we establish a bijection between thick subcategories containing the projective objects and thick subcategories of the stable derived category. Using this bijection we classify thick subcategories of finitely generated modules over local complete intersections and produce generators for the category of coherent sheaves on a separated noetherian scheme with an ample family.
