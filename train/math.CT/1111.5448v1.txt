Protoadditive functors are designed to replace additive functors in a non-abelian setting. Their properties are studied, in particular in relationship with torsion theories, Galois theory, homology and factorisation systems. It is shown how a protoadditive torsion-free reflector induces a chain of derived torsion theories in the categories of higher extensions, similar to the Galois structures of higher central extensions previously considered in semi-abelian homological algebra. Such higher central extensions are also studied, with respect to Birkhoff subcategories whose reflector is protoadditive or, more generally, factors through a protoadditive reflector. In this way we obtain simple descriptions of the non-abelian derived functors of the reflectors via higher Hopf formulae. Various examples are considered in the categories of groups, compact groups, internal groupoids in a semi-abelian category, and other ones.
