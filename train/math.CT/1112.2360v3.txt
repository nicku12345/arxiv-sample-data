Let k be a field of any characteristic. In this paper, we construct a functorial cofibrant resolution \mathfrak{R}(A) for the \mathbb{Z}_{\le 0}-graded dg algebras A over k, such that the functor A\rightsquigarrow \mathfrak{R}(A) is colax-monoidal with quasi-isomorphisms as the colax maps. More precisely, there are maps of bifunctors \mathfrak{R}(A\otimes B)\to \mathfrak{R}(A)\otimes \mathfrak{R}(B), compatible with the projections to A\otimes B, and obeying the colax-monoidal axiom.   The main application of such resolutions (which we consider in our next paper) is the existence of a colax-monoidal dg localization of pre-triangulated dg categories, such that the localization is a genuine dg category, whose image in the homotopy category of dg categories is isomorphic to the To\"{e}n's dg localization.
