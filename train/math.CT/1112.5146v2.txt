In this paper we study spaces of algebras over an operad (non-symmetric) in symmetric monoidal model categories. We first compute the homotopy fiber of the forgetful functor sending an algebra to its underlying object, extending a result of Rezk. We then apply this computation to the construction of geometric moduli stacks of algebras over an operad in a homotopical algebraic geometry context in the sense of To\"en and Vezzosi. We show under mild hypotheses that the moduli stack of unital associative algebras is a Zariski open substack of the moduli stack of non-necessarily unital associative algebras. The classical analogue for finite-dimensional vector spaces was noticed by Gabriel.
