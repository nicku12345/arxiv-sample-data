C*-categories are essentially norm-closed *-categories of bounded linear operators between Hilbert spaces. The purpose of this work is to identify suitable axioms defining Krein C*-categories, i.e. those categories that play the role of C*-categories whenever Hilbert spaces are replaced by more general indefinite inner product Krein spaces, and provide some basic examples. Finally we provide a Gel'fand-Naimark representation theorem for Krein C*-algebras and Krein C*-categories.
