In this paper, we introduce the atom spectrum of an abelian category as a topological space consisting of all the equivalence classes of monoform objects. In terms of the atom spectrum, we give a classification of Serre subcategories of an arbitrary noetherian abelian category. Moreover we show that the atom spectrum of a locally noetherian Grothendieck category is homeomorphic to its Ziegler spectrum.
