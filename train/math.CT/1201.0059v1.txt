This paper proves that the category of vacant n-tuple groupoids is equivalent to the category of factorizations of groupoids by n subgroupoids. Moreover it extends this equivalence to the category of maximally exclusive n-tuple groupoids, that we define, and (n+1)-factorizations of groupoids with a normal abelian subgroupoid. Finally it shows that in the smooth case, such a factorization gives a presentation of the Poincar\'e group as a triple groupoid.
