We construct a model structure on the category of small categories enriched over a combinatorial closed symmetric monoidal model category satisfying the monoid axiom. Weak equivalences are Dwyer-Kan equivalences, i.e. enriched functors which induce weak equivalences on morphism objects and equivalences of ordinary categories when we take sets of connected components on morphism objects.
