We review the definition of bulk and boundary conformal field theory in a way suited for logarithmic conformal field theory. The notion of a maximal bulk theory which can be non-degenerately joined to a boundary theory is defined. The purpose of this construction is to obtain the more complicated bulk theories from simpler boundary theories. We then describe the algebraic counterpart of the maximal bulk theory, namely the so-called full centre of an algebra in an abelian braided monoidal category. Finally, we illustrate the previous discussion in the example of the W(2,3)-model with central charge 0.
