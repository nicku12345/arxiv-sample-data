Inspired by Segal-Stolz-Teichner project for geometric construction of elliptic (tmf) cohomology, and ideas of Floer theory and of Hopkins-Lurie on extended TFT's, we geometrically construct some Ring-valued representable cofunctors on the homotopy category of topological spaces. Using a classical computation in Gromov-Witten theory due to Seidel we show that for one version of these cofunctors \pi_{2} of the representing space is non trivial, provided a certain categorical extension of Kontsevich conjecture holds for the symplectic manifold  \mathbb{CP} ^{n}, for some some n \geq 1. This gives further evidence for existence of generalized cohomology theories built from field theories living on a topological space.
