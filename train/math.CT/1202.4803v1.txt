We study aisles in the derived category of a hereditary abelian category. Given an aisle, we associate a sequence of subcategories of the abelian category by considering the different homologies of the aisle. We then obtain a sequence, called a narrow sequence.   We then prove that a narrow sequence in a hereditary abelian category consists of a nondecreasing sequence of wide subcategories, together with a tilting torsion class in each of these wide subcategories. Furthermore, there are relations these torsion classes have to satisfy. These results are sufficient to recover known classifications of t-structures for smooth projective curves, and for finitely generated modules over a Dedekind ring.   In some special cases, including the case of finite dimensional modules over a finite dimensional hereditary algebra, we can reduce even further, effectively decoupling the different tilting torsion theories one chooses in the wide subcategories.
