We develop further the techniques presented in [M. Mombelli. On the tensor product of bimodule categories over Hopf algebras. Preprint arXiv:1111.1610 ] to study bimodule categories over the representation categories of arbitrary finite-dimensional Hopf algebras. We compute the Brauer-Picard group of equivalence classes of exact invertible bimodule categories over the representation categories of a certain large family of pointed non-semisimple Hopf algebras, the so called supergroup algebras. To obtain this result we first give a classification of equivalence classes of exact indecomposable bimodule categories over such Hopf algebras.
