We introduce fusion, contragradient and braiding of Hilbert affine representations of a subfactor planar algebra P (not necessarily having finite depth). We prove that if N \subset M is a subfactor realization of P, then the Drinfeld center of the N-N-bimodule category generated by _N L^2 (M)_M, is equivalent to the category of Hilbert affine representations of P satisfying certain finiteness criterion. As a consequence, we prove Kevin Walker's conjecture for planar algebras.
