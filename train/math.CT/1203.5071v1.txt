One aim of this paper is to develop some aspects of the theory of monoidal derivators. The passages from categories and model categories to derivators both respect monoidal objects and hence give rise to natural examples. We also introduce additive derivators and show that the values of strong, additive derivators are canonically pretriangulated categories. Moreover, the center of additive derivators allows for a convenient formalization of linear structures and graded variants thereof in the stable situation. As an illustration of these concepts, we discuss some derivators related to chain complexes and symmetric spectra.
