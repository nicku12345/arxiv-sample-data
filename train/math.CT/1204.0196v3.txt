The Grothendieck construction of a diagram X of categories can be seen as a process to construct a single category \Gr(X) by gluing categories in the diagram together. Here we formulate diagrams of categories as colax functors from a small category I to the 2-category \kCat of small \k-categories for a fixed commutative ring \k. In our previous paper we defined derived equivalences of those colax functors. Roughly speaking two colax functors X, X' \colon I \to \kCat are derived equivalent if there is a derived equivalence from X(i) to X'(i) for all objects i in I satisfying some "I-equivariance" conditions. In this paper we glue the derived equivalences between X(i) and X'(i) together to obtain a derived equivalence between Grothendieck constructions \Gr(X) and \Gr(X'), which shows that if colax functors are derived equivalent, then so are their Grothendieck constructions. This generalizes and well formulates the fact that if two \k-categories with a G-action for a group G are "G-equivariantly" derived equivalent, then their orbit categories are derived equivalent. As an easy application we see by a unified proof that if two \Bbbk-algebras A and A' are derived equivalent, then so are the path categories AQ and A'Q for any quiver Q; so are the incidence categories AS and A'S for any poset S; and so are the monoid algebras AG and A'G for any monoid G. Also we will give examples of gluing of many smaller derived equivalences together to have a larger derived equivalence.
