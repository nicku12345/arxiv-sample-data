In this paper, we construct derived equivalences between two subrings of relevant \Phi-Auslander-Yoneda rings from an arbitrary short exact sequence in an abelian category. As a consequence, any short exact sequence in an abelian category gives rise to a derived equivalence between two subrings of endomorphism rings. These results generalize some methods on constructing derived equivalences.
