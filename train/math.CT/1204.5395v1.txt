Let \A be a finitely generated semigroup with 0. An \A-module over \fun (also called an \A--set), is a pointed set (M,*) together with an action of \A. We define and study the Hall algebra \H_{\A} of the category \C_{\A} of finite \A--modules. \H_{\A} is shown to be the universal enveloping algebra of a Lie algebra \n_{\A}, called the \emph{Hall Lie algebra} of \C_{\A}. In the case of the \fm - the free monoid on one generator \fm, the Hall algebra (or more precisely the Hall algebra of the subcategory of nilpotent \fm-modules) is isomorphic to Kreimer's Hopf algebra of rooted forests. This perspective allows us to define two new commutative operations on rooted forests. We also consider the examples when \A is a quotient of \fm by a congruence, and the monoid G \cup \{0\} for a finite group G.
