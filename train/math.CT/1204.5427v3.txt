We present general techniques for constructing functorial factorizations appropriate for model structures that are not known to be cofibrantly generated. Our methods use "algebraic" characterizations of fibrations to produce factorizations that have the desired lifting properties in a completely categorical fashion. We illustrate these methods in the case of categories enriched, tensored, and cotensored in spaces, proving the existence of Hurewicz-type model structures, thereby correcting an error in earlier attempts by others. Examples include the categories of (based) spaces, (based) G-spaces, and diagram spectra among others.
