This is the second part of a work initiated in \cite{GaHa}, where we constructed a model category, \Qt, for set theory. In the present paper we use this model category to introduce homotopy-theoretic intuitions to set theory. Our main observation is that the homotopy invariant version of cardinality is the covering number of Shelah's PCF theory, and that other combinatorial objects, such as Shelah's revised power function - the cardinal function featuring in Shelah's revised GCH theorem - can be obtained using similar tools. We include a small "dictionary" for set theory in \QtNaamen, hoping it will help in finding more meaningful homotopy-theoretic intuitions in set theory.
