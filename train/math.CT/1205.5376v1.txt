In this article, we interconnect two different aspects of higher category theory, in one hand the theory of infinity categories and on an other hand the theory of 2-categories.We construct an explicit functorial path objet in the model category of topological categories. We discuss some properties and consequences of such path object. We also explain the construction of a 2-monad which algebras are (symmetric) monoidal topological categories. Finally, we explain the relationship with the eventual model structure on the category of T-algebras.
