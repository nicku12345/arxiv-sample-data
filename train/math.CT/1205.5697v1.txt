We define the Grothendieck group of an n-angulated category and show that for odd n its properties are as in the special case of n=3, i.e. the triangulated case. In particular, its subgroups classify the dense and complete n-angulated subcategories via a bijective correspondence. For a tensor n-angulated category, the Grothendieck group becomes a ring, whose ideals classify the dense and complete n-angulated tensor ideals of the category.
