We study the universal measuring coalgebras P(A,B) of Sweedler and the universal measuring comodules Q(M,N) of Batchelor. We show that these universal objects exist in a very general context. We provide a detailed proof of an observation of Wraith, that the P(A,B) are the hom-objects of an enrichment of algebras in coalgebras. We show also that the Q(M,N) provide an enrichment of the global category of modules in the global category of comodules.
