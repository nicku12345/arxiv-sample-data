Spurred by the new examples found by Kornel Szlach\'anyi of a form of lax monoidal category, the author felt the time ripe to publish a reworking of Eilenberg-Kelly's original paper on closed categories appropriate to the laxer context. The new examples are connected with bialgebroids. With Stephen Lack, we have also used the concept to give an alternative definition of quantum category and quantum groupoid. Szlach\'anyi has called the lax notion {\em skew monoidal}. This paper defines {\em skew closed category}, proves Yoneda lemmas for categories enriched over such, and looks at closed cocompletion.
