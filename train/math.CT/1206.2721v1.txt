We extend work of Balmer, associating filtrations of essentially small tensor triangulated categories to certain dimension functions, to the setting of actions of rigidly-compactly generated tensor triangulated categories on compactly generated triangulated categories. We show that the towers of triangles associated to such a filtration can be used to produce filtrations of Gorenstein injective quasi-coherent sheaves on Gorenstein schemes. This extends and gives a new proof of a result of Enochs and Huang. In the case of local complete intersections a further refinement of this filtration is given and we comment on some special properties of the associated spectral sequence in this case.
