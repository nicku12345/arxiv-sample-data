We study the difference between internal categories and internal groupoids in terms of generalised Mal'tsev properties---the weak Mal'tsev property on the one hand, and n-permutability on the other. In the first part of the article we give conditions on internal categorical structures which detect whether the surrounding category is naturally Mal'tsev, Mal'tsev or weakly Mal'tsev. We show that these do not depend on the existence of binary products. In the second part we focus on varieties of algebras.
