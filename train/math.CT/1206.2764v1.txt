Under certain conditions, a scheme can be reconstructed from its category of quasi-coherent sheaves. The Tannakian reconstruction theorem provides another example where a geometric object can be reconstructed from an associated category, in this case the category of its finite dimensional representations. Lurie's result that the pseudofunctor which sends a geometric stack to its category of quasi-coherent sheaves is fully faithful provides a conceptual explanation for why this works.   In this paper we prove a generalized Tannakian recognition theorem, in order to characterize a part of the image of the extension of the above pseudofunctor to algebraic stacks in the sense of Naumann. This allows us to further investigate a conjecture by Richard Pink about categories of filtered modules, which were defined by Fontaine and Laffaille to construct p-adic Galois representations.   In order to do this we give a new characterization of Adams Hopf algebroids, which also allows us to answer a question posed by Mark Hovey.
