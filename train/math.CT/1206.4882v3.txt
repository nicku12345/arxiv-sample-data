Recent results by Keller and Nicol{\'a}s and by Koenig and Yang have shown bijective correspondences between suitable classes of t-structures and co-t-structures with certain objects of the derived category: silting objects. On the other hand, the techniques of glueing (co-)t-structures along a recollement play an important role in the understanding of derived module categories. Using the above correspondence with silting objects we present explicit constructions of glueing of silting objects, and, furthermore, we answer the question of when is the glued silting tilting.
