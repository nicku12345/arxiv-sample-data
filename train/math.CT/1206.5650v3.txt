We consider recollements of derived categories of dg-algebras induced by self orthogonal compact objects obtaining a generalization of Rickard's Theorem. Specializing to the case of partial tilting modules over a ring, we extend the results on triangle equivalences proved in [B2] and [BMT]. In the end we focus on the connection between recollements of derived categories of rings, bireflective subcategories and generalized universal localizations".
