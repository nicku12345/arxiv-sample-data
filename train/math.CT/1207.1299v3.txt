Varagnolo and Vasserot conjectured an equivalence between the category O for a cyclotomic Rational Cherednik algebra and a truncation of an affine parabolic category O of type A. In this paper we reduce their conjecture to some purely combinatorial conjecture. Our principal tool for the reduction is the theory of categorical sl_2-actions on highest weight categories. Then we prove our combinatorial conjecture in some cases.
