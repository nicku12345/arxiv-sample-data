We determine the endomorphism categories of cell 2-representations of fiat 2-categories associated with strongly regular two-sided cells under some natural assumptions. Along the way, we completely describe J-simple fiat 2-categories which have only one two-sided cell J apart from the identities, under the same conditions as above. For positively graded 2-categories, we show that the additional restrictions are redundant.
