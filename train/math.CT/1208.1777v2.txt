We extend the Quillen Theorem Bn for homotopy fibers of Dwyer, et al. to similar results for homotopy pullbacks and note that these results imply similar results for zigzags in the categories of relative categories and k-relative categories, not only with respect to their Reedy structures but also their Rezk structure, which turns them into models for the theories of (infinity, 1)- and (infinity, k)-categories, respectively.
