We combine two recent ideas: cartesian differential categories, and restriction categories. The result is a new structure which axiomatizes the category of smooth maps defined on open subsets of \R^n in a way that is completely algebraic. We also give other models for the resulting structure, discuss what it means for a partial map to be additive or linear, and show that differential restriction structure can be lifted through various completion operations.
