For a Koszul operad \mathcal{P}, there are several existing approaches to the notion of a homotopy between homotopy morphisms of homotopy \mathcal{P}-algebras. Some of those approaches are known to give rise to the same notions. We exhibit the missing links between those notions, thus putting them all into the same framework. The main nontrivial ingredient in establishing this relationship is the homotopy transfer theorem for homotopy cooperads due to Drummond-Cole and Vallette.
