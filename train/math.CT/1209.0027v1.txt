Double vector bundles may be dualized in two distinct ways and these duals are themselves dual. These two dualizations generate a group, denoted \mathscr{D}\mathscr{F}_2, which is the symmetric group S_3 on three symbols. In the case of triple vector bundles the authors proved in a previous paper that the corresponding group \mathscr{D}\mathscr{F}_3 is an extension of S_4 by the Klein four-group. In this paper we show that the group \mathscr{D}\mathscr{F}_n, for n-fold vector bundles, n\geq 3, is an extension of S_{n+1} by a certain product of groups of order 2, and show that the centre is nontrivial if and only if n is a multiple of 4. The methods employ an interpretation of duality operations in terms of certain graphs on (n+1) vertices.
