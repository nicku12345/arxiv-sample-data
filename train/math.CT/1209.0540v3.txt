We study certain integer valued length functions on triangulated categories and establish a correspondence between such functions and cohomological functors taking values in the category of finite length modules over some ring. The irreducible cohomological functions form a topological space. We discuss its basic properties and include explicit calculations for the category of perfect complexes over some specific rings.
