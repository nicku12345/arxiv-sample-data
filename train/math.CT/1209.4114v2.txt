The category _{A}\mathbb{S}_{A} of bisemimodules over a semialgebra A, with the so called Takahashi's tensor product -\boxtimes_{A}-, is semimonoidal but not monoidal. Although not a unit in _{A}\mathbb{S}%_{A}, the base semialgebra A has properties of a semiunit (in a sense which we clarify in this note). Motivated by this interesting example, we investigate semiunital semimonoidal categories (\mathcal{V}%, \bullet, I) as a framework for studying notions like semimonoids (semicomonoids) as well as a notion of monads (comonads) which we call \mathbb{J}-monads (\mathbb{J}-% comonads) with respect to the endo-functor \mathbb{J}:=\mathbf{I}\bullet -\simeq -\bullet \mathbf{I}:\mathcal{V}\longrightarrow \mathcal{V}. This motivated also introducing a more generalized notion of monads (comonads) in arbitrary categories with respect to arbitrary endo-functors. Applications to the semiunital semimonoidal variety (_{A}\mathbb{S}%_{A},\boxtimes_{A},A) provide us with examples of semiunital A-semirings (semicounital A-semicorings) and semiunitary semimodules (semicounitary semicomodules) which extend the classical notions of unital rings (counital corings) and unitary modules (counitary comodules).
