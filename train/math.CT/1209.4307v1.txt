Let C be small category and A an arbitrary category. Consider the category C(A) whose objects are functors from C to A, and whose morphisms are natural transformations. Given a functor F : A --> B one obtains an induced functor F_C : C(A) --> C(B) . If A and B are abelian categories, we have that C(A) and C(B) are also abelian, and one has two functors R(F_C) : D(C(A)) --> D(C(B)) and (RF)_ C : C(D(A)) --> C(D (B)). The goals of this paper are: 1) to find a relationship between D (C(A)) and C(D(A)); 2) to relate the functors R(F_C) and (RF)_C. As an application, we prove a version of Mukai's Theorem for quiver sheaves.
