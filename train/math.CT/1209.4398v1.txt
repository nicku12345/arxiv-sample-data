Higher dimensional central extensions of groups were introduced by G. Janelidze as particular instances of the abstract notion of covering morphism from categorical Galois theory. More recently, the notion has been extended to and studied in arbitrary semi-abelian categories. In this article, we further extend the scope to exact Mal'tsev categories and beyond.
