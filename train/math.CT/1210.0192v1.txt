In this paper, based on the same techniques as in \cite{BENZ08} for the construction of a formally smooth map V \to Perf from the variety of complexes to the Artin \infty-stack Perf, we explicitly construct a new Artin  \infty -stack of Maurer-Cartan elements of a dg-category  \mathcal {P}  denoted by \mathcal{MC_P} , with a map  V \to \mathcal{MC_P}  which we show to be formally smooth.
