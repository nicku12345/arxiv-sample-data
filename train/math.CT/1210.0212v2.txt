Inspired by Lurie's theory of quasi-unital algebras we prove an analogous result for \infty-categories. In particular, we show that the unital structure of an \infty-category can be uniquely recovered from the underlying non-unital structure once suitable candidates for units have been identified. The main result of this paper can be used to produce a proof for the 1-dimensional cobordism hypothesis, as described in a forthcoming paper.
