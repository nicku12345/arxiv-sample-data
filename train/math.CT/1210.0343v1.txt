We prove that the bounded derived category of the surface S constructed by Barlow admits a length 11 exceptional sequence consisting of (explicit) line bundles. Moreover, we show that in a small neighbourhood of S in the moduli space of determinantal Barlow surfaces, the generic surface has a semiorthogonal decomposition of its derived category into a length 11 exceptional sequence of line bundles and a category with trivial Grothendieck group and Hochschild homology, called a phantom category. This is done using a deformation argument and the fact that the derived endomorphism algebra of the sequence is constant. Applying Kuznetsov's results on heights of exceptional sequences, we also show that the sequence on S itself is not full and its (left or right) orthogonal complement is also a phantom category.
