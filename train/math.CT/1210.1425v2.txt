We prove an analogon of the the fundamental homomorphism theorem for certain classes of exact and essentially surjective functors of Abelian categories \mathscr{Q}:\mathcal{A} \to \mathcal{B}. It states that \mathscr{Q} is up to equivalence the Serre quotient \mathcal{A} \to \mathcal{A} / \mathrm{ker} \mathscr{Q}, even in cases when the latter does not admit a section functor. For several classes of schemes X, including projective and toric varieties, this characterization applies to the sheafification functor from a certain category \mathcal{A} of finitely presented graded modules to the category \mathcal{B}=\mathfrak{Coh} X of coherent sheaves on X. This gives a direct proof that \mathfrak{Coh} X is a Serre quotient of \mathcal{A}.
