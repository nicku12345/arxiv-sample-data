In this paper we describe the unramified Langlands correspondence for two-dimensional local fields, we construct a categorical analogue of the unramified principal series representations and study its properties. The main tool for this description is the construction of a central extension. For this (and other) central extension we prove noncommutative reciprocity laws (i.e. the splitting of the central extensions over some subgroups) for arithmetic surfaces and projective surfaces over a finite field. These reciprocity laws connect central extensions which are constructed locally and globally.
