We introduce the notion of double cosets relative to two fusion subcategories of a fusion category. Given a tensor functor F : \C \to \D between fusion categories, we introduce an equivalence relation \approx^F on the set \Lambda_\C of isomorphism classes of simple objects of \C, and when F is dominant, an equivalence relation \approx_F on \Lambda_\D. We show that the equivalent classes of \approx^F are cosets. We also give a description of the image of F when it is a normal tensor functor, and we show that F is normal if and only if the images of \approx^F equivalent elements of \Lambda_\C are colinear. We study the situation where the composition of two tensor functors F=F'F" is normal, and we give a criterion of normality for F", with an application to equivariantizations. Lastly, we introduce the radical of a fusion subcategory and compare it to its commutator in the case of a normal subcategory. We also give a description for the image of a normal tensor functor between any two fusion categories.
