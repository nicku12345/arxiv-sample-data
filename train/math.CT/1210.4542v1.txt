We prove an abstract Fubini-type theorem in the context of monoidal and enriched category theory, and as a corollary we establish a Fubini theorem for integrals on arbitrary convergence spaces that generalizes (and entails) the classical Fubini theorem for Radon measures on compact Hausdorff spaces. Given a symmetric monoidal closed adjunction satisfying certain hypotheses, we show that an associated monad of natural distributions D is commutative. Applying this result to the monoidal adjunction between convergence spaces and convergence vector spaces, the commutativity of D amounts to a Fubini theorem for continuous linear functionals on the space of scalar functions on an arbitrary convergence space.
