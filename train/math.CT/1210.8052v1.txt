Let A be an algebra over a commutative ring k. It is known that the categories of non-commutative descent data, of comodules over the Sweedler canonical coring, of right A-modules with a flat connection are isomorphic as braided monoidal categories to the center of the category of A-bimodules. We prove that the braiding on these categories is unique if there exists a k-linear unitary map E : A \to Z(A). This condition is satisfied if k is a field or A is a commutative or a separable algebra.
