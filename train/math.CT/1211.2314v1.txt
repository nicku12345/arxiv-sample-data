In this short notes we propose a new notion of contractibility for coloured \omega-operad defined in the article published in Cahiers de Topologie et de G{\'e}om{\'e}trie Diff{\'e}rentielle Cat{\'e}gorique (2011), volume 4. We propose also an other way to build the monad for free contractible coloured \omega-operads.
