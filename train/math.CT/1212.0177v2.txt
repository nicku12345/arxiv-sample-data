We consider the notions of the replicators, including the duplicator and triplicator, of a binary operad. As in the closely related notions of di-Var-algebra and tri-Var-algebra in [14], they provide a general operadic definition for the recent constructions of replicating the operations of algebraic structures. We show that taking replicators is in Koszul dual to taking successors in [3] for binary quadratic operads and is equivalent to taking the white product with certain operads such as Perm. We also relate the replicators to the actions of average operators.
