We construct new complete cotorsion pairs in the categories of modules and chain complexes over a Gorenstein ring R, from the notions of Gorenstein homological dimensions, in order to obtain new Abelian model structures on both categories. If r is a positive integer, we show that the class of modules with Gorenstein-projective (or Gorenstein-flat) dimension \leq r forms the left half of a complete cotorsion pair. Analogous results also hold for chain complexes over R. In any Gorenstein category, we prove that the class of objects with Gorenstein-injective dimension \leq r is the right half of a complete cotorsion pair. The method we use in each case consists in constructing a cogenerating set for each pair. Later on, we give some applications of these results. First, as an extension of some results by M. Hovey and J. Gillespie, we establish a bijective correspondence between the class of differential graded r-projective complexes and the class of modules over R[x] / (x^2) with Gorenstein-projective dimension \leq r, provided R is left and right Noetherian with finite global dimension. The same correspondence is also valid for the (Gorenstein-)injective and (Gorenstein-)flat dimensions.
