In this paper we introduce the notion of a 'generalised' co-slicing of a triangulated category. This generalises the theory of co-stability conditions in a manner analogous to the way in which Gorodentsev, Kuleshov and Rudakov's t-stabilities generalise Bridgeland's theory of stability conditions. As an application of this notion, we use a complete classification of 'generalised' co-slicings in the bounded derived category of the Kronecker algebra, D^b(KQ), to obtain a classification of co-t-structures in D^b(Q). This is then used to compute the co-stability manifold of D^b(KQ).
