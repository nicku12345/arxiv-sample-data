We classify compactly generated co-t-structures on the derived category of a commutative noetherian ring. In order to accomplish that, we develop a theory for compactly generated Hom-orthogonal pairs (also known as torsion pairs in the literature) in triangulated categories that resembles Bousfield localization theory. Finally, we show that the category of perfect complexes over a connected commutative noetherian ring admits only the trivial co-t-structures and (de)suspensions of the canonical co-t-structure and use this to describe all silting objects in the category.
