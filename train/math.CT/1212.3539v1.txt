Brugui\`eres, Lack and Virelizier have recently obtained a vast generalization of Sweedler's Fundamental Theorem of Hopf modules, in which the role of the Hopf algebra is played by a bimonad. We present an extension of this result which involves, in addition to the bimonad, a comodule-monad and a algebra-comonoid over it. As an application we obtain a generalization of another classical theorem from the Hopf algebra literature, due to Schneider, which itself is an extension of Sweedler's result (to the setting of Hopf Galois extensions).
