We build an infinite dimensional scheme parametrizing isomorphism classes of coherent quotients of a quasi-coherent sheaf on a projective scheme. The main tool to achieve the construction is a version of Grothendieck's Grassmannian embedding combined with a result of Deligne, realizing quasi-coherent sheaves as ind-objects in the category of quasi-coherent sheaves of finite presentation. We end our treatment with the discussion of a special case in which we can retain an analog of the Grassmannian embedding.
