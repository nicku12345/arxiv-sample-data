This is the author's Ph.D. Thesis. It contains results from four years of research into realizability and categorical logic. The main subjects are the axiomatisation of realizable propositions, and a characterization of realizability categories as pseudoinitial objects.   Realizability is a collection of techniques in the study of constructive logic. Some forms of realizability induce realizability categories, which are Heyting categories and therefore have a first order intuitionistic logic as internal language. The axiomatisation chapter of the thesis explains how and to what extend we can axiomatise the set of valid propositions in this internal language. The realizability categories chapter explains how to find regular functors from realizability categories into other categories.
