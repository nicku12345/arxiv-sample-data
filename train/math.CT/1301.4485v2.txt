In the context of a well generated tensor triangulated category, Section 3 investigates the relationship between the Bousfield lattice of a quotient and quotients of the Bousfield lattice. In Section 4 we develop a general framework to study the Bousfield lattice of the derived category of a commutative or graded-commutative ring, using derived functors induced by extension of scalars. Section 5 applies this work to extend results of Dwyer and Palmieri [DP08] to new non-Noetherian rings.
