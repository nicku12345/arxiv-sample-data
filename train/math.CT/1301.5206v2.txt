Our aim is to give a fairly complete account on the construction of compatible model structures on exact categories and symmetric monoidal exact categories, in some cases generalizing previously known results. We describe the close connection of this theory to approximation theory and cotorsion pairs. We also discuss the motivating applications with the emphasis on constructing monoidal model structures for the derived category of quasi-coherent sheaves of modules over a scheme.
