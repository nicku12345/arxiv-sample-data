We develop the theory of distributive inverse semigroups as the analogue of distributive lattices without top element and prove that they are in a duality with those etale groupoids having a spectral space of identities, where our spectral spaces are not necessarily compact. We prove that Boolean inverse semigroups can be characterized as those distributive inverse semigroups in which every prime filter is an ultrafilter; we also provide a topological characterization in terms of Hausdorffness. We extend the notion of the patch topology to distributive inverse semigroups and prove that every distributive inverse semigroup has a Booleanization. As applications of this result, we give a new interpretation of Paterson's universal groupoid of an inverse semigroup and by developing the theory of what we call tight coverages, we also provide a conceptual foundation for Exel's tight groupoid.
