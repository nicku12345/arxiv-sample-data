In this paper we introduce the notion of an operator category and two different models for homotopy theory of \infty-operads over an operator category -- one of which extends Lurie's theory of \infty-operads, the other of which is completely new, even in the commutative setting. We define perfect operator categories, and we describe a category \Lambda(\Phi) attached to a perfect operator category \Phi that provides Segal maps. We define a wreath product of operator categories and a form of the Boardman--Vogt tensor product that lies over it. We then give examples of operator categories that provide universal properties for the operads A_n and E_n (1\leq n\leq +\infty), as well as a collection of new examples.
