The fundamental bigroupoid of a topological space is one way of capturing its homotopy 2-type. When the space is semilocally 2-connected, one can lift the construction to a bigroupoid internal to the category of topological spaces, as Brown and Danesh-Naruie lifted the fundamental groupoid to a topological groupoid. For locally relatively contractible spaces the resulting topological bigroupoid is locally trivial in a way analogous to the case of the topologised fundamental groupoid.
