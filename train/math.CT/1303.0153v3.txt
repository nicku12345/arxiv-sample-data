A variant of the trace in a monoidal category is given in the setting of closed monoidal derivators, which is applicable to endomorphisms of fiberwise dualizable objects. Functoriality of this trace is established. As an application, an explicit formula for the trace of the homotopy colimit of endomorphisms over finite EI-categories is deduced. This result can be seen as a generalization of the additivity of traces in monoidal categories with a compatible triangulation.
