Let \mathcal{X} be a class of R-modules. In this paper, we investigate \;\mathcal{X}-(f.g.)injective ((f.g.)projective) and DG-\mathcal{X}-injective (projective) complexes which are generalizations of injective (projective) and DG-injective (projective) complexes. We prove that some known results can be extended to the class of \;\mathcal{X}-(f.g.)injective ((f.g.)projective) and DG-\mathcal{X}-injective (projective) complexes for this general settings.
