We study Morita rings \Lambda_{(\phi,\psi)}=\bigl({smallmatrix} A &_AN_B_BM_A & B {smallmatrix}\bigr) in the context of Artin algebras from various perspectives. First we study covariant finite, contravariant finite, and functorially finite subcategories of the module category of a Morita ring when the bimodule homomorphisms \phi and \psi are zero. Further we give bounds for the global dimension of a Morita ring \Lambda_{(0,0)}, regarded as an Artin algebra, in terms of the global dimensions of A and B in the case when both \phi and \psi are zero. We illustrate our bounds with some examples. Finally we investigate when a Morita ring is a Gorenstein Artin algebra and then we determine all the Gorenstein-projective modules over the Morita ring with A=N=M=B=\Lambda, where \Lambda is an Artin algebra.
