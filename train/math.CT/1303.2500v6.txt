We prove a version of the Deligne conjecture for n-fold monoidal abelian categories A over a field k of characteristic 0, assuming some compatibility and non-degeneracy conditions for A. The output of our construction is a weak Leinster (n,1)-algebra over k, a relaxed version of the concept of Leinster n-algebra in Alg(k). The difference between the Leinster original definition and our relaxed one is apparent when n>1, for n=1 both concepts coincide.   We believe that there exists a functor from weak Leinster (n,1)-algebras over k to C(E_{n+1},k)-algebras, well-defined when k=\mathbb{Q}, and preserving weak equivalences. For the case n=1 such a functor is constructed in [Sh4] by elementary simplicial methods, providing (together with this paper) a complete solution for 1-monoidal abelian categories.   Our approach to Deligne conjecture is divided into two parts. The first part, completed in the present paper, provides a construction of a weak Leinster (n,1)-algebra over k, out of an n-fold monoidal k-linear abelian category (provided the compatibility and non-degeneracy condition are fulfilled). The second part (still open for n>1) is a passage from weak Leinster (n,1)-algebras to C(E_{n+1},k)-algebras.   As an application, we prove that the Gerstenhaber-Schack complex of a Hopf algebra over a field k of characteristic 0 admits a structure of a weak Leinster (2,1)-algebra over k extending the Yoneda structure. It relies on our earlier construction [Sh1] of a 2-fold monoidal structure on the abelian category of tetramodules over a bialgebra.
