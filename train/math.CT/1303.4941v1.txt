Pridham has shown that any Artin n-stack M has a presentation as a simplicial scheme X satisfying certain smoothness properties originally introduced by Grothendieck. In the previous paper we introduced an Artin n-stack M of Maurer-Cartan elements of a dg-category and constructed a chart, and have already proven the first conditions of smoothness of X_1\rightarrow X_0 explicitly. In this paper, we will construct explicitly the full simplicial scheme and show the Grothendieck-Pridham smoothness conditions, implying that M is a geometric n-stack.
