We study autoequivalences of the derived category of coherent sheaves of a variety arising from a variation of GIT quotient. We show that these automorphisms are spherical twists, and describe how they result from mutations of semiorthogonal decompositions. Beyond the GIT setting, we show that all spherical twist autoequivalences of a dg-category can be obtained from mutation in this manner.   Motivated by a prediction from mirror symmetry, we refine the recent notion of "grade restriction rules" in equivariant derived categories. We produce additional derived autoequivalences of a GIT quotient and propose an interpretation in terms of monodromy of the quantum connection. We generalize this observation by proving a criterion under which a spherical twist autoequivalence factors into a composition of other spherical twists.
