We introduce a ramified covering of small categories, and we show three properties of the notion: the Riemann-Hurwitz formula holds for a ramified covering of finite categories, the zeta function of C divides that of \widetilde{C} for a ramified covering \map{P}{\widetilde{C}}{C} of finite categories, and the classifying space of a d-fold ramified covering of small categories is also a d-fold ramified covering in the sense of Dold \cite{Dol86}.
