We show that every small homotopy functor from spectra to spectra is weakly equivalent to a filtered colimit of representable functors represented in cofibrant spectra. Moreover, we present this classification as a Quillen equivalence of the category of small functors from spectra to spectra equipped with the homotopy model structure and the opposite of the pro-category of spectra with the strict model structure.
