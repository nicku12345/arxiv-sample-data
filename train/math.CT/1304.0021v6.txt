In the first part of our paper (Sections 1, 2 and 3) we reprove results of B. Plotkin, G. Zhitomirski. On automorphisms of categories of free algebras of some varieties, Journal of Algebra, 306:2, (2006), 344 -- 367 for the case of many-sorted algebras. In the second part of our paper (Section 4) we apply the results of the first part to the universal algebraic geometry of many-sorted algebras and refine and reprove results of B. Plotkin, Algebras with the same (algebraic) geometry, Proceedings of the International Conference on Mathematical Logic, Algebra and Set Theory, dedicated to 100 anniversary of P.S. Novikov, Proceedings of the Steklov Institute of Mathematics, MIAN, 242 (2003), 127 -- 207 and A. Tsurkov, Automorphic equivalence of algebras, International Journal of Algebra and Computation. 17:5/6, (2007), 1263 -- 1271 for these algebras. In the third part of this paper (Section 5) we consider some varieties of many-sorted algebras. We prove that automorphic equivalence coincide with geometric equivalence in the variety of the all actions of semigroups over sets and in the variety of the all automatons. We also consider the variety of the all representations of groups and the all representations of Lie algebras. For both these varieties we give an examples of the representations which are automorphically equivalent but not geometrically equivalent.
