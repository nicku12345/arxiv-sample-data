We establish a correspondence between recollements of abelian categories up to equivalence and certain TTF-triples. For a module category we show, moreover, a correspondence with idempotent ideals, recovering a theorem of Jans. Furthermore, we show that a recollement whose terms are module categories is equivalent to one induced by an idempotent element, thus answering a question by Kuhn.
