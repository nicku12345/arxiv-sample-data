In this paper we demonstrate that 'non-commutative localizations' of arbitrary additive categories (generalizing those defined by Cohn for rings) are closely (and naturally) related with weight structures. Localizing an arbitrary triangulated C by a set S of morphisms in the heart of a weight structure w for it one obtains a triangulated category endowed with a weight structure w'. The heart of w' is a certain idempotent completion of the non-commutative localization of the heart of w by S. The latter is the natural categorical version of Cohn's localizations of rings i.e. the functor connecting hearts is universal among all the additive functors that make the elements of S invertible. In particular, taking C=K^b(A) for an additive A we obtain a very efficient tool for computing the additive localization of A by S; using it, we generalize the calculations of Gerasimov and Malcolmson.   We apply our results to certain categories of birational motives over a base scheme U (generalizing those defined by Kahn and Sujatha). When U is the spectrum of a perfect field, the weight structure obtained is compatible with the Chow and Gersten weight structures defined by the first author in previous papers. For a general U the result is completely new.   We also consider the relation of weight structures with their adjacent t-structures (in localizations). In the 'motivic' setting mentioned this yields the natural generalization of the 'duality' between birational motives and birational sheaves with transfers established by Kahn and Sujatha.
