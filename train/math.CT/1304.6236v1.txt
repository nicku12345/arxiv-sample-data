We show that the category of mixed Hodge complexes admits a Cartan-Eilenberg structure, a notion introduced in [GNPR10] leading to a good calculation of the homotopy category in terms of (co)fibrant objects. This result provides a conceptual framework from which Beilinson's [Bei86] and Carlson's [Car80] results on mixed Hodge complexes and extensions of mixed Hodge structures follow easily.
