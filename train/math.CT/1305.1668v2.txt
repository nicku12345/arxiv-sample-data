Local cohomology functors are constructed for the category of cohomological functors on an essentially small triangulated category T equipped with an action of a commutative noetherian ring. This is used to establish a local-global principle and to develop a notion of stratification, for T and the cohomological functors on it, analogous to such concepts for compactly generated triangulated categories.
