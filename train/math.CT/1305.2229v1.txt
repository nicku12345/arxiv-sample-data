Modular categories are important algebraic structures in a variety of subjects in mathematics and physics. We provide an explicit, motivated and elementary definition of a modular category over a field of characteristic 0 as an equivalence class of solutions to a set of polynomial equations. We conclude that within each class of solutions, there is one which consists entirely of algebraic numbers. These algebraic solutions make it possible to discuss defining algebraic number fields of modular categories and their Galois twists. One motivation for such a definition is an arithmetic theory of modular categories which plays an important role in their classification. Another is to facilitate implementation of computer-based tools to resolve computational and classification problems intractible by other means. We observe some basic properties of Galois twists of modular categories and make conjectures about their relation to the the intrinsic data of modular categories.
