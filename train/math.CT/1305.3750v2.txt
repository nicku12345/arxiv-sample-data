Small B\'{e}nabou's bicategories and, in particular, Mac Lane's monoidal categories, have well-understood classifying spaces, which give geometric meaning to their cells. This paper contains some contributions to the study of the relationship between bicategories and the homotopy types of their classifying spaces. Mainly, generalizations are given of Quillen's Theorems A and B to lax functors between bicategories.
