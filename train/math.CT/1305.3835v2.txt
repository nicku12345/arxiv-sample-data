Homotopy Type Theory may be seen as an internal language for the \infty-category of weak \infty-groupoids which in particular models the univalence axiom. Voevodsky proposes this language for weak \infty-groupoids as a new foundation for mathematics called the Univalent Foundations of Mathematics. It includes the sets as weak \infty-groupoids with contractible connected components, and thereby it includes (much of) the traditional set theoretical foundations as a special case. We thus wonder whether those `discrete' groupoids do in fact form a (predicative) topos. More generally, homotopy type theory is conjectured to be the internal language of `elementary' \infty-toposes. We prove that sets in homotopy type theory form a \Pi W-pretopos. This is similar to the fact that the 0-truncation of an \infty-topos is a topos. We show that both a subobject classifier and a 0-object classifier are available for the type theoretical universe of sets. However, both of these are large and moreover, the 0-object classifier for sets is a function between 1-types (i.e. groupoids) rather than between sets. Assuming an impredicative propositional resizing rule we may render the subobject classifier small and then we actually obtain a topos of sets.
