We define a two-dimensional Contou-Carr\`{e}re symbol, which is a deformation of the two-dimensional tame symbol and is a natural generalization of the (usual) one-dimensional Contou-Carr\`{e}re symbol. We give several constructions of this symbol and investigate its properties. Using higher categorical methods, we prove reciprocity laws on algebraic surfaces for this symbol. We relate also the two-dimensional Contou-Carr\`{e}re symbol with the two-dimensional class field theory.
