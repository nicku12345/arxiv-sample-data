This paper establishes a uniform procedure to split the operations in any algebraic operad, generalizing previous known notions of splitting algebraic structures from the dendriform algebra of Loday that splits the associative operation to the successors that split any binary operad. Examples are provided for various n-associative algebras, n-Lie algebras, A_\infty algebras and L_\infty algebras. Further, the concept of a Rota-Baxter operator, first showing its importance in the associative and Lie algebra context and then generalized to any binary operads, is generalized to arbitrary operads. The classical links from the Rota-Baxter associative algebra to the dendriform algebra and its numerous generalizations are further generalized and unified as the link from the Rota-Baxter operator on an operad to the splitting of the operad. Finally, the remarkable fact that any dendriform algebra can be recovered from a relative Rota-Baxter operator is generalized to the context of operads with the generalized notion of a relative Rota-Baxter operator for any operad.
