The main objective of the paper is to define the construction of the object of monoids, over a monoidal category object in any 2-category with finite products, as a weighted limit. To simplify the definition of the weight, we use matrices of symmetric (possibly colored) operads that define some auxiliary categories and 2-categories. Systematic use of these matrices of operads allows us to define several similar objects as weighted limits. We show, among others, that the constructions of the object of bi-monoids over a symmetric monoidal category object or the object of actions of monoids along an action of a monoidal category object can be also described as weighted limits.
