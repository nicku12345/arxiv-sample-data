In order to study the problems of extending an action along a quotient of the acted object and along a quotient of the acting object, we investigate some properties of the fibration of points. In fact, we obtain a characterization of protomodular categories among quasi-pointed regular ones, and, in the semi-abelian case, a characterization of strong protomodular categories. Eventually, we return to the initial questions by stating the results in terms of internal actions.
