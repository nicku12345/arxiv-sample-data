In this paper, we consider deformations of Lie 2-algebras via the cohomology theory. We prove that a 1-parameter infinitesimal deformation of a Lie 2-algebra \g corresponds to a 2-cocycle of \g with the coefficients in the adjoint representation. The Nijenhuis operator for Lie 2-algebras is introduced to describe trivial deformations. We also study abelian extensions of Lie 2-algebras from the viewpoint of deformations of semidirect product Lie 2-algebras.
