We introduce and study a family of groups \mathbf{BB}_n, called the blocked-braid groups, which are quotients of Artin's braid groups \mathbf{B}_n, and have the corresponding symmetric groups \Sigma_n as quotients. They are defined by adding a certain class of geometrical modifications to braids. They arise in the study of commutative Frobenius algebras and tangle algebras in braided strict monoidal categories. A fundamental equation true in \mathbf{BB}_n is Dirac's Belt Trick; that torsion through 4\pi is equal to the identity. We show that \mathbf{BB}_n is finite for n=1,2 and 3 but infinite for n>3.
