In this paper, we prove that the bounded derived category D^b_{coh}(Y) of coherent sheaves on a separated scheme Y of finite type over a field \mathrm{k} of characteristic zero is homotopically finitely presented. This confirms a conjecture of Kontsevich. We actually prove a stronger statement: D^b_{coh}(Y) is equivalent to a DG quotient D^b_{coh}(\tilde{Y})/T, where \tilde{Y} is some smooth and proper variety, and the subcategory T is generated by a single object.   The proof uses categorical resolution of singularities of Kuznetsov and Lunts \cite{KL}, and a theorem of Orlov \cite{Or} stating that the class of geometric smooth and proper DG categories is stable under gluing.   We also prove the analogous result for \mathbb{Z}/2-graded DG categories of coherent matrix factorizations on such schemes. In this case instead of D^b_{coh}(\tilde{Y}) we have a semi-orthogonal gluing of a finite number of DG categories of matrix factorizations on smooth varieties, proper over \mathbb{A}_{\mathrm{k}}^1.
