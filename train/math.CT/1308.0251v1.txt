The definition of Azumaya algebras over commutative rings R require the tensor product of modules over R and the twist map for the tensor product of any two R-modules. Similar constructions are available in braided monoidal categories and Azumaya algebras were defined in these settings. Here we introduce Azumaya monads on any category \A by considering a monad \bF on \A endowed with a distributive law \lambda: FF\to FF satisfying the Yang-Baxter equation (BD-law). This allows to introduce an {\em opposite monad} \bF^\la and a monad structure on FF^\la. For an {\em Azumaya monad} we impose the condition that the canonical comparison functor induces an equivalence between the category \A and the category of \bF\bF^\la-modules. Properties and characterisations of these monads are studied, in particular for the case when F allows for a right adjoint functor. Dual to Azumaya monads we define {\em Azumaya comonads} and investigate the interplay between these notions.   In braided categories (\V,\ot,I,\tau), for any \V-algebra A, the braiding induces a BD-law \tau_{A,A}:A\ot A\to A\ot A and A is called left (right) Azumaya, provided the monad A\ot- (resp. -\ot A) is Azumaya. If \tau is a symmetry, or if the category \V admits equalisers and coequalisers, the notions of left and right Azumaya algebras coincide. The general theory provides the definition of coalgebras in \V. Given a cocommutative \V-coalgebra \bD, coalgebras \bC over \bD are defined as coalgebras in the monoidal category of \bD-comodules and we describe when these have the Azumaya property. In particular, over commutative rings R, a coalgebra C is Azumaya if and only if the dual R-algebra C^*=\Hom_R(C,R) is an Azumaya algebra.
