By a 2-group we mean a groupoid equipped with a weakened group structure. It is called split when it is equivalent to the semidirect product of a discrete 2-group and a one-object 2-group. By a permutation 2-group we mean the 2-group \mathbb{S}ym(\mathcal{G}) of self-equivalences of a groupoid \mathcal{G} and natural isomorphisms between them, with the product given by composition of self-equivalences. These generalize the symmetric groups \mathsf{S}_n, n\geq 1, obtained when \mathcal{G} is a finite discrete groupoid.   After introducing the wreath 2-product \mathsf{S}_n\wr\wr\ \mathbb{G} of the symmetric group \mathsf{S}_n with an arbitrary 2-group \mathbb{G}, it is shown that for any (finite type) groupoid \mathcal{G} the permutation 2-group \mathbb{S}ym(\mathcal{G}) is equivalent to a product of wreath 2-products of the form \mathsf{S}_n\wr\wr\ \mathbb{S}ym(\mathcal{B}\mathsf{G}), where \mathcal{B}\mathsf{G} is the delooping of \mathsf{G}. This is next used to compute the homotopy invariants of \mathbb{S}ym(\mathcal{G}) which classify it up to equivalence. In particular, we prove that \mathbb{S}ym(\mathcal{G}) can be non-split, and that the step from the trivial groupoid \mathcal{B}\mathsf{1} to an arbitrary one-object groupoid \mathcal{B}\mathsf{G} is in fact the only source of non-splitness. Various examples of permutation 2-groups are explicitly computed, in particular the permutation 2-group of the underlying groupoid of a (finite type) 2-group. It also follows from well known results about the symmetric groups that the permutation 2-group of the groupoid of all finite sets and bijections between them is equivalent to the direct product 2-group \mathbb{Z}_2[1]\times\mathbb{Z}_2[0], where \mathbb{Z}_2[0] and \mathbb{Z}_2[1] stand for the group \mathbb{Z}_2 thought of as a discrete and a one-object 2-group, respectively.
