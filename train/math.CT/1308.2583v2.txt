We discuss various concepts of \infty-homotopies, as well as the relations between them (focussing on the Leibniz type). In particular \infty-n-homotopies appear as the n-simplices of the nerve of a complete Lie {\infty}-algebra. In the nilpotent case, this nerve is known to be a Kan complex \cite{Get09}. We argue that there is a quasi-category of \infty-algebras and show that for truncated \infty-algebras, i.e. categorified algebras, this \infty-categorical structure projects to a strict 2-categorical one. The paper contains a shortcut to (\infty,1)-categories, as well as a review of Getzler's proof of the Kan property. We make the latter concrete by applying it to the 2-term \infty-algebra case, thus recovering the concept of homotopy of \cite{BC04}, as well as the corresponding composition rule \cite{SS07}. We also answer a question of \cite{BS07} about composition of \infty-homotopies of \infty-algebras.
