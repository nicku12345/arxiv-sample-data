We describe a comparison between pretriangulated differential graded categories and certain stable infinity categories. Specifically, we use a model category structure on differential graded categories over k (a field of characteristic 0) where the weak equivalences are the Morita equivalences, and where the fibrant objects are in particular pretriangulated differential graded categories. We show the underlying infinity category of this model category is equivalent to the infinity category of k-linear stable infinity categories.
