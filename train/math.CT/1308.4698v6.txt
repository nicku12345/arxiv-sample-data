We study finiteness properties, especially the noetherian property, the Krull dimension and a variation of finite presentation, in categories of polynomial functors from a small symmetric monoidal category whose unit is an initial object to an abelian category (notion introduced in this general setting in the work http://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00851869 joint with C. Vespa). We give also an application to functors related to automorphisms of free groups.
