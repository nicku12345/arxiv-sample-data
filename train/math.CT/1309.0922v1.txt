The author studied in \cite{shi} the covering map property of the local homeomorphism associating to the space of stability conditions over the n-Kronecker quiver. In this paper, we discuss the covering map property for stability conditions over the Dynkin quiver of type A_3. The local homeomorphism from a connected component of stability conditions over A_3 to 3-dimensional complex vector space becomes a covering map when we restrict it to the complement of six codimension one subspaces.
