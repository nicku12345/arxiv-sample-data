In this paper, we introduce the notion of the pivotal cover \mathcal{C}^{\mathsf{piv}} of a left rigid monoidal category \mathcal{C} to develop a theoretical foundation for the theory of Frobenius-Schur (FS) indicators in "non-pivotal" settings. For an object \mathbf{V} \in \mathcal{C}^{\mathsf{piv}}, the (n, r)-th FS indicator \nu_{n, r}(\mathbf{V}) is defined by generalizing that of an object of a pivotal monoidal category. This notion gives a categorical viewpoint to some recent results on generalizations of FS indicators.   Based on our framework, we also study the FS indicators of the "adjoint object" in a finite tensor category, which can be considered as a generalization of the adjoint representation of a Hopf algebra. The indicators of this object closely relate to the space of endomorphisms of the iterated tensor product functor.
