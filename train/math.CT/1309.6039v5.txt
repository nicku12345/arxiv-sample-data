We study the homotopy category \mathsf{K}_{N}(\mathcal{B}) of N-complexes of an additive category \mathcal{B} and the derived category \mathsf{D}_{N}(\mathcal{A}) of an abelian category \mathcal{A}. First we show that both \mathsf{K}_N(\mathcal{B}) and \mathsf{D}_N(\mathcal{A}) have natural structures of triangulated categories. Then we establish a theory of projective (resp., injective) resolutions and derived functors. Finally, under some conditions of an abelian category \mathcal{A}, we show that \mathsf{D}_{N}(\mathcal{A}) is triangle equivalent to the ordinary derived category \mathsf{D}(\mathsf{Morph}_{N-2}(\mathcal{A})) where \mathsf{Morph}_{N-2}(\mathcal{A}) is the category of sequential N-2 morphisms of \mathcal{A}.
