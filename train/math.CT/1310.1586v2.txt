We develop the theory of 2-quivers and quiver 2-categories to run in parallel with the classical theory of quiver algebras. A quiver 2-category is always finitary, and, conversely, every finitary 2-category will be bi-equivalent with a quiver 2-category for a unique underlying reduced 2-quiver.   As an application, we produce an example of a fiat 2-category, one of whose Duflo involutions is not self-adjoint.
