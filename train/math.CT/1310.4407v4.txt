We study tensor structures on (Rep G)-module categories defined by actions of a compact quantum group G on unital C*-algebras. We show that having a tensor product which defines the module structure is equivalent to enriching the action of G to the structure of a braided-commutative Yetter-Drinfeld algebra. This shows that the category of braided-commutative Yetter-Drinfeld G-C*-algebras is equivalent to the category of generating unitary tensor functors from Rep G into C*-tensor categories. To illustrate this equivalence, we discuss coideals of quotient type in C(G), Hopf-Galois extensions and noncommutative Poisson boundaries.
