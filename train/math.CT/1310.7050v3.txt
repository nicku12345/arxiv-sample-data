We prove a rank-finiteness conjecture for modular categories: up to equivalence, there are only finitely many modular categories of any fixed rank. Our technical advance is a generalization of the Cauchy theorem in group theory to the context of spherical fusion categories. For a modular category \mathcal{C} with N=ord(T), the order of the modular T-matrix, the Cauchy theorem says that the set of primes dividing the global quantum dimension D^2 in the Dedekind domain \mathbb{Z}[e^{\frac{2\pi i}{N}}] is identical to that of N.
