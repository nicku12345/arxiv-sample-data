This article is the continuation of [LS12]. We use categories of matrix factorizations to define a morphism of rings (= a Landau-Ginzburg motivic measure) from the (motivic) Grothendieck ring of varieties over \mathbb{A}^1 to the Grothendieck ring of saturated dg categories (with relations coming from semi-orthogonal decompositions into admissible subcategories). Our Landau-Ginzburg motivic measure is the analog for matrix factorizations of the motivic measure in [BLL04] whose definition involved bounded derived categories of coherent sheaves. On the way we prove smoothness and a Thom-Sebastiani theorem for enhancements of categories of matrix factorizations.
