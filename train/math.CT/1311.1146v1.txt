Topological algebras have properties that extend naturally to those of topological groups [8, 9], but is it the case that semi-direct products exist as in the category of groups? Firstly, we express concepts in categorical language that capture group properties. We then observe the results about topological groups now extended to varieties of topological algebras. We conclude showing that for topological algebras obeying certain axioms, there exist semi-direct products which we caracterize like in [17].
