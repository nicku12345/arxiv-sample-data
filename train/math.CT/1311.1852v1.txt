We introduce some classes of genuine higher categories in homotopy type theory, defined as well-behaved subcategories of the category of types. We give several examples, and some techniques for showing other things are not examples. While only a small part of what is needed, it is a natural construction, and may be instructive for people seeking to provide a fully general construction.
