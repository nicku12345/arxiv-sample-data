Generalized multicategories, also called T-monoids, are well known class of mathematical structures, which include diverse set of examples. In this paper we construct a generalization of the adjunction between strict monoidal categories and multicategories, where the latter are replaced by T-monoids. To do this we introduce lax monads in a 3-category, and establish their relationship with equipments, which are bicategory like structures appropriate for the generalized multicategory theory.
