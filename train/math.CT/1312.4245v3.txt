In the present article, we describe constructions of model structures on general bicomplete categories. We are motivated by the following question: given a category \mathcal{C} with a subcategory w\mathcal{C} closed under retracts, when is there a model structure on \mathcal{C} with w\mathcal{C} as the subcategory of weak equivalences? We begin exploring this question in the case where w\mathcal{C} = F^{-1}(\mathrm{iso}\, \mathcal{D}) for some functor F:\mathcal{C}\rightarrow \mathcal{D}. We also prove properness of our constructions under minor assumptions and examine an application to the category of infinite graphs.
