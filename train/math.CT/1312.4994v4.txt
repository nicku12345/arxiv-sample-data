We study the (\infty, 1)-category of autoequivalences of \infty-operads. Using techniques introduced by To\"en, Lurie, and Barwick and Schommer-Pries, we prove that this (\infty, 1)-category is a contractible \infty-groupoid. Our calculation is based on the model of complete dendroidal Segal spaces introduced by Cisinski and Moerdijk. Similarly, we prove that the (\infty, 1)-category of autoequivalences of non-symmetric \infty-operads is the discrete monoidal category associated to Z/2Z. We also include a computation of the (\infty, 1)-category of autoequivalences of (\infty, n)-categories based on Rezk's \Theta_n-spaces.
