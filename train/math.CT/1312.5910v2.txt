We give a definition of an operad with general groups of equivariance suitable for use in any symmetric monoidal category with appropriate colimits. We then apply this notion to study the 2-category of algebras over an operad in Cat. We show that any operad is finitary, that an operad is cartesian if and only if the group actions are nearly free (in a precise fashion), and that the existence of a pseudo-commutative structure largely depends on the groups of equivariance. We conclude by showing that the operad for strict braided monoidal categories has two canonical pseudo-commutative structures.
