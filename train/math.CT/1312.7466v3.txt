We describe the group of braided tensor autoequivalences of the Drinfeld centre of a finite group G isomorphic to the identity functor (just as a functor) as a semi-direct product Aut^1_{br}(\Z(G))\ \simeq\ Out_{2-cl}(G)\ltimes B(G)\  of the group of double class preserving automorphisms and the Bogomolov multiplier of G. The Bogomolov multiplier B(G) is the subgroup of its Schur multiplier H^2(G,k^*) of classes vanishing on abelian subgroups of G. We show that elements of Aut^1_{br}(\Z(G)) give rise to different realisations of the charge conjugation modular invariant for G-orbifolds of holomorphic conformal field theories.
