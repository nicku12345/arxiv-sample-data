This paper is a sequel to "Logical systems I: Lambda calculi through discreteness". It provides a general 2-categorical setting for extensional calculi and shows how intensional and extensional calculi can be related in logical systems. We define Yoneda triangles as relativisations of internal adjunctions, and use them to characterise universes that admit a notion of convolution. We show that such universes induce semantics for lambda calculi. We prove that a construction analogical to enriched Day convolution works for categories internal to a locally cartesian closed category with finite colimits.
