Let (1) be an automorphism on an additive category \mathcal{B}, and let \eta\colon (1)\to {\rm Id}_{\mathcal{B}} be a natural transformation satisfying \eta_{X(1)}=\eta_X(1) for any object X in \mathcal{B}. We construct a new Frobenius exact structure on the category of complexes in \mathcal{B}, which is associated to the natural transformation \eta. As a consequence, the category introduced in Definition 2.4 of [J. Rickard, Morita theory for derived categories, J. London Math. Soc. 39(1989), 436-456] has a Frobenius exact structure.
