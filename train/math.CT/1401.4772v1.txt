In this paper, we give an accessible introduction to the theory of orbispaces via groupoids. We define a certain class of topological groupoids, which we call orbigroupoids. Each orbigroupoid represents an orbispace, but just as with orbifolds and Lie groupoids, this representation is not unique: orbispaces are Morita equivalence classes of orbigroupoids. We show how to formalize this equivalence by defining the category of orbispaces as a bicatecory of fractions from the category of orbigroupoids. We focus particularly on laying the groundwork for future work in creating mapping objects for orbispaces which are themselves orbispaces, and providing a concrete description of how this mapping space construction will get its orbispace structure. Throughout this paper, we illustrate our definitions and results with numerous examples which we hope will be useful in seeing how the categorical point of view is used to study these spaces.
