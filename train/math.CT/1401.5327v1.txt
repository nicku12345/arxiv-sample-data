This survey presents in some detail the main advances that have been recently taking place in Computational Linguistics towards the unification of the two prominent semantic paradigms: the compositional formal semantics view and the distributional models of meaning based on vector spaces. After an introduction to these two approaches, I review the most important models that aim to provide compositionality in distributional semantics. Then I proceed and present in more detail a particular framework by Coecke, Sadrzadeh and Clark (2010) based on the abstract mathematical setting of category theory, as a more complete example capable to demonstrate the diversity of techniques and scientific disciplines that this kind of research can draw from. This paper concludes with a discussion about important open issues that need to be addressed by the researchers in the future.
