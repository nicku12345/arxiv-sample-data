We show that certain tilting results for quivers are formal consequences of stability, and as such are part of a formal calculus available in any abstract stable homotopy theory. Thus these results are for example valid over arbitrary ground rings, for quasi-coherent modules on schemes, in the differential-graded context, in stable homotopy theory and also in the equivariant, motivic or parametrized variant thereof. In further work, we will continue developing this calculus and obtain additional abstract tilting results. Here, we also deduce an additional characterization of stability, based on Goodwillie's strongly (co)cartesian n-cubes.   As applications we construct abstract Auslander-Reiten translations and abstract Serre functors for the trivalent source and verify the relative fractionally Calabi-Yau property. This is used to offer a new perspective on May's axioms for monoidal, triangulated categories.
