We seize the opportunity of the publication of selected papers from the \emph{Logic, categories, semantics} workshop in the \emph{Journal of Applied Logic} to survey some current trends in logic, namely intuitionistic and linear type theories, that interweave categorical, geometrical and computational considerations. We thereafter present how these rich logical frameworks can model the way language conveys meaning.
