We study the monoidal closed category of symmetric multicategories, especially in relation with its cartesian structure and with sequential multicategories (whose arrows are sequences of concurrent arrows in a given category). Then we consider cartesian multicategories in a similar perspective and develop some peculiar items such as algebraic products. Several classical facts arise as a consequence of this analysis when some of the multicategories involved are representable.
