We describe the category of homotopy coalgebras, concentrating on properties of relatively cofree homotopy coalgebras, morphisms and coderivations from an ordinary coalgebra to a relatively cofree homotopy coalgebra, morphisms and coderivations between coalgebras of latter type. Cobar- and bar-constructions between counit-complemented curved coalgebras, unit-complemented curved algebras and curved homotopy coalgebras are described. Using twisting cochains an adjunction between cobar- and bar-constructions is derived under additional assumptions.
