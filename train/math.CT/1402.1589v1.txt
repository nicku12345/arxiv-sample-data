Given a compact space in a fixed universe of set theory, one can naturally define its interpretation in any ZFC extension of the universe. We investigate the stability of some classes of compact spaces with respect to extensions of this sort. We show that the class of Eberlein/Gul'ko compacta is stable (= absolute). On the other hand, there are examples of Corson compacta which are no longer Corson in some forcing extensions.   All the material comes from the author's notes written between 2004 -- 2006.
