We study the role of the Serre functor in the theory of derived equivalences. Let \mathcal{A} be an abelian category and let (\mathcal{U}, \mathcal{V}) be a t-structure on the bounded derived category D^b \mathcal{A} with heart \mathcal{H}. We investigate when the natural embedding \mathcal{H} \to D^b \mathcal{A} can be extended to a triangle equivalence D^b \mathcal{H} \to D^b \mathcal{A}. Our focus of study is the case where \mathcal{A} is the category of finite-dimensional modules over a finite-dimensional hereditary algebra. In this case, we prove that such an extension exists if and only if the t-structure is bounded and the aisle \mathcal{U} of the t-structure is closed under the Serre functor.
