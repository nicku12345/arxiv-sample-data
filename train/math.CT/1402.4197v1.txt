The notion of a duality between two derived functors as well as an extension theorem for derived functors to larger categories in which they need not be defined is introduced. These ideas are then applied to extend and study the coext functors to an arbitrary coalgebra. A new homology theory theory is then built therefrom and is shown to exhibit certain duality relations to the Hochschild cohomology of certain coalgebras. Lastly, a certain exceptional type of coalgebra is introduced and it is used to make explicit connections between this new homology theory and the continuous cohomology of this exceptional algebra's pro-finite dual algebra.
