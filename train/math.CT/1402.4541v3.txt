The bicategory \mathcal{LG} of Landau-Ginzburg models has polynomials as objects and matrix factorisations as 1-morphisms. The composition of these 1-morphisms produces infinite rank matrix factorisations, which is a nuisance. In this paper we define a bicategory which is equivalent to \mathcal{LG} in which composition of 1-morphisms produces finite rank matrix factorisations equipped with the action of a Clifford algebra. This amounts to a finite model of composition in \mathcal{LG}.
