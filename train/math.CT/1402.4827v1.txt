Extendability of an empirical model was shown by Abramsky & Brandenburger to correspond in a unified manner to both locality and non-contextuality. We develop their approach by presenting a refinement of the notion of extendability that can also be useful in characterising the properties of sub-models. The refinement is found to have another useful application: it is shown that a particular canonical extension, when well-defined, may be used for the construction of Bell-type models from models of more general kinds in such a way that the constructed model is equivalent to the original in terms of non-locality/contextuality. This is important since on practical and foundational levels, the notion of locality in Bell-type models can more easily be motivated than the corresponding general notion of contextuality. We consider examples of Bell-type models generated from some standard examples of contextual models, including an entire class of Kochen-Specker-like models. This exposes an intriguing relationship between the simplest possible contextual model (the contextual triangle) and Popescu-Rohrlich no-signalling correlations.
