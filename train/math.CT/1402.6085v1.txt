The Baues--Wirsching cohomology is one of the cohomologies of a small category. Our aim is to describe the first Baues--Wirsching cohomology of the small category generated by a finite quiver freely. We consider the case where the coefficient is a natural system obtained by the composition of a functor and the target functor. We give an algorithm to obtain generators of the vector space of inner derivations. It is known that there exists a surjection from the vector space of derivations of the small category to the first Baues--Wirsching cohomology whose kernel is the vector space of inner derivations.
