Pronk's theorem on bicategories of fractions is applied, in almost all cases in the literature, to 2-categories of geometrically presentable stacks on a 1-site. We give an proof that subsumes all previous such results and which is purely 2-categorical in nature, ignoring the nature of the objects involved. The proof holds for 2-categories that are not (2,1)-categories, and we give conditions for local essential smallness.
