In this paper we discuss different properties of noncommutative schemes over a field. We define a noncommutative scheme as a differential graded category of a special type. We study regularity, smoothness and properness for noncommutative schemes. Admissible subcategories of categories of perfect complexes on smooth projective schemes provide natural examples of smooth and proper noncommutative schemes that are called geometric noncommutative schemes. In this paper we show that the world of all geometric noncommutative schemes is closed under an operation of a gluing of differential graded categories via bimodules. As a consequence of the main theorem we obtain that for any finite dimensional algebra with separable semisimple part the category of perfect complexes over it is equivalent to a full subcategory of the category of perfect complexes on a smooth projective scheme. Moreover, if the algebra has finite global dimension, then the full subcategory is admissible. We also provide a construction of a smooth projective scheme that admits a full exceptional collection and contains as a subcollection an exceptional collection given in advance. As another application of the main theorem we obtain, in characteristic 0, an existence of a full embedding for the category of perfect complexes on any proper scheme to the category of perfect complexes on a smooth projective scheme.
