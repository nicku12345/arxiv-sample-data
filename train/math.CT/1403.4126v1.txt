Jean-Louis Loday has defined generalised bialgebras and proved structure theorems in this setting which can be seen as general forms of the Poincar\'e-Birkhoff-Witt and the Cartier-Milnor-Moore theorems. It was observed by the present authors that parts of the theory of generalised bialgebras are special cases of results on entwined monads and comonads and the corresponding mixed bimodules. In this article the Rigidity Theorem of Loday is extended to this more general categorical framework.
