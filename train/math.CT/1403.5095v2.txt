As shown by S. Eilenberg and J.C. Moore (1965), for a monad F with right adjoint comonad G on any catgeory \mathbb{A}, the category of unital F-modules \mathbb{A}_F is isomorphic to the category of counital G-comodules \mathbb{A}^G. The monad F is Frobenius provided we have F=G and then \mathbb{A}_F\simeq \mathbb{A}^F. Here we investigate which kind of equivalences can be obtained for non-unital monads (and non-counital comonads).
