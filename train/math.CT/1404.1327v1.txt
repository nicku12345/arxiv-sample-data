We consider two categorifications of the cohomology of a topological space X by taking coefficients in the category of differential graded categories. We consider both derived global sections of a constant presheaf and singular cohomology and find the resulting dg-categories are quasi-equivalent and moreover quasi-equivalent to representations in perfect complexes of chains on the loop space of X.
