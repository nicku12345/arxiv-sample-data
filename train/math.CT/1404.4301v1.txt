The purpose of this note is to show that, if \mathcal{V} is a closed monoidal category, the following three notions are equivalent.   (1) Category with \mathcal{V}-structure and cylinder.   (2) Tensored \mathcal{V}-category.   (3) Tensor-closed \mathcal{V}-module.   As an application we will show that, if \mathcal{V} is closed and symmetric, then given a category \mathcal{S} there is an one-to-one correspondence between the set of \mathcal{V}-structures with cylinder and path on \mathcal{S} introduced by Quillen and the set of closed \mathcal{V}-module structures on \mathcal{S} introduced by Hovey.
