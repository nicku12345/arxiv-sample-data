The major concern in the study of categories of logics is to describe condition for preservation, under the a method of combination of logics, of meta-logical properties. Our complementary approach to this field is study the "global" aspects of categories of logics in the vein of the categories \Ss, \Ls, \cA_s studied in \cite{AFLM3}. All these categories have good properties however the category of logics \cL does not allow a good treatment of the "identity problem" for logics (\cite{Bez}): for instance, the presentations of "classical logics" (e.g., in the signature \{\neg, \vee\} and \{\neg',\rightarrow'\}) are not \Ls-isomorphic. In this work, we sketch a possible way to overcome this "defect" (and anothers) by a mathematical device: a representation theory of logics obtained from category theoretic aspects on (Blok-Pigozzi) algebraizable logics. In this setting we propose the study of (left and right) "Morita equivalence" of logics and variants. We introduce the concepts of logics (left/right)-(stably) -Morita-equivalent and show that the presentations of classical logics are stably Morita equivalent but classical logics and intuitionist logics are not stably-Morita-equivalent: they are only stably-Morita-adjointly related.
