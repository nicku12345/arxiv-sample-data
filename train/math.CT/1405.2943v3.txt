In our previous paper we studied non-semistable exceptional objects in hereditary categories and introduced the notion of regularity preserving category, but we obtained quite a few examples of such categories. Certain conditions on the Ext-nontrivial couples (exceptional objects X,Y\in \mathcal A with {\rm Ext}^1(X,Y)\neq 0 and {\rm Ext}^1(Y,X)\neq 0) were shown to imply regularity-preserving. This paper is a brief review of the previous paper (with emphasis on regularity preserving property) and we add some remarks and conjectures.   It is known that in Dynkin quivers {\rm Hom}(\rho,\rho')=0 or {\rm Ext}^1(\rho,\rho')=0 for any two exceptional representations. In the present paper we use this property to show that for any Dynkin quiver Q there are no Ext-nontrivial couples in Rep_k(Q), which implies regularity preserving of Rep_k(Q), where k is an algebraically closed field. We study this property in other quivers. In particular in any star quiver with three arms Q for any two exceptional representations \rho, \rho' we have {\rm Hom}(\rho,\rho')=0 or {\rm Ext}^1(\rho,\rho')=0 provided that \rho or \rho' is a thin representation. In the previous version we asserted falsely that this holds for any two exceptional representations (without imposing the restriction that one of them is thin) for extended Dynkin quivers \widetilde{\mathbb E}_6, \widetilde{\mathbb E}_7, \widetilde{\mathbb E}_8 .
