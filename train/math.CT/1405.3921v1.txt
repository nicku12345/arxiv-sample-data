We study the category of \mathbb{Z}-indexed sequences over an abelian category and certain generalized homology functors for this category of sequences which are indexed by positive integers a and b. By looking at the corresponding derived category, we show that there is an "optimal" subcategory of sequences for every choice of our generalized homology functors, namely, the category of N-complexes (sequences for which the differential d satisfies d^N = 0) where N = a + b. In this optimal case we show that our homology functors reduce to Kapranov's homology functors \operatorname{ker} d^a / \operatorname{im} d^b.
