We classify the prelocalizing subcategories of the category of quasi-coherent sheaves on a locally noetherian scheme. In order to give the classification, we introduce the notion of a local filter of subobjects of the structure sheaf. The essential part of the argument is given as results on a Grothendieck category with certain properties. We also classify the localizing subcategories, the closed subcategories, and the bilocalizing subcategories in terms of filters.
