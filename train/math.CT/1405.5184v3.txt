There exist cubical transition systems containing cubes having an arbitrarily large number of faces. A regular transition system is a cubical transition system such that each cube has the good number of faces. The categorical and homotopical results of regular transition systems are very similar to the ones of cubical ones. A complete combinatorial description of fibrant cubical and regular transition systems is given. One of the two appendices contains a general lemma of independant interest about the restriction of an adjunction to a full reflective subcategory.
