It is proved that an element r in the center of a coherent ring \Lambda annihilates \mathrm{Ext}^{n}_{\Lambda}(M,N), for some positive integer n and all finitely presented \Lambda-modules M and N, if and only if the bounded derived category of \Lambda is an extension of the subcategory consisting of complexes annihilated by r and those obtained as n-fold extensions of \Lambda. This has applications to finiteness of dimension of derived categories.
