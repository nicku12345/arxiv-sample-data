In a sufficiently rich category, such as a category of R-modules, and a given infinite cardinal \kappa, we examine classes \Cal H^\kappa_* of objects M, such that the following natural monomorphism is an isomorphism: \prod_{i\in I}}^{\kappa}\hbox{\rm Hom}\,(M, A_i)\cong \hbox{\rm Hom}\,(M, \prod_{i\in I}}^{\kappa} A_i), for every family of objects \{A_i, i\in I\} (\prod^\kappa denotes the subproduct of all the vectors with support <\kappa).
