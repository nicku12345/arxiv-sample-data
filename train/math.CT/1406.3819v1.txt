The best-known version of Shelah's celebrated singular cardinal compactness theorem states that if the cardinality of an abelian group is singular, and all its subgroups of lesser cardinality are free, then the group itself is free. The proof can be adapted to cover a number of analogous situations in the setting of non-abelian groups, modules, graph colorings, set transversals etc. We give a single, structural statement of singular compactness that covers all examples in the literature that we are aware of. A case of this formulation, singular compactness for cellular structures, is of special interest; it expresses a relative notion of freeness. The proof of our functorial formulation is motivated by a paper of Hodges, based on a talk of Shelah. The cellular formulation is new, and related to recent work in abstract homotopy theory.
