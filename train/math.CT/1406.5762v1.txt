Grothendieck develops the theory of pro-objects over a category \mathsf{C}. The fundamental property of the category \mathsf{Pro}(\mathsf{C}) is that there is an embedding \mathsf{C} \overset{c}{\longrightarrow} \mathsf{Pro}(\mathsf{C}), the category \mathsf{Pro}(\mathsf{C}) is closed under small cofiltered limits, and these limits are free in the sense that for any category \mathsf{E} closed under small cofiltered limits, pre-composition with c determines an equivalence of categories \mathcal{C}at(\mathsf{Pro}(\mathsf{C}),\,\mathsf{E})_+ \simeq \mathcal{C}at(\mathsf{C},\, \mathsf{E}), (where the "+" indicates the full subcategory of the functors preserving cofiltered limits). In this paper we develop a 2-dimensional theory of pro-objects. Given a 2-category \mathcal{C}, we define the 2-category 2\hbox{-}\mathcal{P}ro(\mathcal{C}) whose objects we call 2-pro-objects. We prove that 2\hbox{-}\mathcal{P}ro(\mathcal{C}) has all the expected basic properties adequately relativized to the 2-categorical setting, including the universal property corresponding to the one described above. We have at hand the results of \mathcal{C}at-enriched category theory, but our theory goes beyond the \mathcal{C}at-enriched case since we consider the non strict notion of pseudo-limit, which is usually that of practical interest.
