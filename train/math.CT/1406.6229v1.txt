In this paper we present a new way to construct the pro-category of a category. This new model is very convenient to work with in certain situations. We present a few applications of this new model, the most important of which solves an open problem of Isaksen [Isa] concerning the existence of functorial factorizations in what is known as the strict model structure on a pro-category. Additionally we explain and correct an error in one of the standard references on pro-categories.
