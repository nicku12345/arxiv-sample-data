Let W be a finite dimensional algebraic structure (e.g. an algebra) over a field K of characteristic zero. We study forms of W by using Deligne's Theory of symmetric monoidal categories. We construct a category \mathcal{C}_W, which gives rise to a subfield K_0\subseteq K, which we call the field of invariants of W. This field will be contained in any subfield of K over which W has a form. The category \mathcal{C}_W is a K_0-form of Rep_{\bar{K}}(Aut(W)), and we use it to construct a generic form \widetilde{W} over a commutative K_0 algebra B_W (so that forms of W are exactly the specializations of \widetilde{W}). This generalizes some generic constructions for central simple algebras and for H-comodule algebras. We give some concrete examples arising from associative algebras and H-comodule algebras. As an application, we also explain how can one use the construction to classify two-cocycles on some finite dimensional Hopf algebras.
