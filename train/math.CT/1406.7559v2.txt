We introduce new enhancements for the bounded derived category D^b(Coh(X)) of coherent sheaves on a suitable scheme X and for its subcategory Perf(X) of perfect complexes. They are used for translating Fourier-Mukai functors to functors between derived categories of dg algebras, for relating homological smoothness of Perf(X) to geometric smoothness of X, and for proving homological smoothness of D^b(Coh(X)). Moreover, we characterize properness of Perf(X) and D^b(Coh(X)) geometrically.
