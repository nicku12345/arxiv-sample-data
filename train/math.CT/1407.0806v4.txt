We are interested in the 3-Calabi-Yau categories \mathcal{D} arising from quivers with potential associated to a triangulated marked surface \mathbf{S} (without punctures). We prove that the spherical twist group ST of \mathcal{D} is isomorphic to a subgroup (generated by braid twists) of the mapping class group of the decorated marked surface \mathbf{S}_{\bigtriangleup}. Here \mathbf{S}_{\bigtriangleup} is the surface obtained from \mathbf{S} by decorating with a set of decorated points, where the number of points equals the number of triangles in any triangulations of \mathbf{S}. For instance, when \mathbf{S} is an annulus, the result implies the corresponding spaces of stability conditions on \mathcal{D} is contractible.
