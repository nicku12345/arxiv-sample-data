We introduce a class of inverse monoids that can be regarded as non-commutative generalizations of Boolean algebras. These inverse monoids are related to a class of \'etale topological groupoids, under a non-commutative generalization of classical Stone duality. Furthermore, and significantly for this paper, they arise naturally in the theory of dynamical systems as developed by Matui. We are thereby able to reinterpret a theorem of Matui on a class of \'etale groupoids, in the spirit of Rubin's theorem, as an equivalent theorem about a class of inverse monoids. The inverse monoids in question may be viewed as the countably infinite generalizations of finite symmetric inverse monoids. Their groups of units therefore generalize the finite symmetric groups and include amongst their number the Thompson groups G_{n,1}.
