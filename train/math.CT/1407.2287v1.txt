With every pca \mathcal{A} and subpca \mathcal{A}_\# we associate the nested realizability topos \mathsf{RT}(\mathcal{A},\mathcal{A}_\#) within which we identify a class of small maps \mathcal{S} giving rise to a model of intuitionistic set theory within \mathsf{RT}(\mathcal{A},\mathcal{A}_\#). For every subtopos \mathcal{E} of such a nested realizability topos we construct an induced class \mathcal{S_E} of small maps in \mathcal{E} giving rise to a model of intuitionistic set theory within \mathcal{E}. This covers relative realizability toposes, modified relative realizability toposes, the modified realizability topos and van den Berg's recent Herbrand topos.
