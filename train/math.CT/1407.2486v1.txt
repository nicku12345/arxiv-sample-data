Given a functor p:E \rightarrow B and an object e \in E , we define a \emph{displacement} of e along a morphism \varepsilon: p(e) \rightarrow b, as a map e \rightarrow \nabla_\varepsilon(e) satisfying a universal property analogue to that of a \emph{cocartesian lifting} (pushforward) \emph{\`a la} B\'enabou-Grothendieck-Street. There are many difficulties in geometry that come from the fact that forgetful functors such as p: Var(\mathbf{C}) \rightarrow Top  don't have displacements of objects along arbitrary maps. And this can be already seen abstractly, since the existence of a left adjoint to p, can be reduced to the existence of all displacements of the initial object. However some \emph{schematization functors} exist as approximations. In a broader context, if B is a model category and p is a right adjoint, then the right-induced model category on E exists if and only if all displacements along any trivial cofibration \varepsilon, are weak p-equivalences. In these notes we provide some categorical lemmas that will be necessary for future applications. The idea is to have a \emph{homotopy descent process} for \emph{elementary displacements} when p has a \emph{presentation} as a 2-pullback of a family \{p_i: E_i \rightarrow B\}_{i\in J}. When suitably applied it should lead to techniques similar to Mumford's GIT through homotopy theory (simplicial presheaves).
