Given a fusion category \mathcal{C} and an indecomposable \mathcal{C}-module category \mathcal{M}, the fusion category \mathcal{C}^*_\mathcal{M} of \mathcal{C}-module endofunctors of \mathcal{M} is called the (Morita) dual fusion category of \mathcal{C} with respect to \mathcal{M}. We describe tensor functors between two arbitrary duals \mathcal{C}^*_\mathcal{M} and \mathcal{D}^*_\mathcal{N} in terms of data associated to \mathcal{C} and \mathcal{D}. We apply the results to G-equivariantizations of fusion categories and group-theoretical fusion categories. We describe the orbits of the action of the Brauer-Picard group on the set of module categories and we propose a categorification of the Rosenberg-Zelinsky sequence for fusion categories.
