In this paper we introduce the notion of a categorical Mackey functor. This categorical notion allows us to obtain new Mackey functors by passing to Quillen's K-theory of the corresponding abelian categories. In the case of an action by monoidal autoequivalences on a monoidal category the Mackey functor obtained at the level of Grothendieck rings has in fact a Green functor structure.
