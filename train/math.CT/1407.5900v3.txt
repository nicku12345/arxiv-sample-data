In the first part of this paper we construct a model structure for the category of filtered cochain complexes of modules over some commutative ring R and explain how the classical Rees construction relates this to the usual projective model structure over cochain complexes. The second part of the paper is devoted to the study of derived moduli of sheaves: we give a new proof of the representability of the derived stack of perfect complexes over a proper scheme and then use the new model structure for filtered complexes to tackle moduli of filtered derived modules. As an application, we construct derived versions of Grassmannians and flag varieties.
