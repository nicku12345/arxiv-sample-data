We develop the theory of Griffiths period map, which relates the classification of smooth projective varieties to the associated Hodge structures, in the framework of Derived Algebraic Geometry. We complete the description of the local period map as a morphism of derived deformation functors, following the path marked by Fiorenza, Manetti and Martinengo. In the end we show how to lift the local period map to a (non-geometric) morphism of derived stacks, in order to construct a global version of that.
