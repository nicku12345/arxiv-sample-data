We study the gerbal representations of a finite group G or, equivalently, module categories over Ostrik's category Vec_G^\alpha for a 3-cocycle \alpha. We adapt Bartlett's string diagram formalism to this situation to prove that the categorical character of a gerbal representation is a module over the twisted Drinfeld double D^\alpha(G). We interpret this twisted Drinfeld double in terms of the inertia groupoid of a categorical group.
