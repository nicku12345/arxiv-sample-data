We introduce the category of generalized Courant algebroids and show that it admits a free object on any anchored vector bundle. The free Courant algebroid is built from two components: the generalized Courant algebroid associated to a symmetric Leibniz algebroid and the free symmetric Leibniz algebroid on an anchored vector bundle. Our construction is thus based on the new concept of symmetric Leibniz algebroid. We compare this subclass of Leibniz algebroids with the subclass of Loday algebroids that was introduced and studied in a previous paper of Grabowski, Khudaverdyan and Poncin.
