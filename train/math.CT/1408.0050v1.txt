Coalgebras generalize various kinds of dynamical systems occuring in mathematics and computer science. Examples of systems that can be modeled as coalgebras include automata and Markov chains. We will present a coalgebraic representation of systems occuring in the field of quantum computation, using convex sets of density matrices as state spaces. This will allow us to derive a method to convert quantum mechanical systems into simpler probabilistic systems with the same probabilistic behaviour.
