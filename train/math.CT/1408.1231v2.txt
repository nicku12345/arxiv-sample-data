We define a class of inverse monoids having the property that their lattices of principal ideals naturally form an MV-algebra. We say that an arbitrary MV-algebra can be co-ordinatized if it is isomorphic to one constructed in this way from such a monoid. We prove that every countable MV-algebra can be so co-ordinatized. The particular inverse monoids needed to establish this result are examples of what we term AF inverse monoids. These are constructed from Bratteli diagrams and arise naturally as direct limits of finite direct products of finite symmetric inverse monoids.
