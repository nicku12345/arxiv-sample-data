We extend some properties of pullbacks which are known to hold in a Mal'tsev context to the more general context of Gumm categories. The varieties of universal algebras which are Gumm categories are precisely the congruence modular ones. These properties lead to a simple alternative proof of the known property that central extensions and normal extensions coincide for any Galois structure associated with a Birkhoff subcategory of an exact Goursat category.
