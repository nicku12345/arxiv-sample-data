Let X^\bullet be a cosimplicial object in a pointed \infty-category. We show that the fiber of \mathrm{Tot}_m(X^\bullet) \to \mathrm{Tot}_n(X^\bullet) depends only on the pointed cosimplicial object \Omega^k X^\bullet and is in particular a k-fold loop object, where k = 2n - m+2. The approach is explicit obstruction theory with quasicategories. We also discuss generalizations to other types of homotopy limits and colimits.
