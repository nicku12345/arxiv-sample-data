For topological spaces X and Y, a (not necessarily continuous) function f:X \rightarrow Y naturally induces a functor from the category of closed subsets of X (with morphisms given by inclusions) to the category of closed subsets of Y. The function f also naturally induces a functor from the category of closed subsets of Y to the category of closed subsets of X. Our aim in this expository note is to show that the function f is continuous if and only if the first of the above two functors is a left adjoint to the second. We thereby obtain elementary examples of adjoint pairs (apparently) not part of the standard introductory treatments of this subject.
