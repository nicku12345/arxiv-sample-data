Let \mathcal C be closed symmetric monoidal Grothendieck category. We define the pure derived category with respect to the monoidal structure via a relative injective model category structure on the category \mathbf{C}(\mathcal C) of unbounded chain complexes in \mathcal C. We use \lambda-Purity techniques to get this. As application we define the stalkwise pure derived category of the category of quasi--coherent sheaves on a quasi-separated scheme. We also give a different approach by using the category of flat quasi--coherent sheaves.
