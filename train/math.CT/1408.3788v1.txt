We study the subgroup \mathcal{E}xt^i_{\mathcal{C}}(\mathcal{F}; C, D) of \mathcal{E}xt^i_{\mathcal{C}}(C,D) formed by those i-extensions of C by D in an Abelian category \mathcal{C} which are {\rm Hom}_{\mathcal{C}}(\mathcal{F},-)-exact, and present a Baer-like description of this subgroup in terms of certain right derived functors of {\rm Hom}_{\mathcal{C}}(-,-). We also study adjointness properties of these subgroups and the disk and sphere chain complex functors \mathcal{C} \longrightarrow \textbf{Ch}(\mathcal{C}), given by a collection of natural isomorphisms which generalize the corresponding adjointness properties proven by J. Gillespie for \mathcal{E}xt^i(-,-).
