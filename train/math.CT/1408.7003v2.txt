We characterize t-structures in stable \infty-categories as suitable quasicategorical factorization systems. More precisely we show that a t-structure \mathfrak{t} on a stable \infty-category \mathbf{C} is equivalent to a normal torsion theory \mathbb{F} on \mathbf{C}, i.e. to a factorization system \mathbb{F}=(\mathcal{E},\mathcal{M}) where both classes satisfy the 3-for-2 cancellation property, and a certain compatibility with pullbacks/pushouts.
