In this work we discuss an elementary self-contained presentation of the notion of a semiabelian category, introduced by Raikov and Palamodov. Fundamental examples of (non-abelian) semiabelian categories occuring in Functional Analysis and Topological Algebra are treated in detail throughout the paper.
