Written to be contributed as the "mathematical modeling" chapter of a book, edited by Elaine Landry, to be titled "Categories for the Working Philosopher". In this chapter, category theory is presented as a mathematical modeling framework that highlights the relationships between objects, rather than the objects in themselves. A working definition of model is given, and several examples of mathematical objects, such as vector spaces, groups, and dynamical systems, are considered as categorical models.
