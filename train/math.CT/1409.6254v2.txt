Let R be a commutative Noetherian ring and let \mathcal D(R) be its (unbounded) derived category. We show that all compactly generated t-structures in \mathcal D(R) associated to a left bounded filtration by supports of Spec(R) have a heart which is a Grothendieck category. Moreover, we identify all compactly generated t-structures in \mathcal D(R) whose heart is a module category. As geometric consequences for a compactly generated t-structure (\mathcal{U},\mathcal{U}^\perp [1]) in the derived category \mathcal{D}(\mathbb{X}) of a Noetherian scheme \mathbb{X}, we get the following: 1) If the sequence (\mathcal{U}[-n]\cap\mathcal{D}^{\leq 0}(\mathbb{X}))_{n\in\mathbb{N}} is stationnary, then the heart \mathcal{H} is a Grothendieck category; 2) If \mathcal{H} is a module category, then \mathcal{H} is always equivalent to \text{Qcoh}(\mathbb{Y}), for some affine subscheme \mathbb{Y}\subseteq\mathbb{X}; 3) If \mathbb{X} is connected, then: a) when \bigcap_{k\in\mathbb{Z}}\mathcal{U}[k]=0, the heart \mathcal{H} is a module category if, and only if, the given t-structure is a translation of the canonical t-estructure in \mathcal{D}(\mathbb{X}); b) when \mathbb{X} is irreducible, the heart \mathcal{H} is a module category if, and only if, there are an affine subscheme \mathbb{Y}\subseteq\mathbb{X} and an integer m such that \mathcal{U} consists of the complexes U\in\mathcal{D}(\mathbb{X}) such that the support of H^j(U) is in \mathbb{X}\setminus\mathbb{Y}, for all j>m.
