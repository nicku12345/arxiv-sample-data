This thesis deals with the general problem of determining when the heart \mathcal{H} of a t-structure in a triangulated category \mathcal{D} is a Grothendieck or a module category. As preliminaries, we study Grothendieck conditions AB3-AB5 for \mathcal{H} in a very general setting. We then concentrate on two familiar examples of smashing t-structures. First, we consider that \mathcal{D}=\mathcal{D}(\mathcal{G}) is the (unbounded) derived category of a Grothendieck category \mathcal{G} and that the t-structure is the one associated to a torsion pair \mathbf{t}=(\mathcal{T},\mathcal{F}) in \mathcal{G}, usually known as Happel-Reiten-Smal\emptyset t-structure. In the second example studied, we assume that \mathcal{D}=\mathcal{D}(R) is the derived category of a commutative Noetherian ring R and that the t-structure is compactly generated. On what concern the Happel-Reiten-Smal\emptyset example, we show that if \mathcal{H}=\mathcal{H}_\mathbf{t} is AB5, then \mathcal{F} is closed under taking direct limits in \mathcal{G}. Moreover, the converse is true, even implying that \mathcal{H}_\mathbf{t} is a Grothendieck category, for a wide class of torsion pairs in \mathcal{G} which includes the hereditary, tilting and cotilting ones. When \mathcal{G}=R-\text{Mod} is a module category, we are able to identify the hereditary torsion pairs \mathbf{t} in R-\text{Mod} for which \mathcal{H}_\mathbf{t} is a module category. When R is a commutative noetherian ring, we show that all compactly generated t-structures in \mathcal{D}(R) whose associated filtration by supports is left bounded have a heart \mathcal{H} which is a Grothendieck category. This is used to identify all compactly generated t-structures in \mathcal{D}(R) whose heart is a module category.
