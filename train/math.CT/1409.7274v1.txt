Let \mathcal{C} be a triangulated category with a proper class \xi of triangles. Asadollahi and Salarian introduced and studied \xi-Gorenstein projective and \xi-Gorenstein injective objects, and developed Gorenstein homological algebra in \mathcal{C}. In this paper, we further study Gorenstein homological properties for a triangulated category. First, we discuss the stability of \xi-Gorenstein projective objects, and show that the subcategory \mathcal{GP}(\xi) of all \xi-Gorenstein projective objects has a strong stability. That is, an iteration of the procedure used to define the \xi-Gorenstein projective objects yields exactly the \xi-Gorenstein projective objects. Second, we give some equivalent characterizations for \xi-Gorenstein projective dimension of object in \mathcal{C}.
