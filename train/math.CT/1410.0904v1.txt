Using results in a previous paper "Non-semistable exceptional objects in hereditary categories", we focus here on studying the topology of the space of Bridgeland stability conditions on D^b(Rep_k(Q )), where Q is the acyclic triangular quiver (the underlying graph is the extended Dynkin diagram \widetilde{\mathbb A}_2). In particular, we prove that this space is contractible (in the previous paper it was shown that it is connected).
