The notion of relative derived category with respect to a subcategory is introduced. A triangle-equivalence, which extends a theorem of Gao and Zhang [Gorenstein derived categories, \emph{J. Algebra} \textbf{323} (2010) 2041-2057] to the bounded below case, is obtained. Moreover, we interpret the relative derived functor \mathrm{Ext}_{\mathcal{X}\mathcal {A}}(-,-) as the morphisms in such derived category and give two applications.
