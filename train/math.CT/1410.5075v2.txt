We fix any bicategory \mathscr{A} together with a class of morphisms \mathbf{W}_{\mathscr{A}}, such that there is a bicategory of fractions \mathscr{A}[\mathbf{W}_{\mathscr{A}}^{-1}]. Given another such pair (\mathscr{B},\mathbf{W}_{\mathscr{B}}) and any pseudofunctor \mathcal{F}:\mathscr{A}\rightarrow\mathscr{B}, we find necessary and sufficient conditions in order to have an induced pseudofunctor \mathcal{G}:\mathscr{A}[\mathbf{W}_{\mathscr{A}}^{-1}]\rightarrow \mathscr{B}[\mathbf{W}_{\mathscr{B}}^{-1}]. Moreover, we give a simple description of \mathcal{G} in the case when the class \mathbf{W}_{\mathscr{B}} is "right saturated".
