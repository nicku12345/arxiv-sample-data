B-systems are algebras (models) of an essentially algebraic theory that is expected to be constructively equivalent to the essentially algebraic theory of C-systems which is, in turn, constructively equivalent to the theory of contextual categories. The theory of B-systems is closer in its form to the structures directly modeled by contexts and typing judgements of (dependent) type theories and further away from categories than contextual categories and C-systems.
