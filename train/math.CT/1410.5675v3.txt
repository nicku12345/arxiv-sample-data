We establish a highly flexible condition that guarantees that all colored symmetric operads in a symmetric monoidal model category are admissible, i.e., the category of algebras over any operad admits a model structure transferred from the original model category. We also give a necessary and sufficient criterion that ensures that a given weak equivalence of admissible operads admits rectification, i.e., the corresponding Quillen adjunction between the categories of algebras is a Quillen equivalence. In addition, we show that Quillen equivalences of underlying symmetric monoidal model categories yield Quillen equivalences of model categories of algebras over operads. Applications of these results include enriched categories, colored operads, prefactorization algebras, and commutative symmetric ring spectra.
