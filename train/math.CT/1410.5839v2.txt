Let S be a pomonoid. In this paper, {\bf Pos}-S, the category of S-posets and S-poset maps, is considered. One of the main aims of this paper is to draw attention to the notion of weak factorization systems in {\bf Pos}-S. We show that if the identity element of S is the bottom element, then (\mathcal{C_D}, \mathcal{E_S}) is a weak factorization system in {\bf Pos}-S, where \mathcal{C_D} and \mathcal{E_S} are the class of down-closed embedding S-poset maps and the class of all split S-poset epimorphisms, respectively. Among other things, we use a fibrewise notion of complete posets in the category {\bf Pos}-S/B under a particular case where B has trivial action. We get a necessary condition for regular injective objects in {\bf Pos}-S/B. Finally, we characterize them under a spacial case, where S is, a pogroup and conclude (Emb, Top) is a weak factorization system in {\bf Pos}-S.
