We fix any bicategory \mathscr{A} together with a class of morphisms \mathbf{W}_{\mathscr{A}}, such that there is a bicategory of fractions \mathscr{A}[\mathbf{W}_{\mathscr{A}}^{-1}]. Given another such pair (\mathscr{B},\mathbf{W}_{\mathscr{B}}) and any pseudofunctor \mathcal{F}:\mathscr{A}\rightarrow\mathscr{B}, we find necessary and sufficient conditions in order to have an induced equivalence of bicategories from \mathscr{A}[\mathbf{W}_{\mathscr{A}}^{-1}] to \mathscr{B}[\mathbf{W}_{\mathscr{B}}^{-1}]. In particular, this gives necessary and sufficient conditions in order to have an equivalence from any bicategory of fractions \mathscr{A}[\mathbf{W}_{\mathscr{A}}^{-1}] to any given bicategory \mathscr{B}.
