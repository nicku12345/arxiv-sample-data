Working in the framework of (T, V)-categories, for a symmetric monoidal closed category V and a (not necessarily cartesian) monad T, we present a common account to the study of ordered compact Hausdorff spaces and stably compact spaces on one side and monoidal categories and representable multicategories on the other one. In this setting we introduce the notion of dual for (T, V)-categories.
