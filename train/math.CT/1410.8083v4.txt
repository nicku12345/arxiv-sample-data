The present work presents some results about the categorial relation between logics and its categories of structures. A (propositional, finitary) logic is a pair given by a signature and Tarskian consequence relation on its formula algebra. The logics are the objects in our categories of logics; the morphisms are certain signature morphisms that are translations between logics (\cite{AFLM1},\cite{AFLM2},\cite{AFLM3} \cite{FC}). Morphisms between algebraizable logics (\cite{BP}) are translations that preserves algebraizing pairs (\cite{MaMe}): they can be completely encoded by certain functors defined on the quasi-variety canonically associated to the algebraizable logics. This kind of results will be useful in the development of a categorial approach to the representation theory of general logics (\cite{MaPi1}, \cite{MaPi2}, \cite{AJMP}).
