A modular object in a symmetric monoidal bicategory is a Frobenius algebra object whose product and coproduct are biadjoint, equipped with a braided structure and a compatible twist, satisfying rigidity, ribbon, pivotality, and modularity conditions. We prove that the oriented 3-dimensional bordism bicategory of 1-, 2-, and 3-manifolds is the free symmetric monoidal bicategory on a single anomaly-free modular object.
