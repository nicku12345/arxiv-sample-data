In this paper we develop a notion of measure theory over boolean toposes which is analogous to noncommutative measure theory, i.e. to the theory of von Neumann algebras. This is part of a larger project to study relations between topos theory and noncommutative geometry. The main result is a topos theoretic version of the modular time evolution of von Neumann algebra which take the form of a canonical R+*-principal bundle over any integrable locally separated boolean topos.
