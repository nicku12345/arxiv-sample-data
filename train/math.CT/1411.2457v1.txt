Let \mathcal{C} be a representable 2-category, and \mathfrak{T}_\bullet a 2-endofunctor of the arrow 2-category \mathcal{C}^\downarrow such that (i) \mathsf{cod} \mathfrak{T}_\bullet = \mathsf{cod} and (ii) \mathfrak{T}_\bullet preserves proneness of morphisms in \mathcal{C}^\downarrow. Then \mathfrak{T}_\bullet preserves fibrations and opfibrations in \mathcal{C}.   The proof takes Street's characterization of (e.g.) opfibrations as pseudoalgebras for 2-monads \mathfrak{L}_B on slice categories \mathcal{C}/B and develops it by defining a 2-monad \mathfrak{L}_\bullet on \mathcal{C}^\downarrow that takes change of base into account, and uses known results on the lifting of 2-functors to pseudoalgebras.
