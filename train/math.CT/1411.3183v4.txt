The topic of this paper is a generalization of Tannaka duality to coclosed categories. As an application we prove reconstruction theorems for coalgebras (and bialgebras) in categories of topological vector spaces over a nonarchimedean field K. In particular, our results imply reconstruction and recognition theorems for categories of locally analytic representations of compact p-adic groups.
