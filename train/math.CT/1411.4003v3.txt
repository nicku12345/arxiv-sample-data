We study the 3-Calabi-Yau categories \mathcal{D} arising from quivers with potential associated to a decorated marked surface \mathbf{S}_\bigtriangleup introduced by the first author. We prove two conjectures in the prequel, that under a bijection between certain objects in \mathcal{D} and certain arcs in \mathbf{S}_\bigtriangleup, the dimensions of morphisms between these objects equal the intersection numbers between the corresponding arcs.
