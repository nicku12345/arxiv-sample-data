The category of \mathfrak{C}-colored symmetric operads admits a cofibrantly generated model category structure. In this paper, we show that this model structure satisfies a relative left properness condition, i.e., that the class of weak equivalences between \Sigma-cofibrant operads is closed under cobase change along cofibrations. We also provide an example of Dwyer which shows that the model structure on \mathfrak{C}-colored symmetric operads is not left proper.
