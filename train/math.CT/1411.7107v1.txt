The Catalan simplicial set \mathbb{C} is known to classify skew-monoidal categories in the sense that a map from \mathbb{C} to a suitably defined nerve of \mathrm{Cat} is precisely a skew-monoidal category \cite{Catalan1}. We extend this result to the case of skew monoidales internal to any monoidal bicategory \mathcal{B}. We then show that monoidal bicategories themselves are classified by maps from \mathbb{C} to a suitably defined nerve of \mathrm{Bicat} and extend this result to obtain a definition of skew-monoidal bicategory that aligns with existing theory.
