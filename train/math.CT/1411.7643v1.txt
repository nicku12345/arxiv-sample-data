We consider stable representations of non-Dynkin quivers with respect to a central charge. On one condition the existence of a stable representation with self-extensions implies the existence of infinitely many stables without self-extensions. In this case the phases of the stable representations approach one or two limit points. In particular, the phases are not dense in two arcs.
