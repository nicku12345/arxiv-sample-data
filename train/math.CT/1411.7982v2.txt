Let G be a connected reductive group, with connected center, and X a smooth complete curve, both defined over an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero. Let \operatorname{Bun}_G denote the stack of G-bundles on X.   In analogy with the classical theory of Whittaker coefficients for automorphic functions, we construct a "Fourier transform" functor, called \mathsf{coeff}_{G,\mathsf{ext}}, from the DG category of \mathfrak{D}-modules on \operatorname{Bun}_G to a certain DG category \mathcal{W}h(G,\mathsf{ext}), called the \emph{extended Whittaker category}. Combined with work in progress by other mathematicians and the author, this construction allows to formulate the compatibility of the Langlands duality functor \mathbb{L}_G: \operatorname{IndCoh}_{\mathcal N}(\operatorname{LocSys}_{\check{G}}) \to \mathfrak{D}(\operatorname{Bun}_G) with the Whittaker model.   For G=GL_n and G=PGL_n, we prove that \mathsf{coeff}_{G,\mathsf{ext}} is fully faithful. This result guarantees that, for those groups, \mathbb{L}_G is unique (if it exists) and necessarily fully faithful.
