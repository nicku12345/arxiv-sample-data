For a certain kind of tensor functor F: \mathcal{C} \to \mathcal{D}, we define the relative modular object \chi_F \in \mathcal{D} as the "difference" between a left adjoint and a right adjoint of F. Our main result claims that, if \mathcal{C} and \mathcal{D} are finite tensor categories, then \chi_F can be written in terms of a categorical analogue of the modular function on a Hopf algebra. Applying this result to the restriction functor associated to an extension A/B of finite-dimensional Hopf algebras, we recover the result of Fischman, Montgomery and Schneider on the Frobenius type property of A/B. We also apply our results to obtain a "braided" version and a "bosonization" version of the result of Fischman et al.
