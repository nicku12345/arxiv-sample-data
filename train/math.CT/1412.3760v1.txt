Using the language of double categories we generalise a classical result on finite-product-preserving left Kan extensions, by Ad\'amek and Rosick\'y, to one on left Kan extensions that preserve algebraic structures defined by `suitable' colax-idempotent 2-monads, as well as obtain two related results. To be precise, by `suitable' 2-monads here we mean ones that extend to normal lax double monads. In an appendix we consider induced algebra structures on presheaf objects.
