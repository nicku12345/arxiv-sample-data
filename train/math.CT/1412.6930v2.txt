In this article the notions of (quasi weakly hereditary) general closure operator \mb{C} on a category \cx with respect to a class \cm of morphisms, and quasi factorization structures in a category \cx are introduced. It is shown that under certain conditions, if (\ce, \cm) is a quasi factorization structure in \cx, then \cx has quasi right \cm-factorization structure and quasi left \ce-factorization structure. It is also shown that for a quasi weakly hereditary and quasi idempotent QCD-closure operator with respect to a certain class \cm, every quasi factorization structure (\ce, \cm) yields a quasi factorization structure relative to the given closure operator; and that for a closure operator with respect to a certain class \cm, if the pair of classes of quasi dense and quasi closed morphisms forms a quasi factorization structure, then the closure operator is both quasi weakly hereditary and quasi idempotent. Several illustrative examples are furnished.
