We provide an algebraic formulation of C.Rovelli's relational quantum theory that is based on suitable notions of "non-commutative" higher operator categories, originally developed in the study of categorical non-commutative geometry. As a way to implement C.Rovelli's original intuition on the relational origin of space-time, in the context of our proposed algebraic approach to quantum gravity via Tomita-Takesaki modular theory, we tentatively suggest to use this categorical formalism in order to spectrally reconstruct non-commutative relational space-time geometries from categories of correlation bimodules between operator algebras of observables.
