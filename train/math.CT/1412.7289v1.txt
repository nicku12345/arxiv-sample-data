The category of modules over the endomorphism algebra of a rigid object in a Hom-finite triangulated category C has been given two different descriptions: On the one hand, as shown by Osamu Iyama and Yuji Yoshino, it is equivalent to an ideal quotient of a subcategory of C. On the other hand, Aslak Buan and Robert Marsh proved that this module category is also equivalent to some localisation of C. In this paper, we give a conceptual interpretation, inspired from homotopical algebra, of this double description. Our main aim, yet to be acheived, is to generalise Buan-Marsh's result to the case of Hom-infinite cluster categories. We note that, contrary to the more common case where a model category is a module category whose homotopy category is triangulated, we consider here some triangulated categories whose homotopy categories are module categories.
