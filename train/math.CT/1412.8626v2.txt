We study a regular closure operator in the category of quandles. We show that the regular closure operator and the pullback closure operator corresponding to the reflector from the category of quandles to its full subcategory of trivial quandles coincide, we give a simple description of this closure operator, and analyze some of its properties. The category of algebraically connected quandles turns out to be a connectedness in the sense of Arhangel'ski\v{\i} and Wiegandt corresponding to the full subcategory of trivial quandles, while the disconnectedness associated with it is shown to contain all quasi-trivial quandles. The separated objects for the pullback closure operator are precisely the trivial quandles. A simple formula describing the effective closure operator on congruences corresponding to the same reflector is also given.
