Higher structures - infinity algebras and other objects up to homotopy, categorified algebras, `oidified' concepts, operads, higher categories, higher Lie theory, higher gauge theory... - are currently intensively investigated in Mathematics and Physics. The present thesis deals with abstractions and flexibilizations of algebraic structures, and more precisely, with algebraic operads, homotopification and categorification.
