In this article we develop the theory of minors of non-commutative schemes. This study is motivated by applications in the theory of non-commutative resolutions of singularities of commutative schemes. In particular, we construct a categorical resolution for non-commutative curves and in the rational case show that it can be realized as the derived category of a quasi-hereditary algebra.
