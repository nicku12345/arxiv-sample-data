Cofibration categories are a formalization of homotopy theory useful for dealing with homotopy colimits that exist on the level of models as colimits of cofibrant diagrams. In this paper, we deal with their enriched version. Our main result claims that the category [\mathcal{C},\mathcal{M}] of enriched diagrams equipped with the projective structure inherits a structure of a cofibration category whenever \mathcal{C} is locally cofibrant (or, more generally, locally flat).
