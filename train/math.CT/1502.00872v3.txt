Let \mathcal C be a category with finite colimits, writing its coproduct +, and let (\mathcal D, \otimes) be a braided monoidal category. We describe a method of producing a symmetric monoidal category from a lax braided monoidal functor F: (\mathcal C,+) \to (\mathcal D, \otimes), and of producing a strong monoidal functor between such categories from a monoidal natural transformation between such functors. The objects of these categories, our so-called `decorated cospan categories', are simply the objects of \mathcal C, while the morphisms are pairs comprising a cospan X \rightarrow N \leftarrow Y in \mathcal C together with an element 1 \to FN in \mathcal D. Moreover, decorated cospan categories are multigraph categories---each object is equipped with a special commutative Frobenius monoid---and their functors preserve this structure.
