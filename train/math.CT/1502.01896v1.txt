In this short note, we construct a variant of the Bohr topos of a C*-algebra which takes into account the topology of the algebra in a finer way and such that this construction is stable under pullback along geometric morphisms. This generalizes a construction for finite dimensional algebras of G.Raynaud. Our idea is to construct the Bohr topos of a C*-algebra A as the sublocale of the lower power locale of the localic completion of A which classifies the commutative localic sub-C*-algebras of A.
