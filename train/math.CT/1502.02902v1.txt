We report on two classes of autoequivalences of the category of Yetter-Drinfeld modules over a finite group, or, equivalently the Drinfeld center of the category of representations of a finite group. Both operations are related to the r-th power operation, with r relatively prime to the exponent of the group. One is defined more generally for the group-theoretical fusion category defined by a finite group and an arbitrary subgroup, while the other seems particular to the case of Yetter-Drinfeld modules. Both autoequivalences preserve higher Frobenius-Schur indicators up to Galois conjugation, and they preserve tensor products, although neither of them can in general be endowed with the structure of a monoidal functor.
