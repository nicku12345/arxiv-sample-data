Group-theoretical fusion categories are defined by data concerning finite groups and their cohomology: A finite group G endowed with a three-cocycle \omega, and a subgroup H\subset G endowed with a two-cochain whose coboundary is the restriction of \omega.   The objects of the category are G-graded vector spaces with suitably twisted H-actions; the associativity of tensor products is controlled by \omega. Simple objects are parametrized in terms of projective representations of finite groups, namely of the stabilizers in H of right H-cosets in G, with respect to two-cocycles defined by the initial data.   We derive and study general formulas that express the higher Frobenius-Schur indicators of simple objects in a group-theoretical fusion category in terms of the group-theoretical and cohomological data defining the category and describing its simples.
