Premetrics and premetrisable spaces have been long studied and their topological interrelationships are well-understood. Consider the category {\bf Pre} of premetric spaces and \epsilon-\delta continuous functions as morphisms. The absence of the triangle inequality implies that the faithful functor {\bf Pre} \to {\bf Top} - where a premetric space is sent to the topological space it generates - is not full. Moreover, the sequential nature of topological spaces generated from objects in {\bf Pre} indicates that this functor is not surjective on objects either. Developed from work by Flagg and Weiss, we illustrate an extension {\bf Pre}\hookrightarrow {\bf P}  together with a faithful and surjective on objects left adjoint functor {\bf P} \to {\bf Top} as an extension of {\bf Pre} \to {\bf Top}. We show this represents an optimal scenario given that {\bf Pre} \to {\bf Top} preserves coproducts only. The objects in {\bf P} are metric-like objects valued on value distributive lattices whose limits and colimits we show to be generated by free locales on discrete sets.
