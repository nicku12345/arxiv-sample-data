A natural generalization of locally noetherian and locally coherent categories leads us to define locally type FP_{\infty} categories. They include not just all categories of modules over a ring, but also the category of sheaves over any concentrated scheme. In this setting we generalize and study the absolutely clean objects recently introduced in a paper of Bravo-Gillespie-Hovey. We show that \mathcal{D}(\mathcal{AC}), the derived category of absolutely clean objects, is always compactly generated and that it is embedded in K(Inj), the chain homotopy category of injectives, as a full subcategory containing the DG-injectives. Assuming the ground category \mathcal{G} has a set of generators satisfying a certain vanishing property, we also show that there is a recollement relating \mathcal{D}(\mathcal{AC}) to the (also compactly generated) derived category \mathcal{D}(\mathcal{G}). Finally, we generalize the Gorenstein AC-injectives of Bravo-Gillespie-Hovey, showing that they are the fibrant objects of a cofibrantly generated model structure on \mathcal{G}.
