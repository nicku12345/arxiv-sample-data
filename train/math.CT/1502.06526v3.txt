Motivated by the challenge of defining twisted quantum field theories in the context of higher categories, we develop a general framework for lax and oplax transformations and their higher analogs between strong (\infty, n)-functors. We construct a double (\infty,n)-category built out of the target (\infty, n)-category governing the desired diagrammatics. We define (op)lax transformations as functors into parts thereof, and an (op)lax twisted field theory to be a symmetric monoidal (op)lax natural transformation between field theories. We verify that lax trivially-twisted relative field theories are the same as absolute field theories. As a second application, we extend the higher Morita category of E_d-algebras in a symmetric monoidal (\infty, n)-category \mathcal{C} to an (\infty, n+d)-category using the higher morphisms in \mathcal{C}.
