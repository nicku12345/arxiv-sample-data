In this paper, we introduce a method to construct new categories which look like "cubes", and discuss model structures on the presheaf categories over them. First, we introduce a notion of thin-powered structure on small categories, which provides a generalized notion of "power-sets" on categories. Next, we see that if a small category \mathcal{R} admits a good thin-powered structure, we can construct a new category \square(\mathcal{R}) called the cubicalization of the category. We also see that \square(\mathcal{R}) is equipped with enough structures so that many arguments made for the classical cube category \square are also available. In particular, it is a test category in the sense of Grothendieck. The resulting categories contain the cube category \square, the cube category with connections \square^c, the extended cubical category \square_\Sigma introduced by Isaacson, and cube categories \square_G symmetrized by more general group operads G. We finally discuss model structures on the presheaf categories \square(\mathcal{R})^\wedge over cubicalizations. We prove that \square(\mathcal{R})^\wedge admits a model structure such that the simplicial realization \square(\mathcal{R})^\wedge\to SSet is a left Quillen functor. Moreover, in the case of \square_G for group operads G, \square^\wedge_G is a monoidal model category, and we have a sequence of monoidal Quillen equivalences \square Set \to \square_G^\wedge\to SSet. For example, if G=B is the group operad consisting of braid groups, the category \square^\wedge_B is a braided monoidal model category whose homotopy category is equivalent to that of SSet.
