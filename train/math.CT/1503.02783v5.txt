Motivated by the weighted Hurwitz product on sequences in an algebra, we produce a family of monoidal structures on the category of Joyal species. We suggest a family of tensor products for charades. We begin by seeing weighted derivational algebras and weighted Rota-Baxter algebras as special monoids and special semigroups, respectively, for the same monoidal structure on the category of graphs in a monoidal additive category. Weighted derivations are lifted to the categorical level.
