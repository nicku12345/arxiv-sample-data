We give a rigorous formulation of the intuitive idea that a differentiable map should be thesame thing as a locally, or infinitesimally, linear map: just as a linear map respects the operations of addition and multiplication by scalars ina vector space or module, a locally linear map is defined to be a map respecting two canonical operationsliving "over" its domain of definition.These two operations are composition laws of a canonical groupoid and of a scaled action category, respectively,fitting together into a canonical double category. Local linear algebra (of first order) is the study of such double categories and of their morphisms; it is a purely algebraic and conceptual (i.e., categorical and chart-independent) version of first order differential calculus. In subsequent work, the higher order theory (using higher multiple categories) will be investigated.
