Let j be a Lawvere-Tierney topology (a topology, for short) on an arbitrary topos \mathcal{E}, B an object of \mathcal{E}, and j_B = j\times 1_B the induced topology on the slice topos \mathcal{E}/B. In this manuscript, we analyze some properties of the pullback functor \Pi_B:\mathcal{E}\rightarrow \mathcal{E}/B which have deal with topology. Then for a left cancelable class \mathcal{M} of all j-dense monomorphisms in a topos \mathcal{E}, we achieve some necessary and sufficient conditions for that (\mathcal{M} , \mathcal{M}^{\perp}) is a factorization system in \mathcal{E}, which is related to the factorization systems in slice topoi \mathcal{E}/B, where B ranges over the class of objects of \mathcal{E}.   Among other things, we prove that an arrow f : X\rightarrow B in \mathcal{E} is a j_B-sheaf whenever the graph of f, is a section in \mathcal{E}/B as well as the object of sections S(f) of f, is a j-sheaf in \mathcal{E}. Furthermore, we introduce a class of monomorphisms in \mathcal{E}, which we call them j-essential.   Some equivalent forms of those and some of their properties are presented. Also, we prove that any presheaf in a presheaf topos has a maximal essential extension. Finally, some similarities and differences of the obtained result are discussed if we put a (productive) weak topology j, studied by some authors, instead of a topology.
