We study the role of the filter c\mathcal{K}(X) of cofinite subsets of X in the locale \mathcal{F}ilt(X) of all filters on X, by means of the double negation topology of \mathcal{F}ilt(X), and an essential locale morphism \mathcal{P}(X)^{op}\to\mathcal{F}ilt(X). Moreover, in the case X=\mathbb{N}, we characterise cofinite subsets by means of the double negation topology on the monoid \mathbb{M} of the maps \mathbb{N}\to \mathbb{N} with finite fibers, or on the submonoid \mathbb{E}\subseteq \mathbb{M} of the monotone and injective maps \mathbb{N}\to\mathbb{N}.
