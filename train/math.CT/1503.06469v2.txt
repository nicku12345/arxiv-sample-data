This paper introduces lax orthogonal algebraic weak factorisation systems on 2-categories and describes a method of constructing them. This method rests in the notion of simple 2-monad, that is a generalisation of the simple reflections studied by Cassidy, H\'ebert and Kelly. Each simple 2-monad on a finitely complete 2-category gives rise to a lax orthogonal algebraic weak factorisation system, and an example of a simple 2-monad is given by completion under a class of colimits. The notions of KZ lifting operation, lax natural lifting operation and lax orthogonality between morphisms are studied.
