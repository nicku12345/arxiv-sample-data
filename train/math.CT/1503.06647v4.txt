Chu connections and back diagonals are introduced as morphisms for distributors between categories enriched in a small quantaloid \mathcal{Q}. These notions, meaningful for closed bicategories, dualize the constructions of arrow categories and the Freyd completion of categories. It is shown that, for a small quantaloid \mathcal{Q}, the category of complete \mathcal{Q}-categories and left adjoints is a retract of the dual of the category of \mathcal{Q}-distributors and Chu connections, and it is dually equivalent to the category of \mathcal{Q}-distributors and back diagonals. As an application of Chu connections, a postulation of the intuitive idea of reduction of formal contexts in the theory of formal concept analysis is presented, and a characterization of reducts of formal contexts is obtained.
