We introduce the notion of a (\Pi,\lambda)-structure on a C-system and show that C-systems with (\Pi,\lambda)-structures are constructively equivalent to contextual categories with products of families of types. We then show how to construct (\Pi,\lambda)-structures on C-systems of the form CC({\cal C},p) defined by a universe p in a locally cartesian closed category \cal C from a simple pull-back square based on p. In the last section we prove a theorem that asserts that our construction is functorial.   This version introduces some changes compared to the previous one to ensure rigorous compatibility with arXiv:1409.7925v3.
