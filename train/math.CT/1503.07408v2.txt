We show that there is a fully faithful embedding of the category of manifolds with corners into the Cahiers topos, one of the premier models for Synthetic Differential Geometry. This embedding is shown to have a number of nice properties, such as preservation of open covers and transverse fibre products.   We develop a theory for gluing manifolds with corners in the Cahiers topos. In this setting, the result of gluing together manifolds with corners along a common face is shown to coincide with a pushout along an infinitesimally thickened face. Our theory is designed with a view toward future applications in Field Theory within the context of Synthetic Differential Geometry.
