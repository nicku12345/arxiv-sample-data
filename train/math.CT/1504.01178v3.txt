For a pivotal finite tensor category \mathcal{C} over an algebraically closed field k, we define the algebra \mathsf{CF}(\mathcal{C}) of class functions and the internal character \mathsf{ch}(X) \in \mathsf{CF}(\mathcal{C}) for an object X \in \mathcal{C} by using an adjunction between \mathcal{C} and its monoidal center \mathcal{Z}(\mathcal{C}). We also develop the integral theory in a unimodular finite tensor category by using the same adjunction. By utilizing these tools, we extend some results in the character theory of finite-dimensional Hopf algebras to this category-theoretical setting. Our main result is that the map \mathsf{ch}: \mathsf{Gr}_k(\mathcal{C}) \to \mathsf{CF}(\mathcal{C}) given by taking the internal character is a well-defined injective algebra map, where \mathsf{Gr}_k(\mathcal{C}) is the scalar extension of the Grothendieck ring of \mathcal{C} to k. Moreover, under the assumption that \mathcal{C} is unimodular, the map \mathsf{ch} is an isomorphism if and only if \mathcal{C} is semisimple.   As an application, we show that the algebra \mathsf{Gr}_{k}(\mathcal{C}) is semisimple if \mathcal{C} is a non-degenerate pivotal fusion category. If, moreover, \mathsf{Gr}_k(\mathcal{C}) is commutative, then the character table of \mathcal{C} is defined based on the integral theory. It turns out that the character table is obtained from the S-matrix if \mathcal{C} is a modular tensor category. Generalizing corresponding results in the finite group theory, we prove the orthogonality relations and the integrality.
