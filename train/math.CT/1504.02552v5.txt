In our recent paper [Sh1] a version of the "generalized Deligne conjecture" for abelian n-fold monoidal categories is proven. For n=1 this result says that, given an abelian monoidal k-linear category \mathscr{A} with unit e, k a field of characteristic 0, the dg vector space \mathrm{RHom}_{\mathscr{A}}(e,e) is the first component of a Leinster 1-monoid in \mathscr{A}lg(k) (provided a rather mild condition on the monoidal and the abelian structures in \mathscr{A}, called homotopy compatibility, is fulfilled).   In the present paper, we introduce a new concept of a {\it graded} Leinster monoid. We show that the Leinster monoid in \mathscr{A}lg(k), constructed by a monoidal k-linear abelian category in [Sh1], is graded. We construct a functor, assigning an algebra over the chain operad C(E_2,k), to a graded Leinster 1-monoid in \mathscr{A}lg(k), which respects the weak equivalences. Consequently, this paper together with loc.cit. provides a complete proof of the "generalized Deligne conjecture" for 1-monoidal abelian categories, in the form most accessible for applications to deformation theory (such as Tamarkin's proof of the Kontsevich formality).
