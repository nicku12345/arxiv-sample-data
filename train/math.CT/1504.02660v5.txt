We show that metric abstract elementary classes (mAECs) are, in the sense of [LR] (i.e. arXiv:1404.2528), coherent accessible categories with directed colimits, with concrete \aleph_1-directed colimits and concrete monomorphisms. More broadly, we define a notion of \kappa-concrete AEC---an AEC-like category in which only the \kappa-directed colimits need be concrete---and develop the theory of such categories, beginning with a category-theoretic analogue of Shelah's Presentation Theorem and a proof of the existence of an Ehrenfeucht-Mostowski functor in case the category is large. For mAECs in particular, arguments refining those in [LR] yield a proof that any categorical mAEC is \mu-d-stable in many cardinals below the categoricity cardinal.
