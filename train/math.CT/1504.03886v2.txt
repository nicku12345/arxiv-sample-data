Are all subcategories of locally finitely presentable categories that are closed under limits and \lambda-filtered colimits also locally presentable? For full subcategories the answer is affirmative. Makkai and Pitts proved that in the case \lambda=\aleph_0 the answer is affirmative also for all iso-full subcategories, \emph{i.\thinspace e.}, those containing with every pair of objects all isomorphisms between them. We discuss a possible generalization of this from \aleph_0 to an arbitrary \lambda.
