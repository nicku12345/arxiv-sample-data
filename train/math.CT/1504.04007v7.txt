We construct a pairing, which we call factorization homology, between framed manifolds and higher categories. The essential geometric notion is that of a vari-framing of a stratified manifold, which is a framing on each stratum together with a coherent system of compatibilities of framings along links between strata. Our main result constructs labeling systems on disk-stratified vari-framed n-manifolds from (\infty,n)-categories. These (\infty,n)-categories, in contrast with the literature to date, are not required to have adjoints. This allows the following conceptual definition: the factorization homology \[ \int_M\mathcal{C} \] of a framed n-manifold M with coefficients in an (\infty,n)-category \mathcal{C} is the classifying space of \cC-labeled disk-stratifications over M.
