We show that the category of abstract elementary classes (AECs) and concrete functors is closed under constructions of "limit type," which generalizes the approach of Mariano, Zambrano and Villaveces away from the syntactically oriented framework of institutions. Moreover, we provide a broader view of this closure phenomenon, considering a variety of categories of accessible categories with additional structure, and relaxing the assumption that the morphisms be concrete functors.
