We study transport of algebraic structures and prove a theorem which subsumes results of Comfort and Ross on topological group structures on Stone-Cech compactifications, of Chevalley and of Gil de Lamadrid and Jans on topological group and ring structures on universal covering spaces, and of Gleason on topological group structures on universal locally connected refinements.
