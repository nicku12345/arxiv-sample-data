A PROP is a symmetric monoidal category whose objects are the nonnegative integers and whose tensor product on objects is addition. A morphism from m to n in a PROP can be visualized as a string diagram with m input wires and n output wires. For a field k, the PROP \mathrm{FinVect}_k where morphisms are k-linear maps is used by Baez and Erbele to study signal-flow diagrams. We aim to generalize their result characterizing this PROP in terms of generators and relations by looking at the PROP \mathrm{Mat}(R) of matrices of values in R, where R is a commutative rig (that is, a generalization of a ring where the condition that each element has an additive inverse is relaxed). To this end, we show that the category of symmetric monoidal functors out of \mathrm{Mat}(R) is equivalent to the category of bicommutative bimonoids equipped with a certain map of rigs; such functors are called algebras. By choosing R correctly, we will see that the algebras of the PROP \mathrm{FinSpan} of finite sets and spans between them are bicommutative bimonoids, while the algebras of the PROP \mathrm{FinRel} of finite sets and relations between them are special bicommuative bimonoids and the algebras of \mathrm{Mat}(\mathbb Z) are bicommutative Hopf monoids.
