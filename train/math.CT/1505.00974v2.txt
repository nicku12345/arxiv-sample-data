The theory of derivators enhances and simplifies the theory of triangulated categories. In this article a notion of fibered (multi-)derivator is developed, which similarly enhances fibrations of (monoidal) triangulated categories. We present a theory of cohomological as well as homological descent in this language. The main motivation is a descent theory for Grothendieck's six operations.
