The dynamics of a one-sided subshift \mathsf{X} can be modeled by a set of partially defined bijections. From this data we define an inverse semigroup \mathcal{S}_{\mathsf{X}} and show that it has many interesting properties. We prove that the Carlsen-Matsumoto C*-algebra \mathcal{O}_\mathsf{X} associated to \mathsf{X} is canonically isomorphic to Exel's tight C*-algebra of \mathcal{S}_{\mathsf{X}}. As one consequence, we obtain that \mathcal{O}_\mathsf{X} can be written as a partial crossed product of a commutative C*-algebra by a countable group.
