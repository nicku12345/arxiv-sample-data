A characterization of simplicial objects in categories with finite products obtained by the reduced bar construction is given. The condition that characterizes such simplicial objects is a strictification of Segal's condition guaranteeing that the loop space of the geometric realization of a simplicial space X and the space X_1 are of the same homotopy type. A generalization of Segal's result appropriate for bisimplicial spaces is given. This generalization gives conditions guaranteing that the double loop space of the geometric realization of a bisimplicial space X and the space X_{11} are of the same homotopy type.
