This paper continues the series of papers that develop a new approach to syntax and semantics of dependent type theories. Here we study the interpretation of the rules of the identity types in the intensional Martin-Lof type theories on the C-systems that arise from universe categories. In the first part of the paper we develop constructions that produce interpretations of these rules from certain structures on universe categories while in the second we study the functoriality of these constructions with respect to functors of universe categories. The results of the first part of the paper play a crucial role in the construction of the univalent model of type theory in simplicial sets.
