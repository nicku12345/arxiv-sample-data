We introduce the new concept of cartesian module over a pseudofunctor R from a small category to the category of small preadditive categories. Already the case when R is a (strict) functor taking values in the category of commutative rings is sufficient to cover the classical construction of quasi-coherent sheaves of modules over a scheme. On the other hand, our general setting allows for a good theory of contravariant additive locally flat functors, providing a geometrically meaningful extension of Crawley-Boevey's Representation Theorem. As an application, we relate and extend some previous constructions of the pure derived category of a scheme.
