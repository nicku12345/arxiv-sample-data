Kurz et al. have recently shown that infinite \lambda-trees with finitely many free variables modulo \alpha-equivalence form a final coalgebra for a functor on the category of nominal sets. Here we investigate the rational fixpoint of that functor. We prove that it is formed by all rational \lambda-trees, i.e. those \lambda-trees which have only finitely many subtrees (up to isomorphism). This yields a corecursion principle that allows the definition of operations such as substitution on rational \lambda-trees.
