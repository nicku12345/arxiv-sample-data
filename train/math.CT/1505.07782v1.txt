We introduce the notion of Whitehead sequence which is defined for a base category together with a system of abstract actions over it. In the classical case of groups and group actions the Whitehead sequences are precisely the crossed-modules of groups. For a general setting we give sufficient conditions for the existence of a categorical equivalence between internal groupoids and Whitehead sequences.
