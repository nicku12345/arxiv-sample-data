We generalise Yoshino's definition of a degeneration of two Cohen Macaulay modules to a definition of degeneration between two objects in a triangulated category. We derive some natural properties for the triangulated category and the degeneration under which the Yoshino-style degeneration is equivalent to the degeneration defined by a specific distinguished triangle analogous to Zwara's characterisation of degeneration in module varieties.
