There are two ways to turn a categorical model for pure quantum theory into one for mixed quantum theory, both resulting in a category of completely positive maps. One has quantum systems as objects, whereas the other also allows classical systems on an equal footing. The former has been axiomatized using environment structures. We extend this axiomatization to the latter by introducing decoherence structures.
