By careful analysis of the comparison map from a simplicial set to its image under Kan's ex-infinity functor we obtain a new and combinatorial proof that it is a weak homotopy equivalence. Moreover, we obtain a presentation of it as a strong anodyne extension. From this description we are able to quickly deduce some basic facts about ex-infinity and hence provide a new construction of the Kan-Quillen model structure on simplicial sets, which avoids the use of topological spaces or minimal fibrations.
