To a Lie groupoid over a compact base, the associated group of bisection is an (infinite-dimensional) Lie group. Moreover, under certain circumstances one can reconstruct the Lie groupoid from its Lie group of bisections. In the present article we consider functorial aspects of these construction principles. The first observation is that this procedure is functorial (for morphisms fixing the base). Moreover, it gives rise to an adjunction between the category of Lie groupoids over a fixed base and the category of Lie groups acting on the base. In the last section we then show how to promote this adjunction to almost an equivalence of categories.
