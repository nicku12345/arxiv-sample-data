We introduce a notion of bimodule in the setting of enriched \infty-categories, and use this to construct a double \infty-category of enriched \infty-categories where the two kinds of 1-morphisms are functors and bimodules. We then consider a natural definition of natural transformations in this context, and show that in the underlying (\infty,2)-category of enriched \infty-categories with functors as 1-morphisms the 2-morphisms are given by natural transformations.
