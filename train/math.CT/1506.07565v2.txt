We show that in the Deligne categories \mathrm{Rep}(S_t) for t a transcendental number, the only simple algebra objects are images of simple algebras in the category of representations of a symmetric group under a canonical induction functor. They come in families which interpolate the families of algebras of functions on the cosets of H\times S_{n-k} in S_n, for a fixed subgroup H of S_k.
