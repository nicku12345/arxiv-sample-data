A detailed description of internal bicategory in the category of groups is derived from the general description of internal bicategories in weakly Mal'tsev sesquicategories. The example of bicategory of paths in a topological abelian group is presented, as well as a description of internal bicategories in weakly Mal'tsev categories with a V-Mal'tsev operation in the sense of Pedicchio.
