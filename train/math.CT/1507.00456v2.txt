We study the derived categories of small categories over commutative noetherian rings. Our main result is a parametrization of the localizing subcategories in terms of the spectrum of the ring and the localizing subcategories over residue fields. In the special case of representations of Dynkin quivers over a commutative noetherian ring we give a complete description of the localizing subcategories of the derived category, a complete description of the thick subcategories of the perfect complexes and show the telescope conjecture holds. We also present some results concerning the telescope conjecture more generally.
