We give an exposition and generalization of Orlov's theorem on graded Gorenstein rings. We show the theorem holds for non-negatively graded rings which are Gorenstein in an appropriate sense and whose degree zero component is an arbitrary non-commutative right noetherian ring of finite global dimension. A short treatment of some foundations for local cohomology and Grothendieck duality at this level of generality is given in order to prove the theorem. As an application we give an equivalence of the derived category of a commutative complete intersection with the homotopy category of graded matrix factorizations over a related ring.
