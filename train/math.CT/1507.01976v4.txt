We develop a theory of Mackey functors on epiorbital categories which simultaneously generalizes the theory of genuine G-spectra for a finite group G and the theory of n-excisive functors on the category of spectra. Using a new theory of stratifications of a stable \infty-category along a finite poset, we prove a simultaneous generalization of two reconstruction theorems: one by Abram and Kriz on recovering G-spectra from structure on their geometric fixed point spectra for abelian G, and one by Arone and Ching that recovers an n-excisive functor from structure on its derivatives. We deduce a strong tom Dieck splitting theorem for K(n)-local G-spectra and reprove a theorem of Kuhn on the K(n)-local splitting of Taylor towers.
