Several methods for constructing left determined model structures are expounded. The starting point is Olschok's work on locally presentable categories. We give sufficient conditions to obtain left determined model structures on a full reflective subcategory, on a full coreflective subcategory and on a comma category. An application is given by constructing a left determined model structure on star-shaped weak transition systems.
