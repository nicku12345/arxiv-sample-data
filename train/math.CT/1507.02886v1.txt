We introduce the notion of Mal'tsev reflection which allows us to set up a partial notion of Mal'tsevness with respect to a class \Sigma of split epimorphisms stable under pullback and containing the isomorphisms, and we investigate what is remaining of the properties of the global Mal'tsev context. We introduce also the notion of partial protomodularity in the non-pointed context.
