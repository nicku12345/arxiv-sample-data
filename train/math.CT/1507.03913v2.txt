We develop the theory of recollements in a stable \infty-categorical setting. In the axiomatization of Beilinson, Bernstein and Deligne, recollement situations provide a generalization of Grothendieck's "six functors" between derived categories. The adjointness relations between functors in a recollement \mathbf{D}^0\leftrightarrow \mathbf{D} \leftrightarrow \mathbf{D}^1 induce a "recoll\'ee" t-structure \mathfrak{t}_0\uplus\mathfrak{t}1 on \mathbf{D} , given t-structures \mathfrak{t}_0,\mathfrak{t}_1 on \mathbf{D}^0, \mathbf{D}^1. Such a classical result, well-known in the setting of triangulated categories, is recasted in the setting of stable \infty-categories and the properties of the associated (\infty-categorical) factorization systems are investigated. In the geometric case of a stratified space, various recollements arise, which "interact well" with the combinatorics of the intersections of strata to give a well-defined, associative \uplus operation. From this we deduce a generalized associative property for n-fold gluing \mathfrak{t}_0\uplus\cdots\uplus \mathfrak{t}_n, valid in any stable \infty-category.
