Finite graphs that have a common chromatic polynomial have the same number of regular n-colorings. A natural question is whether there exists a natural bijection between regular n-colorings. We address this question using a functorial formulation. Let G be a simple graph. Then for each set X we can associate a set of X-colorings. This defines a functor, "chromatic functor" from the category of sets with injections to itself. The first main result verifies that two finite graphs determine isomorphic chromatic functors if and only if they have the same chromatic polynomial.   Chromatic functors can be defined for arbitrary, possibly infinite, graphs. This fact enables us to investigate functorial chromatic theory for infinite graphs. We prove that chromatic functors satisfy the Cantor-Bernstein-Schr\"oder property. We also prove that countable connected trees determine isomorphic chromatic functors. Finally, we present a pair of infinite graphs that determine non-isomorphic chromatic functors.
