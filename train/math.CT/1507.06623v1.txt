The Euler characteristic was defined for finite strict n-categories by Leinster using the theory of enriched categories. This was an extension of some of his earlier work, which defined Euler characteristic for finite categories. Building on Leinster's work, we extend the notion of Euler characteristic to certain finite weak 2-categories and present a sketch of a similar extension to weak n-categories. We also discuss the extension of the Euler characteristic to certain finite \left(\infty,1\right)-categories.
