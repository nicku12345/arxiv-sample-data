We describe indecomposable objects in Deligne's category \underline{\operatorname{Re}}\!\operatorname{p}(O_\delta) and explain how to decompose their tensor products. We then classify thick ideals in \underline{\operatorname{Re}}\!\operatorname{p}(O_\delta). As an application we classify the indecomposable summands of tensor powers of the standard representation of the orthosymplectic supergroup up to isomorphism.
