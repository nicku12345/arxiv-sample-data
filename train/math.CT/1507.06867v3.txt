Let G be a finite group. To any family \mathscr{F} of subgroups of G, we associate a thick \otimes-ideal \mathscr{F}^{\mathrm{Nil}} of the category of G-spectra with the property that every G-spectrum in \mathscr{F}^{\mathrm{Nil}} (which we call \mathscr{F}-nilpotent) can be reconstructed from its underlying H-spectra as H varies over \mathscr{F}. A similar result holds for calculating G-equivariant homotopy classes of maps into such spectra via an appropriate homotopy limit spectral sequence. In general, the condition E\in \mathscr{F}^{\mathrm{Nil}} implies strong collapse results for this spectral sequence as well as its dual homotopy colimit spectral sequence. As applications, we obtain Artin and Brauer type induction theorems for G-equivariant E-homology and cohomology, and generalizations of Quillen's \mathcal{F}_p-isomorphism theorem when E is a homotopy commutative G-ring spectrum.   We show that the subcategory \mathscr{F}^{\mathrm{Nil}} contains many G-spectra of interest for relatively small families \mathscr{F}. These include G-equivariant real and complex K-theory as well as the Borel-equivariant cohomology theories associated to complex oriented ring spectra, any L_n-local spectrum, the classical bordism theories, connective real K-theory, and any of the standard variants of topological modular forms. In each of these cases we identify the minimal family such that these results hold.
