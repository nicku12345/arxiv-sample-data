We show that if M is a Frobenius manifold of dimension n such that T_{x} M is semisimple for every x \in M, then there exists a canonical 2-vector bundle \mathcal{B} over M of rank n. This 2-vector bundle encodes the information about the maximal category of D-branes associated to the open closed topological field theories defined by the Frobenius algebras T_{x} M. In particular this construction answers a conjecture of Graeme Segal in~\cite{segal07:_what_is_ellip_objec}. We also explain the relation of the labels of the D-branes to Azumaya algebras and twisted vector bundles on the spectral cover S of M.
