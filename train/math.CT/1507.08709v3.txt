In [BaSc2], the author and Tomer Schlank introduced a much weaker homotopical structure than a model category, which we called a "weak cofibration category". We further showed that a small weak cofibration category induces in a natural way a model category structure on its indcategory, provided the ind-category satisfies a certain two out of three property. The main purpose of this paper is to give sufficient intrinsic conditions on a weak cofibration category for this two out of three property to hold. We consider an application to the category of compact metrizable spaces, and thus obtain a model structure on its ind-category. This model structure is defined on a category that is closely related to a category of topological spaces and has many convenient formal properties. A more general application of these results, to the (opposite) category of separable C^*-algebras, appears in a paper by the author, Michael Joachim and Snigdhayan Mahanta [BJM].
