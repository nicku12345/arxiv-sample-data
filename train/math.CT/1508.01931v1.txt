Multimodal normal incestual systems are investigated in terms of multiple categories. The different sorted composition of operators are exhibited as 2-cells in multiple categories built up from 2-categories giving rise to different axioms. Subsequently, coherence results are proved pointing the connections with (usual and mixed) Distributive Laws. This is given as a geometrical description of certain axioms inside various systems with a number of necessity and possibility operators.
