We study the spectrum of prime ideals in the tensor-triangulated category of compact equivariant spectra over a finite group. We completely describe this spectrum as a set for all finite groups. We also make significant progress in determining its topology and obtain a complete answer for groups of square-free order. For general finite groups, we describe the topology up to an unresolved indeterminacy, which we reduce to the case of p-groups. We then translate the remaining unresolved question into a new chromatic blue-shift phenomenon for Tate cohomology. Finally, we draw conclusions on the classification of thick tensor ideals.
