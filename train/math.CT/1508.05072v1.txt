Characterising colimiting omega-cocones of projection pairs in terms of least upper bounds of their embeddings and projections is important to the solution of recursive domain equations. We present a universal characterisation of this local property as omega-cocontinuity of locally continuous functors. We present a straightforward proof using the enriched Yoneda embedding. The proof can be generalised to Cattani and Fiore's notion of locality for adjoint pairs.
