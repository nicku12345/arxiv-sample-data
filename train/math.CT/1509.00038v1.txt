Subfactor standard invariants encode quantum symmetries. The small index subfactor classification program has been a rich source of interesting quantum symmetries. We give the complete classification of subfactor standard invariants to index 5\frac{1}{4}, which includes 3+\sqrt{5}, the first interesting composite index.
