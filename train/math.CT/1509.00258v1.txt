Let \mathcal{G} be a Grothendieck category, let \mathbf{t}=(\mathcal{T},\mathcal{F}) be a torsion pair in \mathcal{G} and let (\mathcal{U}_\mathbf{t},\mathcal{W}_\mathbf{t}) be the associated Happel-Reiten-Smal\o t-structure in the derived category \mathcal{D}(\mathcal{G}). We prove that the heart of this t-structure is a Grothendieck category if, and only if, the torsionfree class \mathcal{F} is closed under taking direct limits in \mathcal{G}.
