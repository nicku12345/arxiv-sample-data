We prove the existence of minimal models for fibrations between dendroidal sets in the model structure for infinity-operads, as well as in the covariant model structure for algebras and in the stable one for connective spectra. In an appendix, we explain how our arguments can be used to extend the results of Cisinski, giving the existence of minimal fibrations in model categories of presheaves over generalised Reedy categories of a rather common type. Besides some applications to the theory of algebras over infinity-operads, we also prove a gluing result for parametrized connective spectra (or Gamma-spaces).
