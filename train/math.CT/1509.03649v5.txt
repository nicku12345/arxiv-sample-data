The attempt is to give a formal concpet of system, and with this provide a definition of category, that will also satisfy the definition of a system. An axiomatic base is given, for constructing the group of integers. In the process, we define a group of automorphisms; we are defining an ordered group of functors with a natural transformation between any two. We give an isomorphism from the group of integers into the group of automorphisms, as guaranteed by Cayley's Theorem. The ultimate aim is to use these definitions and concepts, of system and category, to give a general description of mathematics. The third chapter is dedicated to set theory and we provide a proof of the Yoneda Lemma. This is used to prove Cayley's theorem. We see how this relates to the construction of the integers, before introducing representable functors. After lattices, we devote a chapter to group theory. We conlcude with a brief description of topological systems; we describe them as functors on algebraic categories, with a subset of invariant objects. This new version includes a first description of linear spaces. The section for operations has been rewritten and corrected.
