Given a particular collection of categorical axioms, aimed at capturing properties of the category of locales, we show that if \mathcal{C} is a category that satisfies the axioms then so too is the category [ G, \mathcal{C}] of G-objects, for any internal group G. To achieve this we prove a general categorical result: if an object S is double exponentiable in a category with finite products then so is its associated trivial G-object (S, \pi_2: G \times S \rightarrow S). The result holds even if S is not exponentiable.   An example is given of a category \mathcal{C} that satisfies the axioms, but for which there is no elementary topos \mathcal{E} such that \mathcal{C} is the category of locales over \mathcal{E}.   It is shown, in outline, how the results can be extended from groups to groupoids.
