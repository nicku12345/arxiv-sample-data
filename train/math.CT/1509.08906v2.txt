In this extended note we give a precise definition of fully extended topological field theories \`a la Lurie. Using complete n-fold Segal spaces as a model, we construct an (\infty,n)-category of n-dimensional cobordisms, possibly with tangential structure. We endow it with a symmetric monoidal structure and show that we can recover the usual category of cobordisms n\operatorname{Cob} and the cobordism bicategory n\operatorname{Cob}^{ext} from it.
