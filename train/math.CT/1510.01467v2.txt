We study Quillen model categories equipped with a monoidal skew closed structure that descends to a genuine monoidal closed structure on the homotopy category. Our examples are 2-categorical and include permutative categories and bicategories. Using the skew framework, we adapt Eilenberg and Kelly's theorem relating monoidal and closed structure to the homotopical setting. This is applied to the construction of monoidal bicategories arising from the pseudo-commutative 2-monads of Hyland and Power.
