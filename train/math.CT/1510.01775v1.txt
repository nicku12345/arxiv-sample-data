We consider locales B as algebras in the tensor category s\ell of sup-lattices. We show the equivalence between the Joyal-Tierney descent theorem for open localic surjections sh(B) \stackrel{q}{\longrightarrow} \mathcal{E} in Galois theory [An extension of the Galois Theory of Grothendieck, AMS Memoirs 151] and a Tannakian recognition theorem over s\ell for the s\ell-functor Rel(E) \stackrel{Rel(q^*)}{\longrightarrow} Rel(sh(B)) \cong (B-Mod)_0 into the s\ell-category of discrete B-modules. Thus, a new Tannaka recognition theorem is obtained, essentially different from those known so far. This equivalence follows from two independent results. We develop an explicit construction of the localic groupoid G associated by Joyal-Tierney to q, and do an exhaustive comparison with the Deligne Tannakian construction of the Hopf algebroid L associated to Rel(q^*), and show they are isomorphic, that is, L \cong \mathcal{O}(G). On the other hand, we show that the s\ell-category of relations of the classifying topos of any localic groupoid G, is equivalent to the s\ell-category of L-comodules with discrete subjacent B-module, where L = \mathcal{O}(G).   We are forced to work over an arbitrary base topos because, contrary to the neutral case developed over Sets in [A Tannakian Context for Galois Theory, Advances in Mathematics 234], here change of base techniques are unavoidable.
