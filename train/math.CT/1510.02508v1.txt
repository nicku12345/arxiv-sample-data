Treating (d,p) reactions in a Faddeev-AGS framework requires the interactions in the sub-systems as input. We derived separable representations for the neutron- and proton-nucleus interactions from phenomenological global optical potentials. In order to take into account excitations of the nucleus, excitations need to be included explicity, leading to a coupled-channel separable representation of the optical potential.
