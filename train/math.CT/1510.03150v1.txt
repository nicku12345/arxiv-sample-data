We functorially associate to each relative \infty-category (R,W) a simplicial space N^R_\infty(R,W), called its Rezk nerve (a straightforward generalization of Rezk's "classification diagram" construction for relative categories). We prove the following local and global universal properties of this construction: (i) that the complete Segal space generated by the Rezk nerve N^R_\infty(R,W) is precisely the one corresponding to the localization R[[W^{-1}]]; and (ii) that the Rezk nerve functor defines an equivalence RelCat_\infty [[ W_{BK}^{-1} ]] \xrightarrow{\sim} Cat_\infty from a localization of the \infty-category of relative \infty-categories to the \infty-category of \infty-categories.
