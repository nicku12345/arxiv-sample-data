We provide, among other things: (i) a Bousfield--Kan formula for colimits in \infty-categories (generalizing the 1-categorical formula for a colimit as a coequalizer of maps between coproducts); (ii) \infty-categorical generalizations of Barwick--Kan's Theorem B_n and Dwyer--Kan--Smith's Theorem C_n (regarding homotopy pullbacks in the Thomason model structure, which themselves vastly generalize Quillen's Theorem B); and (iii) an articulation of the simultaneous and interwoven functoriality of colimits (or dually, of limits) for natural transformations and for pullback along maps of diagram \infty-categories.
