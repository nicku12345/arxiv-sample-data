We study the *homotopy theory* of \infty-categories enriched in the \infty-category sS of simplicial spaces. That is, we consider sS-enriched \infty-categories as presentations of ordinary \infty-categories by means of a "local" geometric realization functor Cat_{sS} \to Cat_\infty, and we prove that their homotopy theory presents the \infty-category of \infty-categories, i.e. that this functor induces an equivalence Cat_{sS} [[ W_{DK}^{-1} ]] \xrightarrow{\sim} Cat_\infty from a localization of the \infty-category of sS-enriched \infty-categories.   Following Dwyer--Kan, we define a *hammock localization* functor from relative \infty-categories to sS-enriched \infty-categories, thus providing a rich source of examples of sS-enriched \infty-categories. Simultaneously unpacking and generalizing one of their key results, we prove that given a relative \infty-category admitting a *homotopical three-arrow calculus*, one can explicitly describe the hom-spaces in the \infty-category presented by its hammock localization in a much more explicit and accessible way.   As an application of this framework, we give sufficient conditions for the Rezk nerve of a relative \infty-category to be a (complete) Segal space, generalizing joint work with Low.
