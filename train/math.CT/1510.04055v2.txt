We prove that the category of dg-modules and dg-algebras in a Grothendieck quasi-abelian category are endowed with a Quillen model structure. This allows some flexibility in setting up a theory of derived algebraic geometry in the infinite dimensional setting. For example, the category of complete bornological vector spaces, or equivalently, convenient vector spaces, is a Grothendieck quasi-abelian category. Closely related is the Grothendieck quasi-abelian category of ind-Banach spaces whose associated model category is shown to be Quillen equivalent. Applications include the Chevalley-Eilenberg resolution and the Koszul resolution of a commutative monoid object in a Grothendieck quasi-abelian category. These can be used for the calculation of derived quotients by an infinite dimensional Lie algebra and derived intersections respectively.
