We prove that a model structure on a relative \infty-category (M,W) gives an efficient and computable way of accessing the hom-spaces hom_{M[[W^{-1}]]}(x,y) in the localization. More precisely, we show that when the source x \in M is *cofibrant* and the target y \in M is *fibrant*, then this hom-space is a "quotient" of the hom-space hom_M(x,y) by either of a *left homotopy relation* or a *right homotopy relation*.
