Given groupoids \mathscr G and \mathscr H as well as an isomorphism \Psi:\text{Sd}\,\mathscr G\cong\text{Sd}\,\mathscr H between subdivisions, we construct an isomorphism P:\mathscr G\cong\mathscr H. If \Psi equals \text{Sd} F for some functor F, then the constructed isomorphism P is equal to F. It follows that the restriction of \text{Sd} to the category of groupoids is conservative. These results do not hold for arbitrary categories.
