Given functors F,G:\mathcal C\to\mathcal D between small categories, when is it possible to say that F can be "continuously deformed" into G in a manner that is not necessarily reversible? In an attempt to answer this question in purely category-theoretic language, we use adjunctions to define a `taxotopy' preorder \preceq on the set of functors \mathcal C\to\mathcal D, and combine this data into a `fundamental poset' (\Lambda(\mathcal C,\mathcal D),\preceq).   The main objects of study in this paper are the fundamental posets \Lambda(\mathbf 1,P) and \Lambda(\mathbb Z,P) for a poset P, where \mathbf 1 is the singleton poset and \mathbb Z is the ordered set of integers; they encode the data about taxotopy of points and chains of P respectively. Borrowing intuition from homotopy theory, we show that a suitable cone construction produces `null-taxotopic' posets and prove two forms of van Kampen theorem for computing fundamental posets via covers of posets.
