We study the interplay between the notions of n-coherent rings and finitely n-presented modules, and also study the relative homological algebra associated to them. We show that the n-coherency of a ring is equivalent to the thickness of the class of finitely n-presented modules. The relative homological algebra part comes from the study of orthogonal complements to this class of modules with respect to {\rm Ext}^1_R(F,-) and {\rm Tor}_1^R(F,-). We also construct cotorsion pairs from these orthogonal complements, allowing us to provide further characterizations of n-coherent rings.
