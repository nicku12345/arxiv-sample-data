The Adams spectral sequence is available in any triangulated category equipped with a projective or injective class. Higher Toda brackets can also be defined in a triangulated category, as observed by B. Shipley based on J. Cohen's approach for spectra. We provide a family of definitions of higher Toda brackets, show that they are equivalent to Shipley's, and show that they are self-dual. Our main result is that the Adams differential d_r in any Adams spectral sequence can be expressed as an (r+1)-fold Toda bracket and as an r^{\text{th}} order cohomology operation. We also show how the result simplifies under a sparseness assumption, discuss several examples, and give an elementary proof of a result of Heller, which implies that the three-fold Toda brackets in principle determine the higher Toda brackets.
