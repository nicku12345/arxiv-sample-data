The goal of the paper is to categorify Dijkgraaf-Witten theory, aiming at providing foundation for a direct construction of Dijkgraaf-Witten theory as an Extended Topological Quantum Field Theory. The main tool is cohomology with coefficients in a Picard groupoid, namely the Picard groupoid of hermitian lines.
