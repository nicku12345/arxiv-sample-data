Let I be a non-empty set and \mathcal{D} an ultrafilter over I. For similar algebraic structures B_i, i\in I let \Pi (B_i|i\in I) and \Pi _{\mathcal{D}}(B_i|i\in I) denote the direct product and the ultraproduct of B_i, respectively. Let \mathcal{D}^* denote the ultraproduct congruence on \Pi (B_i|i\in I). Let the \wedge-semilattice of all congruences on an algebraic structure B denoted by {\bf Con}(B). In this paper we show that, for any similar algebraic structures A_i, i\in I, there is an embedding \Phi of \Pi _{\mathcal{D}}({\bf Con}(A_i)|i\in I) into {\bf Con}(\Pi _{\mathcal{D}}(A_i|i\in I). We also show that, for every \sigma \in \Pi ({\bf Con}(A_i)|i\in I), the factor algebra \Pi _{\mathcal{D}}(A_i|i\in I)/\Phi (\sigma /\mathcal{D}^*) is isomorphic to \Pi _{\mathcal{D}}(A_i/\sigma (i)|i\in I). Moreover, if A is an algebraic structure, \sigma(i)\in {\bf Con}(A), i\in I and \mathcal{D}=\{ K_j| j\in J\} then the restriction of \Phi (\sigma /\mathcal{D}^*) to A equals \vee _{j\in J}(\wedge _{k\in K_j}\sigma (k)).
