This paper dualizes the setting of affine spaces as originally introduced by Diers for application to algebraic geometry and expanded upon by various authors, to show that the fundamental groups of pointed topological spaces appear as the structures of dually affine spaces. The dual of the Zariski closure operator is introduced, and the 1-sphere and its copowers together with their fundamental groups are shown to be examples of complete objects with respect to the Zariski dual closure operator.
