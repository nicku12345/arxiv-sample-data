Under a minimum of assumptions, we develop in generality the basic theory of universal algebra in a symmetric monoidal closed category \mathcal{V} with respect to a specified system of arities j:\mathcal{J} \hookrightarrow \mathcal{V}. Lawvere's notion of algebraic theory generalizes to this context, resulting in the notion of single-sorted \mathcal{V}-enriched \mathcal{J}-cotensor theory, or \mathcal{J}-theory for short. For suitable choices of \mathcal{V} and \mathcal{J}, such \mathcal{J}-theories include the enriched algebraic theories of Borceux and Day, the enriched Lawvere theories of Power, the equational theories of Linton's 1965 work, and the \mathcal{V}-theories of Dubuc, which are recovered by taking \mathcal{J} = \mathcal{V} and correspond to arbitrary \mathcal{V}-monads on \mathcal{V}. We identify a modest condition on j that entails that the \mathcal{V}-category of \mathcal{T}-algebras exists and is monadic over \mathcal{V} for every \mathcal{J}-theory \mathcal{T}, even when \mathcal{T} is not small and \mathcal{V} is neither complete nor cocomplete. We show that j satisfies this condition if and only if j presents \mathcal{V} as a free cocompletion of \mathcal{J} with respect to the weights for left Kan extensions along j, and so we call such systems of arities eleutheric. We show that \mathcal{J}-theories for an eleutheric system may be equivalently described as (i) monads in a certain one-object bicategory of profunctors on \mathcal{J}, and (ii) \mathcal{V}-monads on \mathcal{V} satisfying a certain condition. We prove a characterization theorem for the categories of algebras of \mathcal{J}-theories, considered as \mathcal{V}-categories \mathcal{A} equipped with a specified \mathcal{V}-functor \mathcal{A} \rightarrow \mathcal{V}.
