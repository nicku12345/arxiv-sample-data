Motivated in part by the study of the stable homology of automorphism groups of free groups, we consider cohomological calculations in the category \mathcal{F}(\textbf{gr}) of functors from finitely generated free groups to abelian groups.In particular, we compute the groups Ext^*\_{\mathcal{F}(\textbf{gr})}(T^n \circ \mathfrak{a}, T^m \circ \mathfrak{a}) where \mathfrak{a} is the abelianization functor and T^n is the n-th tensor power functor for abelian groups. These groups are shown to be non-zero if and only if *=m-n \geq 0 and Ext^{m-n}\_{\mathcal{F}(\textbf{gr})}(T^n \circ \mathfrak{a}, T^m \circ \mathfrak{a})=\mathbb{Z}[Surj(m,n)] where Surj(m,n) is the set of surjections from a set having m elements to a set having n elements. We make explicit the action of symmetric groups on these groups and the Yoneda and external products. We deduce from these computations those of rational Ext-groups for functors of the form F \circ \mathfrak{a} where F is a symmetric or an exterior power functor. Combining these computations with a recent result of Djament we obtain explicit computations of stable homology of automorphism groups of free groups with coefficients given by particular contravariant functors.
