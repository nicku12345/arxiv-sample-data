We prove two results on the tube algebras of rigid C^*-tensor categories. The first is that the tube algebra of the representation category of a compact quantum group G is a full corner of the Drinfeld double of G. As an application we obtain some information on the structure of the tube algebras of the Temperley-Lieb categories TL(d) for d>2. The second result is that the tube algebras of weakly Morita equivalent C^*-tensor categories are strongly Morita equivalent. The corresponding linking algebra is described as the tube algebra of the 2-category defining the Morita context.
