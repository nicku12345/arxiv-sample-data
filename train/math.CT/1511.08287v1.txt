The Verdier quotient \mathcal{T}/\mathcal{S} of a triangulated category \mathcal{T} by a triangulated subcategory \mathcal{S} is defined by a universal property with respect to triangulated functors out of \mathcal{T}. However, \mathcal{T}/\mathcal{S} is in fact a localization of \mathcal{T}, i.e., it is obtained from \mathcal{T} by formally inverting a class of morphisms. We establish the analogous result for small stable quasi-categories. As an application, we explore the compatibility of Verdier quotients with symmetric monoidal structures. In particular, we record a few useful elementary results on the quasi-categories associated with symmetric monoidal differential graded categories and derived categories of symmetric monoidal Abelian categories for which we were unable to locate proofs in the literature.
