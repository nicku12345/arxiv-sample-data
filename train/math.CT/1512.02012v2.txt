We study integral almost square-free modular categories; i.e., integral modular categories of Frobenius-Perron dimension p^nm, where p is a prime number, m is a square-free natural number and {\rm gcd}(p,m)=1. We prove that if n\leq 5 or m is prime with m<p then they are group-theoretical. This generalizes several results in the literature and gives a partial answer to the question posed by the first author and H. Tucker. As an application, we prove that an integral modular category whose Frobenius-Perron dimensions is odd and less than 1125 is group-theoretical.
