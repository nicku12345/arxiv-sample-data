In this article, we introduce the notion of {\it concentric twin cotorsion pair} on a triangulated category. This notion contains the notions of t-structure, cluster tilting subcategory, co-t-structure and functorally finite rigid subcategory as examples. Moreover, a recollement of triangulated categories can be regarded as a special case of concentric twin cotorsion pair.   To any concentric twin cotorsion pair, we associate a pretriangulated subquotient category. This enables us to give a simultaneous generalization of the Iyama-Yoshino reduction and the recollement of cotorsion pairs. This allows us to give a generalized mutation on a set of cotorsion pairs defined by the concentric twin cotorsion pair.
