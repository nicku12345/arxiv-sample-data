We construct an operad \mathrm{Phyl} whose operations are the edge-labelled trees used in phylogenetics. This operad is the coproduct of \mathrm{Com}, the operad for commutative semigroups, and [0,\infty), the operad with unary operations corresponding to nonnegative real numbers, where composition is addition. We show that there is a homeomorphism between the space of n-ary operations of \mathrm{Phyl} and \mathcal{T}_n\times [0,\infty)^{n+1}, where \mathcal{T}_n is the space of metric n-trees introduced by Billera, Holmes and Vogtmann. Furthermore, we show that the Markov models used to reconstruct phylogenetic trees from genome data give coalgebras of \mathrm{Phyl}. These always extend to coalgebras of the larger operad \mathrm{Com} + [0,\infty], since Markov processes on finite sets converge to an equilibrium as time approaches infinity. We show that for any operad O, its coproduct with [0,\infty] contains the operad W(O) constucted by Boardman and Vogt. To prove these results, we explicitly describe the coproduct of operads in terms of labelled trees.
