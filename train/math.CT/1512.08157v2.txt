We introduce (partially) ordered Grothendieck categories and apply results on their structure to the study of categories of representations of the Mackey Lie algebra of infinite matrices \mathfrak{gl}^M\left(V,V_*\right). Here \mathfrak{gl}^M\left(V,V_*\right) is the Lie algebra of endomorphisms of a nondegenerate pairing of countably infinite-dimensional vector spaces V_*\otimes V\to\mathbb{K}, where \mathbb{K} is the base field. Tensor representations of \mathfrak{gl}^M\left(V,V_*\right) are defined as arbitrary subquotients of finite direct sums of tensor products (V^*)^{\otimes m}\otimes (V_*)^{\otimes n}\otimes V^{\otimes p} where V^* denotes the algebraic dual of V. The category \mathbb{T}^3_{\mathfrak{gl}^M\left(V,V_*\right)} which they comprise, extends a category \mathbb{T}_{\mathfrak{gl}^M\left(V,V_*\right)} previously studied in [4, 12,17], and our main result is that \mathbb{T}^3_{\mathfrak{gl}^M\left(V,V_*\right)} is a finite-length, Koszul self-dual, tensor category with a certain universal property that makes it into a "categorified algebra" defined by means of a handful of generators and relations. This result uses essentially the general properties of ordered Grothendieck categories, which yield also simpler proofs of some facts about the category \mathbb{T}_{\mathfrak{gl}^M\left(V,V_*\right)} established in [12]. Finally, we discuss the extension of \mathbb{T}^3_{\mathfrak{gl}^M\left(V,V_*\right)} by the algebraic dual (V_*)^* of V_*.
