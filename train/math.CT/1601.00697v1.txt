We show that for a Heyting algebra {\cal H}, a relational-presheaf is an idempotent symmetric order-preserving lax-semifunctor. A relational-presheaf is a relational-sheaf, if it is an idempotent infima-preserving lax semifunctor. The associated relational-sheaf functor factors through the category of sheaves for {\cal H}. Using this and the appropriate comparison theorems we obtain the main result that the associated categories of relational-presheaves and relational-sheaves are each respectively equivalent to the categories of presheaves and sheaves for {\cal H}.
