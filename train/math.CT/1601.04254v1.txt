In this paper we revisit Rota's Classification Problem on classifying algebraic identities for linear operator. We reformulate Rota's Classification Problem in the contexts of rewriting systems and Gr\"obner-Shirshov bases, through which Rota's Classification Problem amounts to the classification of operators, given by their defining operator identities, that give convergent rewriting systems or Gr\"obner-Shirshov bases. Relationship is established between the reformulations in terms of rewriting systems and that of Gr\"obner-Shirshov bases. We provide an effective condition that gives Gr\"obner-Shirshov operators and obtain a new class of Gr\"obner-Shirshov operators.
