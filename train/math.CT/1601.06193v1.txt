In this article, we will show that the category of biset functors can be regarded as a reflective monoidal subcategory of the category of Mackey functors on the 2-category of finite groupoids. This reflective subcategory is equivalent to the category of modules over the Burnside functor. As a consequence of the reflectivity, we can associate a biset functor to any derivator on the 2-category of finite categories.
