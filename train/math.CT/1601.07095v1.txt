In this paper we define the notions of normal subcrossed module and quotient crossed module within groups with operations; and using the equivalence of crossed modules over groups with operations and internal groupoids we prove how normality and quotient concepts are related in these two categories. Further we prove an equivalence of crossed modules over groups with operations and cat^1-groups with operations for a certain algebraic category; and then by this equivalence we determine normal and quotient objects in the category of cat^{1}-groups with operations. Finally we characterize the coverings of cat^{1}-groups with operations.
