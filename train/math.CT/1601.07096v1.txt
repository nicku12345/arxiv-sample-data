The aim of this paper is to define the notion of lifting of a crossed module via a group morphism and give some properties of this type of the lifting. Further we obtain a criterion for a crossed module to have a lifting of crossed module. We also prove that the liftings of a certain crossed module constitute a category; and that this category is equivalent to the category of covers of that crossed module and hence to the category of group-groupoid actions of the corresponding groupoid to that crossed module.
