If X is a topological group, then its fundamental groupoid \pi_1X is a group-groupoid which is a group object in the category of groupoids. Further if X is a path connected topological group which has a simply connected cover, then the category of covering spaces of X and the category of covering groupoids of \pi_1X are equivalent. In this paper we prove that if (X,x_0) is an H-group, then the fundamental groupoid \pi_1X is a categorical group. This enable us to prove that the category of the covering spaces of an H-group (X,x_0) is equivalent to the category of covering groupoid of the categorical group \pi_1X.
