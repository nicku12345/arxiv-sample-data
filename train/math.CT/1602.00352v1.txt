Let F be the category with the set of objects \bf N and morphisms being the functions between the standard finite sets of the corresponding cardinalities. Let Jf:F\rightarrow Sets be the obvious functor from this category to the category of sets. In this paper we construct, for any relative monad \bf RR on Jf and a left module \bf LM over \bf RR, a C-system C({\bf RR},{\bf LM}) and explicitly compute the action of the B-system operations on its B-sets.   In the following paper it is used to provide a rigorous mathematical approach to the construction of the C-systems underlying the term models of a wide class of dependent type theories.   This paper is a result of evolution of arXiv:1407.3394. However this paper is much more detailed and contains a lot of material that is not contained in arXiv:1407.3394. It also does not cover some material that is covered in arXiv:1407.3394.
