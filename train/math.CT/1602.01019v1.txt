We provide a precise description, albeit in the situation of standard categories, of the quantization functor Sum proposed by D.S. Freed, M.J. Hopkins, J. Lurie, and C. Teleman in a way enough abstract and flexible to suggest that an extension of the construction to the general context of higher categories should indeed be possible. Our method is in fact based primarily on dualizability and adjunction data, and is well suited for the homotopical setting. The construction also sheds light on the need of certain rescaling automorphisms, and in particular on the nature and properties of the Nakayama isomorphism.
