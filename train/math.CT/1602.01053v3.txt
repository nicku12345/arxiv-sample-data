Let {\widetilde {\mathcal O}}(\mathbf B) be the category of (open) subcategories of a topological groupoid {\mathbf B}. This paper concerns with the {\mathbf {Cat}}-valued sheaves over category {\widetilde {\mathcal O}}(\mathbf B). Since {\mathbf {Cat}} is not a concrete category, traditional definition of presheaf can not deal with the situation. [13] proposes a new framework for the purpose. Starting from the definition given in [13], we build-up the frame work for {\mathbf {Cat}}-valued sheaves. For that purpose we introduce a notion of categorical union, such that categorical union of subcategories is a subcategory, which is required for a meaningful definition of a categorical cover of a topological category. The main result is the following. For a fixed category \mathbf C, the categories of local functorial sections from \mathbf B to \mathbf C define a {\mathbf {Cat}}-valued sheaf on {\widetilde {\mathcal O}}(\mathbf B). Replacing \mathbf C with a categorical group \mathcal G, we find a {\mathbf {CatGrp}}-valued sheaf on {\widetilde {\mathcal O}}(\mathbf B).
