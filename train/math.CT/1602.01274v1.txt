For a small simplicial category A, we prove that the homotopy colimit functor from the category of simplicial diagrams on A to the category of simplicial sets over the homotopy-coherent nerve of A provides a left Quillen equivalence between the projective model structure on the former category and the covariant model structure on the latter. We compare this Quillen equivalence to the straightening-unstraightening equivalence previously established by Lurie, where the left adjoint goes in the opposite direction. The existence of left Quillen functors in both directions considerably simplifies the proof that these constructions provide Quillen equivalences. The results of this paper generalize those of part I, where A was an ordinary category. The proofs for a simplicial category are more involved and can be read independently.
