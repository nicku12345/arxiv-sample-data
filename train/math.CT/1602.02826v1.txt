Axiomatic Cohesion proposes that the contrast between cohesion and non-cohesion may be expressed by means of a geometric morphism p :\mathcal{E} \to \mathcal {S} (between toposes) with certain special properties that allow to effectively use the intuition that the objects of \mathcal{E} are `spaces' and those of \mathcal{S} are `sets'. Such geometric morphisms are called (pre-)cohesive. We may also say that \mathcal{E} is pre-cohesive (over \mathcal{S}). In this case, the topos \mathcal{E} determines an \mathcal{S}-enriched `homotopy' category. The purpose of the present paper is to study certain aspects of this homotopy theory. We introduce weakly Kan objects in a pre-cohesive topos, which are analogous to Kan complexes in the topos of simplicial sets. Also, given a geometric morphism g:\mathcal{F} \to\mathcal{E} between pre-cohesive toposes \mathcal{F} and \mathcal{E} (over the same base), we define what it means for g to preserve pieces. We prove that if g preserves pieces then it induces an adjunction between the homotopy categories determined by \mathcal{F} and \mathcal{E}, and that the direct image g_*:\mathcal{F}\to \mathcal{E} preserves weakly Kan objects. These and other results support the intuition that the inverse image of g is `geometric realization'. In particular, since Kan complexes are weakly Kan in the pre-cohesive topos of simplicial sets, the result relating g and weakly Kan objects is analogous to the fact that the singular complex of a space is a Kan complex.
