In this paper, we consider categories with colored morphisms and functors such that morphisms assigned to morphisms with a common color have a common color. In this paper, we construct a morphism-colored functor such that any morphism-colored functor from a given small morphism-colored groupoid to any discrete morphism-colored category factors through it. We also apply the main result to a schemoid constructed from a Hamming scheme.
