By homotopy linear algebra we mean the study of linear functors between slices of the \infty-category of \infty-groupoids, subject to certain finiteness conditions. After some standard definitions and results, we assemble said slices into \infty-categories to model the duality between vector spaces and profinite-dimensional vector spaces, and set up a global notion of homotopy cardinality \`a la Baez-Hoffnung-Walker compatible with this duality. We needed these results to support our work on incidence algebras and M\"obius inversion over \infty-groupoids; we hope that they can also be of independent interest.
