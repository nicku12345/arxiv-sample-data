The invertibility hypothesis for a monoidal model category S asks that localizing an S-enriched category with respect to an equivalence results in an weakly equivalent enriched category. This is the most technical among the axioms for S to be an excellent model category in the sense of Lurie, who showed that the category of S-enriched categories then has a model structure with characterizable fibrant objects. We use a universal property of cubical sets, as a monoidal model category, to show that the invertibility hypothesis is consequence of the other axioms.
