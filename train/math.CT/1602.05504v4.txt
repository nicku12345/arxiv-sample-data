Given a partial action \theta of a group on a set with an algebraic structure, we construct a reflector of \theta in the corresponding subcategory of global actions and study the question when this reflector is a globalization. In particular, if \theta is a partial action on an algebra from a variety {\sf V}, then we show that the problem reduces to the embeddability of certain generalized amalgam of {\sf V}-algebras associated with \theta. As an application, we describe globalizable partial actions on semigroups, whose domains are ideals.
