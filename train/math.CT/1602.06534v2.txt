For a braided finite tensor category \mathcal{C} with unit object 1 \in \mathcal{C}, Lyubashenko considered a certain Hopf algebra \mathbb{F} \in \mathcal{C} endowed with a Hopf pairing \omega: \mathbb{F} \otimes \mathbb{F} \to 1 to define the notion of a `non-semisimple' modular tensor category. We say that \mathcal{C} is non-degenerate if the Hopf pairing \omega is non-degenerate. In this paper, we show that \mathcal{C} is non-degenerate if and only if it is factorizable in the sense of Etingof, Nikshych and Ostrik, if and only if its M\"uger center is trivial, if and only if the linear map \Omega: \mathrm{Hom}_{\mathcal{C}}(1, \mathbb{F}) \to \mathrm{Hom}_{\mathcal{C}}(\mathbb{F}, 1) induced by the pairing \omega is invertible. As an application, we prove that the category of Yetter-Drinfeld modules over a Hopf algebra in \mathcal{C} is non-degenerate if and only if \mathcal{C} is.
