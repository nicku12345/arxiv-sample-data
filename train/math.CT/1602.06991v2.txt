In this paper, we characterise metric spaces which have topologically connected Higson coronas. The characterisation is given by a natural categorical condition applied in the coarse category. We also give a characterisation in terms of coarse cohomology, and consider the special case of finitely generated groups and the more general case of abstract coarse spaces. Along the way, we exhibit some connections to the notion of \omega-excisive decomposition introduced by Higson, Roe and Yu, and give a categorical characterisation of such decompositions.
