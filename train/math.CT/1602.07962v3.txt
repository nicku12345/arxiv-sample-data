A short introduction to Grothendieck weak omega-groupoids is given. Our aim is to give evidence that, in certain contexts, this simple language is a convenient one for constructing globular weak omega-groupoids. To this end, we give a short reworking of van den Berg and Garner's construction of a Batanin weak omega-groupoid from a type using the language of Grothendieck weak omega-groupoids.
