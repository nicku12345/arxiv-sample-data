A schemoid is a generalization of association schemes from the point of view of small categories. In this article, we discuss schemoid structures for two kinds of small categories; the canonical small category defined by a poset, and another small category which arises a poset. We also discuss the schemoid algebra, that is an analogue of the Bose--Mesner algebra for an association scheme, for them.
