Let \mathcal C be a category of a set of (small) categories. This paper concerns with the {\mathbf {Cat}}-valued presheaves and sieves over category \mathcal C. Since {\mathbf {Cat}} is not a concrete category, existing definition of presheaves can not deal with the situation. This paper proposes a new framework for the purpose. The main result is a version of Yoneda embedding for {\mathbf {Cat}}-valued presheaves, and construction of the {\mathbf {Cat}}-valued sieves over the category {\mathcal O}(\mathbf B) of subcategories of a given topological category \mathbf B.
