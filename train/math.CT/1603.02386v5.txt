We study cocompleteness, co-wellpoweredness and generators in the centralizer category of an object or morphism in a monoidal category, and the center or the weak center of a monoidal category. We explicitly give some answers for when colimits, cocompleteness, co-wellpoweredness and generators in these monoidal categories can be inherited from their base monidal categories. Most importantly, we investigate cofree objects of comonoids in these monoidal categories.
