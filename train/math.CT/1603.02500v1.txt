We introduce the notion of \lambda-equivalence and \lambda-embeddings of objects in suitable categories. This notion specializes to L_{\infty\lambda}-equivalence and L_{\infty\lambda}-elementary embedding for categories of structures in a language of arity less than \lambda, and interacts well with functors and \lambda-directed colimits. We recover and extend results of Feferman and Eklof on "local functors" without fixing a language in advance. This is convenient for formalizing Lefschetz's principle in algebraic geometry, which was one of the main applications of the work of Eklof.
