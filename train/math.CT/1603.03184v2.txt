By an odd structure we mean an algebraic structure in the category of graded vector spaces whose structure operations have odd degrees. Particularly important are odd modular operads which appear as Feynman transforms of modular operads and, as such, describe some structures of string field theory.   We will explain how odd structures are affected by the choice of the monoidal structure of the underlying category. We will then present two `natural' and `canonical' constructions of an odd modular endomorphism operad leading to different results, only one being correct. This contradicts the generally accepted belief that the systematic use of the Koszul sign convention leads to correct signs.
