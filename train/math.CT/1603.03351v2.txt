Certain axiomatic notions of \textit{affine space} over a ring and \textit{convex space} over a preordered ring are examples of the notion of \mathcal{T}-algebra for an algebraic theory \mathcal{T} in the sense of Lawvere. Herein we study the notion of \textit{commutant} for Lawvere theories that was defined by Wraith and generalizes the notion of \textit{centralizer clone}. We focus on the Lawvere theory of \textit{left R-affine spaces} for a ring or rig R, proving that this theory can be described as a commutant of the theory of pointed right R-modules. Further, we show that for a wide class of rigs R that includes all rings, these theories are commutants of one another in the full finitary theory of R in the category of sets. We define \textit{left R-convex spaces} for a preordered ring R as left affine spaces over the positive part R_+ of R. We show that for any \textit{firmly archimedean} preordered algebra R over the dyadic rationals, the theories of left R-convex spaces and pointed right R_+-modules are commutants of one another within the full finitary theory of R_+ in the category of sets. Applied to the ring of real numbers \mathbb{R}, this result shows that the connection between convex spaces and pointed \mathbb{R}_+-modules that is implicit in the integral representation of probability measures is a perfect `duality' of algebraic theories.
