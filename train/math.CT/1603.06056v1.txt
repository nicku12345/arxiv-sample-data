We study a structure of subcategories which are called a polygon of recollements in a triangulated category. First, we study a 2n-gon of recollements in an (m/n)-Calabi-Yau triangulated category. Second, we show the homotopy category \mathsf{K}(\mathsf{Mor}_{N-1}(\mathcal{B})) of complexes of an additive category \mathsf{Mor}_{N-1}(\mathcal{B}) of N-1 sequences of split monomorphisms of an additive category \mathcal{B} has a 2N-gon of recollments. Third, we show the homotopy category \mathsf{K}_{N}(\mathcal{B}) of N-complexes of \mathcal{B} has also a 2N-gon of recollments. Finally, we show there is a triangle equivalence between \mathsf{K}(\mathsf{Mor}_{N-1}(\mathcal{B})) and \mathsf{K}_{N}(\mathcal{B}).
