We define a notion of morphism for quotient vector bundles that yields both a category \textit{QVBun} and a contravariant global sections functor C:\textit{QVBun}^{\textrm{op}}\to\textit{Vect} whose restriction to trivial vector bundles with fiber F coincides with the contravariant functor \textit{Top}^{\textrm{op}}\to\textit{Vect} of F-valued continuous functions. Based on this we obtain a linear extension of the adjunction between the categories of topological spaces and locales: (i) a linearized topological space is a spectral vector bundle, by which is meant a mildly restricted type of quotient vector bundle; (ii) a linearized locale is a locale \triangle equipped with both a topological vector space A and a \triangle-valued support map for the elements of A satisfying a continuity condition relative to the spectrum of \triangle and the lower Vietoris topology on \operatorname{Sub} A; (iii) we obtain an adjunction between the full subcategory of spectral vector bundles \textit{QVBun}_{\Sigma} and the category of linearized locales \textit{LinLoc}, which restricts to an equivalence of categories between sober spectral vector bundles and spatial linearized locales. The spectral vector bundles are classified by a finer topology on \operatorname{Sub} A, called the open support topology, but there is no notion of universal spectral vector bundle for an arbitrary topological vector space A.
