This article consists of an interesting characterisation of a skew monoidale in the monoidal bicategory Span. After discussing the shift or decalage functor on simplicial sets we characterise these skew monoidales as categories \mathbb C together with a functor R \colon Dec(\mathbb C) \longrightarrow \mathbb C which satisfies two conditions and give an example where the unit of the skew monoidale is not of a restricted type.
