We extend the notion of the nerve of a category for a small class of crossed simplicial groups, explicitly describing them using generators and relations. We do this by first considering a generalised bar construction of a group before looking at twisted versions of some of these nerves. As an application we show how we can use the twisted nerves to give equivariant versions of certain derived stacks.
