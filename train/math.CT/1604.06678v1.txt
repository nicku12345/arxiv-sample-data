In this paper we study wall-crossing functors between categories of modules over quantizations of symplectic resolutions. We prove that wall-crossing functors through faces are perverse equivalences and use this to verify an Etingof type conjecture for quantizations of Nakajima quiver varieties associated to affine quivers. In the case when there is a Hamiltonian torus action on the resolution with finitely many fixed points so that it makes sense to speak about categories \mathcal{O} over quantizations, we introduce new standardly stratified structures on these categories \mathcal{O} and relate the wall-crossing functors to the Ringel duality functors associated to these standardly stratified structures.
