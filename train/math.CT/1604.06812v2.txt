In this paper we give sufficient conditions for lifting an enhanced factorization system  (\mathcal{E}, \mathcal{M})  on a  2 -category  \mathbf{D}  to the functor  2 -category  \mathbf{D}^{\mathbf{C}} , where  \mathbf{C}  is a small  2 -category. Due to previous work of Lack, our work provides coherence results for  2 -monads on functor  2 -categories. These coherence results are of immediate interest to an ongoing collaboration of Guillou, May, Merling, and Osorno on equivariant infinite loop space theory.
