In all finite Coxeter types but I_2(12), I_2(18) and I_2(30), we classify simple transitive 2-rep\-re\-sen\-ta\-ti\-ons for the quotient of the 2-category of Soergel bimodules over the coinvariant algebra which is associated to the two-sided cell that is the closest one to the two-sided cell containing the identity element. It turns out that, in most of the cases, simple transitive 2-representations are exhausted by cell 2-representations. However, in Coxeter types I_2(2k), where k\geq 3, there exist simple transitive 2-representations which are not equivalent to cell 2-representations.
