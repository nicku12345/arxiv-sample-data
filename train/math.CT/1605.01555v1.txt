It is proved that for any Grothendieck site X, there exists a coreflection (called \mathbf{cosheafification}) from the category of precosheaves on X with values in a category \mathbf{K}, to the full subcategory of cosheaves, provided either \mathbf{K} or \mathbf{K}^{op} is locally presentable. If \mathbf{K} is cocomplete, such a coreflection is built explicitly for the (pre)cosheaves with values in the category \mathbf{Pro}% \left( \mathbf{K}\right)  of pro-objects in \mathbf{K}. In the case of precosheaves on topological spaces, it is proved that any precosheaf with values in \mathbf{Pro}\left( \mathbf{K}\right)  is \mathbf{smooth}, i.e. is strongly locally isomorphic to a cosheaf. Constant cosheaves are constructed, and there are established connections with shape theory.
