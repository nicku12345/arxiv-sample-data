Starting from the symmetric group S_n, we construct two fiat 2-categories. One of them can be viewed as the fiat "extension" of the natural 2-category associated with the symmetric inverse semigroup (considered as an ordered semigroup with respect to the natural order). This 2-category provides a fiat categorification for the integral semigroup algebra of the symmetric inverse semigroup. The other 2-category can be viewed as the fiat "extension" of the 2-category associated with the maximal factorizable subsemigroup of the dual symmetric inverse semigroup (again, considered as an ordered semigroup with respect to the natural order). This 2-category provides a fiat categorification for the integral semigroup algebra of the maximal factorizable subsemigroup of the dual symmetric inverse semigroup.
