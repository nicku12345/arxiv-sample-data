We introduce a model structure on the category of graphs, which is Quillen equivalent to the category of \mathbb{Z}_2-spaces. A weak equivalence is a graph homomorphism which induces a \mathbb{Z}_2-homotopy equivalence between their box complexes. The box complex is a \mathbb{Z}_2-space associated to a graph, considered in the context of the graph coloring problem. In the proof, we discuss the universality problem of the Hom complex.
