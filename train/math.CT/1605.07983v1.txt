Let I be a small category, \mathcal{C} be the category \mathbf{Cat}, \mathbf{Ac} or \mathbf{Pos} of small categories, acyclic categories, or posets, respectively. Let \mathcal{O} be a locally small class of objects in \mathbf{Set}^I such that \mathrm{colim}_I O=* for every O\in \mathcal{O}. We prove that \mathcal{C}^I admits the \mathcal{O}-equivariant model structure in the sense of Farjoun, and that it is Quillen equivalent to the \mathcal{O}-equivariant model structure on \mathbf{sSet}^I. This generalizes previous results of Bohmann-Mazur-Osorno-Ozornova-Ponto-Yarnall and of May-Stephan-Zakharevich when I=G is a discrete group and \mathcal{O} is the set of orbits of G.
