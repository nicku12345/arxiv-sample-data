This paper is a sequel to arXiv:1503.05523 and arXiv:1605.03934. We extend the classical Harrison-Matlis module category equivalences to a triangulated equivalence between the derived categories of the abelian categories of torsion modules and contramodules over a Matlis domain. This generalizes to the case of any commutative ring R with a fixed multiplicative system S such that the R-module S^{-1}R has projective dimension 1. The latter equivalence connects complexes of R-modules with S-torsion and S-contramodule cohomology modules. It takes a nicer form of an equivalence between the derived categories of abelian categories when S consists of nonzero-divisors or the S-torsion in R is bounded.
