If \mathbf{C} is a category with pullbacks then there is a bicategory with the same objects as \mathbf{C}, spans as morphisms, and maps of spans as 2-morphisms, as shown by Benabou. Fong has developed a theory of "decorated" cospans, which are cospans in \mathbf{C} equipped with extra structure. This extra structure arises from a lax symmetric monoidal functor F \colon \mathbf{C} \to \mathbf{D}; we use this functor to "decorate" each cospan with apex N \in \mathbf{C} with an element of F(N). Using a result of Shulman, we show that when \mathbf{C} has finite colimits, decorated cospans are morphisms in a symmetric monoidal bicategory. We illustrate our construction with examples from electrical engineering and the theory of chemical reaction networks.
