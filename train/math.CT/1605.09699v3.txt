In this paper we introduce a notion of Mal'tsev object, and the dual notion of co-Mal'tsev object, in a general category. In particular, a category \mathbb{C} is a Mal'tsev category if and only if every object in \mathbb{C} is a Mal'tsev object. We show that for a well-powered regular category \mathbb{C} which admits coproducts, the full subcategory of Mal'tsev objects is coreflective in \mathbb{C}. We show that the co-Mal'tsev objects in the category of topological spaces and continuous maps are precisely the R_1-spaces, and that the co-Mal'tsev objects in the category of metric spaces and short maps are precisely the ultrametric spaces.
