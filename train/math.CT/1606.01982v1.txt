We consider nonsymmetric operads with two binary operations satisfying relations in arity 3; hence these operads are quadratic, and so we can investigate Koszul duality. We first consider operations which are nonassociative (not necessarily associative) and then specialize to the associative case. We obtain a complete classification of self-dual quadratic nonsymmetric operads with two (associative or nonassociative) binary operations. These operads generalize associativity for one operation to the setting of two operations.
