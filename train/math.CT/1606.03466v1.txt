We describe how the study of superfusion categories (roughly speaking, fusion categories enriched over the category of super vector spaces) reduces to that of fusion categories over sVect, in the sense of Drinfeld, Gelaki, Nikshych, and Ostrik. Following Brundan and Ellis, we give the construction of the underlying fusion category of a superfusion category, and give an explicit formula for the associator in this category in terms of 6j-symbols. We give a definition of the \pi-Grothendieck ring of a superfusion category, and prove a version of Ocneanu rigidity for superfusion categories.
