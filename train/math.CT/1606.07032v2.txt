Picard 2-categories are symmetric monoidal 2-categories with invertible 0-, 1-, and 2-cells. The classifying space of a Picard 2-category \mathcal{D} is an infinite loop space, the zeroth space of the K-theory spectrum K\mathcal{D}. This spectrum has stable homotopy groups concentrated in levels 0, 1, and 2. In this paper, we describe part of the Postnikov data of K\mathcal{D} in terms of categorical structure. We use this to show that there is no strict skeletal Picard 2-category whose K-theory realizes the 2-truncation of the sphere spectrum. As part of the proof, we construct a categorical suspension, producing a Picard 2-category \Sigma C from a Picard 1-category C, and show that it commutes with K-theory in that K\Sigma C is stably equivalent to \Sigma K C.
