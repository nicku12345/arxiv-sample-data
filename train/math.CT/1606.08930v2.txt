It is well known that a relation \varphi between sets is regular if, and only if, \mathcal{K}\varphi is completely distributive (cd), where \mathcal{K}\varphi is the complete lattice consisting of fixed points of the Kan adjunction induced by \varphi. For a small quantaloid \mathcal{Q}, we investigate the \mathcal{Q}-enriched version of this classical result, i.e., the regularity of \mathcal{Q}-distributors versus the constructive complete distributivity (ccd) of \mathcal{Q}-categories, and prove that "the dual of \mathcal{K}\varphi is (ccd) \implies \varphi is regular \implies \mathcal{K}\varphi is (ccd)" for any \mathcal{Q}-distributor \varphi. Although the converse implications do not hold in general, in the case that \mathcal{Q} is a commutative integral quantale, we show that these three statements are equivalent for any \varphi if, and only if, \mathcal{Q} is a Girard quantale.
