Guided by the microcosm principle of Baez-Dolan and by the algebraic definitions of operads of Kelly and Fiore, we introduce two "monoid-like" definitions of cyclic operads, one for the original, "exchangable-output" characterisation of Getzler-Kapranov, and the other for the alternative "entries-only" characterisation, both within the category of Joyal's species of structures. Relying on a result of Lamarche on descent for species, we use these "monoid-like" definitions to prove the equivalence between the "exchangable-output" and "entries-only" points of view on cyclic operads.
