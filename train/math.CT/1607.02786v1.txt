Effective Burnside \infty-categories are the centerpiece of the \infty-categorical approach to equivariant stable homotopy theory. In this \'etude, we recall the construction of the twisted arrow \infty-category, and we give a new proof that it is an \infty-category, using an extremely helpful modification of an argument due to Joyal--Tierney. The twisted arrow \infty-category is in turn used to construct the effective Burnside \infty-category. We employ a variation on this theme to construct a fibrewise effective Burnside \infty-category. To show that this constuctionworks fibrewise, we introduce a fragment of a theory of what we call marbled simplicial sets, and we use a yet further modified form of the Joyal--Tierney argument.
