This paper is based on the material of Section 4 and Appendix C in arXiv:1503.05523v6, which was excluded from the subsequent versions of arXiv:1503.05523. We present the definition of a dedualizing complex of bicomodules over a pair of cocoherent coassociative coalgebras \mathcal C and \mathcal D. Given such a complex \mathcal B^\bullet, we construct an equivalence between the (bounded or unbounded) conventional, as well as absolute, derived categories of the abelian categories of left comodules over \mathcal C and left contramodules over \mathcal D. Furthermore, we spell out the definition of a dedualizing complex of bisemimodules over a pair of semialgebras, and construct the related equivalence between the conventional or absolute derived categories of the abelian categories of semimodules and semicontramodules. Artinian, co-Noetherian, and cocoherent coalgebras are discussed as a preliminary material.
