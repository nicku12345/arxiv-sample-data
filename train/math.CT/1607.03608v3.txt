We define a tensor product of linear sites, and a resulting tensor product of Grothendieck categories based upon their representations as categories of linear sheaves. We show that our tensor product is a special case of the tensor product of locally presentable linear categories, and that the tensor product of locally coherent Grothendieck categories is locally coherent if and only if the Deligne tensor product of their abelian categories of finitely presented objects exists. We describe the tensor product of non-commutative projective schemes in terms of Z-algebras, and show that for projective schemes our tensor product corresponds to the usual product scheme.
