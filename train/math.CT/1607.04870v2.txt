We introduce a new class of higher categorical structures called weakly globular Tamsamani n-categories. These generalize the Tamsamani-Simpson model of higher categories by using the new paradigm of weak globularity to weaken higher categorical structures. We prove this new structure is suitably equivalent to a simpler one previously introduced by the author, called weakly globular n-fold categories.
