We prove that the theory of representations of a finite 2-group \mathbb{G} in Baez-Crans 2-vector spaces over a field k of characteristic zero essentially reduces to the theory of k-linear representations of the group of isomorphism classes of objects of \mathbb{G}, the remaining homotopy invariants of \mathbb{G} playing no role. It is also argued that a similar result is expected to hold for topological representations of compact topological 2-groups in suitable topological Baez-Crans 2-vector spaces.
