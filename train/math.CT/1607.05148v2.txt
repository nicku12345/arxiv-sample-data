We explicitly show that symmetric Frobenius structures on a finite-dimensional, semi-simple algebra stand in bijection to homotopy fixed points of the trivial SO(2)-action on the bicategory of finite-dimensional, semi-simple algebras, bimodules and intertwiners. The results are motivated by the 2-dimensional Cobordism Hypothesis for oriented manifolds, and can hence be interpreted in the realm of Topological Quantum Field Theory.
