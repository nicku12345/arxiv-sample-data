Given a symmetric monoidal (\infty,2)-category \mathscr E we promote the trace construction to a functor. We then apply this formalism to the case when \mathscr{E} is the (\infty,2)-category of k-linear presentable categories which in combination of various calculations in the setting of derived algebraic geometry gives a categorical proof of the classical Atiyah-Bott formula (also known as the Holomorphic Lefschetz fixed point formula).
