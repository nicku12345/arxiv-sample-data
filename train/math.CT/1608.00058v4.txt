This paper discusses some issues arising from the category \mathfrak{H} of hypergraphs, the category \mathfrak{M} of (undirected) multigraphs, and the topos \mathfrak{Q} of quivers. First, the natural inclusion of \mathfrak{M} into \mathfrak{H} admits a right adjoint functor by deleting all nontraditional edges. Dually, the operations of taking the underlying multigraph of a quiver and taking the associated digraph of a multigraph form an adjoint pair between \mathfrak{M} and \mathfrak{Q}.   On the other hand, neither \mathfrak{H} nor \mathfrak{M} is cartesian closed, meaning that neither is a topos like \mathfrak{Q}. Moreover, despite \mathfrak{M} being a subcategory of \mathfrak{H}, \mathfrak{H} does not have enough projective objects while \mathfrak{M} admits a projective cover for every object.
