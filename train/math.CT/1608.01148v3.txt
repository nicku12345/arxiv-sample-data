Given a symmetric monoidal stable \infty-category \mathcal{C} and a left adjoint symmetric monoidal fiber functor to \operatorname{Mod}_A^{\otimes} for some \mathbb{E}_{\infty}-ring A, one can construct a derived group scheme G of monoidal automorphisms of this functor. The left adjoint fiber functor also induces a monad on \mathcal{C}. Under some finiteness hypothesis on the fiber functor, we show there is a comparison functor from the category of representations of G to the descent category of the induced monad on \mathcal{C}.
