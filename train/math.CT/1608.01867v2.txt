Over suitable monoidal model categories, we construct a Dwyer-Kan model category structure on the category of algebras over an augmented operadic collection. As examples we obtain Dwyer-Kan model category structure on the categories of enriched wheeled props, wheeled properads, and wheeled operads, among others. This result extends known model category structure on the categories of operads, properads, and props enriched in simplicial sets and other monoidal model categories. We also show that our Dwyer-Kan model category structure is well behaved with respect to simultaneous changes of the underlying monoidal model category and the augmented operadic collection.
