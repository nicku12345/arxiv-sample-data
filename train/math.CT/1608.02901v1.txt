We construct for every \infty-operad \mathcal{O}^\otimes with certain finite limits new \infty-operads of spectrum objects and of commutative group objects in \mathcal{O}. We show that these are the universal stable resp. additive \infty-operads obtained from \mathcal{O}^\otimes. We deduce that for a stably (resp. additively) symmetric monoidal \infty-category \mathcal{C} the Yoneda embedding factors through the \infty-category of exact, contravariant functors from \mathcal{C} to the \infty-category of spectra (resp. connective spectra) and admits a certain multiplicative refinement. As an application we prove that the identity functor Sp \to Sp is initial among exact, lax symmetric monoidal endofunctors of the symmetric monoidal \infty-category Sp of spectra with smash product.
