In a locally \lambda-presentable category, with \lambda a regular cardinal, classes of objects that are injective with respect to a family of morphisms whose domains and codomains are \lambda-presentable, are known to be characterized by their closure under products, \lambda-directed colimits and \lambda-pure subobjects. Replacing the strict commutativity of diagrams by "commutativity up to \varepsilon", this paper provides an "approximate version" of this characterization for categories enriched over metric spaces. It entails a detailed discussion of the needed \varepsilon-generalizations of the notion of \lambda-purity. The categorical theory is being applied to the locally \aleph_1-presentable category of Banach spaces and their linear operators of norm at most 1, culminating in a largely categorical proof for the existence of the so-called Gurarii Banach space.
