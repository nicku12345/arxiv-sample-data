In this paper we will prove that the \mbox{A}_{\infty}-nerve of two quasi-equivalent \mbox{A}_{\infty}-categories are weak-equivalent in the Joyal model structure, a consequence of this fact is that the \mbox{A}_{\infty}-nerve of a pretriangulated \mbox{A}_{\infty}-category is \infty-stable. Moreover we give a comparison between the notions of pretriangulated \mbox{A}_{\infty}-categories, pretriangulated dg-categories and \infty-stable categories.
