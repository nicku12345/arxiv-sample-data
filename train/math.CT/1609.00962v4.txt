In this paper we complete the \mathrm{ADE}-like classification of simple transitive 2-representations of Soergel bimodules in finite dihedral type, under the assumption of gradeability. In particular, we use bipartite graphs and zigzag algebras of \mathrm{ADE} type to give an explicit construction of a graded (non-strict) version of all these 2-representations.   Moreover, we give simple combinatorial criteria for when two such 2-representations are equivalent and for when their Grothendieck groups give rise to isomorphic representations.   Finally, our construction also gives a large class of simple transitive 2-representations in infinite dihedral type for general bipartite graphs.
