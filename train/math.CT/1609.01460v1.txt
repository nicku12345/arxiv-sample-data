We construct finite coherent presentations of plactic monoids of type A. Such coherent presentations express a system of generators and relations for the monoid extended in a coherent way to give a family of generators of the relations amongst the relations. Such extended presentations are used for representations of monoids, in particular, it is a way to describe actions of monoids on categories. Moreover, a coherent presentation provides the first step in the computation of a categorical cofibrant replacement of a monoid. Our construction is based on a rewriting method introduced by Squier that computes a coherent presentation from a convergent one. We compute a finite coherent presentation of a plactic monoid from its column presentation that is known to be finite and convergent. Finally, we show how to reduce this coherent presentation to a Tietze equivalent one having Knuth's generators.
