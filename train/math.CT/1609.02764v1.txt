Absolute Universes of combinatorial games, as defined in a recent paper by the same authors, include many standard short normal- mis\`ere- and scoring-play monoids. In this note we show that the class is categorical, by extending Joyal's construction of arrows in normal-play games. Given G and H in an Absolute Universe U, we study instead the Left Provisonal Game [G, H], which is a normal-play game, independently of the particular Absolute Universe, and find that G\longrightarrow H (implying G\succcurlyeq H) corresponds to the set of winning strategies for Left playing second in [G,H]. By this we define the category {\bf LNP(U)}.
