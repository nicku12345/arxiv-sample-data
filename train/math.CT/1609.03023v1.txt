In this paper we generalize Tannakian formalism to fiber functors over general tensor categories. We will show that (under some technical conditions) if the fiber functor has a section, then the source category is equivalent to the category of comodules over a Hopf algebra in the target category. We will also give a description of this Hopf algebra using the notion of framed objects.
