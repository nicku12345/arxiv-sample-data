For a small quantaloid \mathcal{Q}, we consider 2-monads on the 2-category \mathcal{Q}-\bf{Cat} and their lax extensions to the 2-category \mathcal{Q}-\bf{Dist} of small \mathcal{Q}-categories and their distributors, in particular those lax extensions that are flat, in the sense that they map identity distributors to identity distributors. In fact, unlike in the discrete case, a 2-monad on \mathcal{Q}-\bf{Cat} may admit only one flat lax extension. Every ordinary monad on the comma category \bf{Set}/{\rm ob}\mathcal{Q} with a lax extension to \mathcal{Q}-\bf{Rel} gives rise to such a 2-monad on \mathcal{Q}-\bf{Cat}, and we describe this process globally as a coreflective embedding. The \mathcal{Q}-presheaf and the double \mathcal{Q}-presheaf monads are important examples of 2-monads on \mathcal{Q}-\bf{Cat} allowing flat lax extensions to \mathcal{Q}-\bf{Dist}, and so are their submonads, obtained by the restriction to conical (co)presheaves and known as the \mathcal{Q}-Hausdorff and double \mathcal{Q}-Hausdorff monads, which we define here in full generality, thus generalizing some previous work in the case when \mathcal{Q} is a quantale, or just the "metric" quantale [0,\infty]. Their discretization leads naturally to various lax extensions of the relevant \bf{Set}-monads used in monoidal topology.
