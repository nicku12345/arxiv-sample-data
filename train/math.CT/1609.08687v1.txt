Racks and quandles are rich algebraic structures that are strong enough to classify knots. Here we develop several fundamental categorical aspects of the theories of racks and quandles and their relation to the theory of permutations. In particular, we compute the centers of the categories and describe power operations on them, thereby revealing free extra structure that is not apparent from the definitions. This also leads to precise characterizations of these theories in the form of universal properties.
