In this invited talk, I will review five basic concepts of Axiomatic Rewriting Theory, an axiomatic and diagrammatic theory of rewriting started 25 years ago in a LICS paper with Georges Gonthier and Jean-Jacques L\'evy, and developed along the subsequent years into a full-fledged 2-dimensional theory of causality and residuation in rewriting. I will give a contemporary view on the theory, informed by my later work on categorical semantics and higher-dimensional algebra, and also indicate a number of current research directions in the field.
