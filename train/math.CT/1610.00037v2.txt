We construct a left semi-model structure on the category of intensional type theories (precisely, on \mathrm{CxlCat_{Id,1,\Sigma(,\Pi_{ext})}}). This presents an \infty-category of such type theories; we show moreover that there is an \infty-functor \mathrm{Cl}_\infty from there to the \infty-category of suitably structured quasi-categories.   This allows a precise formulation of the conjectures that intensional type theory gives internal languages for higher categories, and provides a framework and toolbox for further progress on these conjectures.
