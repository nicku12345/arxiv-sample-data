We prove that the classical result asserting that the relative Picard group of a faithfully flat extension of commutative rings is isomorphic to the first Amitsur cohomology group stills valid in the realm of symmetric monoidal categories. To this end, we built some group exact sequences from an adjunction in a bicategory, which are of independent interest. As a particular byproduct of the evolving theory, we prove a version of Hilbert's theorem 90 for cocommutatvie coalgebra coextensions (=surjective homomorphisms).
