Given a 2-category \mathcal{A}, a 2-functor \mathcal{A} \overset {F} {\longrightarrow} \mathcal{C}at and a distinguished 1-subcategory \Sigma \subset \mathcal{A} containing all the objects, a \sigma-cone for F (with respect to \Sigma) is a lax cone such that the structural 2-cells corresponding to the arrows of \Sigma are invertible. The conical \sigma-limit is the universal (up to isomorphism) \sigma-cone. The notion of \sigma-limit generalises the well known notions of pseudo and lax limit. We consider the fundamental notion of \sigma-filtered} pair (\mathcal{A}, \, \Sigma) which generalises the notion of 2-filtered 2-category. We give an explicit construction of \sigma-filtered \sigma-colimits of categories, construction which allows computations with these colimits. We then state and prove a basic exactness property of the 2-category of categories, namely, that \sigma-filtered \sigma-colimits commute with finite weighted pseudo (or bi) limits. An important corollary of this result is that a \sigma-filtered \sigma-colimit of exact category valued 2-functors is exact. This corollary is essential in the 2-dimensional theory of flat and pro-representable 2-functors, that we develop elsewhere.
