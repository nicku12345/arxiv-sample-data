Using the Morita-type embedding, we show that any exact category with enough projectives has a realization as a (pre)resolving subcategory of a module category. When the exact category has enough injectives, the image of the embedding can be described in terms of Wakamatsu tilting (=semi-dualizing) subcategories. If moreover the exact category has higher kernels, then its image coincides with the category naturally associated with a cotilting subcategory up to summands. We apply these results to the representation theory of artin algebras. In particular, we show that the ideal quotient of a module category by a functorially finite subcategory closed under submodules is a torsionfree class of some module category.
