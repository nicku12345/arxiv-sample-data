For every functor \mathcal{F} : \mathcal{K} \to \mathbf{C}, where \mathcal{K} is a small category and \mathbf{C} is a model category which satisfies some mild hypotheses, we define a model category \mathbf{C}^m of \mathcal{K}-marked objects of \mathbf{C}. We consider an application of this construction to the category of simplicial sets with the Joyal model structure. Marked simplicial sets can be thought of as (\infty,1)-categories with some additional structure which depends on \mathcal{F}. In particular, we construct a model category of quasi-categories which have limits of all diagrams of any given shape.
