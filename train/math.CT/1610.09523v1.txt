For a commutative Noetherian ring R with finite Krull dimension, we study the nullity classes in D^c_{fg}(R), the full triangulated subcategory D^c_{fg}(R) of the derived category D(R) consisting of objects which can be represented by cofibrant objects with each degree finitely generated. In the light of perversity functions over the prime spectrum \mathrm{Spec} R, we prove that there is a complete invariant of nullity classes thus that of aisles (or equivalently, t-structures) in D^c_{fg}(R).
