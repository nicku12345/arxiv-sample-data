In this paper, we generalize Izumi's result on uniqueness of realization of finite C^*-tensor categories in the endomorphism category of the injective factor of type II_1 for finitely generated strongly amenable C^*-tensor categories by applying Popa's classification theorem of strongly amenable subfactors of type III_1.
