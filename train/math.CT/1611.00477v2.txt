In this paper, we introduce and study relative phantom morphisms in extriangulated categories defined by Nakaoka and Palu. Then using their properties, we show that if (\C,\E,\s) is an extriangulated category with enough injective objects and projective objects, then there exists a bijective correspondence between any two of the following classes: (1) special precovering ideals of \C; (2) special preenveloping ideals of \C; (3) additive subfunctors of \E having enough special injective morphisms; and (4) additive subfunctors of \E having enough special projective morphisms. Moreover, we show that if (\C,\E,\s) is an extriangulated category with enough injective objects and projective morphisms, then there exists a bijective correspondence between the following two classes: (1) all object-special precovering ideals of \C; (2) all additive subfunctors of \E having enough special injective objects.
