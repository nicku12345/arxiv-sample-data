Nearly three decades from his celebrated result, we study a modern refinement and strengthening of Kopperman's full metrisabilty of all topological spaces. Within this new theory of \emph{V-spaces}, developed by Flagg and Weiss, we investigate several topological notions and their metric counterpart. Among our main results is the reconstruction, in terms of V-spaces, of Kopperman's equivalence between symmetric value semigroups and completely regular topologies. We conclude our work by revisiting some classical topological results and their almost evident validity through this metric lens.
