We give a combinatorial model for the bounded derived category of graded modules over the dual numbers in terms of arcs on the integer line with a point at infinity. Using this model we describe the lattice of thick subcategories of the bounded derived category, and of the perfect complexes, in terms of non-crossing partitions. We also make some comments on the symmetries of these lattices, exceptional collections, and the analogous problem for the unbounded derived category.
