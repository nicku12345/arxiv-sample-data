We generalize the notion of coloring complex of a graph to linearized combinatorial Hopf monoids. These are a generalization of the notion of coloring complex of a graph. We determine when a combinatorial Hopf monoid has such a construction, and discover some inequalities that are satisfied by the quasisymmetric function invariants associated to the combinatorial Hopf monoid. We show that the collection of all such coloring complexes forms a combinatorial Hopf monoid, which is the terminal object in the category of combinatorial Hopf monoids with convex characters. We also study several examples of combinatorial Hopf monoids.
