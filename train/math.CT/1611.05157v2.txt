We associate, in a functorial way, a monoidal bicategory \mathsf{Span}| \mathcal V to any monoidal bicategory \mathcal V. Two examples of this construction are of particular interest: Hopf polyads (due to Brugui\`eres) can be seen as Hopf monads in \mathsf{Span}| \mathsf{Cat} while Hopf group monoids in a braided monoidal category V (in the spirit of Turaev and Zunino), and Hopf categories over V (by Batista, Caenepeel and Vercruysse) both turn out to be Hopf monads in \mathsf{Span}| V. Hopf group monoids and Hopf categories are Hopf monads on a distinguished type of monoidales fitting the framework studied recently by B\"ohm and Lack. These examples are related by a monoidal pseudofunctor V\to \mathsf{Cat}.
