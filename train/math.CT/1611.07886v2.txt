We discuss the notion of a span of cospans and define, for them, horizonal and vertical composition. These compositions satisfy the interchange law if working in a topos \mathbf{C} and if the span legs are monic. A bicategory is then constructed from \mathbf{C}-objects, \mathbf{C}-cospans, and doubly monic spans of \mathbf{C}-cospans. The primary motivation for this construction is an application to graph rewriting.
