In the setting of compactly generated triangulated categories, we show that the heart of a (co)silting t-structure is a Grothendieck category if and only if the (co)silting object satisfies a purity assumption. Moreover, in the cosilting case the previous conditions are related to the coaisle of the t-structure being a definable subcategory. If we further assume our triangulated category to be algebraic, it follows that the heart of any nondegenerate compactly generated t-structure is a Grothendieck category.
