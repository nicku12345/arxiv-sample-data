Let \mathcal{B} be a subcategory of a given category \mathcal{D}. Let \mathcal{B} has monoidal structure. In this article, we discuss when can one extend the monoidal structure of \mathcal{B} to \mathcal{D} such that \mathcal{B} becomes a sub monoidal category of monoidal category \mathcal{D}. Examples are discussed, and in particular, in an example of loop space, we elaborated all results discussed in this article.
