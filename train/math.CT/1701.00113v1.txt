We introduce a class of toposes called "absolutely locally compact" toposes and of "admissible" sheaf of rings over such toposes. To any such ringed topos (\mathcal{T},A) we attach an involutive convolution algebra \mathcal{C}_c(\mathcal{T},A) which is well defined up to Morita equivalence and characterized by the fact that the category of non-degenerate modules over \mathcal{C}_c(\mathcal{T},A) is equivalent to the category of sheaf of A-module over \mathcal{T}. In the case where A is the sheaf of real or complex Dedekind numbers, we construct several norms on this involutive algebra that allows to complete it in various Banach and C^*-algebras: L^1(\mathcal{T},A), C^*_{red}(\mathcal{T},A) and C^*_{max}(\mathcal{T},A). We also give some examples where this construction corresponds to well known constructions of involutive algebras, like groupoids convolution algebra and Leavitt path algebras.
