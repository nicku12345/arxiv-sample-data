We introduce the notion of a monoidal category enriched in a braided monoidal category \mathcal V. We set up the basic theory, and prove a classification result in terms of braided oplax monoidal functors to the Drinfeld center of some monoidal category \mathcal T.   Even the basic theory is interesting; it shares many characteristics with the theory of monoidal categories enriched in a symmetric monoidal category, but lacks some features. Of particular note, there is no cartesian product of braided-enriched categories, and the natural transformations do not form a 2-category, but rather satisfy a braided interchange relation.   Strikingly, our classification is slightly more general than what one might have anticipated in terms of strong monoidal functors \mathcal V \to Z(\mathcal T). We would like to understand this further; in a future paper we show that the functor is strong if and only if the enriched category is `complete' in a certain sense. Nevertheless it remains to understand what non-complete enriched categories may look like.   One should think of our construction as a generalization of de-equivariantization, which takes a strong monoidal functor \mathsf{Rep}(G) \to Z(\mathcal T) for some finite group G and a monoidal category \mathcal T, and produces a new monoidal category \mathcal T // G. In our setting, given any braided oplax monoidal functor \mathcal V \to Z(\mathcal T), for any braided \mathcal V, we produce \mathcal T // \mathcal V: this is not usually an `honest' monoidal category, but is instead \mathcal V-enriched. If \mathcal V has a braided lax monoidal functor to \mathsf{Vec}, we can use this to reduce the enrichment to \mathsf{Vec}, and this recovers de-equivariantization as a special case.
