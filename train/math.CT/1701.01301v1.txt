We present a unified categorical treatment of completeness theorems for several classical and intuitionistic infinitary logics with a proposed axiomatization. This provides new completeness theorems and subsumes previous ones by G\"odel, Kripke, Beth, Karp, Joyal, Makkai and Fourman/Grayson. As an application we prove, using large cardinals assumptions, the disjunction and existence properties for infinitary intuitionistic first-order logics.
