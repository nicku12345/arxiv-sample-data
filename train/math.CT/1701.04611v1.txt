Reasoning in the 2-category Con of contexts, certain sketches for arithmetic universes (i.e. list arithmetic pretoposes; AUs), is shown to give rise to base-independent results of Grothendieck toposes, provided the base elementary topos has a natural numbers object.   Categories of strict models of contexts T in AUs are acted on strictly on the left by non-strict AU-functors and strictly on the right by context maps, and the actions combine in a strict action of a Gray tensor product.   Any context extension T_0 \subset T_1 gives rise to a bundle. For each point of T_0 - a model M of T_0 in an elementary topos S with nno - its fibre is a generalized space, the classifying topos S[T_1/M] for the geometric theory T_1/M of T_1-models restricting to M. This construction is "geometric" in the sense that for any geometric morphism f: S' \to S, the classifier S'[T_1/f^\ast M] is got by pseudopullback of S[T_1/M] along f.   This is treated in a fibrational way by considering a 2-category GTop of Grothendieck toposes (bounded geometric morphisms) fibred (as bicategory) over a 2-category of elementary toposes with nno, geometric morphisms, and natural isomorphisms. The notion of classifying topos as representing object for a split fibration is then fibred over variable base using fibrations "locally representable" over a second fibration.
