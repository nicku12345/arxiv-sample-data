Let \mathbb{K} be an infinite field. We prove that if a variety of anti-commutative \mathbb{K}-algebras - not necessarily associative, where xx=0 is an identity - is locally algebraically cartesian closed, then it must be a variety of Lie algebras over \mathbb{K}. In particular, \mathsf{Lie}_{\mathbb{K}} is the largest such. Thus, for a given variety of anti-commutative \mathbb{K}-algebras, the Jacobi identity becomes equivalent to a categorical condition: it is an identity in~\mathcal{V} if and only if \mathcal{V} is a subvariety of a locally algebraically cartesian closed variety of anti-commutative \mathbb{K}-algebras. This is based on a result saying that an algebraically coherent variety of anti-commutative \mathbb{K}-algebras is either a variety of Lie algebras or a variety of anti-associative algebras over \mathbb{K}.
