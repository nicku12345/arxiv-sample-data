We show that, for a quantale V and a \mathsf{Set}-monad \mathbb{T} laxly extended to V-\mathsf{Rel}, the presheaf monad on the category of (\mathbb{T},V)-categories is simple, giving rise to a lax orthogonal factorisation system (lofs) whose corresponding weak factorisation system has embeddings as left part. In addition, we present presheaf submonads and study the LOFSs they define. This provides a method of constructing weak factorisation systems on some well-known examples of topological categories over \mathsf{Set}.
