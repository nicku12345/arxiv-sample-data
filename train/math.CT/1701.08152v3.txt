We give a general categorical construction that yields several monads of measures and distributions as special cases, alongside several monads of filters. The construction takes place within a categorical setting for generalized functional analysis, called a \textit{functional-analytic context}, formulated in terms of a given monad or algebraic theory \mathcal{T} enriched in a closed category \mathcal{V}. By employing the notion of \textit{commutant} for enriched algebraic theories and monads, we define the \textit{functional distribution monad} associated to a given functional-analytic context. We establish certain general classes of examples of functional-analytic contexts in cartesian closed categories \mathcal{V}, wherein \mathcal{T} is the theory of R-modules or R-affine spaces for a given ring or rig R in \mathcal{V}, or the theory of \textit{R-convex spaces} for a given preordered ring R in \mathcal{V}. We prove theorems characterizing the functional distribution monads in these contexts, and on this basis we establish several specific examples of functional distribution monads.
