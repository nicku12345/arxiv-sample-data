In this article, we study the heart of a cotorsion pairs on an exact category and a triangulated category in a unified meathod, by means of the notion of an extriangulated category. We prove that the heart is abelian, and construct a cohomological functor to the heart. If the extriangulated category has enough projectives, this functor gives an equivalence between the heart and the category of coherent functors over the coheart modulo projectives. We also show how an n-cluster tilting subcategory of an extriangulated category gives rise to a family of cotorsion pairs with equivalent hearts.
