Let \mathcal{C} be a finitely complete small category. In this paper, first we construct two weak (Lawvere-Tierney) topologies on the category of presheaves. One of them is established by means of a subfunctor of the Yoneda functor and the other one, is constructed by an admissible class on \mathcal{C} and the internal existential quantifier in the presheaf topos \widehat{\mathcal{C}}. Moreover, by using an admissible class on \mathcal{C}, we are able to define an action on the subobject classifier \Omega of \widehat{\mathcal{C}}. Then we find some necessary conditions for that the two weak topologies and also the double negation topology \neg\neg on \widehat{\mathcal{C}} to be action preserving maps. Finally, among other things, we constitute an action preserving weak topology on \widehat{\mathcal{C}}.
