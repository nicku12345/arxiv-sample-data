We construct a flagged \infty-category {\sf Corr} of \infty-categories and bimodules among them. We prove that {\sf Corr} classifies exponentiable fibrations. This representability of exponentiable fibrations extends that established by Lurie of both coCartesian fibrations and Cartesian fibrations, as they are classified by the \infty-category of \infty-categories and its opposite, respectively. We introduce the flagged \infty-subcategories {\sf LCorr} and {\sf RCorr} of {\sf Corr}, whose morphisms are those bimodules which are \emph{left final} and \emph{right initial}, respectively. We identify the notions of fibrations these flagged \infty-subcategories classify, and show that these \infty-categories carry universal left/right fibrations.
