We define a bar construction endofunctor on the category of commutative augmented monoids A of a symmetric monoidal category \mathcal{V} endowed with a left adjoint monoidal functor F:s\mathbf{Set}\to \mathcal{V}. To do this, we need to carefully examine the monoidal properties of the well-known (reduced) simplicial bar construction B_\bullet(1,A,1). We define a geometric realization |-| with respect to the image under F of the canonical cosimplicial simplicial set. This guarantees good monoidal properties of |-|: it is monoidal, and given a left adjoint monoidal functor G:\mathcal{V}\to \mathcal{W}, there is a monoidal transformation |G-|\Rightarrow G|-|. We can then consider BA=|B_\bullet A| and the iterations B^nA. We establish the existence of a graded multiplication on these objects, provided the category \mathcal{V} is cartesian and A is a ring object. The examples studied include simplicial sets and modules, topological spaces, chain complexes and spectra.
