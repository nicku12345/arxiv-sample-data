We give a definition of weak morphism of T-algebras, for a 2-monad T, with respect to an arbitrary family \Omega of 2-cells of the base 2-category. By considering particular choices of \Omega, we recover the concepts of lax, pseudo and strict morphisms of T-algebras. We give a general notion of weak limit, and define what it means for such a limit to be compatible with another family of 2-cells. These concepts allow us to prove a limit lifting theorem which unifies and generalizes three different previously known results of 2-dimensional monad theory. Explicitly, by considering the three choices of \Omega above our theorem has as corollaries the lifting of oplax (resp. \sigma, which generalizes lax and pseudo, resp. strict) limits to the 2-categories of lax (resp. pseudo, resp. strict) morphisms of T-algebras.
