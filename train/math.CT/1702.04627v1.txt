This article presents formalistic tool for description of structural and biochemical relations between cells in the course of development of the body of plants. This is flexible formalistic space, based on the Category theory and the Petri Net approach, which embeds and mutually supplements biological data from methodically different sources. Relation between functional and morphological ways of plant description was mathematically realized with help of the adjoint functors. It was shown that histology and proliferative activity of the formative tissues give a template for the gene interaction networks.
