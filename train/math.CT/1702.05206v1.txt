These notes follows the articles \cite{kamel, Cam, cam-cubique} which show how powerful can be the method of \textit{Stretchings} initiated with the \textit{Globular Geometry} by Jacques Penon in \cite{penon} , to weakened \textit{strict higher structures}. Here we adapt this method to weakened strict multiple \infty-categories, strict multiple (\infty,m)-categories, and in particular we obtain algebraic models of weak multiple \infty-groupoids.
