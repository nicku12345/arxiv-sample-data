In 1994, Long and Moody gave a construction on representations of braid groups which associates a representation of Bn with a representation of Bn+1. In this paper, we prove that this construction is functorial: it gives an endofunctor, called the Long-Moody functor, between the category of functors from the homogeneous category associated with the braid groupoid to a module category. Then we study the effect of the Long-Moody functor on strong polynomial functors: we prove that it increases by one the degree of strong polynomiality.
