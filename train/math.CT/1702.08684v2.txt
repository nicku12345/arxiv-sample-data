A. Avil\'es and C. Brech proved a intriguing result about the existence and uniqueness of certain injective Boolean algebras or Banach spaces. Their result refines the standard existence and uniqueness of saturated models. They express a wish to obtain a unified approach in the context of category theory. We provide this in the framework of weak factorization systems. Our basic tool is the fat small object argument.
