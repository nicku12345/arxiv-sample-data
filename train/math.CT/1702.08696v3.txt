In this note we show that a semisimplicial set with the weak Kan condition admits a simplicial structure, provided any object allows an idempotent self-equivalence. Moreover, any two choices of simplicial structures give rise to equivalent quasi-categories. The method is purely combinatorial and extends to semisimplicial objects in other categories; in particular to semi-simplicial spaces satisfying the Segal condition (semi-Segal spaces).
