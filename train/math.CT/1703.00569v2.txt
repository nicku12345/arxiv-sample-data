For a complete and cocomplete category \mathcal{C} with a well-behaved class of `projectives' \bar{\mathcal{P}}, we construct a model structure on the category s\mathcal{C} of simplicial objects in \mathcal{C} where the weak equivalences, fibrations and cofibrations are defined in terms of \bar{\mathcal{P}}. This holds in particular when \mathcal{C} is \mathcal{U}, the category of compactly generated, weakly Hausdorff spaces, and \bar{\mathcal{P}} is the class of compact Hausdorff spaces.   We also construct a new model structure on \mathcal{U} itself, where the cofibrant spaces are generalisations of CW-complexes allowing spaces, rather than sets, of n-cells to be attached. The singular simplicial complex and geometric realisation functors give a Quillen adjunction between these model structures.   For a space in \mathcal{U}, these structures allow the definition of homotopy group objects in the exact completion of \mathcal{U}, which are invariant under weak equivalence and have a lot of the nice properties usually expected of homotopy groups. There is a long exact sequence of homotopy group objects arising from a fibre sequence in \mathcal{U}.   Working along similar lines, we study homological algebra in categories of internal modules in \mathcal{U}, getting in particular a Lyndon--Hochschild--Serre spectral sequence for extensions of topological groups in \mathcal{U}.
