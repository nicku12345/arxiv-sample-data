In these notes we develop some basic theory of idempotents in monoidal categories. We introduce and study the notion of a pair of complementary idempotents in a triangulated monoidal category, as well as more general idempotent decompositions of identity. If \mathbf{E} is a categorical idempotent then \operatorname{End}(\mathbf{E}) is a graded commutative algebra. The same is true of \operatorname{Hom}(\mathbf{E},\mathbf{E}^c[1]) under certain circumstances, where \mathbf{E}^c is the complement. These generalize the notions of cohomology and Tate cohomology of a finite dimensional Hopf algebra, respectively.
