The aim of this paper is to prove a generalization of the famous Theorem A of Quillen for strict \infty-categories. This result is central to the homotopy theory of strict \infty-categories developed by the authors. The proof presented here is of a simplicial nature and uses Steiner's theory of augmented directed complexes. In a subsequent paper, we will prove the same result by purely \infty-categorical methods.
