In this article Hopf parametric adjunctions are defined and analysed within the context of the 2-adjunction of the type \mathbf{Adj}-\mathbf{Mnd}. In order to do so, the definition of adjoint objects in the 2-category of adjunctions and in the 2-category of monads for Cat are revised and characterized. This article finalises with the application of the obtained results on current categorical characterization of Hopf Monads.
