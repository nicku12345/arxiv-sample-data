Given the pair of a dualizing k-variety and its functorially finite subcategory, we show that there exists a recollement consisting of their functor categories of finitely presented objects. We provide several applications for Auslander's formulas: The first one realizes a module category as a Serre quotient of a suitable functor category. The second one shows a close connection between Auslander-Bridger sequences and recollements. The third one gives a new proof of the higher defect formula which includes the higher Auslander-Reiten duality as a special case.
