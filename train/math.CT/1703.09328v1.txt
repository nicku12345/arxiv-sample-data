A categorical point of view about minimization in subrecursive classes is presented by extending the concept of Symmetric Monoidal Comprehension to that of Distributive Minimization Comprehension. This is achieved by endowing the former with coproducts and a finality condition for coalgebras over the endofunctor sending X to {1}\oplus{X} to perform a safe minimization operator. By relying on the characterization given by Bellantoni, a tiered structure is presented from which one can obtain the levels of the Polytime Hierarchy as those classes of partial functions obtained after a certain number of minimizations.
