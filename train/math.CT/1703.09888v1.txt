Let \mathcal C be a category with finite colimits, and let (\mathcal E,\mathcal M) be a factorisation system on \mathcal C with \mathcal M stable under pushouts. Writing \mathcal C;\mathcal M^{\mathrm{op}} for the symmetric monoidal category with morphisms cospans of the form \stackrel{c}\to \stackrel{m}\leftarrow, where c \in \mathcal C and m \in \mathcal M, we give method for constructing a category from a symmetric lax monoidal functor F\colon (\mathcal C; \mathcal M^{\mathrm{op}},+) \to (\mathrm{Set},\times). A morphism in this category, termed a \emph{decorated corelation}, comprises (i) a cospan X \to N \leftarrow Y in \mathcal C such that the canonical copairing X+Y \to N lies in \mathcal E, together with (ii) an element of FN. Functors between decorated corelation categories can be constructed from natural transformations between the decorating functors F. This provides a general method for constructing hypergraph categories---symmetric monoidal categories in which each object is a special commutative Frobenius monoid in a coherent way---and their functors. Such categories are useful for modelling network languages, for example circuit diagrams, and such functors their semantics.
