The aim of this paper is to characterize the notion of internal category (groupoid) in the category of Leibniz algebras and investigate the properties of well-known notions such as covering groupoid and groupoid operations (actions) in this category. Further, for a fixed internal groupoid G, we prove that the category of covering groupoids of G and the category of internal groupoid actions of G on Leibniz algebras are equivalent. Finally we interpret the corresponding notion of covering groupoids in the category of crossed modules of Leibniz algebras.
