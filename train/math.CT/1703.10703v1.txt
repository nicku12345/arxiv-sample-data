In this paper, we introduce the notions of {\rm FP}_n-injective and {\rm FP}_n-flat complexes in terms of complexes of type {\rm FP}_n. We show that some characterizations analogous to that of injective, FP-injective and flat complexes exist for {\rm FP}_n-injective and {\rm FP}_n-flat complexes. We also introduce and study {\rm FP}_n-injective and {\rm FP}_n-flat dimensions of modules and complexes, and give a relation between them in terms of Pontrjagin duality. The existence of pre-envelopes and covers in this setting is discussed, and we prove that any complex has an {\rm FP}_n-flat cover and an {\rm FP}_n-flat pre-envelope, and in the case n \geq 2 that any complex has an {\rm FP}_n-injective cover and an {\rm FP}_n-injective pre-envelope. Finally, we construct model structures on the category of complexes from the classes of modules with bounded {\rm FP}_n-injective and {\rm FP}_n-flat dimensions, and analyze several conditions under which it is possible to connect these model structures via Quillen functors and Quillen equivalences.
