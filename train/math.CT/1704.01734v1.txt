We study the general properties of commutative differential graded algebras in the category of representations over a reductive algebraic group with an injective central cocharacter. Besides describing the derived category of differential graded modules over such an algebra, we also provide a criterion for the existence of a t-structure on the derived category together with a characterization of the coordinate ring of the Tannakian fundamental group of its heart.
