Abelian categories provide a self-dual axiomatic context for establishing homomorphism theorems (such as the isomorphism theorems and homological diagram lemmas) for abelian groups, and more generally, modules. In this paper we describe a self-dual context which allows one to establish the same theorems in the case of non-abelian group-like structures; the question of whether such a context can be found has been left open for seventy years. We also formulate and prove in our context a universal isomorphism theorem from which all other isomorphism theorems can be deduced.
