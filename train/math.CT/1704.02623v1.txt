We introduce two applications of polygraphs to categorification problems. We compute first, from a coherent presentation of an n-category, a coherent presentation of its Karoubi envelope. For this, we extend the construction of Karoubi envelope to n-polygraphs and linear (n,n-1)-polygraphs. The second problem treated in this paper is the construction of Grothendieck decategorifications for (n,n-1)-polygraphs. This construction yields a rewriting system presenting for example algebras categorified by a linear monoidal category. We finally link quasi-convergence of such rewriting systems to the uniqueness of direct sum decompositions for linear (n-1,n-1)-categories.
