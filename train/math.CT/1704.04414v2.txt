In this note, we deal with the fixed points of an endofunctor F: \mathcal{C} \longrightarrow \mathcal{C}. Three classes of fixed points are introduced, and the case when F is an endomorphism of a category with pretopology is investigated. We show existence of induced structures on the category of fixed points, and, when a pretopology is defined, give a characterization of fixed points in terms of sheaf cohomology on \mathcal{C}.
