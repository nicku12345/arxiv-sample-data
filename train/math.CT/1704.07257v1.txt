In this paper we define the notion of pullback lifting of a lifting crossed module over a crossed module morphism and interpret this notion in the category of group-groupoid actions as pullback action. Moreover, we give a criterion for the lifting of homotopic crossed module morphisms to be homotopic, which will be called homotopy lifting property for crossed module morphisms. Finally, we investigate some properties of derivations of lifting crossed modules according to base crossed module derivations.
