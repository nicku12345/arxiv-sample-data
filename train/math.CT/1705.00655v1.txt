In this paper we use the theory of formal moduli problems developed by Lurie in order to study the space of formal deformations of a k-linear \infty-category for a field k. Our main result states that if \mathcal{C} is a k-linear \infty-category which has a compact generator whose groups of self extensions vanish for sufficiently high positive degrees, then every formal deformation of \mathcal{C} has zero curvature and moreover admits a compact generator.
