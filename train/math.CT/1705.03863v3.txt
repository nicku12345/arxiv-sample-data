We develop a Gabriel-Morita theory for strong monads on pointed monoidal model categories. Assuming that the model category is excisive, i.e. the derived suspension functor is conservative, we show that if the monad T preserves cofibre sequences up to homotopy and has a weakly invertible strength, then the category of T-algebras is Quillen equivalent to the category of T(I)-modules where I is the monoidal unit. This recovers Schwede's theorem on connective stable homotopy over a pointed Lawvere theory as special case.
