We study the categories governing infinity (wheeled) properads. The graphical category, which was already known to be generalized Reedy, is in fact an Eilenberg-Zilber category. A minor alteration to the definition of the wheeled graphical category allows us to show that it is a generalized Reedy category. Finally, we present model structures for Segal properads and Segal wheeled properads.
