Generalising Nachbin's theory of "topology and order", in this paper we continue the study of quantale-enriched categories equipped with a compact Hausdorff topology. We compare these \mathcal{V}-categorical compact Hausdorff spaces with ultrafilter-quantale-enriched categories, and show that the presence of a compact Hausdorff topology guarantees Cauchy completeness and (suitably defined) codirected completeness of the underlying quantale enriched category.
