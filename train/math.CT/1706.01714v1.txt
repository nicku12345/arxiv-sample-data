After recalling basic definitions and constructions for a finite group G action on a k-linear category we give a concise proof of the following theorem of Elagin: if \mathcal{C} = \langle \mathcal{A}, \mathcal{B} \rangle is a semiorthogonal decomposition of a triangulated category which is preserved by the action of G, and \mathcal{C}^G is triangulated, then there is a semiorthogonal decomposition \mathcal{C}^G = \langle \mathcal{A}^G, \mathcal{B}^G \rangle. We also prove that any G-action on \mathcal{C} is weakly equivalent to a strict G-action which is the analog of the Coherence Theorem for monoidal categories.
