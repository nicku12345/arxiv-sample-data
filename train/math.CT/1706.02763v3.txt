This paper explores 1-dimensional topological quantum field theories. We separately deal with strict and strong 1-dimensional topological quantum field theories. The strict one is regarded as a symmetric monoidal functor between the category of 1-cobordisms and the category of matrices, and the strong one is a symmetric monoidal functor between the category of 1-cobordisms and the category of finite dimensional vector spaces. It has been proved that both strict and strong 1-dimensional topological quantum field theories are faithful.
