We prove a few results about the map Spc(F) induced on tensor-triangular spectra by a tensor-triangulated functor F. First, F is conservative if and only if Spc(F) is surjective on closed points. Second, if F detects tensor-nilpotence of morphisms then Spc(F) is surjective on the whole spectrum. In fact, surjectivity of Spc(F) is equivalent to F detecting the nilpotence of some class of morphisms, namely those morphisms which are nilpotent on their cone.
