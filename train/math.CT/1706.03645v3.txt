We establish a connection between two settings of representation stability for the symmetric groups S_n over \mathbb{C}. One is the symmetric monoidal category {\rm Rep}(S_{\infty}) of algebraic representations of the infinite symmetric group S_{\infty} = \bigcup_n S_n, related to the theory of {\bf FI}-modules. The other is the family of rigid symmetric monoidal Deligne categories \underline{{\rm Rep}}(S_t), t \in \mathbb{C}, together with their abelian versions \underline{{\rm Rep}}^{ab}(S_t), constructed by Comes and Ostrik.   We show that for any t \in \mathbb{C} the natural functor {\rm Rep}(S_{\infty}) \to \underline{{\rm Rep}}^{ab}(S_t) is an exact symmetric faithful monoidal functor, and compute its action on the simple representations of S_{\infty}. Considering the highest weight structure on \underline{{\rm Rep}}^{ab}(S_t), we show that the image of any object of {\rm Rep}(S_{\infty}) has a filtration with standard objects in \underline{{\rm Rep}}^{ab}(S_t).   As a by-product of the proof, we give answers to the questions posed by P. Deligne concerning the cohomology of some complexes in the Deligne category \underline{{\rm Rep}}(S_t), and their specializations at non-negative integers n.
