By a map p:Q\to X of involutive quantales is meant a homomorphism p^*:X\to Q. Calling a map p weakly open if p^* has a left adjoint p_! which satisfies the Frobenius reciprocity condition (i.e., p_! is a homomorphism of X-modules), we say that p is open if it is stably weakly open. We also study a two-sided version, FR2, of the Frobenius reciprocity condition, and show that the weakly open surjections that satisfy FR2 are open. Maps of the latter kind arise in the study of Fell bundles on groupoids.
