It is known since the late 1960's that the dual of the category of compact Hausdorff spaces and continuous maps is a variety -- not finitary, but bounded by \aleph_1. In this note we show that the dual of the category of partially ordered compact spaces and monotone continuous maps is a \aleph_1-ary quasivariety, and describe partially its algebraic theory. Based on this description, we extend these results to categories of Vietoris coalgebras and homomorphisms. We also characterise the \aleph_1-copresentable partially ordered compact spaces.
