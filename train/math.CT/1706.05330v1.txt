We study some natural generalizations of the spectral spaces in the contexts of commutative rings and distributive lattices. We obtain a topological characterization for the spectra of commutative (not necessarily unitary) rings and we find spectral versions for the up-spectral and down-spectral spaces. We show that the duality between distributive lattices and Balbes-Dwinger spaces is the co-equivalence associated to a pair of contravariant right adjoint functors between suitable categories.
