In this paper we detail a number of properties of the affine line of a derivator, including a number of morphisms between \mathbb{D} and \mathbb{A}^1_{\mathbb{D}}, a monoidal structure on \mathbb{A}^1_{\mathbb{D}} if \mathbb{D} is monoidal, and a universal property of \mathbb{A}^1_{\mathbb{D}} over \mathbb{D} akin to the universal property that R[t] has over R. These results also extend naturally to affine space \mathbb{A}^n over a derivator \mathbb{D}.
