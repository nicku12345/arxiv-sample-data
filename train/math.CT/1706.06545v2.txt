We study the projections of an arbitrary stably Gelfand quantale Q and show that each projection determines a pseudogroup S\subset Q (and a corresponding localic \'etale groupoid G) together with a map of involutive quantales p:Q\to\mathcal L^{\bigvee}(S)\ [=\mathcal O(G)]. As an application we obtain a simplified axiomatization of inverse quantal frames (= quantales of \'etale groupoids) whereby such a quantale is shown to be the same as a unital stably Gelfand quantal frame whose partial units cover Q.
