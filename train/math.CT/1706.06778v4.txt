We show that a subcategory of the m-cluster category of type \tilde{D_n} is isomorphic to a category consisting of arcs in an (n-2)m-gon with two central (m-1)-gons inside of it. We show that the mutation of colored quivers and m-cluster-tilting objects is compatible with the flip of an (m+2)-angulation. In the final part of this paper, we detail an example of a quiver of type \tilde{D_7}.
