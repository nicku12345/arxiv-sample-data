In this article, we study the geometric realizations of m-cluster categories of Dynkin types A, D, \tilde{A} and \tilde{D}. We show, in those four cases, that there is a bijection between (m+2)-angulations and isoclasses of basic m-cluster tilting objects. Under these bijections, flips of (m+2)-angulations correspond to mutations of m-cluster tilting objects. Our strategy consists in showing that certain Iyama-Yoshino reductions of the m-cluster categories under consideration can be described in terms of cutting along an arc the corresponding geometric realizations. This allows to infer results from small cases to the general ones.
