We relate the operad FMan controlling the algebraic structure on the tangent sheaf of an F-manifold (weak Frobenius manifold) defined by Hertling and Manin to the operad PreLie of pre-Lie algebras: for the filtration of PreLie by powers of the ideal generated by the Lie bracket, the associated graded object is FMan.
