This paper concerns the problem of lifting a KZ doctrine P to the 2-category of pseudo T-algebras for some pseudomonad T. Here we show that this problem is equivalent to giving a pseudo-distributive law (meaning that the lifted pseudomonad is automatically KZ), and that such distributive laws may be simply described algebraically and are essentially unique (as known to be the case in the (co)KZ over KZ setting).   Moreover, we give a simple description of these distributive laws using Bunge and Funk's notion of admissible morphisms for a KZ doctrine (the principal goal of this paper). We then go on to show that the 2-category of KZ doctrines on a 2-category is biequivalent to a poset.   We will also discuss here the case of lifting a locally fully faithful KZ doctrine, which we noted earlier enjoys most of the axioms of a Yoneda structure, and show that an oplax-lax bijection is exhibited on the lifted 'Yoneda structure' similar to Kelly's doctrinal adjunction. We also briefly discuss how this bijection may be viewed as a coherence result for oplax functors out of the bicategories of spans and polynomials, but leave the details for a future paper.
