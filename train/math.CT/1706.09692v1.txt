We show that the theory of derivators (or, more generally, of fibered multiderivators) on all small categories is equivalent to this theory on partially ordered sets, in the following sense: Every derivator (more generally, every fibered multiderivator) defined on partially ordered sets has an enlargement to all small categories that is unique up to equivalence of derivators. Furthermore, extending a theorem of Cisinski, we show that every bifibration of multi-model categories (basically a collection of model categories, and Quillen adjunctions in several variables between them) gives rise to a left and right fibered multiderivator on all small categories.
