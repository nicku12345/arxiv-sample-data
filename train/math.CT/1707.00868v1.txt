In order to deduce the internal version of the Brown exact sequence from the internal version of the Gabriel-Zisman exact sequence, we characterize fibrations and \ast-fibrations in the 2-category of internal groupoids in terms of the comparison functor from certain pullbacks to the corresponding strong homotopy pullbacks. A similar analysis in the category of arrows allows us to give a characterization of protomodular categories using strong homotopy kernels.
