For a topos \mathbf{T}, there is a bicategory \mathbf{MonicSp(Csp(T))} whose objects are those of \mathbf{T}, morphisms are cospans in \mathbf{T}, and 2-morphisms are isomorphism classes of monic spans of cospans in \mathbf{T}. Using a result of Shulman, we prove that \mathbf{MonicSp(Csp(T))} is symmetric monoidal, and moreover, that it is compact closed in the sense of Stay. We provide an application which illustrates how to encode double pushout rewrite rules as 2-morphisms inside a compact closed sub-bicategory of \mathbf{MonicSp(Csp(Graph))}.
