We give a characterization of finite pointed tensor categories obtained as de-equivariantizations of finite-dimensional pointed Hopf algebras over abelian groups only in terms of the (cohomology class of the) associator of the pointed part. As an application we prove that every coradically graded pointed finite braided tensor category is a de-equivariantization of a finite dimensional pointed Hopf algebras over an abelian group.
