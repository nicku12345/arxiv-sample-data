Consider a (possibly big) silting object U in a derived category over a (dg-)algebra A. Under some fairly general appropriate hypotheses, we show that it induces derived equivalences between the derived category over A and a localization of the derived category of dg-endomorphism algebra B of U. If, in addition, U is small then this localization is the whole derived category over B.
