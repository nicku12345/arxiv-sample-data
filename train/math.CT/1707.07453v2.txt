We prove that the 2-category Grt of Grothendieck abelian categories with colimit preserving functors and natural transformations is a bicategory of fractions in the sense of Pronk of the 2-category Site of linear sites with continuous morphisms of sites and natural transformations. This result can potentially be used to make the tensor product of Grothendieck categories from earlier work by Lowen, Shoikhet and the author into a bi-monoidal structure on Grt.
