We classify the ribbon structures of the Drinfeld center \mathcal{Z}(\mathcal{C}) of a finite tensor category \mathcal{C}. Our result generalizes Kauffman and Radford's classification result of the ribbon elements of the Drinfeld double of a finite-dimensional Hopf algebra. As a consequence, we see that \mathcal{Z}(\mathcal{C}) is a modular tensor category in the sense of Lyubashenko if \mathcal{C} is a spherical finite tensor category in the sense of Douglas, Schommer-Pries and Snyder.
