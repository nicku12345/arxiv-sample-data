We introduce categorical models of N_\infty spaces, which we call normed symmetric monoidal categories (NSMCs). These are ordinary symmetric monoidal categories equipped with compatible families of norm maps, and when specialized to a particular class of examples, they reveal a connection between the equivariant symmetric monoidal categories of Guillou-May-Merling-Osorno and those of Hill-Hopkins. We also give an operadic interpretation of the Mac Lane coherence theorem and generalize it to include NSMCs. Among other things, this theorem ensures that the classifying space of a NSMC is a N_\infty space. We conclude by extending our coherence theorem to include NSMCs with strict relations.
