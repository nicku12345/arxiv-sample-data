In the paper "Triangulations, orientals, and skew monoidal categories", the free monoidal category Fsk on a single generating object was described. We sharpen this by giving a completely explicit description of Fsk, and so of the free skew monoidal category on any category. As an application we describe adjunctions between the operad for skew monoidal categories and various simpler operads. For a particular such operad L, we identify skew monoidal categories with certain colax L-algebras.
