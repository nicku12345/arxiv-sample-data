The aim of this paper is to describe the classes of strongly flat and weakly cotorsion modules with respect to a multiplicative subset or a finite collection of multiplicative subsets in a commutative ring. The strongly flat modules are characterized by a set of conditions, while the weakly cotorsion modules are produced by a generation procedure. Passing to the collection of all countable multiplicative subsets, we define quite flat and almost cotorsion modules, and show that, over a Noetherian ring with countable spectrum, all flat modules are quite flat and all almost cotorsion modules are cotorsion.
