We introduce the notion of ST-pairs of triangulated subcategories, a prototypical example of which is the pair of the bound homotopy category and the bound derived category of a finite-dimensional algebra. For an ST-pair (\C,\D), we construct an order-preserving map from silting objects in \C to bounded t-structures on \D and show that the map is bijective if and only if \C is silting-discrete if and only if \D is t-discrete. Based on a work of Qiu and Woolf, the above result is applied to show that if \C is silting-discrete then the stability space of \D is contractible. This is used to obtain the contractibility of the stability spaces of some Calabi--Yau triangulated categories associated to Dynkin quivers.
