For a set of sorts S and an S-sorted signature \Sigma we prove that a profinite \Sigma-algebra, i.e., a projective limit of a projective system of finite \Sigma-algebras, is a retract of an ultraproduct of finite \Sigma-algebras if the family consisting of the finite \Sigma-algebras underlying the projective system is with constant support. In addition, we provide a categorial rendering of the above result. Specifically, after obtaining a category where the objects are the pairs formed by a nonempty upward directed preordered set and by an ultrafilter containing the filter of the final sections of it, we show that there exists a functor from the just mentioned category whose object mapping assigns to an object a natural transformation which is a retraction.
