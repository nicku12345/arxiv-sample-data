For a collection of subcategories satisfying a fixed set of conditions, for example thick subcategories of a triangulated category, we define a topological space called classifying space of subcategories. We show that this space classifies various prime subcategories in the sense that they bijectively correspond to the closed subsets of the classifying space. Many well-known results of subcategory classification fit into this framework. An example which cannot be classified by a topological space in the above sense is also given.
