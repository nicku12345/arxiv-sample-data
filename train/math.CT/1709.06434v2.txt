We show that a \mathbb{P}-object and simple configurations of \mathbb{P}-objects have a formal derived endomorphism algebra. Hence the triangulated category (classically) generated by such objects is independent of the ambient triangulated category. We also observe that the category generated by the structure sheaf of a smooth projective variety over the complex numbers only depends on its graded cohomology algebra.
