For each positive integer n we introduce the notion of n-exangulated categories as higher dimensional analogues of extriangulated categories defined by Nakaoka-Palu. We characterize which n-exangulated categories are n-exact in the sense of Jasso and which are (n+2)-angulated in the sense of Geiss-Keller-Oppermann. For extriangulated categories with enough projectives and injectives we introduce the notion of n-cluster tilting subcategories and show that under certain conditions such n-cluster tilting subcategories are n-exangulated.
