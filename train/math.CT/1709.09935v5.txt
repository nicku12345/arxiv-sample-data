We exhibit the simplex category \Delta and Segal's category \Gamma as \infty-categorical localizations of the dendroidal categories \Omega_\pi and \Omega introduced by Moerdijk and Weiss. As an application we obtain an equivalence of \infty-categories between invertible \infty-operads and the 2-Segal spaces of Dyckerhoff and Kapranov. Finally, we describe a cyclic version of the dendroidal category and explain how it \infty-localizes to Connes's cyclic category \Lambda.
