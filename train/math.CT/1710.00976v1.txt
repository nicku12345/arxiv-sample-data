Let \mathbb{K} be an algebraically closed field of characteristic 0. We study a monoidal category \mathbb{T}_\alpha which is universal among all symmetric \mathbb{K}-linear monoidal categories generated by two objects A and B such that A has a, possibly transfinite, filtration. We construct \mathbb{T}_\alpha as a category of representations of the Lie algebra \mathfrak{gl}^M(V_*,V) consisting of endomorphisms of a fixed diagonalizable pairing V_*\otimes V\to \mathbb{K} of vector spaces V_* and V of dimension \alpha. Here \alpha is an arbitrary cardinal number. We describe explicitly the simple and the injective objects of \mathbb{T}_\alpha and prove that the category \mathbb{T}_\alpha is Koszul. We pay special attention to the case where the filtration on A is finite. In this case \alpha=\aleph_t for t\in\mathbb{Z}_{\geq 0}.
