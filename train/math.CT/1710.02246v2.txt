We prove a strong conceptual completeness theorem (in the sense of Makkai) for the infinitary logic \mathcal L_{\omega_1\omega}: every countable \mathcal L_{\omega_1\omega}-theory can be canonically recovered from its standard Borel groupoid of countable models, up to a suitable syntactical notion of equivalence. This implies that given two theories (\mathcal L, \mathcal T) and (\mathcal L', \mathcal T') (in possibly different languages \mathcal L, \mathcal L'), every Borel functor \mathsf{Mod}(\mathcal L', \mathcal T') \to \mathsf{Mod}(\mathcal L, \mathcal T) between the respective groupoids of countable models is Borel naturally isomorphic to the functor induced by some \mathcal L'_{\omega_1\omega}-interpretation of \mathcal T in \mathcal T'. This generalizes a recent result of Harrison-Trainor, Miller, and Montalb\'an in the case where \mathcal T, \mathcal T' each have a single countable model up to isomorphism.
