Dyckerhoff--Kapranov and G\'alvez-Carrillo--Kock--Tonks independently introduced the notion of a 2-Segal space, that is, a simplicial space satisfying 2-dimensional analogues of the Segal conditions, as a unifying framework for understanding the numerous Hall algebra-like constructions appearing in algebraic geometry, representation theory and combinatorics. In particular, they showed that every 2-Segal object defines an algebra object in the \infty-category of spans.   In this paper we show that this algebra structure is inherited from the initial simplicial object \Delta[\bullet]. Namely, we show that the standard 1-simplex \Delta[1] carries a lax algebra structure. As a formal consequence the space of 1-simplices of a simplicial space is also a lax algebra. We further show that the 2-Segal conditions are equivalent to the associativity of this lax algebra.
