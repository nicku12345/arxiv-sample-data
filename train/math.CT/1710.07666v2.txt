Let (\mathcal C,\otimes,\mathbb 1) be an abelian symmetric monoidal category satisfying certain exactness conditions. In this paper we define a presheaf \mathbb P^{n}_{\mathcal C} on the category of commutative algebras in \mathcal C and we prove that this functor is a \mathcal C-scheme in the sense of Toen and Vaqui\'e. This construction gives us a context of non-associative relative algebraic geometry. The most important example of the construction is the octonionic projective space.
