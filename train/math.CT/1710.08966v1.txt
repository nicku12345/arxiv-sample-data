We study the existence and uniqueness of minimal right determiners in various categories. Particularly in a Hom-finite hereditary abelian category with enough projectives, we prove that the Auslander-Reiten-Smal{\o}-Ringel formula of the minimal right determiner still holds. As an application, we give a formula of minimal right determiners in the category of finitely presented representations of strongly locally finite quivers.
