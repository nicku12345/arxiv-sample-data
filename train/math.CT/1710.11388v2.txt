In the enriched setting, the notions of injective and projective model structures on a category of enriched diagrams also make sense. In this paper, we prove the existence of these model structures on enriched diagram categories under local presentability, accessibility, and "acyclicity" conditions, using the methods of lifting model structures from an adjunction introduced by Garner, Hess, Kedziorek, Riehl, and Shipley.
