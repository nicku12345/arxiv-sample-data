Given a complete hereditary cotorsion pair (\mathcal{A}, \mathcal{B}) in an abelian category \mathcal{C} satisfying certain conditions, we study the completeness of the induced cotorsion pairs (\Phi(\mathcal{A}), \Phi(\mathcal{A})^{\perp}) and (^{\perp}\Psi(\mathcal{B}), \Psi(\mathcal{B}) ) in the category \mbox{Rep}(Q, \mathcal{C}) of \mathcal{C}-valued representations of a given quiver Q. We show that if Q is left rooted, then the cotorsion pair (\Phi(\mathcal{A}), \Phi(\mathcal{A})^{\perp}) is complete, and if Q is right rooted, then the cotorsion pair (^{\perp}\Psi(\mathcal{B}), \Psi(\mathcal{B}) ) is complete. Besides, we work on the infinite line quiver A_{\infty}^{\infty}, which is neither left rooted nor right rooted. We prove that these cotorsion pairs in \mbox{Rep}(A_{\infty}^{\infty}, R) are complete, as well.
