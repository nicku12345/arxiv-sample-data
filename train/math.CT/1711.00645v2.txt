We further the techniques developed by Etingof, Nikshych, and Ostrik in order to classify the \mathcal{C}-based equivalences between two G-graded extensions of \mathcal{C}. The main result of this paper (which follows from this classification) shows that there is an action of the group \operatorname{Aut}(G)\times \operatorname{Aut}_\otimes(\mathcal{C}) on the set of all G-graded extensions of \mathcal{C}, and further, any two extensions in the same orbit of this action are monoidally equivalent. As a warm up for the proof of our classification result we reprove the classification of graded extensions of a fusion category, making extensive use of graphical calculus. Aside from our main result, we provide several other practical applications of our classification of \mathcal{C}-based equivalences.
