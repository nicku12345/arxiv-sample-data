In this article we describe varieties of Lie algebras via algebraic exponentiation, a concept introduced by Gray in his Ph.D. thesis. For \mathbb{K} an infinite field of characteristic different from 2, we prove that the variety of Lie algebras over \mathbb{K} is the only variety of non-associative \mathbb{K}-algebras which is a non-abelian locally algebraically cartesian closed (LACC) category. More generally, a variety of n-algebras \mathcal{V} is a non-abelian (LACC) category if and only if n=2 and \mathcal{V}=\mathsf{Lie}_\mathbb{K}. In characteristic 2 the situation is similar, but here we have to treat the identities xx=0 and xy=-yx separately, since each of them gives rise to a variety of non-associative \mathbb{K}-algebras which is a non-abelian (LACC) category.
