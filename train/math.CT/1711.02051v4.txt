Given a pseudomonad \mathcal{T} , we prove that a lax \mathcal{T} -morphism between pseudoalgebras is a \mathcal{T} -pseudomorphism if and only if there is a suitable (possibly non-canonical) invertible \mathcal{T} -transformation. This result encompasses several results on \textit{non-canonical isomorphisms}, including Lack's result on normal monoidal functors between braided monoidal categories, since it is applicable in any 2-category of pseudoalgebras, such as the 2-categories of monoidal categories, cocomplete categories, pseudofunctors and so on.
