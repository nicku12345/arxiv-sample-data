We study the Yoneda lemma for arbitrary simplicial spaces. We do that by introducing left fibrations of simplicial spaces and and studying its associated model structure, the covariant model structure. In particular, we prove a recognition principle for covariant equivalences over an arbitrary simplicial space and invariance of the covariant model structure with respect to complete Segal space equivalences.
