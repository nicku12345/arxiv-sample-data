We consider the d\'ecalage construction \operatorname{Dec} and its right adjoint T. These functors are induced on the category of simplicial objects valued in any bicomplete category \mathcal{C} by the ordinal sum. We identify T \operatorname{Dec}X with the path object X^{\Delta[1]} for any simplicial object X. We then use this formula to produce an explicit retracting homotopy for the unit X\to T\operatorname{Dec}X of the adjunction (\operatorname{Dec},T). When \mathcal{C} is a category of objects of an algebraic nature, we then show that the unit is a weak equivalence of simplicial objects in \mathcal{C}.
