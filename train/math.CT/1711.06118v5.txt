We describe equivalence classes of exact indecomposable module categories over a finite graded tensor category. When applied to a pointed fusion category, our results coincide with the ones obtained in [S. Natale, On the equivalence of module categories over a group-theoretical fusion category, SIGMA, Symmetry Integrability Geom. Methods Appl. 13 Paper 042, 9 p. (2017)].
