We define the notion of an infinitely generated tilting object of infinite homological dimension in an abelian category. A one-to-one correspondence between \infty-tilting objects in complete, cocomplete abelian categories with an injective cogenerator and \infty-cotilting objects in complete, cocomplete abelian categories with a projective generator is constructed. We also introduce \infty-tilting pairs, consisting of an \infty-tilting object and its \infty-tilting class, and obtain a bijective correspondence between \infty-tilting and \infty-cotilting pairs. Finally, we discuss the related derived equivalences and t-structures.
