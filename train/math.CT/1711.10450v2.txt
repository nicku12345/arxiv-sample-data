Given an exact category \mathcal{C}, it is well known that the connected component reflector \pi_0\colon\mathsf{Gpd}(\mathcal{C})\to\mathcal{C} from the category \mathsf{Gpd}(\mathcal{C}) of internal groupoids in \mathcal{C} to the base category \mathcal{C} is semi-left-exact. In this article we investigate the existence of a monotone-light factorisation system associated with this reflector. We show that, in general, there is no monotone-light factorisation system (\mathcal{E}',\mathcal{M}^*) in \mathsf{Gpd}(\mathcal{C}), where \mathcal{M}^* is the class of coverings in the sense of the corresponding Galois theory. However, when restricting to the case where \mathcal{C} is an exact Mal'tsev category, we show that the so-called comprehensive factorization of regular epimorphisms in \mathsf{Gpd}(\mathcal{C}) is the relative monotone-light factorisation system (in the sense of Chikhladze) in the category \mathsf{Gpd}(\mathcal{C}) corresponding to the connected component reflector, where \mathcal{E}' is the class of final functors and \mathcal{M}^* the class of regular epimorphic discrete fibrations.
