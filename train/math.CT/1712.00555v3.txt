Given a \infty-category X we exhibit the \infty-category of right adjoint functors with target X as a localization of the opposite of the \infty-category of monads on X. This localization restricts to an equivalence between the \infty-category of monadic functors with target X and the opposite of the \infty-category of monads on X.   We refine this result in the case that the monads carry "algebraic" structure, e.g. are monads on a (symmetric) monoidal \infty-category compatible with the (symmetric) monoidal structure, monads on a \infty-operad compatible with the \infty-operad structure or monads on a double \infty-category compatible with this structure.   This says that structure on a monad corresponds to structure on its \infty-category of algebras.   Moreover we prove dual results about left adjoint functors, comonads and comonadic functors.
