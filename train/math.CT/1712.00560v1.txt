Following Lawvere's description of metric spaces using enriched category theory, we introduce a change in the base of enrichment that allows description of some aspects of (relativistic) causal spaces. All such spaces are Cauchy complete, in the sense of enriched category theory. Furthermore, we give sufficient conditions on a base monoidal category for which enriched categories are Cauchy complete if and only if their underlying categories are (their idempotent arrows split).
