We develop the theory of weak Fraisse categories, where the crucial concept is the weak amalgamation property, discovered relatively recently in model theory. We show that, in a suitable framework, every weak Fraisse category has its unique limit, a special object in a bigger category, characterized by certain variant of injectivity. This significantly extends the known theory of Fraisse limits.
