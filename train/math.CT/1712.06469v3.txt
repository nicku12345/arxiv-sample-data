We develop an \infty-categorical version of the classical theory of polynomial and analytic functors, initial algebras, and free monads. Using this machinery, we provide a new model for \infty-operads, namely \infty-operads as analytic monads. We justify this definition by proving that the \infty-category of analytic monads is equivalent to that of dendroidal Segal spaces, known to be equivalent to the other existing models for \infty-operads.
