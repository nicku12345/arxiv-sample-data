Suppose that F: \mathcal{N} \to \mathcal{M} is a functor whose target is a Quillen model category. We give a succinct sufficient condition for the existence of the right-induced model category structure on \mathcal{N} in the case when F admits both adjoints. We give several examples, including change-of-rings, operad-like structures, and anti-involutive structures on infinity categories. For the last of these, we explore anti-involutive structures for several different models of (\infty, 1)-categories, and show that known Quillen equivalences between base model categories lift to equivalences.
