We introduce the notion of an enriched fibration, i.e. a fibration whose total category and base category are enriched in those of a monoidal fibration in an appropriate way. Furthermore, we provide a way to obtain such a structure, starting from actions of monoidal categories with parameterized adjoints. The motivating goal is to capture certain example cases, like the fibration of modules over algebras enriched in the opfibration of comodules over coalgebras.
