Let (\mbox{mod} \Lambda',\mbox{mod} \Lambda,\mbox{mod} \Lambda'') be a recollement of abelian categories for artin algebras \Lambda', \Lambda and \Lambda''. Under certain conditions, we present an explicit construction of gluing of (support) \tau-tilting modules in \mbox{mod} \Lambda with respect to (support) \tau-tilting modules in \mbox{mod} \Lambda' and \mbox{mod} \Lambda'' respectively; conversely, we study the construction of (support) \tau-tilting modules in \mbox{mod} \Lambda' and \mbox{mod} \Lambda'' obtained from (support) \tau-tilting modules in \mbox{mod} \Lambda.
