Let \mathcal{C} be a finite tensor category, and let \mathcal{M} be an exact left \mathcal{C}-module category. The action of \mathcal{C} on \mathcal{M} induces a functor \rho: \mathcal{C} \to \mathrm{Rex}(\mathcal{M}), where \mathrm{Rex}(\mathcal{M}) is the category of k-linear right exact endofunctors on \mathcal{M}. Our key observation is that \rho has a right adjoint \rho^{\mathrm{ra}} given by the end \rho^{\mathrm{ra}}(F) = \int_{M \in \mathcal{M}} \underline{\mathrm{Hom}}(M, M). As an application, we establish the following results: (1) We give a description of the composition of the induction functor \mathcal{C}_{\mathcal{M}}^* \to \mathcal{Z}(\mathcal{C}_{\mathcal{M}}^*) and Schauenburg's equivalence \mathcal{Z}(\mathcal{C}_{\mathcal{M}}^*) \approx \mathcal{Z}(\mathcal{C}). (2) We introduce the space \mathrm{CF}(\mathcal{M}) of `class functions' of \mathcal{M} and initiate the character theory for pivotal module categories. (3) We introduce a filtration for \mathrm{CF}(\mathcal{M}) and discuss its relation with some ring-theoretic notions, such as the Reynolds ideal and its generalizations. (4) We show that \mathrm{Ext}_{\mathcal{C}}^{\bullet}(1, \rho^{\mathrm{ra}}(\mathrm{id}_{\mathcal{M}})) is isomorphic to the Hochschild cohomology of \mathcal{M}. As an application, we show that the modular group acts projectively on the Hochschild cohomology of a modular tensor category.
