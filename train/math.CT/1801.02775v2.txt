We give an account of Bousfield localisation and colocalisation for one-dimensional model categories---ones enriched over the model category of 0-types. A distinguishing feature of our treatment is that it builds localisations and colocalisations using only the constructions of projective and injective transfer of model structures along right and left adjoint functors, and without any reference to Smith's theorem.
