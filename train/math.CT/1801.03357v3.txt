The aim of this paper is to construct singular equivalences between functor categories. As a special case, we show that there exists a singular equivalence arising from a cotilting module T, namely, the singularity category of (^\perp T)/[T] and that of (\mod A)/[T] are triangle equivalent. In particular, the canonical module \omega over a commutative Noetherian ring induces a singular equivalence between (\mathsf{CM}R)/[\omega] and (\mod R)/[\omega], which generalizes Matsui-Takahashi's theorem. Our result is based on a sufficient condition for an additive category \mathcal{A} and its subcategory \mathcal{X} so that the canonical inclusion \mathcal{X}\hookrightarrow\mathcal{A} induces a singular equivalence \mathsf{D_{sg}}(\mathcal{A})\simeq \mathsf{D_{sg}}(\mathcal{X}), which is a functor category version of Xiao-Wu Chen's theorem.
