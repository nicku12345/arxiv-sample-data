We show how to define biproducts up to isomorphism in an arbitrary category without assuming any enrichment. The resulting notion coincides with the usual definitions whenever all binary biproducts exist or the category is suitably enriched, resulting in a modest yet strict generalization otherwise. We also characterize when a category has all binary biproducts in terms of an ambidextrous adjunction. Finally, we give some new examples of biproducts that our definition recognizes.
