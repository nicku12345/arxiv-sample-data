We introduce \emph{flagged (\infty,n)-categories} and prove that they are equivalent to Segal sheaves on Joyal's category {\mathbf\Theta}_n. As such, flagged (\infty,n)-categories provide a model-independent formulation of Segal sheaves. This result generalizes the statement that n-groupoid objects in spaces are effective, as we explain and contextualize. Along the way, we establish a useful expression for the univalent-completion of such a Segal sheaf. Finally, we conjecture a characterization of flagged (\infty,n)-categories as stacks on (\infty,n)-categories that satisfy descent with respect to colimit diagrams that do not generate invertible i-morphisms for any i.
