Forking is a central notion of model theory, generalizing linear independence in vector spaces and algebraic independence in fields. We develop the theory of forking in abstract, category-theoretic terms, for reasons both practical (we require a characterization suitable for work in \mu-abstract elementary classes, i.e. accessible categories with all morphisms monomorphisms) and expository (we hope, with this account, to make forking accessible - and useful - to a broader mathematical audience). In particular, we present an axiomatic definition of what we call a stable independence notion on a category and show that this is in fact a purely category-theoretic axiomatization of the properties of model-theoretic forking in a stable first-order theory.
