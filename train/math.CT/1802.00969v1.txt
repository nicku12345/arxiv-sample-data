In this paper, we study tensor (or monoidal) categories of finite rank over an algebraically closed field \mathbb F. Given a tensor category \mathcal{C}, we have two structure invariants of \mathcal{C}: the Green ring (or the representation ring) r(\mathcal{C}) and the Auslander algebra A(\mathcal{C}) of \mathcal{C}. We show that a Krull-Schmit abelian tensor category \mathcal{C} of finite rank is uniquely determined (up to tensor equivalences) by its two structure invariants and the associated associator system of \mathcal{C}. In fact, we can reconstruct the tensor category \mathcal{C} from its two invarinats and the associator system. More general, given a quadruple (R, A, \phi, a) satisfying certain conditions, where R is a \mathbb{Z}_+-ring of rank n, A is a finite dimensional \mathbb F-algebra with a complete set of n primitive orthogonal idempotents, \phi is an algebra map from A\otimes_{\mathbb F}A to an algebra M(R, A, n) constructed from A and R, and a=\{a_{i,j,l}|1< i,j,l<n\} is a family of "invertible" matrices over A, we can construct a Krull-Schmidt and abelian tensor category \mathcal C over \mathbb{F} such that R is the Green ring of \mathcal C and A is the Auslander algebra of \mathcal C. In this case, \mathcal C has finitely many indecomposable objects (up to isomorphisms) and finite dimensional Hom-spaces. Moreover, we will give a necessary and sufficient condition for such two tensor categories to be tensor equivalent.
