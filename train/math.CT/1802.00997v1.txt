We assemble polynomials in a locally cartesian closed category into a tricategory, allowing us to define the notion of a polynomial pseudomonad and polynomial pseudoalgebra. Working in the context of natural models of type theory, we prove that dependent type theories admitting a unit type and dependent sum types give rise to polynomial pseudomonads, and that those admitting dependent product types give rise to polynomial pseudoalgebras.
