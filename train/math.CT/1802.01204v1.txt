In this work we study the notion of Whitehead sequence in the category of crossed modules and actions of crossed modules. As expected, Whitehead sequences in that context are the same as crossed squares. We investigate under which conditions a Whitehead sequence of crossed modules gives rise to an internal groupoid in the category of crossed modules. In other words, we explicitly investigate the so called "Smith is Huq" condition in the category of crossed modules.
