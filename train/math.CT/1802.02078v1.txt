The main result of this paper establishes a bijection between the set of equivalence classes of simple transitive 2-representations with a fixed apex \mathcal{J} of a fiat 2-category \cC and the set of equivalence classes of faithful simple transitive 2-representations of the fiat 2-subquotient of \cC associated with a diagonal \mathcal{H}-cell in \mathcal{J}. As an application, we classify simple transitive 2-representations of various categories of Soergel bimodules, in particular, completing the classification in types B_3 and B_4.
