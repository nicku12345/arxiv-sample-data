Although the notion of crossed groups was originally introduced only in the simplicial case, the definition makes sense in the other categories. For instance, Batanin and Markl studied crossed interval groups to investigate symmetries on the Hochschild cohomology in view of operads. The aim of this paper is to make a comprehensive understanding of crossed groups for arbitrary base categories. In particular, we focus on the local presentability of the category of crossed groups, monadicity, and the basechange theorem along certain sorts of functors. The paper also contains the classification of crossed interval groups, which Batanin and Markl concerned about.
