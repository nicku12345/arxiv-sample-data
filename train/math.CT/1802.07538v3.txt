The subject of this paper is the higher structure of the strictification adjunction, which relates the two fundamental bases of three-dimensional category theory: the \mathbf{Gray}-category of 2-categories and the tricategory of bicategories. We show that -- far from requiring the full weakness provided by the definitions of tricategory theory -- this adjunction can be \textit{strictly} enriched over the symmetric closed multicategory of bicategories defined by Verity. Moreover, we show that this adjunction underlies an adjunction of bicategory-enriched symmetric multicategories. An appendix introduces the symmetric closed multicategory of pseudo double categories, into which Verity's symmetric multicategory of bicategories embeds fully.
