We observe that the category of topological space, uniform spaces, and simplicial sets are all, in a natural way, full subcategories of the same larger category, namely the simplicial category of filters; this is, moreover, implicit in the definitions of a topological and uniform space.   We use these embeddings to rewrite the notions of completeness, precompactness, compactness, Cauchy sequence, and equicontinuity in the language of category theory, which we hope might be of use in formalisation of mathematics and tame topology. We formulate some arising open questions.
