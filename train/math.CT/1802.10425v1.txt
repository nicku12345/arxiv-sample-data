We characterise the class of exponentiable \infty-toposes: \mathcal X is exponentiable if and only if \mathcal S\mathrm{h}(\mathcal X) is a continuous \infty-category. The heart of the proof is the description of the \infty-category of \mathcal C-valued sheaves on \mathcal X as an \infty-category of functors that satisfy finite limits conditions as well as filtered colimits conditions (instead of limits conditions purely); we call such functors \omega-continuous sheaves.   As an application, we show that when \mathcal X is exponentiable, its \infty-category of stable sheaves \mathcal S\mathrm{h}(\mathcal X, \mathrm{Sp}) is a dualisable object in the \infty-category of presentable stable \infty-categories.
