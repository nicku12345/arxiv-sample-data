For a locally finitely presented Grothendieck category \mathcal{A}, we consider a certain subcategory of the homotopy category of FP-injective objects in \mathcal{A} which we show is compactly generated. In the case where \mathcal{A} is locally coherent, we identify this subcategory with the derived category of FP-injective objects in \mathcal{A}. Our results are, in a sense, dual to the ones obtained by Neeman on the homotopy category of flat modules. Our proof is based on extending a characterization of the pure acyclic complexes which is due to Emmanouil.
