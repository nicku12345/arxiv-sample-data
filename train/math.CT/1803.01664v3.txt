Adjoint functor theorems give necessary and sufficient conditions for a functor to admit an adjoint. In this paper we prove general adjoint functor theorems for functors between \infty-categories. One of our main results is an \infty-categorical generalization of Freyd's classical General Adjoint Functor Theorem. As an application of this result, we recover Lurie's adjoint functor theorems for presentable \infty-categories. We also discuss the comparison between adjunctions of \infty-categories and homotopy adjunctions, and give a treatment of Brown representability for \infty-categories based on Heller's purely categorical formulation of the classical Brown representability theorem.
