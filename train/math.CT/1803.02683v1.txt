We show how the theory of (dual) strongly relative Rickart objects may be employed in order to study strongly relative regular objects and (dual) strongly relative Baer objects in abelian categories. For each of them, we prove general properties, we analyze the behaviour with respect to (co)products, and we study the transfer via functors. We also give applications to Grothendieck categories, (graded) module categories and comodule categories.
