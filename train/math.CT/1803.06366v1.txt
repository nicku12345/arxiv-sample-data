Let \beta be the functor from Set to CHaus which maps each discrete set X to its Stone-Cech compactification, the set \beta X of ultrafilters on X. Every graph G with vertex set V naturally gives rise to a graph \beta G on the set \beta V of ultrafilters on V . In what follows, we interrelate the properties of G and \beta G. Perhaps the most striking result is that G can be finitely coloured iff \beta G has no loops.
