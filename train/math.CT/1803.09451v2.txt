The derived category D[C,V] of the Grothendieck category of enriched functors [C,V], where V is a closed symmetric monoidal Grothendieck category and C is a small V-category, is studied. We prove that if the derived category D(V) of V is a compactly generated triangulated category with certain reasonable assumptions on compact generators or K-injective resolutions, then the derived category D[C,V] is also compactly generated triangulated. Moreover, an explicit description of these generators is given.
