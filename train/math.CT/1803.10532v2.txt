We prove that the forgetful functor from the category of Boolean inverse semigroups to inverse semigroups with zero has a left adjoint. This left adjoint is what we term the `Booleanization'. We establish the exact connection between the Booleanization of an inverse semigroup and Paterson's universal groupoid of the inverse semigroup and we explicitly compute the Booleanization of the polycyclic inverse monoid P_{n} and demonstrate its affiliation with the Cuntz-Toeplitz algebra.
