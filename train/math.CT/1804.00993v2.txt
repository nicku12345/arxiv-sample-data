In this paper we study the descent problem of cohesive modules on compact complex manifolds. For a complex manifold X we could consider the Dolbeault dg-algebra \mathcal{A}(X) on it and Block in 2006 introduced a dg-category \mathcal{P}_{\mathcal{A}(X)}, called cohesive modules, associated with \mathcal{A}(X). The same construction works for any open subset U\subset X and we obtain a dg-presheaf on X given by U\mapsto \mathcal{P}_{\mathcal{A}(U)}. In this paper we prove that this dg-presheaf satisfies descent for any locally finite open cover of a compact manifold X. This generalizes a result by Ben-Bassat and Block in 2012, which studied the case that X is covered by two open subsets.
