In The factorization of the Giry monad (arXiv:1707.00488v2) the author asserts that the category of convex spaces is equivalent to the category of Eilenberg-Moore algebras over the Giry monad. Some of the statements employed in the proof of this claim have been refuted in our earlier paper (arXiv:1803.07956). Building on the results of that paper we prove that no such equivalence exists and a parallel statement is proved for the category of super convex spaces.
