For the category \mathscr V of complex algebraic varieties, the Grothendieck group of the commutative monoid of the isomorphism classes of correspondences X \xleftarrow f M \xrightarrow g Y with proper morphism f and smooth morphism g (such a correspondence is called \emph{a proper-smooth correspondence}) gives rise to an enriched category \mathscr Corr(\mathscr V)^+_{pro-sm} of proper-smooth correspondences. In this paper we extend the well-known theories of characteristic classes of singular varieties such as Baum-Fulton-MacPherson's Riemann-Roch (abbr. BFM-RR) and MacPherson's Chern class transformation and so on to this enriched category \mathscr Corr(\mathscr V)^+_{pro-sm}. In order to deal with local complete intersection (abbr. \ell.c.i.) morphism instead of smooth morphism, in a similar manner we consider an enriched category \mathscr Zigzag(\mathscr V)^+_{pro-\ell.c.i.} of \emph{proper-\ell.c.i.} zigzags and extend BFM-RR to this enriched category \mathscr Zigzag(\mathscr V)^+_{pro-\ell.c.i.}. We also consider an enriched category \mathscr M_{*,*}(\mathscr V)^+_{\otimes} of proper-smooth correspondences (X \xleftarrow f M \xrightarrow g Y; E) equipped with complex vector bundle E on M (such a correspondence is called \emph{a cobordism bicycle of vector bundle}) and we extend BFM-RR to this enriched category \mathscr M_{*,*}(\mathscr V)^+_{\otimes} as well.
