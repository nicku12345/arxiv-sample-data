It is well known that braided monoidal categories are the categorical algebras of the little two-dimensional disks operad. We introduce involutive little disks operads, which are Z/2Z-orbifold versions of the little disks operads. We classify their categorical algebras and describe these explicitly in terms of a finite list of functors, natural isomorphisms and coherence equations. In dimension two, the categorical algebras are braided monoidal categories with an anti-involution together with a pointed module category carrying a universal solution to the (twisted) reflection equation. Main examples are obtained from the categories of representations of a ribbon Hopf algebra with an involution and a quasi-triangular coideal subalgebra, such as a quantum group and a quantum symmetric pair coideal subalgebra.
