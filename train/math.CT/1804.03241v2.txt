This paper is the second in a series of two papers about generalizing Quillen's Theorem A to strict \infty-categories. In the first one, we presented a proof of this Theorem A of a simplicial nature, direct but somewhat ad hoc. In the current paper, we give a conceptual proof of an \infty-categorical nature of the same theorem. This proof is based on the theory of join and slices for strict \infty-categories developed by the authors in a previous paper, and on a comma construction for strict \infty-categories generalizing classical comma categories and Gray's comma 2-categories. This \infty-categorical comma construction is used by the first author in another paper to prove a generalization of Quillen's Theorem B to strict \infty-categories. We believe that the importance of this comma construction in the theory of \infty-categories goes far beyond the scope of homotopy theory.
