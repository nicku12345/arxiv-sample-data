We define and study opfibrations of V-enriched categories when V is an extensive monoidal category whose unit is terminal and connected. This includes sets, simplicial sets, categories, or any locally cartesian closed category with disjoint coproducts and connected unit. We show that for an ordinary category B, there is an equivalence of 2-categories between V-enriched opfibrations over the free V-category on B, and pseudofunctors from B to the 2-category of V-categories. This generalizes the classical (Set-enriched) Grothendieck correspondence.
