We define a homotopy relation between arrows of a category with weak equivalences, and give a condition under which the quotient by the homotopy relation yields the homotopy category. In the case of the fibrant-cofibrant objects of a model category this condition holds, and we show that our notion of homotopy coincides with the classical one. We also show that Quillen's construction of the homotopy category of a model category, in which the arrows are homotopical classes of a single arrow between fibrant-cofibrant objects, can be made as well for categories with weak equivalences using this notion of homotopy. We deduce from our work the saturation of model categories. The proofs of these results, which consider only the weak equivalences, become simpler (as it is usually the case) than those who involve the whole structure of a model category.
