We outline a definition of accessible and presentable objects in a 2-category \mathcal K endowed with a "KZ context", that is to say a pair of well-interacting lax-idempotent monads; this perspective suggests a unified treatment of many "Gabriel-Ulmer like" theorems, asserting how presentable objects arise as reflections of generating ones. We outline the notion of "(Gabriel-Ulmer) envelope" for a KZ context, sufficient to concoct Gabriel-Ulmer duality. We end the paper with a roundup of examples, involving classical (set-based and enriched), low dimensional and a perspective for future work, rooted in higher category theory and homotopy.
