We begin by giving a nonstandard description of the construction of the classical tautological, or endomorphism, operad taut(X) on a set X. We then describe how globular operads are a strict generalization of classical operads. From this perspective a description is given of the analogous construction for the tautological globular operad Taut(\mathcal{X}) on a globular set \mathcal{X} by way of describing the internal hom function for the monoids category \textbf{Col}, of collections and collection homomorphisms, with respect to the monoidal composition tensor product used to define globular operads.
