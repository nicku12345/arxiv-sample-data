We describe several equivalent models for the infinity-category of infinity-local systems of chain complexes over a space using the framework of quasi-categories. We prove that the given models are equivalent as infinity-categories by exploiting the relationship between the differential graded nerve functor and the cobar construction. We use one of these models to calculate the quasi-categorical colimit of an infinity-local system in terms of a twisted tensor product.
