The Fa\`a di Bruno construction, introduced by Cockett and Seely, constructs a comonad \mathsf{Fa{\grave{a}}} whose coalgebras are precisely Cartesian differential categories. In other words, for a Cartesian left additive category \mathbb{X}, \mathsf{Fa{\grave{a}}}(\mathbb{X}) is the cofree Cartesian differential category over \mathbb{X}. Composition in these cofree Cartesian differential categories is based on the Fa\`a di Bruno formula, and corresponds to composition of differential forms. This composition, however, is somewhat complex and difficult to work with. In this paper we provide an alternative construction of cofree Cartesian differential categories inspired by tangent categories. In particular, composition defined here is based on the fact that the chain rule for Cartesian differential categories can be expressed using the tangent functor, which simplifies the formulation of the higher order chain rule.
