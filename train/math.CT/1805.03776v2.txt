The notion of an extriangulated category gives a unification of existing theories in exact or abelian categories and in triangulated categories. In this article, we develop Auslander--Reiten theory for extriangulated categories. This unifies Auslander--Reiten theories developed in exact categories and triangulated categories independently. We give two different sets of sufficient conditions on the extriangulated category so that existence of almost-split extensions becomes equivalent to that of an Auslander--Reiten--Serre duality. We also show that existence of almost-split extensions is preserved under taking relative extriangulated categories, ideal quotients, and extension-closed subcategories. Moreover, we prove that the stable category \underline{\mathscr{C}} of an extriangulated category \mathscr{C} is a \tau-category if \mathscr{C} has almost split extensions and source morphisms. This gives various consequences on \underline{\mathscr{C}}, including Igusa--Todorov's Radical Layers Theorem. In particular, the associated completely graded category of \underline{\mathscr{C}} is equivalent to the complete mesh category of the Auslander-Reiten species of \underline{\mathscr{C}}.
