This note concerns the category \Box of cartesian cubes with connections, equivalently the full subcategory of posets on objects [1]^n with n \geq 0. We show that the idempotent completion of \Box consists of finite complete posets. It follows that cubical sets, ie presheaves over \Box, are equivalent to presheaves over finite complete posets. This yields an alternative exposition of a result by Kapulkin and Voevodsky that simplicial sets form a subtopos of cubical sets.
