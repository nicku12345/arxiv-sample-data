In 2004 and 2005 Enochs et al. characterized the flat and projective quiver-representations of left rooted quivers. The proofs can be understood as filtering the classes \Phi(\operatorname{Add}\mathscr X) and \Phi(\varinjlim\mathscr X) when \mathscr X is the finitely generated projective modules over a ring. In this paper we generalize the above and show that \Phi(\mathscr X) can always be filtered for any class \mathscr X in any AB5-abelian category. With an emphasis on \Phi(\varinjlim\mathscr X) we investigate the Gorenstein homological situation. Using an abstract version of Pontryagin duals in abelian categories we give a more general characterization of the flat representations and end up by describing the Gorenstein flat quiver representations over right coherent rings.
