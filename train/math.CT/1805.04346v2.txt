Given a locally presentable enriched category \mathcal{E} together with a small dense full subcategory \mathcal A of arities, we study the relationship between monads on \mathcal E and identity-on-objects functors out of \mathcal A, which we call \mathcal A-pretheories. We show that the natural constructions relating these two kinds of structure form an adjoint pair. The fixpoints of the adjunction are characterised as the \mathcal A-nervous monads---those for which the conclusions of Weber's nerve theorem hold---and the \mathcal A-theories, which we introduce here.   The resulting equivalence between \mathcal A-nervous monads and \mathcal A-theories is best possible in a precise sense, and extends almost all previously known monad--theory correspondences. It also establishes some completely new correspondences, including one which captures the globular theories defining Grothendieck weak \omega-groupoids.   Besides establishing our general correspondence and illustrating its reach, we study good properties of \mathcal A-nervous monads and \mathcal A-theories that allow us to recognise and construct them with ease. We also compare them with the monads with arities and theories with arities introduced and studied by Berger, Melli\`es and Weber.
