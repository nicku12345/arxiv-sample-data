We develop a homotopy theory of (small) homotopy functors from a combinatorial model category to simplicial sets and give a version of the classical theorem by Dwyer and Kan on comparison of model categories of homotopy functors. Moreover, we interpret the fibrant-projective model structure, as another model for homotopy theory of homotopy functors, provided that all object in the domain category are cofibrant.
