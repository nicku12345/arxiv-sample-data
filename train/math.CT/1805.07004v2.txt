In this paper, we use the language of pedigrads, introduced in previous work, to formalize the relationship between genotypes, phenotypes and haplotypes. We show how this formalism can help us localize the variations in the genotype that cause a given phenotype. We then use the concept of haplotype to formalize the process of predicting a certain phenotype for a given set of genotypes.
