We give analogues of the Auslander correspondence for two classes of triangulated categories satisfying certain finiteness conditions. The first class is triangulated categories with additive generators and we consider their endomorphism algebras as the Auslander algebras. For the second one, we introduce the notion of [1]-additive generators and consider their graded endormorphism algebras as the Auslander algebras. We give a homological characterization of the Auslander algebras for each class. Along the way, we also show that the algebraic triangle structures on the homotopy categories are unique up to equivalence.
