In this paper, we answer a question of Dwyer, Greenlees, and Iyengar by proving a local ring R is a complete intersection if and only if every complex of R-modules with finitely generated homology is proxy small. Moreover, we establish that a commutative noetherian ring R is locally a complete intersection if and only if every complex of R-modules with finitely generated homology is virtually small.
