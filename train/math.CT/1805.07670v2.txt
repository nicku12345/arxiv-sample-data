This paper considers the difficulty in the set-system approach to generalizing graph theory. These difficulties arise categorically as the category of set-system hypergraphs is shown not to be cartesian closed and lacks enough projective objects, unlike the category of directed multigraphs (i.e. quivers). The category of incidence hypergraphs is introduced as a "graph-like" remedy for the set-system issues so that hypergraphs may be studied by their locally graphic behavior via homomorphisms that allow an edge of the domain to be mapped into a subset of an edge in the codomain. Moreover, it is shown that the category of quivers embeds into the category of incidence hypergraphs via a logical functor that is the inverse image of an essential geometric morphism between the topoi. Consequently, the quiver exponential is shown to be simply represented using incidence hypergraph homomorphisms.
