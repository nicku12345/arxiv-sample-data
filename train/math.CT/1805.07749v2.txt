We give the definitions of model bicategory and q-homotopy, which are natural generalizations of the notions of model category and homotopy to the context of bicategories. For any model bicategory \mathcal{C}, denote by \mathcal{C}_{fc} the full sub-bicategory of the fibrant-cofibrant objects. We prove that the 2-dimensional localization of \mathcal{C} at the weak equivalences can be computed as a bicategory \mathcal{H}o(\mathcal{C}) whose objects and arrows are those of \mathcal{C}_{fc} and whose 2-cells are classes of q-homotopies up to an equivalence relation. When considered for a model category, q-homotopies coincide with the homotopies as considered by Quillen. The pseudofunctor \mathcal{C} \stackrel{q}{\longrightarrow} \mathcal{H}o(\mathcal{C}) which yields the localization is constructed by using a notion of fibrant-cofibrant replacement in this context. We include an appendix with a general result of independent interest on a transfer of structure for lax functors, that we apply to obtain a pseudofunctor structure for the fibrant-cofibrant replacement.
