If P is a dg-operad acting on a dg-algebra A via algebra homomorphisms, then P acts on the Hochschild complex of A. In the more general case when P is a dg-prop, we show that P still acts on the Hochschild complex, but only up to coherent homotopy. We moreover give a functorial dg-replacement of P that strictifies the action. As an application, we obtain an explicit strictification of the homotopy coherent commutative Hopf algebra structure on the Hochschild complex of a commutative Hopf algebra.
