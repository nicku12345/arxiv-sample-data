We introduce a notion of gluability for poset-indexed Bridgeland slicings on triangulated categories and show how a gluing abelian slicing on the heart of a bounded t-structure naturally induces a family of perverse t-structures. Our setup generalises the one of Collins and Polishchuk. As a corollary we recover several constructions from the theory of t-structures on triangulated categories. In particular we rediscover Levine's theorem: the Beilinson-Soul\'e vanishing conjecture implies the existence of Tate motives.
