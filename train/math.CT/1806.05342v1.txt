Given a bounded-above cochain complex of modules over a ring, it is standard to replace it by a projective resolution, and it is classical that doing so can be very useful.   Recently, a modified version of this was introduced in triangulated categories other than the derived category of a ring. A triangulated category is \emph{approximable} if this modified procedure is possible. Not surprisingly this has proved a powerful tool. For example: the fact that the derived category of a quasi compact, separated scheme is approximable has led to major improvements on old theorems due to Bondal, Van den Bergh and Rouquier. In this article we prove that, under weak hypotheses, the recollement of two approximable triangulated categories is approximable. In particular, this shows many of the triangulated categories that arise in noncommutative algebraic geometry are approximable.
