We revisit an old assertion due to Rouquier, characterizing the perfect complexes as bounded homological functors on the bounded complexes of coherent sheaves. The new results vastly generalize the old statement---first of all the ground ring is not restricted to be a field, any commutative, noetherian ring will do. But the generalization goes further, to the abstract world of approximable triangulated categories.
