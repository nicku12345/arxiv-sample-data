Fibrations over a category B, introduced to category theory by Grothendieck, encode pseudo-functors B^{op} \rightsquigarrow {\bf Cat}, while the special case of discrete fibrations encode presheaves B^{op} \to {\bf Set}. A two-sided discrete variation encodes functors B^{op} \times A \to {\bf Set}, which are also known as profunctors from A to B. By work of Street, all of these fibration notions can be defined internally to an arbitrary 2-category or bicategory. While the two-sided discrete fibrations model profunctors internally to {\bf Cat}, unexpectedly, the dual two-sided codiscrete cofibrations are necessary to model \cal V-profunctors internally to \cal V-\bf Cat.
