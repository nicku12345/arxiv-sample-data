These are lectures notes for a mini-course given at the conference Interactions of Quantum Affine Algebras with Cluster Algebras, Current Algebras, and Categorification in June 2018. The goal is to introduce the reader to string diagram techniques for monoidal categories, with an emphasis on their role in categorification.
