If \mathcal{C} is a cocomplete monoidal category in which tensoring from both sides preserves coequalizers, then the category of monoids over \mathcal{C} is cocomplete. The same holds if \mathcal{C} has regular factorizations and tensoring only preserves regular epimorphisms. As an application a lifting theorem for an adjunction with a monoidal right adjoint to an adjunction between the respective categories of monoids is proved.
