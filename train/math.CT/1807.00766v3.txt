Given a slightly degenerate fusion category \mathcal{C}, we explain how it naturally gives rise to a Z-modular data. We do not restrict to spherical categories and work with pivotal categories instead. Finally, we give an interpretation in this framework of the Bonnaf\'e-Rouquier categorification of the \mathbb{Z}-modular datum associated to non trivial family of the cyclic complex reflection group.
