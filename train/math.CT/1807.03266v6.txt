We prove and explain several classical formulae for homotopy (co)limits in general (combinatorial) model categories which are not necessarily simplicially enriched. Importantly, we prove versions of the Bousfield-Kan formula and the fat totalization formula in this complete generality. We finish with a proof that homotopy-final functors preserve homotopy limits, again in complete generality.
