It is well-known that the "pre-2-category" \mathscr{C}at_\mathrm{dg}^\mathrm{coh}(k) of small dg categories over a field k, with 1-morphisms defined as dg functors, and with 2-morphisms defined as the complexes of coherent natural transformations, fails to be a strict 2-category. In [T2], D.Tamarkin constructed a contractible 2-operad in the sense of M.Batanin [Ba3], acting on \mathscr{C}at_\mathrm{dg}^\mathrm{coh}(k). According to Batanin loc.cit., it is a possible way to define a "weak 2-category".   In this paper, we provide a construction of {\it another} contractible 2-operad \mathcal{O}, acting on \mathscr{C}at_\mathrm{dg}^\mathrm{coh}(k). Our main tool is the {\it twisted tensor product} of small dg categories, introduced in [Sh3]. We establish a one-side associativity for the twisted tensor product, making (\mathscr{C}at_\mathrm{dg}^\mathrm{coh}(k),\overset{\sim}{\otimes}) a skew monoidal category in the sense of [LS], and construct a {\it twisted composition} \mathscr{C}oh_\mathrm{dg}(D,E)\overset{\sim}{\otimes}\mathscr{C}oh_\mathrm{dg}(C,D)\to\mathscr{C}oh_\mathrm{dg}(C,E), and prove some compatibility between these two structures. Taken together, the two structures give rise to a 2-operad \mathcal{O}, acting on \mathscr{C}at_\mathrm{dg}^\mathrm{coh}(k). Its contractibility is a consequence of a general result of [Sh3].
