We give a collection of results regarding path types, identity types and univalent universes in certain models of type theory based on presheaves.   The main result is that path types cannot be used directly as identity types in any Orton-Pitts style model of univalent type theory with propositional truncation in presheaf assemblies over the first and second Kleene algebras.   We also give a Brouwerian counterexample showing that there is no constructive proof that there is an Orton-Pitts model of type theory in presheaves when the universe is based on a standard construction due to Hofmann and Streicher, and path types are identity types. A similar proof shows that path types are not identity types in internal presheaves in realizability toposes as long as a certain universe can be extended to a univalent one.   We show that one of our key lemmas has a purely syntactic variant in intensional type theory and use it to make some minor but curious observations on the behaviour of cofibrations in syntactic categories.
