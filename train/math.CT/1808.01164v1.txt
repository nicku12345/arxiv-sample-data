Given a quotient vector bundle \mathcal A over X with kernel map \kappa: X\to\mathrm{Max}\,A we study the codual bundle with fiber at each point x\in X isomorphic to the dual of \kappa(x). Applying the adjunction between quotient vector bundles and linearized locales to the codual bundle leads to a new adjunction between the category of all quotient vector bundles and a category whose objects are locales L equipped with a contravariant morphism L\to\mathrm{Max}\, A.
