Two adjoint functors can be seen as generalisations of the two functions within a Galois connection. If instead the adjoints are not generalised from functions, but from relations, then analogously the object of study becomes a more general notion of an adjunction. A suitable method to express such functor-level relations is to consider functors into categories of families. This structure is then used to show that the central exactness structure in self-dual group theory, consisting of a chain of adjunctions, holds also for the category of sets when seen in this general form.
