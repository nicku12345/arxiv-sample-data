We prove a generalization of Quillen's Theorem B to strict \infty-categories. More generally, we show that under similar hypothesis as for Theorem B, the comma construction for strict \infty-categories, that we introduced with Maltsiniotis in a previous paper, is the homotopy pullback with respect to Thomason equivalences. We give several applications of these results, including the construction of new models for certain Eilenberg-Mac Lane spaces.
