A Lie 2-group G is a category internal to the category of Lie groups. Consequently it is a monoidal category and a Lie groupoid. The Lie groupoid structure on G gives rise to the Lie 2-algebra \mathbb{X}(G) of multiplicative vector fields, see (Berwick-Evans -- Lerman). The monoidal structure on G gives rise to a left action of the 2-group G on the Lie groupoid G, hence to an action of G on the Lie 2-algebra \mathbb{X}(G). As a result we get the Lie 2-algebra \mathbb{X}(G)^G of left-invariant multiplicative vector fields. On the other hand there is a well-known construction that associates a Lie 2-algebra \mathfrak{g} to a Lie 2-group G: apply the functor \mathsf{Lie}: \mathsf{Lie Groups} \to \mathsf{Lie Algebras} to the structure maps of the category G. We show that the Lie 2-algebra \mathfrak{g} is isomorphic to the Lie 2-algebra \mathbb{X}(G)^G of left invariant multiplicative vector fields.
