For an exact category \mathcal{E} with enough projectives and with a d\mathbb{Z}-cluster tilting subcategory, we show that the singularity category of \mathcal{E} admits a d\mathbb{Z}-cluster tilting subcategory. To do this we introduce cluster tilting subcategories of left triangulated categories, and we show that there is a correspondence between cluster tilting subcategories of \mathcal{E} and \underline{\mathcal{E}}. We also deduce that the Gorenstein projectives of \mathcal{E} admit a d\mathbb{Z}-cluster tilting subcategory under some assumptions. Finally, we compute the d\mathbb{Z}-cluster tilting subcategory of the singularity category for a finite-dimensional algebra which is not Iwanaga-Gorenstein.
