In this study, we interpret the notion of homotopy of morphisms in the category of crossed modules in a category \mathsf{C} of groups with operations using the categorical equivalence between crossed modules and internal categories in \mathsf{C}. Further, we characterize the derivations of crossed modules in a category \mathsf{C} of groups with operations and obtain new crossed modules using regular derivations of old one.
