A formula for the modular data of \mathcal{Z}(Vec^{\omega}G) was given by Coste, Gannon and Ruelle in arXiv:hep-th/0001158, but without an explicit proof for arbitrary 3-cocycles. This paper presents a derivation using the representation category of the quasi Hopf algebra D^{\omega}G. Further, we have written code to compute this modular data for many pairs of small finite groups and 3-cocycles. This code is optimised using Galois symmetries of the S and T matrices. We have posted a database of modular data for the Drinfeld center of every Morita equivalence class of pointed fusion categories of dimension less than 64.
