Let \mathcal T be a well generated triangulated category, and let S\subset\mathcal T be a set of objects. We prove that there is a t-structure on \mathcal T with {\mathcal T}^{\leq0}=\overline{\langle S\rangle}^{(-\infty,0]}.   This article is an improvement on the main result of a 2003 article by Alonso, Jeremias and Souto---in that article the theorem was proved under the assumption that \mathcal T has a nice enough model. It should be mentioned that the theorem of Alonso, Jeremias and Souto has been influential---it turns out to be interesting to study all of these t-structures.
