The reachability semantics for Petri nets can be studied using open Petri nets. For us an "open" Petri net is one with certain places designated as inputs and outputs via a cospan of sets. We can compose open Petri nets by gluing the outputs of one to the inputs of another. Open Petri nets can be treated as morphisms of a category \mathsf{Open}(\mathsf{Petri}), which becomes symmetric monoidal under disjoint union. However, since the composite of open Petri nets is defined only up to isomorphism, it is better to treat them as morphisms of a symmetric monoidal double category \mathbb{O}\mathbf{pen}(\mathsf{Petri}). We describe two forms of semantics for open Petri nets using symmetric monoidal double functors out of \mathbb{O}\mathbf{pen}(\mathsf{Petri}). The first, an operational semantics, gives for each open Petri net a category whose morphisms are the processes that this net can carry out. This is done in a compositional way, so that these categories can be computed on smaller subnets and then glued together. The second, a reachability semantics, simply says which markings of the outputs can be reached from a given marking of the inputs.
