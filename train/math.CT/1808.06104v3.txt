This paper deals with the notion of weak Lawvere-Tierney topology on a topos. Our motivation to study such a notion is based on the observation that the composition of two Lawvere-Tierney topologies is no longer idempotent, when seen as a closure operator. For a given topos \mathcal{E}, in this paper we investigate some properties of this notion. Among other things, it is shown that the set of all weak Lawvere-Tierney topologies on \mathcal{E} constitutes a complete residuated lattice provided that \mathcal{E} is (co)complete. Furthermore, when the weak Lawvere-Tierney topology on \mathcal{E} preserves binary meets we give an explicit description of the (restricted) associated sheaf functor on \mathcal{E}.
