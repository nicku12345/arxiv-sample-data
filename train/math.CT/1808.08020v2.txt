We relate the relative nerve \mathrm{N}_f(\mathcal{D}) of a diagram of simplicial sets f \colon \mathcal{D} \to \mathsf{sSet} with the Grothendieck construction \mathsf{Gr} F of a simplicial functor F \colon \mathcal{D} \to \mathsf{sCat} in the case where f = \mathrm{N} F. We further show that any strict monoidal simplicial category \mathcal{C} gives rise to a functor \mathcal{C}^\bullet \colon \Delta^\mathrm{op} \to \mathsf{sCat}, and that the relative nerve of \mathrm{N} \mathcal{C}^\bullet is the operadic nerve \mathrm{N}^\otimes(\mathcal{C}). Finally, we show that all the above constructions commute with appropriately defined opposite functors.
