Suppose an extension map U\colon \mathbb{T}_1 \to \mathbb{T}_0 in the 2-category \mathfrak{Con} of contexts for arithmetic universes satisfies a Chevalley criterion for being an (op)fibration in \mathfrak{Con}. If M is a model of \mathbb{T}_0 in an elementary topos \mathcal{S} with nno, then the classifier p\colon\mathcal{S}[\mathbb{T}_1/M]\to\mathcal{S} satisfies Johnstone's criterion for being an (op)fibration in the 2-category \mathcal{E}\mathfrak{Top} of elementary toposes (with nno) and geometric morphisms. Along the way, we provide a convenient reformulation of Johnstone's criterion.
