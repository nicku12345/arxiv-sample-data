In this paper we prove that various quasi-categories whose objects are \infty-categories in a very general sense are complete: admitting limits indexed by all simplicial sets. This result and others of a similar flavor follow from a general theorem in which we characterize the data that is required to define a limit cone in a quasi-category constructed as a homotopy coherent nerve. Since all quasi-categories arise this way up to equivalence, this analysis covers the general case. Namely, we show that quasi-categorical limit cones may be modeled at the point-set level by pseudo homotopy limit cones, whose shape is governed by the weight for pseudo limits over a homotopy coherent diagram but with the defining universal property up to equivalence, rather than isomorphism, of mapping spaces. Our applications follow from the fact that the (\infty,1)-categorical core of an \infty-cosmos admits weighted homotopy limits for all flexible weights, which includes in particular the weight for pseudo cones.
