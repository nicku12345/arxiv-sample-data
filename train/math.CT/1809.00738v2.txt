Bidirectional data accessors such as lenses, prisms and traversals are all instances of the same general 'optic' construction. We give a careful account of this construction and show that it extends to a functor from the category of symmetric monoidal categories to itself. We also show that this construction enjoys a universal property: it freely adds counit morphisms to a symmetric monoidal category. Missing in the folklore is a general definition of 'lawfulness' that applies directly to any optic category. We provide such a definition and show that it is equivalent to the folklore profunctor optic laws.
