Let H be a finite-dimensional pivotal and unimodular Hopf algebra over a field k. It was shown in [BBGa] that the projective tensor ideal in H-mod admits a unique non-degenerate modified trace, a natural generalisation of the categorical trace. This paper provides an extension of this result to a much more general setting. We first extend the notion of the modified trace to the so-called module trace for a given k-linear module category M over a pivotal category C equipped with a module endofunctor. We provide a non-trivial class of examples of such module traces. In particular, we show that any finite-dimensional pivotal Hopf k-algebra, not necessarily unimodular, admits a non-degenerate module trace on its projective tensor ideal. We also extend this result to pivotal Hopf group-coalgebras of finite type, and we give explicit calculations for the family of Taft Hopf algebras and non-restricted Borel quantum groups at roots of unity.
