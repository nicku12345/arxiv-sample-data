For a triangulated category T, if C is a cluster-tilting subcategory of T, then the quotient category T\C is an abelian category. Under certain conditions, the converse also holds. This is an very important result of cluster-tilting theory, due to Koenig-Zhu and Beligiannis.   Now let B be a suitable extriangulated category, which is a simultaneous generalization of triangulated categories and exact categories. We introduce the notion of pre-cluster tilting subcategory C of B, which is a generalization of cluster tilting subcategory. We show that C is cluster tilting if and only if B/C is abelian.
