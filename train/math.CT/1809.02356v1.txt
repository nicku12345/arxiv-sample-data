The forgetful functor \mathscr{U}:\mathscr{V}^\mathscr{G}\rightarrow \mathscr{V} from the monoidal category of Eilenberg-Moore coalgebras for a cocontinuous Hopf comonad \mathscr{G} induces a change of base functor \widetilde{\mathscr{U}}:\mathscr{V}^\mathscr{G}\text{-}\mathrm{Mod}\rightarrow \mathscr{V}\text{-}\mathrm{Mod} that creates left Kan extensions. This has implications for characterizing the absolute colimit completion of \mathscr{V}^\mathscr{G}-categories. A motivating example was the category of differential graded abelian groups obtained as the category of coalgebras for a Hopf monoid in the category of abelian groups.
