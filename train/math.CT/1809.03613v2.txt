We give two alternate presentations of the Frobenius Heisenberg category, \mathcal{Heis}_{F,k}, defined by Savage, when the Frobenius algebra F=F_1\oplus\dotsb\oplus F_n decomposes as a direct sum of Frobenius subalgebras. In these alternate presentations, the morphism spaces of \mathcal{Heis}_{F,k} are given in terms of planar diagrams consisting of strands "colored" by integers i=1,\dotsc,n, where a strand of color i carries tokens labelled by elements of F_i. In addition, we prove that when F decomposes this way, the tensor product of Frobenius Heisenberg categories, \mathcal{Heis}_{F_1,k}\otimes\dotsb\otimes\mathcal{Heis}_{F_n,k}, is equivalent to a certain subcategory of the Karoubi envelope of \mathcal{Heis}_{F,k} that we call the \textit{partial} Karoubi envelope of \mathcal{Heis}_{F,k}.
