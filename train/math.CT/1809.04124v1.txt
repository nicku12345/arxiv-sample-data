Following the concept of topological theory of S.~E.~Rodabaugh, this paper introduces a new approach to (lattice-valued) bornology, which is based in bornological theories, and which is called variety-based bornology. In particular, motivated by the notion of topological system of S.~Vickers, we introduce the concept of variety-based bornological system, and show that the category of variety-based bornological spaces is isomorphic to a full reflective subcategory of the category of variety-based bornological systems.
