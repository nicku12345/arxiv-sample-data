Recently, J.~T.~Denniston, A.~Melton, and S.~E.~Rodabaugh introduced a lattice-valued analogue of the concept of institution of J.~A.~Goguen and R.~M.~Burstall, comparing it, moreover, with the (lattice-valued version of the) notion of topological system of S.~Vickers. In this paper, we show that a suitable generalization of topological systems provides a convenient framework for doing certain kinds of (lattice-valued) institutions.
