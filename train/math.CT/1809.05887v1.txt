Motivated by the concept of Sierpinski object for topological systems of S.~Vickers, presented recently by R.~Noor and A.~K.~Srivastava, this paper introduces the Sierpinski object for many-valued topological systems and shows that it has three important properties of the crisp Sierpinski space of general topology.
