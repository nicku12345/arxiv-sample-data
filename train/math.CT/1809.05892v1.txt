We develop foundations for the category theory of \infty-categories parametrized by a base \infty-category. Our main contribution is a theory of indexed homotopy limits and colimits, which specializes to a theory of G-colimits for G a finite group when the base is chosen to be the orbit category of G. We apply this theory to show that the G-\infty-category of G-spaces is freely generated under G-colimits by the contractible G-space, thereby affirming a conjecture of Mike Hill.
