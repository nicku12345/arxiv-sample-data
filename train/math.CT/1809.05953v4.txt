Through careful analysis of an argument of Brooke-Taylor and Rosicky, we show that the powerful image of any accessible functor is closed under colimits of \kappa-chains, \kappa a sufficiently large almost measurable cardinal. This condition on powerful images, by methods resembling those of Lieberman and Rosicky, implies \kappa-locality of Galois types. As this, in turn, implies sufficient measurability of \kappa, via a paper of Boney and Unger, we obtain an equivalence: a purely category-theoretic characterization of almost measurable cardinals.
