In this paper we apply some tools developed in our previous work on Grothendieck \infty-groupoids to the finite-dimensional case of weak 3-groupoids.   We obtain a semi-model structure on the category of Grothendieck 3-groupoids of suitable type, thanks to the construction of an endofunctor \mathbb{P} that has enough structure to behave like a path object. This makes use of a recognition principle we prove here that characterizes globular theories whose models can be viewed as Grothendieck n-groupoids (for 0\leq n \leq \infty). Finally, we prove that the obstruction in arbitrary dimension (possibly infinite) only resides in the construction of (slightly less than) a path object on a suitable category of Grothendieck (weak) n-categories with weak inverses. This also gives a sufficient condition for endowing an n-groupoid \`a la Batanin with the structure of a Grothendieck n-groupoid.
