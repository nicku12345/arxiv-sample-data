Monoidal categories enriched in a braided monoidal category \mathcal{V} are classified by braided oplax monoidal functors from \mathcal{V} to the Drinfeld centers of ordinary monoidal categories. In this article, we prove that this classifying functor is strongly monoidal if and only if the original \mathcal{V}-monoidal category is tensored over \mathcal{V}. We then define a completion operation which produces a tensored \mathcal{V}-monoidal category \overline{\mathcal{C}} from an arbitrary \mathcal{V}-monoidal category \mathcal{C}, and we determine many equivalent conditions which imply \mathcal{C} and \overline{\mathcal{C}} are \mathcal{V}-monoidally equivalent.   Since being tensored is a property of the underlying \mathcal{V}-category of a \mathcal{V}-monoidal category, we begin by studying the equivalence between (tensored) \mathcal{V}-categories and oplax (strong) \mathcal{V}-module categories respectively. We then define the completion operation for \mathcal{V}-categories, and adapt these results to the \mathcal{V}-monoidal setting.
