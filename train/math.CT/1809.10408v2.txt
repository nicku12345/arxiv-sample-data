We prove that Mal'tsev and Goursat categories may be characterised through stronger variations of the Shifting Lemma, that is classically expressed in terms of three congruences R, S and T, and characterises congruence modular varieties. We first show that a regular category \mathcal C is a Mal'tsev category if and only if the Shifting Lemma holds for reflexive relations on the same object in \mathcal C. Moreover, we prove that a regular category \mathcal C is a Goursat category if and only if the Shifting Lemma holds for a reflexive relation S and reflexive and positive relations R and T in \mathcal C. In particular this provides a new characterisation of 2-permutable and 3-permutable varieties and quasi-varieties of universal algebras.
