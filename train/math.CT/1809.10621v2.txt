We prove the existence of a model structure on the category of stratified simplicial sets whose fibrant objects are precisely n-complicial sets, which are a proposed model for (\infty,n)-categories, based on previous work of Verity and Riehl. We then construct a Quillen equivalent model based on simplicial presheaves over a category that can facilitate the comparison with other established models.
