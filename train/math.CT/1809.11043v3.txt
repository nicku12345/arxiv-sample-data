We generalise some of the theory developed for abelian categories in papers of Auslander and Reiten to semi-abelian and quasi-abelian categories. In addition, we generalise some Auslander-Reiten theory results of S. Liu for Krull-Schmidt categories by removing the Hom-finite and indecomposability restrictions. Finally, we give equivalent characterisations of Auslander-Reiten sequences in a quasi-abelian, Krull-Schmidt category.
