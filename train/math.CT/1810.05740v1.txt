In this thesis, we introduce a new cohomology theory associated to a Lie 2-algebras and a new cohomology theory associated to a Lie 2-group. These cohomology theories are shown to extend the classical cohomology theories of Lie algebras and Lie groups in that their second groups classify extensions. We use this fact together with an adapted van Est map to prove the integrability of Lie 2-algebras anew.
