Let X be a Noetherian separated and finite dimensional scheme over a field \mathbb{K} of characteristic zero. The goal of this paper is to study deformations of X over a differential graded local Artin \mathbb{K}-algebra by using local Tate-Quillen resolutions, i.e., the algebraic analog of the Palamodov's resolvent of a complex space. The above goal is achieved by describing the DG-Lie algebra controlling deformation theory of a diagram of differential graded commutative algebras, indexed by a direct Reedy category.
