For each n \geq -1, a quasi-category is said to be n-truncated if its hom-spaces are (n-1)-types. In this paper we study the model structure for n-truncated quasi-categories, which we prove can be constructed as the Bousfield localisation of Joyal's model structure for quasi-categories with respect to the boundary inclusion of the (n+2)-simplex. Furthermore, we prove the expected Quillen equivalences between categories and 1-truncated quasi-categories and between n-truncated quasi-categories and Rezk's (n,1)-\Theta-spaces.
