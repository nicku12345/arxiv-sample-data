Let \mathcal{M} be an abelian model category (in the sense of Hovey). For a large class of quivers, we describe associated abelian model structures on categories of quiver representations with values in \mathcal{M}. This is based on recent work of Holm and J{\o}rgensen on cotorsion pairs in categories of quiver representations. An application on Ding projective and Ding injective representations of quivers over Ding-Chen rings is given.
