In this paper, we characterize the local T0 and T1 separation axioms for quantale-valued gauge space, show how these concepts are related to each other and apply them to L-approach space and L-approach system. Furthermore, we give the characterization of a closed point and D-connectedness in quantale-valued gauge space. Finally, we compare all these concepts with other.
