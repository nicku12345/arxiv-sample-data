Using generalized enriched categories, in this paper we show that Rosick\'{y}'s proof of cartesian closedness of the exact completion of the category of topological spaces can be extended to a wide range of topological categories over \mathsf{Set}, like metric spaces, approach spaces, ultrametric spaces, probabilistic metric spaces, and bitopological spaces. In order to do so we prove a sufficient criterion for exponentiability of (\mathbb{T},V)-categories and show that, under suitable conditions, every (\mathbb{T},V)-injective category is exponentiable in (\mathbb{T},V)\text{-}\mathsf{Cat}.
