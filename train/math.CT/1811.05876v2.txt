The Noether isomorphism theorems and the Zassenhaus Lemma from group theory have a non-pointed version in a suitable categorical context first considered by W. Tholen in his PhD thesis. This article leads to a unification of these results with the ones in the pointed categorical context considered by O. Wyler, by working in the framework of star-regular categories introduced by M. Gran, Z. Janelidze and A. Ursini. Some concrete examples of categories where these results hold are examined in detail.
