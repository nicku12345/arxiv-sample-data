We study track categories (i.e., groupoid-enriched categories) endowed with additive structure similar to that of a 1-truncated DG-category, except that composition is not assumed right linear. We show that if such a track category is right linear up to suitably coherent correction tracks, then it is weakly equivalent to a 1-truncated DG-category. This generalizes work of the first author on the strictification of secondary cohomology operations. As an application, we show that the secondary integral Steenrod algebra is strictifiable.
