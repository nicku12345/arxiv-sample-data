In this paper we carry the construction of equilogical spaces into an arbitrary category \mathsf{X} topological over \mathsf{Set}, introducing the category \mathsf{X}-\mathsf{Equ} of equilogical objects. Similar to what is done for the category \mathsf{Top} of topological spaces and continuous functions, we study some features of the new category as (co)completeness and regular (co-)well-poweredness, as well as the fact that, under some conditions, it is a quasitopos. We achieve these various properties of the category \mathsf{X}-\mathsf{Equ} by representing it as a category of partial equilogical objects, as a reflective subcategory of the exact completion \mathsf{X}_{_{{\rm ex}}}, and as the regular completion \mathsf{X}_{_{{\rm reg}}}. We finish with examples in the particular cases, amongst others, of ordered, metric, and approach spaces, which can all be described using the (\mathbb{T},\mathsf{V})-\mathsf{Cat} setting.
