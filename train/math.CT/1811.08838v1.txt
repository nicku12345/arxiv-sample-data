In this paper we present classifying toposes for the following theories: the theory of \mathcal{C}^{\infty}-rings, the theory of local \mathcal{C}^{\infty}-rings and the theory of von Neumann regular \mathcal{C}^{\infty}-rings. The classifying toposes for the first two theories were stated without proof by Ieke Moerdijk and Gonzalo Reyes on the page 366 of \cite{MSIA}, where they assert that the topos {\rm \bf Set}^{\mathcal{C}^{\infty}{\rm \bf Rng}_{\rm fp}} classifies the theory of \mathcal{C}^{\infty}-rings and that the smooth Zariski topos classifies the theory of local \mathcal{C}^{\infty}-rings.
