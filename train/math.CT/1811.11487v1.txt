Let R be an associative ring with unit. Given an R-module M, we can associate the following covariant functor from the category of R-algebras to the category of abelian groups: S\mapsto M\otimes_R S. With the corresponding notion of dual functor, we prove that the natural morphism of functors \,\mathcal M\to \mathcal M^{\vee\vee}\, is an isomorphism. We prove several characterizations of the functors associated with flat modules, flat Mittag-Leffler modules and projective modules.
