In any symmetric monoidal 1-category the trace assigns to an endomorphism of a dualisable object an endomorphisms of the unit object. The trace is natural with respect to symmetric monoidal functors and it is cyclic: Tr(f g) = Tr(g f). We define an infinity-categorical tracelike transformation to be a natural and cyclic family of such assignments for all dualisable objects in symmetric monoidal (infinity,1)-categories.   Using the cobordism hypothesis in dimension 1 we relate the space of tracelike transformations to the moduli space of closed 1-manifolds with maps to the standard circle. This computation in particular implies that there is an essentially unique tracelike transformation generalising the trace from linear algebra to the world of (infinity,1)-categories. As an application we recover the cyclicity of THH.   We make no claim to originality. Much of what is presented can be extracted from the work of To\"en and Vezzosi. See the end of the introduction for more details.
