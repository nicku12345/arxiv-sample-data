In the context of infinity categories, we rethink the notion of derived functor in terms of correspondences. This is especially convenient for the description of a passage from an adjoint pair (F,G) of functors to a derived adjoint pair (LF,RG). In particular, canonicity of this passage becomes obvious.   2nd version: added comparison to Deligne's definition (SGA4) and a discussion of diagrams of derived functors. Introduction rewritten and references added.   3rd version: description of Kan extensions in terms of correspondences more detailed.   4th version: the final version accepted to HHA.
