The development of mathematics has been characterized by the increasing interconnectivity of seemingly separate disciplines. Such interplay has been facilitated by a massive development in formalism; category theory has provided a common language to the study of mathematics. In the opposite direction, we have seen algebraic topology and category theory synthesize via higher category theory. In this expository paper, we examine an application of higher category theory to geometry through the development of simplicial rings and derived schemes.
