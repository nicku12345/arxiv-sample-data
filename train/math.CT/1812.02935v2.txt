Our aim is to set up the cornerstones of Koszul duality in general operadic categories. In particular, we will prove that operads (in our generalized sense) governing the most important operad- and/or PROP-like structures as classical operads, their variants as cyclic, modular or wheeled operads, and also diverse versions of PROPs such as properads, dioperads, 1/2-PROPs, and still more exotic stuff as permutads and pre-permutads are quadratic, and describe their Koszul duals.   To this end we single out some additional properties of operadic categories ensuring that free operads admit a nice explicit description, and investigate how these properties interact with discrete operadic (op)fibrations which we use as a mighty tool to construct new operadic categories from the old ones. Particular attention is payed to the operadic category of graphs and to its clones, but several other examples are given as well.   Our present work provides an answer to the questions "What does encode a type of operads?" and "How to construct Koszul duals to these objects?" formulated in the last Loday's 2012 talk in Lille.
