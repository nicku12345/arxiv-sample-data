In this paper, we apply an explicit construction of a simplicial powering in dg-categories, due to Holstein (2016) and Arkhipov and Poliakova (2018), as well as our own results on homotopy ends (Arkhipov and {\O}rsted 2018), to obtain an explicit model for the homotopy limit of a cosimplicial system of dg-categories. We apply this to obtain a model for homotopy descent in terms of \mathrm{A}_{\infty}-comodules, proving a conjecture by Block, Holstein, and Wei (2017) in the process.
