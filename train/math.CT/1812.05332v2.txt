We define a class of morphisms between strict \omega-categories called discrete Conduch{\'e} \omega-functors that generalize discrete Conduch{\'e} functors between 1-categories and we study their properties related to polygraphs. The main result we prove is that for every discrete Conduch{\'e} \omega-functor, if its target is a free strict \omega-category on a polygraph then so is its source.
