The collection of open sets of a topological space forms a Heyting algebra, which leads to the idea of a Heyting algebra as a generalized topological space. In fact, a sober topological space may be reconstructed from its locale of open sets. This has given rise to a good theory of presheaves and sheaves over locales. At the same time, several ring like properties of Heyting algebras have also been studied. The purpose of this paper is to study a non-abelian homological theory for modules over Heyting algebras.
