We introduce the notions of Strongly harmonic and Gelfand module, as a generalization of the well-known ring theoretic case. We prove some properties of these modules and we give a characterization via their lattice of submodules and their space of maximal submodules. It is also observed that, under some assumptions, the space of maximal submodules of a strongly harmonic module constitutes a compact Hausdorff space whose frame of open sets is isomorphic to the frame \Psi(M) defined in [arXiv:1612.07407]. Finally, we mention some open questions that arose during this investigation.
