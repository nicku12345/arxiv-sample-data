Among cocomplete categories, the locally presentable ones can be defined as those with a strong generator consisting of presentable objects. Assuming Vop{\v{e}}nka's Principle, we prove that a cocomplete category is locally presentable iff it has a colimit dense subcategory and a generator consisting of presentable objects. We further show that a 3-element set is colimit-dense in \Set^{\op}, and spaces of countable dimension are colimit-dense in \Vec^{op}.
