In this paper, we study modules over quotient spaces of certain categorified fiber bundles. These are understood as modules over entwining structures involving a small K-linear category \mathcal D and a K-coalgebra C. We obtain Frobenius and separability conditions for functors on entwined modules. We also introduce the notion of a C-Galois extension \mathcal E\subseteq \mathcal D of categories. Under suitable conditions, we show that entwined modules over a C-Galois extension may be described as modules over the subcategory \mathcal E of C-coinvariants of \mathcal D.
