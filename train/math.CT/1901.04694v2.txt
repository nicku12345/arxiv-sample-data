In this study, internal categories in the category of the crossed modules are characterized and it has been shown that there is a natural equivalence between the category of the crossed modules over crossed modules, i.e. crossed squares, and the category of the internal categories within the category of crossed modules. Finally, we obtain examples of crossed squares using this equivalence.
