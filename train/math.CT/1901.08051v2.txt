Persistent homology enables fast and computable comparison of topological objects. However, it is naturally limited to the analysis of topological spaces. We extend the theory of persistence, by guaranteeing robustness and computability to significant data types as simple graphs and quivers. We focus on categorical persistence functions that allow us to study in full generality strong kinds of connectedness such as clique communities, k-vertex and k-edge connectedness directly on simple graphs and monic coherent categories.
