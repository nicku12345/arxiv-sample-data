Let H be a Hopf algebra and let \mathcal D_H be a Hopf-module category. We describe the cocycles and coboundaries for the Hopf cyclic cohomology of \mathcal D_H, which correspond respectively to categorified cycles and vanishing cycles over \mathcal D_H. An important role in our work is played by semicategories, which are categories that may not contain identity maps. In particular, a cycle over \mathcal D_H consists of a differential graded H-module semicategory equipped with a trace on endomorphism groups satisfying some conditions. Using a pairing on cycles, we obtain a pairing HC^p(\mathcal{C}) \otimes HC^q(\mathcal{C}') \longrightarrow HC^{p+q}(\mathcal{C} \otimes \mathcal{C}') on cyclic cohomology groups for small k-linear categories \mathcal C and \mathcal C'.
