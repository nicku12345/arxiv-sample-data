The category of double categories and double functors is equipped with a symmetric closed monoidal structure. For any double category \mathbb A, the corresponding internal hom functor |[ \mathbb A,-]| sends a double category \mathbb B to the double category whose 0-cells are the double functors \mathbb A \to \mathbb B, whose horizontal and vertical 1-cells are the horizontal and vertical pseudotransformations, respectively, and whose 2-cells are the modifications. Some well-known functors of practical significance are checked to be compatible with this monoidal structure.
