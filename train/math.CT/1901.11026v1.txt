We prove that the KLR algebra associated with the cyclic quiver of length e is a subquotient of the KLR algebra associated with the cyclic quiver of length e+1. We also give a geometric interpretation of this fact. This result has an important application in the theory of categorical representations. We prove that a category with an action of \widetilde{\mathfrak{sl}}_{e+1} contains a subcategory with an action of \widetilde{\mathfrak{sl}}_{e}. We also give generalizations of these results to more general quivers and Lie types.
