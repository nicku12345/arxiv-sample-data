We introduce the notion of weighted limit in an arbitrary quasi-category, suitably generalizing ordinary limits in a quasi-category, and classical weighted limits in an ordinary category. This is accomplished by generalizing Joyal's approach: we identify a meaningful construction for the quasi-category of weighted cones over a diagram in a quasi-category, whose terminal object is the weighted limit of the considered diagram. When the quasi-category arises as the homotopy coherent nerve of a category enriched over Kan complexes, we use techniques by Riehl-Verity to show that the weighted limit agrees with the homotopy weighted limit in the sense of enriched category theory, for which explicit constructions are available. When the quasi-category is complete, tensored and cotensored over the quasi-category of spaces, we discuss a possible comparison of our definition of weighted limit with the approach by Gepner-Haugseng-Nikolaus.
