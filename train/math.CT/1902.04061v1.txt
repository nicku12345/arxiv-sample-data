We extend the theory of d-categories, by providing an explicit description of the right mapping spaces of the d-homotopy category of an \infty-category. Using this description, we deduce an invariant \infty-categorical characterization of the d-homotopy category. We then proceed to develop an analogous theory of d-operads, which model \infty-operads with (d -1)-truncated multi-mapping spaces, and prove analogous results for them.
