Integral categories were recently developed as a counterpart to differential categories. In particular, integral categories come equipped with an integration operator, known as an integral transformation, whose axioms generalize the basic integration identities from calculus such as integration by parts. However, the literature on integral categories contains no example that captures integration of arbitrary smooth functions: the closest are examples involving integration of polynomial functions. This paper fills in this gap by developing an example of an integral category whose integral transformation operates on smooth 1-forms. We also provide an alternative viewpoint on the differential structure of this key example, investigate derivations and coderelictions in this context, and prove that free C^{\infty}-rings are Rota-Baxter algebras.
