The notion of a weak duality involution on a bicategory was recently introduced by Shulman in [arXiv:1606.05058]. We construct a weak duality involution on the fully dualisable part of \text{Alg}, the Morita bicategory of finite-dimensional k-algebras. The 2-category \text{KV} of Kapranov-Voevodsky k-vector spaces may be equipped with a canonical strict duality involution. We show that the pseudofunctor \text{Rep}: \text{Alg}^{fd} \to \text{KV} sending an algebra to its category of finite-dimensional modules may be canonically equipped with the structure of a duality pseudofunctor. Thus \text{Rep} is a strictification in the sense of Shulman's strictification theorem for bicategories with a weak duality involution. Finally, we present a general setting for duality involutions on the Morita bicategory of algebras in a semisimple symmetric finite tensor category.
