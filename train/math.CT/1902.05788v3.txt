A simple criterion for a functor to be finitary is presented: we call F finitely bounded if for all objects X every finitely generated subobject of FX factorizes through the F-image of a finitely generated subobject of X. This is equivalent to F being finitary for all functors between `reasonable' locally finitely presentable categories, provided that F preserves monomorphisms. We also discuss the question when that last assumption can be dropped. The answer is affirmative for functors between categories such as Set, K-Vec (vector spaces), boolean algebras, and actions of any finite group either on Set or on K-Vec for fields K of characteristic 0.   All this generalizes to locally \lambda-presentable categories, \lambda-accessible functors and \lambda-presentable algebras. As an application we obtain an easy proof that the Hausdorff functor on the category of complete metric spaces is \aleph_1-accessible.
