In universal algebra, it is well known that varieties admitting a majority term admit several Mal'tsev-type characterizations. The main aim of this paper is to establish categorical counterparts of some of these characterizations for regular categories. We prove a categorical version of Bergman's Double-projection Theorem: a regular category is a majority category if and only if every subobject S of a finite product A_1 \times A_2 \times \cdots \times A_n is uniquely determined by its two-fold projections. We also establish a categorical counterpart of the Pairwise Chinese Remainder Theorem for algebras, and characterize regular majority categories by the classical congruence equation \alpha \cap (\beta \circ \gamma) = (\alpha \cap \beta) \circ (\alpha \cap \gamma) due to A.F.~Pixley.
