We extend nearness frames to posets representing bases and even subbases of T_1 spaces. This allows us to put a classic duality due to Wallman, between compact T_1 spaces and abstract simplicial complexes, into a general nearness framework. Within this framework we extend Wallman's duality to locally compact T_1 spaces and, with further modifications, to completely metrisable spaces. Moreover, we provide an elementary sublocale-free version of an admissibility condition due to Picado and Pultr and show how it strengthens Wallman's admissibility condition.
