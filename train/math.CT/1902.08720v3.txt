Dimitri Ara's 2-quasi-categories, which are certain presheaves over Andr\'{e} Joyal's 2-cell category \Theta_2, are an example of a concrete model that realises the abstract notion of (\infty,2)-category. In this paper, we prove that the 2-quasi-categories and the fibrations into them can be characterised using the inner horn inclusions and the equivalence extensions introduced by David Oury. These maps are more tractable than the maps that Ara originally used and therefore our result can serve as a combinatorial foundation for the study of 2-quasi-categories.
