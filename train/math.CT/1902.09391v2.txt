Let \kappa be a regular cardinal. We study Gabriel-Ulmer duality when one restricts the 2-category of locally \kappa-presentable categories with \kappa-accessible right adjoints to its locally full sub-2-category of \kappa-presentable Grothendieck topoi with geometric \kappa-accessible morphisms. In particular, we provide a full understanding of the locally full sub-2-category of the 2-category of \kappa-small cocomplete categories with \kappa-colimit preserving functors arising as the corresponding 2-category of presentations via the restriction. We analyse the relation of these presentations of Grothendieck topoi with site presentations and we show that the 2-category of locally \kappa-presentable Grothendieck topoi with geometric \kappa-accessible morphisms is a reflective sub-bicategory of the full sub-2-category of the 2-category of sites with morphisms of sites genearated by the weakly \kappa-ary sites in the sense of Shulman [37].
