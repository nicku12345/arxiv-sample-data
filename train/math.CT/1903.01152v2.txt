We develop bicategory theory in univalent foundations. Guided by the notion of univalence for (1-)categories studied by Ahrens, Kapulkin, and Shulman, we define and study univalent bicategories. To construct examples of univalent bicategories, we develop the notion of `displayed bicategories', an analog of displayed 1-categories introduced by Ahrens and Lumsdaine. Displayed bicategories allow us to construct univalent bicategories in a modular fashion. We demonstrate the applicability of this notion, and prove that several bicategories of interest are univalent. Among these are the bicategory of univalent categories with families and the bicategory of pseudofunctors between univalent bicategories. Furthermore, we show that every bicategory with univalent hom-category is weakly equivalent to a univalent bicategory. All of our work is formalized in Coq as part of the UniMath library of univalent mathematics.
