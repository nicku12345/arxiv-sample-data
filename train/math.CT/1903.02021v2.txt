We explain two related constructions on the data of two monoidal symmetric closed categories \mathscr{A} and \mathscr{E} and monoidal functors F: \mathscr{E}\to \mathscr{A} and G: \mathscr{A}\to \mathscr{E}.   In a first part, we recall and partly extend work of A. Kock: In case F is left-adjoint to G, and this adjunction is monoidal, we can equip the Eilenberg-Moore category \mathscr{E}^T for T being the canonical monad associated to the adjunction, with the structure of symmetric monoidal closed category, provided \mathscr{E} has equalizers and \mathscr{E}^T co-equalizers.   In a second part, inspired by the Chu-construction, we build a category \mathscr{R}_{G}, which is symmetric monoidal closed as well, under the condition that \mathscr{E} has pullbacks. Similarly we build a category \mathscr{L}^{F} which is symmetric monoidal closed under the condition that \mathscr{A} has what we call F-pushouts and F-pullbacks. In case F \dashv G is a monoidal adjunction, we show that \mathscr{L}^{F} and \mathscr{R}_{G} are isomorphic as symmetric monoidal closed categories. We show also how \mathscr{E}^T is related to both.
