A number of categories is presented that are algebraicly complete and cocomplete, i.e., every endofunctor has an initial algebra and a terminal coalgebra. For finitary set functors the initial algebra and terminal coalgebra are proved to carry a canonical partial order with the same conservative CPO-completion. And they also both carry a canonical ultrametric with the same Cauchy completion. Finally, for cardinals \lambda of countable cofinality we prove that all endofunctors of the category of sets of power at most \lambda are finitary.
