Let \mathcal{A} be a locally noetherian Grothendieck category. In this paper we define and study the section functor on \mathcal{A} with respect to an open subset of ASpec\mathcal{A}. Next we define and study local cohomology theory in \mathcal{A} in terms of the section functors. Finally we study abstract local cohomology functor on the derived category \mathcal{D}^+(\mathcal{A}).
