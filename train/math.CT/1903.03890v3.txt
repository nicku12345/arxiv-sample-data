The paper defines polynomials in a bicategory \mathscr{M}. Polynomials in bicategories \mathrm{Spn}\mathscr{C} \  of spans in a finitely complete category \mathscr{C} \  agree with polynomials in \mathscr{C} \  as defined by Nicola Gambino and Joachim Kock, and by Mark Weber. When \mathscr{M} is \textit{calibrated}, we obtain another bicategory \mathrm{Poly}\mathscr{M}. We see that polynomials in \mathscr{M} have representations as pseudofunctors \mathscr{M}^{\mathrm{op}}\to \mathrm{Cat}. Calibrations are produced for the bicategory of relations in a regular category and for the bicategory of two-sided modules (distributors) between categories thereby providing new examples of bicategories of "polynomials".
