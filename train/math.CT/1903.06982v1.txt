We introduce the notion of an enriched set, as an abstraction of enriched categories, and a category of enriched sets. The set of enriched sets is itself described as a set enriched over the category of enriched sets. We introduce a method for the construction of sets enriched over the set of enriched sets from a given enriched set with some addition data, and for "functors" from such enriched sets as should thereby arise to the enriched set of enriched sets.
