In previous work, we used an \infty-categorical version of ultraproducts to show that, for a fixed height n, the symmetric monoidal \infty-categories of E_{n,p}-local spectra are asymptotically algebraic in the prime p. In this paper, we prove the analogous result for the symmetric monoidal \infty-categories of K_{p}(n)-local spectra, where K_{p}(n) is Morava K-theory at height n and the prime p. This requires \infty-categorical tools suitable for working with compactly generated symmetric monoidal \infty-categories with non-compact unit. The equivalences that we produce here are compatible with the equivalences for the E_{n,p}-local \infty-categories.
