For a category \mathcal{C} with finite limits and a class \mathcal{S} of monomorphisms in \mathcal{C} that is pullback stable, contains all isomorphisms, is closed under composition, and has the strong left cancellation property, we use pullback stable \mathcal{S}-essential monomorphisms in \mathcal{C} to construct a spectral category \mathrm{Spec}(\mathcal{C},\mathcal{S}). We show that it has finite limits and that the canonical functor \mathcal{C}\to \mathrm{Spec}(\mathcal{C},\mathcal{S}) preserves finite limits. When \mathcal{C} is a normal category, assuming for simplicity that \mathcal{S} is the class of all monomorphisms in \mathcal{C}, we show that pullback stable \mathcal{S}-essential monomorphisms are the same as what we call subobject-essential monomorphisms.
