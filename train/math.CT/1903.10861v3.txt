In this paper, we introduce quotients of exact categories by percolating subcategories. This approach extends earlier localization theories by Cardenas and Schlichting for exact categories, allowing new examples. Let \mathcal{A} be a percolating subcategory of an exact category \mathcal{E}, the quotient \mathcal{E} {/\mkern-6mu/} \mathcal{A} is constructed in two steps. In the first step, we associate a set S_\mathcal{A} \subseteq \operatorname{Mor}(\mathcal{E}) to \mathcal{A} and consider the localization \mathcal{E}[S^{-1}_\mathcal{A}]. In general, \mathcal{E}[S_\mathcal{A}^{-1}] need not be an exact category, but will be a one-sided exact category. In the second step, we take the exact hull \mathcal{E} {/\mkern-6mu/} \mathcal{A} of \mathcal{E}[S_\mathcal{E}^{-1}]. The composition \mathcal{E} \rightarrow \mathcal{E}[S_\mathcal{A}^{-1}] \rightarrow \mathcal{E} {/\mkern-6mu/} \mathcal{A} satisfies the 2-universal property of a quotient in the 2-category of exact categories.   We formulate our results in slightly more generality, allowing to start from a one-sided exact category. Additionally, we consider a type of percolating subcategories which guarantee that the morphisms of the set S_\mathcal{A} are admissible.   In upcoming work, we show that these localizations induce Verdier localizations on the level of the bounded derived category.
