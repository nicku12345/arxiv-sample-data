We introduce the notion of residual finiteness for categories. In analogy with the group-theoretic setting, we prove that free categories and finitely generated subcategories of finite-dimensional vector spaces are residually finite. Moreover, finitely generated residually finite categories are Hopfian and finitely presented residually finite categories have solvable word problem.
