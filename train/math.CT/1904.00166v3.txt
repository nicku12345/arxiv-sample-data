We present an algorithm for approximating linear categories of partitions (of sets). We report on concrete computer experiments based on this algorithm which we used to obtain first examples of so-called non-easy linear categories of partitions. All of the examples that we constructed are proven to be indeed new and non-easy. We interpret some of the new categories in terms of quantum group anticommutative twists.
