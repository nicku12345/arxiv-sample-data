This chapter, written for "Stable categories and structured ring spectra," edited by Andrew J. Blumberg, Teena Gerhardt, and Michael A. Hill, surveys the history of homotopical categories, from Gabriel and Zisman's categories of fractions to Quillen's model categories, through Dwyer and Kan's simplicial localizations and culminating in (\infty,1)-categories, first introduced through concrete models and later re-conceptualized in a model-independent framework. This reader is not presumed to have prior acquaintance with any of these concepts. Suggested exercises are included to fertilize intuitions and copious references point to external sources with more details. A running theme of homotopy limits and colimits is included to explain the kinds of problems homotopical categories are designed to solve as well as technical approaches to these problems.
