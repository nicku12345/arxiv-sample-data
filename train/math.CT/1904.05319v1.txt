Affine structures on a Lie groupoid, including affine k-vector fields, k-forms and (p,q)-tensors are studied. We show that the space of affine structures is a 2-vector space over the space of multiplicative structures. Moreover, the space of affine multivector fields has a natural graded strict Lie 2-algebra structure and affine (1,1)-tensors constitute a strict monoidal category. Such higher structures can be seen as the categorification of multiplicative structures on a Lie groupoid.
