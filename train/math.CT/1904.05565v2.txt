Inspired by the theory of apartness relations of Scott, we establish a positive theory of dissimilarity valued in an involutive quantale \mathsf{Q} without the aid of negation. It is demonstrated that a set equipped with a \mathsf{Q}-valued dissimilarity is precisely a symmetric category enriched in a subquantaloid of the quantaloid of back diagonals of \mathsf{Q}. Interactions between \mathsf{Q}-valued dissimilarities and \mathsf{Q}-valued similarities (which are equivalent to \mathsf{Q}-valued equalities in the sense of H{\"o}hle--Kubiak) are investigated with the help of lax functors. In particular, it is shown that similarities and dissimilarities are interdefinable if \mathsf{Q} is a Girard quantale with a hermitian and cyclic dualizing element.
