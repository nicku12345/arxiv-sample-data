Uniform interpolation properties are defined for equational consequence in a variety of algebras and related to properties of compact congruences on first the free and then the finitely presented algebras of the variety. It is also shown, following related results of Ghilardi and Zawadowski, that a combination of these properties provides a sufficient condition for the first-order theory of the variety to admit a model completion.
