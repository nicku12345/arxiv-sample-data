In this paper we give a complete classification of unitary fusion categories \otimes-generated by an object of dimension \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}. We show that all such categories arise as certain wreath products of either the Fibonacci category, or of the dual even part of the 2D2 subfactor. As a by-product of proving our main classification result we produce a classification of finite unitarizable quotients of \operatorname{Fib}^{*N} satisfying a certain symmetry condition.
