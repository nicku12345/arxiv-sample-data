We give a definition of \mathsf{Q}-net, a generalization of Petri nets based on a Lawvere theory \mathsf{Q}, for which many existing variants of Petri nets are a special case. This definition is functorial with respect to change in Lawvere theory, and we exploit this to explore the relationships between different kinds of \mathsf{Q}-nets. To justify our definition of \mathsf{Q}-net, we construct a family of adjunctions for each Lawvere theory explicating the way in which \mathsf{Q}-nets present free models of \mathsf{Q} in \mathsf{Cat}. This gives a functorial description of the operational semantics for an arbitrary category of \mathsf{Q}-nets. We show how this can be used to construct the semantics for Petri nets, pre-nets, integer nets, and elementary net systems.
