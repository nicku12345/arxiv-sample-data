We extend the notion of compositional associative rewriting as recently studied in the rule algebra framework literature to the setting of rewriting rules with conditions. Our methodology is category-theoretical in nature, where the definition of rule composition operations is encoding the non-deterministic sequential concurrent application of rules in Double-Pushout (DPO) and Sesqui-Pushout (SqPO) rewriting with application conditions based upon \mathcal{M}-adhesive categories. We uncover an intricate interplay between the category-theoretical concepts of conditions on rules and morphisms, the compositionality and compatibility of certain shift and transport constructions for conditions, and thirdly the property of associativity of the composition of rules without conditions.
