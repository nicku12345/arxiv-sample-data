Let C be triangulated category and X a cluster tilting subcategory of C. Koenig and Zhu showed that the quotient category C/X is Gorenstein of Gorenstein dimension at most one. The notion of an extriangulated category was introduced by Nakaoka and Palu as a simultaneous generalization of exact categories and triangulated categories. Now let C be extriangulated category with enough projectives and enough injectives, and X a cluster tilting subcategory of C. In this article, we show that under certain conditions the quotient category C/X is Gorenstein of Gorenstein dimension at most one. As an application, this result generalizes work by Koenig and Zhu.
