Crisp and lattice-valued ambiguous representations of one continuous semilattice in another one are introduced and operation of taking pseudo-inverse of the above relations is defined. It is shown that continuous semilattices and their ambiguous representations, for which taking pseudo-inverse is involutive, form categories. Self-dualities and contravariant equivalences for these categories are obtained. Possible interpretations and applications to processing of imperfect information are discussed.
