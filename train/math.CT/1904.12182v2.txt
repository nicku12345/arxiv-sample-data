There are well known identities that involve the Ext bifunctor, coproducts, and products in Ab4 and Ab4* abelian categories with enough projectives and enough injectives. Namely, for every such category \mathcal{A}, the isomorphisms \operatorname{Ext}^n (\bigoplus_{i\in I}A_{i},X) \cong \prod_{i\in I} \operatorname{Ext}^n(A_{i},X) and \operatorname{Ext}^n (X,\prod_{i\in I}A_{i}) \cong \prod_{i\in I}\operatorname{Ext}^n (X,A_{i}) always exist. The goal of this paper is to show similar isomorphisms for the Yoneda Ext in Ab4 and Ab4* abelian categories with not necessarily enough projectives nor injectives. The desired isomorphisms are constructed explicitely by using limits and colimits.
