In this paper, we study the relationship between wide subcategories and torsion classes of an abelian length category \mathcal{A} from the point of view of lattice theory. Motivated by \tau-tilting reduction of Jasso, we mainly focus on intervals [\mathcal{U},\mathcal{T}] in the lattice \operatorname{\mathsf{tors}} \mathcal{A} of torsion classes in \mathcal{A} such that \mathcal{W}:=\mathcal{U}^\perp \cap \mathcal{T} is a wide subcategory of \mathcal{A}; we call these intervals wide intervals. We prove that a wide interval [\mathcal{U},\mathcal{T}] is isomorphic to the lattice \operatorname{\mathsf{tors}} \mathcal{W} of torsion classes in the abelian category \mathcal{W}. We also characterize wide intervals in two ways: First, in purely lattice theoretic terms based on the brick labeling established by Demonet--Iyama--Reading--Reiten--Thomas; and second, in terms of the Ingalls--Thomas correspondences between torsion classes and wide subcategories, which were further developed by Marks--\v{S}\v{t}ov\'{i}\v{c}ek.
