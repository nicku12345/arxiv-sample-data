Over the past two decades several different approaches to defining a geometry over {\mathbb F}_1 have been proposed. In this paper, relying on To\"en and Vaqui\'e's formalism, we investigate a new category {\mathsf{Sch}}_{\widetilde{\mathsf B}} of schemes admitting a Zariski cover by affine schemes relative to the category of blueprints introduced by Lorscheid. A blueprint, that may be thought of as a pair consisting of a monoid M and a relation on the semiring M \otimes_{{\mathbb F}_1} \mathbb N, is a monoid object in a certain symmetric monoidal category \mathsf B, which is shown to be complete, cocomplete, and closed. We prove that every \widetilde{\mathsf B}-scheme \Sigma can be associated, through adjunctions, with both a classical scheme \Sigma_{\mathbb Z} and a scheme \underline{\Sigma} over {\mathbb F}_1 in the sense of Deitmar, together with a natural transformation \Lambda\colon \Sigma_{\mathbb Z}\to \underline{\Sigma}\otimes_{{\mathbb F}_1} {\mathbb Z}. Furthermore, as an application, we show that the category of "{\mathbb F}_1-schemes" defined by A. Connes and C. Consani can be naturally merged with that of \widetilde{\mathsf B}-schemes to obtain a larger category, whose objects we call "{\mathbb F}_1-schemes with relations".
