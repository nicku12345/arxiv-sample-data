The notion of a higher Segal space was introduced by Dyckerhoff and Kapranov as a general framework for studying higher associativity inherent in a wide range of mathematical objects. In the present work we formalize the connection between this notion and the notion of \mathbb{A}_\infty-algebra. We introduce the notion of a "d-lax \mathbb{A}_\infty-algebra object" which generalizes the notion of an \mathbb{A}_\infty-algebra object. We describe a construction that assigns to a simplicial object S_\bullet in a category \mathscr{S} a datum of higher associators. We show that this datum defines a d-lax \mathbb{A}_\infty-algebra object in the category of correspondences in \mathscr{S} precisely when S_\bullet is a (d+1)-Segal object. More concretely we prove that for n\geq d the "n-dimensional associator" is invertible. The so called "upper" and "lower" d-Segal conditions which originally come from the geometry of polytopes appear naturally in our construction as the two conditions which together imply the invertibility of the d-dimensional associator. A corollary is that for d=2, our construction defines an \mathbb{A}_\infty-algebra in the (\infty,1)-category of correspondences in \mathscr{S} with the 2-Segal conditions implying invertibility of all associativity data.
