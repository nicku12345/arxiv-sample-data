We give a fully constructive proof that there is a proper cartesian \omega-combinatorial model structure on the category of simplicial sets, whose generating cofibrations and trivial cofibrations are the usual boundary inclusion and horn inclusion. The main difference with classical mathematics is that constructively not all monomorphisms are cofibrations (only those satisfying some decidability conditions) and not every object is cofibrant. The proof relies on three main ingredients: First, our construction of a weak model categories on simplicial sets, then the interplay with the semi-simplicial versions of this weak model structure and finally, the use of Kan Ex^{\infty}-functor, and more precisely of S.Moss' direct proof that the natural map X \rightarrow  Ex^{\infty} X is an anodyne morphism, which we show is constructive when X is cofibrant.
