Given a category \mathcal C and a directed partially ordered set J, a certain category pro^J -\mathcal C on inverse systems in \mathcal C is constructed such that the ordinary pro-category pro-\mathcal C is the most special case of a singleton J \equiv \{1\}. Further, the known pro^*-category pro ^*-\mathcal C becomes pro ^{\mathbb N }-\mathcal C. Moreover, given a pro-reflective category pair (\mathcal C, \mathcal D), the J-shape category Sh^J_{(C,\mathcal D)} and the corresponding J-shape functor S^J are constructed which, in mentioned special cases, become the well known ones. Among several important properties, the continuity theorem for a J-shape category is established. It implies the "J-shape theory" is a genuine one such that the shape and the coarse shape theory are its very special examples.
