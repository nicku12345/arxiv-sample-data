In this paper we consider the dg-category of twisted complexes over simplicial spaces. It is clear that a simplicial map f: \mathcal{U}\to \mathcal{V} between simplicial spaces induces a dg-functor f^*: \text{Tw}(\mathcal{V}, \mathcal{R})\to \text{Tw}(\mathcal{U}, \mathcal{R}). In this paper we prove that for simplicial homotopic maps f and g, there exists an A_{\infty}-natural transformation \Phi: f^*\Rightarrow g^* between induced dg-functors. Moreover the 0th component of \Phi is a weak equivalence. If we restrict ourselves to the full dg-subcategory of twisted perfect complexes, we prove that \Phi admits an A_{\infty}-quasi-inverse.
