The notion of associativity (which differs from the straightforward generalization of the usual associativity given by the move of parentheses in the relevant expression) for operations of high arity is introduced. It is proved that the algebraic theory of a variety of universal algebras contains a group operation if and only if it contains a semi-abelian operation which is associative in the sense introduced.
