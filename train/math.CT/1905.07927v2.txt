In this paper, we first construct some complete cotorson pairs on the category \mathbb{C}_N(\mathcal{G}) of unbounded N-complexes of Grothendieck category \mathcal{G}, from two given cotorsion pairs in \mathcal{G}. Next as an application, we focus on particular homotopy categories and the existence of adjoint functors between them. These are an N-complex version of the results were shown by Neeman in the category of ordinary complexes.
