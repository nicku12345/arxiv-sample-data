In this article we generalize the \CP^\infty-construction of dagger monoidal categories to mixed unitary categories. Mixed unitary categories provide a setting, which generalizes (compact) dagger monoidal categories and in which one may study quantum processes of arbitrary (infinite) dimensions.   We show that the existing results for the \CP^\infty-construction hold in this more general setting. In particular, we generalize the notion of environment structures to mixed unitary categories and show that the \CP^\infty-construction on mixed unitary categories is characterized by this generalized environment structure.
