In this paper we present the notion of a von Neumann regular \mathcal{C}^{\infty}-ring, we prove some results about them and we describe some of their properties. We prove, using two different methods, that the category of von Neumann regular \mathcal{C}^{\infty}-rings is a reflective subcategory of \mathcal{C}^{\infty}{\rm \bf Rng}. We prove that every homomorphism between Boolean algebras can be represented by a \mathcal{C}^{\infty}-ring homomorphism between von Neumann regular \mathcal{C}^{\infty}-rings.
