The purpose of this writing is to show that, if we use the definition of elementary \infty-topos that has been proposed by Mike Shulman, then the fact that every geometric \infty-topos satisfies the required axioms, more specifically the last one of them, is actually something close to a large cardinal assumption. Putting it precisely, we will show that, once a Grothendieck universe has been chosen, the fact that every geometric \infty-topos satisfies Shulman's axioms is equivalent to saying that the Grothendieck universe was 1-inaccessible to start with, a condition which is strictly stronger than just being inaccessible. Moreover, a perfectly analogous result can be shown if instead of geometric \infty-toposes our analysis relies on ordinary sheaf toposes. In conclusion, it will be shown that, under stronger assumptions positing the existence of 1-inaccessible cardinals inside the Grothendieck universe, examples of Shulman \infty-toposes which are not geometric can be found.
