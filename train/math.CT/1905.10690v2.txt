We define a natural 2-categorical structure on the base category of a large class of Grothendieck fibrations. Given any model category \mathbf{C}, we construct a fibration whose fibers are the homotopy categories of the slice categories \mathbf{C}/A, and we show that in the case \mathbf{C}=\mathbf{Top}, our construction applied to this fibration recovers the usual 2-category of spaces.
