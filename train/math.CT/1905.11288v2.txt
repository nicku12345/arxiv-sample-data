We compare the colimit and 2-colimit of strict 2-functors in the 2-category of groupoids, over a certain type of posets. These posets are of special importance, as they correspond to coverings of a topological space. The main result of this paper gives conditions on the 2-functor \mathfrak{F}, for which \mathsf{colim}\mathfrak{F}\simeq2\mathsf{colim}\mathfrak{F}. One can easily see that any 2-functor \mathfrak{F} can be deformed to a 2-functor \mathfrak{F}', which satisfied the conditions of the theorem.
