We describe a fully faithful embedding of the category of (reflexive) globular sets into the category of counital cosymmetric R-coalgebras when R is an integral domain. This embedding is a lift of the usual functor of R-chains and the extra structure consists of a derived form of cup coproduct. Additionally, we construct a functor from group-like counital cosymmetric \mbox{R-coalgebras} to \omega-categories and use it to connect two fundamental constructions associated to oriented simplices: Steenrod's cup-i coproducts and Street's orientals. The first defines the square operations in the cohomology of spaces, the second, the nerve of higher-dimensional categories.
