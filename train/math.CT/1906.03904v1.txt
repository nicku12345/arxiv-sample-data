In this paper, we study rewriting modulo a set of algebraic axioms in categories enriched in linear categories, called linear~(2,2)-categories. We introduce the structure of linear~(3,2)-polygraph modulo as a presentation of a linear~(2,2)-category by a rewriting system modulo algebraic axioms. We introduce a symbolic computation method in order to compute linear bases for the vector spaces of 2-cells of these categories. In particular, we study the case of pivotal 2-categories using the isotopy relations given by biadjunctions on 1-cells and cyclicity conditions on 2-cells as axioms for which we rewrite modulo. By this constructive method, we recover the bases of normally ordered dotted oriented Brauer diagrams in te affine oriented Brauer linear~(2,2)-category.
