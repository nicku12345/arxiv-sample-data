Modeling generics in object-oriented programming languages such as Java and C# is a challenge. Recently we proposed a new order-theoretic approach to modeling generics. Given the strong relation between order theory and category theory, in this extended abstract we present how also some tools from category theory, such as adjunctions, monads and operads, are used in our approach to modeling generics.
