In this article we use semigroupoids to describe a notion of algebraic bundles, mostly motivated by Fell (C^*-algebraic) bundles, and the sectional algebras associated to them. As the main motivational example, Steinberg algebras may be regarded as the sectional algebras of trivial (direct product) bundles. Several theorems which relate geometric and algebraic constructions - via the construction of a sectional algebra - are widely generalized: Direct products bundles by semigroupoids correspond to tensor products of algebras; Semidirect products of bundles correspond to "na\"ive" crossed products of algebras; Skew products of graded bundles correspond to smash products of graded algebras; Quotient bundles correspond to quotient algebras. Moreover, most of the results hold in the non-Hausdorff setting. In the course of this work, we generalize the definition of smash products to groupoid graded algebras.   As an application, we prove that whenever \theta is a \land-preaction of a discrete inverse semigroupoid S on an ample (possibly non-Hausdorff) groupoid \mathcal{G}, the Steinberg algebra of the associated groupoid of germs is naturally isomorphic to a crossed product of the Steinberg algebra of \mathcal{G} by S. This is a far-reaching generalization of analogous results which had been proven in particular cases.
