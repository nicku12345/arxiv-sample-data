The concept of a system has proliferated through natural and social sciences. While myriad theories of systems exist, there is no mathematical general theory of systems. In this thesis, we take a first step towards formulating such a theory. Our focus is on developing a syntax for compositional systems equipped with a rewriting theory. We pull from category theory and linguistics to accomplish this. The basic syntactical unit is a structured cospan and rewriting is introduced via the double pushout method. Two versions of rewriting are proposed: one that tracks intermediate steps and another disregards them. Benefits and drawbacks of both versions are discussed. We apply our results to the decomposition of closed systems, obtaining a structurally inductive viewpoint of rewriting such systems.
