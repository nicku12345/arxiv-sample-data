Let \mathcal{K} be a \kappa-accessible category with directed colimits. Assume the Generalized Continuum Hypothesis (GCH) and a proper class of strongly compact cardinals, and suppose that \mathcal{K} is categorical in a high enough cardinal, that is, there is a cardinal \mu for which \mathcal{K} is \mu-accessible such that \mathcal{K} is \lambda-categorical for some \lambda \geq \mu (i.e., it has only one object of internal size \lambda up to isomorphism). We give a necessary and sufficient condition (an interpolation property) so that \mathcal{K} is eventually categorical (i.e., it is \lambda'-categorical for every \lambda' \geq \mu). When considering cardinalities of models of infinitary theories \mathbb{T} of \mathcal{L}_{\theta^+, \theta} that axiomatize \mathcal{K}, and under the same assumptions as before, the result implies the following infinitary version of Morley's categoricity theorem: let S be the class consisting of cardinals \lambda \geq \kappa which are of cofinality at least \theta but are not successors of cardinals of cofinality less than \theta. Then, if \mathbb{T} is \lambda-categorical for some \lambda \geq \mu in S, then it is \lambda'-categorical for every \lambda' \geq \mu in S. We also exhibit an example that shows that this latter formulation is optimal. In the particular case of abstract elementary classes with interpolation we obtain a proof, in ZFC, of Shelah's eventual categoricity conjecture.
