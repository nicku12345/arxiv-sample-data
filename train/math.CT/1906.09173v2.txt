We prove preservation theorems for \mathcal{L}_{\omega_1, G}, the countable fragment of Vaught's closed game logic. These are direct generalizations of the theorems of \L{}o\'s-Tarski (resp. Lyndon) on sentences of \mathcal{L}_{\omega_1, \omega} preserved by substructures (resp. homomorphic images). The solution, in ZFC, only uses general features and can be extended to several variants of other strong first-order logic that do not satisfy the interpolation theorem; instead, the results on infinitary definability are used. This solves an open problem dating back to 1977. Another consequence of our approach is the equivalence of the Vop\v{e}nka principle and a general definability theorem on subsets preserved by homomorphisms.
