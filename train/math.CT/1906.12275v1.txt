The functor between operadic algebras given by restriction along an operad map generally has a left adjoint. We give a necessary and sufficient condition for the restriction functor to admit a right adjoint. The condition is a factorization axiom which roughly says that operations in the codomain operad can be written essentially uniquely as operations in arity one followed by operations in the domain operad.
