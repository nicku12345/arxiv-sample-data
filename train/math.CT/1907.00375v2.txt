Let \mathcal{G} be a Lie groupoid. The category B\mathcal{G} of principal \mathcal{G}-bundles defines a differentiable stack. On the other hand, given a differentiable stack \mathcal{D}, there exists a Lie groupoid \mathcal{H} such that B\mathcal{H} is isomorphic to \mathcal{D}. Define a gerbe over a stack as a morphism of stacks F\colon \mathcal{D}\rightarrow \mathcal{C}, such that F and the diagonal map \Delta_F\colon \mathcal{D}\rightarrow \mathcal{D}\times_{\mathcal{C}}\mathcal{D} are epimorphisms. This paper explores the relationship between a gerbe defined above and a Morita equivalence class of a Lie groupoid extension.
