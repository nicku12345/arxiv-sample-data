For a finite group G, we introduce the complete suboperad Q_G of the categorical G-Barratt-Eccles operad P_G. We prove that P_G is not finitely generated, but Q_G is finitely generated and is a genuine E_\infty G-operad (i.e., it is N_\infty and includes all norms). For G cyclic of order 2 or 3, we determine presentations of the object operad of Q_G and conclude with a discussion of algebras over Q_G, which we call biased permutative equivariant categories.
