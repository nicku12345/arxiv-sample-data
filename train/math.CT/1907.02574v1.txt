We provide a new approach to categorical graph and hypergraph theory by using categorical syntax and semantics. For each monoid M and action on a set X, there is an associated presheaf topos of (X,M)-graphs where each object can be interpreted as a generalized uniform hypergraph where each edge has cardinality \#X incident vertices (including multiplicity) and where the monoid informs what type of cohesivity the edges possess. One distinguishing feature of (X,M)-graphs is the presence of unfixed edges. We prove that unfixed edges are a necessary feature of a category of graphs or uniform hypergraphs if one wants exponentials and effective equivalence relations to exist in the category. The main advantage of separating syntax (the (X,M)-graph theories) from semantics (the categories of (X,M)-graphs) is the ability to interpret the theory in any cocomplete category. This interpetation functor then yields a nerve-realization adjunction and allows us to transfer structure between the category of (X,M)-graphs and the receptive cocomplete category.
