This article is a survey of algebra in the \infty-categorical context, as developed by Lurie in "Higher Algebra", and is a chapter in the "Handbook of Homotopy Theory". We begin by introducing symmetric monoidal stable \infty-categories, such as the derived \infty-category of a commutative ring, before turning to our main example, the \infty-category of spectra. We then go on to consider ring spectra and their \infty-categories of modules, as well as basic constructions such as localization, completion, and dualizability. We conclude with a brief account of the cotangent complex and deformation theory.
