This paper is a coalgebra version of arXiv:1703.04266 and a sequel to arXiv:1607.03066. We present the definition of a pseudo-dualizing complex of bicomodules over a pair of coassociative coalgebras \mathcal C and \mathcal D. For any such complex \mathcal L^\bullet, we construct a triangulated category endowed with a pair of (possibly degenerate) t-structures of the derived type, whose hearts are the abelian categories of left \mathcal C-comodules and left \mathcal D-contramodules. A weak version of pseudo-derived categories arising out of (co)resolving subcategories in abelian/exact categories with enough homotopy adjusted complexes is also considered. Quasi-finiteness conditions for coalgebras, comodules, and contramodules are discussed as a preliminary material.
