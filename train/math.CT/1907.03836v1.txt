We develop the theory of reflective subfibrations on an \infty-topos \mathcal{E}. A reflective subfibration L_\bullet on \mathcal{E} is a pullback-compatible assignment of a reflective subcategory \mathcal{D}_X\subseteq \mathcal{E}{/X}, for every X \in \mathcal{E}. Reflective subfibrations abound in homotopy theory, albeit often disguised, e.g., as stable factorization systems. We prove that L-local maps (i.e., those maps that belong to some \mathcal{D}_X) admit a classifying map, and we introduce the class of L-separated maps, that is, those maps with L-local diagonal. L-separated maps are the local class of maps for a reflective subfibration L'_\bullet on \mathcal{E}. We prove this fact in the compantion paper "L'-localization in an \infty-topos". In this paper, we investigate some interactions between L_\bullet and L'_\bullet and explain when the two reflective subfibrations coincide.
