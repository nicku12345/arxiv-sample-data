In this paper, we study weakly unital dg categories as they were defined by Kontsevich and Soibelman [KS, Sect.4]. We construct a cofibrantly generated Quillen model structure on the category \mathrm{Cat}_{\mathrm{dgwu}}(\Bbbk) of small weakly unital dg categories over a field \Bbbk. Our model structure can be thought of as an extension of the model structure on the category \mathrm{Cat}_{\mathrm{dg}}(\Bbbk) of (strictly unital) small dg categories over \Bbbk, due to Tabuada [Tab]. More precisely, we show that the imbedding of \mathrm{Cat}_{\mathrm{dg}}(\Bbbk) to \mathrm{Cat}_{\mathrm{dgwu}}(\Bbbk) is a right adjoint of a Quillen pair of functors. We prove that this Quillen pair is, in turn, a Quillen equivalence. In course of the proof, we study a non-symmetric dg operad \mathcal{O}, governing the weakly unital dg categories, which is encoded in the Kontsevich-Soibelman definition. We prove that this dg operad is quasi-isomorphic to the operad \mathrm{Assoc}_+ of unital associative algebras.
