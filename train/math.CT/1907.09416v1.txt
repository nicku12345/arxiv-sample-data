In this note we give a self-contained proof of a fundamental statement in the study of cosheaves over a poset. Specifically, if a functor has domain a poset and co-domain a co-complete category, then the left Kan extension of that functor along the embedding of the domain poset into its poset of down-sets is a cosheaf. This proof is meant to replace the mistaken proofs published in the author's thesis and an article on dualities exchanging cellular sheaves and cosheaves.
