The smash product construction (or the Grothendieck construction) takes a functor (or prestack) F \colon B^{op} \to \mathbf{Cat} and returns a fibration p \colon A \to B. In this paper, we develop an analogue of the smash product for prestacks internal to a non-cartesian monoidal category. Our construction simultaneously generalizes the Grothendieck construction for prestacks and smash products for B-module algebras over a bialgebra B. Further, taking fibers or coinvariants allows one to recover the original prestack.
