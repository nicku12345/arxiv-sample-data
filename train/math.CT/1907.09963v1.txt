In this paper, we study a close relationship between relative cluster tilting theory in extriangulated categories and tau-tilting theory in module categories. Our main results show that relative rigid objects are in bijection with \tau-rigid pairs, and also relative maximal rigid objects with support tau-tilting pairs under some assumptions. These results generalize their work by Adachi-Iyama-Reiten, Yang-Zhu and Fu-Geng-Liu. Finally, we introduce mutation of relative maximal rigid objects and show that any basic relative almost maximal rigid object has exactly two non-isomorphic indecomposable complements.
