We study relations between the Serre dimension defined as the growth of entropy of the Serre functor and the global dimension of Bridgeland stability conditions due to Ikeda-Qiu. A fundamental inequality between the Serre dimension and the infimum of the global dimensions is proved. Moreover, we characterize Gepner type stability conditions on fractional Calabi-Yau categories via the Serre dimension, and classify triangulated categories of the Serre dimension lower than one with a Gepner type stability condition.
