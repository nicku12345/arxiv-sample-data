Gene regulatory network (GRN) plays a central role in system biology and genomics. It provides a promising way to model and study complex biological processes. Several computational methods have been developed for the construction and analysis of GRN. In particular, Petri net and its variants were introduced for GRN years ago. On the other hand, Petri net theory itself has been rapidly advanced recently. Especially noteworthy is the combination or treatment of Petri net with the mathematical framework of category theory (categorization), which endows Petri net with the power of abstraction and composability. Open Petri net is a state-of-art implementation of such "categorized" Petri nets. Applying open Petri net to GRN may potentially facilitate the modeling of large scale GRNs. In this manuscript, we took a shallow step towards that direction.
