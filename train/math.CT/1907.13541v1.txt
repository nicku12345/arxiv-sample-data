A notion of n-cotorsion pairs in an extriangulated category with enough projectives and enough injectives is defined in this article. We show that there exists a one-to-one correspondence between n-cotorsion pairs and (n+1)-cluster tilting subcategories. As an application, this result generalizes the work by Huerta, Mendoza and P\'{e}rez in an abelian case. Finally, we give some examples illustrating our main result.
