Let (\mathcal{C},\mathbb{E},\mathfrak{s}) be an extriangulated category with a proper class \xi of \mathbb{E}-triangles. The authors introduced and studied \xi-\mathcal{G}projective and \xi-\mathcal{G}injective in \cite{HZZ}. In this paper, we discuss Gorenstein homological dimensions for extriangulated categories. More precisely, we first give some characterizations of \xi-\mathcal{G}projective dimension by using derived functors on \mathcal{C}. Second, let \mathcal{P}(\xi) (resp. \mathcal{I}(\xi)) be a generating (resp. cogenerating) subcategory of \mathcal{C}. We show that the following equality holds under some assumptions: \sup\{\xi\textrm{-}\mathcal{G}{\rm pd}M \ | \ \textrm{for} \ \textrm{any} \ M\in{\mathcal{C}}\}=\sup\{\xi\textrm{-}\mathcal{G}{\rm id}M \ | \ \textrm{for} \ \textrm{any} \ M\in{\mathcal{C}}\}, where \xi\textrm{-}\mathcal{G}{\rm pd}M (resp. \xi\textrm{-}\mathcal{G}{\rm id}M) denotes \xi-\mathcal{G}projective (resp. \xi-\mathcal{G}injective) dimension of M. As an application, our main results generalize their work by Bennis-Mahdou and Ren-Liu. Moreover, our proof is not far from the usual module or triangulated case.
