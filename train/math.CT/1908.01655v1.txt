Noncommutative near-group fusion categories were completely classified in the previous work of the first named author by using an operator algebraic method (and hence under the assumption of unitarity), and they were shown to be group theoretical though the corresponding pointed categories were not identified. In this note we give a purely algebraic construction of the noncommutative near-group fusion categories starting from pointed categories categorically Morita equivalent to them.
