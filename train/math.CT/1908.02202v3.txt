Lenses have a rich history and have recently received a great deal of attention from applied category theorists. We generalize the notion of lens by defining a category \mathsf{Lens}_F for any category \mathcal{C} and functor F\colon \mathcal{C}^{\rm op}\to\mathsf{Cat}, using a variant of the Grothendieck construction. All of the mathematics in this note is straightforward; the purpose is simply to see lenses in a broader context where some closely-related examples, such as ringed spaces and open continuous dynamical systems, can be included.
