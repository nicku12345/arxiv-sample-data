We prove that every open \sigma-locally Polish groupoid G is Borel equivalent to the groupoid of models on the Urysohn sphere \mathbb{U} of an \mathcal{L}_{\omega_1\omega}-sentence in continuous logic. In particular, the orbit equivalence relations of such groupoids are up to Borel bireducibility precisely those of Polish group actions, answering a question of Lupini. Analogously, every non-Archimedean (i.e., every unit morphism has a neighborhood basis of open subgroupoids) open quasi-Polish groupoid is Borel equivalent to the groupoid of models on \mathbb{N} of an \mathcal{L}_{\omega_1\omega}-sentence in discrete logic.   The proof in fact gives a topological representation of G as the groupoid of isomorphisms between a "continuously varying" family of structures over the space of objects of G, constructed via a topological Yoneda-like lemma of Moerdijk for localic groupoids and its metric analog. Other ingredients in our proof include the Lopez-Escobar theorem for continuous logic, a uniformization result for full Borel functors between open quasi-Polish groupoids, a uniform Borel version of Kat\v{e}tov's construction of \mathbb{U}, groupoid versions of the Pettis and Birkhoff--Kakutani theorems, and a development of the theory of non-Hausdorff topometric spaces and their quotients.
