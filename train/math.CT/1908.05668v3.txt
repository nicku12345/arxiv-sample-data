The main objective of this paper is to construct a symmetric monoidal closed model category of coherently commutative monoidal quasi-categories. We construct another model category structure whose fibrant objects are (essentially) those coCartesian fibrations which represent objects that are known as symmetric monoidal quasi-categories in the literature. We go on to establish a Quillen equivalence between the two model categories.
