The deformation cohomology of a tensor category controls deformations of its monoidal structure. Here we describe the deformation cohomology of tensor categories generated by one object (the so-called Schur-Weyl categories). Using this description we compute the deformation cohomology of free symmetric tensor categories generated by one object with an algebra of endomorphism free of zero-divisors. We compare the answers with the exterior invariants of the general linear Lie algebra.
