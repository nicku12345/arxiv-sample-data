Regular logic is the fragment of first order logic generated by =, \top, \wedge, and \exists. A key feature of this logic is that it is the minimal fragment required to express composition of binary relations; another is that it is the internal logic of regular categories. The link between these two facts is that in any regular category, one may construct a notion of binary relation using jointly-monic spans; this results in what is known as the bicategory of relations of the regular category. In this paper we provide a direct axiomatization of bicategories of relations, which we term relational po-categories, reinterpreting the earlier work of Carboni and Walters along these lines. Our main contribution is an explicit proof that the 2-category of regular categories is equivalent to that of relational po-categories. Throughout, we emphasize the graphical nature of relational po-categories.
