We study right exact tensor products on the category of finitely presented functors. As our main technical tool, we use a multilinear version of the universal property of so-called Freyd categories. Furthermore, we compare our constructions with the Day convolution of arbitrary functors. Our results are stated in a constructive way and give a unified approach for the implementation of tensor products in various contexts.
