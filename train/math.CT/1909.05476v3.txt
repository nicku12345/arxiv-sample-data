We define the secondary Hochschild complex for an entwining structure over a commutative k-algebra B. We show that this complex carries the structure of a weak comp algebra. We obtain two distinct cup product structures and a Hodge type decomposition for the secondary cohomology groups. We also consider a subcomplex on which the two cup products coincide and which satisfies the axioms for being a comp algebra. The cohomology of this subcomplex then forms a Gerstenhaber algebra. We also construct a bicomplex that controls the deformations of the entwining structure over B.
