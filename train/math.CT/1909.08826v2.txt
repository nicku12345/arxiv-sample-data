Let \mathsf{PreOrd}(\mathbb C) be the category of internal preorders in an exact category \mathbb C. We show that the pair (\mathsf{Eq}(\mathbb C), \mathsf{ParOrd}(\mathbb C)) is a pretorsion theory in \mathsf{PreOrd}(\mathbb C), where \mathsf{Eq}(\mathbb C) and \mathsf{ParOrd}(\mathbb C)) are the full subcategories of internal equivalence relations and of internal partial orders in \mathbb C, respectively. We observe that \mathsf{ParOrd}(\mathbb C) is a reflective subcategory of \mathsf{PreOrd}(\mathbb C) such that each component of the unit of the adjunction is a pullback-stable regular epimorphism. The reflector F:\mathsf{PreOrd}(\mathbb C)\to \mathsf{ParOrd}(\mathbb C) turns out to have stable units in the sense of Cassidy, H\'ebert and Kelly, thus inducing an admissible categorical Galois structure. In particular, when \mathbb C is the category \mathsf{Set} of sets, we show that this reflection induces a monotone-light factorization system (in the sense of Carboni, Janelidze, Kelly and Par\'e) in \mathsf{PreOrd}(\mathsf{Set}). A topological interpretation of our results in the category of Alexandroff-discrete spaces is also given, via the well-known isomorphism between this latter category and \mathsf{PreOrd}(\mathsf{Set}).
