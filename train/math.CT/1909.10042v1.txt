Using the description of enriched \infty-operads as associative algebras in symmetric sequences, we define algebras for enriched \infty-operads as certain modules in symmetric sequences. For \mathbf{V} a nice symmetric monoidal model category, we prove that strict algebras for \Sigma-cofibrant operads in \mathbf{V} are equivalent to algebras in the associated symmetric monoidal \infty-category in this sense. We also show that \mathcal{O}-algebras in \mathcal{V} can equivalently be described as morphisms of \infty-operads from \mathcal{O} to endomorphism operads of (families of) objects of \mathcal{V}.
