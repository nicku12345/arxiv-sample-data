We focus on two factorization systems for opfibrations in the 2-category Fib(B) of fibrations over a fixed base category B. The first one is the internal version of the so called comprehensive factorization, where the right orthogonal class is given by internal discrete opfibrations. The second one has as its right orthogonal class internal opfibrations in groupoids, i.e. with groupoidal fibres. These factorizations can be obtained by means of a single step 2-colimit. Namely, their left orthogonal parts are nothing but suitable coidentifiers and coinverters respectively. We will show how these results follow from their analogues in Cat. To this end, we first provide suitable conditions on a 2-category C, allowing the transfer of the construction of coinverters and coidentifiers from C to Fib(B).
