We introduce the concept of fuzzy sheaf as a natural generalisation of a sheaf over a topological space in the context of fuzzy topologies. Then we prove a representation for a class of MV-algebras in which the representing object is an MV-sheaf of lattice-ordered Abelian groups, namely, a fuzzy sheaf in which the base (fuzzy) topological space is an MV-topological space and the stalks are Abelian \ell-groups.
