We show that there is an equivalence in any n-topos \mathcal{X} between the pointed and k-connective objects of \mathcal{X} and the \mathbb{E}_k-group objects of \mathcal{X}. We also show that for any pointed and k-connective object X of \mathcal{X} there is an equivalence between the \infty-category of modules in \mathcal{X} over the associative algebra \Omega^k X, and the \infty-category of comodules in \mathcal{X} for the cocommutative coalgebra \Omega^{k-1}X. In doing so, we prove several results which may be of broader interest: we show that Lurie's straightening-unstraightening equivalence holds over an (n-1)-groupoid in any n-topos for 0\leq n\leq\infty; we show that taking categories of \mathcal{O}-algebras, for \mathcal{O} an \infty-operad, commutes with truncation; and we show that for a pointed and connected (n-1)-groupoid Y there is an equivalence between \Omega Y-modules in \mathcal{X} and \mathcal{X}-valued presheaves on Y.
