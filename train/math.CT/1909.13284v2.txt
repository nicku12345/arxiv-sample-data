Herschend-Liu-Nakaoka introduced the notion of n-exangulated categories as higher dimensional analogues of extriangulated categories defined by Nakaoka-Palu. The class of n-exangulated categories contains n-exact categories and (n+2)-angulated categories as examples. In this article, we introduce a notion of Frobenius n-exangulated categories which are a generalization of Frobenius n-exact categories. We show that the stable category of a Frobenius n-exangulated category is an (n+2)-angulated category. As an application, this result generalizes the work by Jasso. We provide a class of n-exangulated categories which are neither n-exact categories nor (n+2)-angulated categories. Finally, we discuss an application of the main results and give some examples illustrating it.
