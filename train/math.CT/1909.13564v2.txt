We prove that the folk model category structure on the category of strict \omega-categories, introduced by Lafont, M\'etayer and Worytkiewicz, is monoidal, first, for the Gray tensor product and, second, for the join of \omega-categories, introduced by the first author and Maltsiniotis. We moreover show that the Gray tensor product induces, by adjunction, a tensor product of strict (m,n)-categories and that this tensor product is also compatible with the folk model category structure. In particular, we get a monoidal model category structure on the category of strict \omega-groupoids. We prove that this monoidal model category structure satisfies the monoid axiom, so that the category of Gray monoids, studied by the second author, bears a natural model category structure.
