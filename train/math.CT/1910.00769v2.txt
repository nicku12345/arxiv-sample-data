We work with FI-modules over a small preadditive category \mathcal R, viewed as a ring with several objects. Our aim is to study torsion theories for FI-modules. We are especially interested in torsion theories on finitely generated FI-modules and the category of what we call "shift finitely generated" FI-modules. We also apply these methods to study inductive descriptions of FI-modules over \mathcal R.
