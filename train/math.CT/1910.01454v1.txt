Let \cal C be an (d+2)-angulated category with an d-suspension functor \Sigma^d. Our main results show that every Serre functor on \cal C is an (d+2)-angulated functor. We also show that \cal C has a Serre functor \mathbb{S} if and only if \cal C has Auslander-Reiten (d+2)-angles. Moreover, \tau_d=\mathbb{S}\Sigma^{-d} where \tau_d is d-Auslander-Reiten translation. These results generalize the works by Bondal-Kapranov and Reiten-Van den Bergh. In addition, we prove that for a strongly functorially finite subcategory \cal X of \cal C, the quotient category \cal C/\cal X is an (d+2)-angulated category if and only if (\cal C,\cal C) is an \cal X-mutation pair, and if and only if \tau_d\cal X =\cal X. This generalizes a result by J{\o}rgensen who proved the equivalence between the first and the third conditions for triangulated categories.
