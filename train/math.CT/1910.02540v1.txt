In this paper we introduce a description of ordered groupoids as a particular type of double categories. This enables us to turn Lawson's correspondence between ordered groupoids and left-cancellative categories into a biequivalence. We use this to identify which ordered functors are maps of sites in the sense that they give rise to geometric morphisms between the induced sheaf categories, and establish a Comparison Lemma for maps between Ehresmann sites.
