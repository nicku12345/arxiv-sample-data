We present a construction of stable diagonal factorizations, used to define categorical models of type theory with identity types, from a family of algebraic weak factorization systems on the slices of a category. Inspired by a computational interpretation of indexed inductive types in cubical type theory due to Cavallo and Harper, it can be read as a refactoring of a construction of van den Berg and Garner, and is a new alternative among a variety of approaches to modeling identity types in the literature.
