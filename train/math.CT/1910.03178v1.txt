For a braided fusion category \mathcal{V}, a \mathcal{V}-fusion category is a fusion category \mathcal{C} equipped with a braided monoidal functor \mathcal{F}:\mathcal{V} \to Z(\mathcal{C}). Given a fixed \mathcal{V}-fusion category (\mathcal{C}, \mathcal{F}) and a fixed G-graded extension \mathcal{C}\subseteq \mathcal{D} as an ordinary fusion category, we characterize the enrichments \widetilde{\mathcal{F}}:\mathcal{V} \to Z(\mathcal{D}) of \mathcal{D} which are compatible with the enrichment of \mathcal{C}. We show that G-crossed extensions of a braided fusion category \mathcal{C} are G-extensions of the canonical enrichment of \mathcal{C} over itself. As an application, we parameterize the set of G-crossed braidings on a fixed G-graded fusion category in terms of certain subcategories of its center, extending Nikshych's classification of the braidings on a fusion category.
