To the best of our knowledge, there are very few results on how Heyting-valued models are affected by the morphisms on the complete Heyting algebras that determine them: the only cases found in the literature are concerning automorphisms of complete Boolean algebras and complete embedding between them (\emph{i.e}., injective Boolean algebra homomorphisms that preserves arbitrary suprema and arbitrary infima). In the present work, we consider and explore how more general kinds of morphisms between complete Heyting algebras \mathbb{H} and \mathbb{H}' induce arrows between V^{(\mathbb{H})} and V^{(\mathbb{H}')}, and between their corresponding localic toposes \mathbf{Set}^{(\mathbb{H})} (\simeq \mathbf{Sh}(\mathbb{H})) and \mathbf{Set}^{(\mathbb{H}')} (\simeq \mathbf{Sh}(\mathbb{H}')). In more details: any {\em geometric morphism} f^* : \mathbf{Set}^{(\mathbb{H})} \to \mathbf{Set}^{(\mathbb{H'})}, (that automatically came from a unique locale morphism f : \mathbb{H} \to \mathbb{H}'), can be "lifted" to an arrow \tilde{f} : V^{(\mathbb{H})} \to V^{(\mathbb{H}')}. We also provide also some semantic preservation results concerning this arrow \tilde{f} : V^{(\mathbb{H})} \to V^{(\mathbb{H}')}.
