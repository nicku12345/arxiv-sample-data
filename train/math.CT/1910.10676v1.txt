This paper extends the result from Amnon Neeman regarding strong generators in Dperf(X), from X being a quasicompact, separated scheme to X being quasicompact, quasiseparated scheme that admits a separator. Neeman's result states a necessary and sufficient condition for Dperf(X) being regular. Together with being proper over a noetherian commutative ring, those conditions give an interesting description for when an R-linear functor H is representable.
