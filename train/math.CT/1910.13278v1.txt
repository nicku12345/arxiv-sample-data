Let R be an artin ring and \Theta=\{\Theta(1),\Theta(2),\cdots,\Theta(n)\} be a family of objects in an artin extriangulated R-category (\cal C,\mathbb{E},\mathfrak{s}) such that \mathbb{E}(\Theta(j),\Theta(i))=0 for all j\geq i. In this paper, we show that the class \cal P(\Theta) of the \Theta-projective objects is a precovering class and the class \cal I(\Theta) of the \Theta-injective objects is a preenveloping one in \cal C. Furthermore, if \cal C has enough projectives and enough injectives, we show that the subcategory \cal F(\Theta) of \Theta-filtered objects is functorially finite in \cal C. As an appliacation, this generalizes the works by Ringel in a module category case and Mendoza-Santiago in a triangulated category case.
