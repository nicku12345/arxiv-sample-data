We introduce, for a symmetric fusion category \mathcal{A} with Drinfeld centre \mathcal{Z}(\mathcal{A}), the notion of \mathcal{Z}(\mathcal{A})-crossed braided tensor category. These are categories that are enriched over \mathcal{Z}(\mathcal{A}) equipped with a symmetric tensor product, while being braided monoidal with respect to the usual tensor product on \mathcal{Z}(\mathcal{A}).   In the Tannakian case where \mathcal{A}=\mathbf{Rep}(G) for a finite group G, the 2-category of \mathcal{Z}(\mathcal{A})-crossed braided categories is shown to be equivalent to the 2-category of G-crossed braided tensor categories. A similar result is established for the super-Tannakian case where \mathcal{A} is the representation category of a finite super-group.
