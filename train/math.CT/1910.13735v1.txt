We introduce the notion of star-symmetry for relations in a multi-pointed category and use it to obtain a characterization of the projective covers of 2-star-permutable categories. This generalizes the results of Rosick\'y-Vitale for regular Mal'tsev categories, as well as those of Gran-Rodelo for regular subtractive categories. We apply the characterization in terms of star-symmetry to recover the syntactic conditions defining E-subtractive varieties in the sense of Ursini.
