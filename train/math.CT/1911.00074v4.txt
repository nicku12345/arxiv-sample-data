The second author and Katzarkov introduced categorical invariants based on counting of full triangulated subcategories in a given triangulated category \mathcal T and they demonstrated different choices of additional properties of the subcategories being counted, in particular - an approach to make non-commutative counting in \mathcal T dependable on a stability condition \sigma \in {\rm Stab}(\mathcal T). In this paper, we focus on this approach. After recalling the definitions of a \textit{stable non-commutative curve in \mathcal T} and related notions, we prove a few general facts, and study fairly completely an example: \mathcal T = D^b(Q), where Q is the acyclic triangular quiver. In previous papers was shown that there are two non-commutative curves of non-commutative genus 1 and infinitely many non-commutative curves of non-commutative genus 0 in D^b(Q). Our studies here imply that for an open and dense subset in {\rm Stab}(D^b(Q)) the stable non-commutative curves in D^b(Q) are finite. Counting such curves as \sigma varies in {\rm Stab}(D^b(Q)) and for genus 0 produces all the even non-negative integers, 1, and +\infty, whereas for genus 1 it produces the integers 0,1,2. Counting semi-stable derived points (explained in the paper) produces \{3,4,5,+\infty\}, and the subset of {\rm Stab}(D^b(Q)) with finitely many such points is open but not dense.
