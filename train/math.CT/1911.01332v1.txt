In this paper we show that every object in the dg-category of relative singularities Sing(B,\underline{f}) associated to a pair (B,\underline{f}), where B is a ring and \underline{f}\in B^n, is equivalent to a retract of a K(B,\underline{f})-dg module concentrated in n+1 degrees. When n=1, we show that Orlov's comparison theorem, which relates the dg-category of relative singularities and that of matrix factorizations of an LG-model, holds true without any regularity assumption on the potential.
