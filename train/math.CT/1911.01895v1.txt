We prove a correspondence between \kappa-small fibrations in simplicial presheaf categories equipped with the injective or projective model structure (and left Bousfield localizations thereof) and relative \kappa-compact maps in their underlying quasi-categories for suitably large inaccessible cardinals \kappa. We thus obtain a transition result between weakly universal small fibrations in the injective Dugger-Rezk-style standard presentations of model toposes and object classifiers in Grothendieck \infty-toposes in the sense of Lurie.
