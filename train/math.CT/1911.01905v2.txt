The goal of this paper is to provide the last equivalence needed in order to identify all known models for (\infty,2)-categories. We do this by showing that Verity's model of saturated 2-trivial complicial sets is equivalent to Lurie's model of \infty-bicategories, which, in turn, has been shown to be equivalent to all other known models for (\infty,2)-categories. A key technical input is given by identifying the notion of \infty-bicategories with that of weak \infty-bicategories, a step which allows us to understand Lurie's model structure in terms of Cisinski--Olschok's theory. This description of \infty-bicategories, which may be of independent interest, is proved using tools coming from a new theory of outer (co)cartesian fibrations, further developed in a companion paper. In the last part of the paper we construct a homotopically fully faithful scaled simplicial nerve functor for 2-categories, we give two equivalent descriptions of it, and we show that the homotopy 2-category of an \infty-bicategory retains enough information to detect thin 2-simplices.
