This paper constructs an h-model structure for diagrams of streams, locally preordered spaces. Along the way, the paper extends some classical characterizations of Hurewicz fibrations and closed Hurewicz cofibrations. The usual characterization of classical closed Hurewicz cofibrations as inclusions of neighborhood deformation retracts extends. A characterization of classical Hurewicz fibrations as algebras over a pointed Moore cocylinder endofunctor also extends. An immediate consequence is a long exact sequence for directed homotopy monoids, with applications to safety verifications for database protocols.
