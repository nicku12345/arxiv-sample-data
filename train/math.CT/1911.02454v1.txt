Segal spaces are simplicial spaces with a higher categorical compositional structure, and ever since their associated model structure has been introduced by Charles Rezk, complete Segal spaces have become one of the standard models for (\infty,1)-category theory. This paper is a study of Segal spaces with invertible arrows, first considered as fibrant objects in a model structure by Julie Bergner under the name of Bousfield-Segal spaces. We show that Bergner's model structure is a left Bousfield localization of Rezk's model structure for Segal spaces, and note that complete Bousfield-Segal spaces in fact have been studied under various different names in the literature. It follows that complete Bousfield-Segal spaces indeed yield a model for both \infty-groupoids and Homotopy Type Theory.
