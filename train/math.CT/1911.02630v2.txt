A split extension of monoids with kernel k \colon N \to G, cokernel e \colon G \to H and splitting s \colon H \to G is Schreier if there exists a unique set-theoretic map q \colon G \to N such that for all g \in G, g = kq(g) \cdot se(g). Schreier extensions have a complete characterization and have been shown to correspond to monoid actions of H on N. If the uniqueness requirement of q is relaxed, the resulting split extension is called weakly Schreier. A natural example of these is the Artin glueings of frames. In this paper we provide a complete characterization of the weakly Schreier extensions of H by N, proving them to be equivalent to certain quotients of N \times H paired with a function that behaves like an action with respect to the quotient. Furthermore, we demonstrate the failure of the split short lemma in this setting and provide a full characterization of the morphisms that occur between weakly Schreier extensions. Finally, we use the characterization to construct some classes of examples of weakly Schreier extensions.
