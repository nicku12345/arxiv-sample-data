We characterize the modules of infinite projective dimension over the endomorphism algebras of Opperman-Thomas cluster tilting objects X in (n+2)-angulated categories (\mathcal C,\Sigma^n,\Theta). For an indecomposable object M of \mathcal C, we define in this article the ideal I_M of {\rm End}_{\mathcal C}(\Sigma^nX) given by all endomorphisms that factor through {\rm add} M, and show that the {\rm End}_{\mathcal C}(X)-module {\rm Hom}_{\mathcal C}(X,M) has infinite projective dimension precisely when I_M is non-zero. As an application, we generalize a recent result by Beaudet-Br\"{u}stle-Todorov for cluster-tilted algebras.
