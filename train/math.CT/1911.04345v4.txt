Let f:G\to \mathrm{Pic}(R) be a map of E_\infty-groups, where \mathrm{Pic}(R) denotes the Picard space of an E_\infty-ring spectrum R. We determine the tensor X\otimes_R Mf of the Thom E_\infty-R-algebra Mf with a space X; when X is the circle, the tensor with X is topological Hochschild homology over R. We use the theory of localizations of \infty-categories as a technical tool: we contribute to this theory an \infty-categorical analogue of Day's reflection theorem about closed symmetric monoidal structures on localizations, and we prove that for a smashing localization L of the \infty-category of presentable \infty-categories, the free L-local presentable \infty-category on a small simplicial set K is given by presheaves on K valued on the L-localization of the \infty-category of spaces.   If X is a pointed space, a map g: A\to B of E_\infty-ring spectra satisfies X-base change if X\otimes B is the pushout of A\to X\otimes A along g. Building on a result of Mathew, we prove that if g is \'etale then it satisfies X-base change provided X is connected. We also prove that g satisfies X-base change provided the multiplication map of B is an equivalence. Finally, we prove that, under some hypotheses, the Thom isomorphism of Mahowald cannot be an instance of S^0-base change.
