One goal of applied category theory is to better understand networks appearing throughout science and engineering. Here we introduce "structured cospans" as a way to study networks with inputs and outputs. Given a functor L \colon \mathsf{A} \to \mathsf{X}, a structured cospan is a diagram in \mathsf{X} of the form L(a) \rightarrow x \leftarrow L(b). If \mathsf{A} and \mathsf{X} have finite colimits and L is a left adjoint, we obtain a symmetric monoidal category whose objects are those of \mathsf{A} and whose morphisms are isomorphism classes of structured cospans. This is a hypergraph category. However, it arises from a more fundamental structure: a symmetric monoidal double category where the horizontal 1-cells are structured cospans. We show how structured cospans solve certain problems in the closely related formalism of "decorated cospans", and explain how they work in some examples: electrical circuits, Petri nets, and chemical reaction networks.
