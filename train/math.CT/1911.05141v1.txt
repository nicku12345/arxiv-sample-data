Elmendorf's Theorem states that the category of continuous actions of a topological group is a Grothendieck topos in the sense that it is equivalent to a category of sheaves on a site. This paper offers a 2-dimensional generalization by showing that a certain 2-category of continuous actions of a topological 2-group is 2-equivalent to a 2-category of 2-sheaves on a suitable 2-site.
