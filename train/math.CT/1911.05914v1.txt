Compact symmetric multicategories (CSMs) generalise a number of operad-like devices, such as wheeled properads and modular operads, that admit a contraction operation as well as an operadic multiplication. They were introduced in 2011 by Joyal and Kock, who constructed them as the algebras for an endofunctor on a certain presheaf category. CSMs are known to exhibit strange behaviour, related to the contraction of units, that presents some difficulty for describing their combinatorics, and hence for proving a nerve theorem. Here, non-unital CSMs are constructed as algebras for a monad defined in terms of connected graphs, and this provides the foundation for a new construction of CSMs based on a distributive law. This enables a proof, in the style of Joyal and Kock, of a corresponding nerve theorem characterising CSMs in terms of a Segal condition.
