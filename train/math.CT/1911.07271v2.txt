Let \mathcal{C} be a spherical fusion category. The goal of this article is to present the tube category of \mathcal{C}, denoted \mathcal{TC}, as giving an alternative graphical perspective on the Drinfeld centre of \mathcal{C}, denoted Z(\mathcal{C}). We then exploit this perspective to obtain an alternative proof of the equivalence between Z(\mathcal{C}) and \mathcal{C} \boxtimes \bar{\mathcal{C}} when \mathcal{C} is modular. Sections 2-4 provide a survey of the required prerequisites; readers already familiar with graphical calculus in fusion categories should start at Section 5.
