This paper contains a detailed exposition of the nonhomogeneous Koszul duality theory in the relative situation over a noncentral, noncommutative, nonsemisimple base ring, as announced in Section 0.4 of arXiv:0708.3398. We prove the Poincare-Birkhoff-Witt theorem in this context and construct the triangulated equivalences of derived Koszul duality. The duality between the ring of differential operators and the de Rham DG-algebra, with the ring of functions as the base ring, is the thematic example. The moderate generality level makes the exposition in this paper more accessible than the very heavily technical Chapter 11 of arXiv:0708.3398.
