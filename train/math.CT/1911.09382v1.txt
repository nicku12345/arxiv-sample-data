The theory of bounded, distributive lattices provides the appropriate language for describing directionality and asymptotics in dynamical systems. For bounded, distributive lattices the general notion of `set-difference' taking values in a semilattice is introduced, and is called the Conley form. The Conley form is used to build concrete, set-theoretical models of spectral, or Priestley spaces, of bounded, distributive lattices and their finite coarsenings. Such representations build order-theoretic models of dynamical systems, which are used to develop tools for computing global characteristics of a dynamical system.
