We develop a new framework to study real K-theory in the context of \infty-categories. For this, we introduce Waldhausen \infty-categories with genuine duality, which will be the input for such K-theory. These are Waldhausen \infty-categories in the sense of Barwick equipped with a compatible duality and a refinement of their (lax) hermitian objects generalizing the concept of Poincar\'e \infty-categories of Lurie. They may also be thought of as a version of complete Segal spaces enriched in genuine C_2-spaces whose underlying \infty-category carries a compatible Waldhausen structure, since we show that their respective \infty-categories are equivalent.   We define the real K-theory genuine C_2-spaces by means of an enriched version of the S_\bullet-construction, defined for Waldhausen \infty-categories with genuine duality. Moreover, we prove an Additivity Theorem for this S_\bullet-construction which leads to an Additivity Theorem for real K-theory. Furthermore, such real K-theory satisfy a universal property -- analogous to that proved by Barwick for algebraic K-theory of Waldhausen \infty-categories --: We prove that every theory can be universally turned into an additive theory and identify our real K-theory with the universal additive theory associated to the functor that associates to a Waldhausen \infty-category with genuine duality its maximal subspace.   Finally, we promote the real K-theory genuine C_2-spaces to genuine C_2-spectra.
