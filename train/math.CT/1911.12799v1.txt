The category \mathbf{XSq} of crossed squares is equivalent to the category \mathbf{Cat2} of cat^2-groups. Functions for computing with these structures have been developed in the package \mathsf{XMod} written using the \mathsf{GAP} computational discrete algebra programming language. This paper includes details of the algorithms used. It contains tables listing the 1,000 isomorphism classes of cat^2-groups on groups of order at most 30.
