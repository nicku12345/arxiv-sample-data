Delta lenses are an established mathematical framework for modelling and designing bidirectional model transformations. Following the recent observations by Fong et al, the paper extends the delta lens framework with a a new ingredient: learning over a parameterized space of model transformations seen as functors. We define a notion of an asymmetric learning delta lens with amendment (ala-lens), and show how ala-lens can be organized into a symmetric monoidal (sm) category. We also show that sequential and parallel composition of well-behaved ala-lenses are also well-behaved so that well-behaved ala-lenses constitute a full sm-subcategory of ala-lenses.
