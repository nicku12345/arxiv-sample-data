Let {\cal E} be a topos, {{\rm Dec}({\cal E}) \rightarrow {\cal E}} be the full subcategory of decidable objects, and {{\cal E}_{\neg\neg} \rightarrow {\cal E}} be the full subcategory of double-negation sheaves. We give sufficient conditions for the existence of a Unity and Identity {{\cal E} \rightarrow {\cal S}} for the two subcategories of E above, making them Adjointly Opposite. Typical examples of such {\cal E} include many `gros' toposes in Algebraic Geometry, simplicial sets and other toposes of `combinatorial' spaces in Algebraic Topology, and certain models of Synthetic Differential Geometry.
