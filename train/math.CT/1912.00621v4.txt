The aim of the paper is to discuss the relation subgroups of the Grothendieck groups of extriangulated categories and certain other subgroups. It is shown that a locally finite extriangulated category \C has Auslander-Reiten \E-triangles and the relations of the Grothendieck group K_{0}(\C) are generated by the Auslander-Rieten \E-triangles. A partial converse result is given when restricting to the triangulated categories with a cluster tilting subcategory: in the triangulated category \C with a cluster tilting subcategory, the relations of the Grothendieck group K_0(\C) are generated by Auslander-Reiten triangles if and only if the triangulated category \C is locally finite. It is also shown that there is a one-to-one correspondence between subgroups of K_{0}(\C) containing the image of \mathcal G and dense \mathcal G-(co)resolving subcategories of \C where \mathcal G is a generator of \C, which generalizes results about classifying subcategories of a triangulated \cite{t} or an exact category \C \cite{m} by subgroups of K_{0}(\C).
