Assume that (\mathcal{C}, \mathbb{E}, \mathfrak{s}) is an extriangulated category satisfying Condition (WIC). Let (\cal Q, \widetilde{\cal R}) and (\widetilde{\cal Q}, \cal R) be two hereditary cotorsion pairs satisfying conditions \widetilde{\cal R} \subseteq \cal R, \widetilde{\cal Q}\subseteq \cal Q and \widetilde{\cal Q}\cap \cal R = \cal Q \cap \widetilde{\cal R}. Then there exists a unique thick class \cal W for which (\cal Q,\cal W,\cal R) is a Hovey triple. As an application, this result generalizes the work by Gillespie in an exact case. Moreover, it highlights new phenomena when it applied to triangulated categories.
