Let U be a silting object in a derived category over a dg-algebra A, and let B be the endomorphism dg-algebra of U. Under some appropriate hypotheses, we show that if U is good, then there exist a dg-algebra C, a homological epimorphism B\rightarrow C and a recollement among the (unbounded) derived categories \mathbf{D}(C,d) of C, \mathbf{D}(B,d) of B and \mathbf{D}(A,d) of A. In particular, the kernel of the left derived functor -\otimes^{\mathbb{L}}_{B}U is triangle equivalent to the derived category \mathbf{D}(C,d). Conversely, if -\otimes^{\mathbb{L}}_{B}U admits a fully faithful left adjoint functor, then U is good. Moreover, we establish a criterion for the existence of a recollement of the derived category of a dg-algebra relative to two derived categories of weak non-positive dg-algebras. Finally, some applications are given related to good cosilting objects, good 2-term silting complexes, good tilting complexes and modules, which recovers a recent result by Chen and Xi.
