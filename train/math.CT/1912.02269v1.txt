This paper introduces a computational approach to classifying low rank modular categories up to their modular data. The modular data of a modular category is a pair of matrices, (S,T). Virtually all the numerical information of the category is contained within or derived from the modular data. The modular data satisfy a variety of criteria that Bruillard, Ng, Rowell, and Wang call the admissibility criteria. Of note is the Galois group of the S matrix is an abelian group that acts faithfully on the columns of the eigenvalue matrix, s = (\frac{S_{ij}}{S_{0j}}). This gives an injection from Gal(\mathbb{Q}(S),\mathbb{Q}) \to  Sym_r, where r is the rank of the category. Our approach begins by listing all the possible abelian subgroups of Sym_6 and building all the possible modular data for each group. We run each set of modular data through a series of Gr\"obner basis calculations until we either find a contradiction or solve for the modular data.
