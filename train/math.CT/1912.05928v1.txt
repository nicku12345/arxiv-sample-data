This paper is devoted to constructing some recollements of additive categories associated to concentric twin cotorsion pairs on an extriangulated category. As an application, this result generalizes the work by Chen-Liu-Yang in a triangulated case. Moreover, it highlights new phenomena when it applied to an exact category. Finally, we give some applications to illustrate our main results. In particular, we obtain the Krause's recollement whose the proofs are both elementary and very general.
