We introduce idris-ct, a Idris library providing verified type definitions of categorical concepts.idris-ct strives to be a bridge between academy and industry, catering both to category theorists who want to implement and try their ideas in a practical environment and to businesses and engineers who care about formalization with category theory: It is inspired by similar libraries developed for theorem proving but remains very practical, being aimed at software production in business. Nevertheless, the use of dependent types allows for a formally correct implementation of categorical concepts, so that guarantees can be made on software properties.
