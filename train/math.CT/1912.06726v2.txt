We construct a category of fibrant objects \mathbb{C}\langle P\rangle in the sense of Brown from any regular hyperdoctrine P : \mathbb{C}^{\mathsf{op}}\to\mathbf{Pos}, and show that its homotopy category is the Barr-exact category \mathbb{C}[P] of partial equivalence relations and compatible functional relations. We give criteria for the the existence of left and right derived functors to functors \mathbb{C}\langle\Phi\rangle : \mathbb{C}\langle P\rangle\to \mathbb{C}\langle Q\rangle induced by finite-meet-preserving transformations {\Phi} : P \to Q.
