We introduce the notion of n-exactness for a short sequence F\to E\to B of pointed types, and show that any fiber sequence F\hookrightarrow E \twoheadrightarrow B of arbitrary types induces a short sequence \|F\|_{n-1} \to \|E\|_{n-1} \to \|B\|_{n-1} that is n-exact at \|E\|_{n-1}. We explain how the indexing makes sense when interpreted in terms of n-groups, and we compare our definition to the existing definitions of an exact sequence of n-groups for n=1,2. In conclusion, we obtain the long n-exact sequence of homotopy n-groups of a fiber sequence.
