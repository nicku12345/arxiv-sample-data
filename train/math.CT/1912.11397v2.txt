Xiao and Zhu has shown that if \cal C is a locally finite triangulated category, then the Auslander-Reiten triangles generate the relations for the Grothendieck group of \cal C. The notion of (d +2)-angulated categories is a "higher dimensional" analogue of triangulated categories. In this article, we show that if A (d+2)-angulated category \cal C is locally finite if and only if the Auslander-Reiten (d+2)-angles generate the relations for the Grothendieck group of \cal C. This extends the result of Xiao and Zhu, and gives the converse of Xiao and Zhu's result is also true.
