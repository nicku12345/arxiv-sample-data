In this paper, we continue our program of systematic categorification of the Noncommutative Differential Geometry of Connes. We replace a ring with a small \mathbb C-linear category, seen as a ring with several objects in the sense of Mitchell. We introduced Fredholm modules over this category and construct a Chern character taking values in the cyclic cohomology of \mathcal C. We show that this categorified Chern character depends only on the homotopy class of the Fredholm module and is well-behaved with respect to the periodicity operator in cyclic cohomology.
