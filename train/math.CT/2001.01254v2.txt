Let \mathcal{M} be a small n-abelian category. We show that the category of absolutely pure group valued functors over \mathcal{M}, denote by \mathcal{L}_2(\mathcal{M},\mathcal{G}), is an abelian category and \mathcal{M} is equivalent to a full subcategory of \mathcal{L}_2(\mathcal{M},\mathcal{G}) in such a way that n-kernels and n-cokernels are precisely exact sequences of \mathcal{L}_2(\mathcal{M},\mathcal{G}) with terms in \mathcal{M}. This gives a higher-dimensional version of the Freyd-Mitchell embedding theorem for n-abelian categories.
