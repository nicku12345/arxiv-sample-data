P. Gabriel showed that for an unital ring R, there exists a bijective correspondence between the set of Gabriel filters of R and the set of Giraud subcategories of \mathrm{Mod}(R) (see \cite[Lemme 1]{Gabriel1} on page 412). In this paper we prove analogous of Gabriel's result: for a small preadditive category \mathcal{C}, there exists a bijective correspondence between the Gabriel filters of \mathcal{C} and Giraud subcategories of \mathrm{Mod}(\mathcal{C}).
