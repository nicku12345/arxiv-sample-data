We study the category of algebras of substitudes (also known to be equivalent to the regular patterns of Getzler) equipped with a (semi)model structure lifted from the model structure on the underlying presheaves. We are especially interested in the case when the model structure on presheaves is a Cisinski style localisation with respect to a proper Grothendieck fundamental localiser. For example, for \mathtt{W}=\mathtt{W}_{\infty} the minimal fundamental localiser, the local objects in such a localisation are locally constant presheaves, and local algebras of substitudes are exactly algebras whose underlying presheaves are locally constant.   We investigate when this localisation has nice properties. We single out a class of such substitudes which we call left localisable and show that the substitudes for n-operads, symmetric, and braided operads are in this class. As an application we develop a homotopy theory of higher braided operads and prove a stabilisation theorem for their \mathtt{W}_k-localisations. This theorem implies, in particular, a generalisation of the Baez-Dolan Stabilisation Hypothesis for higher categories.
