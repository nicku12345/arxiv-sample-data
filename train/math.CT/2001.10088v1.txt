We define filter quotients of (\infty,1)-categories and prove that filter quotients preserve the structure of an elementary (\infty,1)-topos and in particular lift the filter quotient of the underlying elementary topos. We then specialize to the case of filter products of (\infty,1)-categories and prove a characterization theorem for equivalences in a filter product. Then we use filter products to construct a large class of elementary (\infty,1)-toposes that are not Grothendieck (\infty,1)-toposes. Moreover, we give one detailed example for the interested reader who would like to see how we can construct such an (\infty,1)-category, but would prefer to avoid the technicalities regarding filters.
