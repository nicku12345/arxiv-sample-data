Let (\mathcal{C},\mathbb{E},\mathfrak{s}) be an extriangulated category with a proper class \xi of \mathbb{E}-triangles, and \mathcal{W} an additive full subcategory of \mathcal C. We provide a method for constructing a proper \mathcal{W}(\xi)-resolution (respectively, coproper \mathcal{W}(\xi)-coresolution) of one term in an \mathbb{E}-triangle in \xi from that of the other two terms. By using this way, we establish the stability of the Gorenstein category \mathcal{GW}(\xi) in extriangulated categories. These results generalise their work by Huang and Yang-Wang, but the proof is not too far from their case. Finally, we give some applications about our main results.
