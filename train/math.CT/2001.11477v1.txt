This paper is concerned with developing a 2-dimensional analogue of the notion of an ordinary discrete fibration. A definition is proposed, and it is shown that such discrete 2-fibrations correspond via a 2-equivalence to certain category-valued 2-functors. The ultimate goal of the paper is to show that discrete 2-fibrations are 2-monadic over a slice of the 2-category of categories.
