We prove that the tensor category of quasi-coherent modules \mathsf{Qcoh}(X \times_S Y) on a fiber product of quasi-compact quasi-separated schemes is the bicategorical pushout of \mathsf{Qcoh}(X) and \mathsf{Qcoh}(Y) over \mathsf{Qcoh}(S) in the 2-category of cocomplete linear tensor categories. In particular, \mathsf{Qcoh}(X \times Y) is the bicategorical coproduct of \mathsf{Qcoh}(X) and \mathsf{Qcoh}(Y). For this we introduce idals, which can be seen as non-embedded ideals, and use them to study localizations of cocomplete tensor categories in general.
