We study N-differential graded (NDG) categories and their the derived categories. First, we introduce N-differential modules over an NDG category \mathcal{A}. Then we show that the category \mathsf{C}_{Ndg}(\mathcal{A}) of N-differential \mathcal{A}-modules is a Frobenius category, and that its homotopy category \mathsf{K}_{Ndg}(\mathcal{a}) is a triangulated category. Second, we study the properties of the derived category \mathsf{D}_{Ndg}(\mathcal{A}) and give triangle equivalences of Morita type between derived categories of NDG categories. Finally, we show \mathsf{D}_{Ndg}(\mathcal{A}) is triangle equivalent to the derived category of some ordinary DG category.
