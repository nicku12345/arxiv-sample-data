In this paper we formulate and prove a general theorem of stability of exactness properties under the pro-completion, which unifies several such theorems in the literature and gives many more. The theorem depends on a formal approach to exactness properties proposed in this paper, which is based on the theory of sketches. Our stability theorem has applications in proving theorems that establish links between exactness properties, as well as in establishing embedding (representation) theorems for classes of categories defined by exactness properties.
