We exhibit the cartesian differential categories of Blute, Cockett and Seely as a particular kind of enriched category. The base for the enrichment is the category of commutative monoids---or in a straightforward generalisation, the category of modules over a commutative rig k. However, the tensor product on this category is not the usual one, but rather a warping of it by a certain monoidal comonad Q. Thus the enrichment base is not a monoidal category in the usual sense, but rather a skew monoidal category in the sense of Szlach\'anyi. Our first main result is that cartesian differential categories are the same as categories with finite products enriched over this skew monoidal base.   The comonad Q involved is, in fact, an example of a differential modality. Differential modalities are a kind of comonad on a symmetric monoidal k-linear category with the characteristic feature that their co-Kleisli categories are cartesian differential categories. Using our first main result, we are able to prove our second one: that every small cartesian differential category admits a full, structure-preserving embedding into the cartesian differential category induced by a differential modality (in fact, a monoidal differential modality on a monoidal closed category---thus, a model of intuitionistic differential linear logic). This resolves an important open question in this area.
