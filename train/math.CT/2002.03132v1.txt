This paper is a contribution towards a two dimensional extension of the basic ideas and results of Janelidze-Galois theory. In the present paper, we give a suitable counterpart notion to that of \textit{absolute admissible Galois structure} for the lax idempotent context, compatible with the context of \textit{lax orthogonal factorization systems}. As part of this work, we study lax comma 2-categories, giving analogue results to the basic properties of the usual comma categories. We show that each morphism of a 2-category induces a 2-adjunction between lax comma 2-categories and comma 2-categories, playing the role of the usual \textit{change of base functors}. With these induced 2-adjunctions, we are able to show that each 2-adjunction induces 2-adjunctions between lax comma 2-categories and comma 2-categories, which are our analogues of the usual lifting to the comma categories used in Janelidze-Galois theory. We give sufficient conditions under which these liftings are 2-premonadic and induce a lax idempotent 2-monad, which corresponds to our notion of 2-admissible 2-functor. In order to carry out this work, we analyse when a composition of 2-adjunctions is a lax idempotent 2-monad, and when it is 2-premonadic. We give then examples of our 2-admissible 2-functors (and, in particular, simple 2-functors), specially using a result that says that all admissible (2-)functors in the classical sense are also 2-admissible (and hence simple as well). We finish the paper relating coequalizers in lax comma 2-categories and Kan extensions.
