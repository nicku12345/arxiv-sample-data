We aim to reconstruct a monoid scheme X from the category of quasi-coherent sheaves over it. This is much in the vein of Gabriel's original reconstruction theorem. Under some finiteness condition on a monoid schemes X, we show that the localising subcategories of the topos \mathfrak{Qc}(X) of quasi-coherent sheaves on X is in a one-to-one correspondence with open subsets of X, while the elements of X correspond to the topos points of \mathfrak{Qc}(X). This allows us to reconstruct X from \mathfrak{Qc}(X).
