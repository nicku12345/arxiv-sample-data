Each object of any abelian model category has a canonical resolution as described in this article. When the model structure is hereditary we show how morphism sets in the associated homotopy category may be realized as cohomology groups computed from these resolutions. We also give an alternative description of the morphism sets in terms of Yoneda Ext groups.
