It is known that a topological correspondence \((X,\lambda)\) from a locally compact groupoid with a Haar system \((G,\alpha)\) to another one, \((H,\beta)\), produces a \(\textrm{C}^*\)-correspondence \(\mathcal{H}(X,\lambda)\) from \(\textrm{C}^*(G,\alpha)\) to \(\textrm{C}^*(H,\beta)\). In one of our earlier article we described composition two topological correspondences. In the present article, we prove that second countable locally compact Hausdorff topological groupoids with Haar systems form a bicategory \(\mathfrak{T}\) when equipped with a topological correspondences as 1-arrows. The equivariant homeomorphisms of topological correspondences preserving the families of measures are the 2-arrows in~\(\mathfrak{T}\). One the other hand, it well-known that \(\textrm{C}^*\)-algebras form a bicateogry \(\mathfrak{C}\) with \(\textrm{C}^*\)-correspondences as 1-arrows. The 2-arrows in \(\mathfrak{C}\) are unitaries of Hilbert \(\textrm{C}^*\)-modules that intertwine the representations. In this article, we show that a topological correspondence going to a \(\textrm{C}^*\)-one is a bifunctor~\(\mathfrak{T}\to\mathfrak{C}\).
