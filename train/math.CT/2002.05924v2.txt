Just like group actions are represented by group automorphisms, Lie algebra actions are represented by derivations: up to isomorphism, a split extension of a Lie algebra B by a Lie algebra X corresponds to a Lie algebra morphism B\to \mathit{Der}(X) from B to the Lie algebra \mathit{Der}(X) of derivations on X. In this article, we study the question whether the concept of a derivation can be extended to other types of non-associative algebras over a field \mathbb{K}, in such a way that these generalised derivations characterise the \mathbb{K}-algebra actions. We prove that the answer is no, as soon as the field \mathbb{K} is infinite. In fact, we prove a stronger result: already the representability of all abelian actions -- which are usually called representations or Beck modules -- suffices for this to be true. Thus we characterise the variety of Lie algebras over an infinite field of characteristic different from 2 as the only variety of non-associative algebras which is a non-abelian category with representable representations. This emphasises the unique role played by the Lie algebra of linear endomorphisms \mathfrak{gl}(V) as a representing object for the representations on a vector space V.
