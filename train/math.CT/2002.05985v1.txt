It is shown that the category of semi-biproducts in monoids is equivalent to a category of pseudo-actions. A semi-biproduct in monoids is at the same time a generalization of a semi-direct product in groups and a biproduct in commutative monoids. Every Schreier extension of monoids can be seen as an instance of a semi-biproduct; namely a semi-biproduct whose associated pseudo-action has a trivial correction system. A correction system is a new ingredient that must be inserted in order to obtain a pseudo-action out of a pre-action and a factor system. In groups, every correction system is trivial. Hence, semi-biproducts there are the same as semi-direct products with a factor system, which are nothing but group extensions. An attempt to establish a general context in which to define semi-biproducts is made. As a result, a new structure of map-transformations is obtained from a category with a 2-cell structure. Examples and first basic properties are briefly explored.
