The paper is devoted to a kind of `very non-abelian' spectral categories. Under strong conditions on a category \mathcal{X}, we prove, among other things, that, for a given faithful localization \mathcal{C}\to\mathcal{X}, we have canonical equivalences \mathrm{Spec}(\mathcal{C})\sim\mathcal{X}\sim(\mathrm{Category\,\,of\,\,injective\,\,objects\,\,in}\,\, \mathcal{C}), and that \mathcal{C} has natural injective envelopes.
