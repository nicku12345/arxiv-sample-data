Let \cA be a Grothendieck category and let M be an object of \cA. In this paper, we define a dimension over M via chain of atoms in \ASupp M and we show that it is a lower bound of Gabriel-Krull dimension of M and in the case where \ASpec\cA is an Alexandroff topological space, they are the same. We also show that this dimension establishes a new characterization for those categories \cA which ASpec\cA are Alexandroff topological spaces. We study the minimal atoms of a noetherian object and we give a sufficient condition for finiteness of the number of minimal atoms of a noetherian object.
