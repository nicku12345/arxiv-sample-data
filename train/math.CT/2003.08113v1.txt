The category of internal coalgebras in a cocomplete category \mathcal{C} with respect to a variety \mathcal{V} is equivalent to the category of left adjoint functors from \mathcal{V} into \mathcal{C}. This can be seen best when considering such coalgebras as finite coproduct preserving functors from \mathcal{T}_\mathcal{V}^\mathsf{op}, the dual of the Lawvere theory of \mathcal{V}, into \mathcal{C}: coalgebras are restrictions of left adjoints and any such left adjoint is the left Kan extension of a coalgebra along the embedding of \mathcal{T}_\mathcal{V}^\mathsf{op} into \mathsf{Alg}\mathcal{T}. Since {_S\mathit{Mod}}-coalgebras in the variety {_R\mathit{Mod}} for rings R and S are nothing but left S-, right R-bimodules, the equivalence above generalizes the Eilenberg-Watts Theorem and all its previous generalizations. Generalizing and strengthening Bergman's completeness result for categories of internal coalgebras in varieties we also prove that the category of coalgebras in a locally presentable category \mathcal{C} is locally presentable and comonadic over \mathcal{C} and, hence, complete in particular. We show, moreover, that Freyd's canonical constructions of internal coalgebras in a variety define left adjoint functors. Special instances of the respective right adjoints appear in various algebraic contexts and, in the case where \mathcal{V} is a commutative variety, are coreflectors from the category \mathsf{Coalg}(\mathcal{T},\mathcal{V}) into \mathcal{V}.
