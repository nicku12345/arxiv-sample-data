We construct an (\infty,2)-version of the (lax) Gray tensor product. On the 1-categorical level, this is a binary (or more generally an n-ary) functor on the category of \Theta_2-sets, and it is shown to be left Quillen with respect to Ara's model structure. Moreover we prove that this tensor product forms part of a "homotopical" (biclosed) monoidal structure, or more precisely a normal lax monoidal structure that is associative up to homotopy.
