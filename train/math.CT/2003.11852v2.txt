Let (\mathcal{C},\mathbb{E},\mathfrak{s}) be an extriangulated category with a proper class \xi of \mathbb{E}-triangles. In this paper, we study complete cohomology of objects in (\mathcal{C},\mathbb{E},\mathfrak{s}) by applying \xi-projective resolutions and \xi-injective coresolutions constructed in (\mathcal{C},\mathbb{E},\mathfrak{s}). Vanishing of complete cohomology detects objects with finite \xi-projective dimension and finite \xi-injective dimension. As a consequence, we obtain some criteria for the validity of the Wakamatsu Tilting Conjecture and give a necessary and sufficient condition for a virtually Gorenstein algebra to be Gorenstein. Moreover, we give a general technique for computing complete cohomology of objects with finite \xi-\mathcal{G}projective dimension. As an application, the relationships between \xi-projective dimensions and \xi-\mathcal{G}projective dimensions for objects in (\mathcal{C},\mathbb{E},\mathfrak{s}) are given.
