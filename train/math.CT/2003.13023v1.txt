We discuss the following problem: how can an arbitrary Fourier-Mukai transform \phi: \mathrm{D}^{\mathrm{b}}( \mathbb{P}^a ) \rightarrow \mathrm{D}^{\mathrm{b}}( \mathbb{P}^b ) between the bounded derived categories of two projective spaces of dimensions a and b be expressed in explicit terms as an exact functor between the homotopy categories \mathrm{K}^{\mathrm{b}}( \mathbb{B}^a ) \rightarrow \mathrm{K}^{\mathrm{b}}( \mathbb{B}^b ) generated by the full strong exceptional sequences of the line bundles \mathbb{B}^a = \{\mathcal{O}(-a), \dots, \mathcal{O}\} and \mathbb{B}^b = \{\mathcal{O}(-b), \dots, \mathcal{O}\}? We show that this problem can be reduced to the following task which is independent of any prescribed Fourier-Mukai kernel: finding an A_{\infty}-functor P in explicit terms whose induced functor on homotopy categories yields the embedding of \{ \mathcal{O}(i) \boxtimes \mathcal{O}(j) \mid i = -2a, \dots, 0, ~~j = -2b, \dots 0 \} into \mathrm{D}^{\mathrm{b}}( \mathbb{P}^{a} \times \mathbb{P}^{b}).   As our main technical tool we provide an explicit formula for the lift of an A_{\infty}-functor F: \mathbf{A} \rightarrow \mathbf{B} between a dg category \mathbf{A} and a pretriangulated dg category \mathbf{B} to the pretriangulated hull of \mathbf{A} given by the universal property of pretriangulated hulls. As a further application of this tool, we provide a simple example of two non-isomorphic exact functors between triangulated categories that coincide on the full subcategory generated by a full strong exceptional sequence.
