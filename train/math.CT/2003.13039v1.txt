We introduce a notion of n-commutativity (0\le n\le \infty) for cosimplicial monoids in a symmetric monoidal category {\bf V}, where n=0 corresponds to just cosimplicial monoids in {\bf V,} while n=\infty corresponds to commutative cosimplicial monoids. If {\bf V} has a monoidal model structure we show (under some mild technical conditions) that the total object of an n-cosimplicial monoid has a natural E_{n+1}-algebra structure.   Our main applications are to the deformation theory of tensor categories and tensor functors. We show that the deformation complex of a tensor functor is a total complex of a 1-commutative cosimplicial monoid and, hence, has an E_2-algebra structure similar to the E_2-structure on Hochschild complex of an associative algebra provided by Deligne's conjecture. We further demonstrate that the deformation complex of a tensor category is the total complex of a 2-commutative cosimplicial monoid and, therefore, is naturally an E_3-algebra. We make these structures very explicit through a language of Delannoy paths and their noncommutative liftings. We investigate how these structures manifest themselves in concrete examples.
