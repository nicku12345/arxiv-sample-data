For \mathcal{C} a finite tensor category we consider four versions of the central monad, A_1, \dots, A_4 on \mathcal{C}. Two of them are Hopf monads, and for \mathcal{C} pivotal, so are the remaining two. In that case all A_i are isomorphic as Hopf monads. We define a monadic cointegral for A_i to be an A_i-module morphism \mathbf{1} \to A_i(D), where D is the distinguished invertible object of \mathcal{C}. We relate monadic cointegrals to the categorical cointegral introduced by Shimizu (2019), and, in case \mathcal{C} is braided, to an integral for the braided Hopf algebra \mathcal{L} = \int^X X^\vee \otimes X in \mathcal{C} studied by Lyubashenko (1995). Our main motivation stems from the application to finite dimensional quasi-Hopf algebras H. For the category of finite-dimensional H-modules, we relate the four monadic cointegrals (two of which require H to be pivotal) to four existing notions of cointegrals for quasi-Hopf algebras: the usual left/right cointegrals of Hausser and Nill (1994), as well as so-called \gamma-symmetrised cointegrals in the pivotal case, for \gamma the modulus of H. For (not necessarily semisimple) modular tensor categories \mathcal{C}, Lyubashenko gave actions of surface mapping class groups on certain Hom-spaces of \mathcal{C}, in particular of SL(2,\mathbb{Z}) on \mathcal{C}(\mathcal{L},\mathbf{1}). In the case of a factorisable ribbon quasi-Hopf algebra, we give a simple expression for the action of S and T which uses the monadic cointegral.
