For a small quantaloid \mathcal{Q}, it is shown that the category of \mathcal{Q}-distributors and diagonals is equivalent to a quotient category of the category of \mathcal{Q}-interior spaces and continuous \mathcal{Q}-distributors. Kan adjunctions induced by \mathcal{Q}-distributors play a crucial role in establishing this equivalence.
