Split opfibrations are functors equipped with a suitable choice of opcartesian lifts. The purpose of this paper is to characterise internal split opfibrations through separating the structure of a suitable choice of lifts from the property of these lifts being opcartesian. The underlying structure of an internal split opfibration is captured by an internal functor equipped with an internal cofunctor, while the property may be expressed as a pullback condition, akin to the simple condition on an internal functor to be an internal discrete opfibration. Furthermore, this approach provides two additional characterisations of internal split opfibrations, via the d\'ecalage construction and strict factorisation systems. For small categories, this theory clarifies several aspects of delta lenses which arise in computer science.
