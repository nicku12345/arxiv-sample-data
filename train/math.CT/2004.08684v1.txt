The groupoid of finite sets has a "canonical" structure of a symmetric 2-rig with the sum and product respectively given by the coproduct and product of sets. This 2-rig \widehat{\mathbb{F}\mathbb{S} et} is just one of the many non-equivalent categorifications of the commutative rig \mathbb{N} of natural numbers, together with the rig \mathbb{N} itself viewed as a discrete rig category, the whole category of finite sets, the category of finite dimensional vector spaces over a field k, etc. In this paper it is shown that \widehat{\mathbb{F}\mathbb{S} et} is the right categorification of \mathbb{N} in the sense that it is biinitial in the 2-category of rig categories, in the same way as \mathbb{N} is initial in the category of rigs. As a by-product, an explicit description of the homomorphisms of rig categories from a suitable version of \widehat{\mathbb{F}\mathbb{S} et} into any (semistrict) rig category \mathbb{S} is obtained in terms of a sequence of automorphisms of the objects 1+\stackrel{n)}{\cdots}+1 in \mathbb{S} for each n\geq 0.
