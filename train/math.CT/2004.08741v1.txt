Internal categories feature notions of limit and completeness, as originally proposed in the context of the effective topos. This paper sets out the theory of internal completeness in a general context, spelling out the details of the definitions of limit and completeness and clarifying some subtleties. Remarkably, complete internal categories are also cocomplete and feature a suitable version of the adjoint functor theorem. Such results are understood as consequences of the intrinsic smallness of internal categories.
