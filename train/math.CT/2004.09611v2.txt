The annulus comes with a "stacking" operation which glues two annuli into one. This provides a tensor product structure on the category of boundary values Z_{\text{CY}}(\text{Ann}) associated to the annulus in an extended Crane-Yetter TQFT. It is known that Z_{\text{CY}}(\text{Ann}) \simeq \mathcal{Z}(\mathcal{A}), the Drinfeld center of the premodular category \mathcal{A} from which Z_{\text{CY}} is constructed. We give an explicit formula for the tensor product on \mathcal{Z}(\mathcal{A}) that corresponds to the stacking operation on Z_{\text{CY}}(\text{Ann}).
