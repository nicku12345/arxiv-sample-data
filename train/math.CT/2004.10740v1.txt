We continue the work started in parts (I) and (II) ([13] and [21], respectively). In this part we classify which continuous type A quivers are derived equivalent and introduce the new continuous cluster category with \mathbf E-clusters, which are a generalization of clusters. In the middle we provide a rigorous connection between the previous construction of the continuous cluster category and the new construction. We conclude with the introduction of a cluster theory, generalizing the notion of a cluster structure. Using this new notion, we demonstrate how one embeds known type A cluster theories into the new \mathbf E-cluster theory in a way compatible with mutation. This is part (III) in a series of work that will conclude with a continuous generalization of mutation for cluster theories.
