We continue the work of parts (I), (II), and (III) of this series ([15], [23], and [16], respectively). In this final paper of the series we begin with a continuous generalization of mutation used to unify some existing types of mutation as well as allow for new types of mutation. We introduce the space of mutations which generalizes the exchange graph of a cluster structure. Then we complete the relationships of known type A cluster theories (introduced in part (III)). We define an abstract cluster structure and relate some known type A cluster structures which coincide with their previous definitions. We conclude by constructing geometric models of \mathbf E-clusters (the new continuous clusters from part (III)) which generalize the existing geometric models of type A clusters. Along the way we pose open questions about classifications of the space of mutations and continuous type A cluster theories.
