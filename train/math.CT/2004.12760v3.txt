There are two obvious approaches to a definition of unitarity for pseudonatural transformations between unitary pseudofunctors on pivotal dagger 2-categories. The first is to require that the 2-morphism components of the transformation be unitary. The second is to require that the dagger of the transformation be equal to its inverse. We show that the `inverse' making these definitions equivalent is the right dual of the transformation in the 2-category Fun(C,D) of unitary pseudofunctors C->D, unitary pseudonatural transformations, and modifications. When restricted to unitary pseudonatural transformations, we show that the 2-category Fun(C,D) is a pivotal dagger 2-category. We apply these results to obtain a Morita-theoretical classification of unitary pseudonatural transformations between fibre functors on the category of representations of a compact quantum group.
