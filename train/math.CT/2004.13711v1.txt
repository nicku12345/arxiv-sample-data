Let (\mathcal{C},\mathbb{E},\mathfrak{s}) be an extriangulated category with a proper class \xi of \mathbb{E}-triangles. In this paper, we study the balance of complete cohomology in (\mathcal{C},\mathbb{E},\mathfrak{s}), which is motivated by a result of Nucinkis that complete cohomology of modules is not balanced in the way the absolute cohomology Ext is balanced. As an application, we give some criteria for identifying a triangulated catgory to be Gorenstein and an artin algebra to be F-Gorenstein.
