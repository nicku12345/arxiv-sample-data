We introduce a notion of normalised oplax 3-functor suitable for the elementary homotopy theory of strict 3-categories, following the combinatorics of orientals. We show that any such morphism induces a morphism of simplicial sets between the Street nerves and we characterise those morphisms of simplicial sets coming from normalised oplax 3-functors. This allows us to prove that normalised oplax 3-functors compose. Finally we construct a strictification for normalised oplax 3-functors whose source is a 1-category without split-monos or split-epis.
