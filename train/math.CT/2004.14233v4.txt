We construct a model structure on the category \mathrm{DblCat} of double categories and double functors. Unlike previous model structures for double categories, it recovers the homotopy theory of 2-categories through the horizontal embedding functor \mathbb{H}\colon 2\mathrm{Cat}\to\mathrm{DblCat}, which is both left and right Quillen, and homotopically fully faithful. Furthermore, we show that Lack's model structure on 2\mathrm{Cat} is both left- and right-induced along \mathbb{H} from our model structure on \mathrm{DblCat}. In addition, we obtain a 2\mathrm{Cat}-enrichment of our model structure on \mathrm{DblCat}, by using a variant of the Gray tensor product.   Under certain conditions, we prove a version of the Whitehead theorem, characterizing our weak equivalences as the double functors which admit an inverse pseudo double functor up to horizontal pseudo natural equivalence. This retrieves the Whitehead theorem for 2-categories as a special case.   Analogous statements hold for the category \mathrm{wkDblCat}_s of weak double categories and strict double functors, whose homotopy theory recovers that of bicategories through the horizontal embedding. Moreover, we show that the full embedding \mathrm{DblCat}\to\mathrm{wkDblCat}_s is a Quillen equivalence.
