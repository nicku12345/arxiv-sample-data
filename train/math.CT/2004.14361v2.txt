Convergent rewriting systems on algebraic structures give methods to solve decision problems, to prove coherence results, and to compute homological invariants. These methods are based on higher-dimensional extensions of the critical branching lemma that characterizes local confluence from confluence of the critical branchings. The analysis of local confluence of rewriting systems on algebraic structures, such as groups or linear algebras, is complicated because of the underlying algebraic axioms, and in some situations, local confluence properties require additional termination conditions. This article introduces the structure of algebraic polygraph modulo that formalizes the interaction between the rules of an algebraic rewriting system and the inherent algebraic axioms, and we show a critical branching lemma for algebraic polygraphs. We deduce from this result a critical branching lemma for rewriting systems on algebraic objects whose axioms are specified by convergent modulo rewriting systems. We illustrate our constructions for string, linear, and group rewriting systems.
