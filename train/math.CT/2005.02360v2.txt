In a previous work, we have introduced a weakening of Quillen model categories called weak model categories. They still allow all the usual constructions of model category theory, but are easier to construct and are in some sense better behaved. In this paper we continue to develop their general theory by introducing combinatorial and accessible weak model categories. We give simple necessary and sufficient conditions under which such a weak model category can be extended into a left and/or right semi-model category. As an application, we recover Cisinski-Olschok theory and generalize it to weak and semi-model categories. We also provide general existence theorems for both left and right Bousfield localization of combinatorial and accessible weak model structures, which combined with the results above gives existence results for left and right Bousfield localization of combinatorial and accessible left and right semi-model categories, generalizing previous results of Barwick. Surprisingly,we show that any left or right Bousfield localization of an accessible or combinatorial Quillen model category always exists, without properness assumptions, and is simultaneously both a left and a right semi-model category, without necessarily being a Quillen model category itself.
