We introduce a notion of enriched \infty-categories over a suitable monoidal category, in analogy with quasi-categories over the category of sets. We make use of certain colax monoidal functors, which we call templicial objects, as a variant of simplicial objects respecting the monoidal structure. We relate the resulting enriched quasi-categories to nonassociative Frobenius monoidal functors, allowing us to prove that the free templicial module over an ordinary quasi-category is a linear quasi-category. To any dg-category we associate a linear quasi-category, the linear dg-nerve, which enhances the classical dg-nerve. Finally, we prove an equivalence between (homologically) non-negatively graded dg-categories on the one hand and templicial modules with a Frobenius structure on the other hand, indicating that nonassociative Frobenius templicial modules and linear quasi-categories can be seen as relaxations of dg-categories.
