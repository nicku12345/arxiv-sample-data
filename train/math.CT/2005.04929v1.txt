The categorical compositional distributional model of meaning gives the composition of words into phrases and sentences pride of place. However, it has so far lacked a model of logical negation. This paper gives some steps towards providing this operator, modelling it as a version of projection onto the subspace orthogonal to a word. We give a small demonstration of the operators performance in a sentence entailment task.
