For any 0-cell B in a 2-category \Bc we introduce the notion of adjoint algebra \adj_B. This is an algebra in the center of \Bc. We prove that, if \ca is a finite tensor category, this notion applied to the 2-category of \ca-module categories, coincides with the one introduced by Shimizu [Further results on the structure of (Co)ends in fintite tensor categories}, Appl. Categor. Struct. (2019). https://doi.org/10.1007/s10485-019-09577-7]. As a consequence of this general approach, we obtain new results on the adjoint algebra for tensor categories.
