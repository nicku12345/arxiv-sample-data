We show that for any quantale \mathcal{Q}, a \mathcal{Q}-category is skeletal and complete if and only if it is injective with respect to fully faithful \mathcal{Q}-functors. This is a special case of known theorems due to Hofmann and Stubbe, but we provide a different proof, using the characterisation of the MacNeille completion of a \mathcal{Q}-category as its injective envelope. For Lawvere metric spaces, our results yield those of Kemajou, K\"unzi and Otafudu. We point out that their notion of Isbell convexity can be seen as a geometric expression of categorical completeness for Lawvere metric spaces.
