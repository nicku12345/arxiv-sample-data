The paper focuses on investigating how certain relations between strict n-categories are preserved in a particular implementation of (\infty,n)-categories, given by saturated n-complicial sets. In this model, we show that the (\infty,n)-categorical nerve of n-categories is homotopically compatible with 1-categorical suspension and wedge. As an application, we show that certain pushouts encoding composition in n-categories are homotopy pushouts of saturated n-complicial sets.
