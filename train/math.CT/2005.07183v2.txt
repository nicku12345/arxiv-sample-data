An object P in a monoidal category \mathcal{C} is called pivotal if its left dual and right dual objects are isomorphic. Given such an object and a choice of dual Q, we construct the category \mathcal{C}(P,Q), of objects which intertwine with P and Q in a compatible manner. We show that this category lifts the monoidal structure of \mathcal{C} and the closed structure of \mathcal{C}, when \mathcal{C} is closed. If \mathcal{C} has suitable colimits we show that \mathcal{C}(P,Q) is monadic and thereby construct a family of Hopf monads on arbitrary closed monoidal categories \mathcal{C}. We also introduce the pivotal cover of a monoidal category and extend our work to arbitrary pivotal diagrams.
