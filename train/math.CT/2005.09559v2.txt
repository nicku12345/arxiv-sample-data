We introduce a general construction on 2-monads. We develop background on maps of 2-monads, their left semi-algebras, and colimits in 2-category. Then, we introduce the construction of a colimit induced by a map of 2-monads, show that we obtain the structure of a 2-monad and give a characterisation of its algebras. Finally, we apply the construction to the map of 2-monads between free symmetric monoidal and the free cartesian 2-monads and combine them into a linear-non-linear 2-monad.
