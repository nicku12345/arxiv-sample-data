Let \mathcal{A} be a small abelian category. The purpose of this paper is to introduce and study a category \overline{\mathcal{A}} which implicitly appears in construction of some TQFTs where \overline{\mathcal{A}} is determined by \mathcal{A}. If \mathcal{A} is the category of abelian groups, then the TQFTs obtained by Dijkgraaf-Witten theory of abelian groups or Turaev-Viro theory of bicommutative Hopf algebras factor through \overline{\mathcal{A}} up to a scaling. In this paper, we go further by giving a sufficient condition for an \mathcal{A}-valued Brown functor to extend to a homotopy-theoretic analogue of \overline{\mathcal{A}}-valued TQFT for arbitrary \mathcal{A}. The results of this paper and our subsequent paper reproduces TQFTs obtained by DW theory and TV theory.
