In this essay we propose a realization of Lurie's claim that inner fibrations p: X \rightarrow C are classified by C-indexed diangrams in a "higher category" whose objects are \infty-categories, morphisms are correspondences between them and higher morphisms are higher correspondences. We will obtain this as a corollary of a more general result which classifies all simplicial maps.   Correspondences between \infty-categories, and simplicial sets in general, are a generalization of the concept of profunctor (or bimodule) for categories. While categories, functors and profunctors are organized in a double category, we will exibit simplicial sets, simplicial maps, and correspondences as part of a simpliclal category. This allows us to make precise statements and proofs. Our main tool is the theory of double colimits.
