Properties of categories enriched over the category of metric spaces are investigated and applied to a study of constructions known from that category and the category of Banach spaces. For every class of morphisms satisfying a mild smallness condition we prove the corresponding approximate-injectivity class is weakly reflective, and we study the properties of the reflection morphisms. As an application we present a new categorical proof of the essential uniqueness of the Gurarii space.
