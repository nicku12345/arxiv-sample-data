This is a short introductory course to Set Theory, based on axioms of von Neumann--Bernays--G\"odel (briefly NBG). The text can be used as a base for a lecture course in Foundations of Mathematics, and contains a reasonable minimum which a good (post-graduate) student in Mathematics should know about foundations of this science.
