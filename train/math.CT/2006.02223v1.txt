Herschend-Liu-Nakaoka introduced the notion of n-exangulated categories. It is not only a higher dimensional analogue of extriangulated categories defined by Nakaoka-Palu, but also gives a simultaneous generalization of n-exact categories in the sense of Jasso and (n+2)-angulated in the sense of Geiss-Keller-Oppermann. Let \mathscr C be an n-exangulated category with enough projectives and enough injectives, and \mathscr X a cluster tilting subcategory of \mathscr C. In this article, we show that the quotient category \mathscr C/\mathscr X is an n-abelian category. This extends a result of Zhou-Zhu for (n+2)-angulated categories. Moreover, it highlights new phenomena when it is applied to n-exact categories.
