In the topos approach to quantum theory, the spectral presheaf plays the role of the state space of a quantum system. We show how a notion of entropy can be defined within the topos formalism using the equivalence between states and measures on the spectral presheaf. We show how this construction unifies Shannon and von Neumann entropy as well as classical and quantum Renyi entropies. The main result is that from the knowledge of the contextual entropy of a quantum state of a finite-dimensional system, one can (mathematically) reconstruct the quantum state, i.e., the density matrix, if the Hilbert space is of dimension 3 or greater. We present an explicit algorithm for this state reconstruction and relate our result to Gleason's theorem.
