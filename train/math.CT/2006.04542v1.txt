Let (\mathcal{C},\mathbb{E},\mathfrak{s}) be an extriangulated category with a proper class \xi of \mathbb{E}-triangles. In this paper, we first introduce the \xi-Gorenstein cohomology in terms of \xi-\mathcal{G}projective resolutions and \xi-\mathcal{G}injective coresolutions, respectively, and then we get the balance of \xi-Gorenstein cohomology. Moreover, we study the interplay among \xi-cohomology, \xi-Gorenstein cohomology and \xi-complete cohomology, and obtain the Avramov-Martsinkovsky type exact sequences in this setting.
