Extriangulated categories were introduced by Nakaoka and Palu as a simultaneous generalization of exact categories and triangulated categories. In this paper, we introduce and develop an analogous theory of Auslander-Buchweitz approximations for extriangulated categories. We establish the existence of precovers pand preenvelopesq and obtain characterizations of relative homological dimensions, which are based on certain subcategories under finiteness of resolutions. Finally, we give a description of cotorsion pairs on extriangulated categories under some conditions, and provide a characterization of silting subcategories on stable categories. Keywords: Extriangulated category; Homological dimension; Cogenerator; Cotorsion pair.
