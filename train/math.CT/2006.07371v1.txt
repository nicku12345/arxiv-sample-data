We prove that any right Quillen functor between arbitrary model categories admits non trivial functorial factorizations that are similar to those of a model structure. We also prove that these factorizations can be made for lax monoidal right Quillen functors. Given a monad, operad or a PROP(erad) \mathcal{O}, if we apply one of the factorizations to the forgetful functor \mathcal{U} : \mathcal{O}-Alg(\mathcal{M}) \rightarrow \mathcal{M}, we extend the theory of Quillen-Segal \mathcal{O}-algebras without the hypothesis of \mathcal{M} being a combinatorial model category.
