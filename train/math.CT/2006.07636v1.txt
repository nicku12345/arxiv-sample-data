Let \Omega \subset {R}^n, n \geq 3, be a bounded open set, x=(x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n) a generic point which belongs to \Omega, u \colon \Omega \to {R}^N , N>1, and  Du=(D_\alpha u^i), D_\alpha = \partial/\partial x_\alpha,  \alpha =1,\ldots,n,\, i=1,\ldots,N .\,   Main goal is the study of regularity of the minima of nondifferentiable functionals  {\cal F} \,=\, \int_\Omega F(x,u,Du) dx.  having the integrand function different shapes of smoothness. The method is based on the use some majorizations for the functional, rather than the well known Euler equation associated to it.
