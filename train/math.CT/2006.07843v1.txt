We prove a weak adjoint functor theorem in the setting of categories enriched in a monoidal model category \mathcal V admitting certain limits. When \mathcal V is equipped with the trivial model structure this recaptures the enriched version of Freyd's adjoint functor theorem. For non-trivial model structures, we obtain new weak adjoint functor theorems of a homotopical flavour - in particular, when \mathcal V is the category of simplical sets we obtain a homotopical adjoint functor theorem appropriate to the \infty-cosmoi of Riehl and Verity. We also investigate accessibility in the enriched setting, in particular obtaining homotopical cocompleteness results for accessible \infty-cosmoi.
