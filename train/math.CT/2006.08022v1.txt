We classify various types of graded extensions of a finite braided tensor category \cal B in terms of its 2-categorical Picard groups. In particular, we prove that braided extensions of \cal B by a finite group A correspond to braided monoidal 2-functors from A to the braided 2-categorical Picard group of \cal B (consisting of invertible central \cal B-module categories). Such functors can be expressed in terms of the Eilnberg-Mac~Lane cohomology. We describe in detail braided 2-categorical Picard groups of symmetric fusion categories and of pointed braided fusion categories.
