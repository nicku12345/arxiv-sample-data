In this paper, we construct a kind of new braided monoidal category over two Hom-Hopf algerbas (H,\alpha) and (B,\beta) and associate it with two nonlinear equations. We first introduce the notion of an (H,B)-Hom-Long dimodule and show that the Hom-Long dimodule category ^{B}_{H} \Bbb L is an autonomous category. Second, we prove that the category ^{B}_{H} \Bbb L is a braided monoidal category if (H,\alpha) is quasitriangular and (B,\beta) is coquasitriangular and get a solution of the quantum Yang-Baxter equation. Also, we show that the category ^{B}_{H} \Bbb L can be viewed as a subcategory of the Hom-Yetter-Drinfeld category ^{H\o B}_{H\o B} \Bbb {HYD}. Finally, we obtain a solution of the Hom-Long equation from the Hom-Long dimodules.
