We show that weak monoidal Quillen equivalences induce equivalences of symmetric monoidal \infty-categories with respect to the Dwyer-Kan localization of the symmetric monoidal model categories. The result will induce a Dold-Kan correspondance of coalgebras in \infty-categories. Moreover it shows that Shipley's zig-zag of Quillen equivalences provides an explicit symmetric monoidal equivalence of \infty-categories for the stable Dold-Kan correspondance. We study homotopy coherent coalgebras associated to a monoidal model category and we show that these coalgebras cannot be rigidified. That is, their \infty-categories are not equivalent to the Dwyer-Kan localizations of strict coalgebras in the usual monoidal model categories of spectra and of connective discrete R-modules.
