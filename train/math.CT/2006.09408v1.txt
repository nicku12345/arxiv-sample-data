We prove that given \mathcal{C} a presentably symmetric monoidal \infty-category, and any essentially small \infty-operad \mathcal{O}, the \infty-category of \mathcal{O}-algebras in \mathcal{C} is enriched, tensored and cotensored over the presentably symmetric monoidal \infty-category of \mathcal{O}-coalgebras in \mathcal{C}. We provide a higher categorical analogue of the universal measuring coalgebra. For categories in the usual sense, the result was proved by Hyland, L\'{o}pez Franco, and Vasilakopoulou.
