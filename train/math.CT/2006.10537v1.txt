Cosetal extensions of monoids generalise extensions of groups and special Schreier extensions of monoids, amongst others. They share a number of properties with group extensions, including a notion of Baer sum. However, unlike group extensions (with fixed kernel and cokernel) there may be nontrivial morphisms between them. We explore the structure of the category of cosetal extensions and relate it to an analogue of second cohomology groups. Finally, the order structure and additive structures are combined to give an indexed family of inverse semigroups of extensions. These in turn can be combined into an inverse category.
