We introduce partially lax limits of infinity-categories, which interpolate between ordinary limits and lax limits. Most naturally occurring examples of lax limits are only partially lax; we give examples arising from enriched categories and operads. Our main result is a formula for partially lax limits and colimits in terms of the Grothendieck construction. This generalizes a formula of Lurie for ordinary limits and of Gepner-Haugseng-Nikolaus for fully lax limits.
