We introduce the right (left) Gorenstein subcategory relative to an additive subcategory \C of an abelian category \A, and prove that the right Gorenstein subcategory r\mathcal{G}(\mathscr{C}) is closed under extensions, kernels of epimorphisms, direct summands and finite direct sums. When \C is self-orthogonal, we give a characterization for objects in r\mathcal{G}(\mathscr{C}), and prove that any object in \A with finite r\mathcal{G}(\C)-projective dimension is isomorphic to a kernel (resp. a cokernel) of a morphism from an object in \A with finite \C-projective dimension to an object in r\mathcal{G}(\C). As an application, we obtain a weak Auslander-Buchweitz context related to the kernel of a hereditary cotorsion pair in \A having enough injectives.
