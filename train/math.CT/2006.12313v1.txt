For a ring R and an additive subcategory \C of the category \Mod R of left R-modules, under some conditions we prove that the right Gorenstein subcategory of \Mod R and the left Gorenstein subcategory of \Mod R^{op} relative to \C form a coproduct-closed duality pair. Let R,S be rings and C a semidualizing (R,S)-bimodule. As applications of the above result, we get that if S is right coherent and C is faithfully semidualizing, then (\mathcal{GF}_C(R),\mathcal{GI}_C(R^{op})) is a coproduct-closed duality pair and \mathcal{GF}_C(R) is covering in \Mod R, where \mathcal{G}\mathcal{F}_C(R) is the subcategory of \Mod R consisting of C-Gorenstein flat modules and \mathcal{G}\mathcal{I}_C(R^{op}) is the subcategory of \Mod R^{op} consisting of C-Gorenstein injective modules; we also get that if S is right coherent, then (\mathcal{A}_C(R^{op}),l\mathcal{G}(\mathcal{F}_C(R))) is a coproduct-closed and product-closed duality pair and \mathcal{A}_C(R^{op}) is covering and preenveloping in \Mod R^{op}, where \mathcal{A}_C(R^{op}) is the Auslander class in \Mod R^{op} and l\mathcal{G}(\mathcal{F}_C(R)) is the left Gorenstein subcategory of \Mod R relative to C-flat modules.
