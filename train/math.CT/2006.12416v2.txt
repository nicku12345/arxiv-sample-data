Given a marked \infty-category \mathcal{D}^{\dagger} (i.e. an \infty-category equipped with a specified collection of morphisms) and a functor F: \mathcal{D} \to \mathbb{B} with values in an \infty-bicategory, we define \operatorname{colim}^{\dagger} F, the marked colimit of F. We provide a definition of weighted colimits in \infty-bicategories when the indexing diagram is an \infty-category and show that they can be computed in terms of marked colimits. In the maximally marked case \mathcal{D}^{\sharp}, our construction retrieves the \infty-categorical colimit of F in the underlying \infty-category \mathcal{B} \subseteq \mathbb{B}. In the specific case when \mathbb{B}=\mathfrak{Cat}_{\infty}, the \infty-bicategory of \infty-categories and \mathcal{D}^{\flat} is minimally marked, we recover the definition of lax colimit of Gepner-Haugseng-Nikolaus. We show that a suitable \infty-localization of the associated coCartesian fibration \operatorname{Un}_{\mathcal{D}}(F) computes \operatorname{colim}^{\dagger} F. Our main theorem is a characterization of those functors of marked \infty-categories f:\mathcal{C}^{\dagger} \to \mathcal{D}^{\dagger} which are marked cofinal. More precisely, we provide sufficient and necessary criteria for the restriction of diagrams along f to preserve marked colimits.
