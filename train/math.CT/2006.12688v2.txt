In this paper, we give an axiomatization of the ordinal number system, in the style of Dedekind's axiomatization of the natural number system. The latter is based on a structure (N,0,s) consisting of a set N, a distinguished element 0\in N and a function s\colon N\to N. The structure in our axiomatization is a triple (O,L,s), where O is a class, L is a function defined on all s-closed `subsets' of O, and s is a class function s\colon O\to O. In fact, we develop the theory relative to a Grothendieck-style universe (minus the power-set axiom), as a way of bringing the natural and the ordinal cases under one framework. We also establish a universal property for the ordinal number system, analogous to the well-known universal property for the natural number system.
