Boolean valued models for a signature \mathcal{L} are generalizations of \mathcal{L}-structures in which we allow the \mathcal{L}-relation symbols to be interpreted by boolean truth values; for example for elements a,b\in\mathcal{M} with \mathcal{M} a \mathsf{B}-valued \mathcal{L}-structure for some boolean algebra \mathsf{B}, (a=b) may be neither true nor false, but get an intermediate truth value in \mathsf{B}. In this paper we expand and relate the work of Mansfield and others on the semantics of boolean valued models, and of Munro and others on the adjunctions between \mathsf{B}-valued models and \mathsf{B}^+-presheaves for a boolean algebra \mathsf{B}. In particular we give an exact topological characterization (the so called \emph{fullness property}) of which boolean valued models satisfy \L o\'s theorem (i.e. the general form of the forcing theorem which Cohen -- Scott, Solovay, Vopenka -- established for the special case given by the forcing method in set theory). We also give an exact categorial characterization of which presheaves correspond to \emph{full} boolean valued models in terms of the structure of global sections of their associated \'etal\'e space. To do so we introduce a slight variant of the sheafification process of a given presheaf by means of its embedding into an \'etal\'e space.
