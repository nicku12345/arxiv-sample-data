We provide the expected constructions of weakly \omega-categorified models (in the sense of Bressie) of the theory of groups and quandles which arise by replacing the homotopies used to give equivalence relations in the theory of fundamental groups, fundamental quandles, and knot quandles with homotopies of all orders used as arrows of categorical dimensions one and greater, and discuss other related constructions of weakly \omega-categorifed algebras.
