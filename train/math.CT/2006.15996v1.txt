Let A be a ring, and let M and N be A-modules. Then N can be viewed as a group object in the category A-Mod/M of A-modules over M and Ext^1(M, N) can be interpreted as the set of isomorphism classes of N-torsors. Alternatively, M can be viewed as a cogroup object in the category N/A-Mod of A-modules under N and Ext^1(M, N) can be interpreted as the set of isomorphism classes of M-cotorsors.
