We extend the formalisation of confluence results in Kleene algebras to a formalisation of coherent proofs by confluence. To this end, we introduce the structure of modal higher-dimensional globular Kleene algebra, a higher-dimensional generalisation of modal and concurrent Kleene algebra. We give a calculation of a coherent Church-Rosser theorem and Newman's lemma in higher-dimensional Kleene algebras. We interpret these results in the context of higher-dimensional rewriting systems described by polygraphs.
