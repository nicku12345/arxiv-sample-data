We construct another model structure on the category \mathrm{DblCat} of double categories and double functors, Quillen equivalent to the model structure on \mathrm{DblCat} defined in a companion paper by the authors. The weak equivalences are still given by the double biequivalences; the trivial fibrations are now the double functors that are surjective on objects, full on horizontal and vertical morphisms, and fully faithful on squares; and the fibrant objects are the weakly horizontally invariant double categories.   We show that the functor \mathbb H^{\simeq}\colon \mathrm{2Cat}\to \mathrm{DblCat}, a more homotopical version of the usual horizontal embedding \mathbb H, is right Quillen and homotopically fully faithful when considering Lack's model structure on \mathrm{2Cat}. In particular, \mathbb H^{\simeq} exhibits a fibrant replacement of \mathbb H. Moreover, Lack's model structure on \mathrm{2Cat} is right-induced along \mathbb H^{\simeq} from the model structure for weakly horizontally invariant double categories.   We also show that this model structure is monoidal with respect to B\"ohm's Gray tensor product. Finally, we prove a Whitehead Theorem characterizing the double biequivalences between the fibrant objects as the double functors which admit a pseudo inverse up to horizontal pseudo natural equivalences.
