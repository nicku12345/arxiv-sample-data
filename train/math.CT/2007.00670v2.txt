A fusion category is called transparent if the associator involving any invertible object is the identity morphism. For the Haagerup-Izumi fusion rings with G = \mathbb{Z}_{2n+1} (the \mathbb{Z}_3 case is the Haagerup fusion ring with six simple objects), the transparent ansatz reduces the number of independent F-symbols from order \mathcal{O}(n^6) to \mathcal{O}(n^2), rendering the pentagon identity practically solvable. Transparent Haagerup-Izumi categories are thereby constructively classified up to G = \mathbb{Z}_9, and further up to G = \mathbb{Z}_{15} with full tetrahedral symmetry assumed; the explicit F-symbols are compactly presented. Going beyond, the transparent ansatz offers a viable course towards producing new fusion categories for other fusion rings.
