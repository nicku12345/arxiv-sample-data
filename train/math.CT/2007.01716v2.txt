Herschend-Liu-Nakaoka introduced the notion of n-exangulated categories. It is not only a higher dimensional analogue of extriangulated categories defined by Nakaoka-Palu, but also gives a simultaneous generalization of n-exact categories and (n+2)-angulated categories. Let \mathcal C be an n-exangulated category and \mathcal X a full subcategory of \mathcal C. If \mathcal X satisfies \mathcal X\subseteq\mathcal P\cap\mathcal I, then we give a necessary and sufficient condition for the ideal quotient \mathcal C/\mathcal X to be an n-exangulated category, where \mathcal P (resp. \mathcal I) is the full subcategory of projective (resp. injective) objects in \mathcal C. In addition, we define the notion of n-proper class in \mathcal C. If \xi is an n-proper class in \mathcal C, then we prove that \mathcal C admits a new n-exangulated structure. These two ways give n-exangulated categories which are neither n-exact nor (n+2)-angulated in general.
