We study Serre structures on two types of graded k-linear categories: categories with group actions and categories with graded hom spaces. We check that Serre structures are preserved by taking orbit categories and skew group categories, and describe the relationship with graded Frobenius algebras. Using a formal version of Auslander-Reiten translations, we show that the derived category of a d-representation finite algebra is fractionally Calabi-Yau if and only if its preprojective algebra has a graded Nakayama automorphism of finite order. This connects various results in the literature and gives new examples of fractional Calabi-Yau algebras.
