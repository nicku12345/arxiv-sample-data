Extriangulated categories were introduced by Nakaoka and Palu to give a unification of properties in exact categories and extension-closed subcategories of triangulated categories. A notion of tilting pairs in an extriangulated category is introduced in this paper. We give a Bazzoni characterization of tilting pairs in this setting. We also obtain Auslander-Reiten correspondence of tilting pairs which classifies finite \mathcal{C}-tilting subcategories for a certain self-orthogonal subcategory \mathcal{C} with some assumptions. This generalizes the known results given by Wei and Xi for the categories of finitely generated modules over Artin algebras, thereby providing new insights in exact and triangulated categories.
