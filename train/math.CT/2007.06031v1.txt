We introduce the category of dependency automata. A dependency automaton consists of two nondeterministic finite automata, with a relation between their states satisfying conditions. This category is equivalent to deterministic finite automata interpreted in join-semilattices i.e. JSL-dfas. The canonical dependency automaton accepting L amounts to the state-minimal dfas for L and rev(L) connected by the `dependency relation'.   We describe many canonical JSL-dfas as dependency automata and also explain/extend Brzozowski's algorithm. Call an nfa `subatomic' if its individual states accept a language in the closure of \{L\} under left/right quotients and set-theoretic boolean operations. We prove an nfa N is subatomic iff rsc(rev(N))'s transition monoid is syntactic.
