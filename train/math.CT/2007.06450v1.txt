Let \mathcal B be an extriangulated category with enough projectives \mathcal P and enough injectives \mathcal I, and let \mathcal R be a contravariantly finite rigid subcategory of \mathcal B which contains \mathcal P. We have an abelian quotient category \mathcal H/\mathcal R\subseteq \mathcal B/\mathcal R which is equivalent {\rm mod}(\mathcal R/\mathcal P). In this article, we find a one-to-one correspondence between support \tau-tilting (resp. \tau-rigid) subcategories of \mathcal H/\mathcal R and maximal relative rigid (resp. relative rigid) subcategories of \mathcal H, and show that support tilting subcategories in \mathcal H/\mathcal R is a special kind of support \tau-tilting subcategories. We also study the relation between tilting subcategories of \mathcal B/\mathcal R and cluster tilting subcategories of \mathcal B when \mathcal R is cluster tilting.
