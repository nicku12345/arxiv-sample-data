We introduce (dual) relative CS-Rickart objects in abelian categories, as common generalizations of (dual) relative Rickart objects and extending (lifting) objects. We study direct summands and (co)products of (dual) relative CS-Rickart objects as well as classes all of whose objects are (dual) self-CS-Rickart. Applications are given to Grothendieck categories and, in particular, to module and comodule categories.
