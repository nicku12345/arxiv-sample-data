Based on our previous work on an arithmetic analogue of Christol's theorem, this paper studies in more detail the structure of the lambda-ring E_K = K \otimes W_{O_K}^a (O_{\bar{K}}) of algebraic Witt vectors for number fields K. First developing general results concerning E_K, we apply them to the case when K is an imaginary quadratic field. The main results include the "modularity theorem" for algebraic Witt vectors, which claims that certain deformation families f: M_2(\widehat{\mathbb{Z}}) \times \mathfrak{H} \rightarrow \mathbb{C} of modular functions of finite level always define algebraic Witt vectors \widehat{f} by their special values, and conversely, every algebraic Witt vector \xi \in E_K is realized in this way, that is, \xi = \widehat{f} for some deformation family f: M_2(\widehat{\mathbb{Z}}) \times \mathfrak{H} \rightarrow \mathbb{C}. This gives a rather explicit description of the lambda-ring E_K for imaginary quadratic fields K, which is stated as the identity E_K=M_K between the lambda-ring E_K and the K-algebra M_K of modular vectors \widehat{f}.
