This paper presents the basic concepts of a systemic theory of interaction between non-deterministic open dynamics with varying temporalities, which includes three stages: the definition of these dynamics as lax-functors, the notion of interaction -- which uses some notions of requests, synchronizations and social modes (privacy) -- and finally the generation of open global dynamics. Some connectivity structures of an interaction are defined, but the other aspects of dynamical connectivity are left to further work.
