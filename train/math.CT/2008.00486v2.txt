For a variety \mathcal{V}, it has been recently shown that binary products commute with arbitrary coequalizers locally, i.e., in every fibre of the fibration of points \pi: \mathrm{Pt} (\mathbb{C}) \rightarrow \mathbb{C}, if and only if Gumm's shifting lemma holds on pullbacks in \mathcal{V}. In this paper, we establish a similar result connecting the so-called triangular lemma in universal algebra with a certain categorical \textit{anticommutativity} condition. In particular, we show that this anticommutativity and its local version are Mal'tsev conditions, the local version being equivalent to the triangular lemma on pullbacks. As a corollary, every locally anticommutative variety \mathcal{V} has directly decomposable congruence classes in the sense of Duda, and the converse holds if \mathcal{V} is idempotent.
