In this paper, we discuss the generalization of finitary 2-representation theory of finitary 2-categories to finitary birepresentation theory of finitary bicategories. In previous papers on the subject, the classification of simple transitive 2-representations of a given 2-category was reduced to that for certain subquotients. These reduction results were all formulated as bijections between equivalence classes of 2-representations. In this paper, we generalize them to biequivalences between certain 2-categories of birepresentations. Furthermore, we prove an analog of the double centralizer theorem in finitary birepresentation theory.
