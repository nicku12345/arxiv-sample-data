The stable module category of a selfinjective algebra is triangulated, but need not have any nontrivial t-structures, and in particular, full abelian subcategories need not arise as hearts of a t-structure. The purpose of this paper is to investigate full abelian subcategories of triangulated categories whose exact structures are related, and more precisely, to explore relations between invariants of finite-dimensional selfinjective algebras and full abelian subcategories of their stable module categories.
