A reflective subuniverse in homotopy type theory is an internal version of the notion of a localization in topology or in the theory of \infty-categories. We give new characterizations of the following conditions on a reflective subuniverse L: (1) the associated subuniverse L' of L-separated types is a modality; (2) L is a modality; (3) L is a lex modality; and (4) L is a cotopological modality. Our characterizations involve various families of maps associated to L, such as the L-\'etale maps, the L-equivalences, the L-local maps, the L-connected maps, the unit maps \eta_X, and their left and/or right orthogonal complements.
