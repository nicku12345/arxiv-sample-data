This is an introduction to the study of abstract homotopy theory by means of model categories and (\infty,1)-categories. The only prerequisites are very basic general topology and abstract algebra. None categorical background is needed. The final objective is to show that classical homotopy theory for topological spaces can be more naturally understood in terms of categorical language.
