We give diagrammatic tools to reason about information flow within encrypted communication. In particular, we are interested in deducing where information flow (communication or otherwise) has taken place, and fully accounting for all possible paths. The core mathematical concept is using a single categorical diagram to model the underlying mathematics, the epistemic knowledge of the participants, and (implicitly) the potential or actual communication between participants. A key part of this is a `correctness' or `consistency' criterion that ensures we accurately & fully account for the distinct routes by which information may come to be known (i.e. communication and / or calculation). We demonstrate how this formalism may be applied to answer questions about communication scenarios where we have the partial information about the participants and their interactions. Similarly, we show how to analyse the consequences of changes to protocols or communications, and to enumerate the distinct orders in which events may have occurred. We use various forms of Diffie-Hellman key exchange as an illustration of these techniques. However, they are entirely general; we illustrate in an appendix how other protocols from non-commutative cryptography may be analysed in the same manner.
