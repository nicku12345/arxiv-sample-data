We develop the theory of k-idempotent ideals in the setting of dualizing varieties and we extend several results given by Auslander-Platzeck-Todorov. Given an ideal \mathcal{I}, which is the trace of a projective module, we construct a canonical recollement, which is the analogous of a well known recollement in module categories over artin algebras. We study homological properties of the categories involved in such recollement and we find conditions on the ideal \mathcal{I} in order to obtain quasi-hereditary algebras in the recollement. Finally, we give an application to bounded derived categories.
