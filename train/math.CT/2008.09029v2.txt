Consider a collection of vector subspaces of a given vector space and a collection of projectors on these vector spaces, can we decompose the vector space into a product of vector subspaces such that the projectors are isomorphic to projections? We provide an answer to this question by extending the relation between the intersection property and the interaction decomposition (done in the injective case) to the projective case. This enables us to classify the decompositions of interactions for factor spaces. We then extend these results for presheaves from a poset to the category of modules by adding the data of a section functor when it exists.
