In this survey paper, we present \v{C}ech and sheaf cohomologies -- themes that were presented by Koszul in University of S\~ao Paulo during his visit in the late 1950s -- we present expansions for categories of generalized sheaves (i.e, Grothendieck toposes), with examples of applications in other cohomology theories and other areas of mathematics, besides providing motivations and historical notes. We conclude explaining the difficulties in establishing a cohomology theory for elementary toposes, presenting alternative approaches by considering constructions over quantales, that provide structures similar to sheaves, and indicating researches related to logic: constructive (intuitionistic and linear) logic for toposes, sheaves over quantales, and homological algebra.
