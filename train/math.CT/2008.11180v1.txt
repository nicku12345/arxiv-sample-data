Weakly globular double categories are a model of weak 2-categories based on the notion of weak globularity, and they are known to be suitably equivalent to Tamsamani 2-categories. Fair 2-categories, introduced by J. Kock, model weak 2-categories with strictly associative compositions and weak unit laws. In this paper we establish a direct comparison between weakly globular double categories and fair 2-categories and prove they are equivalent after localisation with respect to the 2-equivalences. This comparison sheds new light on weakly globular double categories as encoding a strictly associative, though not strictly unital, composition, as well as the category of weak units via the weak globularity condition.
