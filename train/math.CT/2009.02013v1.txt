We prove that the bounded derived category of coherent sheaves on a quasicompact separated quasiexcellent scheme of finite dimension has a strong generator in the sense of Bondal-Van den Bergh. This extends a recent result of Neeman and is new even in the affine case. The main ingredient includes Gabber's weak local uniformization theorem and the notions of boundedness and descendability of a morphism of schemes.
