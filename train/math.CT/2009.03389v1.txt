We consider flat epimorphisms of commutative rings R\to U such that, for every ideal I\subset R for which IU=U, the quotient ring R/I is semilocal of Krull dimension zero. Under these assumptions, we show that the projective dimension of the R-module U does not exceed 1. We also describe the Geigle-Lenzing perpendicular subcategory U^{\perp_{0,1}} in R\mathsf{-Mod}. Assuming additionally that the ring U and all the rings R/I are perfect, we show that all flat R-modules are U-strongly flat. Thus we obtain a generalization of some results of the paper arXiv:1801.04820, where the case of the localization U=S^{-1}R of the ring R at a multiplicative subset S\subset R was considered.
