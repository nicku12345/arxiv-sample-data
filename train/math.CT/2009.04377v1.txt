We adjust the notion of finitary filter pair, which was coined for creating and analyzing finitary logics, in such a way that we can treat logics of cardinality \kappa, {where \k is a regular cardinal}. The corresponding new notion is called \kappa-filter pair. We show that any \kappa-filter pair gives rise to a logic of cardinality \kappa and that every logic of cardinality \kappa comes from a \kappa-filter pair. We use filter pairs to construct natural extensions for a given logic and work out the relationships between this construction and several others proposed in the literature. Conversely, we describe the class of filter pairs giving rise to a fixed logic in terms of the natural extensions of that logic.
