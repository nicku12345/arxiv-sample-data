In [Homotopical Algebra, Springer LNM 43] Quillen introduces the notion of a model category: a category \mathcal{C} provided with three distinguished classes of maps \{\mathcal{W},\, \mathcal{F},\, co\mathcal{F}\} (weak equivalences, fibrations, cofibrations), and gives a construction of the localization \mathcal{C}[\mathcal{W}^{-1}] as the quotient of \mathcal{C} by the congruence relation determined by the homotopies on the sets of arrows \mathcal{C}(X,\,Y). We develop here the 2-categorical localization, in which the 2-cells of this 2-localization are given by homotopies, and one can get the Quillen's localization when applying the connected components functor \pi_0 on the hom-categories of the 2-localization. Our proof is not just a generalization of the well-known Quillen's one. We work with definitions of cylinders and homotopies introduced in [M.E. Descotte, E.J. Dubuc, M. Szyld; Model bicategories and their homotopy bicategories, arXiv:1805.07749 (2018)] considering only a single family of arrows \Sigma. When \Sigma is the class \mathcal{W} of weak equivalences of a model category, we get the Quillen's results.
