We introduce a functor \mathcal V\colon\textsf{DblCat}_{\mathrm{h,nps}}\to \textsf{2Cat}_{\mathrm{h,nps}} extracting from a double category a 2-category whose objects and morphisms are the vertical morphisms and squares. We give a characterisation of bi-representations of a normal pseudo-functor F\colon \mathbf C^{\operatorname{op}}\to \textsf{Cat} in terms of double bi-initial objects in the double category \mathbb{E}\operatorname{l}(F) of elements of F, or equivalently as bi-initial objects of a special form in the 2-category \mathcal V\mathbb{E}\operatorname{l}(F) of morphisms of F. Although not true in general, in the special case where the 2-category \mathbf C has tensors by the category \{0\to 1\} and F preserves those tensors, we show that a bi-representation of F is then precisely a bi-initial object in the 2-category \mathbf{El}(F) of elements of F. We give applications of this theory to bi-adjunctions and weighted bi-limits.
