Given an \infty-bicategory \mathbb{D} with underlying \infty-category \mathcal{D}, we construct a Cartesian fibration \operatorname{Tw}(\mathbb{D})\to \mathcal{D} \times \mathcal{D}^{\operatorname{op}}, which we call the enhanced twisted arrow \infty-category, classifying the restricted mapping category functor \operatorname{Map}_{\mathbb{D}}:\mathcal{D}^{\operatorname{op}}\times \mathcal{D} \to \mathbb{D}^{\operatorname{op}} \times \mathbb{D} \to \operatorname{Cat}_{\infty}. With the aid of this new construction, we provide a description of the \infty-category of natural transformations \operatorname{Nat}(F,G) as an end for any functors F and G from an \infty-category to an \infty-bicategory. As an application of our results, we demonstrate that the definition of weighted colimits presented in arXiv:1501.02161 satisfies the expected 2-dimensional universal property.
