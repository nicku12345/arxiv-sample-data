In this paper, the categorial property of compactness of an object, i. e. commuting of the corresponding \Hom functor with coproducts, is studied in categories of S-acts and the corresponding structural properties of compact S-acts are shown. In order to establish a general context and to unify the approach to both of the most important categories of S-acts, the notion of a concrete category with unique decomposition of objects is introduced and studied.
