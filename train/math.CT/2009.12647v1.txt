System of systems engineering seeks to analyze, design and deploy collections of systems that together can flexibly address an array of complex tasks. In the Complex Adaptive System Composition and Design Environment program, we developed "network operads" as a tool for designing and tasking systems of systems, and applied them to domains including maritime search and rescue. The network operad formalism offers new ways to handle changing levels of abstraction in system-of-system design and tasking.
