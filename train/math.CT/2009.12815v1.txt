Skew braces have recently attracted attention as a method to study set-theoretical solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation. Here, we present a new approach to these solutions by studying Hopf algebras in the category, \mathrm{SupLat}, of complete lattices and join-preserving morphisms. We connect the two methods by showing that any Hopf algebra, \mathcal{H} in \mathrm{SupLat}, has a corresponding group, R(\mathcal{H}), which we call its remnant and a co-quasitriangular structure on \mathcal{H} induces a YBE solution on R(\mathcal{H}), which is compatible with its group structure. Conversely, any group with a compatible YBE solution can be realised in this way. Additionally, it is well-known that any such group has an induced secondary group structure, making it a skew left brace. By realising the group as the remnant of a co-quasitriangular Hopf algebra, \mathcal{H}, this secondary group structure appears as the projection of the transmutation of \mathcal{H}. Finally, for any YBE solution, we obtain a FRT-type Hopf algebra in \mathrm{SupLat}, whose remnant recovers the universal skew brace of the solution.
