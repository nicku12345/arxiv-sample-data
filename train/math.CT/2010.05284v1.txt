We revisit results concerning the connection between subspaces of a space and sublocales of its locale of open sets. The approach we present is based on the observation that for every locale L its spatial sublocales \mathsf{sp}[\mathsf{S}(L)] form a coframe which is isomorphic to the coframe \mathsf{sob}[\mathcal{P}(\mathsf{pt}(L))] of sober subspaces of \mathsf{pt}(L). We characterize the frames L such that the spatial sublocales of \mathsf{S}(L) perfectly represent the subspaces of \mathsf{pt}(L). We prove choice-free, weak versions of the results by Niefield and Rosenthal characterizing those frames such that all their sublocales are spatial (i.e., those such that the sober subspaces of \mathsf{pt}(L) perfectly represent the sublocales of L). We do so by using a notion of essential prime which does not rely on the existence of enough minimal primes above every element. We will re-prove Simmons' result that spaces such that the sublocales of \Omega (X) perfectly represent their subspaces are exactly the scattered spaces. We will characterize scattered spaces in terms of a strong form of essentiality for primes. We apply these characterizations to show that, when L is a spatial frame and a coframe, \mathsf{pt}(L) is scattered if and only if it is T_D, and this holds if and only if all the primes of L are completely prime.
