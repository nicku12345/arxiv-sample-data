In this paper, we study ICE-closed (= Image-Cokernel-Extension-closed) subcategories of an abelian length category using torsion classes. To each interval [\mathcal{U},\mathcal{T}] in the lattice of torsion classes, we associate a subcategory \mathcal{T} \cap \mathcal{U}^\perp called the heart. We show that every ICE-closed subcategory can be realized as a heart of some interval of torsion classes, and give a lattice-theoretic characterization of intervals whose hearts are ICE-closed. In particular, we prove that ICE-closed subcategories are precisely torsion classes in some wide subcategories. For an artin algebra, we introduce the notion of wide \tau-tilting modules as a generalization of support \tau-tilting modules. Then we establish a bijection between wide \tau-tilting modules and ICE-closed subcategories satisfying certain finiteness conditions, which extends Adachi-Iyama-Reiten's bijection on torsion classes. Furthermore, we discuss the Hasse quiver of the poset of ICE-closed subcategories for the hereditary case by introducing a mutation of rigid modules.
