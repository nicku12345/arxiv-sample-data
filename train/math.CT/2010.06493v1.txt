This paper is concerned with the nonabelian cohomology of groups with coefficients in crossed modules. These objects were introduced by Dedecker and studied by Breen, Borovoi, Noohi and many others. In this paper we study several important objects that are classified by these cohomologies and for them we develop a theory similar to the Schreier obstruction theory of group extensions.
