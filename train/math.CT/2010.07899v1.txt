We introduce three general compositionality criteria over operational semantics that guarantee weak bisimulation being a congruence. Our work is founded upon Turi and Plotkin's mathematical operational semantics and the coalgebraic approach to weak bisimulation by Brengos. We demonstrate each criterion with various examples of success and failure and give a formal proof of correctness for our main result.
