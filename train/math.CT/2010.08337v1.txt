This paper introduces an approach to constructing ledger structures for cryptocurrency systems with basic category theory. Compositional theories of resource convertibility allow us to express the material history of virtual goods, and ownership is modelled by a free construction. Our notion of ownership admits an intuitive graphical representation through string diagrams for monoidal functors.
