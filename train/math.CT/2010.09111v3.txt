We contribute to the knowledge of the quantifier completions and their applications by using the language of doctrines. This algebraic presentation allows us to properly analyse the behaviour of the existential and universal quantifiers. We wish to convey the following points: the first is that these completions preserve the lattice structure and the distributive lattice structure of the fibres under opportune hypotheses which turn out to be preserved as well; the second regards the applications, in particular to the dialectica construction; the third is that these free constructions carry on some relevant choice principles.
