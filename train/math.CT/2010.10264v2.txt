This paper classifies Grothendieck rings of complex fusion categories of multiplicity one up to rank six, as an application of a localization approach of the Pentagon Equation and some new criteria, developed by the authors. Exactly 47 among 72 fusion rings are categorifiable over C, all unitarily. We have found 6 new Grothendieck rings.
