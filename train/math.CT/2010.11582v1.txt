The notion of an upward plane graph in graph theory and that of a progressive plane graph (or plane string diagram) in category theory are essentially the same thing. In this paper, we combine the ideas in graph theory and category theory to explain why and in what sense upward planarity is a topological property. The main result is that two upward planar drawings of an acyclic directed graph are equivalent (connected by a deformation) if and only if they are connected by a planar isotopy which preserves the orientation and polarization of G. This result gives a positive answer to Selinger's conjectue, whose strategy is different from the solution recently given by Delpeuch and Vicary.
