We prove that the 2-category of skeletally small abelian categories with exact monoidal structures is anti-equivalent to the 2-category of fp-hom-closed definable additive categories satisfying an exactness criterion. For a fixed finitely accessible category \mathcal{C} with products and a monoidal structure satisfying the appropriate assumptions, we provide bijections between the fp-hom-closed definable subcategories of \mathcal{C}, the Serre tensor-ideals of \mathcal{C}^{\mathrm{fp}}\hbox{-}\mathrm{mod} and the closed subsets of a Ziegler-type topology. For a skeletally small preadditive category \mathcal{A} with an additive, symmetric, rigid monoidal structure we show that elementary duality induces a bijection between the fp-hom-closed definable subcategories of \mathrm{Mod}\hbox{-}\mathcal{A} and the definable tensor-ideals of \mathcal{A}\hbox{-}\mathrm{Mod}.
