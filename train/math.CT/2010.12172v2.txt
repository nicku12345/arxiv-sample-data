The paper concerns the Gelfand-Kirillov dimension and the generating series of nonsymmetric operads. An analogue of Bergman's gap theorem is proved, namely, no finitely generated locally finite nonsymmetric operad has Gelfand-Kirillov dimension strictly between 1 and 2. For every r\in \{0\}\cup \{1\}\cup [2,\infty) or r=\infty, we construct a single-element generated nonsymmetric operad with Gelfand-Kirillov dimension r. We also provide counterexamples to two expectations of Khoroshkin and Piontkovski about the generating series of operads.
