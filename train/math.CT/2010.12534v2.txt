Diagram chasing is a customary proof method used in category theory and homological algebra. It involves an element-theoretic approach to show that certain properties hold for a commutative diagram. When dealing with abelian categories for the first time, one would work using a diagrammatic approach without relying on the notion of elements. However, constantly manipulating universal properties of various diagrams can be quite cumbersome. That said, we believe that it is still important to draw a contrast between both viewpoints in order to motivate the field of category theory. We focus our scope to the short five lemma, one of the more elementary diagram lemmas, and present a quick exposition on relevant subjects. Moreover, we give an original proof of the short five lemma using the universal property of pullbacks.
