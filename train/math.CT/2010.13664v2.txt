A reparametrization category is a small topologically enriched symmetric semimonoidal category such that the semimonoidal structure induces a structure of a commutative semigroup on objects, such that all spaces of maps are contractible and such that each map can be decomposed (not necessarily in a unique way) as a tensor product of two maps. A Moore flow is a small semicategory enriched over the closed semimonoidal category of enriched presheaves over a reparametrization category. We construct the q-model category of Moore flows. It is proved that it is Quillen equivalent to the q-model category of flows. This result is the first step to establish a zig-zag of Quillen equivalences between the q-model structure of multipointed d-spaces and the q-model structure of flows.
