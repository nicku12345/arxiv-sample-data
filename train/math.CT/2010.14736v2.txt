We give a structure theorem for Calabi-Yau triangulated category with a hereditary cluster tilting object. We prove that an algebraic d-Calabi-Yau triangulated category with a d-cluster tilting object T such that its shifted sum T\oplus\cdots\oplus T[-(d-2)] has hereditary endomorphism algebra H is triangle equivalent to the orbit category \mathscr{D}^b(\mathrm{\mathop{mod}}\, H)/\tau^{-1/(d-1)}[1] of the derived category of H for a naturally defined (d-1)-st root \tau^{1/(d-1)} of the AR translation, provided H is of non-Dynkin type. We also show that hereditaryness of H follows from that of T is when d=3, that of T\oplus T[-1] when d=4, and similarly from a smaller endomorphism algebra for higher dimensions under vanishing of some negative self-extensions of T. Our result therefore generalizes the established theorems by Keller--Reiten and Keller--Murfet--Van den Bergh. Furthermore, we show that enhancements of such triangulated categories are unique. Finally we apply our results to Calabi-Yau reductions of a higher cluster category of a finite dimensional algebra and of the singularity category of an invariant subring.
