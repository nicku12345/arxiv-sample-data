We identify simple universal properties that uniquely characterize the Lebesgue L^p spaces. There are two main theorems. The first states that the Banach space L^p[0, 1], equipped with a small amount of extra structure, is initial as such. The second states that the L^p functor on finite measure spaces, again with some extra structure, is also initial as such. In both cases, the universal characterization of the integrable functions produces a unique characterization of integration. Using the universal properties, we develop some of the basic elements of integration theory. We also state universal properties characterizing the sequence spaces \ell^p and c_0, as well as the functor L^2 taking values in Hilbert spaces.
