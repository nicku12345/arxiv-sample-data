Herschend-Liu-Nakaoka introduced the notion of n-exangulated categories. It is not only a higher dimensional analogue of extriangulated categories defined by Nakaoka-Palu, but also gives a simultaneous generalization of (n+2)-angulated in the sense of Geiss-Keller-Oppermann and n-exact categories in the sense of Jasso. In this article, we show that an n-exangulated category has the structure of an (n+2)-angulated category if and only if for any object X in the category, the morphism 0\to X is a trivial deflation and the morphism X\to 0 is a trivial inflation.
