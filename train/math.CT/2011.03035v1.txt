We define for each n \geq 1 a symmetric monoidal (\infty, n+1)-category n\mathrm{Pr}^L whose objects we call presentable (\infty,n)-categories, generalizing the usual theory of presentable (\infty,1)-categories. We show that each object \mathcal{C} in n\mathrm{Pr}^L has an underlying (\infty,n)-category \psi_n(\mathcal{C}) which admits all conical colimits, and that conical colimits of right adjointable diagrams in \psi_n(\mathcal{C}) can be computed in terms of conical limits after passage to right adjoints.
