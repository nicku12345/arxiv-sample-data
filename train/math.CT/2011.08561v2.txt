We consider two preorder-enriched categories of ordered PCAs: \mathsf{OPCA}, where the arrows are functional morphisms, and \mathsf{PCA}, where the arrows are applicative morphisms. We show that \mathsf{OPCA} has small products and finite biproducts, and that \mathsf{PCA} has finite coproducts, all in a suitable 2-categorical sense. On the other hand, \mathsf{PCA} lacks all nontrivial binary products. We deduce from this that the pushout, over \mathsf{Set}, of two nontrivial realizability toposes is never a realizability topos.
