The notion of \emph{D-sublocale} is explored. This is the notion analogue to that of sublocale in the duality of T_Dspaces. A sublocale S of a frame L is a D-sublocale if and only if the corresponding localic map preserves the property of being a covered prime. It is shown that for a frame L the system of those sublocales which are also D-sublocales form a dense sublocale \mathsf{S}_D(L) of the coframe \mathsf{S}(L) of all its sublocales. It is also shown that the spatialization \mathsf{sp}_D[\mathsf{S}_D(L)] of \mathsf{S}_D(L) consists precisely of those D-sublocales of L which are T_D-spatial. Additionally, frames such that we have \mathsf{S}_D(L)\cong \mathcal{P}(\mathsf{pt}_D(L)) -- that is, those such that D-sublocales perfectly represent subspaces -- are characterized as those T_D-spatial frames such that \mathsf{S}_D(L) is the Booleanization of \mathsf{S}(L).
