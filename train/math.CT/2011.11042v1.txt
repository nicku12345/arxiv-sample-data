We study various types of fibrations over a product of two \infty-categories, and show how they can be dualised over one of the two factors via an explicit construction in terms of spans. Among other things, we use this to prove that given an adjunction between monoidal \infty-categories, there is an equivalence between lax monoidal structures on the right adjoint and oplax monoidal structures on the left adjoint functor.
