The aim of this paper is to study the points and localising subcategories of the topos of M-sets, for a finite monoid M. We show that the points of this topos can be fully classified using the idempotents of M. We introduce a topology on the iso-classes of these points, which differs from the classical topology introduced in SGA4. Likewise, the localised subcategories of the topos M-sets correspond to the set of all two-sided idempotent Ideals of M.
