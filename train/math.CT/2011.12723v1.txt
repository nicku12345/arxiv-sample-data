Every (\infty, n)-category can be approximated by its tower of homotopy (m, n)-categories. In this paper, we prove that the successive stages of this tower are classified by k-invariants, analogously to the classical Postnikov tower for spaces. Our proof relies on an abstract analysis of Postnikov-type towers equipped with k-invariants, and also yields a construction of k-invariants for algebras over \infty-operads and enriched \infty-categories.
