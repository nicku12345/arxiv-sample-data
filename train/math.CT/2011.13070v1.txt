As the prototypical category, \mathbf{Set} has many properties which make it special amongst categories. From the point of view of mathematical logic, one such property is that \mathbf{Set} has enough structure to "properly" formalise logic. However, we could ask what it might mean to formalise logic in another category \mathbf{C}. The notion of an (elementary) topos distills the essential features of \mathbf{Set} which allow us to do this. This expository report defines topoi, and describes the development of first-order logic and set theory within a topos.
