It is well known that classical varieties of \Sigma-algebras correspond bijectively to finitary monads on \mathsf{Set}. We present an analogous result for varieties of ordered \Sigma-algebras, i.e., classes presented by inequations between \Sigma-terms. We prove that they correspond bijectively to strongly finitary monads on \mathsf{Pos}. That is, those finitary monads which preserve reflexive coinserters. We deduce that strongly finitary monads have a coinserter presentation, analogous to the coequaliser presentation of finitary monads due to Kelly and Power. We also show that these monads are liftings of finitary monads on \mathsf{Set}.
