The equivalence of formal languages with categories has long been expounded, notably by [10.1007/BFb0066201], relating coherent categories with predicate logic, where coherent functors serve as translations between predicate theories. This equivalence yielded remarkable results connecting syntax to semantics, but the formalism relied upon category theory. Work by [arXiv:1506.04675,arxiv:1507.02302,10.1017/9781316275603] proposed syntactical notions of equivalence and translation of theories. In this paper, we demonstrate that these syntactical notions are equivalent to the categorical formalism, allowing us to present Makkai and Reyes' conceptual completeness of coherent logic in a syntactical form and to explain and remove the required hypotheses of the translations in [10.1017/9781316275603]. Our equivalence elucidates the relation between categorical equivalence and Morita equivalence, and it reveals necessary and sufficient conditions for when a theory is intertranslatable with or Morita equivalent to a propositional theory.
