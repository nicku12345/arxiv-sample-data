We take advantage of the recent description of Morita equivalence for inverse quantal frames in terms of biprincipal bisheaves to define Morita equivalence for pseudogroups and to investigate its applications. In particular, we prove that two such pseudogroups are Morita equivalent if and only if their corresponding localic \'etale groupoids are. We explore the clear analogies between our definition of Morita equivalence for pseudogroups and the usual notion of strong Morita equivalence for C^{\ast}-algebras and these lead to a number of concrete results.
