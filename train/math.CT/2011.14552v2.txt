This paper mainly studies the relative Gorenstein objects in the extriangulated category \mathcal{C}=(\mathcal{C},\mathbb{E},\mathfrak{s}) with a proper class \xi and the related properties of these objects.   In the first part, we define the notion of the \xi-\mathcal{G}projective resolution, and study the relation between \xi-projective resolution and \xi-\mathcal{G}projective resolution for any object A in \mathcal{C}, i.e. A has a \mathcal{C}(-,\mathcal{P}(\xi))-exact \xi-projective resolution if and only if A has a \mathcal{C}(-,\mathcal{P}(\xi))-exact \xi-\mathcal{G}projective resolution.   In the second part, we define a particular \xi-Gorenstein projective object in \mathcal{C} which called \xi-n-strongly \mathcal{G}projective object. On this basis, we study the relation between \xi-m-strongly \mathcal{G}projective object and \xi-n-strongly \mathcal{G}projective object whenever m\neq n, and give some equivalent characterizations of \xi-n-strongly \mathcal{G}projective objects.
