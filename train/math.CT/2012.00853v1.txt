Diers developed a general theory of right multiadjoint functors leading to a purely cate-gorical, point-set construction of spectra. Situations of multiversal properties return sets ofcanonical solutions rather than a unique one. In the case of a right multiadjoint, each objectdeploys a canonical cone of local units jointly assuming the role of the unit of an adjunction.This first part revolves around the theory of multiadjoint and recalls or precises results thatwill be used later on for geometric purpose. We also study the weaker notion of local adjoint,proving Beck-Chevaley conditions relating local adjunctions and the equivalence with the no-tion of stable functor. We also recall the link with the free-product completion, and describefactorization aspects involved in a situation of multi-adjunction.
