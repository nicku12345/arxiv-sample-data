Category theory has been recently used as a tool for constructing and modeling an information flow framework. Here, we use the theory of preradicals to show that the flow of information can be described using preradicals and its properties. We show that preradicals generalize the notion of persistence to spaces where the underlying structure forms a directed acyclic graph. We prove that the persistence module associated with a directed acyclic graph can be obtained by a particular {\alpha} preradical. Given how preradicals are defined, they can be considered as compatible choice assignments that preserve the underlying structure of the modeled system. This drives us to generalize the notions of standard persistence, zigzag persistence, and multidirectional persistence.
