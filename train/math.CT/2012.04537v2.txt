We study four types of (co)cartesian fibrations of \infty-bicategories over a given base \mathcal{B}, and prove that they encode the four variance flavors of \mathcal{B}-indexed diagrams of \infty-categories. We then use this machinery to set up a general theory of 2-(co)limits for diagrams valued in an \infty-bicategory, capable of expressing lax, weighted and pseudo limits. When the \infty-bicategory at hand arises from a model category tensored over marked simplicial sets, we show that this notion of 2-(co)limit can be calculated as a suitable form of a weighted homotopy limit on the model categorical level, thus showing in particular the existence of these 2-(co)limits in a wide range of examples. We finish by discussing a notion of cofinality appropriate to this setting and use it to deduce the unicity of 2-(co)limits, once exist.
