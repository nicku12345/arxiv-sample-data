In a recent paper, a realizability technique has been used to give a semantics of a quantum lambda calculus. Such a technique gives rise to an infinite number of valid typing rules, without giving preference to any subset of those. In this paper, we introduce a valid subset of typing rules, defining an expressive enough quantum calculus. Then, we propose a categorical semantics for it. Such a semantics consists of an adjunction between the category of semi-vector spaces of value distributions (that is, linear combinations of values in the lambda calculus), and the category of sets of value distributions.
