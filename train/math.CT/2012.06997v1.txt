Let \mathcal B be an extriangulated category with enough projectives and enough injectives. We define a proper m-term subcategory \mathcal G on \mathcal B, which is an extriangulated subcategory. Then we give a correspondence between cotorsion pairs on \mathcal G, support \tau-tilting subcategories on an abelian quotient of \mathcal G when m=2. If such \mathcal G is induced by a hereditary cotorsion pair, then we give a correspondence between cotorsion pairs on \mathcal G and intermediate cotorsion pairs on \mathcal B under certain assumptions. At last, we study an important property of such extriangulated subcategory \mathcal G.
