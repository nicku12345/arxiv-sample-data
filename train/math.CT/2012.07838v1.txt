Let C be an additive category with cokernels and let Mod(C) be the category of additive functors from C^{op} to the category Ab of abelian groups. Let mod(C) be the full subcategory of Mod(C) consisting of coherent functors. In this paper, we first study some basic properties of pseudo-kernel of morphisms in C. When C has pseudo-kernels, mod(C) is abelian and then, in this case, we study radical functors, half exact functors, left exact functors and injective objects in mod(C). At last, we extend the results for Mod(C).
