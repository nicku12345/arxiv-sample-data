This book provides an inviting tour through sheaf theory, from the perspective of applied category theory and pitched at a less specialized audience than is typical with introductions to sheaves. The book makes it as easy as possible for the reader new to sheaves, by motivating and developing the theory via a broad range of concrete examples and explicit constructions, including applications to n-colorings of graphs, satellite data, chess problems, Bayes nets, musical performance, complexes, and more. Included is an extended first chapter introducing and motivating all the necessary category-theoretical background, again with a strong emphasis on concrete examples.   A new and unabridged version (including a fifth chapter on more advanced topics and a conclusion) will be available with MIT Press.
