We develop universal algebra over an enriched category \mathcal K and relate it to finitary enriched monads over \mathcal K. Using it, we deduce recent results about ordered universal algebra where inequations are used instead of equations. Then we apply it to metric universal algebra where quantitative equations are used instead of equations. This contributes to understanding of finitary monads on the category of metric spaces.
