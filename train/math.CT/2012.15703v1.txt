We consider essentially small rigid tensor categories (not necessarily abelian) which have a faithful tensor functor to a category of super vector spaces over a field of characteristic 0. It is shown how to construct for each such tensor category a super Tannakian hull, which is a universal faithful tensor functor to a super Tannakian category over a field of characteristic 0. The construction is analogous to the passage from an integral domain to its field of fractions.
