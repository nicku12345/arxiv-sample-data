Shuffle operads were introduced to make explicit the actions of symmetric groups on symmetric operads. Rewriting methods were then applied to symmetric operads via shuffle operads: in particular, a notion of Gr\"obner basis was introduced for shuffle operads with respect to a total order on tree monomials. In this article, we introduce the structure of shuffle polygraphs as a general framework for rewriting in shuffle operads, which generalizes the Gr\"obner bases approach by removing the constraint of a monomial order for the orientation of the rewriting rules. We define omega-operads as internal omega-categories in the category of shuffle operads. We show how to extend a convergent shuffle polygraph into a shuffle polygraphic resolution generated by the overlapping branchings of the original polygraph. Finally, we prove that a shuffle operad presented by a quadratic convergent shuffle polygraph is Koszul.
