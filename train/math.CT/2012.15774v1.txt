The 3-categories of semisimple 2-categories and of multifusion categories are shown to be equivalent. A weakening of the notion of fusion 2-category is introduced. Multifusion 2-categories are defined, and the fusion rule of the fusion 2-categories associated to certain pointed braided fusion categories is described.
