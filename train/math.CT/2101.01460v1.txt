This is the second paper that completes the series started by \cite{Fem}. In the former, we constructed a tricategory \DblPs of double categories and announced the notion of categories internal in tricategories of the type of \DblPs, as alternative to the notion of intercategories of Grandis and Par\'e, so that monoids from \cite{Gabi} fit as their particular case. We complete this project in the current paper and show that weak pseudomonoids in a tricategory which has B\"ohm's monoidal category as the underlying 1-category are internal categories in \DblPs. Moreover, we prove that categories enriched over certain type of tricategories may be made categories internal in them, and show how the tricategory of tensor categories is an example of this over the ambient tricategory 2\x\Cat_{wk} of 2-categories, pseudofunctors, pseudonatural transformations and modifications.
