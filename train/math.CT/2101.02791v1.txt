We propose a definition of higher sheaf with respect to an arbitrary set of maps \Sigma in an \infty-topos \mathcal{E}. We then show that the associated reflection \mathcal{E} \to {\rm Sh}(\mathcal{E},\Sigma) is left-exact so that the subcategory of sheaves with respect to \Sigma is itself an \infty-topos. Furthermore, we show that the reflection \mathcal{E} \to {\rm Sh}(\mathcal{E},\Sigma) may be characterized as the left-exact localization generated by \Sigma. In the course of the proof, we study the interaction of various types of factorization systems, and make essential use of the notion of a \emph{modality}, that is, a factorization system whose left class is stable by base change.
