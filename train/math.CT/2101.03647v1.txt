It is well know from universal algebra that, for every signature \Sigma, there exist algebras over \Sigma which are freely generated. Furthermore, they are, up to isomorphisms, unique, and equal to algebras of terms. Equivalently, the forgetful functor, from the category of \Sigma-algebras to \textbf{Set}, has a left adjoint.   This result does not extend to hyperalgebras, which generalize algebras by allowing the result of an operation to assume a non-empty set of values. Not only freely generated hyperalgebras do not exist, but the forgetful functor \mathcal{U}, from the category of \Sigma-hyperalgebras to \textbf{Set}, does not have a left adjoint.   In this paper we generalize, in a natural way, algebras of terms to hyperalgebras of terms, which display many properties of freely generated algebras: they extend uniquely to homomorphisms, not functions, but pairs of functions and collections of choices, which select how an homomorphism approaches indeterminacies; and they are generated by a set that fits a strong definition of basis, which we call the ground of the hyperalgebra. With these definitions at hand, we offer simplified proofs that freely generated hyperalgebras do not exist and that \mathcal{U} does not have a left adjoint.
