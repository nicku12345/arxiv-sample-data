To any Frobenius superalgebra A we associate an oriented Frobenius Brauer category and an affine oriented Frobenius Brauer categeory. We define natural actions of these categories on categories of supermodules for general linear Lie superalgebras \mathfrak{gl}_{m|n}(A) with entries in A. These actions generalize those on module categories for general linear Lie superalgebras and queer Lie superalgebras, which correspond to the cases where A is the ground field and the two-dimensional Clifford algebra, respectively.
