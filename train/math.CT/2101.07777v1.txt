In this thesis, we present a flexible framework for specifying and constructing operads which are suited to reasoning about network construction. The data used to present these operads is called a \emph{network model}, a monoidal variant of Joyal's combinatorial species. The construction of the operad required that we develop a monoidal lift of the Grothendieck construction. We then demonstrate how concepts like priority and dependency can be represented in this framework. For the former, we generalize Green's graph products of groups to the context of universal algebra. For the latter, we examine the emergence of monoidal fibrations from the presence of catalysts in Petri nets.
