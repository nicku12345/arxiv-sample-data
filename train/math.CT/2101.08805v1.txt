We describe dual notions of tangent bundle for an infinity-topos, each underlying a tangent infinity-category in the sense of Bauer, Burke and the author. One of those notions is Lurie's tangent bundle functor for presentable infinity-categories, and the other is its adjoint. We calculate that adjoint for injective infinity-toposes, where it is given by applying Lurie's tangent bundle on infinity-categories of points.
