One goal of applied category theory is to understand open systems. We compare two ways of describing open systems as cospans equipped with extra data. First, given a functor L \colon \mathsf{A} \to \mathsf{X}, a "structured cospan" is a diagram in \mathsf{X} of the form L(a) \rightarrow x \leftarrow L(b). If \mathsf{A} and \mathsf{X} have finite colimits and L preserves them, it is known that there is a symmetric monoidal double category whose objects are those of \mathsf{A} and whose horizontal 1-cells are structured cospans. Second, given a pseudofunctor F \colon \mathsf{A} \to \mathbf{Cat}, a "decorated cospan" is a diagram in \mathsf{A} of the form a \rightarrow m \leftarrow b together with an object of F(m). Generalizing the work of Fong, we show that if \mathsf{A} has finite colimits and F \colon (\mathsf{A},+) \to (\mathsf{Cat},\times) is symmetric lax monoidal, there is a symmetric monoidal double category whose objects are those of \mathsf{A} and whose horizontal 1-cells are decorated cospans. We prove that under certain conditions, these two constructions become isomorphic when we take \mathsf{X} = \int F to be the Grothendieck category of F. We illustrate these ideas with applications to electrical circuits, Petri nets, dynamical systems and epidemiological modeling.
