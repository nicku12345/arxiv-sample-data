For a monoidal \infty-category \mathcal{M} with colimits, we study colimits of \mathcal{M}-functors \mathcal{A}\to\mathcal{B} where \mathcal{B} is left-tensored over \mathcal{M} and \mathcal{A} is an \mathcal{M}-enriched category. We prove that the enriched Yoneda embedding Y:\mathcal{A}\to P_{\mathcal{M}}(\mathcal{A}) yields a universal \mathcal{M}-functor and, in the case when \mathcal{A} has a certain monoidal structure, the category of enriched presheaves P_{\mathcal{M}}(\mathcal{A}) inherits the same monoidal structure.
