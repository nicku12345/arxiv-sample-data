We propose a new approach to S-protomodular categories in the sense of D. Bourn, N. Martins-Ferreira, A. Montoli, and M. Sobral. Instead of points (=split epimorphisms) it uses generalized points, which we define as composable pairs of morphisms whose composites are pullback stable regular epimorphisms. This approach is convenient in describing the connection between split and regular Schreier epimorphisms of monoids.
