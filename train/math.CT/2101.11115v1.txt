As the complexity and heterogeneity of a system grows, the challenge of specifying, documenting and synthesizing correct, machine readable designs increases dramatically. Separation of the system into manageable parts is needed to support analysis at various levels of granularity so that the system is maintainable and adaptable over its life cycle. In this paper, we argue that operads provide an effective knowledge representation to address these challenges. Formal documentation of a syntactically correct complex design is built up during design synthesis, while semantic reasoning about which designs are effective guides the process. Throughout, the ability to break down the system into parts and reconstitute the whole is maintained. We describe recent progress in effective modeling under this paradigm and directions for future work to systematically address scalability challenges for complex system design.
