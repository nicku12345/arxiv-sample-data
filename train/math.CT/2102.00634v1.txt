A moment category is endowed with a distinguished set of split idempotents, called moments, which can be transported along morphisms. Equivalently, a moment category is a category with an active/inert factorisation system fulfilling two simple axioms. These axioms imply that the moments of a fixed object form a monoid, actually a left regular band.   Each locally finite unital moment category defines a specific type of operad which records the combinatorics of partitioning moments into elementary ones. In this way the notions of symmetric, non-symmetric and n-operad correspond to unital moment structures on \Gamma, \Delta and \Theta_n respectively.   There is an analog of Baez-Dolan's plus construction taking a unital moment category \mathbb{C} to a unital hypermoment category \mathbb{C}^+. Under this construction, \mathbb{C}-operads get identified with \mathbb{C}^+-monoids, i.e. presheaves on \mathbb{C}^+ satisfying Segal-like conditions strictly. We show that the plus construction of Segal's category \Gamma fully embeds into the dendroidal category \Omega of Moerdijk-Weiss.
