Given a monoidal category \mathcal{V} that acts on a 0-cell \mathcal{A} in a 2-category \mathfrak{M}, we give constructions of stabilization and costabilization of \mathcal{A} with respect to the \mathcal{V}-action. This provide a general unified treatment for the stabilization of homotopy theories. The constructions of stabilization and costabilization are defined via universal properties and they define two endofunctors on a 2-category of 0-cells with \mathcal{V}-actions in \mathfrak{M}. We show that several examples that exist in the literature fit into our setting after fixing the 0-cell \mathcal{A} and the \mathcal{V}-action on it. In particular, our constructions establish a duality between stable homotopy categories and Spanier-Whitehead categories.
