The aim of this work is to give a pointfree description of the Cantor set. It can be shown that the Cantor set is homeomorphic to the p-adic integers \mathbb{Z}_{p}:=\{x\in\mathbb{Q}_{p}: |x|_p\leq 1\} for every prime number p. To give a pointfree description of the Cantor set, we specify the frame of \mathbb{Z}_{p} by generators and relations. We use the fact that the open balls centered at integers generate the open subsets of \mathbb{Z}_{p} and thus we think of them as the basic generators; on this poset we impose some relations and then the resulting quotient is the frame of the Cantor set \mathcal{L}(\mathbb{Z}_{p}). We prove that \mathcal{L}(\mathbb{Z}_{p}) is a spatial frame whose space of points is homeomorphic to \mathbb{Z}_{p}. In particular, we show with pointfree arguments that \mathcal{L}(\mathbb{Z}_{p}) is 0-dimensional, (completely) regular, compact, and metrizable (it admits a countably generated uniformity). Finally, we give a point-free counterpart of the Hausdorff-Alexandroff Theorem which states that \emph{every compact metric space is a continuous image of the Cantor space} (see, e.g. \cite{Alexandroff} and \cite{Hausdorff}). We prove the point-free analog: if L is a compact metrizable frame, then there is an injective frame homomorphism from L into \mathcal{L}(\mathbb{Z}_{2}).
