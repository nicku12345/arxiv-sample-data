We prove that four different ways of defining Cartesian fibrations and the Cartesian model structure are all Quillen equivalent: On marked simplicial sets, on bisimplicial spaces, on bisimplicial sets, on marked simplicial spaces. The main way to prove these equivalences is by using the Quillen equivalences between quasi-categories and complete Segal spaces as defined by Joyal-Tierney and the straightening construction due to Lurie.
