For a category \mathcal E with finite limits and well-behaved countable coproducts, we construct a model structure, called the effective model structure, on the category of simplicial objects in \mathcal E, generalising the Kan--Quillen model structure on simplicial sets. We then prove that the effective model structure is left and right proper and satisfies descent in the sense of Rezk. As a consequence, we obtain that the associated \infty-category has finite limits, colimits satisfying descent, and is locally Cartesian closed when \mathcal E is, but is not a higher topos in general. We also characterise the \infty-category presented by the effective model structure, showing that it is the full sub-category of presheaves on \mathcal E spanned by Kan complexes in \mathcal E, a result that suggests a close analogy with the theory of exact completions.
