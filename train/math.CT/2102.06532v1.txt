A number of categories is presented that are algebraically complete and cocomplete, i.e., every endofunctor has an initial algebra and a terminal coalgebra. For all finitary (and, more generally, all precontinuous) set functors the initial algebra and terminal coalgebra are proved to carry a canonical partial order with the same ideal CPO-completion. And they also both carry a canonical ultrametric with the same Cauchy completion.
