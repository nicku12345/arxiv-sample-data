Let k be a field. We show that locally presentable, k-linear categories \mathcal{C} dualizable in the sense that the identity functor can be recovered as \coprod_i x_i\otimes f_i for objects x_i\in \mathcal{C} and left adjoints f_i from \mathcal{C} to \mathrm{Vect}_k are products of copies of \mathrm{Vect}_k. This partially confirms a conjecture by Brandenburg, the author and T. Johnson-Freyd. Motivated by this, we also characterize the Grothendieck categories containing an object x with the property that every object is a copower of x: they are precisely the categories of non-singular injective right modules over simple, regular, right self-injective rings of type I or III.
