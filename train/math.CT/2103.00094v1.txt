We study abelian envelopes for pseudo-tensor categories with the property that every object in the envelope is a quotient of an object in the pseudo-tensor category. We establish an intrinsic criterion on pseudo-tensor categories for the existence of an abelian envelope satisfying this quotient property. %We interpret extension of scalars and Deligne product of tensor categories as abelian envelopes and study abelian envelopes for pseudo-tensor subcategories of \Rep G for an affine group scheme. G This allows us to interpret the extension of scalars and Deligne tensor product of tensor categories as abelian envelopes, and to enlarge the class of tensor categories for which all extensions of scalars and tensor products are known to remain tensor categories. For an affine group scheme G, we show that pseudo-tensor subcategories of Rep G have abelian envelopes with the quotient property, and we study many other such examples. This leads us to conjecture that all abelian envelopes satisfy the quotient property.
