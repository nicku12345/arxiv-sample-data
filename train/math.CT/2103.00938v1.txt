We explore the notion of a category with coproducts \cup and a monoidal structure \otimes distributing over it, endowed with an endo-functor \partial which is "linear and Leibniz". Such \partial can be legitimately called a *derivation* on \mathcal{C}, and the pair (\mathcal{C},\partial) appears as the categorification of a differential ri(n)g: a differential 2-rig.   We explore a number of possible special examples: when \mathcal{C} is semicartesian (i.e., its \otimes-monoidal unit is the terminal object), derivations are better behaved in some respect; interesting examples arise when \mathcal{C}=[\mathcal{A},\textsf{Set}] is a presheaf topos endowed with a convolution product: among these, the operation of Brzozowski's derivative in formal language theory; we retrieve the "chain rule" in a category of "non-symmetric species" [\textsf{Fin},\textsf{Set}], obtained when a substitution product F\diamond G is interpreted as composition T_F\circ T_G of the associated finitary functors, regarded as formal power series.   Derivations on a 2-rig are tightly related to *tensorial strengths*; this draws a connection between the present theory and applicative structures in functional programming. Moreover, given a derivation on \mathcal{C}, the derivative of the \otimes-monoidal unit \partial I is a *self-similar* object, i.e. a solution to the equation X\cong X\cup X; we explore the many consequences of this apparently innocuous observation. This has connection with the category-theoretic analysis of dynamical systems.
