In the last few years, Lopez-Permouth and several collaborators have introduced a new approach in the study of the classical projectivity, injectivity and flatness of modules. This way, they introduced subprojectivity domains of modules as a tool to measure, somehow, the projectivity level of such a module (so not just to determine whether or not the module is projective). In this paper we develop a new treatment of the subprojectivity in any abelian category which shed more light on some of its various important aspects. Namely, in terms of subprojectivity, some classical results are unified and some classical rings are characterized. It is also shown that, in some categories, the subprojectivity measures notions other than the projectivity. Furthermore, this new approach allows, in addition to establishing nice generalizations of known results, to construct various new examples such as the subprojectivity domain of the class of Gorenstein projective objects, the class of semi-projective complexes and particular types of representations of a finite linear quiver. The paper ends with a study showing that the fact that a subprojectivity domain of a class coincides with its first right Ext-orthogonal class can be characterized in terms of the existence of preenvelopes and precovers.
