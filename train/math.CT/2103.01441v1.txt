Assume k is a field and let F:C\rightarrow Vect_{k} be a small k-linear functor from a k-linear abelian category C to the category of vector spaces over the field k, the purpose of this note is to use a little knowledge of linear algebra and category to give the description of end(F) and coend(F), and then we give the reconstruction theorem of bialgebras by using this description. We use a constructive approach to understand end(F),coend(F) and we describe the bialgebra structure of coend(F) concretely when F is a tensor functor.
