We show that the comma category (\mathcal{F}\downarrow\mathbf{Grp}) of groups under the free group functor \mathcal{F}: \mathbf{Set} \to \mathbf{Grp} contains the category \mathbf{Gph} of simple graphs as a full coreflective subcategory. More broadly, we generalize the embedding of topological spaces into Steven Vickers' category of topological systems to a simple technique for embedding certain categories into comma categories, then show as a straightforward application that simple graphs are coreflective in (\mathcal{F}\downarrow\mathbf{Grp}).
