In this article, we introduce the first degrees of a cochain complex associated to a strict Lie 2-group whose cohomology is shown to extend the classical cohomology theory of Lie groups. In particular, we show that the second cohomology group classifies an appropriate type of extension. We conclude by putting forward evidence that this complex can be extended to arbitrary degrees.
