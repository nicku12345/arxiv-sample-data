We prove general adjoint functor theorems for weakly (co)complete n-categories. This class of n-categories includes the homotopy n-categories of (co)complete \infty-categories -- in particular, these n-categories do not admit all small (co)limits in general. We also introduce Brown representability for (homotopy) n-categories and prove a Brown representability theorem for localizations of compactly generated n-categories. This class of n-categories includes the homotopy n-categories of presentable \infty-categories if n \geq 2 and the homotopy n-categories of stable presentable \infty-categories for any n \geq 1.
