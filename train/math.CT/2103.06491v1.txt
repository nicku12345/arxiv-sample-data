Let H be a complex Lie group acting holomorphically on a complex analytic space X such that every H-invariant regular function on X_{red} is constant. We prove that an H-equivariant holomorphic vector bundle E over X is H-finite, meaning f_1(E)= f_2(E) as H-equivariant bundles for two distinct polynomials f_1 and f_2 whose coefficients are nonnegative integers, if and only if the pullback of E along some H-equivariant finite \'etale covering of X is trivial as an H-equivariant bundle.
