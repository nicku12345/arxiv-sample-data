We associate to a braided 2-stack {\cal C} a torsor, endowed with a symmetric cube structure (or \Sigma-structure), whose triviality is equivalent to the existence on {\cal C} of a fully symmetric monoidal structure. In order to perform the analogous construction for braided 4-stacks, it is necessary to introduce the notion of a \Gamma_3-torsor pair, which is in the same relation to cubic forms as torsors with \Sigma-structure are to quadratic ones.
