We look at strict n-groupoids and show that if \Re is any realization functor from the category of strict n-groupoids to the category of spaces satisfying a minimal property of compatibility with homotopy groups, then there is no strict n-groupoid G such that \Re (G) is the n-type of S^2 (for n\geq 3). At the end we speculate on how one might fix this problem by introducing a notion of ``snucategory'', a strictly associative n-category with only weak units.
