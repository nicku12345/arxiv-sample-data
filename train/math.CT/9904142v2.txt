This is the central article of a series of three papers on cross product bialgebras. We present a universal theory of bialgebra factorizations (or cross product bialgebras) with cocycles and dual cocycles. We also provide an equivalent (co-)modular co-cyclic formulation. All known examples as for instance bi- or smash, doublecross and bicross product bialgebras as well as double biproduct bialgebras and bicrossed or cocycle bicross product bialgebras are now united within a single theory. Furthermore our construction yields various novel types of cross product bialgebras.
