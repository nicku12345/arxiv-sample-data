Berikashvili's functor D defined in terms of twisting cochains is related to deformation theory, gauge theory, Chen's formal power series connections, and the master equation in physics. The idea is advertised that some unification and understanding of the links between these topics is provided by the notion of twisting cochain and the idea of classifying twisting cochains.
