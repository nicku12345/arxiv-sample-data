It is proved that equalities between arrows assumed for cartesian categories are maximal in the sense that extending them with any new equality in the language of free cartesian categories collapses a cartesian category into a preorder. An analogous result holds for categories with binary products, which may lack a terminal object. The proof is based on a coherence result for cartesian categories, which is related to model-theoretical methods of normalization.
