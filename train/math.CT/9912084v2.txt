Informally, a homotopy monoid is a monoid-like structure in which properties such as associativity only hold `up to homotopy' in some consistent way. This short paper comprises a rigorous definition of homotopy monoid and a brief analysis of some examples. It is a much-abbreviated version of the paper `Homotopy Algebras for Operads' (math.QA/0002180), and does not assume any knowledge of operads.
