This article discusses questions in one and several complex variables about the size of the sum of the moduli of the terms of the series expansion of a bounded holomorphic function. Although the article is partly expository, it also includes some previously unpublished results with complete proofs.   The article is based on a lecture at the third Korean several complex variables symposium held at the Global Analysis Research Center at Seoul National University in December 1998.
