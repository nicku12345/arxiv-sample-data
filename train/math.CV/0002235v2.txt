Let f : (M,p)\to (M',p') be a formal biholomorphic mapping between two germs of real analytic hypersurfaces in \C^n, p'=f(p). Assuming the source manifold to be minimal at p, we prove the convergence of the so-called reflection function associated to f. As a consequence, we derive the convergence of formal biholomorphisms between real analytic minimal holomorphically nondegenerate hypersurfaces. Related results on partial convergence of formal biholomorphisms are also obtained.
