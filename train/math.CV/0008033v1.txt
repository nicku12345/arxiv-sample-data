The intersection index at a common point of two analytic varieties of complementary dimensions in \Bbb C^n is positive. This observation, which has been called a ``cornerstone'' of algebraic geometry ([GH, p.~62]), is a simple consequence of the fact that analytic varieties carry a natural orientation. Recast in terms of linking numbers, it is our principal motivation. It implies the following: Let M be a smooth oriented compact 3-manifold in \Bbb C^3. Suppose that M bounds a bounded complex 2-variety V. Here ``bounds'' means, in the sense of Stokes' theorem, i.e., that {b[V]}={[M]} as currents. Let A be an algebraic curve in \Bbb C^3 which is disjoint from M. Consider the linking number {\rm link}(M,A) of M and A. Since this linking number is equal to the intersection number (i.e. the sum of the intersection indices) of V and A, by the positivity of these intersection indices, we have {\rm link}(M,A) \geq 0. The linking number will of course be 0 if V and A are disjoint. (As A is not compact, this usage of ``linking number'' will be clarified later.) This reasoning shows more generally that {\rm link}(M,A) \geq 0 if M bounds a positive holomorphic 2-chain. Recall that a {\it holomorphic k-chain} in \Omega \subseteq \Bbb C^n is a sum \sum n_j [V_j] where \{V_j\} is a locally finite family of irreducible k-dimensional subvarieties of \Omega and n_j \in \Bbb Z and that the holomorphic 2-chain is {\it positive} if n_j >0 for all j. Our first result is that, conversely, the nonnegativity of the linking number characterizes boundaries of positive holomorphic 2-chains.
