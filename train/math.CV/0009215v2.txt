For a domain D\subset{\Bbb C} the Kobayashi--Royden \kappa and Hahn h pseudometrics are equal iff D is simply connected. Overholt showed that for D\subset{\Bbb C}^n, n\geq3, we have h_D\equiv\kappa_D. Let D_1,D_2\subset{\Bbb C}. The aim of this paper is to show that h_{D_1\times D_2}\equiv\kappa_{D_1\times D_2} iff at least one of D_1, D_2 is simply connected or biholomorphic to {\Bbb C}\setminus\{0\}. In particular, there are domains D\subset{\Bbb C}^2 for which h_D\not\equiv\kappa_D.
