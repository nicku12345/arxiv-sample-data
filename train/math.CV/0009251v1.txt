Every nonconstant meromorphic function in the plane univalently covers spherical discs of radii arbitrarily close to arctan(sqrt 8) ~ 70^\circ 32'. If in addition all critical points of the function are multiple, then a similar statement holds with pi/2. These constants are the best possible. The proof is based on the consideration of negatively curved singular surfaces associated with meromorphic functions.
