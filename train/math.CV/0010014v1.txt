This paper studies Fefferman's program \cite{F3} of expressing the singularity of the Bergman kernel, for smoothly bounded strictly pseudoconvex domains \Omega\subset\C^n, in terms of local biholomorphic invariants of the boundary. By \cite{F1}, the Bergman kernel on the diagonal K(z,\c{z}) is written in the form    K=\phi r^{-n-1}+\psi \log r \qtext{with}   \phi,\psi\in C^\infty(\c\Omega),  where r is a (smooth) defining function of \Omega. Recently, Bailey, Eastwood and Graham \cite{BEG}, building on Fefferman's earlier work \cite{F3}, obtained a full invariant expression of the strong singularity \phi r^{-n-1}. The purpose of this paper is to give a full invariant expression of the weak singularity \psi\log r.
