Generalized Lelong numbers of plurisubharmonic functions with respect to plurisubharmonic weights (due to Demailly) are specified for weights with multicircled asymptotics. Explicit formulas for these values are obtained in terms of the directional Lelong numbers of the functions and the Newton diagrams of the weights. An extension of Demailly's approximation theorem is proved as well.
