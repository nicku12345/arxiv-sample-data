We prove the following Hartogs-Bochner type theorem: Let M be a connected C^2 hypersurface of P_n(\mathbb{C}) (n\geq 2) which divides P_n(\mathbb{C}) in two connected open sets \Omega_1 and \Omega_2. Then there exists i \in \{1,2\} such that C^{1} CR functions defined on M extends holomorphically to \Omega_i.
