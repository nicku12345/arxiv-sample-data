In this paper we investigate the global behavior of proper holomorphic maps f from the unit disc U={|z|<1} to C^2. The fact that U is transcendental imposes certain restrictions on the image f(U). For instance, f(U) cannot be contained in any proper complex cone in C^2 since this would force it to be algebraic. On the other hand, we show that a real cone in C^2 with axis R^2 contains the image of a proper holomorphic map f from U to C^2 if and only if the angle of the cone is larger than pi/2. We also construct maps f as above whose images avoid both coordinate axes in C^2. Equivalently, we construct a pair of positive harmonic functions u, v on U such that max{u(z),v(z)} tends to plus infinity when z tends to the boundary of U. Furthermore we show that the components f_1, f_1 of a proper holomorphic map from U to C^2, as well as polynomial and certain rational functions of f_1 and f_2, have the property that their essential range at any boundary point of U omits at most a polar set in C.
