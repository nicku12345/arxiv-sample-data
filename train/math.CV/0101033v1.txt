We construct closed complex submanifolds of dimension three in C^5 which are differential complete intersections but not holomorphic complete intersections. We also prove a homotopy principle concerning the removal of intersections of holomorphic mappings from Stein manifolds to complex Euclidean spaces C^d with certain closed complex subvarities of C^d.
