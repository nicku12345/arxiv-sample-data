Let X be a Stein manifold and let Y be a complex manifold which admits a spray in the sense of Gromov (Oka's principle for holomorphic sections of elliptic bundles, J. Amer. Math. Soc. 2, pp. 851-897 (1989)). We prove that for every closed complex subvariety X_0 of X and for every continuous map f_0 from X to Y whose restriction to X_0 is holomorphic there exists a homotopy of maps f_t from X to Y whose restrictions to X_0 agree with f_0 and such that the map f_1 is holomorphic on X. We obtain analogous results for sections of holomorphic submersions with sprays over Stein manifolds or Stein spaces. Our results extend those of Grauert (Holomorphe Funktionen mit Werten in komplexen Lieschen Gruppen, Math. Ann. 133, pp. 450-472 (1957)) and Forster and Ramspott (Analytische Modulgarben und Endromisbundel, Invent. Math. 2, pp. 145-170 (1966)).
