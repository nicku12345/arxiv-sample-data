We prove a theorem of M. Gromov (Oka's principle for holomorphic sections of elliptic bundles, J. Amer. Math. Soc. 2, 851-897, 1989) to the effect that sections of certain holomorphic submersions h from a complex manifold Z onto a Stein manifold X satisfy the Oka principle, meaning that the inclusion of the space of holomorphic sections into the space of continuous sections is a weak homotopy equivalence. The Oka principle holds if the submersion admits a fiber-dominating spray over a small neighborhood of any point in X. This extends a classical result of Grauert (Holomorphe Funktionen mit Werten in komplexen Lieschen Gruppen, Math. Ann. 133, 450-472, 1957). Gromov's result has been used in the proof of the embedding theorems for Stein manifolds and Stein spaces into Euclidean spaces of minimal dimension (Y. Eliashberg and M. Gromov, Ann. Math. 136, 123-135, 1992; J. Schurmann, Math. Ann. 307, 381-399, 1997). For further extensions see the preprints math.CV/0101034, math.CV/0107039, and math.CV/0110201.
