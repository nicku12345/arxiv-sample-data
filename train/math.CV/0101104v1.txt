In section 1, we show that if X is a Stein normal complex space of dimension n and D\subset \subset X an open subset which is the union of an increasing sequence D_{1}\subset D_{2}\subset ...\subset D_{n}\subset >... of domains of holomorphy in X. Then D is a domain of holomorphy.   In section 2, we prove that a domain of holomorphy D which is relatively compact in a 2-dimensional normal Stein space X itself is Stein.   In section 3, we show that if X is a Stein space of dimension n and D\subset X an open subspace which is the union of an increasing sequence D_{1}\subset D_{2}\subset ...\subset D_{n}\subset ... of open Stein subsets of X. then D itself is Stein, if X has isolated singularities.
