It is known from the Runge approximation theorem that every function which is holomorphic in a neighborhood of a compact polynomially convex set K\subset \complexes^{n} can be approximated uniformly on K by analytic polynomials. We shall here prove the same result when the role of the polynomially convex hull \hat {K} is played by the generalized polynomial hull h_{q}(K) introduced by Basener and which can be defined, for each integer q\in {0,...,n-1}, by h_{q}(K)=\displaystyle\bigcup_{P\in \complexes [z_{1},...,z_{n}]} A_{P} where A_{P}=\{z\in \complexes^{n}: |P(z)|\leq \delta_{K}(P,z)\}, and where \delta_{K}(P,z) denotes the lowest value of ||P||_{K\cap f^{-1}(0)} when f ranges in the set of holomorphic polynomial maps \complexes^{n}\to \complexes^{q} vanishing at z.
