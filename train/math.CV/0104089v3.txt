Let D_j\subset\Bbb C^{k_j} be a pseudoconvex domain and let A_j\subset D_j be a locally pluripolar set, j=1,...,N. PutX:=\bigcup_{j=1}^N A_1\times...\times A_{j-1}\times D_j\times A_{j+1}\times...\times A_N\subset\Bbb C^{k_1+...+k_N}.Let U be an open connected neighborhood of X and let M\varsubsetneq U be an analytic subset. Then there exists an analytic subset \hat M of the `envelope of holomorphy' \hat X of X with \hat M\cap X\subset M such that for every function f separately holomorphic on X\setminus M there exists an \hat f holomorphic on \hat X\setminus\hat M with \hat f|_{X\setminus M}=f. The result generalizes special cases which were studied in \cite{\"Okt 1998}, \cite{\"Okt 1999}, \cite{Sic 2000}, and \cite{Jar-Pfl 2001}.
