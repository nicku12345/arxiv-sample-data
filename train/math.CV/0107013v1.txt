We show that germs of local real-analytic CR automorphisms of a real-analytic hypersurface M in \C^2 at a point p\in M are uniquely determined by their jets of some finite order at p if and only if M is not Levi-flat near p. This seems to be the first necessary and sufficient result on finite jet determination and the first result of this kind in the infinite type case.   If M is of finite type at p, we prove a stronger assertion: the local real-analytic CR automorphisms of M fixing p are analytically parametrized (and hence uniquely determined) by their 2-jets at p. This result is optimal since the automorphisms of the unit sphere are not determined by their 1-jets at a point of the sphere.
