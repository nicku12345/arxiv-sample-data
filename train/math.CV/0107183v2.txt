This paper studies microlocal regularity properties of the distributions f on a strongly noncharacteristic submanifold E of a hypo-analytic manifold M that arise as the boundary values of solutions on wedges in M with edge E. The hypo-analytic wave-front set of f in the sense of Baouendi-Chang-Treves is constrained as a consequence of the fact that f extends as a solution to a wedge.
