We prove that solutions of the homogeneous equation Lu=0, where L is a locally integrable vector field with smooth coefficients in two variables possess the F. and M. Riesz property. That is, if \Omega is an open subset of the plane with smooth boundary, u\in C^1(\Omega) satisfies Lu=0 on \Omega, has tempered growth at the boundary, and its weak boundary value is a measure \mu, then \mu is absolutely continuous with respect to Lebesgue measure on the noncharacteristic portion of \partial\Omega.
