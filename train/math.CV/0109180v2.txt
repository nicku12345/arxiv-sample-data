Let {\bold M}_0 be a compact, regular q-pseudoconcave compact CR submanifold of a complex manifold {\bold G} and {\cal B} - a holomorphic vector bundle on {\bold G} such that \dim H^r({\bold M}_0, {\cal B}\big|_{\bold M})=0 for some fixed r<q. We prove a global homotopy formula with C^k estimates for r-cohomology of {\cal B} on arbitrary CR submanifold {\bold M} close enough to {\bold M}_0.
