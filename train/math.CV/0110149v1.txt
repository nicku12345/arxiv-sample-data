Let M be a non-compact connected Riemann surface of finite type, and R\subset\subset M be a relatively compact domain such that H_{1}(M,\Z)=H_{1}(R,\Z). Let \tilde R\longrightarrow R be a covering. We study the algebra H^{\infty}(U) of bounded holomorphic functions defined in some domains U\subset\tilde R. Our main result is a Forelli type theorem on projections in H^{\infty}(\Di).
