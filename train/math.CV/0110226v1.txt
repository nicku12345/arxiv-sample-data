This paper studies complex cobordisms between compact, three dimensional, strictly pseudoconvex Cauchy-Riemann manifolds. Suppose the complex cobordism is given by a complex 2-manifold X with one pseudoconvex and one pseudoconcave end. We answer the following questions. What is the relation between the embeddability of the pseudoconvex end and the embeddability of the pseudoconcave end of X? Do all CR-functions on the pseudoconvex end of X extend to holomorphic functions on the interior of X?   We prove that embeddability of a strictly pseudoconvex Cauchy-Riemann 3-manifold is not a complex-cobordism invariant. We show that a new phenomenon occurs: there are CR-functions on the pseudoconvex end that do not extend to holomorphic functions on X. We also show that the extendability of the CR-functions from the pseudoconvex end is necessary but not sufficient for embeddability to be preserved under complex cobordisms.
