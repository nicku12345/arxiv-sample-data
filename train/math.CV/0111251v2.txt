We show that a disc functional on a complex manifold has a plurisubharmonic envelope if all its pullbacks by holomorphic submersions from domains of holomorphy in affine space do and it is locally bounded above and upper semicontinuous in a certain weak sense. For naturally defined classes of disc functionals on manifolds, this result reduces a property somewhat stronger than having a plurisubharmonic envelope to the affine case. The proof uses a recent Stein neighbourhood construction of Rosay, who proved the plurisubharmonicity of the Poisson envelope on all manifolds. As a consequence, the Riesz envelope and the Lelong envelope are plurisubharmonic on all manifolds; for the former, we make use of new work of Edigarian. The basic theory of the three main classes of disc functionals is thereby extended to all manifolds.
