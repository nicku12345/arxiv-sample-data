Let D_j\subset\Bbb C^{n_j} be a pseudoconvex domain and let A_j\subset D_j be a locally pluriregular set, j=1,...,N. Put  X:=\bigcup_{j=1}^N A_1\times...\times A_{j-1}\times D_j\times A_{j+1}\times ...\times A_N\subset\Bbb C^{n_1}\times...\times\Bbb C^{n_N}=\Bbb C^n.  Let U\subset\Bbb C^n be an open neighborhood of X and let M\subset U be a relatively closed subset of U. For j\in\{1,...,N\} let \Sigma_j be the set of all (z',z'')\in(A_1\times...\times A_{j-1}) \times(A_{j+1}\times...\times A_N) for which the fiber M_{(z',\cdot,z'')}:=\{z_j\in\Bbb C^{n_j}\: (z',z_j,z'')\in M\} is not pluripolar. Assume that \Sigma_1,...,\Sigma_N are pluripolar. Put  X':=\bigcup_{j=1}^N\{(z',z_j,z'')\in(A_1\times...\times A_{j-1})\times D_j \times(A_{j+1}\times...\times A_N)\: (z',z'')\notin\Sigma_j\}.  Then there exists a relatively closed pluripolar subset \hat M\subset\hat X of the `envelope of holomorphy' \hat X\subset\Bbb C^n of X such that: \hat M\cap X'\subset M, for every function f separately holomorphic on X\setminus M there exists exactly one function \hat f holomorphic on \hat X\setminus\hat M with \hat f=f on X'\setminus M, and \hat M is singular with respect to the family of all functions \hat f. Some special cases were previously studied in \cite{Jar-Pfl 2001c}.
