The following result is proved: Let D and D' be bounded domains in \mathbb C^n, \partial D is smooth, real-analytic, simply connected, and \partial D' is connected, smooth, real-algebraic. Then there exists a proper holomorphic correspondence f:D\to D' if and only if \partial D and \partial D' a locally CR-equivalent. This leads to a characterization of the equivalence relationship between bounded domains in \mathbb C^n modulo proper holomorphic correspondences in terms of CR-equivalence of their boundaries.
