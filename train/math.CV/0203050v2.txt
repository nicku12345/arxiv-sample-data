Let \Omega be a bounded, weakly convex domain in C^n, n>1, having real-analytic boundary. A(\Omega) is the algebra of all functions holomorphic in \Omega and continuous upto the boundary. A submanifold M\subset \partial\Omega is said to be complex-tangential if T_p(M) lies in the maximal complex subspace of T_p(\partial\Omega) for each p \in M. We show that for real-analytic submanifolds M\subset \partial\Omega, if M is complex-tangential, then every compact subset of M is a peak-interpolation set for A(\Omega).
