Let Y be a regular covering of a complex projective manifold M\hookrightarrow CP^{N} of dimension n\geq 2. Let C be intersection with M of at most n-1 generic hypersurfaces of degree d in CP^{N}. The preimage X of C in Y is a connected submanifold. Let H^{\infty}(Y) and H^{\infty}(X) be the Banach spaces of bounded holomorphic functions on Y and X in the corresponding supremum norms. We prove that the restriction H^{\infty}(Y)\longrightarrow H^{\infty}(X) is an isometry for d large enough. This answers the question posed in [L] by F. Larusson and strengthen his example of the Riemann surface with large corona.
