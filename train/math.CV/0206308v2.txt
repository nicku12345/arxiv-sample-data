Let T be a positive plurisubharmonic current of bidimension (p,p) and let \delta>0. Assume that the Lelong number of T satisfies \nu(T,a)\geq \delta on a dense subset of supp(T) (rectifiable currents satisfy this condition). Then T=\phi[X], where X is a complex subvariety of pure dimension p and \phi is a weakly plurisubharmonic function on X. We have an analogous result for plurisuperharmonic currents. We also introduce and study a notion of polynomial p-hull.
