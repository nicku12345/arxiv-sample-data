This is an addendum to our earlier paper on the defect of an ample divisor of an abelian variety. It modifies an argument of the original paper to handle one difficulty there. At the same time the modification improves the result in the original paper by replacing the counting function by one truncated at a multiplicity given by an explicit function of the dimension of the abelian variety and the Chern number of the divisor.
