Let F=(F_1, F_2, ... F_n) be an n-tuple of formal power series in n variables of the form F(z)=z+ O(|z|^2). It is known that there exists a unique formal differential operator A=\sum_{i=1}^n a_i(z)\frac {\p}{\p z_i} such that F(z)=exp (A)z as formal series. In this article, we show the Jacobian {\cal J}(F) and the Jacobian matrix J(F) of F can also be given by some exponential formulas. Namely, {\cal J}(F)=\exp (A+\triangledown A)\cdot 1, where \triangledown A(z)= \sum_{i=1}^n \frac {\p a_i}{\p z_i}(z), and J(F)=\exp(A+R_{Ja})\cdot I_{n\times n}, where I_{n\times n} is the identity matrix and R_{Ja} is the multiplication operator by Ja for the right. As an immediate consequence, we get an elementary proof for the known result that {\cal J}(F)\equiv 1 if and only if \triangledown A=0. Some consequences and applications of the exponential formulas as well as their relations with the well known Jacobian Conjecture are also discussed.
