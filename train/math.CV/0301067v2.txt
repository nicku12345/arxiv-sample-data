This is a survey on the homotopy principle in complex analysis on Stein manifolds, also called the Oka principle in this context. We concentrate on the following topics: the Oka-Grauert principle (classification of holomorphic vector bundles); the homotopy principle for holomorphic mappings from Stein manifolds and, more generally, for sections of holomorphic submersions with sprays; question on removability of intersections of holomorphic mappings with complex subvarieties; embeddings and immersions of Stein manifolds in affine spaces of minimal dimension; embeddings of open Riemann surfaces in the affine plane; noncritical holomorphic functions on Stein manifolds and the Oka principle for holomorphic submersions of Stein manifolds to affine spaces.
