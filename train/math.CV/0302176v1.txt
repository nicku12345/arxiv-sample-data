There are considered vector fields and quaternionic \alpha-hyperholomorphic functions in a domain of R^2 which generalize the notion of solenoidal and irrotational vector fields. There are established sufficient conditions for the corresponding Cauchy-type integral along a closed Jordan rectifiable curve to be continuously extended onto the closure of a domain. The Sokhotski-Plemelj-type formulas are proved as well.
