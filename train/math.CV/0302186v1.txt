The main aim of this paper is to describe the most adequate generalization of the Cauchy-Riemann system fixing properties of classical functions in octonionic case. An octonionic generalization of the Laplace transform is introduced. Octonionic generalizations of the inversion transformation, the gamma function and the Riemann zeta-function are given.
