This paper is an elaboration of an introductory talk given by the author at a workshop on Clifford algebras at Tennessee Technical University, in May 2002. We give an introduction to the basic concepts of Clifford analysis, including links to harmonic analysis, Fourier analysis and conformally flat manifolds.
