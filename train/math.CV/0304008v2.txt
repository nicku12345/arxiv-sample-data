Let (X_R, 0) be a germ of real analytic subset in (R^N, 0) of pure dimension n+1 with an isolated singularity at 0. Let (f_R,0) : (X_R, 0) --> (R,0) a real analytic germ with an isolated singularity at 0, such that its complexification f_C vanishes on the singular set S of X_C. We also assume that X_R-[0] is orientable. To each  A \in H^{0}(X_{\mathbb{R}} - \lbrace 0 \rbrace ,\mathbb {C})  we associate a n-cycle  \Gamma(A)  ("explicitly " described) in the complex Milnor fiber of f_{\mathbb{C}} at 0 such that the non trivial terms in the asymptotic expansions of the oscillating integrals  \int_{A} e^{i\tau f(x)} \phi(x)  when  \tau \to \pm \infty  can be read from the spectral decomposition of \Gamma(A)  relative to the monodromy of f_{\mathbb{C}} at 0 .
