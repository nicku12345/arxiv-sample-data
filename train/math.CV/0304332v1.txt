We describe some results of value distribution theory of holomorphic curves and quasiregular maps, which are obtained using potential theory. Among the results discussed are: extensions of Picard's theorems to quasiregular maps between Riemannian manifolds, a version of the Second Main Theorem of Nevanlinna for curves in projective space and non-linear divisors, description of extremal functions in Nevanlinna theory and results related to Cartan's 1928 conjecture on holomorphic curves in the unit disc omitting hyperplanes.
