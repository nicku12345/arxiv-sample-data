We study the structure of complex points on real surfaces, embedded into complex Elliptic surfaces. We show, for example, that any compact surface has a totally real embedding into a blow-up of a K3 surface. We also exhibit smooth disc bundles over compact orientable surfaces that have a Stein structure as Stein domains inside Elliptic surfaces.
