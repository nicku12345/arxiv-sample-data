Define S(n,\beta) to be the set of complex polynomials of degree n \ge 2 with all roots in the unit disk and at least one root at \beta. For a polynomial P, define |P|_\beta to be the distance between \beta and the closest root of the derivative P'. Finally, define r_n(\beta)=\sup \{|P|_\beta : P \in S(n,\beta) \}. In this notation, a conjecture of Bl. Sendov claims that r_n(\beta) \le 1.   In this paper we investigate Sendov's conjecture near the unit circle, by computing constants C_1 and C_2 (depending only on n) such that r_n(\beta) \sim 1 + C_1 (1-|\beta|) + C_2 (1-|\beta|)^2 for |\beta| near 1. We also consider some consequences of this approximation.
