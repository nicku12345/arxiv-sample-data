Given a real-analytic Riemannian manifold X there is a canonical complex structure, which is compatible with the canonical complex structure on T^*X and makes the leaves of the Riemannian foliation on TX into holomorphic curves, on its tangent bundle. A {\it Grauert tube} over X of radius r, denoted as T^rX, is the collection of tangent vectors of X of length less than r equipped with this canonical complex structure.   In this article, we prove the following two rigidity property of Grauert tubes. First, for any real-analytic Riemannian manifold such that r_{max}>0, we show that the identity component of the automorphism group of T^rX is isomorphic to the identity component of the isometry group of X provided that r<r_{max}. Secondly, let X be a homogeneous Riemannian manifold and let the radius r<r_{max}, then the automorphism group of T^rX is isomorphic to the isometry group of X and there is a unique Grauert tube representation for such a complex manifold T^rX.
