Given a real-analytic Riemannian manifold M there exists a canonical complex structure on part of its tangent bundle which turns leaves of the Riemannian foliation on TM into holomorphic curves. A Grauert tube over M of radius r, denoted as T^rM, is the collection of tangent vectors of M of length less than r equipped with this canonical complex structure. We say the Grauert tube   T^rM is rigid if Aut(T^rM) is coming from Isom (M).   In this article, we prove the rigidity for Grauert tubes over quasi-homogeneous Riemannian manifolds. A Riemannian manifold (M,g) is quasi-homogeneous if the quotient space M/Isom_0 (M) is compact. This category has included compact Riemannian manifolds, homogeneous Riemannian manifolds, co-compact Riemannian manifolds whose isometry groups have dimensions >0, and products of the above spaces.
