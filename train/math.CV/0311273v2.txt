We prove that a Kleinian group G acting upon \mathbb{H}^{3} admits a non-constant G-automorphic function, even if it has torsion elements, provided that the orders of the elliptic (i.e torsion) elements are uniformly bounded. This is accomplished by developing a technique for meshing distinct fat triangulations while preserving fatness. We further show how to adapt the proof to higher dimensions.
