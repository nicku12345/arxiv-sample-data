The author showed that a sequence in the unit disk is a zero sequence for the Bergman space A^p if and only if a certain weighted space L^p(W} contains a nontrivial analytic function. In this paper it is shown that the sequence is an interpolating sequence for A^p if and only if it is separated in the hyperbolic metric and the \bar\partial-equation (1 - |z|^2)\bar\partial u = f has a solution u belonging to L^p(W) for every f in L^p(W).
