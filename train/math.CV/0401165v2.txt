For a compact set E \subset \mathbb{C} containing more than two points, we study asymptotic behavior of normalized zero counting measures \{\mu_k \} of the derivatives of Faber polynomials associated with E. For example if E has empty interior, we prove that \{\mu_k \} converges in the weak-star topology to a measure whose support is the boundary of g(\mathcal{D}), where g : \{|z| > r \}\cup \{\infty\} \to \bar{\mathbb{C}} \backslash E is a universal covering map such that g(\infty) = \infty and \mathcal{D} is the Dirichlet domain associated with g and centered at \infty.   Our results are counterparts of those of Kuijlaars and Saff (1995) on zeros of Faber polynomials.
