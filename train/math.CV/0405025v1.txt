We show that if the graph of a bounded analytic function in the unit disk \mathbb D is not complete pluripolar in \mathbb C^2 then the projection of the closure of its pluripolar hull contains a fine neighborhood of a point p \in \partial \mathbb D. On the other hand we show that if an analytic function f in \mathbb D extends to a function \mathcal{F} which is defined on a fine neighborhood of a point p \in \partial \mathbb D and is finely analytic at p then the pluripolar hull of the graph of f contains the graph of \mathcal{F} over a smaller fine neighborhood of p. We give several examples of functions with this property of fine analytic continuation. As a corollary we obtain new classes of analytic functions in the disk which have non-trivial pluripolar hulls, among them C^\infty functions on the closed unit disk which are nowhere analytically extendible and have infinitely-sheeted pluripolar hulls. Previous examples of functions with non-trivial pluripolar hull of the graph have fine analytic continuation.
