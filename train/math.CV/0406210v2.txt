We give a very simple argument to the effect that most germs of generic real analytic Cauchy-Riemann manifolds of positive CR dimension are not holomorphically embeddable into any generic real algebraic CR manifold of the same real codimension in a finite dimensional space. In particular, most such germs are not holomorphically equivalent to a germ of a generic real algebraic CR manifold.
