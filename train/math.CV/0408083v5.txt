Let g be a holomorphic function in the neighbourhoods of an isolated essential singularity v: if g omits a complex value there, then v may be approached by a sequence of repelling fixed points for g, whose multipliers diverge to \infty. This implies that an entire function omitting a value or a non-M\"obius self-map of the punctured plane admit infinite repelling fixed points, whose multipliers diverge to \infty. By another point of view, we show that, if v is not Picard-exceptional for g, then v can be approached by a sequence of 2-cycles of g: these cycles are repelling if v is not a completely branched value.
