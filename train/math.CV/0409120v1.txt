We define a class of generic CR submanifolds of C^n of real codimension d, with d in 1, ..., n-1, called the Bloom-Graham model graphs, whose graphing functions are partially decoupled in their dependence on the variables in the real directions. We prove a global version of the Baouendi-Treves CR approximation theorem, for Bloom-Graham model graphs with a polynomial growth assumption on their graphing functions.
