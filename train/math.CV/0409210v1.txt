Let T be a positive closed current of bidimension (1,1) and unit mass on the complex projective space {\Bbb P}^n. We prove that the set V_\alpha(T) of points where T has Lelong number larger than \alpha is contained in a complex line if \alpha\geq2/3, and |V_\alpha(T)\setminus L|\leq1 for some complex line L if 1/2\leq\alpha<2/3. We also prove that in dimension 2 and if 2/5\leq\alpha<1/2, then |V_\alpha(T)\setminus C|\leq1 for some conic C.
