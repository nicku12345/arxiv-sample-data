We study whether the basin of attraction of a sequence of automorphisms of \mathbb{C}^k is biholomorphic to \mathbb{C}^k. In particular we show that given any sequence of automorphisms with the same attracting fixed point, the basin is biholomorphic to \mathbb{C}^k if the maps are repeated often enough. We also construct Fatou-Bieberbach domains whose boundaries are 4-dimensional.
