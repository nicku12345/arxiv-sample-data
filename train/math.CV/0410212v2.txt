We show that for any m\in\NN\cup\{\infty\} there exist m disjoint FB domains whose union is dense in \CC^k. In fact we show that any point not in the union is a boundary point for all the domains. We construct FB domains that contains arbitrary countable collections of subvarieties of \CC^k, and we construct FB domains that intersect elements of countable collections of affine subspaces of \CC^k in connected proper subsets. Moreover, we show that any Runge FB domain is the attracting basin for a sequence of automorphisms of \CC^k, although not necessarily if you only allow iteration of one automorphism. We also show that an increasing sequence of Runge \CC^k's is a \CC^k.
