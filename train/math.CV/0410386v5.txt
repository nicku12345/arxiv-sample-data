We explore connections between geometric properties of the Levi foliation of a Levi-flat hypersurface M and holomorphic convexity of compact sets in M, or bounded in part by M. Applications include extendability of Cauchy-Riemann functions, solvability of the dibar_b-equation, approximability of holomorphic and CR functions, and global regularity of the dibar-Neumann operator.
