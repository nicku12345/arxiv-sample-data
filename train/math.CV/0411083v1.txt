A question of Poletsky was to know if there exists a thin Hartogs figure such that any of its neighborhoods cannot be imbedded in Stein spaces. In \cite{chirka}, Chirka and Ivashkovitch gave such an example arising in an open complex manifold. In this paper, we answer to the question of the existence of such a figure in compact surfaces by giving an example arising in P_2(\mathbb{C}). By smoothing it, we obtain a smooth (non analytic) disc with boundary \bar{D} \subset P_2(\mathbb{C}) having the same property. Consequently, this disc intersects all algebraic curves of P_2(\mathbb{C}). Moreover, as \bar D is topologically trivial, it has a neighborhood diffeomorphic to the unit ball of \mathbb{C}^2. This gives a negative answer to the following question of S. Ivashkovitch: Is the property for a domain B of P_2(\mathbb{C}) to be diffeormorphic to the unit ball of \mathbb{C}^2 a sufficient condition for the existence of non-constant holomorphic functions on it?
