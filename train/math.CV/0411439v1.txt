The density property for a Stein manifold X implies that the group of holomorphic diffeomorphisms of X is infinite-dimensional and, in a certain well-defined sense, as large as possible.   We prove that if G is a complex semisimple Lie group of adjoint type and K is a reductive subgroup, then G/K has the density property. This theorem is a non-trivial extension of an earlier result of ours, which handles the case of complex semi-simple Lie groups. We also establish the density property for some other complex homogeneous spaces by ad hoc methods. Finally, we introduce a lifting method that extends many results on complex manifolds with the density property to covering spaces of such manifolds.
