Let M be a smooth generic submanifold of C^n. Tumanov showed that the direction of CR extendability parallel propagates with respect to a certain differential geometric partial connection in a quotient bundle of the normal bundle to M. M is said to be globally minimal at a point z in M if the CR orbit of z contains a neighborhood of z in M. It is shown that the vector space generated by the directions of CR-extendability of CR functions on M is preserved by the induced composed flow between two points in the same CR orbit. As an application, the main result of this paper, conjectured by J.-M. Trepreau in 1990, is established: for wedge extendability of CR functions to hold at every point in the CR-orbit of z M, it is sufficient that M be globally minimal at z.
