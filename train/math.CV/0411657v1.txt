Let D\subset \C^n, G\subset \C^m be pseudoconvex domains, let A (resp. B) be an open subset of the boundary \partial D (resp.   \partial G) and let X be the 2-fold cross ((D\cup A)\times B)\cup (A\times(B\cup G)).   Suppose in addition that the domain D (resp. G) is {\it locally \mathcal{C}^2 smooth on A} (resp. B). We shall determine the "envelope of holomorphy" \hat{X} of X in the sense that any function continuous on X and separately holomorphic on (A\times G) \cup (D\times B) extends to a function continuous on \hat{X} and holomorphic on the interior of \hat{X}. A generalization of this result for an N-fold cross is also given.
