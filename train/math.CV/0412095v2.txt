We study some special almost complex structures on strictly pseudoconvex domains. They appear naturally as limits under a nonisotroping scaling procedure and play a role of model objects in the geometry of almost complex manifolds with boundary. As applications we prove a boundary extension and a compactness principle for some elliptic diffeomorphisms between relatively compact domains.
