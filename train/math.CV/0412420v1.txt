It is well-known that the automorphism group of a hyperbolic manifold is a Lie group.Conversely, it is interesting to see whether or not any Lie group could be prescribed asthe automorphism group of certain complex manifold. Whenthe Lie group G is compact and connected, this problem has been completelysolved by Bedford-Dadok and independently by Saerens-Zame on 1987. Theyhave constructed \spc bounded domains \Omega such that Aut(\Omega)=G. For Bedford-Dadok's \Omega, 0\le dim_{\Bbb C}\Omega- dim_{\Bbb R}G\le 1; for generic Saerens-Zame's\Omega,dim_{\Bbb C}\Omega \gg dim_{\Bbb R}G.J. Winkelmann has answered affirmatively to noncompact connected Liegroups in recent years. He showed there exist Stein complete hyperbolic manifolds \Omega such that Aut(\Omega)=G.In his construction, it is typical that dim_{\Bbb C}\Omega\gg dim_{\Bbb R}G.In this article, we tackle this problem from a different aspect. We provethat for any connected Lie group G (compact or noncompact), there exist completehyperbolic Stein manifolds \Omega such that Aut(\Omega)=G with dim_{\BbbC}\Omega=dim_{\Bbb R}G. Working on a natural complexification of the real-analyticmanifold G, our construction of \Omega is geometrically concrete andelementary in nature.
