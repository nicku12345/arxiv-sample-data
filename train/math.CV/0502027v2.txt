Let \cP_n be the complex vector space of all polynomials of degree at most n. We give several characterizations of the linear operators T\in\cL(\cP_n) for which there exists a constant C > 0 such that for all nonconstant p\in\cP_n there exist a root u of p and a root v of Tp with |u-v|\leq C. We prove that such perturbations leave the degree unchanged and, for a suitable pairing of the roots of p and Tp, the roots are never displaced by more than a uniform constant independent on p. We show that such ``good'' operators T are exactly the invertible elements of the commutative algebra generated by the differentiation operator. We provide upper bounds in terms of T for the relevant constants.
