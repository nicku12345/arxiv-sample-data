Let M be a two dimensional complex manifold, p \in M  and \Fl a germ of holomorphic foliation of \M at p. Let S\subset M be a germ of an irreducible, possibly singular, curve at p in M which is a separatrix for \Fl. We prove that if the Camacho-Sad-Suwa index \id(\F,S,p)\not \in \Q^+\cup \{0\}  then there exists another separatrix for \Fl at p. A similar result is proved for the existence of parabolic curves for germs of holomorphic diffeomorphisms near a curve of fixed points.
