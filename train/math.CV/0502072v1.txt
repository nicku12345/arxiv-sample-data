In the study of holomorphic functions of one complex variable, one well-known theory is that of elliptic functions and it is possible to take the zeta-function of Weierstrass as a building stone of this vast theory. We are working the analogue theory in the natural context of higher dimensional spaces : holomorphic and elliptic Cliffordian functions.
