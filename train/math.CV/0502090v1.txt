In classical function theory, a function is holomorphic if and only if it is complex analytic. For higher dimensional spaces it is natural to work in the context of Clifford algebras. The structures of these algebras depend on the parity of the dimension n of the underlying vector space. The theory of holomorphic Cliffordian functions reflects this dependence. In the case of odd n the space of functions is defined by an operator (the Cauchy-Riemann equation) but not in the case of even n. For all dimensions the powers of identity (z^n, x^n) are the foundation of function theory.
