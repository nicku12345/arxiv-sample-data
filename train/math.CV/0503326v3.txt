Let X, Y be two complex manifolds of dimension 1 which are countable at infinity, let D\subset X,  G\subset Y be two open sets, let A (resp. B) be a subset of \partial D (resp. \partial G), and let W be the 2-fold cross ((D\cup A)\times B)\cup (A\times(B\cup G)). Suppose in addition that D (resp. G) is {\it Jordan-curve-like on A} (resp. B) and that A and B are {\it of positive length}. We determine the "envelope of holomorphy" \hat{W} of W in the sense that any function locally bounded on W, measurable on A\times B, and separately holomorphic on (A\times G) \cup (D\times B) "extends" to a function holomorphic on the interior of \hat{W}.
