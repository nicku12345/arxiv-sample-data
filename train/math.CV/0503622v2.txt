Let \phi(z)=(\phi_1(z), ...,\phi_n(z)) be a holomorphic self-map of U^n and \psi(z) a holomorphic function on U^n, where U^n is the unit polydisk of {\Bbb C}^n. Let p\geq 0, q\geq 0, this paper gives some necessary and sufficient conditions for the weighted composition operator W_{\psi,\phi} induced by \psi and \phi to be bounded and compact between p-Bloch space {\cal B}^p(U^n) and q-Bloch space {\cal B}^q(U^n).
