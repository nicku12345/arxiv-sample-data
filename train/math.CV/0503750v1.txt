We study Picard's exceptional values of holomorphic one-parametric families of entire functions. Our first result shows that the set of parameter values for which zero is a Picard value can be an arbitrary closed set of zero logarithmic capacity. This answers a question of Julia. Second, we show that if a function has a Picard exceptional value for all values of parameter in some region of the plane then this Picard value is a holomorphic function in the complement of some discrete set E, tending to infinity as the papameter tends to E.
