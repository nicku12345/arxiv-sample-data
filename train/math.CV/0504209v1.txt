This survey is about irreducibility for germs of a holomorphic functions f. I will show that when the dimension of the domain U of this holomorphic function f is greater than 2, the irreducibility of germs are not necessary to be stable. That means, if the germ of f at point p is irreducible in the stalk of holomorphic functions at p, this does NOT means there exists an open neighborhood V\subset U of this point p, such that for any point q\in V, the germ of f at q is irreducible at the stalk of holomorphic functions at q
