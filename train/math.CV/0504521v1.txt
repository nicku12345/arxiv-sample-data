We give a holomorphic extension result from non generic CR submanifold of \C^L of positive CR dimension. We consider N a non generic CR submanifold given by N=\{\n,h(\n)\} where \n is a generic submanifold of some \C^{\ell} and h is a CR map from \n into \C^n. We prove that if \n is a hypersurface then any CR distribution on N extends holomorphically to a complex transversal wedge, we then generalize this result for arbitrary \n in the case where the graphing function h is decomposable at some p'\in \n. We show that any CR distribution on N that is decomposable at p=(p',h(p')) extends holomorphically to a complex transversal wedge.
