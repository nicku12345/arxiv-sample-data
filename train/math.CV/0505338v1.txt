We prove non-subelliptic estimates for the tangential Cauchy-Riemann system over a weakly "q-pseudoconvex" higher codimensional submanifold M of \C^n. Let us point out that our hypotheses do not suffice to guarantee subelliptic estimates, in general. Even more: hypoellipticity of the tangential C-R system is not in question (as shows the example by Kohn in case of a Levi-flat hypersurface). However our estimates suffice for existence of smooth solutions to the inhomogeneous C-R equations in certain degree.   The main ingredients in our proofs are the weighted L^2 estimates by H\"ormander and Kohn and the tangential \bar\partial-Neumann operator by Kohn. As for the notion of q pseudoconvexity we follow closely Zampieri. The main technical result is a version for "perturbed" q-pseudoconvex domains of a similar result by Ahn who generalizes in turn Chen-Shaw.
