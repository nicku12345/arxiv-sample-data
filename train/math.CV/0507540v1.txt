In this paper we establish results on the existence of nontangential limits for weighted \Cal A-harmonic functions in the weighted Sobolev space W_w^{1,q}(\Bbb B^n), for some q>1 and w in the Muckenhoupt A_q class, where \Bbb B^n is the unit ball in \Bbb R^n. These results generalize the ones in section \S3 of [KMV], where the weight was identically equal to one.   Weighted \Cal A-harmonic functions are weak solutions of the partial differential equation \text{div}(\Cal A(x,\nabla u))=0, where \alpha w(x) |\xi|^{q} \le < \Cal A(x,\xi),\xi >\le \beta w(x) |\xi|^{q} for some fixed q\in (1,\infty), where 0<\alpha\leq \beta<\infty, and w(x) is a q-admissible weight as in Chapter 1 in [HKM].   Later, we apply these results to improve on results of Koskela, Manfredi and Villamor [KMV] and Martio and Srebro [MS] on the existence of radial limits for bounded quasiregular mappings in the unit ball of \Bbb R^n with some growth restriction on their multiplicity function.
