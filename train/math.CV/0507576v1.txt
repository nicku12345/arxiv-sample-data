Let F\in W_{loc}^{1,n}(\Omega;\Bbb R^n) be a mapping with non-negative Jacobian J_F(x)=\text{det} DF(x)\ge 0 a.e. in a domain \Omega\in \Bbb R^n. The dilatation of the mapping F is defined, almost everywhere in \Omega, by the formula K(x)={{|DF(x)|^n}\over {J_F(x)}}. If K(x) is bounded a.e., the mapping is said to be quasiregular. Quasiregular mappings are a generalization to higher dimensions of holomorphic mappings. The theory of higher dimensional quasiregular mappings began with Re\v{s}hetnyak's theorem, stating that non constant quasiregular mappings are continuous, discrete and open.   In some problems appearing in the theory of non-linear elasticity, the boundedness condition on K(x) is too restrictive. Tipically we only know that F has finite dilatation, that is, K(x) is finite a.e. and K(x)^p is integrable for some value p. In two dimensions, Iwaniec and \v{S}verak [IS] have shown that K(x)\in L^1_{loc} is sufficient to guarantee the conclusion of Re\v{s}hetnyak's theorem.   For n\ge 3, Heinonen and Koskela [HK], showed that if the mapping is quasi-light and K(x)\in L^p_{loc} for p>n-1, then the mapping F(x) is continuous, discrete and open. Manfredi and Villamor [MV] proved a similar result without assuming that the mapping f(x) was quasi-light. The result is known to be false, see [Ball], when p<n-1.   In this paper we attempt to improve in those results. In particular, we will deal with the case p=n-1 for n\ge 3, and will assume that our mapping F(x) is quasi-light, that is, the inverse image of any point is compact in \Omega.   Our approach will be different from the ones used in [MV] and [HK]. It is more geometrical in nature and uses the method of extremal length.
