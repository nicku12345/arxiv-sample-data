We develop classes of one-parameter families (OPF) of operators on C^\infty_c(\mathbb{C}) which characterize the behavior of operators associated to the \bar\partial-problem in L^2(\mathbb{C},e^{-2p}) where p is a subharmonic, nonharmonic polynomial. We prove that an order 0 OPF operator extends to a bounded operator from L^q(\mathbb{C}) to itself, 1<q<\infty, with a bound that depends on q and the degree of p but not on the parameter \tau or the coefficients of p. Last, we show that there is a one-to-one correspondence given by the partial Fourier transform in \tau between OPF operators of order m\leq 2 and nonisotropic smoothing (NIS) operators of order m\leq 2 on polynomial models in \mathbb{C}^2.
