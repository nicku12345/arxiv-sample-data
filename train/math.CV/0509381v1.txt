Let G be a finitely generated Kleinian group and let \Delta be an invariant collection of components in its region of discontinuity. The Teichm\"uller space T(\Delta,G) supported in \Delta, is the space of equivalence classes of quasiconformal homeomorphisms with complex dilatation invariant under G and supported in \Delta. In this paper we propose a partial closure of T(\Delta,G) by considering certain deformations of the above homeomorphisms. Such a partial closure is denoted by NT(\Delta,G) and called the {\it noded Teichm\"uller space} of G supported in \Delta. Some concrete examples are discussed.
