We show that the holomorphic ideal sheaf of a linear section of a pseudoconvex open subset \Omega of, say, a Hilbert space X=\ell_2 is acyclic.   We also prove an analog of Hefer's lemma, i.e., if f:\Omega\times\Omega\to\CC is holomorphic and f(x,x)=0 for x\in\Omega, then there is a holomorphic g:\Omega\times\Omega\to X^* with values in the dual space X^* of X such that f(x,y)=g(x,y)(x-y)
