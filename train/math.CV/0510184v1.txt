Given N a non generic smooth CR submanifold of \C^L, N=\{(\n,h(\n))\} where \n is generic in \C^{L-n} and h is a CR map from \n into \C^n. We prove, using only elementary tools, that if h is decomposable at p'\in \n then any decomposable CR distribution on N at p=(p',h(p')) extends holomorphically to a complex transversal wedge. This gives an elementary proof of the well known equivalent for totally real non generic submanifolds, i.e if N is a smooth totally real submanifold of \C^L any continuous function on N admits a holomorphic extension to a complex transverse wedge
