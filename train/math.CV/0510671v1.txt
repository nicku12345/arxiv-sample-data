Let u be a plurisubharmonic function, defined on a neighbourhood of a point x, such that the complex Monge-Amp\`ere operator is well-defined on u. Suppose also that u has a weak singularity, in the sense that the Lelong number of u at x vanish. Is it true that the residual mass of the measure (dd^c{u})^n vanish at x?   To our knowledge there is no known example that falsifies the posed question. In this paper some partial results are obtained. We find that for a significant subset of plurisubharmonic functions with well defined Monge-Amp\`ere mass vanishing Lelong number does implies vanishing residual mass of the Monge-Amp\`ere measure.
