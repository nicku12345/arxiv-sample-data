In the present paper, the coefficient estimates are found for the class \mathcal S^{*-1}(\alpha) consisting of inverses of functions in the class of univalent starlike functions of order \alpha in \mathcal D=\{z\in\mathbb C:|z|<1\}. These estimates extend the work of {\it Krzyz, Libera and Zlotkiewicz [Ann. Univ. Marie Curie-Sklodowska, 33(1979), 103-109]} who found sharp estimates on only first two coefficients for the functions in the class \mathcal S^{*-1}(\alpha). The coefficient estimates are also found for the class \sum^{*-1}(\alpha), consisting of inverses of functions in the class \sum^*(\alpha) of univalent starlike functions of order \alpha in \mathcal V=\{z\in\mathbb C:1<|z|<\infty\}. The open problem of finding sharp coefficient estimates for functions in the class \sum^*(\alpha) stands completely settled in the present work by our method developed here.
