Non-existence theorems for Levi flat hypersurfaces have found great interest in the literature. The question next to this that has to be asked is, when existing Levi flat hypersurfaces are at least rigid under deformations. Here, the case of boundaries of disc bundles over certain compact Riemann surfaces is considered.
