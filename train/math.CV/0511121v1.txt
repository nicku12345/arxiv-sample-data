A discussion of methods of nonisotropic fine quantitative complex analysis on lineally convex domains of finite type is given. The needed support functions with best possible estimates are considered together with the estimation of their corresponding Leray sections with respect to nonisotropic pseudodistances. The most recent developments in this subject are studied and open questions listed.
