Given a Stein manifold X of dimension n>1, a discrete sequence a_j in X, and a discrete sequence b_j in C^m where m > [3n/2], there exists a proper holomorphic embedding of X into C^m which sends a_j to b_j for every j=1,2,.... This is the interpolation version of the embedding theorem due to Eliashberg, Gromov and Schurmann. The dimension m cannot be lowered in general due to an example of Forster.
