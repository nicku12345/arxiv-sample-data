Given a coherent ideal sheaf J we construct locally a vector-valued residue current R whose annihilator is precisely the given sheaf. In case J is a complete intersection, R is just the classical Coleff-Herrera product. By means of these currents we can extend various results, previously known for a complete intersection, to general ideal sheaves. Combining with integral formulas we obtain a residue version of the Ehrenpreis-Palamodov fundamental principle.
