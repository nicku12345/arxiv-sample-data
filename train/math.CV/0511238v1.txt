Let f be a r\times m-matrix of holomorphic functions that is generically surjective. We provide explicit integral representation of holomorphic \psi such that \phi=f\psi, provided that \phi is holomorphic and annihilates a certain residue current with support on the set where f is not surjective. We also consider formulas for interpolation. As applications we obtain generalizations of various results previously known for the case r=1.
