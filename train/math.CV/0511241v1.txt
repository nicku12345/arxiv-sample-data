Given a generically surjective holomorphic vector bundle morphism f\colon E\to Q, E and Q Hermitian bundles, we construct a current R^f with values in \Hom(Q,H), where H is a certain derived bundle, and with support on the set Z where f is not surjective. The main property is that if \phi is a holomorphic section of Q, and R^f\phi=0, then locally f\psi=\phi has a holomorphic solution \psi. In the generic case also the converse holds. This gives a generalization of the corresponding theorem for a complete intersection, due to Dickenstein-Sessa and Passare. We also present results for polynomial mappings, related to M Noether's theorem and the effective Nullstellensatz. The construction of the current is based on a generalization of the Koszul complex. By means of this complex one can also obtain new global estimates of solutions to f\psi=\phi, and as an example we give new results related to the H^p-corona problem.
