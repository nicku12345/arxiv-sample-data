With a given holomorphic section of a Hermitian vector bundle, one can associate a residue current by means of Cauchy-Fantappi\`e-Leray type formulas. In this paper we define products of such residue currents. We prove that, in the case of a complete intersection, the product of the residue currents of a tuple of sections coincides with the residue current of the direct sum of the sections.
