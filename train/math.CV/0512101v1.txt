In this paper we study the function algebra generated by z^2 and g^2 on a small closed disk centered at the origin of the complex plane. We prove, using a biholomorphic change of coordinates and already developed techniques in this area, that for a large class of functions g this algebra consists of all continuous functions on the disk.
