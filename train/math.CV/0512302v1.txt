A new proof of the Second Main Theorem with truncation level 1 for Zariski-dense holomorphic curves into Abelian varieties, which has just been proved by Yamanoi [Y2], is presented. Our proof is based on the idea of the "Radon transform" introduced in [K2] combined with consideration on certain singular perturbation of the probability measures on the parameter space which appears in the "Radon transform".
