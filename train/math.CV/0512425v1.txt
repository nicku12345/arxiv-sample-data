For a scale of spaces X of functions analytic in the unit disc, including the Korenblum space, and for some natural families \mathcal E of uniqueness subsets for X, we describe minorants for (X,\mathcal E), that is non-decreasing functions M:(0,1)\to(0,\infty) such that f\in X, E\in\mathcal E, and \log|f(z)|\le -M(|z|) on E imply f=0. We give an application of this result to approximation by simple fractions with restrictions on the coefficients.
