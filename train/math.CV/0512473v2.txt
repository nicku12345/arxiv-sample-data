We give a formula for the Caratheodory distance on the Neile parabola, the variety {z^2=w^3} restricted to the bidisk; thus making it the first variety with a singularity to have its Caratheodory distance explicitly computed. In addition, we relate this to a mixed Caratheodory-Pick interpolation problem for which known interpolation theorems do not apply. Finally, we prove a bounded holomorphic function extension result from the Neile parabola to the bidisk.
