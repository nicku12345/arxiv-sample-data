There is a universal constant 0<r_0<1 with the following property. Suppose that f is an analytic function on the unit disk \D, and suppose that there exists a constant M>0 so that the Euclidean area, counting multiplicity, of the portion of f(\D) which lies over the disk D(f(0),M), centered at f(0) and of radius M, is strictly less than the area of D(f(0),M). Then f must send r_0\bar{\D} into D(f(0),M). This answers a conjecture of Don Marshall.
