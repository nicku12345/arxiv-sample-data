Let X be a holomorphically separable irreducible reduced complex space, K a connected compact Lie group acting on X by holomorphic transformations, theta : K -> K a Weyl involution, and mu : X -> X an antiholomorphic involution map satisfying mu(kx) = theta(k) mu(x) for x in X and k in K. We show that if the holomorphic functions on X form a multiplicity free K-module then mu maps every K-orbit onto itself. For a spherical affine homogeneous space X=G/H of the reductive group G (the complexification of K) we construct an antiholomorphic map mu with these properties.
