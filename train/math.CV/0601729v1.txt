Let D be a convex domain in the plane. Let a_k be summable positive constants and let each z_k lie in D. If the z_k converge sufficiently rapidly to a boundary point of D from within an appropriate Stolz angle then the function f(z) = \sum_{k=1}^\infty a_k /(z - z_k) has infinitely many zeros in D. An example shows that the hypotheses on the z_k are not redundant, and that two recently advanced conjectures are false.
