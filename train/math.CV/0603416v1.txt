We prove that a pseudoholomorphic diffeomorphism between two almost complex manifolds with boundaries satisfying some pseudoconvexity type condition cannot map a pseudoholomorphic disc in the boundary to a single point. This can be viewed as an almost complex analogue of a well-known theorem of J. E. Fornaess.
