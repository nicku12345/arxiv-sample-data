We prove that a relatively compact pseudoconvex domain with smooth boundary in an almost complex manifold admits a bounded strictly plurisubharmonic exhaustion function. We use this result for the study of convexity and hyperbolicity properties of these domains and the contact geometry of their boundaries.
