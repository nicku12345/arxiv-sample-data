For a quasi-Fuchsian group \Ga with ordinary set \Omega, and \Delta_{n} the Laplacian on \n differentials on \Ga\bk\Omega, we define a notion of a Bers dual basis \phi_{1},...c,\phi_{2d} for \ker\Delta_{n}. We prove that \det\Delta_{n}/\det <\phi_{j},\phi_{k}>, is, up to an anomaly computed by Takhtajan and the second author in \cite{TT1}, the modulus squared of a holomorphic function F(n), where F(n) is a quasi-Fuchsian analogue of the Selberg zeta Z(n). This generalizes the D'Hoker-Phong formula \det\Delta_{n}=c_{g,n}Z(n), and is a quasi-Fuchsian counterpart of the result for Schottky groups proved by Takhtajan and the first author in \cite{MT}.
