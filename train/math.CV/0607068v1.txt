We investigate the relationship between the univalence of f and of h in the decomposition f=h+\bar{g} of a sense-preserving harmonic mapping defined in the unit disk \mathbb{D}\subset\mathbb{C}. Among other results, we determine the holomorphic univalent maps h for which there exists c>0 such that every harmonic mapping of the form f=h+\bar{g} with |g'|< c|h'| is univalent. The notion of a linearly connected domain appears in our study in a relevant way.
