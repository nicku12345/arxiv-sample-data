Let M, M' be smooth, real analytic hypersurfaces of finite type in {\mbf C^n} and \h f a holomorphic correspondence (not necessarily proper) that is defined on one side of M, extends continuously up to M and maps M to M'. It is shown that \h f must extend across M as a locally proper holomorphic correspondence. This is a version for correspondences of the Diederich--Pinchuk extension result for CR maps.
