It is an observation due to J.J. Kohn that for a smooth bounded pseudoconvex domain D in C^n there exists s>0 such that the dbar-Neumann operator on D maps W^s_{(0,1)}(D) (the space of (0,1)-forms with coefficient functions in L^2-Sobolev space of order s) into itself continuously. We show that this conclusion does not hold without the smoothness assumption by constructing a bounded pseudoconvex domain D in C^2, smooth except at one point, whose dbar-Neumann operator is not bounded on W^s_{(0,1)}(D) for any s>0.
