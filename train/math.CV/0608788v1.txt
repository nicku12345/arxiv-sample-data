Let f_1, f_2, and f_3 be holomorphic functions on a complex manifold and assume that the common zero set of the f_j has maximal codimension, i.e., that it is a complete intersection. We prove that the iterated Mellin transform of the residue integral has an analytic continuation to a neighborhood of the origin in \mathbb{C}^3. We prove also that the natural regularization of the residue current converges unrestrictedly.
