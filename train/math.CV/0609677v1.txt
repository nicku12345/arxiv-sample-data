It is shown that a germ of a holomorphic mapping sending a real-analytic generic submanifold of finite type into another is determined by its projection on the Segre variety of the target manifold. A necessary and sufficient condition is given for a germ of a mapping into the Segre variety of the target manifold to be the projection of a holomorphic mapping sending the source manifold into the target. An application to the biholomorphic equivalence problem is also given.
