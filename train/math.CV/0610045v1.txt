In this paper we shall consider the assymptotic growth of |P_n(z)|^{1/k_n} where P_n(z) is a sequence of entire functions of genus zero. Our results extend a result of J. Muller and A. Yavrian. We shall prove that if the sequence of entire functions has a geometric growth at each point in a set E being non-thin at \infty then it has a geometric growth in \CC also. Moreover, if E has some more properties, a similar result also holds for a more general kind of growth. Even in the case where P_n are polynomials, our results are new in the sense that it does not require k_n\succeq deg(P_n) as usually required.
