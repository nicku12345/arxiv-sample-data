An application of the Zalcman renormalization theorem to harmonic functions shows that the limit functions are nonconstant affine. Extensions of this method are given for maps with values in a torus or in a complex Lie groups. As an application, we give criteria of Kobayashi hyperbolicity for tubes in {\Bbb C}^2.
