We present a method of finding weighted Koppelman formulas for (p,q)-forms on n-dimensional complex manifolds X which admit a vector bundle of rank n over X \times X, such that the diagonal of X \times X has a defining section. We apply the method to \Pn and find weighted Koppelman formulas for (p,q)-forms with values in a line bundle over \Pn. As an application, we look at the cohomology groups of (p,q)-forms over \Pn with values in various line bundles, and find explicit solutions to the \dbar-equation in some of the trivial groups. We also look at cohomology groups of (0,q)-forms over \Pn \times \Pm with values in various line bundles. Finally, we apply our method to developing weighted Koppelman formulas on Stein manifolds.
