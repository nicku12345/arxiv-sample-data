There has been a great deal of work done in recent years on weighted Bergman spaces \apa on the unit ball \bn of \cn, where 0<p<\infty and \alpha>-1. We extend this study in a very natural way to the case where \alpha is {\em any} real number and 0<p\le\infty. This unified treatment covers all classical Bergman spaces, Besov spaces, Lipschitz spaces, the Bloch space, the Hardy space H^2, and the so-called Arveson space. Some of our results about integral representations, complex interpolation, coefficient multipliers, and Carleson measures are new even for the ordinary (unweighted) Bergman spaces of the unit disk.
