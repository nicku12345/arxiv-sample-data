We obtain new characterizations for Bergman spaces with standard weights in terms of Lipschitz type conditions in the Euclidean, hyperbolic, and pseudo-hyperbolic metrics. As a consequence, we prove optimal embedding theorems when an analytic function on the unit disk is symmetrically lifted to the bidisk.
