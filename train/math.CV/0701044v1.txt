Let E be a subset of the unit disc U of the complex plane \CC. Recall that H^p(U) is the space of all holomorphic functions g on U for which \|g\|_{H^p} < \infty. Put \begin{equation} C_p(\epsilon, R) = \sup \{\sup_{|z| \leq R}|g(z)|: g\in H^p, \|g\|_p\leq 1, |g(\zeta)| \leq \epsilon \forall \zeta\in E\}, \end{equation} for positive \epsilon and R in (0, 1). It can be seen that C_p(\epsilon, R) is bounded from above by (1-R^2)^{-1/p}.   \begin{theorem} If \bar E \subset U then there exists \epsilon_0>0 such that for 0<\epsilon <\epsilon_0 there is correspondingly a finite Blaschke product B_{\epsilon}(z) whose zeros are in \bar E satisfying \begin{eqnarray*} \max_{|z|\leq R}|B_\epsilon (z)|\leq C_p(\epsilon, R)\leq C\max_{|z|\leq R}|B_\epsilon (z)|^{1/2}, \end{eqnarray*} where C is a positive constant that depends only on R and p. Moreover we have \begin{eqnarray*} \sup_{z\in E}|B_{\epsilon}(z)|\leq \epsilon. \end{eqnarray*} \end{theorem}
