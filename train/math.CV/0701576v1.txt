We present some results dealing with the local geometry of almost complex manifolds. We establish mainly the complete hyperbolicity of strictly pseudoconvex domains, the extension of plurisubharmonic functions through generic submanifolds and the elliptic regularity of some diffeomorphisms in almost complex manifolds with boundary.
