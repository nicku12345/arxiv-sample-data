We prove that to each almost periodic (in the sense of distributions) divisor in a tube one can assign a first Chern class of a special line bundle over Bohr's compact set generated by the divisor such that the trivial cohomology class represents divisors of all almost periodic holomorphic functions on a tube. This description yields various geometric conditions for an almost periodic divisor to be the divisor of a holomorphic almost periodic function. We also give a complete description for the divisors of homogeneous coordinates for holomorphic almost periodic curves; in particular, we obtain a description for the divisors of meromorphic almost periodic functions.
