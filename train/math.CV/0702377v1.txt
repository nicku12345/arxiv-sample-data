We obtain a generalization of the Burns-Krantz rigidity theorem for holomorphic self-mappings of the unit disk in the spirit of the classical Schwarz-Pick Lemma and its continuous version due to L.Harris via the generation theory for one-parameter semigroups. In particular, we establish geometric and analytic criteria for a holomorphic function on the disk with a boundary null point to be a generator of a semigroup of linear fractional transformations under some relations between three boundary derivatives of the function at this point.
