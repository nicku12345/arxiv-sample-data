The Leau-Fatou flower theorem completely describes the dynamic behavior of 1-dimensional maps tangent to the identity. In dimension two Hakim and Abate proved that if f is a holomorphic map tangent to the identity in \mathbb{C}^2 and \nu(f) is the degree of the first non vanishing jet of f-Id then there exist \nu(f)-1 robust parabolic curves (RP curves for short), namely attractive petals at the origin which survive under by blow-up. The set of the exponential of holomorphic vector fields (of order greater than or equal to two), \Phi_{\geq 2}(\mathbb{C}^2,0), is dense in the space of germs of maps tangent to the identity. In this paper we give an upper-bound for the number of robust parabolic curves of f\in \Phi_{\geq 2}(\mathbb{C}^2,0) .
