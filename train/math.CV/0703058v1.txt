We give an explicit verifiable characterization of weakly pseudoconvex but locally nonconvexifiable hypersurfaces of finite type in dimension two. It is expressed in terms of a generalized model, which captures local geometry of the hypersurface both in the complex tangential and nontangential directions. As an application we obtain a new class of nonconvexifiable pseudoconvex hypersurfaces with convex models.
