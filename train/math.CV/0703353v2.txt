The present notes originated in the introductory course given at the Trieste Summer School on Resolution of Singularities, in June 2006. They focus on the resolution of complex analytic curves and surfaces by Jung's method. They do not contain detailed proofs, but mainly explanations of the main concepts and of their interrelations, as well as heuristics.
