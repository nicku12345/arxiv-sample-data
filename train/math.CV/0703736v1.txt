Using recent development in Poletsky theory of discs, we prove the following result:   Let X, Y be two complex manifolds, let Z be a complex analytic space which possesses the Hartogs extension property, let A (resp. B) be a non locally pluripolar subset of X (resp. Y).   We show that every separately holomorphic mapping   f: W:=(A\times Y) \cup (X\times B)\longrightarrow Z extends to a holomorphic mapping \hat{f} on \hat{W}:=\left\lbrace(z,w)\in X\times Y:\ \widetilde{\omega}(z,A,X)+\widetilde{\omega}(w,B,Y)<1 \right\rbrace such that \hat{f}=f on W\cap \hat{W}, where \widetilde{\omega}(\cdot,A,X) (resp. \widetilde{\omega}(\cdot,B,Y)) is the plurisubharmonic measure of A (resp. B) relative to X (resp. Y).   Generalizations of this result for an N-fold cross are also given.
