Let D\subset \C^n, G\subset \C^m be open sets, let   A (resp. B) be a subset of the boundary \partial D (resp.   \partial G) and let W be the 2-fold boundary cross ((D\cup A)\times B)\cup (A\times(B\cup G)).   An open subset X\subset\C^{n+m}  is said to be the ``envelope of holomorphy" of W if it is, in some sense, the maximal open set with the following property: Any function locally bounded on W and separately holomorphic on (A\times G) \cup (D\times B) "extends" to a holomorphic function defined on X which admits the boundary values f a.e. on W. In this work we will determine the envelope of holomorphy of some boundary crosses.
