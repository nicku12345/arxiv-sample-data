We find identities between theta constants with rational characteristics evaluated at period matrix of R, a cyclic 3 sheeted cover of the sphere with 3k branch points \lambda_1...\lambda_{3k}. These identities follow from Thomae formula \cite{BR}. This formula expresses powers of theta constants as polynomials in \lambda_1...\lambda_{3k}. We apply the representation of the symmetric group to find relations between the polynomials and hence between the associated theta constants.
