Let V be a complex linear space, G\subset\GL(V) be a compact group. We consider the problem of description of polynomial hulls \wh{Gv} for orbits Gv, v\in V, assuming that the identity component of G is a torus T. The paper contains a universal construction for orbits which satisfy the inclusion Gv\subset T^\bbC v and a characterization of pairs (G,V) such that it is true for a generic v\in V. The hull of a finite union of T-orbits in T^\bbC v can be distinguished in \clos T^\bbC v by a finite collection of inequalities of the type \abs{z_1}^{s_1}...\abs{z_n}^{s_n}\leq c. In particular, this is true for Gv. If powers in the monomials are independent of v, Gv\subset T^\bbC v for a generic v, and either the center of G is finite or T^\bbC has an open orbit, then the space V and the group G are products of standard ones; the latter means that G=S_nT, where S_n is the group of all permutations of coordinates and T is either \bbT^n or \SU(n)\cap\bbT^n, where \bbT^n is the torus of all diagonal matrices in \rU(n). The paper also contains a description of polynomial hulls for orbits of isotropy groups of bounded symmetric domains. This result is already known, but we formulate it in a different form and supply with a shorter proof.
