Harvey and Lawson introduced the Kaehler rank and computed it in connection to the cone of positive exact currents of bidimension (1,1) for many classes of compact complex surfaces. In this paper we extend these computations to the only further known class of surfaces not considered by them, that of Kato surfaces. Our main tool is the reduction to the dynamics of associated holomorphic contractions.
