Let D and G be copies of the open unit disc in \C, let   A (resp. B) be a measurable subset of \partial D (resp.   \partial G), let W be the 2-fold cross \big((D\cup A)\times B\big)\cup \big(A\times(B\cup G)\big), and let M be a relatively closed subset of W. Suppose in addition that A and B are of positive one-dimensional Lebesgue measure and that M is fiberwise polar (resp. fiberwise discrete) and that M\cap (A\times B)=\varnothing. We determine the "envelope of holomorphy" \hat{W\setminus M} of W\setminus M in the sense that any function locally bounded on W\setminus M, measurable on A\times B, and separately holomorphic on \big((A\times G) \cup (D\times B)\big)\setminus M "extends" to a function holomorphic on \hat{W\setminus M}.
