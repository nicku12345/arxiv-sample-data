It is proved that CR functions on a quadratic cone M in \C^n, n>1, admit one-sided holomorphic extension if and only if M does not have two-sided support, a geometric condition on M which generalizes minimality in the sense of Tumanov. A biholomorphic classification of quadratic cones in \C^2 is also given.
