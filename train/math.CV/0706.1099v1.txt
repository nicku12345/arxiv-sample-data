Let A^2(D) be the Bergman space over the open unit disk D in the complex plane. Korenblum conjectured that there is an absolute constant c \in (0,1) such that whenever |f(z)|\le |g(z)| in the annulus c<|z|<1 then ||f(z)|| \le ||g(z)||.In 2004 C.Wang gave an upper bound on c,that is, c < 0.67795, and in 2006 A.Schuster gave a lower bound ,c > 0.21  .In this paper we slightly improve the upper bound for c.
