Quantitative estimates are obtained for the (finite) valence of functions analytic in the unit disk with Schwarzian derivative that is bounded or of slow growth. A harmonic mapping is shown to be uniformly locally univalent with respect to the hyperbolic metric if and only if it has finite Schwarzian norm, thus generalizing a result of B. Schwarz for analytic functions. A numerical bound is obtained for the Schwarzian norms of univalent harmonic mappings.
