We prove ratio asymptotic for sequences of multiple orthogonal polynomials with respect to a Nikishin system of measures {\mathcal{N}}(\sigma_1,...,\sigma_m) such that for each k, the support of \sigma_k consists of an interval \widetilde{\Delta}_k, on which \sigma_k^{\prime} > 0 almost everywhere, and a set without accumulation points in \mathbb{R} \setminus \widetilde{\Delta}_k.
