The tetrablock is a domain in 3-dimensional complex space that meets 3-dimensional Euclidean space in a regular tetrahedron. It is shown to be inhomogeneous and its automorphism group is determined. A type of Schwarz lemma for the tetrablock is proved. The action of the automorphism group is described in terms of a certain natural foliation of the tetrablock by complex geodesic discs.
