We study diagonal estimates for the Bergman kernels of certain model domains in \mathbb{C}^2 near boundary points that are of infinite type. To do so, we need a mild structural condition on the defining functions of interest that facilitates optimal upper and lower bounds. This is a mild condition; unlike earlier studies of this sort, we are able to make estimates for non-convex pseudoconvex domains as well. This condition quantifies, in some sense, how flat a domain is at an infinite-type boundary point. In this scheme of quantification, the model domains considered below range -- roughly speaking -- from being ``mildly infinite-type'' to very flat at the infinite-type points.
