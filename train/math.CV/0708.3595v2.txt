In this paper we offer a definition of monogenicity for functions defined on \rr^{n+1} with values in the Clifford algebra \rr_n following an idea inspired by the recent papers \cite{gs}, \cite{advances}. This new class of monogenic functions contains the polynomials (and, more in general, power series) with coefficients in the Clifford algebra \rr_n. We will prove a Cauchy integral formula as well as some of its consequences. Finally, we deal with the zeroes of some polynomials and power series.
