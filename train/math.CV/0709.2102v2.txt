We discuss the relation between pluripolar hulls and fine analytic structure. Our main result is the following. For each non polar subset S of the complex plane \mathbb C we prove that there exists a pluripolar set E \subset (S \times \mathbb C) with the property that the pluripolar hull of E relative to \mathbb C^2 contains no fine analytic structure and its projection onto the first coordinate plane equals \mathbb C.
