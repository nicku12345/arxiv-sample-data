Let \phi be an analytic self-map and u be a fixed analytic function on the open unit disk D in the complex plane \CC. The weighted composition operator is defined\break by \begin{equation*} uC_\phi f =u \cdot (f\circ \phi), f \in H(D). \end{equation*} Weighted composition operators from Bergman-type spaces into Bloch spaces and little Bloch spaces are characterized by function theoretic properties of their inducing maps.
