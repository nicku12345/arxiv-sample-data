We wish to study the problem of bumping outwards a pseudoconvex, finite-type domain \Omega\subset C^n in such a way that pseudoconvexity is preserved and such that the lowest possible orders of contact of the bumped domain with bdy(\Omega), at the site of the bumping, are explicitly realised. Generally, when \Omega\subset C^n, n\geq 3, the known methods lead to bumpings with high orders of contact -- which are not explicitly known either -- at the site of the bumping. Precise orders are known for h-extendible/semiregular domains. This paper is motivated by certain families of non-semiregular domains in C^3. These families are identified by the behaviour of the least-weight plurisubharmonic polynomial in the Catlin normal form. Accordingly, we study how to perturb certain homogeneous plurisubharmonic polynomials without destroying plurisubharmonicity.
