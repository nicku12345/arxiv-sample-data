The Leray transform and related boundary operators are studied for a class of convex Reinhardt domains in \mathbb C^2. Our class is self-dual; it contains some domains with less than C^2-smooth boundary and also some domains with smooth boundary and degenerate Levi form. L^2-regularity is proved, and essential spectra are computed with respect to a family of boundary measures which includes surface measure. A duality principle is established providing explicit unitary equivalence between operators on domains in our class and operators on the corresponding polar domains. Many of these results are new even for the classical case of smoothly bounded strongly convex Reinhardt domains.
