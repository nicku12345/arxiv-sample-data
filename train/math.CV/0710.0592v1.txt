It is known that a subharmonic function of finite order \rho can be approximated by the logarithm of the modulus of an entire function at the point z outside an exceptional set up to C\log|z|. In this article we prove that if such an approximation is made more precise, i. e. a constant   C decreases, then, beginning with C=\rho/4, the size of the exceptional set enlarges substantially. Similar results are proved for subharmonic functions of infinite order and functions subharmonic in the unit disk. These theorems improve and complement a result by Yulmukhametov.
