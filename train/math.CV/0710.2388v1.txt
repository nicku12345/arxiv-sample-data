We explicitly describe germs of strongly pseudoconvex non-spherical real-analytic hypersurfaces M at the origin in \CC^{n+1} for which the group of local CR-automorphisms preserving the origin has dimension d_0(M) equal to either n^2-2n+1 with n\ge 2, or n^2-2n with n\ge 3. The description is given in terms of equations defining hypersurfaces near the origin, written in the Chern-Moser normal form. These results are motivated by the classification of locally homogeneous Levi non-degenerate hypersurfaces in \CC^3 with d_0(M)=1,2 due to A. Loboda, and complement earlier joint work by V. Ezhov and the author for the case d_0(M)\ge n^2-2n+2.
