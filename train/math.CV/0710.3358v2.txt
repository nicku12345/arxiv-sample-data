Let X be an analytic complex space which is q-complete. Then it follows from a theorem of Andreotti-Grauert [1] that H^{p}(X, {\mathcal{F}})=0 for every coherent analytic sheaf {\mathcal{F}} on X if p\geq q. Until now it is not known if these two conditions are equivalent. The aim of this article is to give a counterexample to the converse of this statement. We show that there exist for each n\geq 3 open sets \Omega\subset\complexes^{n} such that H^{n-1}(\Omega, {\mathcal{F}})=0 for every {\mathcal{F}}\in coh(\Omega) but \Omega is not (n-1)-complete.
