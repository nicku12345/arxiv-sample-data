Let f be a function that is analytic in the unit disc. We give new estimates, and new proofs of existing estimates, of the Euclidean length of the image under f of a radial segment in the unit disc. Our methods are based on the hyperbolic geometry of plane domains, and we address some new questions that follow naturally from this approach.
