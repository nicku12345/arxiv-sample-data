We introduce a cohomology, called extendable cohomology, for abstract complex singular varieties based on suitable differential forms. Beside a study of the general properties of such a cohomology, we show that, given a complex vector bundle, one can compute its topological Chern classes using the extendable Chern classes, defined via a Chern-Weil type theory. We also prove that the localizations of the extendable Chern classes represent the localizations of the respective topological Chern classes, thus obtaining an abstract residue theorem for compact singular complex analytic varieties. As an application of our theory, we prove a Camacho-Sad type index theorem for holomorphic foliations of singular complex varieties.
