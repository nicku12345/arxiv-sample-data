We prove a uniqueness result for Coleff-Herrera currents which in particular means that if f=(f_1,..., f_m) defines a complete intersection, then the classical Coleff-Herrera product associated to f is the unique Coleff-Herrera current that is cohomologous to 1 with respect to the operator \delta_f-\dbar, where \delta_f is interior multiplication with f. From the uniqueness result we deduce that any Coleff-Herrera current on a variety Z is a finite sum of products of residue currents with support on Z and holomorphic forms.
