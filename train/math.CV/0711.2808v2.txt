In this paper we shall consider the growth at infinity of a sequence (P_n) of entire functions of bounded orders. Our results extend the results in \cite{trong-tuyen2} for the growth of entire functions of genus zero. Given a sequence of entire functions of bounded orders P_n(z), we found a nearly optimal condition, given in terms of zeros of P_n, for which (k_n) that we have \begin{eqnarray*} \limsup_{n\to\infty}|P_n(z)|^{1/k_n}\leq 1 \end{eqnarray*} for all z\in \mathbb C (see Theorem \ref{theo5}). Exploring the growth of a sequence of entire functions of bounded orders lead naturally to an extremal function which is similar to the Siciak's extremal function (See Section 6).
