Let X be a compact Kaehler manifold of dimension k and T be a positive closed current on X of bidimension (p,p) (1\leq p < k-1). We construct a continuous linear transform \mathcal{L}_p(T) of T which is a positive closed current on X of bidimension (k-1,k-1) which has the same Lelong numbers as T. We deduce from that construction self-intersection inequalities for positive closed currents of any bidegree.
