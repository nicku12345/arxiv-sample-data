Let H be the space of quaternions, with its standard hypercomplex structure. Let R(D) be the module of regular functions on D. For every unitary vector p in S^2, R(D) contains the space of holomorphic functions w.r.t. the complex structure J_p induced by p. We prove the existence, on any bounded domain D, of regular functions that are not J_p-holomorphic for any p. Our starting point is a result of Chen and Li concerning maps between hyperkaehler manifolds, where a similar result is obtained for a less restricted class of quaternionic maps. We give a criterion, based on the energy-minimizing property of holomorphic maps, that distinguishes J_p-holomorphic functions among regular functions.
