We prove a characterization theorem for the unit polydisc \Delta^n\subset\CC^n in the spirit of a recent result due to Kodama and Shimizu. We show that if M is a connected n-dimensional complex manifold such that (i) the group \hbox{Aut}(M) of holomorphic automorphisms of M acts on M with compact isotropy subgroups, and (ii) \hbox{Aut}(M) and \hbox{Aut}(\Delta^n) are isomorphic as topological groups equipped with the compact-open topology, then M is holomorphically equivalent to \Delta^n.
