We give an alternative representation of the closure of the Bochner transform of a holomorphic almost periodic mapping in a tube domain. For such mappings we introduce a new notion of amoeba and we show that, for mappings which are regular in the sense of Ronkin, this new notion agrees with Favorov's one. We prove that the amoeba complement of a regular holomorphic almost periodic mapping, defined on Cn and taking its values in Cm+1, is a Henriques m-convex subset of Rn. Finally, we compare some different notions of regularity.
