Let X be an analytic space of pure dimension. We introduce a formalism to generate intrinsic weighted Koppelman formulas on X that provide solutions to the \dbar-equation. We prove that if \phi is a smooth (0,q+1)-form on a Stein space X with \dbar\phi=0, then there is a smooth (0,q)-form \psi on X_{reg} with at most polynomial growth at X_{sing} such that \dbar\psi=\phi. The integral formulas also give other new existence results for the \dbar-equation and Hartogs theorems, as well as new proofs of various known results.
