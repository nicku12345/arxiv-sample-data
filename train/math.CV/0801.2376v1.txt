We show how to express a conformal map of a general two connected domain in the plane such that neither boundary component is a point to a representative domain which has the virtue of having an explicit algebraic Bergman kernel function. We shall explain why the representative domain is the best analogue of the unit disc in the two connected setting. The conformal map will be given as a simple and explicit algebraic function of an Ahlfors map of the domain associated to a specially chosen point. It will follow that the conformal map can be found by solving the same extremal problem that determines a Riemann map in the simply connected case.
