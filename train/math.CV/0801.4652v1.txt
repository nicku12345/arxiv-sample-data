We study connectedness in the pluri-fine topology on \CC^n and obtain the following results. If \Omega is a pluri-finely open and pluri-finely connected set in \CC^n and E\subset\CC^n is pluripolar, then \Omega\setminus E is pluri-finely connected. The proof hinges on precise information about the structure of open sets in the pluri-fine topology: Let \Omega be a pluri-finely open subset of \CC^{n}. If z is any point in \Omega, and L is a complex line passing through z, then obviously \Omega \cap L is a finely open neighborhood of z in L. Now let C_L denote the finely connected component of z in \Omega\cap L. Then \cup_{L\ni z} C_L is a pluri-finely connected neighborhood of z. As a consequence we find that if v is a finely plurisubharmonic function defined on a pluri-finely connected pluri-finely open set, then v= -\infty on a pluri-finely open subset implies v\equiv -\infty.
