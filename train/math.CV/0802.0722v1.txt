We prove relative asymptotic for the ratio of two sequences of multiple orthogonal polynomials with respect to Nikishin system of measures. The first Nikishin system {\mathcal{N}}(\sigma_1,...,\sigma_m) is such that for each k, \sigma_k has constant sign on its compact support \supp {\sigma_k} \subset \mathbb{R} consisting of an interval \widetilde{\Delta}_k, on which |\sigma_k^{\prime}| > 0 almost everywhere, and a discrete set without accumulation points in \mathbb{R} \setminus \widetilde{\Delta}_k. If {Co}(\supp {\sigma_k}) = \Delta_k denotes the smallest interval containing \supp {\sigma_k}, we assume that \Delta_k \cap \Delta_{k+1} = \emptyset, k=1,...,m-1. The second Nikishin system {\mathcal{N}}(r_1\sigma_1,...,r_m\sigma_m) is a perturbation of the first by means of rational functions r_k, k=1,...,m, whose zeros and poles lie in \mathbb{C} \setminus \cup_{k=1}^m \Delta_k.
