We extend a well-known theorem by Jones and Makarov [JM] on the singularity of boundary distortion of planar conformal mappings. We use a different technique to recover the previous result and, moreover, generalize the result for quasiconformal mappings of the unit ball \B^n\subset \mathbb{R}^n, n\ge 2. We also establish an estimate on the Hausdorff (gauge) dimension of the boundary of the image domain outside an exceptional set of given size on the sphere \partial \B^n. Furthermore, we show that this estimate is essentially sharp.   [JM] P. W. Jones and N. Makarov: Density properties of harmonic measure. Ann. Math. 142 (1995), 427--455.
