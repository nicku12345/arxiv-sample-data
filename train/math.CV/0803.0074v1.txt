Let M\subset \mathbb{C}^{n+1} (n\geq 2) be a real analytic submanifold defined by an equation of the form: w=|z|^2+O(|z|^3), where we use (z,w)\in \mathbb{C}^{n}\times \mathbb{C} for the coordinates of \mathbb{C}^{n+1}. We first derive a pseudo-normal form for M near 0. We then use it to prove that (M,0) is holomorphically equivalent to the quadric (M_\infty: w=|z|^2,0) if and only if it can be formally transformed to (M_\infty,0). We also use it to give a necessary and sufficient condition when (M,0) can be formally flattened. The result is due to Moser for the case of n=1.
