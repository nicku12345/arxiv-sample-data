Let Y be a weighted homogeneous (singular) subvariety of C^n. The main objective of this paper is to present an explicit formula for solving the d-bar-equation f=\dbar{g} on the regular part of Y, where f is a d-bar-closed (0,1)-form with compact support. This formula will then be used to give H\"older estimates for the solution in case Y is homogeneous (a cone) with an isolated singularity. Finally, a slight modification of our formula also gives an L^2-bounded solution operator in case Y is pure dimensional and homogeneous.
