We have introduced and investigated so-called Shlomilchs and Bells series for modified Bessel's functions, namely, their asymptotic and non-asymptotic properties, connection with Stirling's and Bell's numbers etc.   We have obtained exact constants in the moment inequalities for sums of centered independent random variables, improved their asymptotical properties, found lower and upper bounds, calculated a more exact approximation, elaborated the numerical algorithm for their calculation, studied the class of smoothing, etc.
