We give sufficient conditions for the quotient of a free, properly discontinuous action on a bounded domain of holomorphy to be a Stein manifold in terms of Poincar\'e series or limit sets for orbits. An immediate consequence is that the quotient of any cyclic, free, properly discontinuous action on the unit ball or the bidisc is Stein.
