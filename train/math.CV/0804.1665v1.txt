This paper studies the singularities of Cullen-regular functions of one quaternionic variable. The quaternionic Laurent series prove to be Cullen-regular. The singularities of Cullen-regular functions are thus classified as removable, essential or poles. The quaternionic analogues of meromorphic complex functions, called semiregular functions, turn out to be quotients of Cullen-regular functions with respect to an appropriate division operation. This allows a detailed study of the poles and their distribution.
