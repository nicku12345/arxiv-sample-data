The first part of this paper considers higher order CR invariants of three dimensional hypersurfaces of finite type. Using a full normal form we give a complete characterization of hypersurfaces with trivial local automorphism group, and analogous results for finite groups. The second part considers hypersurfaces of finite Catlin multitype and the Kohn-Nirenberg phenomenon in higher dimensions. We give a necessary condition for local convexifiability of a class of pseudoconvex hypersurfaces in \mathbb C^{n+1}.
