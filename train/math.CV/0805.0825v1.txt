We examine the algebra of all Dirichlet Series bounded on the right half plane. We consider the analogue of the Corona theorem in this setting, and show that it is false, i.e. the right half-plane is not dense in the maximal ideal space. We also prove some refinements of the Hille-Bohnenblust theorem, where both probabilistic and deterministic devices are used, and we show how the proof is carried out for each.
