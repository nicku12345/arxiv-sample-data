This paper is motivated by Grothendieck's splitting theorem. In the 1960s, Gohberg generalized this to a class of Banach bundles. We consider a compact complex manifold X and a holomorphic Banach bundle E \to X that is a compact perturbation of a trivial bundle in a sense recently introduced by Lempert. We prove that E splits into the sum of a finite rank bundle and a trivial bundle, provided H^{1}(X, \O)=0.
