We study the complex Monge-Ampre operator on the classes of finite pluricomplex energy \mathcal{E}_\chi (\Omega) in the general case (\chi(0)=0 i.e. the total Monge-Ampre mass may be infinite). We establish an interpretation of these classes in terms of the speed of decrease of the capacity of sublevel sets and give a complete description of the range of the operator (dd^c \cdot)^n on the classes \mathcal{E}\chi(\Omega).
