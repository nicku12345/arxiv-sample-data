Let A be a sequence of points of \mathbb{B}^n the unit ball in \mathbb{C}^n. In terms of interpolating vectorial function (or Amar's function)[1], we give a necessary condition on A to be interpolating for the weighted Bergman space B^p_\alpha (\mathbb{B}^n). In the particular case of Hardy space H^p (\mathbb{B}^2), this condition is sufficient no optimal. In the main theorem proof, we resolve Gleason's problem (vectorial form) in B^p_\alpha (\mathbb{B}^n)
