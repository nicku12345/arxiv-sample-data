We classify the germs of \mathcal{C}^\infty CR manifolds that admit a smooth CR contraction. We show that such a CR manifold is embedded into \CC^n as a real hypersurface defined by a polynomial defining function consisting of monomials whose degrees are completely determined by the extended resonances of the contraction. Furthermore the contraction map extends to a holomorphic contraction that coincides in fact with its polynomial normal form. Consequently, several results concerning Complex and CR geometry are derived.
