We introduce the regular product for Cullen-regular quaternionic functions in a manner that does not depend upon a representation in power series but upon another, weaker kind of representation. The special case when the functions are represented as quaternionic power series is studied. We show that the regular ring of quaternionic power series is a subring of the regular associative ring of real-analytical Hyperholomorphic functions.
