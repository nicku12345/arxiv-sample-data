In certain classes of subharmonic functions u on C distinguished in terms of lower bounds for the Riesz measure of u, a sharp estimate is obtained for the rate of approximation by functions of the form log |f(z)|, where f is an entire function. The results complement and generalize those recently obtained by Yu. Lyubarskii and Eu. Malinnikova.
