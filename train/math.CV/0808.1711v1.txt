We consider a Stein manifold M of dimension \geq 2 and a compact subset K\subset M such that M'=M\backslash K is connected. Let S be a compact differential manifold, and let M_S, resp. M'_S stand for the complex manifold of maps S\to M, resp. S\to M', of some specified regularity, that are homotopic to constant. We prove that any holomorphic function on M'_S continues analytically to M_S (perhaps as a multivalued function).
