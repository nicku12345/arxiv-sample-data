For every CR-manifold germ (M,a) local tube realizations are characterized by certain abelian subalgebras of the real Lie algebra hol(M,a) of all germs of (real-analytic) infinitesimal transformations. For instance, if M is holomorphically non-degenerate, every such subalgebra is maximal abelian and the classification of all local tube realizations for (M,a) reduces to a purely algebraic problem.
