Weighted pluripotential theory is a rapidly developing area; and Callaghan \cite{Callaghan} recently introduced \theta-incomplete polynomials in \cd for d>1. In this paper we combine these two theories by defining weighted \theta-incomplete pluripotential theory. We define weighted \theta-incomplete extremal functions and obtain a Siciak-Zahariuta type equality in terms of \theta-incomplete polynomials. Finally we prove that the extremal functions can be recovered using orthonormal polynomials and we demonstrate a result on strong asymptotics of Bergman functions in the spirit of \cite{BermanCn}.
