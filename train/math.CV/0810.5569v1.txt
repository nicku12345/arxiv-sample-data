We consider perturbations of CR structures which preserve the complex tangent bundle. For a compact generic CR manifold its concavity properties and hence the finiteness of some \overline\partial_b-cohomology groups are also preserved by such perturbations of the CR structure. Here we study the stability of the vanishing of these groups.
