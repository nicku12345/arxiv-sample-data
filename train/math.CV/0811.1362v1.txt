We prove that an ordinary Dirichlet series with coefficients a(n)=g(n b) has an abscissa of convergence 0 if g is an odd 1-periodic, real-analytic function and b is Diophantine. We also show that if g is odd and has bounded variation and b is of bounded Diophantine type r>1, then the abscissa of convergence is smaller or equal than 1-1/r. Using a polylogarithm expansion, we prove that if g is odd and real analytic and b is Diophantine, then the ordinary Dirichlet series has an analytic continuation to the entire complex plane.
