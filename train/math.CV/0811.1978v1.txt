We prove that every homomorphism \mathcal{O}^E_\zeta\to\mathcal{O}^F_\zeta, with E and F Banach spaces and \zeta\in\mathbb{C}^m, is induced by a \mathop{\mathrm{Hom}}(E,F)-valued holomorphic germ, provided that 1\leq m<\infty. A similar structure theorem is obtained for the homomorphisms of type \mathcal{O}^E_\zeta\to\mathcal{S}_\zeta, where \mathcal{S}_\zeta is a stalk of a coherent sheaf of positive \mathfrak{m}_\zeta-depth. We later extend these results to sheaf homomorphisms, obtaining a condition on coherent sheaves which guarantees the sheaf to be equipped with a unique analytic structure in the sense of Lempert-Patyi.
