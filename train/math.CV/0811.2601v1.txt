Consider the straightening phi of a Beltrami form that is constant on a square, with the corresponding ellipses having a vertical major axis, and null outside. A generalized Schwarz-Christoffel formula is used to express the inverse of phi. The formula is found by introducing an affine Riemann surface. This formula is used to draw on a computer the image of the square by phi, and practical aspects are discussed. The resulting shapes are shown for different values of the constant dilatation ratio of the ellipses (=major axis/minor axis). The limit when this ratio tends to infinity is surprising. A model of this limit is proposed, produced by an affine surface uniformization.
