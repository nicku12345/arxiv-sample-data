Let Y be a weighted homogeneous (singular) subvariety of C^n. The main objective of this paper is to present a class of explicit integral formulae for solving the d-bar-equation \omega=\dbar\lambda on the regular part of Y, where \omega is a d-bar-closed (0,q)-form with compact support and degree q>=1. Particular cases of these formulae yield L^p-bounded solution operators for 1<=p<=\infty if Y is a homogeneous and pure dimensional subvariety with an arbitrary singular locus.
