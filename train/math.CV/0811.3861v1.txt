We show that Alexander's extendibility theorem for a local automorphism of the unit ball is valid also for a local automorphism f of a pseudoellipsoid \E^n_{(p_1, ..., p_{k})} \= \{z \in \C^n : \sum_{j= 1}^{n - k}|z_j|^2 + |z_{n-k+1}|^{2 p_1} + ... + |z_n|^{2 p_{k}} < 1 \}, provided that f is defined on a region \U \subset \E^n_{(p)} such that: i) \partial \U \cap \partial \E^n_{(p)} contains an open set of strongly pseudoconvex points; ii) \U \cap \{z_i = 0 \} \neq \emptyset for any n-k +1 \leq i \leq n. By the counterexamples we exhibit, such hypotheses can be considered as optimal.
