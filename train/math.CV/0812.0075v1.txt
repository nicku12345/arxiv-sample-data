We continue the work of \cite{TLNT}. Let E be a non-Blaschke subset of the unit disc \mathbb{D} of the complex plane \mathbb{C}. Fixed 1\leq p\leq \infty, let H^p(\mathbb{D}) be the Hardy space of holomorphic functions in the disk whose boundary value function is in L^p(\partial \mathbb{D}). Fixed 0<R<1. For \epsilon >0 define C_p(\varepsilon, R) = \sup \{\sup_{|z| \leq R}|g(z)|: g\in H^p, \|g\|_p\leq 1, |g(\zeta)| \leq \varepsilon \forall \zeta\in E\}. In this paper we find upper and lower bounds for C_p(\epsilon, R) when \epsilon is small for any non-Blaschke set E. The bounds are nearly-optimal for many such sets E, including sets contained in a compact subset of \mathbb{D} and sets contained in a finite union of Stolz angles.
