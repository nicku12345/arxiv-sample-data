The purpose of this note is to show that the set functions defined in \cite{trong-tuyen} can be suitably extended to all subsets E of the unit disk \mathbb{D}. In particular we obtain uniform nearly-optimal estimates for the following quantity D_p(E,\epsilon, R) = \sup \{\sup_{|z| \leq R}|g(z)|: g\in H^p, ||g||_{H^p}\leq 1, (1-|\zeta |)|g(\zeta)| \leq \epsilon \forall \zeta\in E\}.
