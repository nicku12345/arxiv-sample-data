We study the logarithmic and ratio asymptotic of linear forms constructed from a Nikishin system which satisfy orthogonality conditions with respect to a system of measures generated from another Nikishin system. This construction combines type I and type II multiple orthogonal polynomials. The logarithmic asymptotic of the linear forms is expressed in terms of the extremal solution of an associated vector valued equilibrium problem for the logarithmic potential. The ratio asymptotic is described by means of a conformal representation of an appropriate Riemann surface of genus zero onto the extended complex plane.
