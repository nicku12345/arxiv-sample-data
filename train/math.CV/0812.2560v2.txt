For the \bar\partial-Neumann problem on a regular coordinate domain \Omega\subset \C^{n+1}, we prove \epsilon-subelliptic estimates for an index \epsilon which is in some cases better than \epsilon=\frac1{2m} (m being the {\it multiplicity}) as it was previously proved by Catlin and Cho in \cite{CC08}. This also supplies a much simplified proof of the existing literature. Our approach is founded on the method by Catlin in \cite{C87} which consists in constructing a family of weights \{\phi^\delta\} whose Levi form is bigger than \delta^{-2\epsilon} on the \delta-strip around \partial\Omega.
