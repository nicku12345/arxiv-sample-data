In [2], Coltoiu gave an example of a domain D\subset\complexes^{6} which is 4-complete such that for every {\mathcal{F}}\in Coh(\complexes^{6}) the restriction map H^{3}(\complexes^{6},{\mathcal{F}})\to H^{3}(D,{\mathcal{F}}) has a dense image but D is not 4-Runge in \complexes^{6}. Here, we prove that for every integers n\geq 4 and 1\leq q\leq n there exists a domain D\subset \complexes^{n} which is not (\tilde{q}-1)-Runge in \complexes^{n} but such that for any coherent analytic sheaf {\mathcal{F}} on \complexes^{n} the restriction map H^{p}(\complexes^{n},{\mathcal{F}})\to H^{3}(D,{\mathcal{F}}) has a dense image for all p\geq \tilde{q}-2 if q does not divide n, where \tilde{q}=n-[\frac{n}{q}]+1 and [\frac{n}{q}] denotes the integral part of \frac{n}{q}.
