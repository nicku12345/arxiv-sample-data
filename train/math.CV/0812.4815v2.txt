A theorem of Harald Bohr (1914) states that if f is a holomorphic map from the unit disc into itself, then the sum of absolute values of its Taylor expansion is less than 1 for |z|<1/3. The bound 1/3 is optimal. This result has been extended in a suitable sense by Liu Taishun and Wang Jianfei (2007) to the bounded complex symmetric domains of the four classical series, and to polydiscs. The result of Liu and Wang may be generalized to all bounded symmetric domains, with a proof which does not depend on classification.
