The real projective plan P^2 can be endowed with a dianalytic structure making it into a non orientable Klein surface. Dianalytic self-mappings of that surface are projections of analytic self-mappings of the Riemann sphere \widehat{\mathbb{C}}. It is known that the only analytic bijective self-mappings of \widehat{\mathbb{C}} are the Moebius transformations. The Blaschke products are obtained by multiplying particular Moebius transformations. They are no longer one-to-one mappings. However, some of these products can be projected on P^2 and they become dianalytic self-mappings of P^2. More exactly, they represent canonical projections of non orientable branched covering Klein surfaces over P^2. This article is devoted to color visualization of such mappings. The working tool is the technique of simultaneous continuation we introduced in previous papers.
