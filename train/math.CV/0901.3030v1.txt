We establish extension theorems for separately holomorphic mappings defined on sets of the form W\setminus M with values in a complex analytic space which possesses the Hartogs extension property. Here W is a 2-fold cross of arbitrary complex manifolds and M is a set of singularities which is locally pluripolar (resp. thin) in fibers.
