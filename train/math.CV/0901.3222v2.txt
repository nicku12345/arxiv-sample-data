In the previous version of this paper we prove a theorem on the boundary behavior of the conical plurisubharmonic measure. However, the proof turns out to be incomplete. In the present version we give a corrected proof of this theorem. We next apply it to the theory of separately holomorphic functions. These applications are presented in a more accessible way than in the previous version.
