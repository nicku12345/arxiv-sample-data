We consider complex manifolds that admit actions by holomorphic transformations of classical simple real Lie groups and classify all such manifolds in a natural situation. Under our assumptions, which require the group at hand to be dimension-theoretically large with respect to the manifold on which it is acting, our classification result states that the manifolds which arise are described precisely as invariant open subsets of certain complex flag manifolds associated to the complexified groups.
