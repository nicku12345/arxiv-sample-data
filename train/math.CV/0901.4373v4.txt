Assume that E and B are complex manifolds and that pi is a holomorphic Serre fibration from E onto E such that E admits a finite dominating family of holomorphic fiber-sprays over a small neighborhood of any point in B. We show that the parametric Oka property (POP) of B implies POP of E; conversely, POP of E implies POP of B for contractible parameter spaces. This follows from a parametric Oka principle for holomorphic liftings which we establish in the paper.
