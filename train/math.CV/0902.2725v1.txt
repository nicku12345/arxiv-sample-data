This paper is a continuation of the paper [5] dealing with dynamics of dianalytic transformations of nonorientable Klein surfaces. We are examining mainly the transformations of the real projective plane P^{2},  whose orientable double cover is the Riemann sphere \overline{C} . It is shown that the automorphisms of P^{2} are projections of the rotations of \ \overline{C} and some of the other dianalytic transformations of P^{2} are projections of Blaschke products.
