Let \I be a coherent subsheaf of a locally free sheaf \Ok(E_0) and suppose that \F=\Ok(E_0)/\I has pure codimension. Starting with a residue current R obtained from a locally free resolution of \F we construct a vector-valued Coleff-Herrera current \mu with support on the variety associated to \F such that \phi is in \I if and only if \mu\phi=0. Such a current \mu can also be derived algebraically from a fundamental theorem of Roos about the bidualizing functor, and the relation between these two approaches is discussed. By a construction due to Bj\"ork one gets Noetherian operators for \I from the current \mu. The current R also provides an explicit realization of the Dickenstein-Sessa decomposition and other related canonical isomorphisms.
