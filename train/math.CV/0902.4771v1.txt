In this paper we show how to construct a regular, non commutative Cauchy kernel for slice regular quaternionic functions. We prove an (algebraic) representation formula for such functions, which leads to a new Cauchy formula. We find the expression of the derivatives of a regular function in terms of the powers of the Cauchy kernel, and we present several other consequent results.
