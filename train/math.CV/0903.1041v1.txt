Let P(z) be a polynomial of degree n\geq 1. In this paper we define an operator B, as following, B[P(z)]:=\lambda_0 P(z)+\lambda_1 (\frac{nz}{2}) \frac{P'(z)}{1!}+\lambda_2 (\frac{nz}{2})^2 \frac{P''(z)}{2!}, where \lambda_0,\lambda_1 and \lambda_2 are such that all the zeros of u(z)=\lambda_0 +c(n,1)\lambda_1 z+c(n,2) \lambda_2 z^2 lie in half plane |z|\leq |z-\frac{n}{2}| and obtain a new generalization of some well-known results.
