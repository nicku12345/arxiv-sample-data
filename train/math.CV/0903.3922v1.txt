We obtain some L2 results for d-bar on forms that vanish to high order on the singular set of a complex space. As a consequence of our main theorem we obtain weighted L2-solvability results for compactly supported d-bar closed (p,q) forms defined on certain relatively compact subdomains of the complex space. The latter result can be used to give an alternate proof of a theorem of Merker and Porten.
