We apply integral representations for (0,q)-forms, q\ge1, on non-smooth strictly pseudoconvex domains, the Henkin-Leiterer domains, to derive weighted C^k estimates for a given (0,q)-form, f, in terms of C^k norms of \mdbar f, and \mdbar^{\ast} f. The weights are powers of the gradient of the defining function of the domain.
