CR singularities of real 4-submanifolds in complex 3-space are classified by using local holomorphic coordinate changes to transform the quadratic coefficients of the real analytic defining equation into a normal form. The quadratic coefficients determine an intersection index, which appears in global enumerative formulas for CR singularities of compact submanifolds.
