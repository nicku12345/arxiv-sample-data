In this paper we give the first examples of positive closed currents in \mathbb{C}^2 with continuous potentials, vanishing self-intersection, and which are not laminar. More precisely, they are supported on sets "without analytic structure". The result is mostly interesting when the potential has regularity close to C^2, because laminarity is expected to hold in that case. We actually construct examples which are C^{1,\alpha} for all \alpha<1.
