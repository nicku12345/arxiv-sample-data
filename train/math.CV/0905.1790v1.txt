This paper is devoted to investigate the singular directions of mero- morphic functions in some angular domains. We will confirm the existence of Hayman T directions in some angular domains. This is a continuous work of Yang [Yang L., Borel directions of meromorphic functions in an angular domain, Science in China, Math. Series(I)(1979), 149-163.] and Zheng [Zheng, J.H., Value Distribution of Meromorphic Functions, preprint.].
