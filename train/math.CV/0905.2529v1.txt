We consider an alternative approach to a fundamental CR invariant - the Catlin multitype. It is applied to a general smooth hypersurface in \mathbbC^{n+1}, not necessarily pseudoconvex. Using this approach, we prove biholomorphic equivalence of models, and give an explicit description of biholomorphisms between different models. A constructive finite algorithm for computing the multitype is described. The results can be viewed a necessary step in understanding local biholomorphic equivalence of Levi degenerate hypersurfaces of finite Catlin multitype.
