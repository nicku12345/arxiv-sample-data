We describe the growth of the naturally defined argument of a bounded analytic function in the unit disk in terms of the complete measure introduced by A.Grishin. As a consequence, we characterize the local behavior of a logarithm of an analytic function. We also find necessary and sufficient conditions for closeness of \log f(z), f\in H^\infty, and the local concentration of the zeros of f.
