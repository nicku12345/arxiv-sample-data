In this paper, we study holomorphic mappings sending a hyperquadric of signature \ell in \bC^n into a hyperquadric of signature \ell' in \bC^N. We show (Theorem \ref{main}) that if the signature difference \ell'-\ell is not too large, then the mapping can be normalized by automorphisms of the target hyperquadric to a particularly simple form and, in particular, the image of the mapping is contained in a complex plane of a dimension that depends only on \ell and \ell', and not on the target dimension N. We also prove a Hopf Lemma type result (Theorem \ref{main2}) for such mappings.
