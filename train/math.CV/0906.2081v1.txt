We prove that every bounded finely plurisubharmonic function can be locally (in the pluri-fine topology) written as the difference of two usual plurisubharmonic functions. As a consequence finely plurisubharmonic functions are continuous with respect to the pluri-fine topology. Moreover we show that -infinity sets of finely plurisubharmonic functions are pluripolar, hence graphs of finely holomorphic functions are pluripolar.
