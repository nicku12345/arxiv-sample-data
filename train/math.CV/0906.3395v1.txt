In this paper we investigate proper \mbb{R}--actions on hyperbolic Stein surfaces and prove in particular the following result: Let D\subset\mbb{C}^2 be a simply-connected bounded domain of holomorphy which admits a proper \mbb{R}--action by holomorphic transformations. The quotient D/\mbb{Z} with respect to the induced proper \mbb{Z}--action is a Stein manifold. A normal form for the domain D is deduced.
