In this paper we study the relation between the weighted energy class \mathcal{E}_{\chi} introduced by S. Benelkouchi, V. Guedj and A. Zeriahi recently with the classes \mathcal{E} and \mathcal{N} studied by Cegrell. Moreover, we establish a generalized comparison principle for the operator \text{M}_{\chi} and, as an application, we prove a slight version of existence of solutions of Monge-Amp\`ere type equation in the class \mathcal{E}_{\chi}(H,\O).
