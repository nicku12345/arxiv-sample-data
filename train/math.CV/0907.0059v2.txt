We consider Levi non-degenerate tube hypersurfaces in \CC^{n+1} that are (k,n-k)-spherical, i.e. locally CR-equivalent to the hyperquadric with Levi form of signature (k,n-k), with n\le 2k. We show that the number of affine equivalence classes of such hypersurfaces is infinite (in fact, uncountable) in the following cases: (i) k=n-2, n\ge 7;\linebreak (ii) k=n-3, n\ge 7; (iii) k\le n-4. For all other values of k and n, except for k=3, n=6, the number of affine classes is known to be finite. The exceptional case k=3, n=6 has been recently resolved by Fels and Kaup who gave an example of a family of (3,3)-spherical tube hypersurfaces that contains uncountably many pairwise affinely non-equivalent elements. In this paper we deal with the Fels-Kaup example by different methods. We give a direct proof of the sphericity of the hypersurfaces in the Fels-Kaup family, and use the j-invariant to show that this family indeed contains an uncountable subfamily of pairwise affinely non-equivalent hypersurfaces.
