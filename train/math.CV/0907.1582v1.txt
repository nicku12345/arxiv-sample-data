We extend and simplify results of \cite{Din~2009} where the asymptotic behavior of the holomorphic sectional curvature of the Bergman metric in annuli is studied. Similarly as in \cite{Din~2009} the description enables us to construct an infinitely connected planar domain (in our paper it is a Zalcman type domain) for which the supremum of the holomorphic sectional curvature is two whereas its infimum is equal to -\infty.
