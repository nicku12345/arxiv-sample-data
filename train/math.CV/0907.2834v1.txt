In this paper we have introduced two new classes \mathcal{H}\mathcal{M}(\beta, \lambda, k, \nu) and \overline{\mathcal{H}\mathcal{M}} (\beta, \lambda, k, \nu) of complex valued harmonic multivalent functions of the form f = h + \overline g, satisfying the condition \[ Re \{(1 - \lambda) \frac{\Omega^vf}{z} + \lambda(1-k) \frac{(\Omega^vf)'}{z'} + \lambda k \frac{(\Omega^vf)''}{z''} \} > \beta, (z\in \mathcal{D})\] where h and g are analytic in the unit disk \mathcal{D} = \{z : |z| < 1\}. A sufficient coefficient condition for this function in the class \mathcal{H}\mathcal{M}(\beta, \lambda, k, \nu) and a necessary and sufficient coefficient condition for the function f in the class \overline{\mathcal{H}\mathcal{M}}(\beta, \lambda, k, \nu) are determined. We investigate inclusion relations, distortion theorem, extreme points, convex combination and other interesting properties for these families of harmonic functions.
