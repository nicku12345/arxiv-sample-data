Motivated by the Shilov boundaries of bounded symmetric domains we consider arbitrary CR-quadrics in a complex linear space (of finite dimension) that have a certain symmetry property. For these the non-affine local CR-automorphisms have a simple explicit description. A large class of examples is presented.
