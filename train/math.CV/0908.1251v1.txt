A classical result states that every lower bounded superharmonic function on \Bbb R^2 is constant. In this paper the following (stronger) one-circle version is proven. If f\colon \Bbb R^2\to (-\infty,\infty] is lower semicontinuous, \liminf_{|x|\to\infty} f(x)/\ln|x|\ge 0, and, for every x\in\Bbb R^2, 1/(2\pi) \int_0^{2\pi} f(x+r(x)e^{it}) dt\le f(x), where r\colon \Bbb R^2\to (0,\infty) is continuous, \sup_{x\in\Bbb R^2} (r(x)-|x|)<\infty, and \inf_{x\in\Bbb R^2} (r(x)-|x|)=-\infty, then f is constant.   Moreover, it is shown that, with respect to the assumption r\le c|\cdot|+M on \Bbb R^d, there is a striking difference between the restricted volume mean property for the cases d=1 and d=2.
