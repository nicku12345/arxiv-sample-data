We prove that the Shilov boundary is invariant under proper holomorphic mappings between some classes of domains (containing among others quasi-balanced domains with the continuous Minkowski functionals). Moreover, we obtain an extension theorem for proper holomorphic mappings between quasi-circular domains.   Using these results we show that there are no non-trivial proper holomorphic self-mappings in the tetrablock. Another important result of our work is a description of Shilov boundaries of a large class of domains (containing among other the symmetrized polydisc and the tetrablock).   It is also shown that the tetrablock is not \mathbb C-convex.
