We give a precise characterization when a compact homogeneous CR-solvmanifold is CR-embeddable in a Kahler manifold. Equivalently this gives a non-Kahler criterion for complex manifolds containing CR-solvmanifolds not satisfying these conditions. This paper is the natural continuation of [OR] and [GOR].
