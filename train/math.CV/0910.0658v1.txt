The model 4-dimensional CR-cubic in \CC{3} has the following "model" property: it is (essentially) the unique locally homogeneous 4-dimensional CR-manifold in \CC{3} with finite-dimensional infinitesimal automorphism algebra \mathfrak{g} and non-trivial isotropy subalgebra. We study and classify, up to local biholomorphic equivalence, all \mathfrak{g}-homogeneous hypersurfaces in \CC{3} and also classify the corresponding local transitive actions of the model algebra \mathfrak{g} on hypersurfaces in \CC{3}.
