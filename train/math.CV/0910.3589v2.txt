We construct Coleff-Herrera products and Bochner-Martinelli type residue currents associated with a tuple f of weakly holomorphic functions, and show that these currents satisfy basic properties from the (strongly) holomorphic case, as the transformation law, the Poincar\'e-Lelong formula and the equivalence of the Coleff-Herrera product and the Bochner-Martinelli type residue current associated with f when f defines a complete intersection.
