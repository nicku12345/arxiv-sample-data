Let B^n be the n-dimensional unit complex ball and let a and b be two distinct points in its closure. Let f be a real-analytic function on the complex unit sphere \partial B^n. Suppose that for any complex line L, meeting the two points set \{a,b\}, the function f admits one-dimensional holomorphic extension in the cross-section L \cap B^n. Then f is the boundary value of a function holomorphic in B^n. Two points can not be replaced by a single point. The proof essentially uses recent result of the author about characterization of polyanalytic functions in the complex plane.
