The main result shows a small perturbation of a univalent function is again a univalent function, hence a univalent function has a neighborhood consisting entirely of univalent functions.   For the particular choice of a linear function in the hypothesis of the main theorem, we obtain a corollary which is equivalent to the classical Noshiro-Warschawski-Wolff univalence criterion.   We also present an application of the main result in terms of Taylor series, and we show that the hypothesis of our main result is sharp.
