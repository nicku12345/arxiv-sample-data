In this paper we give some applications of a lemma of Babalola and Opoola \cite{BO}, which is a classical extension of an earlier one by Lewandowski, Miller and Zlotkiewicz \cite{LMZ}. The applications were given via a new generalization of some well-known subclasses of univalent functions, and they unify many known results.
