Let E be the open unit disk \{z\in \mathbb{C}: |z|<1\}. Let A be the class of analytic functions in E, which have the form f(z)=z+a_2z^2+.... We define operators L_n^\sigma\colon A\to A using the convolution *. Using these operators, we define and study new classes of functions in the unit disk. Moreover, we obtain some basic properties of the new classes, namely inclusion, growth, covering, distortion, closure under certain integral transformation and coefficient inequalities.
