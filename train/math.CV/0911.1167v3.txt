Locally homogeneous CR-manifolds in dimension 3 were classified, up to local CR-equivalence, by E.Cartan. We classify, up to local CR-equivalence, all locally homogeneous CR-manifolds in dimension 4. The classification theorem enables us also to classify all symmetric CR-manifolds in dimension 4, up to local biholomorphic equivalence. We also prove that any 4-dimensional real Lie algebra can be realized as an algebra of affine vector fields in a domain in \CC{3}, linearly independent at each point.
