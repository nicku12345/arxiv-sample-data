In this note we investigate the inclusion relationship between the class of strongly starlike functions of order alpha and type beta and the class of strongly convex functions of order alpha and type beta which are subclass of normalized analytic functions defined on the unit disk. Some applications of our main result are also presented which contains various classical results for the typical subclasses of starlike and convex functions.
