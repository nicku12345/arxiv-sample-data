Given a holomorphic submersion of reduced complex spaces, we prove that the basic Oka property of the submersion implies the parametric Oka property. This generalizes the corresponding result for complex manifolds (F. Forstneric, Oka Manifolds, C. R. Acad. Sci. Paris, Ser. I, 347 (2009) 1017-1020). It follows that a stratified elliptic (or subelliptic) holomorphic submersion, or a stratified holomorphic fiber bundle whose fibers are Oka manifolds, enjoys the parametric Oka property. As an application we give a parametric version of the factorization theorem due to Ivarsson and Kutzschebauch (A solution of Gromov's Vaserstein problem, C. R. Acad. Sci. Paris, Ser. I 346 (2008) 1239-1243) for holomorphic maps from finite dimensional reduced Stein spaces to the special linear group SL_n(C).
