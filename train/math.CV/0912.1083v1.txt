Let a function u(x,y) be harmonic in the domain  D\times V_r=D\times \{y\in \mathbb{R}^m: |y|<r\}\subset \mathbb{R}^n\times \mathbb{R}^m  and for each fixed point x^0 from some a set E\subset D, %which is not embedded in countable association of N-sets of  Lh_0(D), the function u(x^0,y), as a function of variable y, can be extended to a harmonic function on the whole \mathbb{R}^m. Then u(x,y) harmonically extends to the domain D\times \mathbb{R}^m as a function of variables x and y.
