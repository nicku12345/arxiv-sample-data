In this paper, we firstly give the definition of meromorphic function element and algebroid mapping. We also construct the algebroid function family in which the arithmetic, differential operations is closed. On basis of these works, we firstly proved the Second Main Theorem concerning small algebroid functions for v-valued algebroid functions.
