Let G(k)=\int_0^1g(x)e^{kx}dx, g\in L^1(0,1). The main result of this paper is the following theorem.   {\bf Theorem}. {\it If \limsup_{k\to +\infty}|G(k)|<\infty, then g=0. There exists g\not\equiv 0, g\in L^1(0,1), such that G(k_j)=0, k_j<k_{j+1}, \lim_{j\to \infty}k_j=\infty, \lim_{k\to \infty}|G(k)| does not exist, \limsup_{k\to +\infty}|G(k)|=\infty. This g oscillates infinitely often in any interval [1-\delta, 1], however small \delta>0 is.}
