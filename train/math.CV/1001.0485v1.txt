Let the unions of real intervals I = \cup_{j = 1}^l [a_{2 j -1},a_{2j}], a_1 < ... < a_{2 l}, and I_n = \cup_{k = 1}^m [B_{k,n}, C_{k,n}] be such that \cap_{k = 1}^{\infty} [B_{k,n},C_{k,n}] = \{c_k \} for k = 1,...,m and {\rm dist}(E,I_n) \geq const > 0. We show how to express asymptotically the Green's function \phi(z,\infty,E \cup I_n) of E \cup I_n at z = \infty in terms of the Green's function \phi(z,\infty,E) and \phi(z,c_k,E). The formula yields immediately asymptotics for \phi^n(z,\infty,E \cup I_n) with respect to n which are important in many problems of approximation theory. Another consequence is an asymptotic representation of cap(E \cup I_n) in terms of cap(E) and \phi(z,c_k,E) and of the harmonic measure \omega(\infty, E_j,E \cup I_n).
