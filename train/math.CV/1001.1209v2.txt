We consider actions of reductive complex Lie groups G=K^C on K\"ahler manifolds X such that the K--action is Hamiltonian and prove then that the closures of the G--orbits are complex-analytic in X. This is used to characterize reductive homogeneous K\"ahler manifolds in terms of their isotropy subgroups. Moreover we show that such manifolds admit K--moment maps if and only if their isotropy groups are algebraic.
