We study period maps for families of K3 surfaces those are given by anti canonical divisors of toric varieties coming from reflexive polytopes P_2, P_4, P_5 and P_r. We obtain systems of period differential equations for these families. Moreover, in the case P_4, we determine the projective monodromy group of the period map. This group is explicitly related with the Hilbert modular group for \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{5}).
