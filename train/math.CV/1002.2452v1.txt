Solutions to the Dirac equation are obtained by considering functions of axial type. This indeed gives rise to Vekua systems that can be solved in terms of special functions. In this paper we investigate axial symmetry for the solutions of the two-sided monogenic system and we give examples involving Bessel functions.
