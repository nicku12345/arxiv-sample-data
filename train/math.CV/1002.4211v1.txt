First we recall the definition of locally residual currents and their basic properties. We prove in this first section a trace theorem, that we use later. Then we define the Abel-Radon transform of a current {\cal R}(\alpha), on a projective variety X\subset \P^N, for a family of p-cycles of incidence variety I\subset T\times X, for which p_1:I\to T is proper and p_2:I\to X is submersive, and a domain U\subset T. Then we show the following theorem, for a family of sections of X with r-planes (which was proved for the family of lines of X=\P^N by the author for p=1, for {\cal R}(\alpha)=0 and p-planes for any q>0, and by Henkin and Passare for p-planes in \P^N and integration currents \alpha=\omega\wedge[Y], with a meromorphic q-form \omega, and projective convexity on \tilde U):   Let \alpha be a locally residual current of bidegree (q+p,p) on U^*, with U^*:=\cup_{t\in U}{H_t}\subset X, where {t}\times H_t:=p_1^{-1}(t). Then {\cal R}(\alpha) is a meromorphic q-form on U, holomorphic iff \alpha is \bar{\partial}-closed.   Let us assume that \alpha is \bar\partial-closed, and q>0. If {\cal R}(\alpha) extends meromorphically (resp. holomorphically) to a greater domain \tilde U, then \alpha extends in a unique way as a locally residual current (resp. \bar\partial-closed) to the greater domain {\tilde U}^*\subset X.
