Let \lambda be a real number with -\pi/2<\lambda<\pi/2. In order to study \lambda-spirallike functions, it is natural to measure the angle according to \lambda-spirals. Thus we are led to the notion of \lambda-argument. This fits well the classical correspondence between \lambda-spirallike functions and starlike functions. Using this idea, we extend deep results of Pommerenke and Sheil-Small on starlike functions to spirallike functions. As an application, we solved a problem given by Hansen in 1971.
