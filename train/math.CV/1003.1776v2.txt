This survey mainly deals with the tilted Carath{\'e}odory class by angle \lambda (denoted by \mathcal{P}_{\lambda}) an element of which maps the unit disc into the tilted right half-plane \{w: \Re e^{i\lambda} w>0\}. Firstly we will characterize \mathcal{P}_{\lambda} from different aspects. In section 3, various estimates of functionals over \mathcal{P}_{\lambda} are deduced from the known corresponding estimates of \mathcal{P}_{0} or elementary functional analysis. Finally some subsets of analytic functions related to \mathcal{P}_{\lambda} including close-to-convex functions with argument \lambda, \lambda-spirallike functions, \lambda-Robertson functions and analytic functions whose derivative is in \mathcal{P}_{\lambda} are also considered as applications
