We define Szego coordinates on a finitely connected smoothly bounded planar domain which effect a holomorphic change of coordinates on the domain that can be as close to the identity as desired and which convert the domain to a quadrature domain with respect to boundary arc length. When these Szego coordinates coincide with Bergman coordinates, the result is a double quadrature domain with respect to both area and arc length. We enumerate a host of interesting and useful properties that such double quadrature domains possess, and we show that such domains are in fact dense in the realm of bounded finitely connected domains with smooth boundaries.
