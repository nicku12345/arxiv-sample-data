Differential equations with constant and variable coefficients over octonions are investigated. It is found that different types of differential equations over octonions can be resolved. For this purpose non-commutative line integration is used. Such technique is applied to linear and non-linear partial differential equations in real variables. Possible areas of applications of these results are outlined.
