Let \rho_\Sigma=h(|z|^2) be a metric in a Riemann surface \Sigma, where h is a positive real function. Let \mathcal H_{r_1}=\{w=f(z)\} be the family of univalent \rho_\Sigma harmonic mapping of the Euclidean annulus A(r_1,1):=\{z:r_1< |z| <1\} onto a proper annulus A_\Sigma of the Riemann surface \Sigma, which is subject of some geometric restrictions. It is shown that if A_{\Sigma} is fixed, then \sup\{r_1: \mathcal H_{r_1}\neq \emptyset \}<1. This generalizes the similar results from Euclidean case. The cases of Riemann and of hyperbolic harmonic mappings are treated in detail. Using the fact that the Gauss map of a surface with constant mean curvature (CMC) is a Riemann harmonic mapping, an application to the CMC surfaces is given (see Corollary \ref{cor}). In addition some new examples of hyperbolic and Riemann radial harmonic diffeomorphisms are given, which have inspired some new J. C. C. Nitsche type conjectures for the class of these mappings.
