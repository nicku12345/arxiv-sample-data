We prove that if \phi is an analytic function bounded by 1 on the bidisk and \tau is a point in a face of the bidisk at which \phi satisfies Caratheodory's condition then both \phi and the angular gradient \nabla\phi exist and are constant on the face. Moreover, the class of all \phi with prescribed \phi(\tau) and \nabla\phi(\tau) can be parametrized in terms of a function in the two-variable Pick class. As an application we solve an interpolation problem with nodes that lie on faces of the bidisk.
