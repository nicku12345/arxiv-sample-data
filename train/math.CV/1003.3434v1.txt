In this survey of the Andersen-Lempert theory we present the state of the art in the study of the density property (which means that the Lie algebra generated by completely integrable holomorphic vector fields on a given Stein manifold is dense in the space of all holomorphic vector fields). There are also two new results in the paper one of which is the theorem stating that the product of Stein manifolds with the volume density property possesses such a property as well. The second one is a meaningful example of an algebraic surface without the algebraic density property. The proof of the last fact requires Brunella's technique.
