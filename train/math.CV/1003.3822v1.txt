Let u\in W^{2,p}_0, 1\le p\le \infty be a solution of the Poisson equation \Delta u = h, h\in L^p, in the unit disk. It is proved that \|\nabla u\|_{L^p} \le a_p\|h\|_{L^p} with sharp constant a_p for p=1 and p=\infty and that \|\partial u\|_{L^p} \le b_p\|h\|_{L^p} with sharp constant b_p for p=1, p=2 and p=\infty. In addition is proved that for p>2 ||\partial u||_{L^\infty}\le c_p\Vert h\Vert_{L^p} , and ||\nabla u||_{L^\infty}\le C_p\Vert h\Vert_{L^p},  with sharp constants c_p and C_p. An extension to smooth Jordan domains is given. These problems are equivalent to determining the precise value of L^p norm of {\it Cauchy transform of Dirichlet's problem}.
