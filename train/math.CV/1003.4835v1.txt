We consider the following question: Let S_1 and S_2 be two smooth, totally-real surfaces in \mathbb{C}^2 that contain the origin. If the union of their tangent planes is locally polynomially convex at the origin, then is S_1 \cup S_2 locally polynomially convex at the origin? If T_0S_1 \cap T_0S_2=\{0\}, then it is a folk result that the answer is yes. We discuss an obstruction to the presumed proof, and provide a different approach. When dimension of T_0S_1 \cap T_0S_2 over the field of real numbers is 1, we present a geometric condition under which no consistent answer to the above question exists. We then discuss conditions under which we can expect local polynomial convexity.
