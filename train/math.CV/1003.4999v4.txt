Let F(z)=\mathcal{R}e(P(z)) + h.o.t be such that M=(F=0) defines a germ of real analytic Levi-flat at 0\in\mathbb{C}^{n}, n\geq{2}, where P(z) is a homogeneous polynomial of degree k with an isolated singularity at 0\in\mathbb{C}^{n} and Milnor number \mu. We prove that there exists a holomorphic change of coordinate \phi such that \phi(M)=(\mathcal{R}e(h)=0) where h(z) is a polynomial of degree \mu+1 and j^{k}_{0}(h)=P.
