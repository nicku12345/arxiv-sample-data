Homogeneous complex manifolds satisfying various types of Levi conditions are considered. Classical results which were of particular interest to Andreotti are recalled. Convexity and concavity properties of flag domains are discussed in some detail. A precise classification of pseudoconvex flag domains is given. It is shown that flag domains which are in a certain sense generic are pseudoconcave.
