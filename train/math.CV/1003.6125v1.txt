Let B^n be the unit ball in \mathbb C^n and let the points a_1,...,a_{n+1} \in B^n  are affinely independent. If f \in C(\partial B^n) and for any complex line L, containing at least one of the points a_j, the restriction f|_{L \cap \partial B^n} extends holomorphically in the disc L \cap B^n, then f is the boundary value of a holomorphic function in B^n. The condition for the points a_j is sharp. The result confirms a conjecture from the preprint arXiv:0910.3592 by the author.
