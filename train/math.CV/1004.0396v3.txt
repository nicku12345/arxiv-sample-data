Let X be a singular Hermitian complex space of pure dimension n. We use a resolution of singularities to give a smooth representation of the L^2-\overline\partial-cohomology of (n,q)-forms on X. The central tool is an L^2-resolution for the Grauert-Riemenschneider canonical sheaf \mathcal{K}_X. As an application, we obtain a Grauert-Riemenschneider-type vanishing theorem for forms with values in almost positive line bundles. If X is a Gorenstein space with canonical singularities, then we get also an L^2-representation of the flabby cohomology of the structure sheaf \mathcal{O}_X. To understand also the L^2-\overline\partial-cohomology of (0,q)-forms on X, we introduce a new kind of canonical sheaf, namely the canonical sheaf of square-integrable holomorphic n-forms with some (Dirichlet) boundary condition at the singular set of X. If X has only isolated singularities, then we use an L^2-resolution for that sheaf and a resolution of singularities to give a smooth representation of the L^2-\overline\partial-cohomology of (0,q)-forms.
