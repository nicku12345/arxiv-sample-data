The Bohr theorem states that any function f(z) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} a_{n} z^{n}, analytic and bounded in the open unit disk, obeys the inequality \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} |a_{n}| |z|^{n} < 1 in the open disk of radius 1/3, the so-called Bohr radius. Moreover, the value 1/ cannot be improved. In this paper we review some results related to this theorem for the three-dimensional Euclidean space in the setting of quaternionic analysis. The existing results for the Bohr radius will be improved and also some estimates for the hypercomplex derivative of a monogenic function by the norm of the function will be proved.
