We study the signature pair for certain group-invariant Hermitian polynomials arising in CR geometry. In particular, we determine the signature pair for the finite subgroups of SU(2). We introduce the asymptotic positivity ratio and compute it for cyclic subgroups of U(2). We calculate the signature pair for dihedral subgroups of U(2).
