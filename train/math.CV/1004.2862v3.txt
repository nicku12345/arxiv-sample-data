We present a classification of 2-dimensional, taut, Stein manifolds with a proper \R-action. For such manifolds the globalization with respect to the induced local \C-action turns out to be Stein. As an application we determine all 2-dimensional taut, non-complete, Hartogs domains over a Riemann surface.
