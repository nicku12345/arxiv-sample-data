It is established a series of criteria for continuous and homeomorphic extension to the boundary of the so-called lower Q-homeomorphisms f between domains in \overline{\Rn}=\Rn\cup\{\infty\}, n\geqslant2, under integral constraints of the type \int\Phi(Q^{n-1}(x))\,dm(x)<\infty with a convex non-decreasing function \Phi:[0,\infty]\to[0,\infty]. It is shown that integral conditions on the function \Phi found by us are not only sufficient but also necessary for a continuous extension of f to the boundary. It is given also applications of the obtained results to the mappings with finite area distortion and, in particular, to finitely bi-Lipschitz mappings that are a far reaching generalization of isometries as well as quasi-isometries in \Rn. In particular, it is obtained a generalization and strengthening of the well-known theorem by Gehring--Martio on a homeomorphic extension to boundaries of quasiconformal mappings between QED (quasiextremal distance) domains.
