We study the convergence of a formal power series of two variables if its restrictions on curves belonging to a certain family are convergent. Also analyticity of a given C^\infty  function f is proved when the restriction of f on analytic curves belonging to some family is analytic. Our results generalize two known statements: a theorem of P. Lelong and the Bochnak-Siciak Theorem. The questions we study fall into the category of "Osgood-Hartogs-type" problems.
