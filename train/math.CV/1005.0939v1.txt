We prove a local regularity (and a corresponding a priori estmate) for plurisubharmonic solutions of the nondegenerate complex Monge-Amp\'ere equation assuming that their W^{2,p}-norm is under control for some p>n(n-1). This condition is optimal. We use in particular some methods developed by Trudinger and an L^q-estimate for the complex Monge-Amp\'ere equation due to Ko{\l}odziej.
