We describe various approaches to Coleff-Herrera products of residue currents R^j (of Cauchy-Fantappi\`e-Leray type) associated to holomorphic mappings f_j. More precisely, we study to which extent (exterior) products of natural regularizations of the individual currents R^j yield regularizations of the corresponding Coleff-Herrera products. Our results hold globally on an arbitrary pure-dimensional complex space.
