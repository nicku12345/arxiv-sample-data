We show that a holomorphic mapping sending one generic submanifold into another of the same dimension is CR transversal to the target submanifold provided that the source manifold is of finite type and the map is of generic full rank. This result and its corollaries completely resolve two questions posed by Linda P. Rothschild and the first author in a paper from 2006.
