For \gamma\in\IC such that |\gamma|<\pi/2 and 0\leq\beta<1, let {\mathcal P}_{\gamma,\beta}  denote the class of all analytic functions P in the unit disk \mathbb{D} with P(0)=1 and  {\rm Re\,} \left (e^{i\gamma}P(z)\right)>\beta\cos\gamma \quad \mbox{ in {\mathbb D}}.  For any fixed z_0\in\mathbb{D} and \lambda\in\overline{\mathbb{D}}, we shall determine the region of variability V_{\mathcal{P}}(z_0,\lambda) for \int_0^{z_0}P(\zeta)\,d\zeta when P ranges over the class  \mathcal{P}(\lambda) = \left\{ P\in{\mathcal P}_{\gamma,\beta} :\, P'(0)=2(1-\beta)\lambda e^{-i\gamma}\cos\gamma \right\}.  As a consequence, we present the region of variability for some subclasses of univalent functions. We also graphically illustrate the region of variability for several sets of parameters.
