Biquaternionic Vekua-type equations arising from the factorization of linear second order elliptic operators are studied. Some concepts from classical pseudoanalytic function theory are generalized onto the considered spatial case. The derivative and antiderivative of a spatial pseudoanalytic function are introduced and their applications to the second order elliptic equations are considered.
