The celebrated Paley-Wiener theorem naturally identifies the spaces of bandlimited functions with subspaces of entire functions of exponential type. Recently, it has been shown that these spaces remain invariant only under composition with affine maps. After some motivation demonstrating the importance of characterization of range spaces of bandlimited functions, in this paper we identify the subspaces of  L^2 (\mathbb{R})  generated by these action. Extension of these theorems where Paley-Wiener spaces are replaced by the deBranges-Rovnyak spaces are given.
