Let \Gamma  be a C^\infty  curve in \Bbb{C} containing 0; it becomes \Gamma_\theta  after rotation by angle \theta  about 0. Suppose a C^\infty  function f can be extended holomorphically to a neighborhood of each element of the family \{\Gamma_\theta \}. We prove that under some conditions on \Gamma  the function f is necessarily holomorphic in a neighborhood of the origin. In case \Gamma  is a straight segment the well known Bochnak-Siciak Theorem gives such a proof for \textit{real analyticity}. We also provide several other results related to testing holomorphy property on a family of certain subsets of a domain in \Bbb{C}.
