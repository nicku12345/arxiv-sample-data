An L^2 version of the Serre duality on domains in complex manifolds involving duality of Hilbert space realizations of the \bar{\partial}-operator is established. This duality is used to study the solution of the \bar{\partial}-equation with prescribed support. Applications are given to \bar{\partial}-closed extension of forms, as well to Bochner-Hartogs type extension of CR functions.
