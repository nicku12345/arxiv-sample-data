We solve the several complex variables preSchwarzian operator equation [Df(z)]^{-1}D^2f(z)=A(z), z\in \C^n, where A(z) is a bilinear operator and f is a \C^n valued locally biholomorphic function on a domain in \C^n. Then one can define a several variables f\to f_\alpha transform via the operator equation [Df_\alpha(z)]^{-1}D^2f_\alpha(z)=\alpha[Df(z)]^{-1}D^2f(z), and thereby, study properties of f_\alpha. This is a natural generalization of the one variable operator f_\alpha(z) in \cite{DSS66} and the study of its univalence properties, e.g., the work of Royster \cite{Ro65} and many others. M\"{o}bius invariance and the multivariables Schwarzian derivative operator of T. Oda \cite{O} play a central role in this work.
