The quotient of the Szeg\"{o} and Bergman kernels for a smooth bounded pseudoconvex domains in {\mathbb C}^n is bounded from above by \delta|\log\delta|^p for any p>n, where \delta is the distance to the boundary. For a class of domains that includes those of D'Angelo finite type and those with plurisubharmonic defining functions, the quotient is also bounded from below by \delta|\log\delta|^p for any p<-1. Moreover, for convex domains, the quotient is bounded from above and below by constant multiples of \delta.
