Suppose that X is an analytic subvariety of a Stein manifold M and that \varphi is a plurisubharmonic (psh) function on X which is dominated by a continuous psh exhaustion function u of M. Given any number c>1, we show that \varphi admits a psh extension to M which is dominated by cu on M.   We use this result to prove that any \omega-psh function on a subvariety of the complex projective space is the restriction of a global \omega-psh function, where \omega is the Fubini-Study K\"ahler form.
