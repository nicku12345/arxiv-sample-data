We propose to visualize complex (meromorphic) functions f by their phase P_f:=f/|f|. Color--coding the points on the unit circle converts the function P_f to an image (the phase plot of f), which represents the function directly on its domain. We discuss how special properties of f are reflected by their phase plots and indicate several applications. In particular we reformulate a universality theorem for Riemann's Zeta function in the language of phase plots.
