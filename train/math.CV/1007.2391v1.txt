For probability measures \mu on compact subsets of \CC^n we define two functionals J(\mu) and W(\mu) modeled on discrete approximations to \mu and multivariate Vandermonde determinants. We show that these functionals coincide, up to a constant, with the electrostatic energy of \mu defined in a more general setting by Berman, Boucksom, Guedj and Zeriahi. This generalizes the classical notion of logarithmic energy of a measure in the complex plane; i.e., the case n=1.
