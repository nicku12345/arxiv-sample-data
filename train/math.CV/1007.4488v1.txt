Let X be a Hermitian complex space of pure dimension n. We show that the d-bar-Neumann operator on (p,q)-forms is compact at isolated singularities of X if q>0 and p+q is not equal to n-1 or n. The main step is the construction of compact solution operators for the d-bar-equation on such spaces which is based on a general characterization of compactness in function spaces on singular spaces, and that leads also to a criterion for compactness of more general Green operators on singular spaces.
