The Roper--Suffridge extension operator and its modifications are powerful tools to construct biholomorphic mappings with special geometric properties.   The first purpose of this paper is to analyze common properties of different extension operators and to define an extension operator for biholomorphic mappings on the open unit ball of an arbitrary complex Banach space. The second purpose is to study extension operators for starlike, spirallike and convex in one direction mappings. In particular, we show that the extension of each spirallike mapping is A-spirallike for a variety of linear operators A.   Our approach is based on a connection of special classes of biholomorphic mappings defined on the open unit ball of a complex Banach space with semigroups acting on this ball.
