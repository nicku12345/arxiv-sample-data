The paper establishes the existence of homeomorphisms between two planar domains that minimize the Dirichlet energy. Specifically, among all homeomorphisms f : R -> R* between bounded doubly connected domains such that Mod (R) < Mod (R*) there exists, unique up to conformal authomorphisms of R, an energy-minimal diffeomorphism. No boundary conditions are imposed on f. Although any energy-minimal diffeomorphism is harmonic, our results underline the major difference between the existence of harmonic diffeomorphisms and the existence of the energy-minimal diffeomorphisms. The existence of globally invertible energy-minimal mappings is of primary pursuit in the mathematical models of nonlinear elasticity and is also of interest in computer graphics.
