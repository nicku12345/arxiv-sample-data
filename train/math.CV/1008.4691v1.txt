In this paper we introduce and study two new subclasses \Sigma_{\lambda\mu mp}(\alpha,\beta) and \Sigma^{+}_{\lambda\mu mp}(\alpha,\beta) of meromorphically multivalent functions which are defined by means of a new differential operator. Some results connected to subordination properties, coefficient estimates, convolution properties, integral representation, distortion theorems are obtained. We also extend the familiar concept of % (n,\delta)-neighborhoods of analytic functions to these subclasses of meromorphically multivalent functions.
