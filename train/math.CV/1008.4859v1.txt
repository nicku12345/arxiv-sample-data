Let \ID denote the open unit disc and let p\in (0,1). We consider the family Co(p) of functions f:\ID\to \overline{\IC} that satisfy the following conditions: \bee \item[(i)] f is meromorphic in \ID and has a simple pole at the point p. \item[(ii)] f(0)=f'(0)-1=0. \item[(iii)] f maps \ID conformally onto a set whose complement with respect to \overline{\IC} is convex. \eee We determine the exact domains of variability of some coefficients a_n(f) of the Laurent expansion f(z)=\sum_{n=-1}^{\infty} a_n(f)(z-p)^n,\quad |z-p|<1-p,  for f\in Co(p) and certain values of p. Knowledge on these Laurent coefficients is used to disprove a conjecture of the third author on the closed convex hull of Co(p) for certain values of p.
