Let \ID denote the open unit disk and f:\,\ID\TO\BAR\IC be meromorphic and univalent in \ID with the simple pole at p\in (0,1) and satisfying the standard normalization f(0)=f'(0)-1=0. Also, let f have the expansion f(z)=\sum_{n=-1}^{\infty}a_n(z-p)^n,\quad |z-p|<1-p,  such that f maps \ID onto a domain whose complement with respect to \BAR{\IC} is a convex set (starlike set with respect to a point w_0\in \IC, w_0\neq 0 resp.). We call these functions as concave (meromorphically starlike resp.) univalent functions and denote this class by Co(p) (\Sigma^s(p, w_0) resp.). We prove some coefficient estimates for functions in the classes where the sharpness of these estimates is also achieved.
