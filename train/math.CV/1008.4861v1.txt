Let Co(\alpha) denote the class of concave univalent functions in the unit disk \ID. Each function f\in Co(\alpha) maps the unit disk \ID onto the complement of an unbounded convex set. In this paper we find the exact disk of variability for the functional (1-|z|^2)\left ( f''(z)/f'(z)\right), f\in Co(\alpha). In particular, this gives sharp upper and lower estimates for the pre-Schwarzian norm of concave univalent functions. Next we obtain the set of variability of the functional (1-|z|^2)\left(f''(z)/f'(z)\right), f\in Co(\alpha) whenever f''(0) is fixed. We also give a characterization for concave functions in terms of Hadamard convolution. In addition to sharp coefficient inequalities, we prove that functions in Co(\alpha) belong to the H^p space for p<1/\alpha.
