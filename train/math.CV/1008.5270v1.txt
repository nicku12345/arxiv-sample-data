We consider the class of meromorphic univalent functions having a simple pole at p\in(0,1) and that map the unit disc onto the exterior of a domain which is starlike with respect to a point w_0 \neq 0,\, \infty. We denote this class of functions by \Sigma^*(p,w_0). In this paper, we find the exact region of variability for the second Taylor coefficient for functions in \Sigma^*(p,w_0). In view of this result we rectify some results of James Miller.
