Line integration of generalized functions is studied. Second order partial differential equations with piecewise continuous and generalized variable coefficients over Cayley-Dickson algebras are investigated. Formulas for integrations of such equations are deduced. For this purpose a non-commutative line integration is used. Examples of solutions of partial differential equations are given.
