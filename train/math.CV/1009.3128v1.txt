For weighted Toeplitz operators \T^N_\phi defined on spaces of holomorphic functions in the unit ball, we derive regularity properties of the solutions f to the integral equation \T^N_\phi(f)=h in terms of the regularity of the symbol \phi and the data h. As an application, we deduce that if f\not\equiv0 is a function in the Hardy space H^1 such that its argument \bar f/f is in a Lipschitz space on the unit sphere \bB, then f is also in the same Lipschitz space, extending a result of K. Dyakonov to several complex variables.
