Let S_i, i\in I, be a countable collection of Jordan curves in the extended complex plane \Sph that bound pairwise disjoint closed Jordan regions. If the Jordan curves are uniform quasicircles and are uniformly relatively separated, then there exists a quasiconformal map f\: \Sph\ra \Sph such that f(S_i) is a round circle for all i\in I. This implies that every Sierpi\'nski carpet in \oC whose peripheral circles are uniformly relatively separated uniform quasicircles can be mapped to a round Sierpi\'nski carpet by a quasisymmetric map.
