Let \alpha\in(0,1)\setminus{\Bbb Q} and K=\{(e^z,e^{\alpha z}):\,|z|\leq1\}\subset{\Bbb C}^2. If P is a polynomial of degree n in {\Bbb C}^2, normalized by \|P\|_K=1, we obtain sharp estimates for \|P\|_{\Delta^2} in terms of n, where \Delta^2 is the closed unit bidisk. For most \alpha, we show that \sup_P\|P\|_{\Delta^2}\leq\exp(Cn^2\log n). However, for \alpha in a subset {\mathcal S} of the Liouville numbers, \sup_P\|P\|_{\Delta^2} has bigger order of growth. We give a precise characterization of the set {\mathcal S} and study its properties.
