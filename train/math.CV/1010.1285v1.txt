We study functions which are the pointwise limit of a sequence of holomorphic functions. In one complex variable this is a classical topic, though we offer some new points of view and new results. Some novel results for solutions of elliptic equations will be treated. In several complex variables the question seems to be new, and we explore some new avenues.
