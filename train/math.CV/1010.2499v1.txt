We show that the equality m_1(f(x))=m_2(g(x)) for x in a neighborhood of a point a remains valid for all x provided that f and g are open holomorphic maps, f(a)=g(a)=0 and m_1, m_2 are Minkowski functionals of bounded balanced domains. Moreover, a polynomial relation between f and g is obtained. Next we generalize these results to bounded quasi-balanced domains.   Moreover, the main results of \cite{Ber-Piz} and \cite{Bou} are significantly extended and their proofs are essentially simplified.
