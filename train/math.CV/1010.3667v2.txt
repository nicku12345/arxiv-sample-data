We characterize the existence of proper holomorphic mappings in the special class of bounded (1,2,...,n)-balanced domains in \mathbb{C}^n, called the symmetrized ellipsoids. Using this result we conclude that there are no non-trivial proper holomorphic self-mappings in the class of symmetrized ellipsoids. We also describe the automorphism groupof these domains.
