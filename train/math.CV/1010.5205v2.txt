We provide some conditions for the graph of a Hoelder-continuous function on \bar{D}, where \bar{D} is a closed disc in the complex plane, to be polynomially convex. Almost all sufficient conditions known to date --- provided the function (say F) is smooth --- arise from versions of the Weierstrass Approximation Theorem on \bar{D}. These conditions often fail to yield any conclusion if rank_R(DF) is not maximal on a sufficiently large subset of \bar{D}. We bypass this difficulty by introducing a technique that relies on the interplay of certain plurisubharmonic functions. This technique also allows us to make some observations on the polynomial hull of a graph in C^2 at an isolated complex tangency.
