We prove the following theorem: every quasiconformal harmonic mapping between two plane domains with C^{1,\alpha} (\alpha<1), respectively C^{1,1} compact boundary is bi-Lipschitz. The distance function with respect to the boundary of the image domain is used. This in turn extends a similar result of the author in \cite{kalajan} for Jordan domains, where stronger boundary conditions for the image domain were needed.
