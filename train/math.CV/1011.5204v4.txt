In this paper we discus the radial extension w of a bi-Lipschitz parameterization F(e^{it})=f(t) of a starlike Jordan curve \gamma w.r. to 0. We show that, if parameterization is bi-Lipschitz, then the extension is bi-Lipschitz and consequently quasiconformal. If \gamma is the unit circle, then \mathrm{Lip}(f)=\mathrm{Lip}(F)=\mathrm{Lip}(w)=K_w. If \gamma is not a circle centered at origin, and F is a polar parametrization of \gamma, then we show that \mathrm{Lip}(f)=\mathrm{Lip}(F)<\mathrm{Lip}(w).
