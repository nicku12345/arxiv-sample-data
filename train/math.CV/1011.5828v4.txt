The purpose of this article is to study the uniqueness problem for meromorphic mappings from \mathbb{C}^{n} into the complex projective space \mathbb{P}^{N}(\mathbb{C}). By making using of the method of dealing with multiple values due to L. Yang and the technique of Dethloff-Quang-Tan respectively, we obtain two general uniqueness theorems which improve and extend some known results of meromorphic mappings sharing hyperplanes in general position.
