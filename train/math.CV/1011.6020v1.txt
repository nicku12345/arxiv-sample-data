We characterize the spectra of composition operators on the Hardy space H^2(B_N), when the symbols are elliptic or hyperbolic linear fractional self-maps of B_N. Therefore, combining with the result obtained by Bayart \cite{B10}, the spectra of all linear fractional composition operators on H^2(B_N) are completely determined.
