Some new results on the convergence of nonlinear diagonal Pad\'e--Chebyshev approximations to multivalued analytic function given on the segment [-1,1], are proved. We show that these approximations converge to the given function in the "maxmimal" domain of its meromorphity and that the boundary of this maxmimal domain is an S-curve.
