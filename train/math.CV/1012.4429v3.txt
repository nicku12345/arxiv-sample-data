A complex Lie supergroup can be described as a real Lie supergroup with integrable almost complex structure. The necessary and sufficient conditions on an almost complex structure on a real Lie supergroup for defining a complex Lie supergroup are deduced. The classification of real Lie supergroups with such almost complex structures yields a new approach to the known classification of complex Lie supergroups by complex Harish-Chandra superpairs. A universal complexification of a real Lie supergroup is constructed.
