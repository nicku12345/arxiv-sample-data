It is stated equicontinuity and normality of families \frak{F}^{\Phi} of the so--called homeomorphisms with finite distortion on conditions that K_{f}(z) has finite mean oscillation, singularities of logarithmic type or integral constraints of the type \int\Phi\left(K_{f}(z)\right)dx\,dy<\infty in a domain D\subset{\C}. It is shown that the found conditions on the function \Phi are not only sufficient but also necessary for equicontinuity and normality of such families of mappings.
