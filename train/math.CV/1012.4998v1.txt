The main aim of this paper is to construct explicitly orthogonal bases for the spaces of k-homogeneous polynomial solutions of the Hodge-de Rham system in the Euclidean space R^m which take values in the space of s-vectors. Actually, we describe even the so-called Gelfand-Tsetlin bases for such spaces in terms of Gegenbauer polynomials. As an application, we obtain an algorithm how to compute an orthogonal basis of the space of homogeneous solutions of a generalized Moisil-Theodoresco system in R^m.
