First of all, we prove that open mappings in Orlicz-Sobolev classes W^{1,\phi}_{\rm loc} under the Calderon type condition on \phi have the total differential a.e. that is a generalization of the well-known theorems of Gehring-Lehto-Menchoff in the plane and of V\"ais\"al\"a in {\Bbb R}^n, n\geqslant3. Under the same condition on \phi, we show that continuous mappings f in W^{1,\phi}_{\rm loc}, in particular, f\in W^{1,p}_{\rm loc} for p>n-1 have the (N)-property by Lusin on a.e. hyperplane. Our examples demonstrate that the Calderon type condition is not only sufficient but also necessary for this and, in particular, there exist homeomorphisms in W^{1,n-1}_{\rm loc} which have not the (N)-property with respect to the (n-1)-dimensional Hausdorff measure on a.e. hyperplane. It is proved on this base that under this condition on \phi the homeomorphisms f with finite distortion in W^{1,\phi}_{\rm loc} and, in particular, f\in W^{1,p}_{\rm loc} for p>n-1 are the so-called lower Q-homeomorphisms where Q(x) is equal to its outer dilatation K_f(x) as well as the so-called ring Q_*-homeomorphisms with Q_*(x)=[K_{f}(x)]^{n-1}. This makes possible to apply our theory of the local and boundary behavior of the lower and ring Q-homeomorphisms to homeomorphisms with finite distortion in the Orlicz-Sobolev classes.
