In a holomorphic family (X_b)_{b\in B} of non-K\"ahlerian compact manifolds, the holomorphic curves representing a fixed 2-homology class do not form a proper family in general. The deep source of this fundamental difficulty in non-K\"ahler geometry is the {\it explosion of the area} phenomenon: the area of a curve C_b\subset X_b in a fixed 2-homology class can diverge as b\to b_0. This phenomenon occurs frequently in the deformation theory of class VII surfaces. For instance it is well known that any minimal GSS surface X_0 is a degeneration of a 1-parameter family of simply blown up primary Hopf surfaces (X_z)_{z\in D\setminus\{0\}}, so one obtains non-proper families of exceptional divisors E_z\subset X_z whose area diverge as z\to 0. Our main goal is to study in detail this non-properness phenomenon in the case of class VII surfaces. We will prove that, under certain technical assumptions, a lift \widetilde E_z of E_z in the universal cover \widetilde X_z does converge to an effective divisor \widetilde E_0 in \widetilde X_0, but this limit divisor is not compact. We prove that this limit divisor is always bounded towards the pseudo-convex end of \widetilde X_0 and that, when X_0 is a a minimal surface with global spherical shell, it is given by an infinite series of {\it compact} rational curves, whose coefficients can be computed explicitly. This phenomenon - degeneration of a family of compact curves to an infinite union of compact curves - should be called {\it infinite bubbling}.   We believe that such a decomposition result holds for any family of class VII surfaces whose generic fiber is a blown up primary Hopf surface. This statement would have important consequences for the classification of class VII surfaces.
