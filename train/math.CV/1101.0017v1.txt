This note is aimed at simplifying current literature about compactness estimates for the Kohn-Laplacian on CR manifolds. The approach consists in a tangential basic estimate in the formulation given by the first author in \cite{Kh10} which refines former work by Nicoara \cite{N06}. It has been proved by Raich \cite{R10} that on a CR manifold of dimension 2n-1 which is compact pseudoconvex of hypersurface type embedded in \C^n and orientable, the property named "(CR-P_q)" for 1\leq q\leq \frac{n-1}2, a generalization of the one introduced by Catlin in \cite{C84}, implies compactness estimates for the Kohn-Laplacian \Box_b in degree k for any k satisfying q\leq k\leq n-1-q. The same result is stated by Straube in \cite{S10} without the assumption of orientability. We regain these results by a simplified method and extend the conclusions in two directions. First, the CR manifold is no longer required to be embedded. Second, when (CR-P_q) holds for q=1 (and, in case n=1, under the additional hypothesis that \dib_b has closed range on functions) we prove compactness also in the critical degrees k=0 and k=n-1.
