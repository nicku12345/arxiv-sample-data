We show that a strongly \lambda-spirallike function of order \alpha can be extended to a \sin(\pi\alpha/2)-quasiconformal automorphism of the complex plane for -\pi/2<\lambda<\pi/2 and 0<\alpha<1 with |\lambda|<\pi\alpha/2. In order to prove it, we provide several geometric characterizations of a strongly \lambda-spirallike domain of order \alpha. We also give a concrete form of the mapping function of the standard strongly \lambda-spirallike domain U_{\lambda,\alpha} of order \alpha. A key tool of the present study is the notion of \lambda-argument, which was developed by Y. C. Kim and the author.
