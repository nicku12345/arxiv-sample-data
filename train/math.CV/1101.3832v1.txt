For an analytic function f(z) on the unit disk |z|<1 with f(0)=f'(0)-1=0 and f(z)\ne0, 0<|z|<1, we consider the power deformation f_c(z)=z(f(z)/z)^c for a complex number c. We determine those values c for which the operator f\mapsto f_c maps a specified class of univalent functions into the class of univalent functions. A little surprisingly, we will see that the set is described by the variability region of the quantity zf'(z)/f(z),~|z|<1, for the class in most cases which we consider in the present paper. As an unexpected by-product, we show boundedness of strongly spirallike functions.
