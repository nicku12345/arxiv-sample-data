Let D be a strictly convex domain and X be a singular analytic subset of C^2 such that the intersection of X and D is non empty. We give conditions under which a function holomophic on the intersection of X and D can be extended holomorphically to D with growth estimates of BMO or L^q type. The extension is given by mean of integral representation formulas and new residual currents.
