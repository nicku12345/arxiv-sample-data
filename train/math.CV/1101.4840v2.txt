Let \Omega \subset \mathbb{C}^n be a bounded domain and let \mathcal{A} \subset \mathcal{C}(\bar{\Omega}) be a uniform algebra generated by a set F of holomorphic and pluriharmonic functions. Under natural assumptions on \Omega and F we show that the only obstruction to \mathcal{A} = \mathcal{C}(\bar{\Omega}) is that there is a holomorphic disk D \subset \bar{\Omega} such that all functions in F are holomorphic on D, i.e., the only obstruction is the obvious one. This generalizes work by A. Izzo. We also have a generalization of Wermer's maximality theorem to the (distinguished boundary of the) bidisk.
