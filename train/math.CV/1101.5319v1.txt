In this paper we present a result about analytic functions f defined on the open unit disc and with a finite number of exceptional values containedin the real interval (0, 1). We find an upper bound for the modulus of f' in 0. This bound is sharp in the case of one exceptional value. We also analyzed the case of two exceptional values.
