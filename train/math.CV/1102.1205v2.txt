In this paper we study a generalization of the classical Rarita-Schwinger type operators and construct their fundamental solutions. We give some basic integral formulas related to these operators. We also establish that the projection operators appearing in the Rarita-Schwinger operators and the Rarita-Schwinger equations are conformally invariant. We further obtain the intertwining operators for other operators related to the Rarita-Schwinger operators under actions of the conformal group.
