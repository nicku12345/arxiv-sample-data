In this paper we aim at constructing a sequence \{\mathsf{M}_n^k(x)\}_{n\ge0} of \mathbb R_{0,m}-valued polynomials which are monogenic in \mathbb R^{m+1} satisfying the Appell condition (i.e. the hypercomplex derivative of each polynomial in the sequence equals, up to a multiplicative constant, its preceding term) but whose first term \mathsf{M}_0^k(x)=\mathbf{P}_k(\underline x) is a \mathbb R_{0,m}-valued homogeneous monogenic polynomial in \mathbb R^m of degree k and not a constant like in the classical case. The connection of this sequence with the so-called Fueter's theorem will also be discussed.
