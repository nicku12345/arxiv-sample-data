In this paper, we focus on the existence of accumulation points of the subset defined by the real projection of the zeros of the partial sums of the Riemann zeta functions. That would imply the existence of an infinite amount of zeros of the partial sums of the Riemann zeta functions arbitrarily close to a line parallel to the imaginary axis passing through every accumulation point.
