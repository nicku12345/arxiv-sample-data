This paper is a continuation of [D. Pe\~{n}a Pe\~{n}a, On a sequence of monogenic polynomials satisfying the Appell condition whose first term is a non-constant function, arXiv:1102.1833], in which we prove that for every monogenic polynomial \mathbf{P}_k(x) of degree k in \mathbb R^{m+1} there exists a sequence of monogenic polynomials \{M_n(x)\}_{n\ge0} satisfying the Appell condition such that M_0(x)=\mathbf{P}_k(x).
