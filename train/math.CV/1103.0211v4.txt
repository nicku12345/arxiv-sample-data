We prove that the Kobayashi distance near boundary of a pseudoconvex Reinhardt domain D increases asymptotically at most like -\log d_D+C. Moreover, for boundary points from \text{int}\bar{D} the growth does not exceed 1/2\log(-\log d_D)+C. The lower estimate by -1/2\log d_D+C is obtained under additional assumptions of \mathcal C^1-smoothness of a domain and a non-tangential convergence.
