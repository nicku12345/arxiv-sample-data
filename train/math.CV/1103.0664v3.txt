We call every complex connected (1,1)-dimensional supermanifold a super Riemann surface and construct versal super families of compact ones, where the base spaces are allowed to be certain ringed spaces including all complex supermanifolds. Furthermore we choose maximal supersymmetric sub super families which turn out to be versal among all supersymmetric super families. In the cases where special divisors occur we prove the non-existence of versal super families and instead construct locally complete ones. For an accurate study of supersymmetric super families we introduce the duality functor, a covariant involution of the category of super families of compact super Riemann surfaces, and show that the supersymmetric super families are essentially the self-dual ones. As an application of the classification results it is shown that on a supersymmetric super family of compact super Riemann surfaces locally in the base the supersymmetry is uniquely determined up to pullback by automorphisms with identity as body.
