In this paper we obtain, by the method of Loewner chains, some sufficient conditions for the analyticity and the univalence of the functions defined by an integral operator. These conditions in- volves Ruscheweyh and Salagean derivative operator in the open unit disk. In particular cases, we find the well-known conditions for univalency established by Becker [3], Ahlfors [2], Kanas and Srivastava [8] and others for analytic mappings f : U ! C: Also, we obtain the corresponding new, useful and simpler conditions for this integral operator.
