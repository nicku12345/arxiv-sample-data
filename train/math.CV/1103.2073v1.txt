We discuss families of meromorphic functions f_h obtained from single functions f by the re-scaling process f_h(z)=h^{-\alpha}f(h+h^{-\beta}z) generalising Yosida's process f_h(z)=f(h+z). The main objective is to obtain information on the value distribution of the generating functions f themselves. Among the most prominent generalised Yosida functions are first, second and fourth Painlev\'e transcendents. The Yosida class contains all limit functions of generalised Yosida functions--the Yosida class is universal.
