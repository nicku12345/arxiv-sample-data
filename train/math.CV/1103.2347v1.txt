We study Banach-valued holomorphic functions defined on open subsets of the maximal ideal space of the Banach algebra H^\infty of bounded holomorphic functions on the unit disk D\subset C with pointwise multiplication and supremum norm. In particular, we establish vanishing cohomology for sheaves of germs of such functions and, solving a Banach-valued corona problem for H^\infty, prove that the maximal ideal space of the algebra H_{\rm comp}^\infty (A) of holomorphic functions on \Di with relatively compact images in a commutative unital complex Banach algebra A is homeomorphic to the direct product of maximal ideal spaces of H^\infty and A.
