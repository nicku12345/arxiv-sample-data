The present paper is devoted to the study of space mappings, which are more general than quasiregular mappings. The questions of the behavior of differentiable mappings having the so--called N, N^{-1}, ACP and ACP^{-1} -- properties are studied in the work. Under some additional conditions, it is showed that the modulus of such mappings f can be more than each degree of logarithmic function at every neighborhood of the isolated essential singularity of f.
