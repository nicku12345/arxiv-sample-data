We show that many functions containing W are Stieltjes functions. Explicit Stieltjes integrals are given for functions 1/W(z), W(z)/z, and others. We also prove a generalization of a conjecture of Jackson, Procacci & Sokal. Integral representations of W and related functions are also given which are associated with the properties of their being Pick or Bernstein functions. Representations based on Poisson and Burniston--Siewert integrals are given as well.
