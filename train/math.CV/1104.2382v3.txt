We show that if a complex entire function f and its derivative f' share their simple zeroes and their simple a-points for some nonzero constant a, then f\equiv f'. We also discuss how far these conditions can be relaxed or generalized. Finally, we determine all entire functions f such that for 3 distinct complex numbers a_1,a_2,a_3 every simple a_j-point of f is an a_j-point of f'.
