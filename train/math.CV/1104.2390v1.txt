We give several characterizations of holomorphic mean Besov-Lipschitz space on the unit ball in \cn  and appropriate Besov-Lipschitz space and prove the equivalences between them. Equivalent norms on the mean Besov-Lipschitz space involve different types of L^p-moduli of continuity, while in characterizations of Besov-Lipschitz space we use not only the radial derivative but also the gradient and the tangential derivatives. The characterization in terms of the best approximation by polynomials is also given.
