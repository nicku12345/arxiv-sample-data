For \sigma\in (0,+\infty), denote by B_\sigma^{\infty} the Bernstein space (of type \sigma) of all entire functions of exponential type \leq \sigma bounded on real axis \R. Let I_d\subset \R be a segment of length d>0. We announce complete description of non-uniqueness sequences of points for B_\sigma^\infty and criteria of completeness of exponential system in C(I_d) or L^p(I_d) to within one or two exponential functions.
