Given a holomorphic line bundle over the complex affine quadric Q^2, we investigate its Stein, SU(2)-equivariant disc bundles. Up to equivariant biholomorphism, these are all contained in a maximal one, say \Omega_{max}. By removing the zero section to \Omega_{max} one obtains the unique Stein, SU(2)-equivariant, punctured disc bundle over Q^2 which contains entire curves. All other such punctured disc bundles are shown to be Kobayashi hyperbolic.
