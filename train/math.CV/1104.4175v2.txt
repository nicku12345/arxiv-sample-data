When Newton's method, or Halley's method is used to approximate the p{th} root of 1-z, a sequence of rational functions is obtained. In this paper, a beautiful formula for these rational functions is proved in the square root case, using an interesting link to Chebyshev's polynomials. It allows the determination of the sign of the coefficients of the power series expansion of these rational functions. This answers positively the square root case of a proposed conjecture by Guo(2010).
