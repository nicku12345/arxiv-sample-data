We give a short survey on generalizations of Nevanlinna's theorems on zero distribution of bounded holomorphic functions and representation of meromorphic functions in multiply connected domains. It is a part of our report in the conference on complex analysis dedicated to the memory of Anatolii Asirovich Goldberg in Lviv, May 31-June 5, 2010.
