The subordination principle states roughly : if a property is true for Hardy spaces in some kind of domains in C^n then it is also true for the Bergman spaces of the same kind of domains in C^{n-1}. We give applications of this principle to Bergman-Carleson measures, interpolating sequences for Bergman spaces, A^p Corona theorem and characterization of the zeros set of Bergman-Nevanlinna class.
