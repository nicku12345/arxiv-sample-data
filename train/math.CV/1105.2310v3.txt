Given a semianalytic set S in a complex space and a point p in S, there is a unique smallest complex-analytic germ at p which contains the germ of S, called the holomorphic closure of S at p. We show that if S is semialgebraic then its holomorphic closure is a Nash germ, for every p, and S admits a semialgebraic filtration by the holomorphic closure dimension. As a consequence, every semialgebraic subset of a complex vector space admits a semialgebraic stratification into CR manifolds satisfying a strong version of the condition of the frontier.
