Let D be a bounded domain in a complex Banach space. According to the Earle-Hamilton fixed point theorem, if a holomorphic mapping F : D \mapsto D maps D strictly into itself, then it has a unique fixed point and its iterates converge to this fixed point locally uniformly. Now let \mathcal{B} be the open unit ball in a complex Hilbert space and let F : \mathcal{B} \mapsto \mathcal{B} be holomorphic. We show that a similar conclusion holds even if the image F(\mathcal{B}) is not strictly inside \mathcal{B}, but is contained in a horosphere internally tangent to the boundary of \mathcal{B}. This geometric condition is equivalent to the fact that F is asymptotically strongly nonexpansive with respect to the hyperbolic metric in \mathcal{B}.
