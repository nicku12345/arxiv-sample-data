In this paper we prove an isoperimetric inequality for holomorphic functions in the unit polydisc \mathbf U^n. As a corollary we derive an inclusion relation between weighted Bergman and Hardy spaces of holomorphic functions in the polydisc which generalizes the classical Hardy--Littlewood relation H^p\subseteq A^{2p}. Also, we extend some results due to Burbea.
