In this paper, we introduce a way to generalize the Euler's gamma function as well as some related special functions. With a given polynomial in one variable f(t)\ge 0, we can associate a function, so-called "gamma function associated with f", defined by \Gamma_f(s) := \int_0^\infty f^{s-1} e^{-t} dt. This function has many features similar to the Euler's gamma function. We also present some initial results on the gamma-type functional equation for \Gamma_f(s) in some special cases.
