In this paper we study some operators associated to the Rarita-Schwinger operators. They arise from the difference between the Dirac operator and the Rarita-Schwinger operators. These operators are called remaining operators. They are based on the Dirac operator and projection operators I-P_k. The fundamental solutions of these operators are harmonic polynomials, homogeneous of degree k. First we study the remaining operators and their representation theory in Euclidean space. Second, we can extend the remaining operators in Euclidean space to the sphere under the Cayley transformation.
