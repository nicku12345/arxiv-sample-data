Sendov conjecture tells that if P denotes a complex polynomial having all his zeros in the closed unit disk and a denote a zero of P, the closed disk of center a and radius 1 contains a zero of the derivative P'. The main result of this paper is a proof of Sendov conjecture when the polynomial P has a degree higher than a fixed integer N. We will give estimates of its integer N in terms of |a|. To obtain this result, we will study the geometry of the zeros and critical points (i.e. zeros of P') of a polynomial which would contradict Sendov conjecture.
