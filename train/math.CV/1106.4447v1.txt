We consider holomorphic mappings H between a smooth real hypersurface M\subset \bC^{n+1} and another M'\subset \bC^{N+1} with N\geq n. We provide conditions guaranteeing that H is transversal to M' along all of M. In the strictly pseudoconvex case, this is well known and follows from the classical Hopf boundary lemma. In the equidimensional case (N=n), transversality holds for maps of full generic rank provided that the source is of finite type in view of recent results by the authors (see also a previous paper by the first author and L. Rothschild). In the positive codimensional case (N>n), the situation is more delicate as examples readily show. In recent work by S. Baouendi, the first author, and L. Rothschild, conditions were given guaranteeing that the map H is transversal outside a proper subvariety of M, and examples were given showing that transversality may fail at certain points.   One of the results in this paper implies that if N\le 2n-2, M' is Levi-nondegenerate, and H has maximal rank outside a complex subvariety of codimension 2, then H is transversal to M' at all points of M. We show by examples that this conclusion fails in general if N\geq 2n, or if the set W_H of points where H is not of maximal rank has codimension one. We also show that H is transversal at all points if H is assumed to be a finite map (which allows W_H to have codimension one) and the stronger inequality N\leq 2n-3 holds, provided that M is of finite type.
