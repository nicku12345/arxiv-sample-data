We investigate the behaviour of the Oka property with respect to deformations of compact complex manifolds. We show that in a family of compact complex manifolds, the set of Oka fibres corresponds to a G-delta subset of the base. We give a necessary and sufficient condition for the limit fibre of a sequence of Oka fibres to be Oka in terms of a new uniform Oka property. We show that if the fibres are tori, then the projection is an Oka map. Finally, we consider holomorphic submersions with noncompact fibres.
