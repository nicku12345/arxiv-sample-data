Let U be a multiply connected domain of the Riemann sphere \hat{C} whose complement \hat{C}\setminus U has N<\infty components. We show that every conformal map on U can be written as a composition of N maps conformal on simply connected domains. This improves on a recent result of D.E. Marshall, but our proof uses different ideas, and involves the uniformisation theorem for Riemann surfaces.
