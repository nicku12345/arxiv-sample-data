Let {\mathcal H} denote the class of all normalized complex-valued harmonic functions f=h+\bar{g} in the unit disk {\mathbb D}, and let K=H+\bar{G} denote the harmonic Koebe function. Let a_n,b_n, A_n, B_n denote the Maclaurin coefficients of h,g,H,G, and {\mathcal F}=\{f=h+\bar{g}\in {\mathcal H}:\,|a_n|\leq A_n and |b_n|\leq B_n for n\geq 1}.  We show that the radius of univalence of the family {\mathcal F} is 0.112903.... We also show that this number is also the radius of the starlikeness of {\mathcal F}. Analogous results are proved for a subclass of the class of harmonic convex functions in {\mathcal H}. These results are obtained as a consequence of a new coefficient inequality for certain class of harmonic close-to-convex functions. Surprisingly, the new coefficient condition helps to improve Bloch-Landau constant for bounded harmonic mappings.
