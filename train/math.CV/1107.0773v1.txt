We consider the zeros distributions on the derivatives of difference polynomials of meromorphic functions, and present some results which can be seen as the discrete analogues of Hayman conjecture \cite{hayman1}, also partly answer the question given in \cite[P448]{luolin}. We also investigate the uniqueness problems of difference-differential polynomials of entire functions sharing one common value. These theorems improve the results of Luo and Lin\cite{luolin} and some results of present authors \cite{liuliucao}.
