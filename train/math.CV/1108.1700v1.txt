We provide a partial answer to the following problem: \emph{give an effective upper bound on the multiplicity of non-isolated common zero of a tuple of Noetherian functions}. More precisely, consider a foliation defined by two commuting polynomial vector fields V_1,V_2 in \C^n, and p a nonsingular point of the foliation. Denote by \cL the leaf passing through p, and let F,G\in\C[X] be two polynomials. Assume that F\onL=0,G\onL=0 have several common branches. We provide an effective procedure which allows to bound from above multipllicity of intersection of remaining branches of F\onL=0 with G\onL=0 in terms of the degrees and dimensions only.
