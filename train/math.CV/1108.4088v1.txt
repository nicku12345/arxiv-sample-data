Let q_1 and q_2 belong to a certain class of normalized analytic univalent functions in the open unit disk of the complex plane. Sufficient conditions are obtained for normalized analytic functions p to satisfy the double subordination chain q_1(z)\prec p(z)\prec q_2(z). The differential sandwich-type result obtained is applied to normalized univalent functions and to \Phi-like functions.
