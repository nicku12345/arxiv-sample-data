In this paper we give a complete characterization of linear, quadratic, and geometric Legendre multiplier sequences. We also prove that all Legendre multiplier sequences must be Hermite multiplier sequences, and describe the relationship between the Legendre and generalized Laguerre multiplier sequences. We conclude with a list of open questions for further research.
