For 0\leq \alpha <1, the sharp radii of starlikeness and convexity of order \alpha for functions of the form f(z)=z+a_2z^2+a_3z^3+... whose Taylor coefficients a_n satisfy the conditions |a_2|=2b, 0\leq b\leq 1, and |a_n|\leq n , M or M/n (M>0) for n\geq 3 are obtained. Also a class of functions related to Carath\'eodory functions is considered.
