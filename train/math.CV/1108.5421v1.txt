A normalized analytic function f is shown to be univalent in the open unit disk D if its second coefficient is sufficiently small and relates to its Schwarzian derivative through a certain inequality. New criteria for analytic functions to be in certain subclasses of functions are established in terms of the Schwarzian derivatives and the second coefficients. These include obtaining a sufficient condition for functions to be strongly \alpha-Bazilevi\^c of order \beta.
