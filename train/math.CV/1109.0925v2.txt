In this paper, we obtain coefficient criteria for a normalized harmonic function defined in the unit disk to be close-to-convex and fully starlike, respectively. Using these coefficient conditions, we present different classes of harmonic close-to-convex (resp. fully starlike) functions involving Gaussian hypergeometric functions. In addition, we present a convolution characterization for a class of univalent harmonic functions discussed recently by Mocanu, and later by Bshouty and Lyzzaik in 2010. Our approach provide examples of harmonic polynomials that are close-to-convex and starlike, respectively.
