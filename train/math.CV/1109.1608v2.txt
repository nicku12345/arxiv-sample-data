We investigate germs of real analytic Levi-flat hypersurfaces tangent to germs of codimension one holomorphic webs. We introduce the notion of first integrals for local webs. In particular, we prove that a k-web with finitely many invariant analytic subvarieties through the origin tangent to a Levi-flat hypersurface has a holomorphic first integral.
