We obtain a new general sufficient condition for the continuity of the Bergman projection in tube domains over symmetric cones using multifunctional embeddings.We also obtain some sharp embedding relations between the generalized Hilbert-HArdy spaces and the mixed norm Bergman spaces in this setting.
