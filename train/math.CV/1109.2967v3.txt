The regularity of the \bar{\partial}-problem on the domain \{|{z_1}|<|{z_2}|<1\} in \mathbb{C}^2 is studied using L^2 methods. Estimates are obtained for the canonical solution in weighted L^2-Sobolev spaces with a weight that is singular at the point (0,0). The canonical solution for \dbar with weights is exact regular in the weighted Sobolev spaces away from the singularity (0,0). In particular, the singularity of the Bergman projection for the Hartogs triangle is contained at the singular point and it does not propagate.
