Let \mathcal{E}_n be the ring of the germs of \mathcal{C}^\infty-functions at the origin in \R^n. It is well known that if I is an ideal of \mathcal{E}_n, generated by a finite number of germs of analytic functions, then I is closed. In this paper we consider an ideal of \mathcal{E}_n generated by a finite number of germs in some class of \mathcal{C}^\infty-functions that are not analytic in \`a, but quasi-analytic and we shall prove that the result holds in this general situation. We remark that the result is not true for a general ideal of finite type of \mathcal{E}_n.
