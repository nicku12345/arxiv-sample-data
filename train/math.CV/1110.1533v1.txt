Let \Omega\subset\mathbb{C}^n be a bounded domain with smooth boundary, whose Bergman projection B maps the Sobolev space H^{k_{1}}(\Omega) (continuously) into H^{k_{2}}(\Omega). We establish two smoothing results: (i) the full Sobolev norm \|Bf\|_{k_{2}} is controlled by L^2 derivatives of f taken along a single, distinguished direction (of order \leq k_{1}), and (ii) the projection of a conjugate holomorphic function in L^{2}(\Omega) is automatically in H^{k_{2}}(\Omega). There are obvious corollaries for when B is globally regular.
