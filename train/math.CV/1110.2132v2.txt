We present a result on existence of some kind of peak functions for \C-convex domains and for the symmetrized polydisc. Then we apply the latter result to show the equivariance of the set of peak points for A(D) under proper holomorphic mappings. Additionally, we present a description of the set of peak points in the class of bounded pseudoconvex Reinhardt domains.
