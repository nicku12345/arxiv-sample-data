A sequence Z in the complex plane \C is called a zero sequence for the Fock space F^p_\alpha if there exists a function f\in F^p_\alpha, not identically zero, such that Z is the zero set of f, counting multiplicities. We show that there exist zero sequences Z for F^p_\alpha with the following properties: (1) For any a\in\C the sequence Z\cup\{a\} is no longer a zero sequence for F^p_\alpha; (2) the space I_Z consisting of all functions in F^p_\alpha that vanish on Z is one dimensional. These Z are naturally called maximal zero sequences for F^p_\alpha.
