Let X be an arbitrary complex surface and D \subset X a domain that has a non compact group of holomorphic automorphisms. A characterization of those domains D that admit a smooth real analytic, finite type boundary orbit accumulation point and whose closures are contained in a complete hyperbolic domain D'\subset X is obtained.
