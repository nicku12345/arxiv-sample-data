Let S be a surface obtained from a plane polygon by identifying infinitely many pairs of segments along its boundary. A condition is given under which the complex structure in the interior of the polygon extends uniquely across the quotient of its boundary to make S into a closed Riemann surface. When this condition holds, a modulus of continuity is obtained for a uniformizing map on S.
