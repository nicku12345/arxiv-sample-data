We generalize our previous results relating pluripotential energy with the electrostatic energy of a measure given by Berman, Boucksom, Guedj and Zeriahi. As a consequence, we obtain a large deviation principle for a canonical sequence of probability measures on a nonpluripolar compact set K in C^n. This is a special case of a result of R. Berman. For n=1, we include a proof that uses only standard techniques of weighted potential theory.
