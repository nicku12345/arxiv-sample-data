Recently the Gelfand-Tsetlin construction of orthogonal bases has been explicitly described for the spaces of k-homogeneous polynomial solutions of the Hodge-de Rham system in the Euclidean space R^m which take values in the space of s-vectors. In this paper, we give another construction of these bases and, mainly, we show that the bases even form complete orthogonal Appell systems. Moreover, we study the corresponding Taylor series expansions. As an application, we construct quite explicitly orthogonal bases for homogeneous solutions of an arbitrary generalized Moisil-Theodoresco system.
