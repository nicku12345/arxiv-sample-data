In this paper, we continue to discuss normality based on a single\linebreak holomorphic function. We obtain the following result. Let \CF be a family of functions holomorphic on a domain D\subset\mathbb C. Let k\ge2 be an integer and let h(\not\equiv0) be a holomorphic function on D, such that h(z) has no common zeros with any f\in\CF. Assume also that the following two conditions hold for every f\in\CF:\linebreak %{enumerate} [(a)] (a) f(z)=0\Longrightarrow f'(z)=h(z) and %[(b)] (b) f'(z)=h(z)\Longrightarrow|f^{(k)}(z)|\le c, where c is a constant. Then \CF is normal on D. %{enumerate}   A geometrical approach is used to arrive at the result which significantly improves the previous results of the authors, \textit{A criterion of normality based on a single holomorphic function}, Acta Math. Sinica, English Series (1) \textbf{27} (2011), 141--154 and of Chang, Fang, and Zalcman, \textit{Normal families of holomorphic functions}, Illinois Math. J. (1) \textbf{48} (2004), 319--337.   We also deal with two other similar criterions of normality. Our results are shown to be sharp.
