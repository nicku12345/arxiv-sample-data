In the present paper we answer a question raised by J. Borcea and P. Branden and give a description of the class of operators preserving roots in open circular domains, i.e., in images of the open upper half-plane under the Mobius transformations. Our second result is a description of the difference between \Apr(G) (the class of operators preserving roots in an open set G) and \Apr(\bar G) (the class of operators preserving roots in \bar{G}).
