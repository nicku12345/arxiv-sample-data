A plurisubharmonic singularity is extreme if it cannot be represented as the sum of non-homothetic singularities. A complete characterization of such singularities is given for the case of homogeneous singularities (in particular, those determined by generic holomorphic mappings) in terms of decomposability of certain convex sets in \Rn. Another class of extreme singularities is presented by means of a notion of relative type.
