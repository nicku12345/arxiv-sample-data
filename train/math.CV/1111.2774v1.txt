We give a Montessus de Ballore type theorem for row sequences of Hermite-Pad\'e approximations of vector valued analytic functions refining some results in this direction due to P.R. Graves-Morris and E.B. Saff. We do this introducing the notion of incomplete Pad\'e approximation which contains, in particular, simultaneous Pad\'e approximation and may be applied in the study of other systems of approximants as well.
