In an earlier article the second author introduced three families of tube domains in {\mathbf C}^2 with holomorphic automorphism group isomorphic to {\mathbf R}\ltimes{\mathbf R}^2 and envelope of holomorphy equal to {\mathbf C}^2. In the present paper we show that every domain in each of these families is Kobayashi-hyperbolic.
