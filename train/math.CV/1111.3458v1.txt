In one complex variable, the existence of a compactly supported solution to the Cauchy-Riemann equation is related to the vanishing of certain integrals of the data; trying to generalize this approach, we find an explicit construction, via convolution, for a compactly supported solution in \mathbb{C}^n, which allows to estimate the L^p norm of the solution. We also investigate the possible generalizations of this method to domains of the form P\setminus Z, where P is a polydisc and Z is the zero locus of some holomorphic function.
