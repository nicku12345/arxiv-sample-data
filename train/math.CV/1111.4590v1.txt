In this paper we examine the structure of complex points of real 4-manifolds embedded into complex 3-manifolds up to isotopy. We show that there are only two types of complex points up to isotopy and as a consequence, show that any such embedding can be deformed by isotopy to a manifold having 2-complete neighborhood basis.
