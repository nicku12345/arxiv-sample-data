Let H(\mathbb{B}) denote the space of all holomorphic functions on the unit ball \mathbb{B}\in \mathbb{C}^n. In this paper we investigate the boundedness and compactness of the products of radial derivative operator and the following integral-type operator  I_\phi^g f(z)=\int_0^1 \Re f(\phi(tz))g(tz)\frac{dt}{t},\ z\in\mathbb{B}  where g\in H(\mathbb{B}), g(0)=0, \phi is a holomorphic self-map of \mathbb{B},\ between Zygmund spaces and Bloch spaces.
