In this paper, we obtain a sharp distortion theorem for a class of functions in \alpha-Bloch spaces, and as an application of it, we establish the corresponding Landau's theorem. These results generalize the corresponding results of Bonk, Minda and Yanagihara, and Liu, respectively. We also prove the existence of Landau-Bloch constant for a class of functions in Hardy spaces and the obtained result is a generalization of the corresponding result of Chen and Gauthier.
