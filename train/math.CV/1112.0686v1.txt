Let {\mathcal S} be the class of all functions f that are analytic and univalent in the unit disk \ID with the normalization f(0)=f'(0)-1=0. Let \mathcal{U} (\lambda) denote the set of all f\in {\mathcal S} satisfying the condition |f'(z)(\frac{z}{f(z)})^{2}-1| <\lambda ~for z\in \ID,  for some \lambda \in (0,1]. In this paper, among other things, we study a "harmonic mean" of two univalent analytic functions. More precisely, we discuss the properties of the class of functions F of the form \frac{z}{F(z)}=1/2(\frac{z}{f(z)}+\frac{z}{g(z)}),  where f,g\in \mathcal{S} or f,g\in \mathcal{U}(1). In particular, we determine the radius of univalency of F, and propose two conjectures concerning the univalency of F.
