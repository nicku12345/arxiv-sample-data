We study both canonical reproducing kernels and constructive reproducing kernels for holomorphic functions in \CC^1 and \CC^n. We compare and contrast the two, and also develop important relations between the two types of kernels. We prove a new result about the relationship between these two kernels on certain domains of finite type.
