We prove some L^{\infty} a priori estimates as well as existence and stability theorems for the weak solutions of the complex Hessian equations in domains of C^n and on compact K\"ahler manifolds. We also show optimal L^p integrability for m-subharmonic functions with compact singularities, thus partially confirming a conjecture of Blocki. Finally we obtain a local regularity result for W^{2,p} solutions of the real and complex Hessian equations under suitable regularity assumptions on the right hand side. In the real case the method of this proof improves a result of Urbas.
