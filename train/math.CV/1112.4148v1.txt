Let X be a complex space and H a positive homogeneous plurisubharmonic function H on X\times\C^m. Consider the Hartogs-type domain \Omega_{H}(X):=\{(z,w)\in X\times \C^m:H(z,w)<1 \}. Let S be an analytic subset of X. We give necessary and sufficient conditions for hyperbolicity and tautness modulo S\times \C^m of \Omega_{H}(X), with the obvious corollaries for the special case of Hartogs domains.
