A Loewner variational method is developed that allows to calculate arbitrary continuous coefficient functionals of the second, third and fourth coefficients of schlicht functions. Based on this method an improved lower bound for the Milin-constant(0.034856..) is given, as well as an improved lower bound for the maximal modulus of the seventh coefficient of odd schlicht functions(1.006763..).
