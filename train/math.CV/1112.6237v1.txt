In this note, we mainly concern the set U_f of c\in\mathbb{C} such that the power deformation z(f(z)/z)^c is univalent in the unit disk |z|<1 for a given analytic univalent function f(z)=z+a_2z^2+\cdots in the unit disk. We will show that U_f is a compact, polynomially convex subset of the complex plane \C unless f is the identity function. In particular, the interior of U_f is simply connected. This fact enables us to apply various versions of the \lambda-lemma for the holomorphic family z(f(z)/z)^c of injections parametrized over the interior of U_f. We also give necessary or sufficient conditions for U_f to contain 0 or 1 as an interior point.
