In this article, we show that if \Pi: X\rightarrow Y is an unbranched Riemann domain over an r-complete complex space Y, then for any coherent analytic sheaf {\mathcal{F}} on X the cohomology group H^{p}(X,{\mathcal{F}}) vanishes for all p\geq q+r-1. In particular, one gets a positive answer to a generalization of the local Stein problem and new vanishing theorems for the cohomology of locally q-complete open sets in r-complete spaces.
