The classical theorem of Bloch (1924) asserts that if f is a holomorphic function on a region that contains the closed unit disk |z|\leq 1 such that f(0) = 0 and |f'(0)| = 1, then the image domain contains discs of radius 3/2-\sqrt{2} > 1/12. The optimal value is known as Bloch's constant and 1/12 is not the best possible. In this paper we give a direct generalization of Bloch's theorem to the three-dimensional Euclidean space in the framework of quaternion analysis. We compute explicitly a lower bound for the Bloch constant.
