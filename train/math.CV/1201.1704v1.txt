Let M be a CR submanifold of a complex manifold X. The main result of this article is to show that CR-hypoellipticity at p_0\in{M} is necessary and sufficient for holomorphic extension of all germs of CR functions to an ambient neighborhood in X. As an application, we obtain that CR-hypoellipticity implies the existence of generic embeddings and prove holomorphic extension for a large class of CR manifolds satisfying a higher order Levi pseudoconcavity condition.
