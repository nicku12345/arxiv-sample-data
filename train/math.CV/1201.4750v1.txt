The article is devoted to the geometry of solutions to the chordal Loewner equation which is based on comparison of singular solutions and harmonic measures for the sides of a slit in domains generated by a driving term. It is proved that harmonic measures of two sides of a slit in the upper half-plane which is perpendicular to the real axis are asymptotically equal to each other.
