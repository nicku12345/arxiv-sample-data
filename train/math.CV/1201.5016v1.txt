The following paper is a variation on a theme of Gianfranco Cimmino on some integral representation formulas for the solution of a linear equations system.   Cimmino was probably motivated for giving a representation formula suitable not only for theoretical investigations but also for applied computation.   In this paper we will prove that the Cimmino integrals are strictly related to the residues of some zeta-like functions associated to the linear system.
