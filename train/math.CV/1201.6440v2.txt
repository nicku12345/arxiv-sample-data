In this paper, we study the gap rigidity phenomenon for proper holomorphic maps between balls of different dimension. We show that any F\in prop_3({\mathbb{B}}^n, {\mathbb{B}} ^N), with 3n<N\leq 4n-7 and n\geq 7, is equivalent to a map of the form (G,0) with G\in Rat ({\mathbb{B}}^n,{\mathbb{B}}^{3n}). The main ingredients for the proof of our main theorem are the normal form obtained by Huang-Ji-Xu and a lemma of the first author.
