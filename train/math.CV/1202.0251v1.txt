A new explicit construction of Cauchy-Fantappi\'e kernels is introduced for an arbitrary weakly pseudoconvex domain with smooth boundary. While not holomorphic in the parameter, the new kernel reflects the complex geometry and the Levi form of the boundary. Some estimates are obtained for the corresponding integral operator, which provide evidence that this kernel and related constructions give useful new tools for complex analysis on this general class of domains.
