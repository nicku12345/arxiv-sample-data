The paper is concerned with mappings between planar domains having least Dirichlet energy. The existence and uniqueness (up to a conformal change of variables in the domain) of the energy-minimal mappings is established within the class \bar{\mathscr H}_2(X, Y) of strong limits of homeomorphisms in the Sobolev space W^{1,2}(X, Y), a result of considerable interest in the mathematical models of Nonlinear Elasticity. The inner variation leads to the Hopf differential h_z \bar{h_{\bar{z}}} dz \otimes dz and its trajectories. For a pair of doubly connected domains, in which X has finite conformal modulus, we establish the following principle:   A mapping h \in \bar{\mathscr H}_2(X, Y) is energy-minimal if and only if its Hopf-differential is analytic in X and real along the boundary of X.   In general, the energy-minimal mappings may not be injective, in which case one observes the occurrence of cracks in X. Nevertheless, cracks are triggered only by the points in the boundary of Y where Y fails to be convex. The general law of formation of cracks reads as follows:   Cracks propagate along vertical trajectories of the Hopf differential from the boundary of X toward the interior of X where they eventually terminate before making a crosscut.
