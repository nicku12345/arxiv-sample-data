In this paper, we first study the bounded mean oscillation of planar harmonic mappings, then a relationship between Lipschitz-type spaces and equivalent modulus of real harmonic mappings is established. At last, we obtain sharp estimates on Lipschitz number of planar harmonic mappings in terms of bounded mean oscillation norm, which shows that the harmonic Bloch space is isomorphic to BMO_{2} as a Banach space..
