Let n be a positive integer. Let \mathbf U be the unit disk, p\ge 1 and let h^p(\mathbf U) be the Hardy space of harmonic functions. Kresin and Maz'ya in a recent paper found the representation for the function H_{n,p}(z) in the inequality |f^{(n)} (z)|\leq H_{n,p}(z)|\Re(f-\mathcal P_l)|_{h^p(\mathbf U)}, \Re f\in h^p(\mathbf U), z\in \mathbf U, where \mathcal P_l is a polynomial of degree l\le n-1. We find or represent the sharp constant C_{p,n} in the inequality H_{n,p}(z)\le \frac{C_{p,n}}{(1-|z|^2)^{1/p+n}}. This extends a recent result of the second author and Markovi\'c, where it was considered the case n=1 only. As a corollary, an inequality for the modulus of the n-{th} derivative of an analytic function defined in a complex domain with the bounded real part is obtained. This result improves some recent result of Kresin and Maz'ya.
