Let S\subset \C^n, n\geq 3 be a compact connected 2-codimensional submanifold having the following property: there exists a Levi-flat hypersurface whose boundary is S, possibly as a current. Our goal is to get examples of such S containing at least one special 1-hyperbolic point: sphere with two horns; elementary models and their gluing. The particular cases of graphs are also described.
