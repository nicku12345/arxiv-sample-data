By a theorem of Andreotti and Grauert if \omega  is a (p,q) current, q < n, in a Stein manifold \displaystyle \Omega ,\ \bar \partial  closed and with compact support, then there is a solution u to \bar \partial u=\omega  still with compact support in \displaystyle \Omega . The main result of this work is to show that if moreover \displaystyle \omega \in L^{r}(m), where m is a suitable Lebesgue measure on the Stein manifold, then we have a solution u with compact support {\sl and} in L^{s}(m),\ \frac{1}{s}=\frac{1}{r}-\frac{1}{2(n+1)}. We prove it by estimates in L^{r} spaces with weights.
