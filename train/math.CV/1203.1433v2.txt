We prove a certain non-linear version of the Levi extension theorem for meromorphic functions. This means that the meromorphic function in question is supposed to be extendable along a sequence of complex curves, which are arbitrary, not necessarily straight lines. Moreover, these curves are not supposed to belong to any finite dimensional analytic family. The conclusion of our theorem is that nevertheless the function in question meromorphically extends along an (infinite dimensional) analytic family of complex curves and its domain of existence is a pinched domain filled in by this analytic family.
