In this paper, we investigate some properties of planar harmonic mappings. First, we generalize the main results in \cite{CPW3} and \cite{HT}, and then discuss the relationship between area integral means and harmonic Hardy spaces or harmonic weighted Bergman spaces. At the end, coefficient estimates of mappings in weighted Bergman spaces are obtained.
