Let \mathcal{A} denote the set of all analytic functions f in the unit disk \ID=\{z:\,|z|<1\} of the form f(z)=z+\sum_{n=2}^{\infty}a_nz^n. Let \mathcal{U} denote the set of all f\in \mathcal{A}, f(z)/z\neq 0 and satisfying the condition  | f'(z) (\frac{z}{f(z)})^{2}-1 | < 1 {for z\in \ID}.  Functions in {\mathcal U} are known to be univalent in \ID. For \alpha \in [0,1], let  \mathcal{N}(\alpha)= \{f_\alpha :\, f_\alpha (z)=(1-\alpha)f(z)+\alpha \int_0^z\frac{f(t)}{t}\,dt, {f\in\mathcal{A} with |a_n|\leq n for n\geq 2}\}.  In this paper, we first show that the condition \sum_{n=2}^{\infty}n|a_n|\leq 1 is sufficient for f to be in {\mathcal U} and the same condition is necessary for f\in {\mathcal U} in case all a_n's are negative. Next, we obtain the radius of univalence of functions in the class \mathcal{N}(\alpha). Also, for f,g\in \mathcal{U} with \frac{f(z)+g(z)}{z}\neq 0 in \ID, F(z)=(f(z)+g(z))/2, and G(z)=r^{-1}F(rz), we determine a range of r such that G\in {\mathcal U}. As a consequence of these results, several special cases are presented.
