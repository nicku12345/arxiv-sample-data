We study the analytic continuation problem for a germ of a biholomorphic mapping from a non-minimal real hypersurface M\subset\CC{n} into a real hyperquadric \mathcal Q\subset\CP{n} and prove that under certain non-degeneracy conditions any such germ extends locally biholomorphically along any path lying in the complement U\setminus X of the complex hypersurface X contained in M for an appropriate neighborhood U\supset X. Using the monodromy representation for the multiple-valued mapping obtained by the analytic continuation we establish a connection between nonminimal real hypersurfaces and singular complex ODEs.
