We prove a Liouville type theorem for entire maximal m-subharmonic functions in \mathbb C^n with bounded gradient. This result, coupled with a standard blow-up argument, yields a (non-explicit) a priori gradient estimate for the complex Hessian equation on a compact K\"ahler manifold. This terminates the program, initiated by Hou, Ma and Wu, of solving the non-degenerate Hessian equation on such manifolds in full generality. We also obtain, using our previous work, continuous weak solutions in the degenerate case for the right hand side in some L^p,  with sharp bound on p.
