Any bounded analytic function g induces a bounded integral operator S_g on the Bloch space, the Dirichlet space and BMOA respectively. S_g attains its norm on the Bloch space and BMOA for any g, but does not attain its norm on the Dirichlet space for non-constant g. Some results are also obtained for S_g on the little Bloch space, and for another integral operator T_g from the Dirichlet space to the Bergman space.
