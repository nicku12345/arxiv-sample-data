This paper deals with the the norm of the weighted Bergman projection operator P_\alpha:L^\infty\to \mathcal{B} where \alpha>-1 and \mathcal{B} is the Bloch space of the unit ball of the complex space \mathbf{C}^n. We consider two Bloch norms, the standard Bloch norm and invariant norm w.r.t. automorphisms of the unit ball. Our work contains as a special case the main result of the recent paper \cite{Perala}.
