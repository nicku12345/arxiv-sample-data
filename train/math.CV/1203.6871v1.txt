The optimal target dimensions are determined for totally real immersions and for independent mappings into complex affine spaces. Our arguments are similar to those given by Forster, but we use orientable manifolds as far as possible and so are able to obtain improved results for orientable manifolds of even dimension. This leads to new examples showing that the known immersion and submersion dimensions for holomorphic mappings from Stein manifolds to affine spaces are best possible.
