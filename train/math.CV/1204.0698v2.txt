In this paper our aim is to present some subordination and superordination results, by using an operator, which involves the normalized form of the generalized Bessel functions of first kind. These results are obtained by investigating some appropriate classes of admissible functions. We obtain also some sandwich-type results and we point out various known or new special cases of our main results.
