A 2p-times continuously differentiable complex-valued function f=u+iv in a simply connected domain \Omega\subseteq\mathbb{C} is \textit{p-harmonic} if f satisfies the p-harmonic equation \Delta ^pf=0. In this paper, we investigate the properties of p-harmonic mappings in the unit disk |z|<1. First, we discuss the convexity, the starlikeness and the region of variability of some classes of p-harmonic mappings. Then we prove the existence of Landau constant for the class of functions of the form Df=zf_{z}-\barzf_{\barz}, where f is p-harmonic in |z|<1. Also, we discuss the region of variability for certain p-harmonic mappings. At the end, as a consequence of the earlier results of the authors, we present explicit upper estimates for Bloch norm for bi- and tri-harmonic mappings.
