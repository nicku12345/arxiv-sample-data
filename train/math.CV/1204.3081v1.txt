We consider an integral operator \mathcal{I}, special instances of which was studied in various contexts. Using an appropriate transformation we write this operator in terms of weighted composition operators. Then, we provide a boundedness criterion on weighted Dirichlet spaces, and we apply this result in order to prove that certain integral operators are bounded on that spaces, unifying this way and extending previous results.
