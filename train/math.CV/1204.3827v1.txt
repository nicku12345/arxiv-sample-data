The main result of this paper is some "annulus" formula for the relative extremal function in the context of Stein spaces (Theorem 1.1). Our result may be useful in the theory of the extension of separately holomorphic functions on generalized (N,k)-crosses lying in the product of Stein manifolds (Theorem 4.6).
