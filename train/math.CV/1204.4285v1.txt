In the present investigation, we consider two new subclasses N_{{\Sigma}}^{{\mu}}({\alpha},{\lambda}) and N_{{\Sigma}}^{{\mu}}({\beta},{\lambda}) of bi-univalent functions defined in the open unit disk U={z:|z|<1}. Besides, we find upper bounds for the second and third coefficients for functions in these new subclasses.
