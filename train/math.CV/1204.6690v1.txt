In this paper, we discuss some properties on hyperbolic-harmonic mappings in the unit ball of \mathbb{C}^{n}. First, we investigate the relationship between the weighted Lipschitz functions and the hyperbolic-harmonic Bloch spaces. Then we establish the Schwarz-Pick type theorem for hyperbolic-harmonic mappings and apply it to prove the existence of Landau-Bloch constant for mappings in \alpha-Bloch spaces.
