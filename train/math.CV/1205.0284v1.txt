We show that biholomorphic mappings between two bounded, pseudoconvex domains with smooth boundary extend smoothly to the boundaries of the domains, under a regularity condition on a family of twisted Bergman-like projections. This result is inspired by and generalizes a sufficient condition for extension due to Bell and Ligocka.
