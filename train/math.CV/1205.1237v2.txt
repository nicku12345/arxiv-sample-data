We show that there are strictly pseudoconvex, real algebraic hypersurfaces in \bC^{n+1} that cannot be locally embedded into a sphere in \bC^{N+1} for any N. In fact, we show that there are strictly pseudoconvex, real algebraic hypersurfaces in \bC^{n+1} that cannot be locally embedded into any compact, strictly pseudoconvex, real algebraic hypersurface.
