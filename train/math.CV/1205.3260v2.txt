The classical embedding theorem of Carleson deals with finite positive Borel measures \mu on the closed unit disk for which there exists a positive constant c such that |f|_{L^2(\mu)} \leq c |f|_{H^2} for all f \in H^2, the Hardy space of the unit disk. Lef\'evre et al. examined measures \mu for which there exists a positive constant c such that \|f\|_{L^2(\mu)} \geq c |f|_{H^2} for all f \in H^2. The first type of inequality above was explored with H^2 replaced by one of the model spaces (\Theta H^2)^{\perp} by Aleksandrov, Baranov, Cohn, Treil, and Volberg. In this paper we discuss the second type of inequality in (\Theta H^2)^{\perp}.
