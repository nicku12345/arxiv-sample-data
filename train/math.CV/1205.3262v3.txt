We study the real analyticity of a CR mapping on the hypersurface \h defined by \h=\{z\in\C^n,\Re(z_n)+|z'|^2=0\} in model almost complex manifolds. We make use of a method of prolongation for the tangential Cauchy-Riemann equations and a result about complete systems. We also prove that a CR mapping is real analytic when the almost complex structure of the codomain is a deformation of a model structure and the function defining the hypersurface in the codomain has a particular form.
