We give a survey of results on zero distribution and factorization of analytic functions in the unit disc in classes defined by the growth of \log|f(re^{i\theta})| in the uniform and integral metrics. We restrict ourself by the case of finite order of growth. For a Blaschke product B we obtain a necessary and sufficient condition for the uniform boundedness of all p-means of \log|B(re^{i\theta})|, where p>1.
