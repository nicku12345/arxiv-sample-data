In this paper we study some new special functions that arise naturally within the framework of Hermitian Clifford analysis, which concerns the study of Dirac-like systems in several complex variables. In particular we focus on Hermite polynomials, Bessel functions and generalized powers. We also derive a Vekua system for solutions of Hermitian systems in axially symmetric domains.
