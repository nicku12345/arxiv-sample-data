In this paper, we study the supports of measures in the free additive convolution semigroup \{\mu^{\boxplus t}:t>1\}, where \mu is a Borel probability measure on \mathbb{R}. We give a formula for the density of the absolutely continuous part of \mu^{\boxplus t} and use this formula to obtain certain regularizing properties of \mu^{\boxplus t}. We show that the number n(t) of the components in the support of \mu^{\boxplus t} is a decreasing function of t and give equivalent conditions so that n(t)=1 for sufficiently large t. Moreover, a measure \mu so that \mu^{\boxplus t} has infinitely many components in the support for all t>1 is given.
