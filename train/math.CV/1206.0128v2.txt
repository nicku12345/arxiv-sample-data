Suppose that E denotes a real Banach space with the dimension at least 2. The main aim of this paper is to show that a domain D in E is a \psi-uniform domain if and only if D\backslash P is a \psi_1-uniform domain, and D is a uniform domain if and only if D\backslash P also is a uniform domain, whenever P is a closed countable subset of D satisfying a quasihyperbolic separation condition. This condition requires that the quasihyperbolic distance (w.r.t. D) between each pair of distinct points in P has a lower bound greater than or equal to \frac{1}{2}.
