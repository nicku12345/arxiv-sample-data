For any minimal compact complex surface S with n=b_2(S)>0 containing global spherical shells (GSS) we study the effectiveness of the 2n parameters given by the n blown up points. There exists a family of surfaces with GSS which contains as fibers S, some Inoue-Hirzebruch surface and non minimal surfaces, such that blown up points are generically effective parameters. These families are versal outside a non empty hypersurface T. We deduce that, for any configuration of rational curves, there is a non empty open set in the Oeljeklaus-Toma moduli space such that the corresponding surfaces are defined by a contracting germ in Cremona group, in particular admit a birational structure.
