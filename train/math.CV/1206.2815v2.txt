The Dirichlet--Hardy space \Ht consists of those Dirichlet series \sum_n a_n n^{-s} for which \sum_n |a_n|^2<\infty. It is shown that the Blaschke condition in the half-plane \operatorname{Re} s>1/2 is a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a nontrivial function f in \Ht vanishing on a given bounded sequence. The proof implies in fact a stronger result: every function in the Hardy space H^2 of the half-plane \operatorname{Re} s>1/2 can be interpolated by a function in \Ht on such a Blaschke sequence. Analogous results are proved for the Hilbert space \Da of Dirichlet series \sum_n a_n n^{-s} for which \sum_n |a_n|^2[d(n)]^\alpha <\infty; here d(n) is the divisor function and \alpha a positive parameter. In this case, the zero sets are related locally to the zeros of functions in weighted Dirichlet spaces of the half-plane \operatorname{Re} s>1/2. Partial results are then obtained for the zeros of functions in \Hp (L^p analogues of \Ht) for 2<p<\infty, based on certain contractive embeddings of \Da in \Hp.
