We extend some results on piecewise linear functions on \C^n to piecewise pluriharmonic functions on any complex manifold.   We construct a ring generated by currents h and dd^ch, where \{h\} is a finite set of piecewise pluriharmonic functions.   We prove that, with some restrictions on the set \{h\}, the map \{h\mapsto dd^ch,\ dd^ch\mapsto0\} can be continued to the derivation on the ring.   As a corollary, the current dd^cg_1\wedge...\wedge dd^cg_k depends on the product of piecewise pluriharmonic functions g_1,...,g_k only.
