Let {\mathcal S^0}(H_{\gamma}) denote the class of all univalent, harmonic, sense-preserving and normalized mappings f of the unit disk \ID onto the slanted half-plane H_\gamma :=\{w:\,{\rm Re\,}(e^{i\gamma}w) >-1/2\} with an additional condition f_{\bar{z}}(0)=0. Functions in this class can be constructed by the shear construction due to Clunie and Sheil-Small which allows by examining their conformal counterpart. Unlike the conformal case, convolution of two univalent harmonic convex mappings in \ID is not necessarily even univalent in \ID. In this paper, we fix f_0\in{\mathcal S^0}(H_{0}) and show that the convolutions of f_0 and some slanted half-plane harmonic mapping are still convex in a particular direction. The results of the paper enhance the interest among harmonic mappings and, in particular, solves an open problem of Dorff, et. al. \cite{DN} in a more general setting. Finally, we present some basic examples of functions and their corresponding convolution functions with specified dilatations, and illustrate them graphically with the help of MATHEMATICA software. These examples explain the behaviour of the image domains.
