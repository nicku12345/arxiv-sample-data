In this article, we study a class of manifolds introduced by Bosio called \LVMB manifolds. We provide an interpretation of his construction in terms of quotient of toric manifolds by complex Lie groups. Furthermore, \LVMB manifolds extend a class of manifolds obtained by Meersseman, called \LVM manifolds, and we give a characterization of these manifolds using our toric description. Finally, we give an answer to a question asked by Cupit-Foutou and Zaffran.
