Let D be a smoothly bounded pseudoconvex domain in \mathbf C^n, n > 1. Using the Robin function \La(p) that arises from the Green function G(z, p) for D with pole at p \in D associated with the standard sum-of-squares Laplacian, N. Levenberg and H. Yamaguchi had constructed a K\"{a}hler metric (the so-called \La-metric) on D. Assume that D is strongly pseudoconvex and ds^2 denotes the \La-metric on D. In this article, first we prove that the holomorphic sectional curvature of ds^2 along normal directions converges to a negative constant near the boundary of D. Then, we prove that if D is not simply connected, then any nontrivial homotopy class of \pi_1(D) contains a closed geodesic for ds^2. Finally, we prove that the diminesion of the space of square integrable harmonic (p, q)-forms on D relative to ds^2 is zero except when p+q=n in which case it is infinite.
