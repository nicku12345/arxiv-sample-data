Various theorems on convergence of general space homeomorphisms are proved and, on this basis, theorems on convergence and compactness for classes of the so-called ring Q--homeomorphisms are obtained. In particular, it was established by us that a family of all ring Q--homeomorphisms f in {\Bbb R}^n fixing two points is compact provided that the function Q is of finite mean oscillation. These results will have wide applications to Sobolev's mappings.
