Given two ideals \mathcal{I} and \mathcal{J} of holomorphic functions such that \mathcal{I} \subseteq \mathcal{J}, we describe a comparison formula relating the Andersson-Wulcan currents of \mathcal{I} and \mathcal{J}. More generally, this comparison formula holds for residue currents associated to two generically exact Hermitian complexes together with a morphism between the complexes.   One application of the comparison formula is a generalization of the transformation law for Coleff-Herrera products to Andersson-Wulcan currents of Cohen-Macaulay ideals. We also use it to give an analytic proof by means of residue currents of theorems of Hickel, Vasconcelos and Wiebe related to the Jacobian ideal of a holomorphic mapping.
