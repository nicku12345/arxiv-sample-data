In this paper we prove that if I  is a subset of measure 0 in a C^2-smooth generic submanifold M of  \C^n, then its complement in M is non-plurithin at each point of M in \C^n. This result improves a previous result of A. Edigarian and J. Wiegerinck, who considered the case where I is pluripolar set contained in a C^1-smooth generic submanifold M \subset \C^n. The proof of our result is essentially different.
