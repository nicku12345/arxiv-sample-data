Suppose that f: D\to D' is a quasiconformal mapping, where D and D' are domains in {\mathbb R}^n, and that D is a broad domain. Then for every arcwise connected subset A in D, the weak quasisymmetry of the restriction f|_A: A\to f(A) implies its quasisymmetry, and as a consequence, we see that the answer to one of the open problems raised by Heinonen from 1989 is affirmative under the additional condition that A is arcwise connected. As an application, we establish nine equivalent conditions for a bounded domain, which is quasiconformally equivalent to a bounded and simply connected uniform domain, to be John. This result is a generalization of the main result of Heinonen from [Quasiconformal mappings onto John domains, \textit{Rev. Math. Iber.,} {\bf 5} (1989), 97--123].
