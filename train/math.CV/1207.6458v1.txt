An analytic function f defined on the open unit disk \mathbb{D}=\{z:|z|<1\} is bi-univalent if the function f and its inverse f^{-1} are univalent in \mathbb{D}. Estimates for the initial coefficients of bi-univalent functions f are investigated when f and f^{-1} respectively belong to some subclasses of univalent functions. Some earlier results are shown to be special cases of our results.
