Functions with fixed initial coefficient have been widely studied. A new methodology is proposed in this paper by making appropriate modifications and improvements to the theory of second-order differential subordination. Several interesting examples are given. The results obtained are applied to the classes of convex and starlike functions with fixed second coefficient.
