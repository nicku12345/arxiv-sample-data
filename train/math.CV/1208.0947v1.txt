It follows from the 2004 work of the first author, X.Huang, and D. Zaitsev that any local CR embedding f of a strictly psedoconvex hypersurface M^{2n+1}\subset\bC^{n+1} into the sphere \bS^{2N+1}\subset \bC^{N+1} is rigid, i.e.\ any other such local embedding is obtained from f by composition by an automorphism of the target sphere \bS^{2N+1}, {\it provided} that the codimension N-n<n/2. In this paper, we consider the limit case N-n=n/2 in the simplest situation where n=2, i.e.\ we consider local CR embeddings f\colon M^5\to \bS^7. We show that there are at most two different local embeddings, up to composition with an automorphism of \bS^7. We also identify a subclass of 5-dimensional, strictly pseudoconvex hypersurfaces M^5 in terms of their CR curvatures such that rigidity holds for local CR embeddings f\colon M^5\to \bS^7.
