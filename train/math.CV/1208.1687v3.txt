First of all, we establish compactness of continuous mappings of the Orlicz--Sobolev classes W^{1,\varphi}_{\rm loc} with the Calderon type condition on \varphi and, in particular, of the Sobolev classes W^{1,p}_{\rm loc} for p>n-1 in {\Bbb R}^n\,, n\ge 3\,, with one fixed point. Then we give a series of theorems on convergence of the Orlicz--Sobolev homeomorphisms and on semicontinuity in the mean of dilatations of the Sobolev homeomorphisms. These results lead us to closeness of the corresponding classes of homeomorpisms. Finally, we come on this basis to criteria of compactness of classes of Sobolev's homeomorphisms with the corresponding conditions on dilatations and two fixed points.
