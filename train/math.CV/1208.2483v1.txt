B. Friedman found in his 1946 paper that the set of analytic univalent functions on the unit disk in the complex plane with integral Taylor coefficients consists of nine functions. In the present paper, we prove that the similar set obtained by replacing "integral" by "half-integral" consists of another twelve functions in addition to the nine. We also observe geometric properties of the twelve functions.
