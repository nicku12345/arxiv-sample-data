In \C_z\times\R_t we consider the function g=g(z), set g_1=\di_z g, g_{1\bar 1}=\di_z\dib_zg and define the operator L_g=\di_z+ig_1\di_t. We discuss estimates with loss of derivatives, in the sense of Kohn, for the system (\bar L_g,f^kL_g) where (\bar L_g,L_g) is \frac1{2m}  subelliptic at 0 and f(0)=0,\,\,df(0)\neq0. We prove estimates with a loss l=\frac{k-1}{2m}  if the "multiplier" condition |f|\simgeq |g_{1\bar 1}|^{\frac1{2(m-1)}} is fulfilled. (For estimates without cut-off, subellipticity can be weakened to compactness and this results in a loss of l=\frac [{2(m-1)}.) For the choice (g,f^k)=(|z|^{2m},\bar z^k) this result was obtained by Kohn and Bove-Derridj-Kohn-Tartakoff for m=1 and m\geq1 respectively. Also, the loss l=\frac{k-1}{2m} was proven to be optimal. We show that it remains optimal for the model (g,f^k)=(x^{2m},x^k). Instead, for the model (g,f^k)=(|z|^{2m},x^k), in which the multiplier condition is violated, the loss is not lowered by the type and must be \geq \frac{k-1}2.
