Complex-valued harmonic functions that are univalent and sense-preserving in the open unit disk are widely studied. A new methodology is employed to construct subclasses of univalent harmonic mappings from a given subfamily of univalent analytic functions. The notion of harmonic Alexander integral operator is introduced. Also, the radius of convexity for certain families of harmonic functions is determined.
