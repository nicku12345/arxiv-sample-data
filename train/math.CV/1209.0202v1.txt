In this paper, we study the family {\mathcal C}_{H}^0 of sense-preserving complex-valued harmonic functions f that are normalized close-to-convex functions on the open unit disk \mathbb{D} with f_{\bar{z}}(0)=0. We derive a sufficient condition for f to belong to the class \CC_{H}^0. We take the analytic part of f to be zF(a,b;c;z) or zF(a,b;c;z^2) and for a suitable choice of co-analytic part of f, the second complex dilatation w(z)=\bar{f_{\bar{z}}}/f_z turns out to be a square of an analytic function. Hence f is lifted to a minimal surface expressed by an isothermal parameter. Explicit representation for classes of minimal surfaces are given. Graphs generated by using Mathematica are used for illustration.
