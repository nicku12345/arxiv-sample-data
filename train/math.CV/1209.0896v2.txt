The theory of first-order differential subordination developed by Miller and Mocanu was recently extended to functions with fixed initial coefficient by R. M. Ali, S. Nagpal and V. Ravichandran [Second-order differential subordination for analytic functions with fixed initial coefficient, Bull. Malays. Math. Sci. Soc. (2) 34 (2011), 611--629] and applied to obtain several generalization of classical results in geometric function theory. In this paper, further applications of this subordination theory is given. In particular, several sufficient conditions related to starlikeness, convexity, close-to-convexity of normalized analytic functions are derived. Connections with previously known results are pointed out.
