We develop a least-squares method for computing the analytic capacity of compact plane sets with piecewise-analytic boundary. The method furnishes rigorous upper and lower bounds which converge to the true value of the capacity. Several illustrative examples are presented. We are led to formulate a conjecture which, if true, would imply that analytic capacity is subadditive. The conjecture is proved in a special case.
