The paper is devoted to the study of mappings with non--bounded characteristics of quasiconformality. The analog of the theorem about radius injectivity of locally quasiconformal mappings was proved for some class of mappings. There are found sharp conditions under which the so called local Q--homeomorphisms are injective in some neighborhood of a fixed point.
