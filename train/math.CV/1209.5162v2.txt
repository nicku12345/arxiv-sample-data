In this paper, we investigate the properties of locally univalent and multivalent planar harmonic mappings. First, we discuss the coefficient estimates and Landau's Theorem for some classes of locally univalent harmonic mappings, and then we study some Lipschitz-type spaces for locally univalent and multivalent harmonic mappings.
