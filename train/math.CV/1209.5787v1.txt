Let \mathcal{M} be the set of Borel probability measures on \mathbb{R}. We denote by \mu^{\mathrm{ac}} the absolutely continuous part of \mu\in\mathcal{M}. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the supports and regularity for measures of the form (\mu^{\boxplus p})^{\uplus q}, \mu\in\mathcal{M}, where \boxplus and \uplus are the operations of free additive and Boolean convolution on \mathcal{M}, respectively, and p\geq1, q>0. We show that for any q the supports of ((\mu^{\boxplus p})^{\uplus q})^{\mathrm{ac}} and (\mu^{\boxplus p})^{\mathrm{ac}} contain the same number of components and this number is a decreasing function of p. Explicit formulas for the densities of ((\mu^{\boxplus p})^{\uplus q})^{\mathrm{ac}} and criteria for determining the atoms of (\mu^{\boxplus p})^{\uplus q} are given. Based on the subordination functions of free convolution powers, we give another point of view to analyze the set of \boxplus-infinitely divisible measures and provide explicit expressions for their Voiculescu transforms in terms of free and Boolean convolutions.
