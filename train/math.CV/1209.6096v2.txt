Conformal Riemann mapping of the unit disk onto a simply-connected domain W is a central object of study in classical Complex Analysis. The first complete proof of the Riemann Mapping Theorem given by P. Koebe in 1912 is constructive, and theoretical aspects of computing the Riemann map have been extensively studied since. Carath{\'e}odory Theory describes the boundary extension of the Riemann map. In this paper we develop its constructive version with explicit complexity bounds.
