Let (W,\Pi) be a Riemann domain over a complex manifold M and w_0 be a point in W. Let \mathbb D be the unit disk in \mathbb C and \mathbb T=\bd\mathbb D. Consider the space {\mathcal S}_{1,w_0}({\bar{\mathbb D}},W,M) of continuous mappings f of \mathbb T into W such that f(1)=w_0 and \Pi\circ f extends to a holomorphic on \mathbb D mapping \hat f. Mappings f_0,f_1\in{\mathcal S}_{1,w_0}({\bar{\mathbb D}},W,M) are called {\it h-homotopic} if there is a continuous mapping f_t of [0,1] into \rS_{1,w_0}({\bar{\mathbb D}},W,M). Clearly, the h-homotopy is an equivalence relation and the equivalence class of f\in{\mathcal S}_{1,w_0}({\bar{\mathbb D}},W,M) will be denoted by [f] and the set of all equivalence classes by \eta_1(W,M,w_0). There is a natural mapping \iota_1:\,\eta_1(W,M,w_0)\to\pi_1(W,w_0) generated by assigning to f\in{\mathcal S}_{1,w_0}({\bar{\mathbb D}},W,M) its restriction to \mathbb T. We introduce on \eta_1(W,M,w_0) a binary operation \star which induces on \eta_1(W,M,w_0) a structure of a semigroup with unity. Moreover, \iota_1([f_1]\star[f_2])=\iota_1([f_1])\cdot\iota_1([f_2]), where \cdot is the standard operation on \pi_1(W,w_0). Then we establish standard properties of \eta_1(W,M,w_0) and provide some examples. In particular, we completely describe \eta_1(W,M,w_0) when W is a finitely connected domain in M=\mathbb C and \Pi is an identity. In particular, we show for a general domain W\subset\mahbb C that [f_1]=[f_2] if and only if \iota_1([f_1])=\iota_1([f_2]).
