Kuranishi's fundamental result (1962) associates to any compact complex manifold X_0 a finite-dimensional analytic space which has to be thought of as a local moduli space of complex structures close to X_0. In this paper, we give an analogous statement for Levi-flat CR manifolds fibering properly over the circle by associating to any such \mathcal X_0 the loop space of a finite-dimensional analytic space which serves as a local moduli space of CR structures close to \mathcal X_0. We then develop in this context a Kodaira-Spencer deformation theory making clear the likenesses as well as the differences with the classical case. The article ends with applications and examples.
