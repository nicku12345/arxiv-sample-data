It is known that if a sequence of domains U_n converges to a domain U in the Caratheodory sense then the hyperbolic densities on U_n converge to the hyperbolic density on U. In this paper, we study the rate of convergence of the hyperbolic density under a slightly different mode of convergence. In doing so, we are led to consider two other densities on domains, the Teichmueller density and the three-point density. We obtain several results which give rates of convergence in various scenarios.
