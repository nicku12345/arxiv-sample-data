We give some coefficient bounds and distortion theorems for a subclass of univalent functions in the unit disk, and defined using the S\^{a}l\^{a}gean differential operator. The results generalize and unify some well known results for several subclasses of univalent functions defined on the unit disk having form f(z)=z+\sum_{n=2}^{\infty}a_nz^n, normalized such that f(0)=0 and f^\prime(0)=1.
