In this paper we introduce a definition of the pre-Schwarzian and the Schwarzian derivatives of any locally univalent harmonic mapping f in the complex plane without assuming any additional condition on the (second complex) dilatation \omega_f of f. Using the new definition for the Schwarzian derivative of harmonic mappings, we prove analogous theorems to those by Chuaqui, Duren, and Osgood. Also, we obtain a Becker-type criterion for the univalence of harmonic mappings.
