Let {\mathfrak C}_{2,1} be the class of connected 5-dimensional CR-hypersurfaces that are 2-nondegenerate and uniformly Levi degenerate of rank 1. We show that the CR-structures in {\mathfrak C}_{2,1} are reducible to {\mathfrak{so}}(3,2)-valued absolute parallelisms and give applications of this result.
