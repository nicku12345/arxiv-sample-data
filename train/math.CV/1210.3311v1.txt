This monograph is devoted to the study of the weighted Bergman space A^p_\om of the unit disc \D that is induced by a radial continuous weight \om satisfying   {equation}\label{absteq}   \lim_{r\to   1^-}\frac{\int_r^1\om(s)\,ds}{\om(r)(1-r)}=\infty.\tag{\dag}   {equation} Every such A^p_\om lies between the Hardy space H^p and every classical weighted Bergman space A^p_\a. Even if it is well known that H^p is the limit of A^p_\a, as \a\to-1, in many respects, it is shown that A^p_\om lies "closer" to H^p than any A^p_\a, and that several finer function-theoretic properties of A^p_\a do not carry over to A^p_\om.   As to concrete objects to be studied, positive Borel measures \mu on \D such that A^p_\om\subset L^q(\mu), 0<p\le q<\infty , are characterized in terms of a neat geometric condition involving Carleson squares. It is also proved that each f\in A^p_\om can be represented in the form f=f_1\cdot f_2, where f_1\in A^{p_1}_\om, f_2\in A^{p_2}_\om and \frac{1}{p_1}+ \frac{1}{p_2}=\frac{1}{p}. Because of the tricky nature of A^p_\om several new concepts are introduced. It gives raise to a some what new approach to the study of the integral operator      T_g(f)(z)=\int_{0}^{z}f(\zeta)\,g'(\zeta)\,d\zeta.    This study reveals the fact that T_g:A^p_\om\to A^p_\om is bounded if and only if g belongs to a certain space of analytic functions that is not conformally invariant. The symbols g for which T_g belongs to the Schatten p-class \SSS_p(A^2_\om) are also described. Furthermore, techniques developed are applied to the study of the growth and the oscillation of analytic solutions of (linear) differential equations.
