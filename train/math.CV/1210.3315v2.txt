The main purpose of this paper is to study the generalized Hilbert operator   {equation*}   \mathcal{H}_g(f)(z)=\int_0^1f(t)g'(tz)\,dt   {equation*} acting on the weighted Bergman space A^p_\om, where the weight function \om belongs to the class \R of regular radial weights and satisfies the Muckenhoupt type condition   {equation}\label{Mpconditionaabstract}   \sup_{0\le r<1}\bigg(\int_{r}^1(\int_t^1\om(s)ds)^{-\frac{p'}{p}}\,dt\bigg)^\frac{p}{p'}   \int_{0}^r(1-t)^{-p}(\int_t^1\om(s)ds)\,dt<\infty. \tag{\dag}   {equation} If q=p, the condition on g that characterizes the boundedness (or the compactness) of \hg: A^p_\om\to A^q_\om depends on p only, but the situation is completely different in the case q\ne p in which the inducing weight \om plays a crucial role. The results obtained also reveal a natural connection to the Muckenhoupt type condition \eqref{Mpconditionaabstract}. Indeed, it is shown that the classical Hilbert operator (the case g(z)=\log\frac{1}{1-z} of \H_g) is bounded from L^p_{\int_{t}^1\om(s)\,ds}([0,1)) (the natural restriction of A^p_\om to functions defined on [0,1)) to A^p_\om if and only if \om satisfies the condition \eqref{Mpconditionaabstract}. On the way to these results decomposition norms for the weighted Bergman space A^p_\om are established.
