It is shown that for any non-decreasing, continuous and unbounded doubling function \om on [0,1), there exist two analytic infinite products f_0 and f_1 such that the asymptotic relation |f_0(z)| + |f_1(z)| \asymp \om(|z|) is satisfied for all z in the unit disc. It is also shown that both functions f_j for j=0,1 satisfy T(r,f_j)\asymp\log\omega(r), as r\to1^-, and hence give examples of analytic functions for which the Nevanlinna characteristic admits the regular slow growth induced by \omega.
