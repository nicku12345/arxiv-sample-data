We characterize the bounded, compact, and Schatten class product of Volterra type integral and composition operators acting between weighted Fock spaces. Our results are expressed in terms of certain Berezin type integral transforms on the complex plane \CC. We also estimate the norms and essential norms of these operators in terms of the integral transforms. All our results are valid for weighted composition operators when acting between the class of weighted Fock spaces considered.
