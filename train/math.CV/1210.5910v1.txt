We show that every homeomorphic W^{1,1}_{\rm loc} solution f to a Beltrami equation \bar{\partial}f=\mu \partial f in a domain D\subset\Bbb C is the so--called lower Q-homeomorphism with Q(z)=K^T_{\mu}(z, z_0) where K^T_{\mu}(z, z_0) is the tangent dilatation of f with respect to an arbitrary point z_0\in {\bar{D}} and develop the theory of the boundary behavior of such solutions. Then, on this basis, we show that, for wide classes of degenerate Beltrami equations \bar{\partial}f=\mu \partial f, there exist regular solutions of the Dirichlet problem in arbitrary Jordan domains in \Bbb C and pseudoregular and multi-valued solutions in arbitrary finitely connected domains in \Bbb C bounded by mutually disjoint Jordan curves.
