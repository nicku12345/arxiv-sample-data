We prove that every smooth CR manifold M\subset\subset \C^n, of hypersurface type, has a complex strip-manifold extension in \C^n. If M is, in addition, pseudoconvex-oriented, it is the "exterior" boundary of the strip. In turn, the strip extends to a variety with boundary M (Rothstein-Sperling Theorem); in case M is contained in a pseudoconvex boundary with no complex tangencies, the variety is embedded in \C^n. Altogether we get: M is the boundary of a variety (Harvey-Lawson Theorem); if M is pseudoconvex oriented the singularities of the variety are isolated in the interior; if M lies in a pseudoconvex boundary, the variety is embedded in \C^n (and is still smooth at M)
