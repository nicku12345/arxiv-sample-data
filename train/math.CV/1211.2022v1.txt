Suppose that E and E' denote real Banach spaces with dimension at least 2, that D\not=E and D'\not=E' are bounded domains with connected boundaries, that f: D\to D' is an M-QH homeomorphism, and that D' is uniform.   The main aim of this paper is to prove that f extends to a homeomorphism \bar \bar{D}\to \bar{D}' and \bar{f}|\partial D is bilipschitz if and only if f is bilipschitz in \bar{D}. The answer to some open problem of V\"ais\"al\"a is affirmative under an natural additional condition.
