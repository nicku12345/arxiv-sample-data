The Poincar\'e-Alexander Theorem states that holomorphic mappings defined on an open subset of the unit ball of C^n may, under certain conditions, be extended to a biholomorphism of the unit ball. In a complex manifold, every strongly pseudoconvex homogeneous domain is biholomorphic to the unit ball. In an almost complex manifold, the unit ball is not the only strongly pseudoconvex homogeneous domain. A strongly pseudoconvex homogeneous domain is biholomorphic to a model domain. The aim of this paper is to extend this theorem to model domains.
