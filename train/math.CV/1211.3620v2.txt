We give in \mathbb{R}^6 a real analytic almost complex structure J, a real analytic hypersurface M and a vector v in the Levi null set at 0 of M, such that there is no germ of J-holomorphic disc f included in M with f(0)=0 and \frac{\partial f}{\partial x}(0)=v, although the Levi form of M has constant rank. Then for any hypersurface M and any complex structure J, we give necessary conditions under which there exists such a germ of disc.
