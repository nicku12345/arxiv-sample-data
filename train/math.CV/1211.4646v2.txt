We treat the boundary problem for complex varieties with isolated singularities, of complex dimension greater than or equal to 3, non necessarily compact, which are contained in strongly convex, open subsets of a complex Hilbert space H. We deal with the problem by cutting with a family of complex hyperplanes in the fashion of [2] and applying the first named author's result for the compact case [13].
