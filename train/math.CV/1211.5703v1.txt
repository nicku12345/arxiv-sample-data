For 0<p<\infty  we let \mathcal D^p_{p-1} denote the space of those functions f which are analytic in the unit disc \mathbb D  and satisfy \int_\mathbb D (1-| z|)\sp {p-1}| f'(z)| \sp p\,dA(z)<\infty . It is known that, whenever p\neq q, the only multiplier from \mathcal D^p_{p-1}  to \mathcal D^q_{q-1}  is the trivial one. However, if X is a subspace of the Bloch space and 0<p\le q<\infty, then X \cap \mathcal D^p_{p-1}\subset X\cap \mathcal D^q_{q-1} , a fact which implies that the space of multipliers \M(\mathcal D^p_{p-1}\cap X, \mathcal D^q_{q-1} \cap X) is non-trivial. In this paper we study the spaces of multipliers \M(\mathcal D^p_{p-1}\cap X, v\cap X) (0<p,q<\infty ) for distinct classical subspaces X of the Bloch space. Specifically, we shall take X to be H^\infty , BMOA and the Bloch space \mathcal B .
