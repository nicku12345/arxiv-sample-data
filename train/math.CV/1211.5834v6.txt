The present paper is devoted to the study of classes of mappings with non--bounded characteristics of quasiconformality. It is proved that the normal families of mappings distorting the families of mappings in {\Bbb R}^n by special way, have the logarithmic order of growth in the neighborhood of every point. There are proved some sufficient conditions of normality of such mappings f:D\rightarrow \bar{{\Bbb R}^n}, n\ge 2, omitting the values of some set E_f with some constraints of the type c(E_f)\ge \delta, \delta\in {\Bbb R}, where c(\cdot) is the special set function.
