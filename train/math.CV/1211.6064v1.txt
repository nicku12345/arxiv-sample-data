We prove a boundary version of the open mapping theorem for holomorphic maps between strongly pseudoconvex domains. That is, we prove that the local image of a holomorphic map f:D\to D' close to a boundary regular contact point p\in \de D where the Jacobian is bounded from zero along normal non-tangential directions has to eventually contain every cone (and more generally every admissible region) with vertex at f(p).
