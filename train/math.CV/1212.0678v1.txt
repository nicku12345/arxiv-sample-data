We give an overview of some recent developments concerning harmonic and other moments of plane domains, their relationship to the Cauchy and exponential transforms, and to the meromorphic resultant and elimination function. The paper also connects to certain topics in mathematical physics, for example domain deformations generated by harmonic gradients (Laplacian growth) and related integrable structures.
