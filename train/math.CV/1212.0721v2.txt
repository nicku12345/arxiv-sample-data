Given a bounded domain D \subset {\mathbb R}^n strictly starlike with respect to 0 \in D\,, we define a quasi-inversion w.r.t. the boundary \partial D \,. We show that the quasi-inversion is bi-Lipschitz w.r.t. the chordal metric if and only if every "tangent line" of \partial D is far away from the origin. Moreover, the bi-Lipschitz constant tends to 1, when \partial D approaches the unit sphere in a suitable way. For the formulation of our results we use the concept of the \alpha-tangent condition due to F. W. Gehring and J. V\"ais\"al\"a (Acta Math. 1965). This condition is shown to be equivalent to the bi-Lipschitz and quasiconformal extension property of what we call the polar parametrization of \partial D. In addition, we show that the polar parametrization, which is a mapping of the unit sphere onto \partial D\,, is bi-Lipschitz if and only if D satisfies the \alpha-tangent condition.
