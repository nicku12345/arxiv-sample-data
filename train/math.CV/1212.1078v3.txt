In this paper we investigate the regularity properties of weighted Bergman projections for smoothly bounded pseudo-convex domains of finite type in \mathbb{C}^{n}. The main result is obtained for weights equal to a non negative rational power of the absolute value of a special defining function \rho of the domain: we prove (weighted) Sobolev-L^{p} and Lipchitz estimates for domains in \mathbb{C}^{2} (or, more generally, for domains having a Levi form of rank \geq n-2 and for "decoupled" domains) and for convex domains. In particular, for these defining functions, we generalize results obtained by A. Bonami & S. Grellier and D. C. Chang & B. Q. Li. We also obtain a general (weighted) Sobolev-L^{2} estimate.
