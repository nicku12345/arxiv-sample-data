Let X be a Hermitian complex space of pure dimension with only isolated singularities and p: M -> X a resolution of singularities. Let D be a relatively compact domain in X with no singularities in the boundary, D^*=D-Sing(X) the regular part of D and D'=p^{-1}(D) the preimage of D under p. We relate L2-properties of the dbar and the dbar-Neumann operator on D^* to properties of the corresponding operators on D' (where the situation is classically well understood). Outside some middle degrees, there are compact solution operators for the dbar-equation on D^* exactly if there are such operators on the resolution D', and the dbar-Neumann operator is compact on D^* exactly if it is compact on D'.
