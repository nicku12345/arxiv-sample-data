We give a H\"ormander type L^2-estimate for the \bar{\partial}-equation with respect to the measure \delta_\Omega^{-\alpha}dV, \alpha<1, on any bounded pseudoconvex domain with C^2-boundary. Several applications to the function theory of weighed Bergman spaces A^2_\alpha(\Omega) are given, including a corona type theorem, a Gleason type theorem, together with a density theorem. We investigate in particular the boundary behavior of functions in A^2_\alpha(\Omega) by proving an analogue of the Levi problem for A^2_\alpha(\Omega) and giving an optimal Gehring type estimate for functions in A^2_\alpha(\Omega). A vanishing theorem for A^2_1(\Omega) is established for arbitrary bounded domains. Relations between the weighted Bergman kernel and the Szeg\"o kernel are also discussed.
