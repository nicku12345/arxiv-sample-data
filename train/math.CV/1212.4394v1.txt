First we establish some generic universalities for Pad\'{e} approximants in the closure X^\infty(\OO) in A^\infty(\OO) of all rational functions with poles off \oO, the closure taken in \C of the domain \OO\subset\C.\ Next we give sufficient conditions on \OO so that X^\infty(\OO)=A^\infty(\OO).\ Some of these conditions imply that, even if the boundary \partial\OO of a Jordan domain \OO has infinite length, the integration operator on \OO preserves H^\infty(\OO) and A(\OO) as well.\ We also give an example of a Jordan domain \OO and a function f\in A(\OO), such that its antiderivative is not bounded on \OO.\ Finally we restate these results for Volterra operators on the open unit disc D and we complete them by some generic results.
