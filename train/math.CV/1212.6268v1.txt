It is known (implicit in [HMNT]) that when \Lambda is an interpolating sequence for the Nevanlinna or the Smirnov class then there exist functions f_\lambda in these spaces, with uniform control of their growth and attaining values 1 on \lambda and 0 in all other \lambda'\neq\lambda. We provide an example showing that, contrary to what happens in other algebras of holomorphic functions, the existence of such functions does not imply that \Lambda is an interpolating sequence.
