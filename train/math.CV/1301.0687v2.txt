The main aim of this article is to give some sufficient conditions for a family of meromorphic mappings on a domain D in C^n into P^N(C) to be meromorphically normal if they satisfy only some very weak conditions with respect to moving hypersurfaces in P^N(C), namely that their intersections with these moving hypersurfaces, which may moreover depend on the meromorphic maps, are in some sense uniform. Our results generalise and complete previous results in this area, especially the works of Fujimoto, Tu, Tu-Li, Mai-Thai-Trang and the recent work of Quang-Tan.
