For given two harmonic functions \Phi and \Psi with real coefficients in the open unit disk \mathbb{D}, we study a class of harmonic functions f(z)=z-\sum_{n=2}^{\infty}A_nz^{n}+\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}B_n\bar{z}^n (A_n, B_n \geq 0) satisfying \[\RE \frac{(f*\Phi)(z)}{(f*\Psi)(z)}>\alpha \quad (0\leq \alpha <1, z \in \mathbb{D});\] * being the harmonic convolution. Coefficient inequalities, growth and covering theorems, as well as closure theorems are determined. The results obtained extend several known results as special cases. In addition, we study the class of harmonic functions f that satisfy \RE f(z)/z>\alpha (0\leq \alpha <1, z \in \mathbb{D}). As an application, their connection with certain integral transforms and hypergeometric functions is established.
