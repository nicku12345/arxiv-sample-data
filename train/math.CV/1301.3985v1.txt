We prove a theorem on distortion of cross ratio of four points under the mapping effected by a complex polynomial with restricted critical values. Its corollaries include inequalities involving the absolute value and certain coefficients of a polynomial. In particular, an exact lower bound is established for maximal moduli of critical values of polynomials P of degree n normalized by P(0)=0, P'(0)\ne0.
