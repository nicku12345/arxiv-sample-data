Let \Omega be a m-hyperconvex domain of \mathbb{C}^n and \beta be the standard K\"{a}hler form in \mathbb{C}^n. We introduce finite energy classes of m-subharmonic functions of Cegrell type, \mathcal{E}_m^p, p>0 and \mathcal{F}_m. Using a variational method we show that the degenerate complex Hessian equation (dd^c\varphi)^m\wedge \beta^{n-m}=\mu has a unique solution in \mathcal{E}_m^1 if and only if every function in \mathcal{E}_m^1 is integrable with respect to \mu. If \mu has finite total mass and does not charge m-polar sets, then the equation has a unique solution in \mathcal{F}_m.
