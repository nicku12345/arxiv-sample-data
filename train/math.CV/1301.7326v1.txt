In this paper, we study the problem of finding the extremal element for a linear functional over a uniformly convex Banach space. We show that a unique extremal element exists and depends continuously on the linear functional, and vice versa. Using this, we simplify and clarify Ryabykh's proof that for any linear functional on a uniformly convex Bergman space with kernel in a certain Hardy space, the extremal functional belongs to the corresponding Hardy space.
