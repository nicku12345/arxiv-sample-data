The purpose of this article is twofold. The first is to prove a second main theorem for meromorphic mappings of \C^m into a complex projective variety intersecting hypersurfaces in subgeneral position with truncated counting functions. The second is to show a uniqueness theorem for these mappings which share few hypersurfaces without counting multiplicity.
