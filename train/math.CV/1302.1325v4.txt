In this paper, we will show that if two meromorphic mappings f and g of \mathbb C^m into \mathbb P^n(\mathbb C) have the same inverse images for (2n+2) moving hyperplanes \{a_i\}_{i=1}^{2n+2} with multiplicities counted to level l_0 then the map f\times g must be algebraically degenerated over the field \mathcal R\{a_i\}_{i=1}^{2n+2}, where l_0=3n^3(n+1)q(q-2) with q=\binom{2n+2}{n+2}. Our result generalizes the previous result for fixed hyperplanes case of Fujimoto and also improves his result by giving an explicit estimate for the number l_0.
