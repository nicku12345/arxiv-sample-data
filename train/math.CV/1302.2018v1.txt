In this paper, we introduce a class of complex-valued polyharmonic mappings, denoted by HS_{p}(\lambda), and its subclass HS_{p}^{0}(\lambda), where \lambda\in [0,1] is a constant. These classes are natural generalizations of a class of mappings studied by Goodman in 1950's. We generalize the main results of Avci and Z{\l}otkiewicz from 1990's to the classes HS_{p}(\lambda) and HS_{p}^{0}(\lambda), showing that the mappings in HS_{p}(\lambda) are univalent and sense preserving. We also prove that the mappings in HS_{p}^{0}(\lambda) are starlike with respect to the origin, and characterize the extremal points of the above classes.
