Let p:X\longrightarrow M be a Riemann domain over a connected n-dimensional complex submanifold M of \mathbb C^N and let \mathcal F\subset\mathcal O(X) be such that p\in\mathcal F^N. Our aim is to discuss relations between the \mathcal F-envelope of holomorphy of (X,p) in the sense of Riemann domains over M and the \mathcal F-envelope of holomorphy of X in the sense of complex manifolds.
