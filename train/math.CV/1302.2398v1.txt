In this paper, we first find an estimate for the range of polyharmonic mappings in the class HC_{p}^{0}. Then, we obtain two characterizations in terms of the convolution for polyharmonic mappings to be starlike of order \alpha, and convex of order \beta, respectively. Finally, we study the radii of starlikeness and convexity for polyharmonic mappings, under certain coefficient conditions.
