In general, while obtaining the probability density function of sums and products of shifted random variables, ordinary analytical methods such as Fourier and Mellin transforms tend to provide integrals which cannot be expressed in terms of ordinary Meijer G and H functions. This way, the need of defining new functions which easily enable one to write such integrals in a closed-form is inherent to the development of this area of statistical sciences. By generalizing the Mellin transform which defines the H function, a new function is established. A direct application of the so-called \widehat{I} is discussed while developing the probability density function of the sum and the product of shifted generalized gamma random variables. Important special cases of the \widehat{I} and their applications in science are also discussed in order to show the applicability of the function hereby defined.
