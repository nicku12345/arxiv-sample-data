We prove the existence of holomorphic functions f defined on any open convex subset {\rm \Omega}\subset {{\mathbb C}}^n, whose partial sums of the Taylor developments approximate uniformly any complex polynomial on any convex compact set disjoint from \bar{{\rm \Omega}} and on denumerably many convex compact sets in {{\mathbb C}}^n\backslash {\rm \Omega} which may meet the boundary \partial {\rm \Omega}. If the universal approximation is only required on convex compact sets disjoint from \bar{{\rm \Omega}}, then f may be chosen to be smooth on \partial {\rm \Omega}, that is f\in A^{\infty}({\rm \Omega}). Those are generic universalities.
