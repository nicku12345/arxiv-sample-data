During the course of verifying the results of Ramanujan on hypergeometric series, Berndt in his notebooks, Part II mentioned corrected forms of two of the Ramanujan's results.   The aim of this short research note is to point out that one of the results obtained by Ramanujan is correct (and not of Berndt's result) and the second result (which is slightly differ from Ramanujan's result and Berndt's result) is given here in corrected form.
