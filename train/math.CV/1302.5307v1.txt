The central purpose of the present paper is to study boundary behavior of squeezing functions on bounded domains. We prove that the squeezing function of a strongly pseudoconvex domain tends to 1 near the boundary. In fact, such an estimate is proved for the squeezing function on any domain near its globally strongly convex boundary points. We also study the stability of squeezing functions on a sequence of bounded domains, and give comparisons of intrinsic measures and metrics on bounded domains in terms of squeezing functions. As applications, we give new and simple proofs of several well known results about geometry of strongly pseudoconvex domains, and prove that all Cartan-Hartogs domains are homogenous regular. Finally, some related problems that ask for further study are proposed.
