Let \mathcal{H} denote the class of all complex-valued harmonic functions f in the open unit disk normalized by f(0)=0=f_{z}(0)-1=f_{\bar{z}}(0), and let \mathcal{A} be the subclass of \mathcal{H} consisting of normalized analytic functions. For \phi \in \mathcal{A}, let \mathcal{W}_{H}^{-}(\phi):=\{f=h+\bar{g} \in \mathcal{H}:h-g=\phi\} and \mathcal{W}_{H}^{+}(\phi):=\{f=h+\bar{g} \in \mathcal{H}:h+g=\phi\} be subfamilies of \mathcal{H}. In this paper, we shall determine the conditions under which the harmonic convolution f_1*f_2 is univalent and convex in one direction if f_1 \in \mathcal{W}_{H}^{-}(z) and f_2 \in \mathcal{W}_{H}^{-}(\phi). A similar analysis is carried out if f_1 \in \mathcal{W}_{H}^{-}(z) and f_2 \in \mathcal{W}_{H}^{+}(\phi). Examples of univalent harmonic mappings constructed by way of convolution are also presented.
