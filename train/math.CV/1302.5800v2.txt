We provide a positive answer to Zariski's conjecture for families of singular surfaces in \mathbb C^3, under the condition that the family has a smooth normalisation. As a corollary of the result, we obtain a surprising characterization of the Whitney equisingularity of one parameter families of \mathcal A finitely determined map-germs f_t: (\mathbb C^2,0) \to (\mathbb C^3,0), in terms of the constancy of only one invariant, the Milnor number of the double point locus.
