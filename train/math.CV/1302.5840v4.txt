We show that under a condition of the Calderon type on \varphi the homeomorphisms f with finite distortion in W^{1,\varphi}_{\rm loc} and, in particular, f\in W^{1,s}_{\rm loc} for s>n-1 are the so-called lower Q-homeomorphisms with respect to p-modulus where Q(x) is equal to its outer p-dilatation K_{p,f}(x).
