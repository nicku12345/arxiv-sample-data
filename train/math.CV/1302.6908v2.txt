Let H[a_0,n] be the class of functions p(z)=a_0+a_nz^n+... which are analytic in the open unit disk U. For p(z)in H[1,2], M. Nunokawa, S. Owa, N. Uyanik and H. Shiraishi (Math. Comput. Modelling. 55 (2012), 1245-1250) have shown some theorems for argument properties. The object of the present paper is to discuss some extensions of Nnnokawa lemma and its applications for argument properties.
