Let  P(z)  be a polynomial of degree  n  having all zeros in |z|\leq k where k\leq 1, then it was proved by Dewan \textit{et al} that for every real or complex number \alpha with |\alpha|\geq k and each r\geq 0    n(|\alpha|-k)\left\{\int\limits_{0}^{2\pi}\left|P\left(e^{i\theta}\right)\right|^r d\theta\right\}^{\frac{1}{r}}\leq\left\{\int\limits_{0}^{2\pi}\left|1+ke^{i\theta}\right|^r d\theta\right\}^{\frac{1}{r}}\underset{|z|=1}{Max}|D_\alpha P(z)|.    \indent In this paper, we shall present a refinement and generalization of above result and also extend it to the class of polynomials P(z)=a_nz^n+\sum_{\nu=\mu}^{n}a_{n-\nu}z^{n-\nu}, 1\leq\mu\leq n, having all its zeros in |z|\leq k where k\leq 1 and thereby obtain certain generalizations of above and many other known results.
