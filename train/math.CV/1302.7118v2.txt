The discrete Chebyshev polynomials t_n(x,N) are orthogonal with respect to a distribution, which is a step function with jumps one unit at the points x=0,1,\cdots, N-1, N being a fixed positive integer. By using a double integral representation, we have recently obtained asymptotic expansions for t_{n}(aN,N+1) in the double scaling limit, namely, N\rightarrow\infty and n/N\rightarrow b, where b\in (0,1) and a\in(-\infty,\infty); see [Studies in Appl. Math. \textbf{128} (2012), 337-384]. In the present paper, we continue to investigate the behaviour of these polynomials when the parameter b approaches the endpoints of the interval (0,1). While the case b\rightarrow 1 is relatively simple (since it is very much like the case when b is fixed), the case b\rightarrow 0 is quite complicated. The discussion of the latter case is divided into several subcases, depending on the quantities n, x and xN/n^2, and different special functions have been used as approximants, including Airy, Bessel and Kummer functions.
