We describe all complex geodesics in convex tube domains. In the case when the base of a convex tube domain does not contain any real line, the obtained description involves the notion of boundary measure of a holomorphic map and it is expressed in the language of real Borel measures on the unit circle. Applying our result, we calculate all complex geodesics in convex tube domains with unbounded base covering special class of Reinhardt domains.
