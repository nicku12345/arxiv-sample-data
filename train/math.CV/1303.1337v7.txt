The paper is devoted to the study of mappings with non--bounded characteristics of quasiconformality. We investigate the interconnection between the classes of the so-called ring Q-mappings and lower ring Q-mappings. It is proved that open discrete lower ring Q-mappings are ring Q^{n-1}-mappings at fixed point. As consequence we obtain the equicontinuity of the class of the open discrete Orlicz--Sobolev mappings with finite distortion at n\ge 3.
