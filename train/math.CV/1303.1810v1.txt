We show the existence of free dense subgroups, generated by 2 elements, in the holomorphic shear and overshear group of complex-Euklidean space and extend this result to the group of holomorphic automorphisms of Stein manifolds with Density Property, provided there exists a generalized translation. The conjugation operator associated to this generalized translation is hypercyclic on the topological space of holomorphic automorphisms.
