Let n>1 be an integer. We prove that holomorphic maps from Stein manifolds X of dimension <n to the complement \mathbb{C}^n\setminus L of a compact convex set L\subset\mathbb{C}^n satisfy the basic Oka property with approximation and interpolation. If L is polynomially convex then the same holds when 2\dim X < n. We also construct proper holomorphic maps, immersions and embeddings X\to\mathbb{C}^n with additional control of the range, thereby extending classical results of Remmert, Bishop and Narasimhan.
