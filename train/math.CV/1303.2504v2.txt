In this paper we extend the concept of bi-univalent to the class of meromorphic functions. We propose to investigate the coefficient estimates for two classes of meromorphic bi-univalent functions. Also, we find estimates on the coefficients |b0| and |b1| for functions in these new classes. Some interesting remarks and applications of the results presented here are also discussed.
