Inspired by the recent works of Srivastava et al. (HMS-AKM-PG), Frasin and Aouf (BAF-MKA) and others (Ali-Ravi-Ma-Mina-class,Caglar-Orhan,Goyal-Goswami,Xu-HMS-AML,Xu-HMS-AMC), we propose to investigate the coefficient estimates for a general class of analytic and bi-univalent functions. Also, we obtain estimates on the coefficients |a2| and |a3| for functions in this new class. Some interesting remarks, corollaries and applications of the results presented here are also discussed.
