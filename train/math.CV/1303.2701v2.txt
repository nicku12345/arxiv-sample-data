Let p:\sXS be a proper K\"ahler fibration and \sE\sX a Hermitian holomorphic vector bundle.   As motivated by the work of Berndtsson(\cite{Berndtsson09a}), by using basic Hodge theory, we derive several general curvature formulas for the direct image p_*(K_{\sX/S}\ts \sE) for general Hermitian holomorphic vector bundle \sE in a simple way.   A straightforward application is that, if the family \sXS is infinitesimally trivial and Hermitian vector bundle \sE is Nakano-negative along the base S, then the direct image p_*(K_{\sX/S}\ts \sE) is Nakano-negative. We also use these curvature formulas to study the moduli space of projectively flat vector bundles with positive first Chern classes and obtain that, if the Chern curvature of direct image p_*(K_{X}\ts E)--of a positive projectively flat family (E,h(t))_{t\in \mathbb D}X--vanishes, then the curvature forms of this family are connected by holomorphic automorphisms of the pair (X,E).
