In the present paper we introduce and studied two subclasses of multivalent functions denoted by \mathcal{M}^{\lambda}_{p,n}(\gamma;\beta) and \mathcal{N}^{\lambda}_{p,n}(\mu,\eta;\delta). Further, by giving specific values of the parameters of our main results, we will find some connection between these two classes, and moreover, several consequences of main results are also discussed.
