In this paper, we first investigate coefficient estimates for bounded polyharmonic mappings in the unit disk \mathbb{D}. Then, we obtain two versions of Landau's theorem for polyharmonics mapping F, and for the mappings of the type L(F), where L is the differential operator of Abdulhadi, Abu Muhanna and Khuri. Examples and numerical estimates are given.
