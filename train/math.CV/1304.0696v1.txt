Let W_{\beta}(\alpha,\gamma), \beta<1, denote the class of all normalized analytic functions f in the unit disc {\mathbb{D}}=\{z\in {\mathbb{C}}: |z|<1\} such that \begin{align*} {\rm Re\,} \left(e^{i\phi}\left((1-\alpha+2\gamma)\frac{f}{z}+(\alpha-2\gamma)f'+\gamma zf"-\beta\right)\frac{}{}\right)>0, \quad z\in {\mathbb{D}}, \end{align*} for some \phi\in {\mathbb{R}} with \alpha\geq 0, \gamma\geq 0 and \beta< 1. Let M(\xi), 0\leq \xi\leq 1, denote the Pascu class of \xi-convex functions given by the analytic condition \begin{align*} {\rm Re\,}\frac{\xi z(zf'(z))'+(1-\xi)zf'(z)}{\xi zf'(z)+(1-\xi)f(z)}>0 \end{align*} which unifies the class of starlike and convex functions. The aim of this paper is to find conditions on \lambda(t) so that the integral transforms of the form \begin{align*} V_{\lambda}(f)(z)= \int_0^1 \lambda(t) \frac{f(tz)}{t} dt. \end{align*} carry functions from W_{\beta}(\alpha,\gamma) into M(\xi). As applications, for specific values of \lambda(t), it is found that several known integral operators carry functions from W_{\beta}(\alpha,\gamma) into M(\xi). Results for a more generalized operator related to V_\lambda(f)(z) are also given.
