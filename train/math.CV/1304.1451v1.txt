We give a necessary and sufficient condition for a measure \mu in the closed unit disk to be a reverse Carleson measure for Hardy spaces. This extends a previous result of Lef\'evre, Li, Queff\'elec and Rodr\'{\i}guez-Piazza \cite{LLQR}. We also provide a simple example showing that the analogue for the Paley-Wiener space does not hold. This example can be generalised to model spaces associated to one-component inner functions.
