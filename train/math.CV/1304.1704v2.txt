Using a recent result of L\'arusson and Poletsky regarding plurisubharmonic subextensions we prove a disc formula for the quasiplurisubharmonic global extremal function for domains in complex projective space. As a corollary we get a characterization of the projective hull for connected compact sets in complex projective space by the existence of analytic discs.
