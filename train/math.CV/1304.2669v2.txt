We prove the existence of normal forms for some local real-analytic Levi-flat hypersurfaces with an isolated line singularity. We also give sufficient conditions for that a Levi-flat hypersurface with a complex line as singularity to be a pullback of a real-analytic curve in C via a holomorphic function.
