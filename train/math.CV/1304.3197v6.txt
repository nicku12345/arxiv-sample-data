The paper presents some recent results on the Weil-Petersson geometry theory of the universal Teichm\"uller space, a topic which is important in Teichm\"uller theory and has wide applications to various areas such as mathematical physics, differential equation and computer vision.   \noindent (1) It is shown that a sense-preserving homeomorphism h on the unit circle belongs to the Weil-Petersson class, namely, h can be extended to a quasiconformal mapping to the unit disk whose Beltrami coefficient is squarely integrable in the Poincar\'e metric if and only if h is absolutely continuous such that \log h' belongs to the Sobolev class H^{\frac 12}. This solves an open problem posed by Takhtajan-Teo [TT2] in 2006 and investigated later by Figalli [Fi], Gay-Balmaz-Marsden-Ratiu ([GMR], [GR]) and others.   \noindent The intrinsic characterization (1) of the Weil-Petersson class has the following applications which are also explored in this paper:   \noindent (2) It is proved that there exists a quasisymmetric homeomorphism of the Weil-Petersson class which belongs neither to the Sobolev class H^{\frac 32} nor to the Lipschitz class \Lambda^1, which was conjectured very recently by Gay-Balmaz-Ratiu [GR] when studying the classical Euler-Poincar\'e equation in the new setting that the involved sense-preserving homeomorphisms on the unit circle belong to the Weil-Petersson class.   \noindent (3) It is proved that the flows of the H^{\frac 32} vector fields on the unit circle are contained in the Weil-Petersson class, which was also conjectured by Gay-Balmaz-Ratiu [GR] during their above mentioned research.   \noindent (4) A new metric is introduced on the Weil-Petersson Teichm\"uller space and is shown to be topologically equivalent to the Weil-Petersson metric.
