In this paper we introduce a class of pseudo-dissipative holomorphic maps which contains, in particular, the class of infinitesimal generators of semigroups of holomorphic maps on the unit ball of a complex Banach space. We give a growth estimate for maps of this class. In particular, it follows that pseudo-dissipative maps on the unit ball of (infinite-dimensional) Banach spaces are bounded on each domain strictly contained inside the ball. We also present some applications.
