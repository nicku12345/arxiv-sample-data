We show how to obtain the difference function of the Weierstrass Zeta function very directly, by choosing an appropriate order of summation for the series defining this function. As a byproduct, we show how to obtain the quasi-modularity of the weight 2 Eisenstein series immediately from the fact that it appears in this difference function and the homogeneity properties of the latter.
