We develop an isotopy principle for holomorphic motions. Our main result concerns the extendability of a holomorphic motion of a finite subset E of a Riemann surface Y parameterized by a point t in a pointed hyperbolic surface (X, t_{0}). If a holomorphic motion from E to E_{t} in Y has a guiding quasiconformal isotopy, then there is a holomorphic extension to any new point p in Y-E that follows the guiding isotopy. The proof gives a canonical way to replace a quasiconformal motion of the (n+1)^{th} point by a holomorphic motion while leaving unchanged the given holomorphic motion of the first n points. In particular, our main result gives a new proof of Slodkowski's theorem which concerns the special case when the parameter space is the open unit disk with base point 0 and the dynamical space Y is the Riemann sphere.
