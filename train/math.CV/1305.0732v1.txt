Recently, Ali et al defined the class \mathcal{W}_{\beta}(\alpha, \gamma) consisting of functions f which satisfy \Re e^{i\phi}\left((1-\alpha+2\gamma)\frac{f(z)}{z}+(\alpha-2\gamma)f'(z)+\gamma zf''(z)-\beta\right)>0, for all z\in E=\left\{z : |z|<1\right\} and for \alpha, \gamma\geq0 and \beta<1, \phi\in \mathbb{R} (the set of reals). For f\in{\mathcal{W}_{\beta}(\alpha, \gamma)}, they discussed the convexity of the integral transform V_{\lambda}(f)(z):=\int_{0}^{1}\lambda(t)\frac{f(tz)}{t}dt, where \lambda is a non-negative real-valued integrable function satisfying the condition \displaystyle\int_{0}^{1}\lambda(t)dt=1. The aim of present paper is to find conditions on \lambda(t) such that V_{\lambda}(f) is convex of order \delta (0\leq\delta\leq1/2) whenever f\in{\mathcal{W}}_{\beta}(\alpha, \gamma). As applications, we study various choices of \lambda(t), related to classical integral transforms.
