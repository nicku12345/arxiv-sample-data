We investigate the boundary behavior of holomorphic functions with respect to a family of curves in a domain of finite type. This work is a generalization of \u{C}irka's classical result on the unit ball and it supplements the result by Cima and Krantz on the Lindel\"{o}f principle for general domains. See [KRA2] for some recent developments in this subject
