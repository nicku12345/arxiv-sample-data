Based on dynamical behavior, all self-maps of the unit disk in the complex plane can be classified as elliptic, hyperbolic or parabolic. The parabolic case is the most complicated one and branches into two subcases - zero-step and non-zero-step cases. In several dimensions, zero-step and non-zero step cases can be defined for sequences of forward iterates, but it is not known yet if the classification can be extended to parabolic maps of the ball. However, some geometric properties of the forward iterates can be generalized to higher-dimensional case.
