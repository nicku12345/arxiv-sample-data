We give an example of a pseudoconvex domain in a complex manifold whose L^2-Dolbeault cohomology is non-Hausdorff, yet the domain is Stein. The domain is a smoothly bounded Levi-flat domain in a two complex-dimensional compact complex manifold. The domain is biholomorphic to a product domain in \mathbb{C}^2, hence Stein. This implies that for q>0, the usual Dolbeault cohomology with respect to smooth forms vanishes in degree (p,q). But the L^2-Cauchy-Riemann operator on the domain does not have closed range on (2,1)-forms and consequently its L^2-Dolbeault cohomology is not Hausdorff.
