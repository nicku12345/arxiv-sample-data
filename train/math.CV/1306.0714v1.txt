If P(z) be a polynomial of degree at most n which does not vanish in |z| < 1, it was recently formulated by Shah and Liman \cite[\textit{Integral estimates for the family of B-operators, Operators and Matrices,} \textbf{5}(2011), 79 - 87]{wl} that for every R\geq 1, p\geq 1,   \[\left\|B[P\circ\sigma](z)\right\|_p \leq\frac{R^{n}|\Lambda_n|+|\lambda_{0}|}{\left\|1+z\right\|_p}\left\|P(z)\right\|_p,\] where B is a  \mathcal{B}_{n}-operator with parameters \lambda_{0}, \lambda_{1}, \lambda_{2} in the sense of Rahman \cite{qir}, \sigma(z)=Rz and \Lambda_n=\lambda_{0}+\lambda_{1}\frac{n^{2}}{2} +\lambda_{2}\frac{n^{3}(n-1)}{8}. Unfortunately the proof of this result is not correct. In this paper, we present a more general sharp L_p-inequalities for \mathcal{B}_{n}-operators which not only provide a correct proof of the above inequality as a special case but also extend them for  0 \leq p <1 as well.
