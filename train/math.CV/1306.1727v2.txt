In the present paper, we introduce a family of univalent harmonic functions, which map the unit disk onto domains convex in the direction of the imaginary axis. We find conditions for the linear combinations of mappings from this family to be univalent and convex in the direction of the imaginary axis. Linear combinations of functions from this family and harmonic mappings obtained by shearing of analytic vertical strip maps are also studied.
