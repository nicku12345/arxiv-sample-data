In this paper we extend results due to Vogt on line bundles over Cousin groups to the case of domains stable by the maximal compact subgroup. This is used in the sequel to show that the algebraic dimension of OT-manifolds is zero. In the last part we establish that certain Cousin groups, in particular those arising from the construction of OT-manifolds, have finite-dimensional irregularity.
