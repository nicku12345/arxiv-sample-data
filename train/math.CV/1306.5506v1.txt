The subject of this paper is the bounded level curves of a meromorphic function f with domain G such that each component of \partial{G} consists of a level curve of f. (A primary example of such a function being a ratio of finite Blaschke products of different degrees, with domain \mathbb{D}.) We will first prove several facts about a single bounded level curve of a f in isolation from the other level curves of f. We will then study how the level curves of f lie with respect to each other. It is natural to expect that the sets \{z:|f(z)|=\epsilon\} vary continuously as \epsilon varies. We will make this notion explicit, and use this continuity to prove several results about the bounded level curves of f. It is well known that if z_0 is a zero or a pole of f, then f is conformally equivalent to the function z\mapsto{z^k} (for some k\in\mathbb{Z}) in a neighborhood of z_0. We generalize this fact by finding a natural decomposition of G into finitely many sub-regions (also bounded by level curves of f), on each of which f is conformally equivalent to z\mapsto{z^k} (for some k\in\mathbb{Z}). Also included is a new proof, using level curves, of the Gauss--Lucas theorem that the critical points of a polynomial are contained in the convex hull of the polynomial's zeros.
