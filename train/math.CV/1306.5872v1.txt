Given a polynomial \T_n of degree n, consider the inverse image of \R and [-1,1], denoted by \T_n^{-1}(\R) and \T_n^{-1}([-1,1]), respectively. It is well known that \T_n^{-1}(\R) consists of n analytic Jordan arcs moving from \infty to \infty. In this paper, we give a necessary and sufficient condition such that (1) \T_n^{-1}([-1,1]) consists of \nu analytic Jordan arcs and (2) \T_n^{-1}([-1,1]) is connected, respectively.
