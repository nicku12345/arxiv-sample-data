We discuss the problem of embedding univalent functions into Loewner chains in higher dimension. In particular, we prove that a normalized univalent map of the ball in \C^n whose image is a smooth strongly pseudoconvex domain is embeddable into a normalized Loewner chain (satisfying also some extra regularity properties) if and only if the closure of the image is polynomially convex.
