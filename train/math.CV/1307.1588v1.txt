We prove a noncommutative analogue of the fact that every symmetric analytic function of (z,w) in the bidisc \D^2 can be expressed as an analytic function of the variables z+w and zw. We construct an analytic nc-map S from the biball to an infinite-dimensional nc-domain \Omega with the property that, for every bounded symmetric function \ph of two noncommuting variables that is analytic on the biball, there exists a bounded analytic nc-function \Phi on \Omega such that \ph=\Phi\circ S. We also establish a realization formula for \Phi, and hence for \ph, in terms of operators on Hilbert space.
