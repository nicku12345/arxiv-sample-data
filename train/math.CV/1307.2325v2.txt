We are interested in several informal statements referred as "Kontinuit\"atssatz" in the recent literature on analytic continuation. The basic (unstated) principle that seems to be in use in these works appears to be a folk theorem. We provide a precise statement of this folk Kontinuit\"atssatz and give a proof of it.
