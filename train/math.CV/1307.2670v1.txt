For the full range of index 0<p\leq\infty, real weight \alpha and real Sobolev order s, two types of weighted Fock-Sobolev spaces over \mathbb C^n, F^p_{\alpha, s} and \widetilde F^p_{\alpha,s}, are introduced through fractional differentiation and through fractional integration, respectively. We show that they are the same with equivalent norms and, furthermore, that they are identified with the weighted Fock space F^p_{\alpha-sp,0} for the full range of parameters. So, the study on the weighted Fock-Sobolev spaces is reduced to that on the weighted Fock spaces. We describe explicitly the reproducing kernels for the weighted Fock spaces and then establish the boundedness of integral operators induced by the reproducing kernels. We also identify dual spaces, obtain complex interpolation result and characterize Carleson measures.
