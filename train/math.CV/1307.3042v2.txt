Suppose that a transcendental meromorphic function in the plane has finitely many critical values, while its multiple points have bounded multiplicities, and its inverse function has finitely many transcendental singularities. Using the Wiman-Valiron method it is shown that the Schwarzian derivative does not have a direct transcendental singularity over infinity, and does not have infinity as a Borel exceptional value.
