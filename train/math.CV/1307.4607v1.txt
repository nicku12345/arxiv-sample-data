We show that the \bar{\partial}-problem is globally regular on a domain in \mathbb{C}^n, which is the n-fold symmetric product of a smoothly bounded planar domain. Remmert-Stein type theorems are proved for proper holomorphic maps between equidimensional symmetric products and proper holomorphic maps from cartesian products to symmetric products. It is shown that proper holomorphic maps between equidimensional symmetric products of smooth planar domains are smooth up to the boundary
