We study the reverse triangle inequalities for suprema of logarithmic potentials on compact sets of the plane. This research is motivated by the inequalities for products of supremum norms of polynomials. We find sharp additive constants in the inequalities for potentials, and give applications of our results to the generalized polynomials.   We also obtain sharp inequalities for products of norms of the weighted polynomials w^nP_n, deg(P_n)\le n, and for sums of suprema of potentials with external fields. An important part of our work in the weighted case is a Riesz decomposition for the weighted farthest-point distance function.
