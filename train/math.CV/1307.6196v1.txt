We study inequalities for the infima of Green potentials on a compact subset of an arbitrary domain in the complex plane. The results are based on a new representation of the pseudohyperbolic farthest-point distance function via a Green potential. We also give applications to sharp inequalities for the supremum norms of Blaschke products.
