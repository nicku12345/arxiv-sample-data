We show that, given a non-degenerate, finitely connected domain D, its boundary, and the number of its boundary components, it is possible to compute a conformal mapping of D onto a circular domain \emph{without} prior knowledge of the circular domain. We do so by computing a suitable bound on the error in the Koebe construction (but, again, without knowing the circular domain in advance). As a scientifically sound model of computation with continuous data, we use Type-Two Effectivity.
