The method of Grunsky inequalities has many applications and has been extended in many directions, even to bordered Riemann surfaces. However, unlike the case of functions univalent in the disk, a quasiconformal variant of this theory has not been developed so far. In this paper, we essentially improve the basic facts concerning the classical Grunsky inequalities for univalent functions on the disk and extend these results to arbitrary quasiconformal disks. Several applications are given.
