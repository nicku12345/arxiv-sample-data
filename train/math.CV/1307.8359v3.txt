In the paper we study the geometry of semitube domains in \mathbb C^2. In particular, we extend the result of Burgu\'es and Dwilewicz for semitube domains dropping out the smoothness assumption. We also prove various properties of non-smooth pseudoconvex semitube domains obtaining among others a relation between pseudoconvexity of a semitube domain and the number of connected components of its vertical slices.   Finally, we present an example showing that there is a non-convex domain in \mathbb C^n such that its image under arbitrary isometry is pseudoconvex.
