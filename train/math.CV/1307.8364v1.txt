We construct a finitely dimensional invariant manifold of holomorphic discs attached to a certain class of smooth pseudconvex hypersurfaces of finite type in \C^2, generalizing the notion of stationary discs. The discs we construct are determined by a finite jet at a given boundary point and their centers fill an open set. As a consequence, we obtain a finite jet determination result for this class of smooth hypersurfaces.
