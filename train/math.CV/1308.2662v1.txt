Let \{f_{\lambda; j}\}_{\lambda\in V; 1\le j\le k} be families of holomorphic functions in the open unit disk \Di\subset\Co depending holomorphically on a parameter \lambda\in V\subset \Co^n. We establish a Rolle type theorem for the generalized multiplicity (called {\em cyclicity}) of zero of the family of univariate holomorphic functions {\sum_{j=1}^k f_{\lambda;j}}_{\lambda\in V} at 0\in\Di. As a corollary, we estimate the cyclicity of the family of generalized exponential polynomials, that is, the family of entire functions of the form \sum_{k=1}^m P_k(z)e^{Q_k(z)}, z\in\Co, where P_k and Q_k are holomorphic polynomials of degrees p and q, respectively, parameterized by vectors of coefficients of P_k and Q_k.
