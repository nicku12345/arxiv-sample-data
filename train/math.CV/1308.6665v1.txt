The Ramanujan _1\psi_1 summation theorem in studied from the perspective of q-Jackson integrals, q-difference equations and connection formulas. This is an approach which has previously been shown to yield Bailey's very-well-poised _6\psi_6 summation. Bilateral Jackson integral generalizations of the Dixon--Anderson and Selberg integrals relating to the type A root system are identified as natural candidates for multidimensional generalizations of the Ramanujan _1\psi_1 summation theorem. New results of this type are announced, and furthermore they are put into context by reviewing from previous literature explicit product formulas for Jackson integrals relating to other roots systems obtained from the same perspective.
