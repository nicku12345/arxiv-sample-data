We discuss a family M_t^n, with n\ge 2, t>1, of real hypersurfaces in a complex affine n-dimensional quadric arising in connection with the classification of homogeneous compact simply-connected real-analytic hypersurfaces in {\mathbb C}^n due to Morimoto and Nagano. To finalize their classification, one needs to resolve the problem of the embeddability of M_t^n in {\mathbb C}^n for n=3,7. We show that M_t^7 is not embeddable in {\mathbb C}^7 for every t and that M_t^3 is embeddable in {\mathbb C}^3 for all 1<t<1+10^{-6}. As a consequence of our analysis of a map constructed by Ahern and Rudin, we also conjecture that the embeddability of M_t^3 takes place for all\, 1<t<\sqrt{(2+\sqrt{2})/3}.
