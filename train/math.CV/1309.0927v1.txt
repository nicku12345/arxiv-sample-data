Analogues of the key results of Wiman-Valiron theory are proved for a class of functions meromorphic in the unit disc, based on an approach developed by Bergweiler, Rippon and Stallard for the plane setting. The results give local approximations for the function and its logarithmic derivative and, in the case of positive order of growth, for higher order logarithmic derivatives as well.
