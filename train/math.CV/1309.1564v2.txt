We investigate branching of solutions to holonomic bivariate hypergeometric systems of Horn's type. Special attention is paid to the invariant subspace of Puiseux polynomial solutions. We mainly study Horn systems defined by simplicial configurations and Horn systems whose Ore-Sato polygons are either zonotopes or Minkowski sums of a triangle and segments proportional to its sides. We prove a necessary and sufficient condition for the monodromy representation to be maximally reducible, that is, for the space of holomorphic solutions to split into the direct sum of one-dimensional invariant subspaces.
