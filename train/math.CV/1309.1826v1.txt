We consider the generic discrete open mappings in {\mathbb R}^n under which the perturbation of extremal lengths of curve collections is controlled integrally via \int Q(x)\eta^p(|x-x_0|) dm(x) with n-1<p<n, where Q is a measurable function on {\mathbb R}^n and \int\limits_{r_1}^{r_2} \eta(r) dr \ge 1 for any \eta on a given interval [r_1,r_2]. We proved that the family of all open discrete mappings of above type is normal under appropriate restrictions on the majorant Q.
