Using Ahlfors functions, Grunsky maps and the Bell representation theorem, we show that a certain subset of the rational maps of degree n forms a trivial bundle over the moduli space of non-degenerate n-connected domains with one marked tangent vector with fiber the n-fold symmetric product of the circle. A consequence is that the set of rational Ahlfors functions of degree n forms a closed embedded submanifold inside the space of rational maps of degree n. As an application, we show the existence of rational Ahlfors functions with non-positive residues, resolving a question left open in a previous paper by the authors.
