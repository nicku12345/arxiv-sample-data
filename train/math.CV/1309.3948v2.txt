In the study of holomorphic maps, the term "rigidity" refers to certain types of results that give us very specific information about a general class of holomorphic maps owing to the geometry of their domains or target spaces. Under this theme, we begin by studying when, given two compact connected complex manifolds X and Y, a degree-one holomorphic map f: Y\to X is a biholomorphism. Given that the real manifolds underlying X and Y are diffeomorphic, we provide a condition under which f is a biholomorphism. Using this result, we deduce a rigidity result for holomorphic self-maps of the total space of a holomorphic fiber space. Lastly, we consider products X=X_1\times X_2 and Y=Y_1\times Y_2 of compact connected complex manifolds. When X_1 is a Riemann surface of genus \geq 2, we show that any non-constant holomorphic map F:Y\to X is of a special form.
