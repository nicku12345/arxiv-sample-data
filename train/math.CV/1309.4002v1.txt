We study the asymptotic behavior of parabolic type semigroups acting on the unit disk as well as those acting on the right half-plane. We use the asymptotic behavior to investigate the local geometry of the semigroup trajectories near the boundary Denjoy--Wolff point. The geometric content includes, in particular, the asymptotes to trajectories, the so-called limit curvature, the order of contact, and so on. We then establish asymptotic rigidity properties for a broad class of semigroups of parabolic type.
