The paper gives a precise asymptotic relation between higher order logarithmic difference and logarithmic derivatives for meromorphic functions with order strictly less then one. This allows us to formulate a useful Wiman-Valiron type estimate for logarithmic difference of meromorphic functions of small order. We then apply this estimate to prove a classical analogue of Valiron about entire solutions to linear differential equations with polynomials coefficients for linear difference equations.
