In this paper we present a historical and scientific account of the development of the theory of the L\"owner-Kufarev classical and stochastic equations spanning the 90-year period from the seminal paper by K.L\"owner in 1923 to recent generalizations and stochastic versions and their relations to conformal field theory.
