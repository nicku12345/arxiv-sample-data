In this paper we study the boundary values of harmonic and holo- morphic functions in the weighted Hardy spaces on the unit disk \mathbb{D}. These spaces were introduced by Poletsky and Stessin in [6] for plurisubharmonic functions on hyperconvex domains D \subset \mathbb{C}^n as generalizations of classical Hardy spaces. We show that in the case when D is the unit disk \mathbb{D} the theory of boundary values for functions in these spaces is analogous to the classical one.
