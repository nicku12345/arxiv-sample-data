Let M = \tilde{M}/\Gamma be a Kahler manifold, where \tilde{M} is the universal Kahler cover, and where \Gamma is the deck transformation group. Let (L, h) \to M be a positive Hermitian holomorophic line bundle. Lift the Hermitian line bundle to \tilde{M} and consider the relation between the orthogonal projection onto holomorphic sections on the quotient and onto L^2 holomorphic sections on \tilde{M}. We prove that the quotient Szego kernel is given by the periodization of the L^2 Szego kernel of the universal cover, i.e. its sum over the deck group \Gamma. Although this is a standard result for symmetric spaces (it is used in the Selberg trace formula) and is also standard for heat and wave kernels, it seems that a proof of the sum over Gamma formula was lacking for Szego kernels of positive line bundles over general Kahler manifolds.   We apply the result to give a simple proof of Napier's theorem on the holomorphic convexity of \tilde{M} with respect to \tilde{L}^N and to surjectivity of Poincar\'e series. We also simplify the discussion of Poincare series in Kollar's book.
