Let \omega be a non-negative function on \mathbb{R}. We are looking for a non-zero f from a given space of entire functions X satisfying (a) \quad|f|\leq \omega\text{\quad or\quad(b)}\quad |f|\asymp\omega. The classical Beurling--Malliavin Multiplier Theorem corresponds to (a) and the classical Paley--Wiener space as X. We survey recent results for the case when X is a de Branges space \he. Numerous answers mainly depend on the behaviour of the phase function of the generating function E.
