This paper is devoted to studying of some properties of multivalued mappings in Euclidean space. There were proved theorems on a fixed point for multivalued mappings whose restrictions to some subset in the closure of a domain satisfy "a coacute angle condition" or "a strict coacute angle condition". There also were obtained similar results for restrictions of multivalued mappings satisfying some metric limitations.
