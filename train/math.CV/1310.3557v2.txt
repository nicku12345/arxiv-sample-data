Let (X,\omega) be a compact K\"{a}hler manifold. Let (L,h) be a hermitian holomorphic line bundle over X, such that \Theta_{L,h}\geq -\varepsilon\omega for a small \varepsilon>0, E be a holomorphic line bundle over X. For k\in \mathbb{N}_+, denote by X_k:=(X,\omega^k) the K\"{a}hler manifold X with new scaled metric \omega^k=k\omega. Estimates of the number of eigenvalues smaller than \lambda of the \debar-Laplacian on forms on X_k with values in L^k\otimes E are presented for 0\leq \lambda<k. In particular, when \lambda=0, we get a numeric bound for the cohomology groups.
