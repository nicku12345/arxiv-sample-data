We show that a family {\cal F} of meromorphic functions in a domain D satisfying \frac{|f^{(k)}|}{1+|f^{(j)}|^\alpha}(z)\ge C \qquad \mbox{for all} z\in D \mbox{and all} f\in {\cal F} (where k and j are integers with k>j\ge 0 and C>0, \alpha>1 are real numbers) is quasi-normal. Furthermore, if all functions in {\cal F} are holomorphic, the order of quasi-normality of {\cal F} is at most j-1. The proof relies on the Zalcman rescaling method and previous results on differential inequalities constituting normality.
