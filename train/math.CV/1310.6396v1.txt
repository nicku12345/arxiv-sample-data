The individual terms of the series representing the Riemann zeta function are examined geometrically from their accumulated plot in the complex plane. Symmetry is identified and determined mathematically for comparison with more traditional results of analytic number theory. A new interpretation of analytic continuation allows a construction, based on the limacon, which shows the conditions under which zeros can occur. The special importance of prime steps in the decrease of the real part from 1 to 0 when zeta equals zero is shown. Discussion of bounds and extension to generalized zeta functions are included.
