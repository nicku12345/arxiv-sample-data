Let f=B_1/B_2 be a ratio of finite Blaschke products having no critical points on \partial\mathbb{D}. Then f has finitely many critical level curves (level curves containing critical points of f) in the disk, and the non-critical level curves interpolate smoothly between the critical level curves. Thus, to understand the geometry of all the level curves of f, one needs only understand the finitely many critical level curves of f. In this paper, we show that in fact such a function f is determined not just geometrically but conformally by the configuration of critical level curves. That is, if f_1 and f_2 have the same configuration of critical level curves, then there is a conformal map \phi such that f_1\equiv f_2\circ\phi. We then show that every configuration of critical level curves which could come from an analytic function is instantiated by a polynomial. We also include a new proof of a theorem of B\^{o}cher (which is an extension of the Gauss--Lucas theorem to rational functions) using level curves.
