In this paper we investigate invariant domains in \, \Xi^+, a distinguished \,G-invariant, Stein domain in the complexification of an irreducible Hermitian symmetric space \,G/K. The domain \,\Xi^+, recently introduced by Kr\"otz and Opdam, contains the crown domain \,\Xi\, and it is maximal with respect to properness of the \,G-action. In the tube case, it also contains \,S^+, an invariant Stein domain arising from the compactly causal structure of a symmetric orbit in the boundary of \,\Xi. We prove that the envelope of holomorphy of an invariant domain in \,\Xi^+, which is contained neither in \,\Xi\, nor in \,S^+, is univalent and coincides with \,\Xi^+. This fact, together with known results concerning \,\Xi\, and \,S^+, proves the univalence of the envelope of holomorphy of an arbitrary invariant domain in \,\Xi^+\, and completes the classification of invariant Stein domains therein.
