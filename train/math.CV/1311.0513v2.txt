The main purpose of this paper is to introduce and study the notion of plurifinely-maximal plurifinely plurisubharmonic functions, which extends the notion of maximal plurisubharmonic functions on a Euclidean domain to a plurifine domain of C^n in a natural way. Our main result is that a finite plurifinely plurisubharmonic function u on a plurifine domain U satisfies (dd^c u)^n=0 if and only if u is plurifinely-locally plurifinely-maximal outside some pluripolar set. In particular, a finite plurifinely-maximal plurisubharmonic function u satisfies (dd^c u)^n=0.
