We describe the region \mathcal{V}(z_0) of values of f(z_0) for all normalized bounded univalent functions f in the unit disk \mathbb{D} at a fixed point z_0 \in \mathbb{D}. The proof is based on identifying \mathcal{V}(z_0) as the reachable set of the radial Loewner differential equation. We also prove an analogous result for the upper half-plane using the chordal Loewner equation.
