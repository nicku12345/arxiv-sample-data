We prove that every reduced Stein space admits a holomorphic function without critical points. Furthermore, any closed discrete subset of such a space is the critical locus of a holomorphic function. We also show that for every complex analytic stratification with nonsingular strata on a reduced Stein space there exists a holomorphic function whose restriction to every stratum is noncritical. These result also provide some information on critical loci of holomorphic functions on desingularizations of Stein spaces. In particular, every 1-convex manifold admits a holomorphic function that is noncritical outside the exceptional variety.
