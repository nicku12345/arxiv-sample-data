In this paper, we prove a type of partial rigidity result for proper holomorphic mappings of certain \ell-concave domains in projective space into model quadratic \ell-concave domains. The main technical result is a degree estimate for proper holomorphic mappings into the model domains, provided that the mappings extend to projective space as rational mappings, and the source domain contains algebraic varieties and has a boundary with low CR complexity.
