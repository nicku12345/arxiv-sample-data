We introduce a weaker variant of the concept of three point property, which is equivalent to a non-linear local connectivity condition introduced in [12], sufficient to guarantee the extendability of a conformal map f from the unit disk onto a domain to the entire plane as a homeomorphism of locally exponentially integrable distortion. Sufficient conditions for extendability to a homeomorphism of locally p-integrable distortion are also given.
