The radial Komatu-Loewner equation is a differential equation for certain normalized conformal mappings that can be used to describe the growth of slits within multiply connected domains. We show that it is possible to choose constant coefficients in this equation in order to generate given disjoint slits and that those coefficients are uniquely determined under a suitable normalization of the differential equation.
