Let M be a pseudoconvex, oriented, bounded and closed CR submanifold of \mathbb{C}^{n} of hypersurface type. Our main result says that when a certain 1-form on M is exact on the null space of the Levi form, then the complex Green operator on M satisfies Sobolev estimates. This happens in particular when M admits a set of plurisubharmonic defining functions or when M is strictly pseudoconvex except for the points on a simply connected complex submanifold.
