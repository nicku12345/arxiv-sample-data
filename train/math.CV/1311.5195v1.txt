A connected real analytic hypersurface M in C^(n+1) whose Levi form is nondegenerate in at least one point - hence at every point of some Zariski-open subset - is locally biholomorphic to the model Heisenberg quadric pseudosphere of signature (k, n-k) in one point if and only if, at every other Levi nondegenerate point, it is also locally biholomorphic to some Heisenberg pseudosphere, possibly having different signature (l, n-l).
