In this paper we study the structure of complex points of codimension 2 real submanifolds in complex n dimensional manifolds. We show that the local structure of a complex point up to isotopy only depends on their type (either elliptic or hyperbolic). We also show that any such submanifold can be smoothly isotoped into a submanifold that has 2-strictly pseudoconvex neighborhood basis.
