Laguerre's theorem regarding the number of non-real zeros of a polynomial and its image under certain linear operators is generalized. This generalization is then used to (1) exhibit a number of previously undiscovered complex zero decreasing sequences for the Chebyshev, Legendre, and generalized Laguerre polynomial bases and (2) simultaneously generate a basis B and a corresponding B-CZDS. Some extensions to transcendental entire functions in the Laguerre-Polya class are given which, in turn, give a new and short proof of a previously known result due to one of the authors. The paper concludes with several open questions.
