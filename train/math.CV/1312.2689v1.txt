Let A_\zeta=\Omega-\overline{\rho(\zeta)\cdot\Omega} be a family of generalized annuli over a domain U. We show that the logarithm \log K_{\zeta}(z) of the Bergman kernel K_{\zeta}(z) of A_\zeta is plurisubharmonic provided \rho\in PSH(U). It is remarkable that A_\zeta is non-pseudoconvex when the dimension of A_\zeta is larger than one. For standard annuli in {\mathbb C}, we obtain an interesting formula for \partial^2 \log K_{\zeta}/\partial \zeta\partial\bar{\zeta}, as well as its boundary behavior.
