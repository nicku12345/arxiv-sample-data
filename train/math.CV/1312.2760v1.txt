In this note, we consider the linear topological invariant {\Omega}-tilda for Fr\'echet spaces of global analytic functions on Stein manifolds. We show that O(M), for a Stein manifold M, enjoys the property {\Omega}-tilda if and only if every compact subset of M lies in a relatively compact sublevel set of a bounded plurisubharmonic function defined on M. We also look at some immediate implications of this characterization.
