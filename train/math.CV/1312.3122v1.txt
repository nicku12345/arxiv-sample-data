In this paper, we establish a Bloch-type growth theorem for generalized Bloch-type spaces and discuss relationships between Dirichlet-type spaces and Hardy-type spaces on certain classes of complex-valued functions. Then we present some applications to non-homogeneous Yukawa PDEs. We also consider some properties of the Lipschitz-type spaces on certain classes of complex-valued functions. Finally, we will study a class of composition operators on these spaces.
