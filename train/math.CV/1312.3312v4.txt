We study the growth of the quantity \int_{\mathbb{T}}|R'(z)|\,dm(z) for rational functions R of degree n, which are bounded and univalent in the unit disk, and prove that this quantity may grow as n^\gamma, \gamma>0, when n\to\infty. Some applications of this result to problems of regularity of boundaries of Nevanlinna domains are considered. We also discuss a related result by Dolzhenko which applies to general (non-univalent) rational functions.
