Let M be an n-dimensional complex manifold. A holomorphic function f:M\to \mathbb C is said to be semi-Bloch if for every \lambda\in \mathbb C the function g_\lambda=\exp(\lambda f(z)) is normal on M. We characterise Semi-Bloch functions on infinitesimally Kobayashi non-degenerate M in geometric as well as analytic terms. Moreover, we show that on such manifolds, semi-Bloch functions are normal.
