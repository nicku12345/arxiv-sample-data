We prove estimates for solutions of the \bar \partial u=\omega  equation in a strictly pseudo convex domain  \Omega  in {\mathbb{C}}^{n}. For instance if the  (p,q) current \omega  has its coefficients in L^{r}(\Omega ) with 1\leq r<2(n+1) then there is a solution u in L^{s}(\Omega ) with \ \frac{1}{s}=\frac{1}{r}-\frac{1}{2(n+1)}. We also have BMO and Lipschitz estimates for r\geq 2(n+1). These results were already done by S. Krantz in the case of (0,1) forms and just for the L^{r}-L^{s} part by L. Ma and S. Vassiliadou for general (p,q) forms. To get the complete result we propose another approach, based on Carleson measures of order \alpha  and on the subordination lemma.
