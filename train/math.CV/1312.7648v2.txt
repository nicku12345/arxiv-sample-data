In order to get estimates on the solutions of the equation \bar \partial u=\omega  on Stein manifold, we introduce a new method the "raising steps method", to get global results from local ones. In particular it allows us to transfer results form open sets in {\mathbb{C}}^{n} to open sets in a Stein manifold.\ \par Using it we get \displaystyle L^{r}-L^{s} results for solutions of equation \bar \partial u=\omega  with a gain, \displaystyle s>r, in strictly pseudo convex domains in Stein manifolds.\ \par We also get \displaystyle L^{r}-L^{s} results for domains in {\mathbb{C}}^{n} locally biholomorphic to convex domains of finite type.
