Let \ast and \widetilde {\ast} denote the convolution of two analytic maps and that of an analytic map and a harmonic map respectively. Pokhrel [1] proved that if f = h+\overline{g} is a harmonic map convex in the direction of e^{i\gamma} and \phi is an analytic map in the class DCP, then f\widetilde{\ast} \phi= h\widetilde{\ast}\phi + \overline{g\widetilde{\ast}\phi} is also convex in the direction of e^{i\gamma}, provided f\widetilde{\ast}\phi is locally univalent and sense-preserving. In the present paper we obtain a general condition under which f\widetilde{\ast} \phi is locally univalent and sense-preserving. Some interesting applications of the general result are also presented.
