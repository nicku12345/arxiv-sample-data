Let \theta be an inner function satisfying the connected level set condition of B. Cohn, and let K^{1}_{\theta} be the shift-coinvariant subspace of the Hardy space H^1 generated by \theta. We describe the dual space to K^{1}_{\theta} in terms of a bounded mean oscillation with respect to the Clark measure \sigma_\alpha of \theta. Namely, we prove that (K^{1}_{\theta} \cap zH^1)^* = {\rm BMO}(\sigma_\alpha). The result implies a two-sided estimate for the operator norm of a finite Hankel matrix of size n\times n via {\rm BMO}(\mu_{2n})-norm of its standard symbol, where \mu_{2n} is the Haar measure on the group \{\xi \in \mathbb{C}: \xi^{2n} = 1\}.
