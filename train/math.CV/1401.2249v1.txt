We study extensions of Wermer's maximality theorem to several complex variables. We exhibit various smoothly embedded manifolds in complex Euclidean space whose hulls are non-trivial but contain no analytic disks. We answer a question posed by Lee Stout concerning the existence of analytic structure for a uniform algebra whose maximal ideal space is a manifold.
