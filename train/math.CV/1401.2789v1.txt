A special class of autonomous algebraic differential equations is studied. No equations in the class have any entire transcendental solutions. In a sense, for almost all equations in the class, transcendental meromorphic solutions can also be excluded. With substantially fewer exceptional equations, transcendental solutions are either elliptic or of the form f(z) = g(exp(cz)) with g rational and c constant.
