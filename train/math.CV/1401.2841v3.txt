We construct Fatou-Bieberbach domains in \mathbb C^n for n>1 which contain a given compact set K and at the same time avoid a totally real affine subspace L of dimension <n, provided that K\cup L is polynomially convex. By using this result, we show that the domain \mathbb C^n\setminus\mathbb R^k for 1\le k<n enjoys the Oka property with approximation for maps from any Stein manifold of dimension <n.
