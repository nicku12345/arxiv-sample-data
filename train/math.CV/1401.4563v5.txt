In the present paper, we devise a version of topological L^2-Serre duality for singular complex spaces with arbitrary singularities. This duality is used to deduce various new L^2-vanishing theorems for the \bar{\partial}-equation on singular spaces. It is shown that complex spaces with rational singularities behave quite tame with respect to the \bar{\partial}-equation in the L^2-sense. More precisely: a singular point is rational if and only if the L^2-\bar{\partial}-complex is exact in this point. So, we obtain an L^2-\bar{\partial}-resolution of the structure sheaf in rational singular points.
