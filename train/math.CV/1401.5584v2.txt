Tropical Nevanlinna theory, introduced by Halburd and Southall as a tool to analyze integrability of ultra-discrete equations, studies the growth and complexity of continuous piecewise linear real functions. The purpose of this paper is to extend tropical Nevanlinna theory to n-dimensional tropical projective spaces by introducing a natural characteristic function for tropical holomorphic curves, and by proving a tropical analogue of Cartan's second main theorem. It is also shown that in the 1-dimensional case this result implies a known tropical second main theorem due to Laine and Tohge.
