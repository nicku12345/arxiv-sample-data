Since the nonlinear integral transforms J_{\alpha}[f](z) = \int_{0}^{z}(f'(u))^{\alpha} du and I_{\alpha}[f](z) =\int_0^z (f(u)/u)^{\alpha} du with a complex number \alpha have been introduced, a great number of studies were dedicated to deriving sufficient conditions for univalence on the unit disk. On the other hand, little is known about the conditions that J_{\alpha}[f] or I_{\alpha}[f] produces a holomorphic univalent function in the unit disk which extends to a quasiconformal map on the complex plane. In this paper we discuss quasiconformal extendibility of the integral transforms J_{\alpha}[f] and I_{\alpha}[f] for holomorphic functions which satisfy the Noshiro-Warschawski criterion. Various approaches using pre-Schwarzian derivatives, differential subordinations and Loewner theory are taken to this problem.
