The authors consider the class \F of normalized functions f analytic in the unit disk \ID and satisfying the condition {\rm Re}\left(1+\frac{zf''(z)}{f'(z)}\right)>-\frac{1}{2},\quad z\in\D.  Recently, Ponnusamy et al. \cite{samy-hiroshi-swadesh} have shown that 1/6 is the uniform sharp bound for the radius of convexity of every section of each function in the class \F. They conjectured that 1/3 is the uniform univalence radius of every section of f\in \F. In this paper, we solve this conjecture affirmatively.
