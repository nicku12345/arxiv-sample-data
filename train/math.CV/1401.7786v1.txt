The universal cover or the covering group of a hyperbolic Riemann surface X is important but hard to express explicitly. It can be, however, detected by the uniformisation and a suitable description of X. Beardon proposed five different ways to describe twice-punctured disks using fundamental domain, hyperbolic length, collar and extremal length in 2012. We parameterize a once-punctured annulus A in terms of five parameter pairs and give explicit formulas about the hyperbolic structure and the complex structure of A. Several degenerating cases are also treated.
