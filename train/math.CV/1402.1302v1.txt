Given a Gaussian analytic function f_L of intesity L in the unit ball of \mathbb C^n, n\geq 2, consider its (random) zero variety Z(f_L). We study the variance of the (n-1)-dimensional volume of Z(f_L) inside a pseudo-hyperbolic ball of radius r. We first express this variance as an integral of a positive function in the unit disk. Then we study its asymptotic behaviour as L\to\infty and as r\to 1^{-}. Both the results and the proofs generalise to the ball those given by Jeremiah Buckley for the unit disk.
