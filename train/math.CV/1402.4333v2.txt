For a real number \alpha the Hilbert spaces \mathscr{D}_\alpha consists of those Dirichlet series \sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n/n^s for which \sum_{n=1}^\infty |a_n|^2/[d(n)]^\alpha < \infty, where d(n) denotes the number of divisors of n. We extend a theorem of Seip on the bounded zero sequences of functions in \mathscr{D}_\alpha to the case \alpha>0. Generalizations to other weighted spaces of Dirichlet series are also discussed, as are partial results on the zeros of functions in the Hardy spaces of Dirichlet series \mathscr{H}^p, for 1\leq p <2.
