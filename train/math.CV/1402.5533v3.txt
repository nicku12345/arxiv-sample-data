In this article, we prove that there are at most two meromorphic mappings of \mathbb C^m into \mathbb P^n(\mathbb C)\ (n\geqslant 2) sharing 2n+2 hyperplanes in general position regardless of multiplicity, where all zeros with multiplicities more than certain values do not need to be counted. We also show that if three meromorphic mappings f^1,f^2,f^3 of \mathbb C^m into \mathbb P^n(\mathbb C)\ (n\geqslant 5) share 2n+1 hyperplanes in general position with truncated multiplicity then the map f^1\times f^2\times f^3 is linearly degenerate.
