In this paper we develop a variational method for the Loewner equation in higher dimensions. As a result we obtain a version of Pontryagin's maximum principle from optimal control theory for the Loewner equation in several complex variables. Based on recent work of Arosio, Bracci and Wold we then apply our version of the Pontryagin maximum principle to obtain first--order necessary conditions for the extremal functions for a wide class of extremal problems over the set of normalized biholomorphic mappings on the unit ball in \mathbb{C}^n.
