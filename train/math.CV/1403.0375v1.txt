The aim of this paper is to extend the domain of definition of (dd^c\centerdot)^q\wedge T on some classes of plurisubharmonic (psh) functions, which are not necessary bounded, where T is a positive closed current of bidimension (q,q) on an open set \Omega of \Bbb C^n. We introduce two classes \mathcal{F}_{p}^{T}(\Omega) and \mathcal{E}_p^T(\Omega) and we show that they belong to the domain of definition of the operator (dd^c\centerdot)^q\wedge T. We also prove that all functions belong to these classes are C_T-quasicontinuous and that the comparison principle is valid in them.
