We describe the basic complex geometry and function theory of the {\em pentablock} \mathcal{P}, which is the bounded domain in \mathbb{C}^3 given by \[ \mathcal{P}= \{(a_{21}, \mathrm{tr} A, \det A): A= \begin{bmatrix} a_{ij}\end{bmatrix}_{i,j=1}^2 \in \mathbb{B}\} \] where \mathbb{B} denotes the open unit ball in the space of 2\times 2 complex matrices. We prove several characterizations of the domain. We describe its distinguished boundary and exhibit a 4-parameter group of automorphisms of \mathcal{P}. We show that \mathcal{P} is intimately connected with the problem of \mu-synthesis for a certain cost function \mu on the space of 2\times 2 matrices defined in connection with robust stabilization by control engineers. We demonstrate connections between the function theories of \mathcal{P} and \mathbb{B}. We show that \mathcal{P} is polynomially convex and starlike.
