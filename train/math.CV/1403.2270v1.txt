Let P(z) be a polynomial of degree n having no zero in |z|<k where k\geq 1, then for every real or complex number \alpha with |\alpha|\geq 1 it is known \begin{equation*} \underset{|z|=1}{\max}|D_\alpha P(z)|\leq n\left(\dfrac{|\alpha|+k}{1+k}\right)\underset{|z|=1}{\max}|P(z)|, \end{equation*} where D_\alpha P(z)=nP(z)+(\alpha-z)P^{\prime}(z) denote the polar derivative of the polynomial P(z) of degree n with respect to a point \alpha\in\mathbb{C}. In this paper, by a simple method, a refinement of above inequality and other related results are obtained.
