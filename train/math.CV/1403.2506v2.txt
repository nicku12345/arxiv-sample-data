We study Poletsky-Stessin Hardy spaces on complex ellipsoids in C^n. Different from one variable case, classical Hardy spaces are strictly contained in Poletsky-Stessin Hardy spaces on complex ellipsoids so boundary values are not automatically obtained in this case. We have showed that functions belonging to Poletsky-Stessin Hardy spaces have boundary values and they can be approached through admissible approach regions in the complex ellipsoid case. Moreover, we have obtained that polynomials are dense in these spaces. We also considered the composition operators acting on Poletsky-Stessin Hardy spaces on complex ellipsoids and gave conditions for their boundedness and compactness.
