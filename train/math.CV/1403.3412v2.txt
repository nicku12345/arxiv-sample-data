In this note we show that the weighted L^{2}-Sobolev estimates obtained by P. Charpentier, Y. Dupain & M. Mounkaila for the weighted Bergman projection of the Hilbert space L^{2}\left(\Omega,d\mu_{0}\right) where \Omega is a smoothly bounded pseudoconvex domain of finite type in \mathbb{C}^{n} and \mu_{0}=\left(-\rho_{0}\right)^{r}d\lambda, \lambda being the Lebesgue measure, r\in\mathbb{Q}_{+} and \rho_{0} a special defining function of \Omega, are still valid for the Bergman projection of L^{2}\left(\Omega,d\mu\right) where \mu=\left(-\rho\right)^{r}d\lambda, \rho being any defining function of \Omega. In fact a stronger directional Sobolev estimate is established. Moreover similar generalizations are obtained for weighted L^{p}-Sobolev and lipschitz estimates in the case of pseudoconvex domain of finite type in \mathbb{C}^{2} and for some convex domains of finite type.
