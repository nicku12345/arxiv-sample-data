We consider the Dirichlet problem for the complex Monge-Amp\`ere equation in a bounded strongly hyperconvex Lipschitz domain in \C^n. We first give a sharp estimate on the modulus of continuity of the solution when the boundary data is continuous and the right hand side has a continuous density. Then we consider the case when the boundary value function is C^{1,1} and the right hand side has a density in L^p(\Omega) for some p>1 and prove the H\"older continuity of the solution.
