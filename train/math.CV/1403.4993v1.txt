A flag domain D is an open orbit of a real form G_0 in a flag manifold Z=G/P of its complexification. If D is holomorphically convex, then, since it is a product of a Hermitian symmetric space of bounded type and a compact flag manifold, {Aut}(D) is easily described. If D is not holomorphically convex, then in our previous work (American J. Math, 136, Nr.2 (2013) 291-310 (arXiv: 1003.5974)) it was shown that {Aut}(D) is a Lie group whose connected component at the identity agrees with G_0 except possibly in situations which arise in Onishchik's list of flag manifolds where {Aut}(Z)^0 is larger than G. These exceptions are handled in detail here. In addition substantially simpler proofs of some of our previous work are given.
