Let X be an open Riemann surface. We prove an Oka property on the approximation and interpolation of continuous maps X \to (\mathbb{C}^*)^2 by proper holomorphic embeddings, provided that we permit a smooth deformation of the complex structure on X outside a certain set. This generalises and strengthens a recent result of Alarcon and Lopez. We also give a Forstneric-Wold theorem for proper holomorphic embeddings (with respect to the given complex structure) of certain open Riemann surfaces into (\mathbb{C}^*)^2.
