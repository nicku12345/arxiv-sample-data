In this paper, we continue our investigation of polyharmonic mappings in the complex plane. First, we establish two Landau type theorems. We also show a three circles type theorem and an area version of the Schwarz lemma. Finally, we study Lipschitz continuity of polyharmonic mappings with respect to the distance ratio metric.
