We prove the non-hyperbolicity of the Kobayashi distance for \mathcal{C}^{1,1}-smooth convex domains in \mathbb{C}^{2} which contain an analytic disc in the boundary or have a point of infinite type with rotation symmetry. Moreover, examples of smooth, non pseudoconvex, Gromov hyperbolic domains are given; we prove that the symmetrized polydisc and the tetrablock are not Gromov hyperbolic and write down some results about Gromov hyperbolicity of product spaces.
