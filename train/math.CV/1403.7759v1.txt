Explicit expressions for the hypergeometric series {}_2F_1(-n, a; 2a\pm j;2) and {}_2F_1(-n, a; -2n\pm j;2) for positive integer n and arbitrary integer j are obtained with the help of generalizations of Kummer's second and third summation theorems obtained earlier by Rakha and Rathie. Results for |j|\leq 5 derived previously using different methods are also obtained as special cases.
