It is known that automorphisms of quasi-circular domains fixing the origin are polynomial mappings. By introducing the so-called resonance order and quasi-resonance order, we provide a uniform upper bound for the degree of such polynomial automorphisms. As a particular consequence of our result, we obtain a generalization of the classical Cartan's theorem for circular domains to the quasi-circular case.
