In this article, we show some uniqueness theorems for meromorphic mappings of \C^n into the complex projective space \pnc sharing different families of moving hyperplanes regardless of multiplicites, where all intersecting points between these mappings and moving hyperplanes with multiplicities more than a certain number do not need to be counted.
