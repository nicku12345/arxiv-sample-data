In this paper we derive integral identities involving both the unit sphere and the unit disk or subsets thereof. In addition these identities lead to a prototype of the Funk-Hecke formula for subspheres embedded in \Omega_{2q}. The technique requires the use of the complex Funk-Hecke formula, where eigenvalues of the integral operator generated by a bizonal kernel on the unit sphere \Omega_{2q} of \mathbb{C}^q are given by an integral on the closed unit disk B_q of \mathbb{C}^{q-1}.
