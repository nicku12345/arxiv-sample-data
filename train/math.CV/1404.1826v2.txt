Let L_H denote the set of all normalized locally one-to-one and sense-preserving harmonic functions in the unit disc \Delta. It is well-known that every complex-valued harmonic function in the unit disc \Delta can be uniquely represented as f = h + \overline{g}, where h and g are analytic in \Delta. In particular the decomposition formula holds true for functions of the class L_H. For a fixed analytic function h, an interesting problem arises - to describe all functions g, such that f belongs to L_H.   The case when f\in L_H and h is the identity mapping was considered [2]. More general results are given in [3], where f\in L_H and letting h to be a convex analytic mapping. The focus of our present research is to characterize the set of all functions f\in L_H having starlike analytic part h. In this paper, we provide coefficient, distortion and growth estimates of g. We also give growth and Jacobian estimates of f.
