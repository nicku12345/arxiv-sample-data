For every q\in(0,1) and 0\le \alpha<1 we define a class of analytic functions, the so-called q-starlike functions of order \alpha, on the open unit disk. We study this class of functions and explore some inclusion properties with the well-known class of starlike functions of order \alpha. The paper is also devoted to the discussion on the Herglotz representation formula for analytic functions zf'(z)/f(z) when f(z) is q-starlike of order \alpha. As an application we also discuss the Bieberbach conjecture problem for the q-starlike functions of order \alpha. Further application includes the study of the order of q-starlikeness of the well-known basic hypergeometric functions introduced by Heine.
