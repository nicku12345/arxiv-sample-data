In this paper, we first establish the Schwarz-Pick lemma of higher-order and apply it to obtain a univalency criteria for planar harmonic mappings. Then we discuss distortion theorems, Lipschitz continuity and univalency of planar harmonic mappings defined in the unit disk with linearly connected images.
