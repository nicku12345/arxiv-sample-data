We give an answer to the abstract Capelli problem: Let (G, V) be a multiplicity-free finite-dimensional representation of a connected reductive complex Lie group G and G' be its derived subgroup. Assume that the categorical quotient V//G is one dimensional, i.e., there exists a polynomial f generating the algebra of G'-invariant polynomials on V (\mathbb{C}[V]^{G'} = \mathbb{C}[f]) and that f \not\in \mathbb{C}[V]^{G}. We prove that the category of regular holonomic \mathcal{D}_{V}-modules invariant under the action of G is equivalent to the category of graded modules of finite type over a suitable algebra \mathcal{A}.
