It is known that a real analytic CR function f on a real analytic, generic submanifold M in C^N can be holomorphically extended. A stronger result on a finite type, real analytic, generic submanifold M is found in which we assume f a continuous CR function with real analytic imaginary part Im(f). The idea is contained in a general Schwarz Reflection Principle in one complex variable.
