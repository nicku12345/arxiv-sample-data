The present paper is devoted to the study of classes of mappings with non-bounded characteristic of quasiconformality. It is obtained a result on normal families of the open discrete mappings f:D\rightarrow {\Bbb C}\setminus\{a, b\} of the class W_{loc}^{1, 1} having a finite distortion and omitting two fixed values a\ne b in {\Bbb C}, maximal dilatations of which has a majorant of the class of finite mean oscillation at every point. In particular, the result mentioned above holds for the so-called Q-mappings and is an analog of known Montel theorem for analytic functions.
