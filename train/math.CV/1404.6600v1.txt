Let D_\alpha P(z)=nP(z)+(\alpha-z)P^{\prime}(z) denote the polar derivative of a polynomial P(z) of degree n with respect to a point \alpha\in\mathbb{C}. In this paper, we present a correct proof, independent of Laguerre's theorem, of an inequality concerning the polar derivative of a polynomial with restricted zeros recently formulated by K. K. Dewan, Naresh Singh, Abdullah Mir, [Extensions of some polynomial inequalities to the polar derivative, \emph{J. Math. Anal. Appl.,} \textbf{352} (2009) 807-815].
