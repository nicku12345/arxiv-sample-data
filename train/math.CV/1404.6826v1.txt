A semiholomorphic foliations of type (n, d) is a differentiable real manifold X of dimension 2n + d, foliated by complex leaves of complex dimension n. In the present work, we introduce an appropriate notion of pseudoconvexity (and consequently, q-completeness) for such spaces, given by the interplay of the usual pseudoconvexity, along the leaves, and the positivity of the transversal bundle. For 1-complete real analytic semiholomorphic foliations, we obtain a vanishing theorem for the CR cohomology, which we use to show an extension result for CR functions on Levi flat hypersurfaces and an embedding theorem in C^N . In the compact case, we introduce a notion of weak positivity for the transversal bundle, which allows us to construct a real analytic embedding in CP^N .
