Most characterizations of interpolating sequences for Bergman spaces include the condition that the sequence be uniformly discrete in the hyperbolic metric. We show that if the notion of interpolation is suitably generalized, two of these characterizations remain valid without that condition. The general interpolation we consider here includes the usual simple interpolation and multiple interpolation as special cases.
