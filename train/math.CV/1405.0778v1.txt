We study the holomorphic embedding problem from a compact strongly pseudoconvex real algebraic hypersurface into a sphere of higher dimension. We construct a family of compact strongly pseudoconvex hypersurfaces M_{\epsilon} in \mathbb{C}^2, and prove that for any integer N, there is a number \epsilon(N) with 0<\epsilon(N)<1 such that for any \epsilon with 0<\epsilon<\epsilon(N), M_\epsilon can not be locally holomorphically embedded into the unit sphere \mathbb{S}^{2N-1} in \mathbb{C}^N.
