Consider polynomial sequences that satisfy a first-order differential recurrence. We prove that if the recurrence is of a special form, then the Tur\'an expressions for the sequence are weakly Hurwitz stable (non-zero in the open right half-plane). A special case of our theorem settles a problem proposed by S. Fisk that the Tur\'an expressions for the univariate Bell polynomials are weakly Hurwitz stable. We obtain related results for Chebyshev and Hermite polynomials, and propose several extensions involving Laguerre polynomials, Bessel polynomials, and Jensen polynomials associated to a class of real entire functions.
