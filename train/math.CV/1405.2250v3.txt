We show that every strictly pseudoconvex domain \Omega with smooth boundary in a complex manifold \mathcal{M} admits a global defining function, i.e., a smooth plurisubharmonic function \varphi \colon U \to \mathbb R defined on an open neighbourhood U \subset \mathcal{M} of \overline{\Omega} such that \Omega = \{\varphi < 0\}, d\varphi \neq 0 on b\Omega and \varphi is strictly plurisubharmonic near b\Omega. We then introduce the notion of the core \mathfrak{c}(\Omega) of an arbitrary domain \Omega \subset \mathcal{M} as the set of all points where every smooth and bounded from above plurisubharmonic function on \Omega fails to be strictly plurisubharmonic. If \Omega is not relatively compact in \mathcal{M}, then in general \mathfrak{c}(\Omega) is nonempty, even in the case when \mathcal{M} is Stein. It is shown that every strictly pseudoconvex domain \Omega \subset \mathcal{M} with smooth boundary admits a global defining function that is strictly plurisubharmonic precisely in the complement of \mathfrak{c}(\Omega). We then investigate properties of the core. Among other results we prove 1-pseudoconcavity of the core, we show that in general the core does not possess an analytic structure, and we investigate Liouville type properties of the core.
