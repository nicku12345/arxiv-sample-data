We give a generalization of the Komatu-Loewner equation to multiple slits. Therefore, we consider an n-connected circular slit disk \Omega as our initial domain minus m\in \mathbb{N} disjoint, simple and continuous curves that grow from the outer boundary \partial \mathbb{D} of \Omega into the interior. Consequently we get a decreasing family (\Omega_t)_{t\in[0,T]} of domains with \Omega_0=\Omega. We will prove that the corresponding Riemann mapping functions g_t from \Omega_t onto a circular slit disk, which are normalized by g_t(0)=0 and g_t'(0)>0, satisfy a Loewner equation known as the Komatu-Loewner equation.
