Funk-Hecke's formula allows a passage from plane waves to radially invariant functions. It may be adapted to transform axial monogenics into biaxial monogenics that are monogenic functions invariant under the product group SO(p)xSO(q). Fueter's theorem transforms holomorphic functions in the plane into axial monogenics, so that by combining both results, we obtain a method to construct biaxial monogenics from holomorphic functions.
