Complex supermanifold structures being deformations of the exterior algebra of a holomorphic vector bundle, have been parametrized by orbits of a group on non-abelian cohomology by P. Green. For the case of odd dimension 4 and 5 an identification of these cohomologies with a subset of abelian cohomologies being computable with less effort, is provided in this article. Furthermore for a rank \leq 3 sub vector bundle F\to M of a holomorphic vector bundle E=F\oplus F^\prime\to M, a reduction of a (possibly non-split) supermanifold structure associated with \Lambda E to a structure associated with \Lambda F is defined. In the case of rk(F^\prime)\leq 2 with no global derivations increasing the \mathbb Z-degree by 2, the complete cohomological information of a supermanifold structure associated with E is given in terms of cohomologies compatible with the decomposition of E. Details on supermanifold structures of odd dimension 3 and 4 associated with sums of line bundles of sufficient negativity on \mathbb P^1(\mathbb C) are deduced.
