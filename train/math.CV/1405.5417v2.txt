Given any \varepsilon>0, we construct an orthonormal system of n_k uniformly bounded polynomials of degree at most k on the unit sphere in \mathbb R^{m+1} where n_k is bigger than 1-\varepsilon times the dimension of the space of polynomials of degree at most k. Similarly we construct an orthonormal system of sections of powers L^k of a positive holomorphic line bundle on a compact K\"ahler manifold with cardinality bigger than 1-\varepsilon times the dimension of the space of global holomorphic sections to L^k.
