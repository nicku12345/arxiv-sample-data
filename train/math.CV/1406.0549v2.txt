We give a description (direct formulas) of all complex geodesics in a convex tube domain in \CC^n containing no complex affine lines, expressed in terms of geometric properties of the domain. We next apply that result to give formulas (a necessary condition) for extremal mappings with respect to the Lempert function and the Kobayashi-Royden metric in a big class of bounded, pseudoconvex, complete Reinhardt domains: for all of them in \CC^2 and for those of them in \CC^n which logarithmic image is strictly convex in geometric sense.
