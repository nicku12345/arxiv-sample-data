We study hyperbolic Gaussian analytic functions in the unit polydisk of \mathbb C^n. Following the scheme previously used in the unit ball we first study the asymptotics of fluctuations of linear statistics as the directional intensities L_j, j=1,\dots,n tend to \infty. Then we estimate the probability of large deviations of such linear statistics and use the estimate to prove a hole theorem. Our proofs are inspired by the methods of M. Sodin and B. Tsirelson for the one-dimensional case, and B. Shiffman and S. Zelditch for the study of the analogous problem for compact K\"ahler manifolds.
