We prove two density theorems for quadrature domains in \mathbb{C}^n, n \geq 2. It is shown that quadrature domains are dense in the class of all product domains of the form D \times \Omega, where D \subset \mathbb{C}^{n-1} is a smoothly bounded domain satisfying Bell's Condition R and \Omega \subset \mathbb{C} is a smoothly bounded domain and also in the class of all smoothly bounded complete Hartogs domains in \mathbb{C}^2.
