It has been known since the work of A.A. Kirillov that any smooth Jordan curve in the plane can be represented by its so-called fingerprint, an orientation preserving smooth diffeomorphism of the unit circle onto itself. In this paper, we give a new, simple proof of a theorem of Ebenfelt, Khavinson and Shapiro stating that the fingerprint of a polynomial lemniscate of degree n is given by the n-th root of a Blaschke product of degree n and that conversely, any smooth diffeomorphism induced by such a map is the fingerprint of a polynomial lemniscate of the same degree. The proof is easily generalized to the case of rational lemniscates, thus solving a problem raised by the previously mentioned authors.
