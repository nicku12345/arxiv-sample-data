Using the notions and tools from realization in the sense of systems theory, we establish an explicit and new realization formula for families of infinite products of rational matrix-functions of a single complex variable. Our realizations of these resulting infinite products have the following four features: 1) Our infinite product realizations are functions defined in an infinite-dimensional complex domain. 2) Starting with a realization of a single rational matrix-function M, we show that a resulting infinite product realization obtained from M takes the form of an (infinite-dimensional) Toeplitz operator with a symbol that is a reflection of the initial realization for M. 3) Starting with a subclass of rational matrix functions, including scalar-valued corresponding to low-pass wavelet filters, we obtain the corresponding infinite products that realize the Fourier transforms of generators of \mathbf L_2(\mathbb R) wavelets. 4) We use both the realizations for M and the corresponding infinite product to produce a matrix representation of the Ruelle-transfer operators used in wavelet theory. By matrix representation we refer to the slanted (and sparse) matrix which realizes the Ruelle-transfer operator under consideration.
