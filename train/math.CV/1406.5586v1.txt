This paper has a twofold purpose: on one hand we deepen the study of slice regular functions by studying their behavior with respect to the so-called C-property and anti-C-property. We show that, for any fixed basis of the algebra of quaternions \mathbb{H} any slice regular function decomposes into the sum of four slice regular components each of them satisfying the C-property. Then, we will use these results to show a reproducing property of the Bergman kernels of the second kind.
