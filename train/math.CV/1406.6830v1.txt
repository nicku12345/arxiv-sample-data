In this paper we prove a new version of Krein-Langer factorization theorem in the slice hyperholomorphic setting which is more general than the one proved in [D. Alpay, F. Colombo, I. Sabadini, Krein-Langer factorization and related topics in the slice hyperholomorphic setting, J. Geom. Anal., 24 (2014), 843--872]. We treat both the case of functions with \kappa negative squares defined on subsets of the quaternionic unit ball or on subsets of the half space of quaternions with positive real part. A crucial tool in the proof of our results is the Schauder-Tychonoff theorem and an invariant subspace theorem for contractions in a Pontryagin space.
