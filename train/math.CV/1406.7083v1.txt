We consider weighted Bergman projection P_{\alpha}: L^{\infty}(\Bbb B) \rightarrow {\cal B}  where \alpha>-1 and \cal B is the Bloch space of the unit ball \Bbb B of the complex space \Bbb C^n. We obtain the exact norm of the operator P_{\alpha} where the Bloch space is observed as a space with norm (and semi-norm) induced from the Besov space B_{p},0<p<\infty,(B_{\infty}=\cal B). Our work contains, as a special case, the main results from \cite{Kalaj} and \cite{Ant}.
