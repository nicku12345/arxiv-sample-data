We reduce the problem of constructing a linear solution operator to the \bar{\partial}-equation on smoothly bounded weakly pseudoconvex domains, \Omega, in \mathbb{C}^2 to the problem of the boundary \bar{\partial}_b-equation. We show there is a solution operator to \bar{\partial} which is bounded as a map W^{s}_{(0,1)}(\Omega)\cap{ker} \bar{\partial} \rightarrow W^{s}(\Omega) for all s\ge 0 if there is a corresponding solution operator to the \bar{\partial}_b-problem with analogous regularity properties.
