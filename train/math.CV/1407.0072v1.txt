Assuming that S is the space of functions of regular variation, \omega\in S, 0< p<\infty, a function f holomorphic in B^n is said to be of Besov space B_p(\omega) if \|f\|^p_{B_p(\omega )}=\int_{B^n} (1-|z|^2)^p|Df(z)|^p\frac{\omega(1-|z|)}{(1-|z|^2)^{n+1}}d\nu(z) <+\infty, where d\nu (z)  is the volume measure on B^n and D  stands for a fractional derivative of f.   We consider operators on B_p(\omega) and show, that they are bounded.
