In this paper we obtain sharp coefficient bounds for certain p-valent starlike functions of order \beta, 0\le \beta<1. Initially this problem was handled by Aouf in "M. K. Aouf, On a class of p-valent starlike functions of order \alpha, Internat. J. Math. \& Math. Sci. 1987;10:733--744". We pointed out that the proof given by Aouf was incorrect and a correct proof is presented in this paper.
