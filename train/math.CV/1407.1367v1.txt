Let D and \Omega be Jordan domains with Dini's smooth boundaries and and let f:D\mapsto \Omega be a harmonic homeomorphism. The object of the paper is to prove the following result: If f is quasiconformal, then f is Lipschitz. This extends some recent results, where stronger assumptions on the boundary are imposed, and somehow is optimal, since it coincides with the best condition for Lipschitz behavior of conformal mappings in the plane and conformal parametrization of minimal surfaces.
