We consider the following conjecture (from Huang, et al): Let \Delta^+ denote the upper half disc in \mathbb{C} and let \gamma = ( - 1, 1) (viewed as an interval in the real axis in \mathbb{C}). Assume that F is a holomorphic function on \Delta^+ with continuous extension up to \gamma such that F maps \gamma into \{|\mbox{Im} z|\leq C|\mbox{Re} z|\}, for some positive C. If F vanishes to infinite order at 0 then F vanishes identically. We show that given the conditions of the conjecture, either F\equiv 0 or there is a sequence in \Delta^+, converging to 0, along which \mbox{Im} F/\mbox{Re} F (defined where \mbox{Re} F\neq 0) is unbounded.
