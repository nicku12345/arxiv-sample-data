We prove the spectral mapping theorem \sigma_e(A_\phi) = \phi(\sigma_e(A_z)) for the Fredholm spectrum of a truncated Toeplitz operator A_\phi with symbol \phi in the Sarason algebra C+H^\infty acting on a coinvariant subspace K_\theta of the Hardy space H^2. Our second result says that a truncated Hankel operator on the subspace K_\theta generated by a one-component inner function \theta is compact if and only if it has a continuous symbol. We also suppose a description of truncated Toeplitz and Hankel operators in Schatten classes S^p.
