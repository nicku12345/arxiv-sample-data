In \mathbb{C}^2, we classify the domains for which \rm Aut(\Omega) is noncompact and describe these domains by their defining functions. This note is based on the technique of the scaling method introduced by Frankel \cite{Fr86} and Kim \cite{Ki90}. One feature of this article is that we are able to analyze the defining functions of infinite type boundary. As a corollary, we also prove a result that under some conditions, \rm Aut(\Omega) contains \mathbb{R}, which is an extension of \cite{Fr86}.
