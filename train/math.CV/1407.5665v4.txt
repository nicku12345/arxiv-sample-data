A local behavior of closed open discrete mappings of Orlicz--Sobolev classes in {\Bbb R}^n, n\ge 3, is studied. It is proved that, mappings mentioned above have continuous extension to isolated boundary point x_0 of a domain D\setminus\{x_0\} whenever n-1 degree of its inner dilatation has FMO (finite mean oscillation) at the point and, besides that, limit sets of f at x_0 and \partial D are disjoint. Another sufficient condition of possibility of continuous extension is a divergence of some integral
