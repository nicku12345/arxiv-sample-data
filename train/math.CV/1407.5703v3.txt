In the present paper, we study the regularity of the Andersson-Samuelsson Koppelman integral operator on the A_1-singularity. Particularly, we prove L^p- and C^0-estimates. As applications, we obtain L^p-homotopy formulas for the \bar{\partial}-equation on the A_1-singularity, and we prove that the \mathcal{A}-forms introduced by Andersson-Samuelsson are continuous on the A_1-singularity.
