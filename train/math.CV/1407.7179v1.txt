In this paper, we investigate some properties on harmonic functions and solutions to Poisson equations. First, we will discuss the Lipschitz type spaces on harmonic functions. Secondly, we establish the Schwarz-Pick lemma for harmonic functions in the unit ball \IB^n of \IR^n, and then we apply it to obtain a Bloch theorem for harmonic functions in Hardy spaces. At last, we use a normal family argument to extend the Landau-Bloch type theorem to functions which are solutions to Poisson equations.
