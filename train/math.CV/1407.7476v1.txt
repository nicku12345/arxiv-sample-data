We consider local modifications \omega_n+f^*\omega_d of the Fubini-Study metric (with associated (1,1)-form \omega_n) on an open subset \Omega\subset \bC\bP^n induced by a local holomorphic mapping f\colon \Omega\to \bP^d. Our main result is that there are "gaps" in potential dimensions m such that the modification can be obtained as h^*\omega_m for some local holomorphic mapping h\colon \Omega\to \bC\bP^m. We also consider the case of rational conformal factors.
