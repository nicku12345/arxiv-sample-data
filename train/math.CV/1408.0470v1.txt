We show that homeomorphisms f in {\Bbb R}^n, n\geqslant3, of finite distortion in the Orlicz--Sobolev classes W^{1,\varphi}_{\rm loc} with a condition on \varphi of the Calderon type and, in particular, in the Sobolev classes W^{1,p}_{\rm loc} for p>n-1 are the so-called lower Q-homeomorphisms, Q(x)=K^{\frac{1}{n-1}}_I(x,f), where K_I(x,f) is its inner dilatation. The statement is valid also for all finitely bi-Lipschitz mappings that a far--reaching extension of the well-known classes of isometric and quasiisometric mappings. This makes pos\-sib\-le to apply our theory of the boundary behavior of the lower Q-homeomorphisms to all given classes.
