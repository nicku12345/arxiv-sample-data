The article is devoted to the geometry of solutions to the chordal Loewner equation which is based on the comparison of singular solutions and harmonic measures for the sides of a slit in the upper half-plane generated by a driving term. An asymptotic ratio for harmonic measures of slit sides is found for a slit which is tangential to a straight line under a given angle, and for a slit with high order tangency to a circular arc tangential to the real axis.
