We prove estimates in H\"{o}lder spaces for some Cauchy-type integral operators representing holomorphic functions in Cartesian and symmetric products of planar domains. As a consequence, we obtain information on the boundary regularity in H\"{o}lder spaces of proper holomorphic maps between symmetric products of planar domains.
