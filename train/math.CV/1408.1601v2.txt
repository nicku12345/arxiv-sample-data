In this paper we prove an asymptotically sharp Bernstein-type inequality for polynomials on analytic Jordan arcs. Also a general statement on mapping of a domain bounded by finitely many Jordan curves onto a complement to a system of the same number of arcs with rational function is presented here. This fact, as well as, Borwein-Erd\'elyi inequality for derivative of rational functions on the unit circle, Gonchar-Grigorjan estimate of the norm of holomorphic part of meromorphic functions and Totik's construction of fast decreasing polynomials play key roles in the proof of the main result.
