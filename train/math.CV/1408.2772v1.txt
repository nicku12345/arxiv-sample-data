In this paper our aim is to extend and improve the sufficient conditions for integral operators involving the normalized forms of the generalized Bessel functions of the first kind to be univalent in the open unit disk as investigated recently by (Erhan, E. Orhan, H. and Srivastava, H. (2011). Some sufficient conditions for univalence of certain families of integral operators involving generalized Bessel functions. Taiwanese Journal of Mathematics, 15 (2), pp.883-917) and (Baricz, \'A. and Frasin, B. (2010). Univalence of integral operators involving Bessel functions. Applied Mathematics Letters, 23 (4), pp.371-376).
