The pentablock is a Hartogs domain over the symmetrized bidisc. The domain is a bounded inhomogeneous pseudoconvex domain, and does not have a \mathcal{C}^{1} boundary. Recently, Agler-Lykova-Young constructed a special subgroup of the group of holomorphic automorphisms of the pentablock, and Kosi\'nski completely described the group of holomorphic automorphisms of the pentablock. The purpose of this paper is to prove that any proper holomorphic self-mapping of the pentablock must be an automorphism.
