We first characterize those composition operators that are essentially normal on the weighted Bergman space A^2_s(D) for any real s>-1, where induced symbols are automorphisms of the unit disk D. Using the same technique, we investigate the automorphic composition operators on the Hardy space H^2(B_N) and the weighted Bergman spaces A^2_s(B_N) (s>-1). Furthermore, we give some composition operators induced by linear fractional self-maps of the unit ball B_N that are not essentially normal.
