Assume that \Omega_{1} and \Omega_{2} are two smooth bounded pseudoconvex domains in \mathbb{C}^{2} that intersect (real) transversely, and that \Omega_{1} \cap \Omega_{2} is a domain (i.e. is connected). If the \overline{\partial}-Neumann operators on \Omega_{1} and on \Omega_{2} are compact, then so is the \overline{\partial}-Neumann operator on \Omega_{1} \cap \Omega_{2}. The corresponding result holds for the \overline{\partial}-Neumann operators on (0,n-1)-forms on domains in \mathbb{C}^{n}.
