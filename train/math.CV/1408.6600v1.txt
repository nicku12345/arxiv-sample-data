In this paper, we consider the value distribution of the differential polynomials f^2f^{(k)}-1 where k is a positive integer, and obtain some estimates only by the reduced counting function. Our result answers a question in (Some inequalities of differential polynomials, Mathematical Inequalities and Applications, \textbf{12}(2009), no.1, 99--113) completely.
