In any positive CR-dimension and CR-codimension we provide a construction of real-analytic holomorphically nondegenerate CR-submanifolds, which are C^\infty CR-equivalent, but are inequivalent holomorphically. As a corollary, we provide the negative answer to the conjecture of Ebenfelt and Huang \cite{eh} on the analyticity of CR-equivalences between real-analytic Levi nonflat hypersurfaces in dimension 2.
