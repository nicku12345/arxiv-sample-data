In this survey, we explain a version of topological L^2-Serre duality for singular complex spaces with arbitrary singularities. This duality can be used to deduce various L^2-vanishing theorems for the \overline\partial-equation on singular spaces. As one application, we prove Hartogs' extension theorem for (n-1)-complete spaces. Another application is the characterization of rational singularities. It is shown that complex spaces with rational singularities behave quite tame with respect to some \overline\partial-equation in the L^2-sense. More precisely: a singular point is rational if and only if the appropriate L^2-\overline\partial-complex is exact in this point. So, we obtain an L^2-\overline\partial-resolution of the structure sheaf in rational singular points.
