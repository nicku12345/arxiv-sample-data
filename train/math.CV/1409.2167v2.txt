Under a condition of the Calderon type on \varphi, we show that a homeomorphism f of finite distortion in W^{1,\varphi}_{\rm loc} and, in particular, f\in W^{1,q}_{\rm loc} for q>n-1 in {\Bbb R}^n, n\ge 3, is a lower Q-homeomorphisms with respect to the p-modulus with \left[ K_{I,\alpha}(x,f)\right]^{\beta}, p>n-1 and a ring Q_{*}-homeomorphism with respect to the \frac{p}{p-n+1}-modulus with Q_{*}(x)=K_{I,\alpha}(x,f) where  K_{I,\alpha}(x,f) is its inner \alpha-dilatation and \alpha=\frac{p}{p-n+1}, \beta=\frac{p-n+1}{n-1}.
