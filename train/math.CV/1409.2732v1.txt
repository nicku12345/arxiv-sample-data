We study a complex valued version of the Sobolev inequalities and its relationship to compactness of the d-bar-Neumann operator. For this purpose we use an abstract characterization of compactness derived from a general description of precompact subsets in L^2-spaces. Finally we remark that the d-bar-Neumann operator can be continuously extended provided a subelliptic estimate holds.
