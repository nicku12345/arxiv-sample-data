It has been recently shown that for a convex domain \Omega in \mathbb C^n and w\in\Omega the function F_\Omega(w):=\big(K_\Omega(w)\lambda(I_\Omega(w))\big)^{1/n}, where K_\Omega is the Bergman kernel on the diagonal and I_\Omega(w) the Kobayashi indicatrix, satisfies 1\leq F_\Omega\leq 4. While the lower bound is optimal, not much more is known about the upper bound. In general it is quite difficult to compute F_\Omega even numerically and the highest value of it obtained so far is 1.010182\dots In this paper we present precise, although rather complicated formulas for the ellipsoids \Omega=\{|z_1|^{2m}+|z_2|^2<1\} (with m\geq 1/2) and all w, as well as for \Omega=\{|z_1|+|z_2|<1\} and w on the diagonal. The Bergman kernel for those ellipsoids had been known, the main point is to compute the volume of the Kobayashi indicatrix. It turns out that in the second case the function \lambda(I_\Omega(w)) is not C^{3,1}.
