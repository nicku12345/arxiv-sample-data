We consider the limiting behavior of Teichm\"uller geodesics in the universal Teichm\"uller space T(\mathbb{H}). Our main result states that the limits of the Teichm\"uller geodesics in the Thurston's boundary of T(\mathbb{H}) may depend on both vertical and horizontal foliation of the corresponding holomorphic quadratic differential.
