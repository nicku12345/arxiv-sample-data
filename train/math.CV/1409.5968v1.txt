We give a new proof of Faran's and Lebl's results by means of a new CR-geometric approach and classify all holomorphic mappings from the sphere in \mathbb C^2 to Levi-nondegenerate hyperquadrics in \mathbb C^3. We use the tools developed by Lamel, which allow us to isolate and study the most interesting class of holomorphic mappings. This family of so-called nondegenerate and transversal maps we denote by \mathcal F. For \mathcal F we introduce a subclass \mathcal N of maps which are normalized with respect to the group \mathcal G of automorphisms fixing a given point. With the techniques introduced by Baouendi--Ebenfelt--Rothschild and Lamel we classify all maps in \mathcal N. This intermediate result is crucial to obtain a complete classification of \mathcal F by considering the transitive part of the automorphism group of the hyperquadrics.
