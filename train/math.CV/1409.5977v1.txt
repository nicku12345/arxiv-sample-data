We present necessary and sufficient conditions on planar compacta K and continuous functions f on K in order that f generates the algebras P(K), R(K), A(K) or C(K). We also unveil quite surprisingly simple examples of non-polynomial convex compacta K\subseteq\mathbb C and f\in P(K) with the property that f \in P(K) is a homeomorphism, but for which f^{-1}\notin P(f(K)). As a consequence, such functions do not admit injective holomorphic extensions to the interior of the polynomial convex hull \widehat K. On the other hand, it will be shown that the restriction f^*|_G of the Gelfand-transform f^* of an injective function f\in P(K) is injective on every regular, bounded complementary component G of K. A necessary and sufficient condition in terms of the behaviour of f on the outer boundary of K is given in order f admits a holomorphic injective extension to \widehat K. We also include some results on the existence of continuous logarithms on punctured compacta containing the origin in their boundary.
