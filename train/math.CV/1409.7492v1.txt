Let \varphi be a self-map of the unit disk and let C_\varphi denote the composition operator acting on the standard Dirichlet space \mathcal{D}. A necessary condition for compactness of a difference of two bounded composition operators acting on \mathcal{D}, is given. As an application, a characterization of disk automorphisms \varphi and \psi for which the commutator [C^*_\psi,C_\varphi] is compact, is given.
