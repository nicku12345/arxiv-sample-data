We present a collection of results on (weak) m-extremals and m-geodesics, concerning general properties, the planar case, quasi-balanced pseudoconvex domains, complex ellipsoids, the Euclidean ball and boundary properties. We prove 3-geodesity of 3-extremals in the Euclidean ball. Equivalence of weak m-extremality and m-extremality in some class of convex complex ellipsoids, containing symmetric ones and \mathcal C^2-smooth ones is showed. Moreover, first examples of 3-extremals being not 3-geodesics in convex domains are given.
