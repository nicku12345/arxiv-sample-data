We here study Finite Impulse Response (FIR) rectangular, not necessarily causal, systems which are (para)-unitary on the unit circle (=the class \mathcal{U}). First, we offer three characterizations of these systems. Then, introduce a %easy-to-use description of all FIRs in \mathcal{U}, as copies of a real polytope, parametrized by the dimensions and the McMillan degree of the FIRs.   Finally, we present six simple ways (along with their combinations) to construct, from any FIR, a large family of FIRs, of various dimensions and McMillan degrees, so that whenever the original system is in \mathcal{U}, so is the whole family.   A key role is played by Hankel matrices.
