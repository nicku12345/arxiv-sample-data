In this paper, we investigate the compactness of the commutator [C_\psi^{\ast}, C_\varphi] on the Hardy space H^2(B_N) or the weighted Bergman space A^2_s(B_N) (s>-1), when \varphi and \psi are automorphisms of the unit ball B_N. We obtain that [C_\psi^{\ast}, C_\varphi] is compact if and only if \varphi and \psi commute and they are both unitary. This generalizes the corresponding result in one variable. Moreover, our technique is different and simpler. In addition, we also discuss the commutator [C_\psi^{\ast}, C_\varphi] on the Dirichlet space \mathcal{D}(B_N), where \varphi and \psi are linear fractional self-maps or both automorphisms of B_N.
