In this paper, we introduce a concept of super-pseudoconvex domain. We prove that the solution of the Feffereman equation on a smoothly bounded strictly pseudoconvex domain D in \CC^n is plurisubharmonic if and only if D is super-pseudoconvex. As an application, we give a lower bound estimate the bottom of the spectrum of Laplace-Beltrami operators when D is super-pseudoconvex by using the result of Li and Wang \cite{LiWang}.
