Let \gamma_1,\gamma_2:[0,T]\to \overline{\mathbb{D}}\setminus\{0\} be parametrizations of two slits \Gamma_1:=\gamma(0,T], \Gamma_2=\gamma_2(0,T] such that \Gamma_1 and \Gamma_2 are disjoint. \\ Let g_t to be the unique normalized conformal mapping from \mathbb{D}\setminus (\gamma_1[0,t]\cup \gamma_2[0,t]) onto \mathbb{D} with g_t(0)=0, g'_t(0)>0. Furthermore, for k=1,2, denote by h_{k;t} the unique normalized conformal mapping from \mathbb{D}\setminus \gamma_k[0,t] onto \mathbb{D} with h_{k;t}(0)=0, {h'_{k;t}(0)}>0.\\ Loewner's famous theorem (\cite{Loewner:1923}) can be stated in the following way: The function t\mapsto h_{k;t} is differentiable at t_0 if and only if t\mapsto \log(h_{k;t}'(0)) is differentiable at t_0.\\ In this paper we compare the differentiability of t\mapsto h_{k;t} with that of t\mapsto g_t. We show that the situation is more complicated in the case t_0=0 with \gamma_1(0)=\gamma_2(0).\\ Furthermore, we also look at this problem in the case of a multiply connected domain with its corresponding Komatu-Loewner equation.
