Let M_\ell be a smooth Levi-nondegenerate hypersurface of signature \ell in \mathbf C^n with  n\ge 3, and write H_\ell^N for the standard hyperquadric of the same signature in \mathbf C^N with N-n< \frac{n-1}{2}. Let F be a holomorphic map sending M_\ell into H_\ell^N. Assume F does not send a neighborhood of M_\ell in \mathbf C^n into H_\ell^N. We show that F is necessarily CR transversal to M_\ell at any point. Equivalently, we show that F is a local CR embedding from M_\ell into H_\ell^N.
