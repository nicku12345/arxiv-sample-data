We establish that every K-quasiconformal mapping of w of the unit disk \ID onto a C^2-Jordan domain \Omega is Lipschitz provided that \Delta w\in L^p(\ID) for some p>2. We also prove that if in this situation K\to 1 with \|\Delta w\|_{L^p(\ID)}\to 0, and \Omega \to \ID in C^{1,\alpha}-sense with \alpha>1/2, then the bound for the Lipschitz constant tends to 1. In addition, we provide a quasiconformal analogue of the Smirnov absolute continuity result over the boundary.
