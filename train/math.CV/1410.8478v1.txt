We extend the result of Lavrentiev which asserts that the harmonic measure and the arc-length measure are A_\infty equivalent in a chord-arc Jordan domain. By using this result we extend the classical result of Lindel\"of to the class of quasiconformal (q.c.) harmonic mappings by proving the following assertion. Assume that f is a quasiconformal harmonic mapping of the unit disk \mathbf{U} onto a Jordan domain. Then the function A(z)=\arg(\partial_\varphi(f(z))/z) where z=re^{i\varphi}, is well-defined and smooth in \mathbf{U}^*=\{z: 0<|z|<1\} and has a continuous extension to the boundary of the unit disk if and only if the image domain has C^1 boundary.
