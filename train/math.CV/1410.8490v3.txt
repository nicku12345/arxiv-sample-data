In this paper we study the Bergman kernel and projection on the unbounded worm domain  \mathcal{W}_\infty = \big\{(z_1,z_2)\in\mathbb{C}^2 : \big|z_1-e^{i\log|z_2|^2}\big|^2<1, z_2\neq0\big\}.  We first show that the Bergman space of \mathcal{W}_\infty is infinite dimensional. Then we study Bergman kernel K and Bergman projection \mathcal{P} for \mathcal{W}_\infty. We prove that K(z,w) extends holomorphically in z (and antiholomorphically in w) near each point of the boundary except for a specific subset that we study in detail. By means of an appropriate asymptotic expansion for K, we prove that the Bergman projection \mathcal{P}:W^s\not\to W^s if s>0 and \mathcal{P}:L^p\not\to L^p if p\neq2, where W^s denotes the classic Sobolev space, and L^p the Lebesgue space, respectively, on \mathcal{W}_\infty.
