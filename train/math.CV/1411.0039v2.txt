If moments of singular measures are passed as inputs to the entropy maximization procedure, the optimization algorithm might not terminate. The framework developed in our previous paper demonstrated how input moments of measures, on a broad range of domains, can be conditioned to ensure convergence of the entropy maximization. Here we numerically illustrate the developed framework on simplest possible examples: measures with one-dimensional, bounded supports. Three examples of measures are used to numerically compare approximations obtained through entropy maximization with and without the conditioning step.
