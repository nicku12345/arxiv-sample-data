We study the Bergman space interpolation problem of open Riemann surfaces obtained from a compact Riemann surface by removing a finite number of points. We equip such a surface with what we call an asymptotically flat conformal metric, i.e., a complete metric with zero curvature outside a compact subset. We then establish necessary and sufficient conditions for interpolation in weighted Bergman spaces over asymptotically flat Riemann surfaces.
