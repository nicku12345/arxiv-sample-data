In this paper, we give a general boundary Schwarz lemma for holomorphic mappings between unit balls in any dimensions. It is proved that if the mapping f\in C^{1+\alpha} at z_0\in \partial \mathbb B^n with f(z_0)=w_0\in \partial \mathbb B^N for any n,N\geq 1, then the Jacobian matrix J_f(z_0) maps the tangent space T_{z_0}(\partial \mathbb B^n) to T_{w_0}(\partial \mathbb B^N), and the holomorphic tangent space T^{(1,0)}_{z_0}(\partial \mathbb B^n) to T^{(1,0)}_{w_0}(\partial \mathbb B^N) as well.
