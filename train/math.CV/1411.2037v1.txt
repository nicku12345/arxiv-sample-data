We prove a smooth version of the classical Schwarz reflection principle for CR mappings between an abstract CR manifold M and a generic CR manifold embedded in euclidean complex space. As a consequence of our results, we settle a conjecture of X. Huang and provide a solution to a question raised by Forstneric.
