Given a parabolic map in one dimension f(z) = z+O(z^2), f \neq Id, it is known that there exists the analogous of stable and unstable domains. That is, domains in which every point is attracted by f (and by the inverse f^{-1}) towards the fixed point. In this paper we prove that there exists a natural parametrization for the unstable manifold in terms of iterates for some subset of parabolic maps. Furthermore, we prove that this parametrization is valid also in the case of skew-product maps that satisfy certain conditions. Finally, we give an application of this fact to construct Fatou disks for skew-product maps that are parabolic in each direction.
