We introduce a calculus for the class ASM(X) of direct images of semi-meromorphic currents on a reduded analytic space X, that extends the classical calculus due to Coleff, Herrera and Passare. Our main result is that each element in this class acts as a kind of multiplication on the sheaf \PM_X of pseudomeromorphic currents on X. We also prove that ASM(X) as well as \PM_X and certain subsheaves are closed under the action of holomorphic differential operators and interior multiplication by holomorphic vector fields.
