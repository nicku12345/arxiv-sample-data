Let \mu be a positive finite measure on the unit circle and \mathcal{D} (\mu) the associated Dirichlet space. The generalized Brown-Shields conjecture asserts that an outer function f \in \mathcal{D} (\mu ) is cyclic if and only if c\_\mu (Z (f))= 0, where c\_\mu is the capacity associated with \mathcal{D} (\mu) and Z(f) is the zero set of f. In this paper we prove that this conjecture is true for measures with countable support. We also give in this case a complete and explicit characterization of invariant subspaces.
