Let M be a complex- or real-analytic manifold, \theta be a singular distribution and \mathcal{I} a coherent ideal sheaf defined on M. We prove the existence of a local resolution of singularities of \mathcal{I} that preserves the class of singularities of \theta, under the hypothesis that the considered class of singularities is invariant by \theta-admissible blowings-up. In particular, if \theta is monomial, we prove the existence of a local resolution of singularities of \mathcal{I} that preserves the monomiality of the singular distribution \theta.
