Given a real- or complex-analytic singular foliation \theta with n first integrals of meromorphic or Darboux type (f_1,\dots,f_n), we prove that there exists a local monomialization of the first integrals. In particular, if \theta is generated by the n first integrals, we prove the existence of a local reduction of singularities of \theta to monomial singularities.
