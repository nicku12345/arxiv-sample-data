In this paper, we study operator-theoretic properties of the compressed shift operators S_{z_1} and S_{z_2} on complements of submodules of the Hardy space over the bidisk H^2(\mathbb{D}^2). Specifically, we study Beurling-type submodules - namely submodules of the form \theta H^2(\mathbb{D}^2) for \theta inner - using properties of Agler decompositions of \theta to deduce properties of S_{z_1} and S_{z_2} on model spaces H^2(\mathbb{D}^2) \ominus \theta H^2(\mathbb{D}^2). Results include characterizations (in terms of \theta) of when a commutator [S_{z_j}^*, S_{z_j}] has rank n and when subspaces associated to Agler decompositions are reducing for S_{z_1} and S_{z_2}. We include several open questions.
