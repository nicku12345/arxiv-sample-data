This paper examines the broad structure on Stein manifolds and how it generalizes the notion of a domain of holomorphy in \mathbb C^n. Along with this generalization, we see that Stein manifolds share key properties from domains of holomorphy, and we prove one of these major consequences. In particular, we investigate an equivalence, similar to domains of holomorphy and pseudoconvexity, on the class of manifolds. Then, we examine the canonical symplectic structure of Stein manifolds inherited from this equivalence, and how its symplectic topology develops.
