We study the topology of analytic families of n-dimensional complex hypersurfaces having an isolated singularity at the origin. We prove that such a family is \mu-constant if and only if it admits an uniform Milnor radius, which happens if and only if it has constant embedded topological type. In particular, this solves the \mu-constant problem, formulated by D.T. L\^e and C.P. Ramanujam in 1976.
