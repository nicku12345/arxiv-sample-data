A sequence which is a finite union of interpolating sequences for H^\infty have turned out to be especially important in the study of Bergman spaces. The Blaschke products B(z) with such zero sequences have been shown to be exactly those such that the multiplication f \mapsto fB defines an operator with closed range on the Bergman space. Similarly, they are exactly those Blaschke products that boundedly divide functions in the Bergman space which vanish on their zero sequence. There are several characterizations of these sequences, and here we add two more to those already known. We also provide a particularly simple new proof of one of the known characterizations. One of the new characterizations is that they are interpolating sequences for a more general interpolation problem.
