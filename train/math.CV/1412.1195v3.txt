Let V be a projective subvariety of \mathbb P^n(\mathbb C). A family of hypersurfaces \{Q_i\}_{i=1}^q in \mathbb P^n(\mathbb C) is said to be in N-subgeneral position with respect to V if for any 1\le i_1<\cdots <i_{N+1},  V\cap (\bigcap_{j=1}^{N+1}Q_{i_j})=\emptyset. In this paper, we will prove a second main theorem for meromorphic mappings of \mathbb C^m into V intersecting hypersurfaces in subgeneral position with truncated counting functions. As an application of the above theorem, we give a uniqueness theorem for meromorphic mappings of \mathbb C^m into V sharing a few hypersurfaces without counting multiplicity. In particular, we extend the uniqueness theorem for linear nondegenerate meromorphic mappings of \mathbb C^m into \mathbb P^n(\mathbb C) sharing 2n+3 hyperplanes in general position to the case where the mappings may be linear degenerate.
