Let {{\bf x}}=(x_1,\dots,x_d) \in [-1,1]^d be linearly independent over \mathbb Z, set K=\{(e^{z},e^{x_1 z},e^{x_2 z}\dots,e^{x_d z}): |z| \le 1\}. We prove sharp estimates for the growth of a polynomial of degree n, in terms of E_n({\bf x}):=\sup\{\|P\|_{\Delta^{d+1}}:P \in \mathcal P_n(d+1), \|P\|_K \le 1\}, where \Delta^{d+1} is the unit polydisk. For all {{\bf x}} \in [-1,1]^d with linearly independent entries, we have the lower estimate \log E_n({\bf x})\ge \frac{n^{d+1}}{(d-1)!(d+1)} \log n - O(n^{d+1}); for Diophantine \bf x, we have \log E_n({\bf x})\le \frac{ n^{d+1}}{(d-1)!(d+1)}\log n+O( n^{d+1}). In particular, this estimate holds for almost all \bf x with respect to Lebesgue measure.
