In the first part of this study we consider the boundedness and compactness properties of Cauchy-Fantappie type operators on Poletsky-Stessin Hardy spaces H^{p}_{u}(\mathbb{B}^{\textbf{p}}) of complex ellipsoids. We show that boundedness and compactness criteria are given by the Carleson conditions. In addition we give a basic compactness property for the subsets of H^{p}_{u}(\mathbb{B}^{\textbf{p}}) spaces and the characterization of weakly convergent sequences in H^{p}_{u}(\mathbb{B}^{\textbf{p}}). In the second part we will discuss the dual complement of the complex ellipsoid and we will give a duality result for H^{p}_{u}(\mathbb{B}^{\textbf{p}}) spaces in the sense of Grothendieck-K\"{o}the-da Silva.
