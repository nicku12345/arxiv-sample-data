Let f be a holomorphic function on the unit disc, and (S_{n_{k}}) be a subsequence of its Taylor polynomials about 0. It is shown that the nontangential limit of f and lim_{k\rightarrow \infty }S_{n_{k}} agree at almost all points of the unit circle where they simultaneously exist. This result yields new information about the boundary behaviour of universal Taylor series. The key to its proof lies in a convergence theorem for harmonic measures that is of independent interest.
