We determine the automorphism groups of unbounded homogeneous domains with boundaries of light cone type. Furthermore we present the group-theoretic characterization of the domain. As a corollary we prove the non-existence of compact quotients of a unbounded homogeneous domain. We also give a counterexample of the characterization.
