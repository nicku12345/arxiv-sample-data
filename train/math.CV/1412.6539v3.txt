A paper is devoted to study of topological properties of some class of space mappings. It is showed that, sense preserving mappings f:D\rightarrow \overline{{\Bbb R}^n} of a domain D\subset{\Bbb R}^n, n\geqslant 2, satisfying some modulus inequality with respect to p-modulus of families of curves, are open and discrete at some restrictions on a function Q, which determinate inequality mentioned above.
