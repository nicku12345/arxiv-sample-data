For some class of mappings, which are generalization of space quasiisometries, an upper estimate for a measure of image of a ball is obtained. As consequence, it is obtained one analog of Schwartz lemma for mappings mentioned above. Results of the paper are applicable in Sobolev and Orlicz--Sobolev classes.
