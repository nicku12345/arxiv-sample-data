We consider the class of all sense-preserving complex-valued harmonic mappings f=h+\bar {g} defined on the unit disk \ID with the normalization h(0)=h'(0)-1=0 and g(0)=g'(0)=0 with the second complex dilatation \omega:\,\ID\rightarrow \ID, g'(z)=\omega (z)h'(z). In this paper, the authors determine sufficient conditions on h and \omega that would imply the univalence of harmonic mappings f=h+\bar {g} on \ID.
