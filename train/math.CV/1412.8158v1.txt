Let {\mathcal A} denote the family of all functions f analytic in the open unit disk \ID with the normalization f(0)=0= f'(0)-1 and {\mathcal S} be the class of univalent functions from {\mathcal A}. In this paper, we consider radius of univalence of F defined by F(z)=z^{3}/(f(z)g(z)), where f and g belong to some subclasses of {\mathcal A} (for which f(z)/z and g(z)/z are non-vanishing in \ID) and, in some cases in precise form, belonging to some subclasses of {\mathcal S}. All the results are proved to be sharp. Applications of our investigation through Bessel functions are also presented.
