Let E be a compact set in \mathbb C with connected complement, and let A(E) be the class of all complex continuous function on E that are analytic in the interior E^0 of E. Let f \in A(E) be zero free on E^0. By Mergelyan's theorem f can be uniformly approximated on E by polynomials, but is it possible to realize such approximation by polynomials that are zero-free on E? This natural question has been proposed by J. Andersson and P. Gauthier. So far it has been settled for some particular sets E. The present paper describes classes of functions for which zero free approximation is possible on an arbitrary E.
