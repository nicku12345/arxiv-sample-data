Several sets of quaternionic functions are described and studied with respect to hy-perholomorphy, addition and (non commutative) multiplication, on open sets of H, then Hamil-ton 4-manifolds analogous to Riemann surfaces, for H instead of C, are defined, and so begin to describe a class of four dimensional manifolds.
