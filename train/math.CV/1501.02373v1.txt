A paper is devoted to study of local behavior of so-called Q-mappings including qua\-si\-con\-for\-mal mappings and mappings with bounded distortion. It is showed that, such mappings have removable isolated singularities whenever the grow of the mappings is note more than some function of a radius of a ball.
