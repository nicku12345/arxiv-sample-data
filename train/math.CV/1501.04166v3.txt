We propose a generalisation of analytic in a domain function of bounded index, which was introduced by J. G. Krishna and S. M. Shah \cite{krishna}. In fact, analytic in the unit ball function of bounded index by Krishna and Shah is an entire function. Our approach allows us to explore properties of analytic in the unit ball functions.   We proved the necessary and sufficient conditions of bounded L-index in direction for analytic functions. As a result, they are applied to study partial differential equations and get sufficient conditions of bounded L-index in direction for analytic solutions. Finally, we estimated growth for these functions.
