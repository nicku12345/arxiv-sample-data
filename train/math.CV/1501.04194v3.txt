For a univalent smooth mapping f of the unit disk \ID of complex plane onto the manifold f(\ID), let d_f(z_0) be the radius of the largest univalent disk on the manifold f(\ID) centered at f(z_0) (|z_0|<1). The main aim of the present article is to investigate how the radius d_h(z_0) varies when the analytic function h is replaced by a sense-preserving harmonic function f=h+\overline{g}. The main result includes sharp upper and lower bounds for the quotient d_f(z_0)/d_h(z_0), especially, for a family of locally univalent Q-quasiconformal harmonic mappings f=h+\overline{g} on |z|<1. In addition, estimate on the radius of the disk of convexity of functions belonging to certain linear invariant families of locally univalent Q-quasiconformal harmonic mappings of order \alpha is obtained.
