Let c\geq0 and denote by \mathcal{K}(\mathbb{H},c) the set of all infinitesimal generators G:\mathbb{H}\to\mathbb{C} on the upper half-plane \mathbb{H} such that \limsup_{y\to\infty}y\cdot |G(iy)|\leq c. This class is related to univalent functions f:\mathbb{H}\to\mathbb{H} with hydrodynamic normalization and appears in the so called chordal Loewner equation. In this paper, we generalize the class \mathcal{K}(\mathbb{H},c) and the hydrodynamic normalization to the Euclidean unit ball in \mathbb{C}^n. The generalization is based on the observation that G\in\mathcal{K}(\mathbb{H},c) can be characterized by an inequality for the hyperbolic length of G(z).
