Suppose G is a connected complex Lie group and H is a closed complex subgroup such that X := G/H is Kaehler and the codimension of the top non-vanishing homology group of X with coefficients in \mathbb Z_2 is less than or equal to two. We show that X is biholomorphic to a complex homogeneous manifold constructed using well-known basic building blocks, i.e., \mathbb C, \mathbb C^*, Cousin groups, and flag manifolds.
