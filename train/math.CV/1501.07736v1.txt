We prove that for any given upper semicontinuous function \varphi on an open subset E of \mathbb C^n\setminus\{0\}, such that the complex cone generated by E minus the origin is connected, the homogeneous Siciak-Zaharyuta function with the weight \varphi on E, can be represented as an envelope of a disc functional.
