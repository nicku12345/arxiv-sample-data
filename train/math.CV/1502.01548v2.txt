We introduce a positive scalar function \rho(a, \Omega) for a domain \Omega of a complex manifold X with a global holomorphic frame of the cotangent bundle by closed Abelian differentials, which heuristically measure the distance from a \in \Omega to the boundary \del\Omega. We prove an {\em estimate of Cartan--Thullen type with \rho(a, \Omega)} for holomorphically convex hulls of compact subsets. In one dimensional case, we apply the obtained estimate of \rho(a, \Omega) to give a new proof of Behnke-Stein's Theorem for the Steiness of open Riemann surfaces. We then use the same idea to deal with the Levi problem for ramified Riemann domains over \C^n. We obtain some geometric conditions in terms of \rho(a, X) which imply the validity of the Levi problem for a finitely sheeted Riemann domain over \C^n.
