In the present paper, it was studied the boundary behavior of the so-called lower Q-homeomorphisms in the plane that are a natural generalization of the quasiconformal mappings. In particular, it was found a series of effective conditions on the function Q(z) for a homeomorphic extension of the given mappings to the boundary by prime ends. The developed theory is applied to mappings with finite distortion by Iwaniec, also to solutions of the Beltrami equations, as well as to finitely bi--Lipschitz mappings that a far--reaching extension of the known classes of isometric and quasiisometric mappings.
