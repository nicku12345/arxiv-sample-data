In this paper, we present an alternative and elementary proof of a sharp version of the classical boundary Schwarz lemma by Frolova et al. with initial proof via analytic semigroup approach and Julia-Carath\'eodory theorem for univalent holomorphic self-mappings of the open unit disk \mathbb D\subset \mathbb C. Our approach has its extra advantage to get the extremal functions of the inequality in the boundary Schwarz lemma.
