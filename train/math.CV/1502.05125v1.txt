In this note, we consider meromorphic univalent functions f(z) in the unit disc with a simple pole at z=p\in(0,1) which have a k-quasiconformal extension to the extended complex plane \hat{\mathbb C}, where 0\leq k < 1. We denote the class of such functions by \Sigma_k(p). We first prove an area theorem for functions in this class. Next, we derive a sufficient condition for meromorphic functions in the unit disc with a simple pole at z=p\in(0,1) to belong to the class \Sigma_k(p). Finally, we give a convolution property for functions in the class \Sigma_k(p).
