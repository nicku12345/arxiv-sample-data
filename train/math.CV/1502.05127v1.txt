Marx and Strohh\"acker showed around in 1933 that f(z)/z is subordinate to 1/(1-z) for a normalized convex function f on the unit disk |z|<1. Brickman, Hallenbeck, MacGregor and Wilken proved in 1973 further that f(z)/z is subordinate to k_\alpha(z)/z if f is convex of order \alpha for 1/2\le\alpha<1 and conjectured that this is true also for 0<\alpha<1/2. Here, k_\alpha is the standard extremal function in the class of normalized convex functions of order \alpha and k_0(z)=z/(1-z). We prove the conjecture and study geometric properties of convex functions of order \alpha. In particular, we prove that (f+g)/2 is starlike whenever f and g both are convex of order 3/5.
