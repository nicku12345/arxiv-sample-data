Given a regular compact set E in the complex plane, a unit measure \mu supported by \partial E, a triangular point set \beta := \{\{\beta_{n,k}\}_{k=1}^n\}_{n=1}^{\infty},\beta\subset \partial E and a function f, holomorphic on E, let \pi_{n,m}^{\beta,f} be the associated multipoint \beta- Pad\'e approximant of order (n,m). We show that if the sequence \pi_{n,m}^{\beta,f}, n\in\Lambda, m- fixed, converges exact maximally to f, as n\to\infty,n\in\Lambda inside the maximal domain of m- meromorphic continuability of f relatively to the measure \mu, then the points \beta_{n,k} are uniformly distributed on \partial E with respect to the measure \mu as  n\in\Lambda. Furthermore, a result about the zeros behavior of the exact maximally convergent sequence \Lambda is provided, under the condition that \Lambda is "dense enough."
