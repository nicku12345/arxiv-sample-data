In this paper we show that that on a strongly pseudoconvex domain D the projective limit of all Poletsky--Stessin Hardy spaces H^p_u(D), introduced in \cite{PS}, is isomorphic to the space H^\infty(D) of bounded holomorphic functions on D endowed with a special topology. To prove this we show that Carath\'eodory balls lie in approach regions, establish a sharp inequality for the Monge--Amp\'ere mass of the envelope of plurisubharmonic exhaustion functions and use these facts to demonstrate that the intersection of all Poletsky--Stessin Hardy spaces H^p_u(D) is H^\infty(D).
