On a smooth domain \Omega\subset\subset\mathbb C^n, we consider the Dirichlet problem for the complex Monge-Amp\`ere equation ((dd^cu)^n=fdV,\,u|_{b\Omega}\equiv\phi). We state the H\"older regularity of the solution u when the boundary value \phi is H\"older continuous and the density f is only L^p, p>1. Note that in former literature (Guedj-Kolodziej-Zeriahi) the weakness of the assumption f\in L^p was balanced by taking \phi\in C^{1,1} (in addition to assuming \Omega strongly pseudoconvex).
