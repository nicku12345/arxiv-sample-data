The article deals with the family {\mathcal U}(\lambda) of all functions f normalized and analytic in the unit disk such that \big |\big (z/f(z)\big )^{2}f'(z)-1\big |<\lambda  for some 0<\lambda \leq 1. The family {\mathcal U}(\lambda) has been studied extensively in the recent past and functions in this family are known to be univalent in \ID. However, the problem of determining sharp bounds for the second coefficients of functions in this family was solved recently in \cite{VY2013} by Vasudevarao and Yanagihara but the proof was complicated. In this article, we first present a simpler proof. We obtain a number of new subordination results for this family and their consequences. In addition, we show that the family {\mathcal U}(\lambda ) is preserved under a number of elementary transformations such as rotation, conjugation, dilation and omitted value transformations, but surprisingly this family is not preserved under the n-th root transformation for any n\geq 2. This is a basic here which helps to generate a number of new theorems and in particular provides a way for constructions of functions from the family {\mathcal U}(\lambda). Finally, we deal with a radius problem.
