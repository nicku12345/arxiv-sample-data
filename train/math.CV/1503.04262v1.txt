We discuss analogues of Newman and Rivlin's formula concerning the ratio of a partial sum of a power series to its limit function and present a new general result of this type for entire functions with a certain asymptotic character. The main tool used in the proof is a Riemann-Hilbert formulation for the partial sums introduced by Kriecherbauer et al. This new result makes some progress on verifying a part of the Saff-Varga Width Conjecture concerning the zero-free regions of these partial sums.
