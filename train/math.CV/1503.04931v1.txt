Let {\mathcal S} denote the family of all univalent functions f in the unit disk \ID with the normalization f(0)=0= f'(0)-1. There is an intimate relationship between the operator P_f(z)=f(z)/f'(z) and the Danikas-Ruscheweyh operator T_f:=\int_{0}^{z}(tf'(t)/f(t))\,dt. In this paper we mainly consider the univalence problem of F=P_f, where f belongs to some subclasses of {\mathcal S}. Among several sharp results and non-sharp results, we also show that if f\in {\mathcal S}, then F \in {\mathcal U} in the disk |z|<r with r\leq r_6\approx 0.360794 and conjecture that the upper bound for such r is \sqrt{2}-1.
