The purpose of this paper is to prove an interpolation formula involving derivatives for entire functions of exponential type. We extend the interpolation formula derived by J. Vaaler in [37, Theorem 9] to general L^p de Branges spaces. We extensively use techniques from de Branges' theory of Hilbert spaces of entire functions as developed in [6], but a crucial passage involves the Hilbert-type inequalities as derived in [15]. We give applications to homogeneous spaces of entire functions that involve Bessel functions and we prove a uniqueness result for extremal one-sided band-limited approximations of radial functions in Euclidean spaces.
