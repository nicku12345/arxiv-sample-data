Gonchar-Stahl's \rho^2-theorem characterizes the rate of convergence of best uniform (Chebyshev) rational approximations (with free poles) for one basic class of analytic functions. The theorem itself, its modifications and generalizations, methods involved in the proof and other related details constitute an important subfield in the theory of rational approximations of analytic functions and complex analysis.   The paper briefly outlines essentials of the subfield. Fundamental contributions by A. A. Gonchar and H. Stahl are in the center of the exposition.
