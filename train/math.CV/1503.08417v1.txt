Subsequent to our recent work on Fourier spectrum characterization of Hardy spaces H^p(\mathbb{R}) for the index range 1\leq p\leq \infty, in this paper we prove further results on rational Approximation, integral representation and Fourier spectrum characterization of functions in the Hardy spaces H^p(\mathbb{R}), 0 < p\leq \infty, with particular interest in the index range  0< p \leq 1. We show that the set of rational functions in  H^p(\mathbb{C}_{+1})  with the single pole -i is dense in  H^p(\mathbb{C}_{+1})  for 0<p<\infty. Secondly, for 0<p<1, through rational function approximation we show that any function f in L^p(\mathbb{R}) can be decomposed into a sum g+h, where g and h are, in the L^p(\mathbb{R}) convergence sense, the non-tangential boundary limits of functions in, respectively,  H^p(\mathbb{C}_{+1}) and H^{p}(\mathbb{C}_{-1}), where H^p(\mathbb{C}_k)\ (k=\pm 1)  are the Hardy spaces in the half plane  \mathbb{C}_k=\{z=x+iy: ky>0\}. We give Laplace integral representation formulas for functions in the Hardy spaces H^p, 0<p\leq2. Besides one in the integral representation formula we give an alternative version of Fourier spectrum characterization for functions in the boundary Hardy spaces H^p for 0<p\leq 1.
