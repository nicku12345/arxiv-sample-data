In [Ann. of Math. 169 (2009)], Min Ru proved a second main theorem for algebraically nondegenerate holomorphic curves in complex projective varieties intersecting fixed hypersurface targets. In this paper, by introducing a new proof method for the case of projective varieties, we generalize this result to moving hypersurface targets.
