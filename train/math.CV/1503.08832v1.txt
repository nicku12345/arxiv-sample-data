We show that every homeomorphic W^{1,1}_{\rm loc} solution f of a Beltrami equation \overline{\partial}f=\mu\,\partial f in a domain D\subseteq\Bbb C is the so--called ring Q-homeomorphism with Q(z)=K^T_{\mu}(z, z_0) where K^T_{\mu}(z, z_0) is the tangent (angular) dilatation quotient of the equation with respect to an arbitrary point z_0\in {\overline{D}}. In this connection, we develop the theory of the boundary behavior of the ring Q-homeomorphisms with respect to prime ends. On this basis, we show that, for wide classes of degenerate Beltrami equations \overline{\partial}f=\mu\,\partial f, there exist regular solutions of the Dirichlet problem in arbitrary simply connected domains in \Bbb C and pseudoregular and multivalent solutions in arbitrary finitely connected domains in \Bbb C with boundary datum \varphi that are continuous with respect to the topology of prime ends.
