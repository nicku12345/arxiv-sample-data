We define Hardy spaces H^p(D'_\beta) on the non-smooth worm domain D'_\beta=\{(z_1,z_2)\in\mathbb{C}^2:|Im z_1-\log |z_2|^2|<\frac{\pi}{2}, |\log |z_2|^2|<\beta-\frac{\pi}{2}\} and we prove a series of related results such as the existence of boundary values on the distinguished boundary \partial D'_\beta of the domain and a Fatou-type theorem (i.e. pointwise convergence to the boundary values). Thus, we study the Szeg\H{o} projection operator \widetilde{S} and the associated Szeg\H{o} kernel K_{D'_\beta}. More precisely, if H^p(\partial D'_\beta) denotes the space of functions which are boundary values for functions in H^p(D'_\beta), we prove that the operator \widetilde{S} extends to a bounded linear operator  \widetilde{S}: L^p(\partial D'_\beta)\to H^p(\partial D'_\beta)  for every p\in(1,+\infty) and  \widetilde{S}: W^{k,p}(\partial D'_\beta)\to W^{k,p}(\partial D'_\beta)  for every k>0. Here W^{k,p} denotes the Sobolev space of order k and underlying L^p norm. As a consequence of the L^p boundedness of \widetilde{S}, we prove that H^p(D'_\beta)\cap\mathcal{C}(\overline{D'_\beta}) is a dense subspace of H^p(D'_\beta).
