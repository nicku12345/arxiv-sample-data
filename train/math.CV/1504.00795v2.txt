In this paper we find regular Stein neighborhoods for a union of totally real planes M=(A+iI)\mathbb{R}^2 and N=\mathbb{R}^2 in \mathbb{C}^2 provided that the entries of a real 2 \times 2 matrix A are sufficiently small. A key step in our proof is a local construction of a suitable function \rho near the origin. The sublevel sets of \rho are strongly Levi pseudoconvex and admit strong deformation retraction to M\cup N.
