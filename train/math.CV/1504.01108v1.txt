This paper presents new stability results for matrix Wiener--Hopf factorisation. The first part of the paper examines conditions for stability of Wiener-Hopf factorisation in Daniele--Khrapkov class. The second part of the paper concerns the class of matrix functions which can be exactly or approximately reduced to the factorisation of the Daniele--Khrapkov matrices. The results of the paper are demonstrated by numerical examples with partial indices \(\{1,-1\}\), \(\{0,0\}\) and \(\{-1,-1\}\).
