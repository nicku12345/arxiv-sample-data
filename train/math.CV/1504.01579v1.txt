We complete and precise the results of [B.13] and we prove a strong version of the semi-proper direct image theorem with values in the space C f n (M) of finite type closed n--cycles in a complex space M. We describe the strongly quasi-proper maps as the class of holomorphic surjective maps which admit a meromorphic family of fibers and we prove stability properties of this class. In the Appendix we give a direct and short proof of D. Mathieu's flattening theorem (see [M.00]) for a strongly quasi-proper map which is easier and more accessible.
