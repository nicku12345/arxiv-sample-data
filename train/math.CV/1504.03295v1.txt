Theorems on continuous extension on boundary for one class of open discrete mappings between Riemannian manifolds are obtained. In particular, there is proved that, open discrete ring Q-mappings f:D\rightarrow D^{\,\prime} are extend to \partial D whenever \partial D is locally connected, \partial D^{\,\prime} is strongly accessible, and a function Q has finite mean oscillation at \partial D.
