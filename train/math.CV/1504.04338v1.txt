For 1<p<\infty and 0<s<1, let \mathcal{Q}^p_ s (\mathbb{T}) be the space of those functions f which belong to    L^p(\mathbb{T}) and satisfy \[ \sup_{I\subset \mathbb{T}}\frac{1}{|I|^s}\int_I\int_I\frac{|f(\zeta)-f(\eta)|^p}{|\zeta-\eta|^{2-s}}|d\zeta||d\eta|<\infty, \] where |I| is the length of an arc I of the unit circle \mathbb{T} . In this paper, we give a complete description of multipliers between \mathcal{Q}^p_ s (\mathbb{T}) spaces. The spectra of multiplication operators on \mathcal{Q}^p_ s (\mathbb{T}) are also obtained.
