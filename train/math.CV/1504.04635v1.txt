We reveal a complex analogue to a result about polynomial solutions to the Dirichlet Problem on ellipsoids in \mathbb{R}^n by showing that the Bergman projection on any ellipsoid in \mathbb{C}^n is such that the projection of any polynomial function of degree at most N is a holomorphic polynomial function of degree at most N. The discussion is motivated by a connection between the Bergman projection and the Khavinson-Shapiro conjecture in \mathbb{C}. We also relate the Khavinson-Shapiro conjecture to polyharmonic Bergman projections in \mathbb{R}^n by showing that these projections take polynomials to polynomials on ellipsoids.
