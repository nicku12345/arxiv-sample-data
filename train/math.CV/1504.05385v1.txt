We prove that open discrete mappings of Sobolev classes W_{\rm loc}^{1, p}, p>n-1, with locally integrable inner dilatations admit ACP_p^{\,-1}-property, which means that these mappings are absolutely continuous on almost all preimage paths with respect to p-module. In particular, our results extend the well-known Poletski\u\i\ lemma for quasiregular mappings. We also establish the upper bounds for p-module of such mappings in terms of integrals depending on the inner dilatations and arbitrary admissible functions.
