Let K be a compact subset of a totally-real manifold M, where M is either a \mathcal{C}^2-smooth graph in \mathbb{C}^{2n} over \mathbb{C}^n, or M=u^{-1}\{0\} for a \mathcal{C}^2-smooth submersion u from \mathbb{C}^n to \mathbb{R}^{2n-k}, k\leq n. In this case we show that K is polynomially convex if and only if for a fixed neighbourhood U, defined in terms of the defining functions of M, there exists a plurisubharmonic function \Psi on \mathbb{C}^n such that K\subset \{\Psi<0\}\subset U.
