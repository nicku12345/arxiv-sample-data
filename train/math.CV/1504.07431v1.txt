In this article we consider a family \mathcal{C}(A, B) of analytic and locally univalent functions on the open unit disc \ID=\{z :|z|<1\} in the complex plane that properly contains the well-known Janowski class of convex univalent functions. In this article, we determine the exact set of variability of \log(f'(z_0)) with fixed z_0 \in \ID and f"(0) whenever f varies over the class \mathcal{C}(A, B).
