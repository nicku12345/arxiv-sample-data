We give explicit integral formulas for the solutions of planar conjugate conductivity equations in a circular domain of the right half-plane with conductivity \sigma(x,y)=x^p, p\in\mathbb{Z}. The representations are obtained via a Riemann-Hilbert problem on the complex plane when p is even and on a two-sheeted Riemann surface when p is odd. They involve the Dirichlet and Neumann data on the boundary of the domain. We also show how to make the conversion from one type of conditions to the other by using the so-called global relation. The method used to derive our integral representations could be applied in any bounded simply-connected domain of the right half-plane with a smooth boundary.
