The Bergman theory of domains \{ |{z_{1} |^{\gamma}} < |{z_{2}} | < 1 \} in \mathbb{C}^2 is studied for certain values of \gamma, including all positive integers. For such \gamma, we obtain a closed form expression for the Bergman kernel, \mathbb{B}_{\gamma}. With these formulas, we make new observations relating to the Lu Qi-Keng problem and analyze the boundary behavior of \mathbb{B}_{\gamma}(z,z).
