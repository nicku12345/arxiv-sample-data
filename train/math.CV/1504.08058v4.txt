In fractal geometry, the main objects of study have been geometric objects with a global dimension that need not be integer valued. More recently, locally fractal objects, ones in which the dimension is a local property rather than a global one, have become of interest. We explore one such object, the zero set of Littlewood polynomials, its connection to more traditional fractal objects, and develop a method for computing local approximations.
