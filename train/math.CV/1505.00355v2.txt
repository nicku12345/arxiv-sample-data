Motivated by the study of the distribution of zeros of generalized Bessel-type functions, the principal goal of this paper is to identify new research directions in the theory of multiplier sequences. The investigations focus on multiplier sequences interpolated by functions which are not entire and sums, averages and parametrized families of multiplier sequences. The main results include (i) the development of a `logarithmic' multiplier sequence and (ii) several integral representations of a generalized Bessel-type function utilizing some ideas of G. H. Hardy and L. V. Ostrovskii. The explorations and analysis, augmented throughout the paper by a plethora of examples, led to a number of conjectures and intriguing open problems.
