The purpose of this note is to show that the di-bar-estimate which is needed in the Ohsawa-Takegoshi Extension Theorem [6] is a direct consequence of the Hormander-Kohn-Morrey weigthed inequality. In this inequality, the Donnelly-Fefferman argument is not required and a single 1-parameter family of non-singular weights is used. This paper is the furtherst step of a great deal of work devoted to the simplification of the original proof of Ohsawa-Takegoshi Theorem, among other papers on the subject, we mention [1] and [8] which are based on "twisted" basic estimates and, in recent time, [3] and [9].
