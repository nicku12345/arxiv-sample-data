The paper is devoted to establishing the foundations of the theory of quasiregular mappings f:M\to N between two equiregular subRiemannian manifolds of homogenuous dimension Q\geq 2. In particular, we generalize the notion of P-differentiability of Pansu and Margulis-Mostow to the setting of mappings between general subRiemannian manifolds and establish a corresponding Stepanov-type differentiability result. As a consequence, we show that a quasiregular mapping between two equiregular subRiemannian manifolds of homogenuous dimension Q\geq 2 are P-differentiable a.e., satisfies Condition N and Condition N^{-1}, and the branch set has zero Hausdorff Q-measure. Our method does not rely on the results of Margulis-Mostow.
