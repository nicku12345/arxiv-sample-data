In this work we provide an asymptotic expansion for the Szeg\H{o} kernel associated to a suitably defined Hardy space on the the non-smooth worm domain D'_\beta. After describing the singularities of the kernel, we compare it with an asymptotic expansion of the Bergman kernel. In particular, we show that the Bergman kernel has the same singularities of the first derivative of the Szeg\H{o} kernel with respect to any of the variables. On the side, we prove the boundedness of the Bergman projection operator on Sobolev spaces of integer order.
