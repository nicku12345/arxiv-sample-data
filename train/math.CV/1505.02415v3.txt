Let \[ \Gamma = \{(z+w, zw): |z|\leq 1, |w|\leq 1\} \subset \mathbb{C}^2. \] A \Gamma-inner function is defined to be a holomorphic map h from the unit disc \mathbb{D} to \Gamma whose boundary values at almost all points of the unit circle \mathbb{T} belong to the distinguished boundary b\Gamma of \Gamma. A rational \Gamma-inner function h induces a continuous map h|_\mathbb{T} from the unit circle to b\Gamma. The latter set is topologically a M\"obius band and so has fundamental group \mathbb{Z}. The {\em degree} of h is defined to be the topological degree of h|_\mathbb{T}. In a previous paper the authors showed that if h=(s,p) is a rational \Gamma-inner function of degree n then s^2-4p has exactly n zeros in the closed unit disc \mathbb{D}^-, counted with an appropriate notion of multiplicity. In this paper, with the aid of a solution of an interpolation problem for finite Blaschke products, we explicitly construct the rational \Gamma-inner functions of degree n with the n zeros of s^2-4p and the corresponding values of s, prescribed.
