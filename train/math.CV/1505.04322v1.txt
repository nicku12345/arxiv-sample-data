We study the harmonic space of line bundle valued forms over a covering manifold with a discrete group action \Gamma, and obtain an asymptotic estimate for the \Gamma-dimension of the harmonic space with respect to the tensor times k in the holomorphic line bundle L^{k}\otimes E and the type (n,q) of the differential form, when L is semipositive. In particular, we estimate the \Gamma-dimension of the corresponding reduced L^2-Dolbeault cohomology group. Essentially, we obtain a local estimate of the pointwise norm of harmonic forms with valued in semipositive line bundles over Hermitian manifolds.
