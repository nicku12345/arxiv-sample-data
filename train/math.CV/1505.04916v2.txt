We present a numerical method for the computation of the conformal map from unbounded multiply-connected domains onto lemniscatic domains. For \ell-times connected domains the method requires solving \ell boundary integral equations with the Neumann kernel. This can be done in O(\ell^2 n \log n) operations, where n is the number of nodes in the discretization of each boundary component of the multiply connected domain. As demonstrated by numerical examples, the method works for domains with close-to-touching boundaries, non-convex boundaries, piecewise smooth boundaries, and for domains of high connectivity.
