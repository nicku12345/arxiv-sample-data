We present some basic properties of the boundary relative extremal function and discuss so called boundary pluripolar sets and boundary pluripolar hulls. We show that for B-regular domains the boundary pluripolar hull is always trivial on the boundary of the domain and present a "boundary version" of Zeriahi's theorem on the completeness of pluripolar sets.
