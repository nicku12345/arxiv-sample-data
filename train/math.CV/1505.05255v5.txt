Let \Omega \subset {\mathbb C}^n \times {\mathbb R} be a bounded domain with smooth boundary such that \partial \Omega has only nondegenerate elliptic CR singularities, and let f \colon \partial \Omega \to {\mathbb C} be a smooth function that is CR at CR points of \partial \Omega (when n=1 we require separate holomorphic extensions for each real parameter). Then f extends to a smooth CR function on \bar{\Omega}, that is, an analogue of Hartogs-Bochner holds. In addition, if f and \partial \Omega are real-analytic, then f is the restriction of a function that is holomorphic on a neighborhood of \bar{\Omega} in {\mathbb C}^{n+1}. An immediate application is a (possibly singular) solution of the Levi-flat Plateau problem for codimension 2 submanifolds that are CR images of \partial \Omega as above. The extension also holds locally near nondegenerate, holomorphically flat, elliptic CR singularities.
