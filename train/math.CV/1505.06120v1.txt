For an interval E=[a,b] on the real line, let \mu be either the equilibrium measure, or the normalized Lebesgue measure of E, and let V^{\mu} denote the associated logarithmic potential. In the present paper, we construct a function f which is analytic on E and possesses four branch points of second order outside of E such that the family of the admissible compacta of f has no minimizing elements with regard to the extremal theoretic-potential problem, in the external field equals V^{-\mu}.
