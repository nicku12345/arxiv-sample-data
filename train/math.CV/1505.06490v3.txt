In the present paper, questions about a local behavior of mappings f:D\rightarrow \overline{{\Bbb R}^n}, n\ge 2, in \overline{D} are studied. Under some conditions on a measurable function Q(x), Q:D\rightarrow [0, \infty], and boundaries of D and D^{\,\prime}=f(D), it is showed that a family of open discrete map\-ping f:D\rightarrow \overline{{\Bbb R}^n}, n\ge 2, with characteristic of quasiconformality Q(x), is equicontinuous in \overline{D}.
