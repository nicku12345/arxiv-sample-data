We investigate regularity properties of the \overline{\partial}-equation on domains in a complex euclidean space that depend on a parameter. Both the interior regularity and the regularity in the parameter are obtained for a continuous family of pseudoconvex domains. The boundary regularity and the regularity in the parameter are also obtained for smoothly bounded strongly pseudoconvex domains.
