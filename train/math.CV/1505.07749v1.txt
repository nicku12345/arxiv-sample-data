Let K={\bf R}^n\subset {\bf C}^n and Q(x):=\frac{1}{2}\log (1+x^2) where x=(x_1,...,x_n) and x^2 = x_1^2+\cdots +x_n^2. Utilizing extremal functions for convex bodies in {\bf R}^n\subset {\bf C}^n and Sadullaev's characterization of algebraicity for complex analytic subvarieties of {\bf C}^n we prove the following explicit formula for the weighted extremal function V_{K,Q}: V_{K,Q}(z)=\frac{1}{2}\log \bigl( [1+|z|^2] + \{ [1+|z|^2]^2-|1+z^2|^2\}^{1/2}) where z=(z_1,...,z_n) and z^2 = z_1^2+\cdots +z_n^2. As a corollary, we find that the Alexander capacity T_{\omega}({\bf R} {\bf P}^n) of {\bf R} {\bf P}^n is 1/\sqrt 2. We also compute the Monge-Amp\`ere measure of V_{K,Q}: (dd^cV_{K,Q})^n = n!\frac{1}{(1+x^2)^{\frac{n+1}{2}}}dx.
