Let \phi(x)=\sum \alpha_n x^n be a formal power series with real coefficients, and let D denote differentiation. It is shown that "for every real polynomial f there is a positive integer m_0 such that \phi(D)^mf has only real zeros whenever m\geq m_0" if and only if "\alpha_0=0 or 2\alpha_0\alpha_2 - \alpha_1^2 <0", and that if \phi does not represent a Laguerre-P\'olya function, then there is a Laguerre-P\'olya function f of genus 0 such that for every positive integer m, \phi(D)^mf represents a real entire function having infnitely many nonreal zeros.
