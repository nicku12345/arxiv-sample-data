In the article the authors consider the class {\mathcal H}_0 of sense-preserving harmonic functions f=h+\overline{g} defined in the unit disk |z|<1 and normalized so that h(0)=0=h'(0)-1 and g(0)=0=g'(0), where h and g are analytic in the unit disk. In the first part of the article we present two classes \mathcal{P}_H^0(\alpha) and \mathcal{G}_H^0(\beta) of functions from {\mathcal H}_0 and show that if f\in \mathcal{P}_H^0(\alpha) and F\in\mathcal{G}_H^0(\beta), then the harmonic convolution is a univalent and close-to-convex harmonic function in the unit disk provided certain conditions for parameters \alpha and \beta are satisfied. In the second part we study the harmonic sections (partial sums)  s_{n, n}(f)(z)=s_n(h)(z)+\overline{s_n(g)(z)},  where f=h+\overline{g}\in {\mathcal H}_0, s_n(h) and s_n(g) denote the n-th partial sums of h and g, respectively. We prove, among others, that if f=h+\overline{g}\in{\mathcal H}_0 is a univalent harmonic convex mapping, then s_{n, n}(f) is univalent and close-to-convex in the disk |z|< 1/4 for n\geq 2, and s_{n, n}(f) is also convex in the disk |z|< 1/4 for n\geq2 and n\neq 3. Moreover, we show that the section s_{3,3}(f) of f\in {\mathcal C}_H^0 is not convex in the disk |z|<1/4 but is shown to be convex in a smaller disk.
