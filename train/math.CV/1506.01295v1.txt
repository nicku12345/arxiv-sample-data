Let \mathcal M be a compact complex supermanifold. We prove that the set \mathrm{Aut}_{\bar 0}(\mathcal M) of automorphisms of \mathcal M can be endowed with the structure of a complex Lie group acting holomorphically on \mathcal M, so that its Lie algebra is isomorphic to the Lie algebra of even holomorphic super vector fields on \mathcal M. Moreover, we prove the existence of a complex Lie supergroup \mathrm{Aut}(\mathcal M) acting holomorphically on \mathcal M and satisfying a universal property. Its underlying Lie group is \mathrm{Aut}_{\bar 0}(\mathcal M) and its Lie superalgebra is the Lie superalgebra of holomorphic super vector fields on \mathcal M. This generalizes the classical theorem by Bochner and Montgomery that the automorphism group of a compact complex manifold is a complex Lie group. Some examples of automorphism groups of complex supermanifolds over \mathbb P_1(\mathbb C) are provided.
