We prove simultaneous universal Pad\'{e} approximation for several universal Pad\'{e} approximants of several types. Our results are generic in the space of holomorphic functions, in the space of formal power series as well as in a subspace of A^{\infty}. These results are valid for one center of expansion or for several centers as well.
