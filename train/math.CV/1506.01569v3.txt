In this paper, we generalize a recent work of Liu et al. from the open unit ball \mathbb B^n to more general bounded strongly pseudoconvex domains with C^2 boundary. It turns out that part of the main result in this paper is in some certain sense just a part of results in a work of Bracci and Zaitsev. However, the proofs are significantly different: the argument in this paper involves a simple growth estimate for the Carath\'eodory metric near the boundary of C^2 domains and the well-known Graham's estimate on the boundary behavior of the Carath\'eodory metric on strongly pseudoconvex domains, while Bracci and Zaitsev use other arguments.
