The paper deals with particular classes of q\times q matrix-valued functions which are holomorphic in \mathbb{C}\setminus[\alpha,+\infty), where \alpha is an arbitrary real number. These classes are generalizations of classes of holomorphic complex-valued functions studied by Kats and Krein [17] and by Krein and Nudelman [19]. The functions are closely related to truncated matricial Stieltjes problems on the interval [\alpha,+\infty). Characterizations of these classes via integral representations are presented. Particular emphasis is placed on the discussion of the Moore-Penrose inverse of these matrix-valued functions.
