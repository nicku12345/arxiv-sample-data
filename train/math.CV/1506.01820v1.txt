In this article, we consider an infinite type domain \Omega_P in \mathbb C^2. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the holomorphic vector fields tangent to an infinite type model in \mathbb C^2 vanishing at an infinite type point and to give an explicit description of the automorphism group of \Omega_P.
