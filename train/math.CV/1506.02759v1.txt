In previous work, the authors studied the compressed shift operators S_{z_1} and S_{z_2} on two-variable model spaces H^2(\mathbb{D}^2)\ominus \theta H^2(\mathbb{D}^2), where \theta is a two-variable scalar inner function. Among other results, the authors used Agler decompositions to characterize the ranks of the operators [S_{z_j}, S^*_{z_j}] in terms of the degree of rational \theta. In this paper, we examine similar questions for H^2(\mathbb{D}^2)\ominus \Theta H^2(\mathbb{D}^2) when \Theta is a matrix-valued inner function. We extend several results our previous work connecting \text{Rank} [S_{z_j}, S^*_{z_j}] and the degree of \Theta to the matrix setting. When results do not clearly generalize, we conjecture what is true and provide supporting examples.
