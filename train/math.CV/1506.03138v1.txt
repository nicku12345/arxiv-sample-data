Sufficient conditions on A, B, p, b and c are determined that will ensure the generalized Bessel functions {u}_{p,b,c} satisfies the subordination {u}_{p,b,c}(z) \prec (1+Az)/ (1+Bz). In particular this gives conditions for (-4\kappa/c)({u}_{p,b,c}(z)-1), c \neq 0 to be close-to-convex. Also, conditions for which {u}_{p,b,c}(z) to be Janowski convex, and z{u}_{p,b,c}(z) to be Janowski starlike in the unit disk \mathbb{D}=\{z \in \mathbb{C}: |z|<1\} are obtained.
