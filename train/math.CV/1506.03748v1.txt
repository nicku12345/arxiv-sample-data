We prove various representations and density results for Hardy spaces of holomorphic functions for two classes of bounded domains in \mathbb C^n, whose boundaries satisfy minimal regularity conditions (namely the classes C^2 and C^{1,1} respectively) together with naturally occurring notions of convexity.
