We determine all holomorphically separable complex manifolds of dimension p+q which admits a smooth envelope of holomorphy such that the general indefinite unitary group of size p+q acts effectively by holomorphic transformations. Also we give exact description of the automorphism groups of those complex manifolds. As an application we consider a characterization of those complex manifolds by their automorphism groups.
