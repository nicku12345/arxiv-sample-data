We are interested in the L^2-holomorphic automorphic functions on a g-dimensional complex space V^g_{\mathbb{C}} endowed with a positive definite hermitian form and associated to isotropic discrete subgroups \Gamma of rank 2\leq r \leq g. We show that they form an infinite reproducing kernel Hilbert space which looks like a tensor product of a theta Fock-Bargmann space on V^{r}_{\mathbb{C}}=Span_{\mathbb{C}}(\Gamma) and the classical Fock-Bargmann space on V^{g-r}_{\mathbb{C}}. Moreover, we provide an explicit orthonormal basis using Fourier series and we give the expression of its reproducing kernel function in terms of Riemann theta function of several variables with special characteristics.
