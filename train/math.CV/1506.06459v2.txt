Let X be a compact connected CR manifold of dimension 2n-1, n\geq 2 with a transversal CR S^1-action on X. We study the Fourier components of the Kohn-Rossi cohomology with respect to the S^1-action. By studying the Szeg\"o kernel of the Fourier components we establish the Morse inequalities on X. Using the Morse inequalities we have established on X we prove that there are abundant CR functions on X when X is weakly pseudoconvex and strongly pseudoconvex at a point.
