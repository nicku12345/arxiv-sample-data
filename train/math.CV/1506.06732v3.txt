Let M be a smooth manifold and \Phi a differential 1-form on M with values in the tangent bundle TM. We construct canonical solutions e_\Phi of Maurer-Cartan equation in the DGLA of graded derivations D*(M) of differential forms on M by means of deformations of d depending on \Phi. This yields to a classification of the canonical solutions of the Maurer-Cartan equation according to their type: e_\Phi is of finite type r if there exists r\in N such that \Phi^r[\Phi,\Phi]_{FN} = 0 and r is minimal with this property, where [.,.]_{FN} is the Fr\"olicher-Nijenhuis bracket. A distribution \xi\subset TM of codimension k > 1 is integrable if and only if the canonical solution e_\Phi associated to the endomorphism \Phi of TM which is trivial on \xi and equal to the identity on a complement of \xi in TM is of finite type \leq 1, respectively of finite type 0 if k = 1.
