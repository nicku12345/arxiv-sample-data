The connection formula for the Jackson integral of type BC_n is obtained in the form of a Sears--Slater type expansion of a bilateral multiple basic hypergeometric series as a linear combination of several specific bilateral multiple series. The coefficients of this expansion are expressed by certain elliptic Lagrange interpolation functions. Analyzing basic properties of the elliptic Lagrange interpolation functions, an explicit determinant formula is provided for a fundamental solution matrix of the associated system of q-difference equations.
