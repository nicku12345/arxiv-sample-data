Notions of a "holomorphic" function theory for functions of a split-quaternionic variable have been of recent interest. We describe two found in the literature and show that one notion encompasses a small class of functions, while the other gives a richer collection. In the second instance, we describe a simple subclass of functions and give two examples of an analogue of the Cauchy-Kowalewski extension in this context.
