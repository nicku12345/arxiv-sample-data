In this work we study the solutions of the equation z^pR(z^k)=\alpha with nonzero complex \alpha, integer p,k and R(z) generating a (possibly doubly infinite) totally positive sequence. It is shown that the zeros of z^pR(z^k)-\alpha are simple (or at most double in the case of real \alpha^k) and split evenly among the sectors \{\frac jk \pi\le\operatorname{Arg} z\le\frac {j+1}k \pi\}, j=0,\dots, 2k-1. Our approach rests on the fact that z(\ln z^{p/k}R(z) )' is an \mathcal R-function (i.e. maps the upper half of the complex plane into itself).   This result guarantees the same localization to zeros of entire functions f(z^k)+z^p g(z^k) and g(z^k)+z^{p}f(z^k) provided that f(z) and g(-z) have genus 0 and only negative zeros. As an application, we deduce that functions of the form \sum_{n=0}^\infty (\pm i)^{n(n-1)/2}a_n z^{n} have simple zeros distinct in absolute value under a certain condition on the coefficients a_n\ge 0. This includes the "disturbed exponential" function corresponding to a_n= q^{n(n-1)/2}/n! when 0<q\le 1, as well as the partial theta function corresponding to a_n= q^{n(n-1)/2} when 0<q\le q_*\approx 0.7457224107.
