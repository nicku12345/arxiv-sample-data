The notion of a complex tangent arises for embeddings of real manifolds into complex spaces. It is of particular interest when studying embeddings of real n-dimensional manifolds into \mathbb{C}^n. The generic topological structure of the set complex tangents to such embeddings M^n \hookrightarrow \mathbb{C}^n takes the form of a (stratified) (n-2)-dimensional submanifiold of M^n. In this paper, we generalize our results from our previous work for the 3-dimensional sphere and the Heisenberg group to obtain results regarding the possible topological configurations of the sets of complex tangents to embeddings of odd-dimensional spheres S^{2n-1} \hookrightarrow \mathbb{C}^{2n-1} by first considering the situation for the higher dimensional analogues of the Heisenberg group.
