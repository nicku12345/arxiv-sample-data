In this paper are discussed the results of new numerical experiments on zero distribution of type I Hermite-Pad\'e polynomials of order n=200 for three different collections of three functions [1,f_1,f_2]. These results are obtained by the authors numerically and do not match any of the theoretical results that were proven so far. We consider three simple cases of multivalued analytic functions f_1 and f_2, with separated pairs of branch points belonging to the real line. In the first case both functions have two logarithmic branch points, in the second case they both have branch points of second order, and finally, in the third case they both have branch points of third order.   All three cases may be considered as representative of the asymptotic theory of Hermite-Pad\'e polynomials. In the first two cases the numerical zero distribution of type I Hermite-Pad\'e polynomials are similar to each other, despite the different kind of branching. But neither the logarithmic case, nor the square root case can be explained from the asymptotic point of view of the theory of type I Hermite-Pad\'e polynomials.   The numerical results of the current paper might be considered as a challenge for the community of all experts on Hermite-Pad\'e polynomials theory.
