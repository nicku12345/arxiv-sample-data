We consider the systems of rational functions \{\Phi_n(z)\}, ~n \in \mathbb{Z}, defined by fixed set points {\bf a}:=\{a_k\}_{k=0}^{\infty}, ~ (\mathop{\rm Im} a_k>0), {\bf b}:=\{b_k\}_{k=1}^{\infty}, ~ (\mathop{\rm Im} b_k<0) and is orthonormal on the real axis \mathbb{R}. We have obtained the compact form of analogue of Dirichlet kernels of these systems on the real axis \mathbb{R}. Using obtained representation we investigate the problems of convergence in the spaces L_p(\mathbb{R}),~ p> 1, and pointwise convergence of Fourier series on the systems \{\Phi_n(t)\},~ n \in \mathbb{Z}, provided that the sequences of poles of these systems satisfies certain restrictions. We have proved statements that are analogues of the classical Theorems of Jordan-Dirichlet and Dini-Lipschitz of convergence of Fourier series on the trigonometric system.
