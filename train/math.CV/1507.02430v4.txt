We give a simple proof of the non-existence of limit E-Brody curves, in the sense of Do Duc Thai, Mai Anh Duc and Ninh Van Thu, for a class of manifolds including \mathbb{C}^n and (\mathbb{C}^{\ast})^2 which were studied by these authors in \cite{Do DT et al}, by constructing a suitable holomorphic interpolation function.
