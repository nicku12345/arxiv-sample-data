The new results concerning the continuity of holomorphically contractible systems treated as set functions with respect to non-monotonic sequences of sets are given. In particular, continuity properties of Kobayashi and Carath\'eodory pseudodistances, as well as Lempert and Green functions with respect to sequences of domains converging in Hausdorff metric are delivered.
