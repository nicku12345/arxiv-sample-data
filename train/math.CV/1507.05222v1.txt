Shifted and modulated Gaussian functions play a vital role in the representation of signals. We extend the theory into a quaternionic setting, using two exponential kernels with two complex numbers. As a final result, we show that every continuous and quaternion-valued signal f in the Wiener space can be expanded into a unique \ell^2 series on a lattice at critical density 1, provided one more point is added in the middle of a cell. We call that a relaxed Gabor expansion.
