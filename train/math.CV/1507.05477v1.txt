It was once conjectured that if A is a uniform algebra on its maximal ideal space X, and if each point of X is a peak point for A, then A = C(X). This peak-point conjecture was disproved by Brian Cole in 1968. Here we establish a peak-point theorem for uniform algebras generated by real-analytic functions on real-analytic varieties, generalizing previous results of the authors and John Wermer.
