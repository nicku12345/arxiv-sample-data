In our recent work [25] we showed that C^\infty CR-diffeomorphisms of real-analytic Levi-nonflat hypersurfaces in \mathbb C^{2} are not analytic in general. This result raised again the question on the nature of CR-maps of real-analytic hypersurfaces.   In this paper, we give a complete picture of what CR-maps actually are. First, we discover an analytic continuation phenomenon for CR-diffeomorphisms which we call the {\em sectorial analyticity property}. It appears to be the optimal regularity property for CR-diffeomorphisms in general. We emphasize that such type of extension never appeared previously in the literature. Second, we introduce the class of {\em Fuchsian type hypersurfaces} and prove that (infinitesimal generators of) CR-automorphisms of a Fuchsian type hypersurface are still analytic. In particular, this solves a problem formulated in [28].   Finally, we prove a regularity result for {\em formal} CR-automorphisms of Fuchsian type hypersurfaces.
