In this article, we establish a general sufficient condition for closed range of the Cauchy-Riemann operator \bar\partial in appropriately weighted L^2 and L^2-Sobolev spaces on (0,q)-forms for a fixed q on domains in \mathbb{C}^n. The domains we consider may be neither bounded nor pseudoconvex, and our condition is a generalization of the classical Z(q) condition that we call weak Z(q). We provide examples that explain the necessity of working in weighted spaces both for closed range in L^2 and even more critically, in L^2-Sobolev spaces.
