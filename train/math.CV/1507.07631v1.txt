A detailed, internal symmetry exists between individual terms n^{-s}, where n \in P is less than a particular value n_p, and sums over conjugate regions consisting of adjoining steps n greater than n_p. The boundaries of the conjugate regions are where first angle differences \delta \theta_n = -tlog((n+1)/n) equal odd multiples of \pi. Two significant points in the complex plane are defined by this symmetry: O'(s), conjugate to the origin O, and which equals \zeta(s) for \sigma \in (0,1); and P(s), conjugate to itself, which gives Riemann's correction to the discrete sum in the Riemann-Siegel equation. The distances from P to O and P to O' are equal only for \sigma = 1/2, where superposition of O and O' results under the single-parameter condition that \angle OP and \angle PO' are opposed. Analysis of this symmetry allows an alternate understanding of many of the results of number theory relating to \zeta (s), including its functional equation, analytic continuation, the Riemann-Siegel equation, and its zeros. Discussion of three explicit computational algorithms illustrates that the apparent peculiarity of the occurrence of zeros when \sigma = 1/2 is removed by direct recognition of the symmetry.
