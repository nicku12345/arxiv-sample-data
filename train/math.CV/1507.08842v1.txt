We study local rigidity properties of holomorphic embeddings of real hypersurfaces in \mathbb C^2 into real hypersurfaces in \mathbb C^3 and show that infinitesimal conditions imply actual local rigidity in a number of (important) cases. We use this to show that generic embeddings into a hyperquadric in \mathbb C^3 are locally rigid.
