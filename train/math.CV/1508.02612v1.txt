The question of existence of umbilical points, in the CR sense, on compact, three dimensional, strictly pseudoconvex CR manifolds was raised in the seminal paper by S.-S. Chern and J. K. Moser in 1974. In the present paper, we consider compact, three dimensional, strictly pseudoconvex CR manifolds that possess a free, transverse action by the circle group U(1). We show that every such CR manifold M has at least one orbit of umbilical points, {\it provided} that the Riemann surface X:=M/U(1) is not a torus. In particular, every compact, circular and strictly pseudoconvex hypersurface in \mathbb C^2 has at least one circle of umbilical points. The existence of umbilical points in the case where X is a torus is left open in general, but it is shown that if such an M has additional symmetries, in a certain sense, then it must possess umbilical points as well.
