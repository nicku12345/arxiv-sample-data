The k-Cauchy-Fueter operator  D_0^{(k) }  on one dimensional quaternionic space \mathbb{H} is the Euclidean version of helicity \frac k 2 massless field operator on the Minkowski space in physics. The k-Cauchy-Fueter equation for k\geq 2 is overdetermined and its compatibility condition is given by the k-Cauchy-Fueter complex. In quaternionic analysis, these complexes play the role of Dolbeault complex in several complex variables. We prove that a natural boundary value problem associated to this complex is regular. Then by using the theory of regular boundary value problems, we show the Hodge-type orthogonal decomposition, and the fact that the non-homogeneous k-Cauchy-Fueter equation  D_0^{(k) } u=f on a smooth domain \Omega in \mathbb{H} is solvable if and only if f satisfies the compatibility condition and is orthogonal to the set \mathscr H^1_{ (k) }(\Omega) of Hodge-type elements. This set is isomorphic to the first cohomology group of the k-Cauchy-Fueter complex over \Omega, which is finite dimensional, while the second cohomology group is always trivial.
