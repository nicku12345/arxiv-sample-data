For some class of mappings, there are investigated problems connected with a possibility of continuous extension to a boundary on Riemannian manifolds. In particular, for so-called ring mappings, there is proved a result related to continuous extension to an isolated boundary point. Besides that, similar theorems hold for more general boundaries. As application of developed technique, there is proves a theorem about continuous extension of mapping of Orlicz--Sobolev class to an isolated singularity.
