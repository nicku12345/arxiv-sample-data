This technical note describes the application of saddle-point integration to the asymptotic Fourier analysis of the well-known C_\infty "bump" function \exp[-(1-x^2)^{-1}], deriving both the asymptotic decay rate k^{-3/4} \exp(-\sqrt k) of the Fourier transform F(k) and the exact coefficient. The result is checked against brute-force numerical integration and is extended to generalizations of this bump function.
