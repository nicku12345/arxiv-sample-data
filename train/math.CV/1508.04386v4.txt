We prove precise growth and cancellation estimates for the Szeg\H{o} kernel of an unbounded model domain \Omega\subset\mathbb{C}^2 under the assumption that {\rm b}\Omega satisfies a uniform finite-type hypothesis. Such domains have smooth boundaries which are not algebraic varieties, and therefore admit no global homogeneities that allow one to use compactness arguments in order to obtain results. As an application of our estimates, we prove that the Szeg\H{o} projection \mathbb{S} of \Omega is exactly regular on the non-isotropic Sobolev spaces NL_k^p({\rm b}\Omega) for 1<p<+\infty and k=0,1,\ldots, and also that \mathbb{S}:\Gamma_\alpha (E)\rightarrow \Gamma_\alpha({\rm b}\Omega), for E\Subset {\rm b}\Omega and 0<\alpha<+\infty, with a bound that depends only on {\rm diam}(E), where \Gamma_\alpha are the non-isotropic H\"older spaces.
