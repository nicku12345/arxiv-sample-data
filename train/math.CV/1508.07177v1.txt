We study the rate of growth of entire functions that are distributionally irregular for the differentiation operator D. More specifically, given p \in [1,\infty ] and b \in (0,a), where a = \frac{1}{2 max\{2,p\}}, we prove that there exists a distributionally irregular entire function f for the operator D such that its p-integral mean function M_p(f,r) grows not more rapidly than e^r r^{-b}. This completes related known results about the possible rates of growth of such means for D-hypercyclic entire functions. It is also obtained the existence of dense linear submanifolds of H(C) all whose nonzero vectors are D-distributionally irregular and present the same kind of growth.
