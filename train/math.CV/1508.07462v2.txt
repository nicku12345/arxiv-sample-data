In this sequel to the recent work (see Azizi et al., 2015), we investigate a subclass of analytic and bi-univalent functions in the open unit disk. We obtain bounds for initial coefficients, the Fekete-Szeg\"o inequality and the second Hankel determinant inequality for functions belonging to this subclass. We also discuss some new and known special cases, which can be deduced from our results.
