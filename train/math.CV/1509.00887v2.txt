We study the local behavior of the closed-open discrete maps of Orlich--Sobolev classes in {\Bbb R}^n, n\geqslant 3. It was found that these mappings f have continuous extension in isolated point x_0 in D\setminus\{x_0 \}, as soon as their dilatation of order p\in (n-1, n]  has the majorant of class FMO at said point, and moreover, limits set of mapping f at x_0 and \partial D are disjoint.
