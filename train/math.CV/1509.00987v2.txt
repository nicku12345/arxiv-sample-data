In the present paper, we study regularity of the Andersson-Samuelsson Koppelman integral operator on affine cones over smooth projective complete intersections. Particularly, we prove L^p- and C^\alpha-estimates, and compactness of the operator, when the degree is sufficiently small. As applications, we obtain homotopy formulas for different \overline{\partial}-operators acting on L^p-spaces of forms, including the case p=2 if the varieties have canonical singularities. We also prove that the \mathcal{A}-forms introduced by Andersson-Samuelsson are C^\alpha for \alpha < 1.
