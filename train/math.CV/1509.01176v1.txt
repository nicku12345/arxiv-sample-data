The representation for the sharp constant {\rm K}_{n, p} in an estimate of the modulus of the n-th derivative of an analytic function in the upper half-plane {\mathbb C}_+ is considered. It is assumed that the boundary value of the real part of the function on \partial{\mathbb C}_+ belongs to L^p. The representation for {\rm K}_{n, p} comprises an optimization problem by parameter inside of the integral. This problem is solved for p=2(m+1)/(2m+1-n), n\leq 2m+1, and for some first derivatives of even order in the case p=\infty. The formula for {\rm K}_{n,\; 2(m+1)/(2m+1-n)} contains, for instance, the known expressions for {\rm K}_{2m+1, \infty} and {\rm K}_{m, 2} as particular cases. Also, a two-sided estimate for {\rm K}_{2m, \infty} is derived, which leads to the asymptotic formula {\rm K}_{2m, \infty}=2\big ((2m-1)!!\big )^2/\pi + O\big ( \big ((2m-1)!!\big )^2 /(2m-1)\big ) as m \rightarrow \infty . The lower and upper bounds of {\rm K}_{2m, \infty} are compared with its value for the cases m=1, 2, 3, 4. As applications, some real-part theorems with explicit constants for high order derivatives of analytic functions in subdomains of complex plane are described.
