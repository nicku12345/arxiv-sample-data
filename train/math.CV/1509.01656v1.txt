Let f be a real-valued real analytic function defined on an open set of \mathbb{R}^n. Then the complex power f_+^\lambda is defined as a distribution with a holomorphic parameter \lambda. We determine the annihilator (in the ring of differential operators) of each coefficient of the principal part of the Laurent expansion of f_+^\lambda about \lambda=-1 in case f=0 has a normal crossing singularity.
