In this paper, we provide {\em effective} results on the non-embeddability of real-analytic hypersurfaces into a hyperquadric. We show that, for any N >n \geq 1, the defining functions \varphi(z,\bar z,u) of all real-analytic hypersurfaces M=\{v=\varphi(z,\bar z,u)\}\subset\mathbb C^{n+1} containing Levi-nondegenerate points and locally transversally holomorphically embeddable into some hyperquadric \mathcal Q\subset\mathbb C^{N+1} satisfy an {\em universal} algebraic partial differential equation D(\varphi)=0, where the algebraic-differential operator D=D(n,N) depends on n, N only. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first effective result characterizing real-analytic hypersurfaces embeddable into a hyperquadric of higher dimension. As an application, we show that for every n,N as above there exists \mu=\mu(n,N) such that a Zariski generic real-analytic hypersurface M\subset\mathbb C^{n+1} of degree \geq \mu is not transversally holomorphically embeddable into any hyperquadric \mathcal Q\subset\mathbb C^{N+1}. We also provide an explicit upper bound for \mu in terms of n,N. To the best of our knowledge, this gives the first effective lower bound for the CR-complexity of a Zariski generic real-algebraic hypersurface in complex space of a fixed degree.
