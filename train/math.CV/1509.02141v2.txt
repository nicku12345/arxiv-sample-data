Answering a question of A.Zygmund in \cite{MR} G.MacLane and L.Rubel described boundedness of L_2-norm w.r.t. the argument of \log |B|, where B is a Blaschke product. We generalize their results in several directions. We describe growth of pth means, p\in(1, \infty), of subharmonic functions bounded from above in the unit disc. Necessary and sufficient conditions are formulated in terms of the complete measure (of a subharmonic function) in the sense of A.Grishin. We also prove sharp estimates of the growth of pth means of analytic and subharmonic functions of finite order in the unit disc.
