Let \Omega  be any set in the complex plane \mathbb{C}, and let \psi:\ \mathbb{C}^3\times \mathbb{D}\to \mathbb{C}. Let p be a complex-valued harmonic function in the unit disc \mathbb{D} of the form p = p_1 + \overline{p_2}, where p_1 and p_2 are analytic in \mathbb{D}. In this article we consider the problem of determining properties of the function p, such that p satisfies the differential subordination \psi (p(z),Dp(z), D^2p(z);z)\subset \Omega \Rightarrow p(\mathbb{D})\subset \Delta .
