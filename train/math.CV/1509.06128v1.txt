In this paper we prove the result: Let \mathcal{F} be a family of meromorphic functions on a domain \Omega such that every pair of members of \mathcal{F} shares a set S:=\left\{\psi_1(z), \psi_2(z), \psi_3(z) \right\} in \Omega, where \psi_j(z), \ j=1,2,3 is meromorphic in \Omega. If for every f\in \mathcal{F}, f(z_0)\neq \psi_i (z_0) whenever \psi_i(z_0)=\psi_j(z_0) for i,j\in \left\{1,2,3 \right\}(i\neq j) and z_0\in \Omega , then \mathcal{F} is normal in \Omega. This result generalizes a result of M.Fang and W.Hong [Some results on normal family of meromorphic functions, Bull. Malays. Math. Sci. Soc. (2)23 (2000),143-151,] and in particular, it generalizes the most celebrated theorem of Montel-the Montel's theorem.
