In this paper we are concerned with the problem of completeness in the Bergman space of the worm domain \mathcal{W}_\mu and its truncated version \mathcal{W}'_\mu. We determine some orthogonal systems and show that they are not complete, while showing that the union of two particular of such systems is complete.   In order to prove our completeness result we introduce the Muentz-Szasz problem for the 1-dimensional Bergman space of the disk \{\zeta : |\zeta-1|<1\} and find a sufficient condition for its solution.
