In this paper we continue our earlier investigations on normal families of meromorphic functions\cite{CS2}. Here, we prove some value distribution results which lead to some normality criteria for a family of meromorphic functions involving the sharing of a holomorphic function by more general differential polynomials generated by members of the family and get some recently known results extended and improved. In particular, the main result of this paper leads to a counterexample to the converse of Bloch's principle.
