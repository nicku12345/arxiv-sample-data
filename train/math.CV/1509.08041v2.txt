It is shown that if A is a uniform algebra generated by real-analytic functions on a suitable compact subset K of a real-analytic variety such that the maximal ideal space of A is K, and every continuous function on K is locally a uniform limit of functions in A, then A=C(K). This gives an affirmative answer to a special case of a question from the Proceedings of the Symposium on Function Algebras held at Tulane University in 1965.
