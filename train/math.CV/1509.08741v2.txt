We derive a necessary condition for compactness of the weighted \overline\partial-Neumann operator on the space L^2(\mathbb C^n,e^{-\varphi}), under the assumption that the corresponding weighted Bergman space of entire functions has infinite dimension. Moreover, we compute the essential spectrum of the complex Laplacian for decoupled weights, \varphi(z) = \varphi_1(z_1) + \dotsb + \varphi_n(z_n), and investigate (non-) compactness of the \overline\partial-Neumann operator in this case. More can be said if every \Delta\varphi_j defines a nontrivial doubling measure.
