We study two geometric properties of reproducing kernels in model spaces K\_\thetawhere \theta is an inner function in the disc: overcompleteness and existence of uniformly minimalsystems of reproducing kernels which do not contain Riesz basic sequences. Both of these properties are related to the notion of the Ahern--Clark point. It is shown that "uniformly minimal non-Riesz"  sequences of reproducing kernelsexist near each Ahern--Clark point which is not an analyticity point for \theta, whileovercompleteness may occur only near the Ahern--Clark points of infinite orderand is equivalent to a "zero localization property". In this context the notion ofquasi-analyticity appears naturally, and as a by-product of our results we give conditions in thespirit of Ahern--Clark for the restriction of a model space to a radius to be a class ofquasi-analyticity.
