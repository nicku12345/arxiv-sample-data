It is proved the existence of nonclassical solutions of the Neumann problem for the harmonic functions in the Jordan rectifiable domains with arbitrary measurable boundary distributions of normal derivatives. The same is stated for the partial case of the Poincare problem on directional derivatives. Moreover, it is shown that the spaces of the found solutions have the infinite dimension.
