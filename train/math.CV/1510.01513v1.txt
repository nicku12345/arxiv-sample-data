It is proved the existence of single-valued analytic solutions in the unit disk and multivalent analytic solutions in domains bounded by a finite collection of circles for the Riemann-Hilbert problem with coefficients of sigma-finite variation and with boundary data that are measurable with respect to logarithmic capacity. It is shown that these spaces of solutions have the infinite dimension.
