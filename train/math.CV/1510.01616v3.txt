Let w be an unbounded radial weight on the complex plane. We study the following approximation problem: find a proper holomorphic map f: \mathbb{C}\to\mathbb{C}^n such that |f| is equivalent to w. We give several characterizations of those w for which the problem is solvable. In particular, a constructive characterization is given in terms of tropical power series. Moreover, the following natural objects and properties are involved: essential weights on the complex plane, approximation by power series with positive coefficients, approximation by the maximum of a holomorphic function modulus. Extensions to several complex variables and approximation by harmonic maps are also considered.
