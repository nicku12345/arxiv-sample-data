In this work, we obtain an unexpected geometric characterization of sphericity of a real-analytic Levi-nondegenerate hypersurface M\subset\mathbb C^{2}. We prove that M is spherical if and only if its Segre\,(-Webster) varieties satisfy an elementary combinatorial property, identical to a property of straight lines on the plane and known in Projective Geometry as the {\em Desargues Theorem}.
