In this paper, we use Takeuchi's Theorem to show that for every Lipschitz pseudoconvex domain \Omega in \mathbb{CP}^n there exists a Lipschitz defining function \rho and an exponent 0<\eta<1 such that -(-\rho)^\eta is strictly plurisubharmonic on \Omega. This generalizes a result of Ohsawa and Sibony for C^2 domains. In contrast to the Ohsawa-Sibony result, we provide a counterexample demonstrating that we may not assume \rho=-\delta, where \delta is the geodesic distance function for the boundary of \Omega.
