In this paper, we obtain a new characterization for univalent harmonic mappings and obtain a structural formula for the associated function which defines the analytic \Phi-like functions in the unit disk. The new criterion stated in this article for the injectivity of harmonic mappings implies the well-known results of Kas'yanyuk \cite{Kas59} and Brickman \cite{Brick73} for analytic functions, but with a simpler proof than theirs. A number of consequences of the characterization, and examples are also presented. Further investigation provides a new method to construct univalent harmonic mappings with the help of an improved distortion theorem.
