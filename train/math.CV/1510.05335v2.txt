In this paper, we study the real hypersurfaces M in \mathbb C^2 at points p\in M of infinite type. The degeneracy of M at p is assumed to be the least possible, namely such that the Levi form vanishes to first order in the CR transversal direction. A new phenomenon, compared to known normal forms in other cases, is the presence of resonances as roots of an universal polynomial in the 7-jet of the defining function of M. The main result is a complete (formal) normal form at points p with no resonances. Remarkably, our normal form at such infinite type points resembles closely the Chern-Moser normal form at Levi-nondegenerate points. For a fixed hypersurface, its normal forms are parametrized by S^1\times \mathbb R^*, and as a corollary we find that the automorphisms in the stability group of M at p without resonances are determined by their 1-jets at p. In the last section, as a contrast, we also give examples of hypersurfaces with arbitrarily high resonances that possess families of distinct automorphisms whose jets agree up to the resonant order.
