Recall that the Hilbert (Riemann-Hilbert) boundary value problem was recently solved in \cite{R1} for arbitrary measurable coefficients and for arbitrary measurable boundary data in terms of nontangential limits and principal asymptotic values. Here it is developed a new approach making possible to obtain new results on tangential limits. It is shown that the spaces of the found solutions have the infinite dimension for prescribed collections of Jordan arcs terminating in almost every boundary point. Similar results are proved for the Riemann problem.
