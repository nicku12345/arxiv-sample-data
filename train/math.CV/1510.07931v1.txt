It is a consequence of the Jacobi Inversion Theorem that a line bundle over a Riemann surface M of genus g has a meromorphic section having at most g poles, or equivalently, the divisor class of a divisor D over M contains a divisor having at most g poles (counting multiplicities). We explore various analogues of these ideas for vector bundles and associated matrix divisors over M. The most explicit results are for the genus 1 case. We also review and improve earlier results concerning the construction of automorphic or relatively automorphic meromorphic matrix functions having a prescribed null/pole structure.
