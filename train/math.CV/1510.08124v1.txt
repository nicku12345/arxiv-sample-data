We study the lemniscates of rational maps. We prove a reflection principle for the harmonic measure of rational lemniscates and we give estimates for their capacity and the capacity of their components. Also, we prove a version of Schwarz's lemma for the capacity of the lemniscates of proper holomorphic functions.
