For a compact real form U of a complex simple Lie group G, and an irreducible representation \rho:\Gamma \to U of a Fuchsian group of the first kind \Gamma, it is shown that the classical isomorphism of Shimura, for the periods of a cusp form of weight 2 with values in \mathfrak{g} and the representation \textrm{Ad}\rho:\Gamma\to\textrm{Aut}\mathfrak{g}, can be interpreted as the differential at a point of the zero section, for a natural map from the cotangent bundle of the moduli space of certain (\Gamma, G)-bundles over \mathbb{H} (in the sense of Seshadri) to an open set in the smooth locus of the character variety \textrm{Hom}_{\mathbf{t}}(\Gamma,G)/PG. Emphasis is put on analytic techniques.
