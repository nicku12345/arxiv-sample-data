In this paper we examine the existence of bicomplexified inverse Fourier transform as an extension of its complexified inverse version within the region of convergence of bicomplex Fourier transform. In this paper we use the idempotent representation of bicomplex-valued functions as projections on the auxiliary complex spaces of the components of bicomplex numbers along two orthogonal,idempotent hyperbolic directions.
