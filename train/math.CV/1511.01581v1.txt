In this paper, by making use of a certain family of fractional derivative operators in the complex domain, we introduce and investigate a new subclass \mathcal{P}_{\tau,\mu}(k,\delta,\gamma) of analytic and univalent functions in the open unit disk \mathbb{U}. In particular, for functions in the class \mathcal{P}_{\tau,\mu}(k,\delta,\gamma), we derive sufficient coefficient inequalities, distortion theorems involving the above-mentioned fractional derivative operators, and the radii of starlikeness and convexity. In addition, some applications of functions in the class \mathcal{P}_{\tau,\mu}(k,\delta,\gamma) are also pointed out.
