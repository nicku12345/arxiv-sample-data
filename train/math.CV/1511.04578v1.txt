Hyperbolic geometry plays an important role within function theory of the disk. For example, via the Schwarz-Pick Lemma, the isometries of the unit disk \mathbb D with respect to this geometry are the conformal self-maps of \mathbb D. In this elementary classroom note, we are interested in the collection of the pseudohyperbolic disks D_\rho(x,r) (with fixed radius r and variable hyperbolic centers -1<x<1) and determine explicitely with function theoretic tools the enveloppe of these disks.
