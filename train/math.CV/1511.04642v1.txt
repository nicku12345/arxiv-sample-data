Let f(z)=h(z)+\overline{g(z)} be a harmonic mapping of the unit disk U. In this paper, the sharp coefficient estimates for bounded planar harmonic mappings are established, the sharp coefficient estimates for normalized planar harmonic mappings with |h(z)|+|g(z)|\leq M are also provided. As their applications, Landau's theorems for certain biharmonic mappings are provided, which improve and refine the related results of earlier authors.
