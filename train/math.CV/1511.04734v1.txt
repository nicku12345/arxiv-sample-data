This paper is devoted to the study of semigroups of composition operators and semigroups of holomorphic mappings. We establish conditions under which these semigroups can be extended in their parameter to sector given a priori. We show that the size of this sector can be controlled by the image properties of the infinitesimal generator, or, equivalently, by the geometry of the so-called associated planar domain. We also give a complete characterization of all composition operators acting on the Hardy space H^p on the right half-plane.
