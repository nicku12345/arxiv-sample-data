On complete pseudoconvex Reinhardt domains in \mathbb{C}^2, we show that there is no nonzero Hankel operator with an anti-holomorphic symbol that is Hilbert-Schmidt. We also present examples of unbounded non-pseudoconvex domains that admit nonzero Hilbert-Schmidt Hankel operators with anti-holomorphic symbols.
