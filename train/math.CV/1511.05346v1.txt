Known properties of Chebyshev polynomials are the following: they have simple critical points with only two (finite) critical values. Those properties uniquely determine the named polynomials modulo affine transformations of dependent and independent variables. A similar property of Zolotarev fractions: simple critical points and only four critical values generates already many classes of rational functions modulo projective transformations of their dependent and independent variables. They are listed in this note.
