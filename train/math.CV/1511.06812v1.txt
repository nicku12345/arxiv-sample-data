In this paper we give a detailed proof that the Milnor fiber X_t of an analytic complex isolated singularity function defined on a reduced n-equidimensional analytic complex space X is a regular neighborhood of a polyhedron P_t \subset X_t of real dimension n-1. Moreover, we describe the degeneration of X_t onto the special fiber X_0, by giving a continuous collapsing map \Psi_t: X_t \to X_0 which sends P_t to \{0\} and which restricts to a homeomorphism X_t \backslash P_t \to X_0 \backslash \{0\}.
