In this paper, we first establish several general sufficient conditions for the biholomorphic convex mappings on the bounded convex balanced domain D_{p}^n(p_{j}\geq 2,j=1,\cdots,n) in C^{n}, which extend some related results of earlier authors. From these, some concrete examples of biholomorphic convex mappings on D_{p}^n are also provided.
