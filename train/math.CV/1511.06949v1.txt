In this paper, we first obtain several sharp inequalities of homogeneous expansion for both the subclass of all normalized biholomorphic quasi-convex mappings of type B and order alpha and the subclass of all normalized biholomorphic almost starlike mappings of order alpha defined on the unit ball B of a complex Banach space X. Then, with these sharp inequalities, we derive the sharp estimates of the third and fourth homogeneous expansions for the above mappings defined on the unit polydisk D^n in C(n).
