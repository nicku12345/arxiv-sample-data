The article deals with the class {\mathcal F}_{\alpha } consisting of non-vanishing functions f that are analytic and univalent in \ID such that the complement \IC\backslash f(\ID)  is a convex set, f(1)=\infty , f(0)=1 and the angle at \infty  is less than or equal to \alpha \pi , for some \alpha \in (1,2]. Related to this class is the class CO(\alpha) of concave univalent mappings in \ID, but this differs from {\mathcal F}_{\alpha } with the standard normalization f(0)=0=f'(0)=1. A number of properties of these classes are discussed which includes an easy proof of the coefficient conjecture for CO(2) settled by Avkhadiev et al. \cite{Avk-Wir-04}. Moreover, another interesting result connected with the Yamashita conjecture on Dirichlet finite integral for CO(\alpha) is also presented.
