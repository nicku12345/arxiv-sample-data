The goal of this note is to explore the relationship between the Folland-Kohn basic estimate and the Z(q)-condition. In particular, on unbounded pseudoconvex (resp., pseudoconcave) domains, we prove that the Folland-Kohn basic estimate is equivalent to uniform strict pseudoconvexity (resp., pseudoconcavity). As a corollary, we observe that despite the Siegel upper half space being strictly pseudoconvex and biholomorphic to a the unit ball, it fails to satisfy uniform strict pseudoconvexity and hence the Folland-Kohn basic estimate fails.   On unbounded non-pseudoconvex domains, we show that the Folland-Kohn basic estimate on (0,q)-forms implies a uniform Z(q) condition, and conversely, that a uniform Z(q) condition with some additional hypotheses implies the Folland-Kohn basic estimate for (0,q)-forms.
