In the present paper, we will discuss the Hankel determinants H(f) =a_2a_4-a_3^2 of order 2 for normalized concave functions f(z)=z+a_2z^2+a_3z^3+\dots with a pole at p\in(0,1). Here, a meromorphic function is called concave if it maps the unit disk conformally onto a domain whose complement is convex. To this end, we will characterize the coefficient body of order 2 for the class of analytic functions \varphi(z) on |z|<1 with |\varphi|<1 and \varphi(p)=p. We believe that this is helpful for other extremal problems concerning a_2, a_3, a_4 for normalized concave functions with a pole at p.
