In this paper, we study analytic and geometric properties of the solution q(z) to the differential equation q(z)+zq'(z)/q(z)=h(z) with the initial condition q(0)=1 for a given analytic function h(z) on the unit disk |z|<1 in the complex plane with h(0)=1. In particular, we investigate the possible largest constant c>0 such that the condition |\Im[zf"(z)/f'(z)]|<c on |z|<1 implies starlikeness of an analytic function f(z) on |z|<1 with f(0)=f'(0)-1=0.
