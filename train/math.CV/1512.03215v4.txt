Let (Z,d,\mu) be a compact, connected, Ahlfors Q-regular metric space with Q>1. Using a hyperbolic filling of Z, we define the notions of the p-capacity between certain subsets of Z and of the weak covering p-capacity of path families \Gamma in Z. We show comparability results and quasisymmetric invariance. As an application of our methods we deduce a result due to Tyson on the geometric quasiconformality of quasisymmetric maps between compact, connected Ahlfors Q-regular metric spaces.
