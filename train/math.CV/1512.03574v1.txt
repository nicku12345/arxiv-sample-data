For mappings in metric spaces satisfying one inequality with respect to modulus of families of curves, there is proved a lightness of preimage under the mapping. It is proved that, the mappings, satisfying estimate mentioned above, are light, whenever a function which corresponds to distortion of families of curves under the mapping, is of finite mean oscillation at every point.
