Consider the Dirichlet-type space on the bidisk consisting of holomorphic functions f(z_1,z_2):=\sum_{k,l\geq 0}a_{kl}z_1^kz_2^l such that \sum_{k,l\geq 0}(k+1)^{\alpha_1} (l+1)^{\alpha_2}|a_{kl}|^2 <\infty. Here the parameters \alpha_1,\alpha_2 are arbitrary real numbers. We characterize the polynomials that are cyclic for the shift operators on this space. More precisely, we show that, given an irreducible polynomial p(z_1,z_2) depending on both z_1 and z_2 and having no zeros in the bidisk: if \alpha_1+\alpha_2\leq 1, then p is cyclic; if \alpha_1+\alpha_2>1 and \min\{\alpha_1,\alpha_2\}\leq 1, then p is cyclic if and only if it has finitely many zeros in the two-torus \mathbb T^2; if \min\{\alpha_1,\alpha_2\}>1, then p is cyclic if and only if it has no zeros in \mathbb T^2.
