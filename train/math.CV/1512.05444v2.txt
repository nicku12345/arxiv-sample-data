A finite Blaschke product is a product of finitely many automorphisms of the unit disk. This brief survey covers some of the main topics in the area, including characterizations of finite Blaschke products, approximation theorems, derivatives and residues of finite Blaschke products, geometric localization of zeros, and selected other topics.
