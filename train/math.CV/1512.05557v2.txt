For entire Dirichlet series of the form F(z)=\sum\limits_{n=0}^{+\infty} a_{n}e^{z\lambda_n},\ 0\le\lambda_n\uparrow+\infty\ (n\to+\infty), we establish conditions under which the relation  F(x+iy)=(1+o(1))a_{\nu(x,F)}e^{(x+iy)\lambda_{\nu(x,F)}}  is true as x\to+\infty outside some set E such that \text{ h-meas }(E)=\int_{E}dh(x)<+\infty uniformly in y\in\Bbb{R}, where h(x) is positive continuous function increasing to +\infty on [0,+\infty) with non-decreasing to +\infty derivative.
