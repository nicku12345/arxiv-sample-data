We first investigate the Lipschitz continuity of (K, K')-quasiregular C^2 mappings between two Jordan domains with smooth boundaries, satisfying certain partial differential inequalities concerning Laplacian. Then two applications of the obtained result are given: As a direct consequence, we get the Lipschitz continuity of \rho-harmonic (K, K')-quasiregular mappings, and as the other application, we study the Lipschitz continuity of (K,K')-quasiconformal self-mappings of the unit disk, which are the solutions of the Poisson equation \Delta w=g. These results generalize and extend several recently obtained results by Kalaj, Mateljevi\'{c} and Pavlovi\'{c}.
