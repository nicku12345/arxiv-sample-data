It is known that, generically, Taylor series of functions holomorphic in the unit disc turn out to be universal series outside of the unit disc and in particular on the unit circle. Due to classical and recent results on the boundary behaviour of Taylor series, for functions in Hardy spaces and Bergman spaces the situation is essentially different. In this paper it is shown that in many respects these results are sharp in the sense that universality generically appears on maximal exceptional sets. As a main tool it is proved that the Taylor (backward) shift on certain Bergman spaces is mixing.
