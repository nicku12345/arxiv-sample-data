Let F be an entire function represented by absolutely convergent for all z\in\mathbb{C} Dirichlet series of the form  F(z) = \sum\nolimits_{n=0}^{+\infty} a_{n}e^{z\lambda_{n}},\ where a sequence (\lambda_n) such that \lambda_n\in\mathbb{R}\ \ (n\geq0), \lambda_n\not=\lambda_k for any n\not=k and (\forall n\geq 0):\ 0\leq\lambda_n<\beta:=\sup\{\lambda_j:\ j\geq0\}\leq +\infty. {Let h be non-decrease positive continuous function on [0,+\infty) and \Phi increase positive continuous on [0,+\infty) function.}   In this paper we {find} the condition {on} (\mu_n) and (\lambda_n) {such that} the relation F(x+iy)=(1+o(1))a_{\nu(x, F)}e^{(x+iy)\lambda_{\nu(x, F)}}  holds as   x\to +\infty\ outside some set E of finite logarithmic h-measure uniformly in y\in\mathbb{R}.
