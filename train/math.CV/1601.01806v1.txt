Answering all questions---concerning proper holomorphic mappings between generalized Hartogs triangles---posed by Jarnicki and Plfug (First steps in several complex variables: Reinhardt domains, 2008) we characterize the existence of proper holomorphic mappings between generalized Hartogs triangles and give their explicit form. In particular, we completely describe the group of holomorphic automorphisms of such domains and establish rigidity of proper holomorphic self-mappings on them.
