In this paper, we introduce and investigate a new subclass of the function class \Sigma of bi-univalent functions defined in the open unit disk, which are associated with the Hurwitz-Lerch zeta function, satisfying quasi-subordinate conditions. Furthermore, we find estimates on the Taylor-Maclaurin coefficients |a_2| and |a_3| for functions in this new subclass. Several (known or new) consequences of the results are also pointed out.
