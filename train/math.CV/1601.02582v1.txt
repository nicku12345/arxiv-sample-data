This paper investigates the location of the zeros of a sequence of polynomials generated by a rational function with a binomial-type denominator. We show that every member of a two-parameter family consisting of such generating functions gives rise to a sequence of polynomials \{P_{m}(z)\}_{m=0}^{\infty} that is eventually hyperbolic. Moreover, the real zeros of the polynomials P_{m}(z) form a dense subset of an interval I\subset\mathbb{R}^{+}, whose length depends on the particular values of the parameters in the generating function.
