We study a characterization of slice Carleson measures and of Carleson measures for the both the Hardy spaces H^p(\mathbb B) and the Bergman spaces \mathcal A^p(\mathbb B) of the quaternionic unit ball \mathbb B. In the case of Bergman spaces, the characterization is done in terms of the axially symmetric completion of a pseudohyperbolic disc in a complex plane. We also show that a characterization in terms of pseudohyperbolic balls is not possible.
