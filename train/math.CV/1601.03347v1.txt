The paper deals with an extremal problem for bounded harmonic functions in the unit ball of \mathbf{R}^4. We solve the generalized Khavinson problem in \mathbf{R}^4. This precise problem was formulated by G. Kresin and V. Maz'ya for harmonic functions in the unit ball and in the half--space of \mathbf{R}^n. We find the optimal pointwise estimates for the norm of the gradient of bounded real--valued harmonic functions.
