A boundary behavior of closed open discrete mappings of Sobolev and Orlicz--Sobolev classes in {\Bbb R}^n, n\ge 3, is studied. It is proved that, mappings mentioned above have a continuous extension to boundary point x_0 of a domain D whenever its inner dilatation of order p has a majorant FMO (finite mean oscillation) at the point. Another sufficient condition of possibility of continuous extension is a divergence of some integral.
