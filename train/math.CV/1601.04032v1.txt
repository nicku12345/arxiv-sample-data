Based on the so-called re-scaling method, we will give a detailed description of the solutions to the Hamiltonian system (\ref{Hsystem}) below, which was discovered only recently by Kecker, and is strongly related to Painleve's fourth differential equation. In particular, the problem to determine those fourth Painleve transcendents with positive Nevanlinna deficiency \delta(0,w), is completely resolved.
