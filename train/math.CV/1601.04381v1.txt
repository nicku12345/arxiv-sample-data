For any rational functions with complex coefficients A(z), B(z) and C(z), where A(z), C(z) are not identically zero, we consider the sequence of rational functions H_{m}(z) with generating function \sum H_{m}(z)t^{m}=1/(A(z)t^{2}+B(z)t+C(z)). We provide an explicit formula for the limiting pair correlation function of the roots of \prod_{m=0}^{n}H_{m}(z), as n\rightarrow\infty, counting multiplicities, on certain closed subarcs J of a curve \mathcal{C} where the roots lie. We give an example where the limiting pair correlation function does not exist if J contains the endpoints of \mathcal{C}.
