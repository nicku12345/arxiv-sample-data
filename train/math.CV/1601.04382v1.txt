Let H_{m}(z) be a sequence of polynomials whose generating function \sum_{m=0}^{\infty}H_{m}(z)t^{m} is the reciprocal of a bivariate polynomial D(t,z). We show that in the three cases D(t,z)=1+B(z)t+A(z)t^{2}, D(t,z)=1+B(z)t+A(z)t^{3} and D(t,z)=1+B(z)t+A(z)t^{4}, where A(z) and B(z) are any polynomials in z with complex coefficients, the roots of H_{m}(z) lie on a portion of a real algebraic curve whose equation is explicitly given. The proofs involve the q-analogue of the discriminant, a concept introduced by Mourad Ismail.
