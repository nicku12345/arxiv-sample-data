For any fixed positive integer n, we study the root distribution of a sequence of polynomials H_{m}(z) satisfying the rational generating function \[ \sum_{m=0}^{\infty}H_{m}(z)t^{m}=\frac{1}{1+B(z)t+A(z)t^{n}} \] where A(z) and B(z) are any polynomials in z with complex coefficients. We show that the roots of H_{m}(z) which satisfy A(z)\ne0 lie on a specific fixed real algebraic curve for all large m.
