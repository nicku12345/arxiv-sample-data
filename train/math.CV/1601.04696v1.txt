The paper studies entire functions of finite order of growth for which a representation of the form \psi(z) = 1+ O(|z|^{-\mu}), \mu >0, as z\to \infty, is valid on a fixed ray of the complex plane. The main result is the following. Assume that the zeros of two functions \psi_1, \psi_2 of this class coincide in the circle of radius R with the center in zero. Then given arbitrary small \delta\in (0,1) and \varepsilon >0 the relation of these functions admits the estimate |\psi_1(z)/\psi_2(z) -1| \leqslant \varepsilon R^{-\mu(1-\delta)} for all |z|\leqslant R^{1-\delta}, provided that R\geqslant R_0 and R_0 =R_0(\varepsilon, \delta) is sufficiently large.   This result is of considerable interest in the analysis of the stability in the inverse resonance problem for the Schroedinger equation.
