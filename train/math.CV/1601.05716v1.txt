Let c\in \mathbb{C}^{m}, f:\mathbb{C}^{m}\rightarrow\mathbb{P}^{n}(\mathbb{C}) be a linearly nondegenerate meromorphic mapping over the field \mathcal{P}_{c} of c-periodic meromorphic functions in \mathbb{C}^{m}, and let H_{j} (1\leq j\leq q) be q(>2N-n+1) hyperplanes in N-subgeneral position of \mathbb{P}^{n}(\mathbb{C}). We prove a new version of the second main theorem for meromorphic mappings of hyperorder strictly less than one without truncated multiplicity by considering the Casorati determinant of f instead of its Wronskian determinant. As its applications, we obtain a defect relation, a uniqueness theorem and a difference analogue of generalized Picard theorem.
