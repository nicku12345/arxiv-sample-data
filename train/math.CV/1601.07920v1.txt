In this article we study the inclusion properties of the Bessel-Struve kernel functions in the Janowski class. In particular, we find the conditions for which the Bessel-Struve kernel functions maps the unit disk to right half plane. An open problem in this aspect are also given. The third order differential subordination involving the Bessel-Struve kernel is also considered. The results are derived by defining suitable classes of admissible functions. One of the recurrence relation of the Bessel-Struve kernel play an important role to derive the main results.
