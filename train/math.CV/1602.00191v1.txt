This article deals with the multiple values and algebraic dependences problem of meromorphic mappings sharing moving hyperplanes in projective space. We give some algebraic dependences theorems for meromorphic mappings sharing moving hyperplanes without counting multiplicity, where all zeros with multiplicities more than a certain number are omitted. Basing on these results, some unicity theorems regardless of multiplicity for meromorphic mappings in several complex variables are given. These results are extensions and strong improvements of some recent results.
