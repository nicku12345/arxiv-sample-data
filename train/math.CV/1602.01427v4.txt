We generalize to intersection of strictly c -convex domains in Stein manifold,  L^{r}-L^{s} and Lipschitz estimates for the solutions of the  \bar \partial  equation done by Ma and Vassiliadou for domains in  {\mathbb{C}}^{n}. For this we use a Docquier-Grauert holomorphic retraction plus the raising steps method I introduce earlier. This gives results in the case of domains with low regularity,  {\mathcal{C}}^{3}, for their boundary.
