Some of my previous publications were incomplete in the sense that non trivial zeros belonging to a particular type of fundamental domain have been inadvertently ignored. Due to this fact, I was brought to believe that computations done by some authors in order to show counterexamples to RH were affected of approximation errors. In this paper I illustrate graphically the correctness of those computations and I fill the gaps in my publications.
