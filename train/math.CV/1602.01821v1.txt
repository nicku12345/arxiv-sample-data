We consider the problem of sampling in de Branges spaces and develop some necessary conditions and some sufficient conditions for sampling sequences, which generalize some well-known sampling results in the Paley-Wiener space. These conditions are obtained by identifying the main construction with Naimark dilation of frames--embedding the de Branges space into a larger de Branges space while embedding the kernel functions associated with a sampling sequence into a Riesz basis for the larger space.
