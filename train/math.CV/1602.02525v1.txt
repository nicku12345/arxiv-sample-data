We call a subset K of \mathbb C \emph{biholomorphically homogeneous} if for any two points p,q\in K there exists a neighborhood U of p and a biholomorphism \psi:U\to \psi(U)\subset \mathbb C such that \psi(p)=q and \psi(K\cap U)= K\cap \psi(U). We show that a biholomorphically homogeneous smooth curve \gamma\subset \mathbb C is necessarily real-analytic. Furthermore we show that the same holds for the homogeneity with respect of a wider class of groups G of real-analytic transformations of the plane. The result also extends to subsets K\subset \mathbb R^2 which are just locally closed.
