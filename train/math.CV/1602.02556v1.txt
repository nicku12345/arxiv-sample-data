In this present paper we study geometry of compact complex manifolds equipped with a \emph{maximal} torus T=(S^1)^k action. We give two equivalent constructions providing examples of such manifolds given a simplicial fan \Sigma and a compelx subgroup H\subset T_\mathbb C=(\mathbb C^*)^k. On every manifold M we define the canonical holomorphic foliation \mathcal F and under additional restrictions construct transverse-K\"{a}hler form \omega_\mathcal F. As an application of these constructions, we prove some results on geometry of manifolds~M regarding its analytic subsets.
