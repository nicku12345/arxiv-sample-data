In this paper we study the regularity of the Szeg\"o projection on Lebesgue and Sobolev spaces on the boundary of the unbounded model worm domain D'_\beta.   We consider the Hardy space H^2(D'_\beta). Denoting by bD'_\beta the boundary of D'_\beta, it is classical that H^2(D'_\beta) can be identified with the closed subspace of L^2(bD'_\beta,d\sigma), denoted by H^2(bD'_\beta), consisting of the boundary values of functions in H^2(D'_\beta), where d\sigma is the induced Lebesgue measure. The orthogonal Hilbert space projection P: L^2(D'_\beta,d\sigma)\to H^2(bD'_\beta) is called the Szeg\"o projection.   Let W^{s,p}(bD'_\beta) denote the Lebesgue--Sobolev space on bD'_\beta. We prove that P, initially defined on the dense subspace W^{s,p}(bD'_\beta)\cap L^2(bD'_\beta,d\sigma), extends to a bounded operator P: W^{s,p}(bD'_\beta)\to   W^{s,p}(bD'_\beta), for 1<p<\infty and s\ge0.
