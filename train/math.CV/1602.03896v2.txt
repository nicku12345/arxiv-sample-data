For certain annuli in \mathbb{C}^n, n\geq 2, with non-smooth holes, we show that the \bar{\partial}-operator from L^2 functions to L^2 (0,1)-forms has closed range. The holes admitted include products of pseudoconvex domains and certain intersections of smoothly bounded pseudoconvex domains. As a consequence, we obtain estimates in the Sobolev space W^1 for the \bar{\partial}-equation on the non-smooth domains which are the holes of these annuli.
