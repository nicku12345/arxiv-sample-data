Let \mathbb D be the unit disc and z_0\in\mathbb D. We determine the value range \{f(z_0)\,|\, f\in \mathcal{R}^\geq\}, where \mathcal{R}^\geq is the set of holomorphic functions f:\mathbb D\to\mathbb D with f(0)=0 and f'(0)\geq0 that have only real coefficients in their power series expansion around 0, and the smaller set \{f(z_0)\,|\, f\in \mathcal{R}^\geq, \text{f is typically real}\}. Furthermore, we describe a third value range \{ f(z_0) \,|\, f \in \mathcal{I}\}, where \mathcal{I} consists of all univalent self-mappings of the upper half-plane \mathbb{H} with hydrodynamical normalization which are symmetric with respect to the imaginary axis.
