A correction is brought to the opinion expressed in a previous note published in this journal that the off critical line points indicated by some authors as being non trivial zeros of the Davenport and Heilbronn function are affected of approximation errors and illustrations are presented which enforce the conclusion that they are true zeros. It is shown also that linear combinations of L-functions satisfying the same Riemann-type of functional equation do not offer counterexamples to RH, contrary to a largely accepted position.
