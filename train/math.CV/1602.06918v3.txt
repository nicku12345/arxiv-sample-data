A behavior of homeomorphisms of Orlicz--Sobolev classes in a closure of a domain is investigated. There are obtained theorems about equicontinuity of classes mentioned above in terms of prime ends of regular domains. In particular, it is proved that above classes are equicontinuous in domains with some restrictions on it's boundaries provided that the corresponding inner dilatation of order p has a majorant of finite mean oscillation at every point.
