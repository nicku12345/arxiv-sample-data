We extend the difference analogue of Cartan's second main theorem for the case of slowly moving periodic hyperplanes, and introduce two different natural ways to find a difference analogue of the truncated second main theorem. As applications, we obtain a new Picard type theorem and difference analogues of the deficiency relation for holomorphic curves.
