By investigating which level of universality composition operators C_f can have, where the symbol f is given by the restriction of a transcendental entire function to suitable parts of the Fatou set of f, this work combines the theory of dynamics of continuous linear operators on spaces of holomorphic functions with the theory of non-linear complex dynamics on the complex plane.
