In this work, we introduce two new subclasses S_{{\Sigma}_{m}}({\alpha},{\lambda}) and S_{{\Sigma}_{m}}(\b{eta},{\lambda}) of {\Sigma}_{m} consisting of analytic and m-fold symmetric bi-univalent functions in the open unit disk U. Furthermore, for functions in each of the subclasses introduced in this paper, we obtain the coefficient bounds for |a_{m+1}| and |a_{2m+1}|.
