We investigate tameness in the Fr\'echet spaces O(M) of analytic functions on Stein manifolds M equipped with the compact open topology. Actually we will look into tameness in the more general class of nuclear Fr\'echet spaces with the properties weak DN and Omega, and then specialize to analytic function spaces. We show that for a Stein manifold M, tameness of O(M) is equivalent to the hyperconvexity of M.
