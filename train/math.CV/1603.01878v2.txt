Let \varphi be a plurisubharmonic function on a pseudoconvex domain D \subset \mathbb C^n. We show that there exists a nonzero holomorphic function f on D such that some local mean value of \varphi with logarithmic additional terms majorizes \log |f|. A similar problem is discussed for a locally integrable function on D in terms of balayage of positive measures. Key words: holomorphic function, plurisubharmonicity, minorant, balayage, Jensen inequality, mean value in the ball.
