In this study, we partially answer the question left open in Rudin's book "Function theory in polydiscs" on the structure of invariant subspaces of the Hardy space H^2(U^n) on the polydisc U^n. We completely describe all invariant subspaces generated by a single function in the polydisc. Then, using our results, we give the unitary equivalence of this type of invariant subspace and a characterization of outer functions in H^2(U^n).
