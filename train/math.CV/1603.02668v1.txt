In 1968, Krzyz conjectured that for non-vanishing holomorphic functions f(z) = c_0 + c_1 z + \dots in the unit disk with |f(z)| \leq 1, we have the sharp bound |c_n| \leq 2/e for all n \geq 1, with equality only for the function f(z) = exp [(z^n - 1)/(z^n + 1)] and its rotations. This conjecture was considered by many researchers, but only partial results have been established. The desired estimate has been proved only for n \leq 5.   We provide here two different proofs of this conjecture and its generalizations based on completely different ideas.
