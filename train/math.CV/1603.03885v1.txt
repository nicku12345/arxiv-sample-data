A behavior of homeomorphisms of Orlicz classes in a closure of a domain is investigated. It is proved that above classes are equicontinuous in the closure of domains with some restrictions on it's boundaries provided that the corresponding inner dilatation of order p has a majorant of finite mean oscillation at every point.
