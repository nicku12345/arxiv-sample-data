A set V in a domain U in \mathbb{C}^n has the {\em norm-preserving extension property} if every bounded holomorphic function on V has a holomorphic extension to U with the same supremum norm. We prove that an algebraic subset of the {\em symmetrized bidisc} \[ G := \{(z+w,zw):|z|<1, |w| < 1 \} \] has the norm-preserving extension property if and only if it is either a singleton, G itself, a complex geodesic of G, or the union of the set \{(2z,z^2): |z|<1\} and a complex geodesic of degree 1 in G. We also prove that the complex geodesics in G coincide with the nontrivial holomorphic retracts in G. Thus, in contrast to the case of the ball or the bidisc, there are sets in G which have the norm-preserving extension property but are not holomorphic retracts of G. In the course of the proof we obtain a detailed classification of the complex geodesics in G modulo automorphisms of G. We give applications to von Neumann-type inequalities for \Gamma-contractions (that is, commuting pairs of operators for which the closure of G is a spectral set) and for symmetric functions of commuting pairs of contractive operators. We find three other domains that contain sets with the norm-preserving extension property which are not retracts: they are the spectral ball of 2\times 2 matrices, the tetrablock and the pentablock. We also identify the subsets of the bidisc which have the norm-preserving extension property for symmetric functions.
