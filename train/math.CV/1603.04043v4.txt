Given a set \mathfrak S of conformal maps of the unit disk \mathbb D into itself that is closed under composition, we address the question whether \mathfrak S can be represented as the reachable set of a Loewner - Kufarev - type ODE \mathrm{d}w_t/\mathrm{d}t=G_t\circ w_t, w_0=\mathsf{id}_{\mathbb D}, where the control functions t\mapsto G_t form a convex cone \mathcal M_{\mathfrak S}. For the set of all conformal \varphi:\mathbb D\to\mathbb D with \varphi(0)=0, \varphi'(0)>0, an affirmative answer to this question is the essence of Loewner's well-known Parametric Representation of univalent functions [Math. Ann. 89 (1923), 103-121]. In this paper, we study classes of conformal self-maps defined by their boundary regular fixed points and, in part of the cases, establish their Loewner-type representability.
