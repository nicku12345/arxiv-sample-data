For a probability measure with compact and non-polar support in the complex plane we relate dynamical properties of the associated sequence of orthogonal polynomials \{P_n\} to properties of the support. More precisely we relate the Julia set of P_n to the outer boundary of the support, the filled Julia set to the polynomial convex hull K of the support, and the Green's function associated with P_n to the Green's function for the complement of K.
