The Bargmann-Fock space of slice hyperholomorphic functions is recently introduced by Alpay, Colombo, Sabadini and Salomon. In this paper, we reconsider this space and present a direct proof of its independence of the slice. We also introduce a quaternionic analogue of the classical Segal-Bargmann transform and discuss some of its basic properties. The explicit expression of its inverse is obtained and the connection to the left one-dimensional quaternionic Fourier transform is given.
