We consider a pair of special functions, u_\beta and v_\beta, defined respectively as the solutions to the integral equations \begin{equation*} u(x)=1+\int^\infty_0 \frac {K(t) u(t) dt}{t+x} ~~\mbox{and}~~v(x)=1-\int^\infty_0 \frac{ K(t) v(t) dt}{t+x},~~x\in [0, \infty), \end{equation*} where K(t)= \frac {1} \pi \exp \left (- t^\beta \sin\frac {\pi\beta} 2\right )\sin \left ( t^\beta\cos\frac{\pi\beta} 2 \right ) for \beta\in (0, 1). In this note, we establish the existence and uniqueness of u_\beta and v_\beta which are bounded and continuous in [0, +\infty). Also, we show that a solution to a model Riemann-Hilbert problem in Kriecherbauer and McLaughlin [Int. Math. Res. Not., 1999] can be constructed explicitly in terms of these functions. A preliminary asymptotic study is carried out on the Stokes phenomena of these functions by making use of their connection formulas.   Several open questions are also proposed for a thorough investigation of the analytic and asymptotic properties of the functions u_\beta and v_\beta, and a related new special function G_\beta.
