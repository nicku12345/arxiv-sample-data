Let {\mathcal S} denote the class of all functions f(z)=z+\sum_{n=2}^{\infty}a_{n}z^{n} analytic and univalent in the unit disk \ID. For f\in {\mathcal S}, Zalcman conjectured that |a_n^2-a_{2n-1}|\leq (n-1)^2 for n\geq 3. This conjecture has been verified only certain values of n for f\in {\mathcal S} and for all n\ge 4 for the class \mathcal C of close-to-convex functions (and also for a couple of other classes). In this paper we provide bounds of the generalized Zalcman coefficient functional |\lambda a_n^2-a_{2n-1}| for functions in \mathcal C and for all n\ge 3, where \lambda is a positive constant. In particular, our special case settles the open problem on the Zalcman inequality for f\in \mathcal C (i.e. for the case \lambda =1 and n=3).
