Let \mathcal S denote the class of all functions of the form f(z)=z+a_2z^2+a_3z^3+\cdots which are analytic and univalent in the open unit disk \ID and, for \lambda >0, let \Phi_\lambda (n,f)=\lambda a_n^2-a_{2n-1} denote the generalized Zalcman coefficient functional. Zalcman conjectured that if f\in \mathcal S, then |\Phi_1 (n,f)|\leq (n-1)^2 for n\ge 3. The functional of the form \Phi_\lambda (n,f) is indeed related to Fekete-Szeg\H{o} functional of the n-th root transform of the corresponding function in \mathcal S. This conjecture has been verified for a certain special geometric subclasses of \mathcal S but the conjecture remains open for f\in {\mathcal S} and for n > 6. In the present paper, we prove sharp bounds on |\Phi_\lambda (n,f)| for f\in \mathcal{F}(\alpha ) and for all n\geq 3, in the case that \lambda is a positive real parameter, where  \mathcal{F}(\alpha ) denotes the family of all functions f\in {\mathcal S} satisfying the condition {\rm Re } \left( 1+\frac{zf''(z)}{f'(z)}\right) > \alpha ~\mbox{ for z\in \ID},  where -1/2\leq \alpha <1. Thus, the present article proves the generalized Zalcman conjecture for convex functions of order \alpha, \alpha \in [-1/2,1).
