We study the class \mathcal{M} of functions meromorphic outside a countable closed set of essential singularities. We show that if a function in \mathcal{M}, with at least one essential singularity, permutes with a non-constant rational map g, then g is a M\"{o}bius map that is not conjugate to an irrational rotation. For a given function  f \in\mathcal{M} which is not a M\"{o}bius map, we show that the set of functions in \mathcal{M} that permute with  f  is countably infinite. Finally, we show that there exist transcendental meromorphic functions f: \mathbb{C} \to \mathbb{C} such that, among functions meromorphic in the plane, f permutes only with itself and with the identity map.
