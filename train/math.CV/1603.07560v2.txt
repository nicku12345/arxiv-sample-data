We introduce and study the Hilbert space of (L^2,\Gamma,\chi)-likewise theta functions on \mathbb{R}^d with respect to a given discrete subgroup \Gamma of arbitrary rank and a character \chi of \Gamma. A concrete description is given and an orthonormal basis is then constructed. Its range by the classical Segal-Bargmann transform is also characterized and leads to the so-called theta-Bargmann Fock space.
