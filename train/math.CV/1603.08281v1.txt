We study the off-diagonal decay of Bergman kernels \Pi_{h^k}(z,w) and Berezin kernels P_{h^k}(z,w) for ample invariant line bundles over compact toric projective \kahler manifolds of dimension m. When the metric is real analytic, P_{h^k}(z,w) \simeq k^m \exp - k D(z,w) where D(z,w) is the diastasis. When the metric is only C^{\infty} this asymptotic cannot hold for all (z,w) since the diastasis is not even defined for all (z,w) close to the diagonal. We prove that for general C^{\infty} metrics, P_{h^k}(z,w) \simeq k^m \exp - k D(z,w) as long as w lies on the {\mathbb R}_+^m-orbit of z, and for general (z,w), \limsup_{k \to \infty} \frac{1}{k} \log P_{h^k}(z,w)   \leq - D(z^*,w^*) where D(z, w^*) is the diastasis between z and the translate of w by (S^1)^m to the {\mathbb R}_+^m orbit of z, complementary to Mike Christ's negative results (arXiv:1308.5644).
