Let M \subset {\mathbb{C}}^{n+1}, n \geq 2, be a real codimension two CR singular real-analytic submanifold that is nondegenerate and holomorphically flat. We prove that every real-analytic function on M that is CR outside the CR singularities extends to a holomorphic function in a neighborhood of M. Our motivation is to prove the following analogue of the Hartogs-Bochner theorem. Let \Omega \subset {\mathbb{C}}^n \times {\mathbb{R}}, n \geq 2, be a bounded domain with a connected real-analytic boundary such that \partial \Omega has only nondegenerate CR singularities. We prove that if f \colon \partial \Omega \to {\mathbb{C}} is a real-analytic function that is CR at CR points of \partial \Omega, then f extends to a holomorphic function on a neighborhood of \overline{\Omega} in {\mathbb{C}}^n \times {\mathbb{C}}.
