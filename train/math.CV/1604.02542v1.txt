In this paper, the effect of absolute values on the behavior of functions f in the spaces \mathcal{Q}_K is investigated. It is clear that f\in \mathcal{Q}_K(\partial {\mathbb{D}}) \Rightarrow |f|\in \mathcal{Q}_K(\partial {\mathbb{D}}), but the converse is not always true. For f in the Hardy space H^2, we give a condition involving the modulus of the function only, such that this condition together with |f|\in \mathcal{Q}_K(\partial {\mathbb{D}}) is equivalent to f\in \mathcal{Q}_K. As an application, a new criterion for inner-outer factorisation of \mathcal{Q}_K spaces is given. These results are also new for \mathcal{Q}_p spaces.
