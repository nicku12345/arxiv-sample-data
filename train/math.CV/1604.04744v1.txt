This work is a complement of the study on H\"ormander's solution of the \bar\partial equation initialised by H. Hedenmalm. Let \varphi be a strictly plurisubharmonic function of class C 2 in C n, let c_\varphi(z) be the smallest eigenvalue of i\partial\bar\partial\varphi then \forall z\in\mathbb{C}^n, c_\varphi (z)>0. We denote by L^2_{p,q}(\mathbb{C}^n, e^\varphi) the (p, q) currents with coefficients in L^2_{p,q}(\mathbb{C}^n, e^\varphi). We prove that if \omega\in L^2_{p,q}(\mathbb{C}^n,e^\varphi), \bar\partial\omega = 0 for q <n then there is a solution u \in L ^2_{p,q-1}(\mathbb{C}^n,c_\varphi e^\varphi) of \bar\partialu = \omega. This is done via a theorem giving a solution with compact support if the data has compact support.
