In the present paper, we study spirallikenss (including starlikeness) of the shifted hypergeometric function f(z)=z_2F_1(a,b;c;z) with complex parameters a,b,c, where _2F_1(a,b;c;z) stands for the Gaussian hypergeometric function. First, we observe the asymptotic behaviour of _2F_1(a,b;c;z) around the point z=1 to obtain necessary conditions for f to be \lambda-spirallike for a given \lambda with - \pi/2< \lambda<\pi/2. We next give sufficient conditions for f to be \lambda-spirallike. As special cases, we obtain sufficient conditions of strong starlikeness and examples of spirallike, but not starlike, shifted hypergeometric functions.
