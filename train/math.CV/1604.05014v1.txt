In our previous work, for a given Riemann surface Y_0 with marked handle, we investigated geometric properties of the set of marked once-holed tori X allowing holomorphic mappings of X into Y_0. It turned out that it is a closed domain with Lipschitz boundary. In the present paper we show that the boundary is never smooth. Also, we evaluate the critical extremal length for the existence of holomorphic mappings in terms of hyperbolic lengths.
