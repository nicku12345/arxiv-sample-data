We extend classical results by Lavrent'ev and Kufarev concerning the product of the conformal radii of planar non-overlapping domains. We also extend relatively recent results for the case of domains in the n-dimensional Euclidean space, n \geq 3, with conformal radii replaced by harmonic ones. Namely, we get analogues of these results in n-dimensional Euclidean space in terms of p-harmonic radius. The proofs are based on technique of modulii of curve families and dissymmetrization of such families.
