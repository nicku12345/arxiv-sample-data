We consider the class of all analytic and locally univalent functions f of the form f(z)=z+\sum_{n=2}^\infty a_{2n-1} z^{2n-1}, |z|<1, satisfying the condition  {\rm Re}\,\left(1+\frac{zf^{\prime\prime}(z)}{f^\prime (z)}\right)>-\frac{1}{2}.  We show that every section s_{2n-1}(z)=z+\sum_{k=2}^na_{2k-1}z^{2k-1}, of f, is convex in the disk |z|<\sqrt{2}/3. We also prove that the radius \sqrt{2}/3 is best possible, i.e. the number \sqrt{2}/3 cannot be replaced by a larger one.
