The characterization of the solvability of matrix versions of truncated Stieltjes-type moment problems led to the class of \alpha-Stieltjes non-negative definite sequences of complex q \times q matrices. In [21], a parametrization of this class was introduced, the so-called \alpha-Stieltjes parametrization. The main topic of this first part of the paper is the construction of a Schur-type algorithm which produces exactly the \alpha-Stieltjes parametrization.
