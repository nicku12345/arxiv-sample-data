Let {\mathcal A} denote the family of all functions f analytic in the unit disk \ID and satisfying the normalization f(0)=0= f'(0)-1. Let \mathcal{S} denote the subclass of {\mathcal A} consisting of univalent functions in \ID. We consider the subclass \mathcal{U}  of \mathcal{S} that is defined by the condition that for its members f the condition \left |\left (\frac{z}{f(z)} \right )^{2}f'(z)-1\right | < 1 ~\mbox{ for z\in \ID}  holds. To theses relations belong striking similarities and on the other hand big differences. We show that some results about \mathcal{S} can be improved for \mathcal{U}, while others cannot.
