Let X be an Abelian cover \mathbb{CP}^{1} ramified at mr points, \lambda_1...\lambda_{mr}. we define a class of non positive divisors on X of degree g-1 supported in the pre images of the branch points on X, such that the Riemann theta function doesn't vanish on their image in J(X). We obtain a Thomae formula similar to the formulas [BR],[Na],[Z] ,[EG] and [Ko]. We show that up to a certain determinant of the non standard periods of X, the value of the Riemann theta function at these divisors raised to a high enough power is a polynomial in the branch point of the curve X. Our approach is based on a refinement of Accola's results and Nakayashiki's approach explained in [Na] for Abelian covers.
