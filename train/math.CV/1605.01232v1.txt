In this paper, we prove Huang et al.'s conjecture stated that if f is a holomorphic function on \Delta^+:=\{z\in \mathbb C \colon |z|<1,~\mathrm{Im}(z)>0\} with \mathcal{C}^\infty-smooth extension up to (-1,1) such that f maps (-1,1) into a cone \Gamma_C:=\{z\in \mathbb C\colon |\mathrm{Im} (z)| \leq C|\mathrm{Re} (z)|\}, for some positive number C, and f vanishes to infinite order at 0, then f vanishes identically. In addition, some regularity properties of the Riemann mapping functions on the boundary and an example concerning Huang et al.'s conjecture are also given.
