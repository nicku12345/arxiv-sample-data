In this paper, we prove necessary and sufficient conditions for a sense-preserving harmonic function to be absolutely convex in the open unit disk. We also estimate the coefficient bound and obtain growth, covering and area theorems for absolutely convex harmonic mappings. A natural generalization of the classical Bernardi type operator for harmonic functions is considered and its connection between certain classes of uniformly starlike harmonic functions and uniformly convex harmonic functions is also investigated. At the end, as applications, we present a number of results connected with hypergeometric and polylogarithm functions.
