In this paper, a class of \log-polyharmonic mappings \mathcal{L}_p\mathcal{H} together with its subclass \mathcal{L}_p\mathcal{H}(G) in the unit disk \mathbb{D}=\{z: |z|<1\} is introduced, and several geometrical properties such as the starlikeness, convexity and univalence are investigated. In particular, we consider the Goodman-Saff conjecture and prove that the conjecture is true in \mathcal{L}_p\mathcal{H}(G).
