In this paper we obtain sharp weighted estimates for solutions of the \partial-equation in a lineally convex domains of finite type. Precisely we obtain estimates in spaces of the form L p ({\Omega},\delta \gamma), \delta being the distance to the boundary, with gain on the index p and the exponent \gamma. These estimates allow us to extend the L p ({\Omega},\delta \gamma) and lipschitz regularity results for weighted Bergman projection obtained in [CDM14b] for convex domains to more general weights.
