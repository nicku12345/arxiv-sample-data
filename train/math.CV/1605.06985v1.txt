The purpose of this paper is to characterize the zero sets of holomorphic functions in the Nevanlinna class on a class of convex domains of infinite type in \mathbb{C}^2. Moreover, we also obtain L^p estimates, 1 \leq p \leq \infty, for a particular solution of the tangential Cauchy-Riemann equation on the boundaries of these domains.
