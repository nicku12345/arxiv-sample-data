A new approach in Loewner Theory proposed by Bracci, Contreras, D\'iaz-Madrigal and Gumenyuk provides a unified treatment of the radial and the chordal versions of the Loewner equations. In this framework, a generalized Loewner chain satisfies the differential equation  \partial_{t}f_{t}(z) = (z - \tau(t))(1-\overline{\tau(t)}z)\partial_{z}f_{t}(z)p(z,t),  where \tau : [0,\infty) \to \overline{\mathbb{D}} is measurable and p is called a Herglotz function. In this paper, we will show that if there exists a k \in [0,1) such that p satisfies  |p(z,t) - 1| \leq k |p(z,t) + 1|  for all z \in \mathbb{D} and almost all t \in [0,\infty), then f_{t} has a k-quasiconformal extension to the whole Riemann sphere for all t \in [0,\infty). The radial case (\tau =0) and the chordal case (\tau=1) have been proven by Becker [J. Reine Angew. Math. \textbf{255} (1972), 23-43] and Gumenyuk and the author (Math. Z. \textbf{285} (2017), no.3, 1063--1089). In our theorem, no superfluous assumption is imposed on \tau \in \overline{\mathbb{D}}. As a key foundation of our proof is an approximation method using the continuous dependence of evolution families.
