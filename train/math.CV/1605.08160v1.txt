In this paper we investigate finitely generated ideals in the Nevanlinna class. We prove analogues to some known results for the algebra of bounded analytic functions H^{\infty}. We also show that, in contrast to the H^{\infty}-case, the stable rank of the Nevanlinna class is strictly bigger than 1.
