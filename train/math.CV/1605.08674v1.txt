We study the problem of geometric zero packing, recently introduced by Hedenmalm. There are two natural densities associated to this problem: the discrepancy density \rho_{\mathbb{H}}, given by  \rho_{\mathbb{H}} = \liminf_{r\to 1^-} \inf_{f} \frac{\int_{\mathbb{D}(0,r)} \left((1-\lvert z\rvert^2) \lvert f(z)\rvert-1\right)^2 \frac{dA(z)}{1-\lvert z\rvert^2}} {\int_{\mathbb{D}(0,r)} \frac{dA(z)}{1-\lvert z\rvert^2}}  which measures the discrepancy in optimal approximation of (1-\lvert z\rvert^2)^{-1} with the modulus of polynomials f, and it's relative, the tight discrepancy density \rho_{\mathbb{H}}^*, which will trivially satisfy \rho_{\mathbb{H}}\leq\rho_{\mathbb{H}}^*. These densities have deep connections to the boundary behaviour of conformal mappings with k-quasiconformal extensions, which can be seen from the Hedenmalm's result that the universal asymptotic variance \Sigma^2 is related to \rho_{\mathbb{H}}^* by \Sigma^2=1-\rho_{\mathbb{H}}^*. Here we prove that in fact \rho_{\mathbb{H}}=\rho_{\mathbb{H}}^*, resolving a conjecture by Hedenmalm in the positive. The natural planar analogues \rho_{\mathbb{C}} and \rho_{\mathbb{C}}^* to these densities make contact with work of Abrikosov on Bose-Einstein condensates. As a second result we prove that also \rho_{\mathbb{C}}=\rho_{\mathbb{C}}^*. The methods are based on Ameur, Hedenmalm and Makarov's H\"ormander-type \bar\partial-estimates with polynomial growth control. As a consequence we obtain sufficiency results on the degrees of approximately optimal polynomials.
