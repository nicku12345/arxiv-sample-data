In the paper [1] we consider a new class, so-called, G-monogenic (differentiable in the sense of Gateaux) quaternionic mappings. In the present paper we introduce quaternionic H-monogenic (differentiable in the sense of Hausdorff) mappings and establish the relation between G-monogenic and H-monogenic mappings. The equivalence of different definitions of G-monogenic mapping is proved.
