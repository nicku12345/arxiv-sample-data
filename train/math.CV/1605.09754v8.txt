We prove that the upper envelope of a family of subharmonic functions defined on an open subset of \mathbb{R}^{N}, (N\geq2), that is finite every where, is locally bounded above outside a closed nowhere dense set with no bounded components. Then we conclude as a consequence that a separately subharmonic function is subharmonic outside a closed nowhere dense set with no bounded components. It generalizes a result due to Cegrell and Sadullaev.
