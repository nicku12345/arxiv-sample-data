Let K\subset \mathbb{C} be a polynomially convex compact set, f be a function analytic in a domain \overline{\mathbb{C}}\smallsetminus K with Taylor expansion f\left( z\right) =\sum_{k=0}^{\infty }\frac{a_{k}}{z^{k+1}}  at \infty , and H_{s}\left( f\right) :=\det \left( a_{k+l}\right) _{k,l=0}^{s} related Hankel determinants. The classical Polya theorem \cite% {P} says that \[ \limsup_{s\rightarrow \infty }\left\vert H_{s}\left( f\right) \right\vert ^{1/s^{2}}\leq d\left( K\right) , \]% where d\left( K\right)  is the transfinite diameter of K. The main result of this paper is multivariate internal analogs of Polya's inequality for \mathbb{C}-convex (=strictly linearly convex) domains D\subset \mathbb{C}^{n} and weighted Hankel-type determinants, constructed from the Taylor coefficients of a function f\in A\left( D\right)  at a given point % a\in D; therewith the weights are generated by s-indicatrices of the sequence of analytic functionals biorthogonal to the system of monomials in % \mathbb{C}^{n}. It is proved by the reduction to the outer multivariate analog of Polya's inequality (Zakharyuta, Math. USSR Sbornik, \textbf{25 }% (1975)) and is based on the characterization of the strict linear convexity in terms of s-indicatrices (S. Znamenskii, Siberian Math. J. \textbf{26 } (1985)).
