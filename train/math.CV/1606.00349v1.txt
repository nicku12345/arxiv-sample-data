We find an extremal problem for conformal maps on a finitely connected subregion of the Riemann sphere containing the point at infinity whose unique solution is a map onto a square domain, that is, a domain whose complementary components are (possibly degenerate) squares with sides parallel to the real or the imaginary axis.
