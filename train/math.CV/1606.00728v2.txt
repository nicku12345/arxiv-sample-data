These notes are concerned with the L^{2}-Sobolev theory of the complex Green operator on pseudoconvex, oriented, bounded and closed CR--submanifolds of \mathbb{C}^{n} of hypersurface type. This class of submanifolds generalizes that of boundaries of pseudoconvex domains. We first discuss briefly the CR--geometry of general CR--submanifolds and then specialize to this class. Next, we review the basic L^{2}-theory of the tangential Cauchy-Riemann operator and the associated complex Green operator(s) on these submanifolds. After these preparations, we discuss recent results on compactness and regularity in Sobolev spaces of the complex Green operator(s).
