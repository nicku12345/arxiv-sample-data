I construct a quasianalytic field \mathcal F of germs at +\infty of real functions with logarithmic generalized power series as asymp\-totic expansions, such that \mathcal F is closed under differentiation and \log-composition; in particular, \mathcal F is a Hardy field. Moreover, the field \mathcal F \circ (-\log) of germs at 0^+ contains all transition maps of hyperbolic saddles of planar real analytic vector fields.
