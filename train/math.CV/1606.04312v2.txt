We consider the problem of interpolating a holomorphic family of nondegenerate holomorphic jets on C^n for n > 1, parametrized by points in a Stein manifold, by a holomorphic family of automorphisms of C^n. We show that under a suitable topological condition it is possible to find a solution, thereby generalizing results of Forstneric and Varolin concerning the nonparametric jet interpolation by automorphisms.
