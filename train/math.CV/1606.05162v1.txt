The logarithmic coefficients \gamma_n of an analytic and univalent function f in the unit disk \mathbb{D}=\{z\in\mathbb{C}:|z|<1\} with the normalization f(0)=0=f'(0)-1 is defined by \log \frac{f(z)}{z}= 2\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \gamma_n z^n. Recently, D.K. Thomas [On the logarithmic coefficients of close to convex functions, {\it Proc. Amer. Math. Soc.} {\bf 144} (2016), 1681--1687] proved that |\gamma_3|\le \frac{7}{12} for functions in a subclass of close-to-convex functions (with argument 0) and claimed that the estimate is sharp by providing a form of a extremal function. In the present paper, we pointed out that such extremal functions do not exist and the estimate is not sharp by providing a much more improved bound for the whole class of close-to-convex functions (with argument 0). We also determine a sharp upper bound of |\gamma_3| for close-to-convex functions (with argument 0) with respect to the Koebe function.
