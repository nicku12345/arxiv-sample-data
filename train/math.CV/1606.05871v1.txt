In this paper, we consider bounded strictly pseudoconvex domains D\subset \mathbb C^2 with smooth boundary M=M^3:=\partial D. If we consider the asymptotic expansion of the Bergman kernel on the diagonal  K_B\sim \frac{\phi_B}{\rho^{n+1}}+\psi_B\log\rho,  where \rho>0 is a Fefferman defining equation for D, then it is well known that the trace of the log term b\psi_B:=(\psi_B)|_M on M does not determine the CR geometry of M locally; e.g., the vanishing of b\psi_B on an open subset of M does not imply that M is locally spherical there. Nevertheless, the main result in this paper is that if D\subset \mathbb C^2 is assumed to have transverse symmetry, then the global vanishing of b\psi_B on M implies that M is locally spherical. A similar result is proved for the Szeg\H o kernel.
