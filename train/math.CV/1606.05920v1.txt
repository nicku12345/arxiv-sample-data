It is shown that there exists a compact set X in {\bf C}^N (N\geq 2) such that \widehat X\setminus X is nonempty and the uniform algebra P(X) has a dense set of invertible elements, a large Gleason part, and an abundance of nonzero bounded point derivations. The existence of a Swiss cheese X such that R(X) has a Gleason part of full planar measure and a nonzero bounded point derivation at almost every point is established. An analogous result in {\bf C}^N is presented. The analogue for rational hulls of a result of Duval and Levenberg on polynomial hulls containing no analytic discs is established. The results presented address questions raised by Dales and Feinstein.
