Let m,n\geq 1 are integers and D be a domain in the  \mathbb C^n or in the m-dimensional real space \mathbb R^m. We build positive subharmonic functions on D vanishing on the boundary \partial D of D.   We use such (test) functions to study the distribution of zero sets of holomorphic functions f on D\subset \mathbb C^n with restrictions on the growth of f near the boundary \partial D.
