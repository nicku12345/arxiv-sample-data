This paper investigates the location of the zeros of a sequence of polynomials generated by a rational function with a denominator of the form G(z,t)=P(t)+zt^{r}, where the zeros of P are positive and real. We show that every member of a family of such generating functions - parametrized by the degree of P and r - gives rise to a sequence of polynomials \{H_{m}(z)\}_{m=0}^{\infty} that is eventually hyperbolic. Moreover, when P(0)>0 the real zeros of the polynomials H_{m}(z) form a dense subset of an interval I\subset\mathbb{R}^{+}, whose length depends on the particular values of the parameters in the generating function.
