Let \mathcal{H} denote the class of harmonic functions f in \mathbb{D}:= \{z\in \mathbb{C}:|z| < 1\} normalized by f(0) = 0 = f_z(0) -1. For \alpha \geq 0, we consider the following class \mathcal{W}^0_{\mathcal{H}}(\alpha):= \{f = h + \overline{g}\in\mathcal{H}: {\rm Re\,}(h'(z) + \alpha z h''(z)) >|g'(z) + \alpha z g''(z)|, \quad z\in \mathbb{D}\}.  In this paper, we first prove the coefficient conjecture of Clunie and Sheil-Small for functions in the class \mathcal{W}^0_{\mathcal{H}}(\alpha). We also prove growth theorem, convolution, convex combination properties for functions in the class \mathcal{W}^0_{\mathcal{H}}(\alpha). Finally, we determine the value of r so that the partial sums of functions in the class \mathcal{W}^0_{\mathcal{H}}(\alpha) are close-to-convex in |z|<r.
