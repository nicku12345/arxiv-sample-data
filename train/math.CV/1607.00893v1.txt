We study minimum sets of singular plurisubharmonic functions and their relation to upper contact sets. In particular we develop an algorithm checking when a naturally parametrized curve is such a minimum set. The case of Koch curves is studied in detail. We also study the size of the set of upper non-contact points. We show that this set is always of Lebesgue measure zero thus answering an open problem in the viscosity approach to the complex Monge-Amp\`ere equation. Finally, we prove that similarly to the case of convex functions, strictly plurisubharmonic lower tests yield existence of upper tests with a control on the opening.
