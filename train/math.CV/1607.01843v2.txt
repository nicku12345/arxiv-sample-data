Let \mathcal{S} denote the class of functions analytic and univalent (i.e. one-to-one) in the unit disk \mathbb{D}=\{z\in\mathbb{C}:\, |z|<1\} normalized by f(0)=0=f'(0)-1. The logarithmic coefficients \gamma_n of f\in\mathcal{S} are defined by \log \frac{f(z)}{z}= 2\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \gamma_n z^n. In the present paper, we determine the sharp upper bounds for |\gamma_1|, |\gamma_2| and |\gamma_3| when f belongs to some familiar subclasses of close-to-convex functions.
