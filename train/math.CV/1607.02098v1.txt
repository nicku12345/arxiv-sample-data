In this paper we give some sufficient conditions of analyticity and univalence for functions defined by an integral operator. Next, we refine the result to a quasiconformal extension criterion with the help of the Becker's method. Further, new univalence criteria and the significant relationships with other results are given. A number of known univalence conditions would follow upon specializing the parameters involved in our main results.
