We are interested in finding the sufficient conditions on A, B, \lambda, b and c which ensure that the generalized Bessel functions {u}_{\lambda}:={u}_{\lambda,b,c} satisfies the subordination {u}_{\lambda}(z) \prec (1+Az)/ (1+Bz). Also, conditions for which {u}_{\lambda}(z) to be Janowski convex, and z{u}'_{\lambda}(z) to be Janowski starlike in the unit disk \mathbb{D}=\{z \in \mathbb{C}: |z|<1\} are obtained.
