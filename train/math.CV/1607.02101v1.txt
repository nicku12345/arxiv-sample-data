The error function occurs widely in multiple areas of mathematics, mathematical physics and natural sciences. There has been no work in this area for the past four decades. In this article, we estimate the coefficient bounds with q-difference operator for certain classes of the spirallike starlike and convex error function associated with convolution product using subordination as well as quasi-subordination. Though this concept is an untrodden path in the field of complex function theory, it will prove to be an encouraging future study for researchers on error function.
