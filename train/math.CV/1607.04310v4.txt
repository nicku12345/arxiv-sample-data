Suppose G is a connected complex Lie group and H is a closed complex subgroup. Then there exists a closed complex subgroup J of G containing H such that the fibration \pi:G/H \to G/J is the holomorphic reduction of G/H, i.e., G/J is holomorphically separable and {\mathcal O}(G/H) \cong \pi^*{\mathcal O}(G/J). In this paper we prove that if G/H is pseudoconvex, i.e., if G/H admits a continuous plurisubharmonic exhaustion function, then G/J is Stein and J/H has no non--constant holomorphic functions.
