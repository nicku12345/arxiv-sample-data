Let f be a meromorphic function with simply connected domain G\subset\mathbb{C}, and let \Gamma\subset\mathbb{C} be a smooth Jordan curve. We call a component of f^{-1}(\Gamma) in G a \Gamma-pseudo-lemniscate of f. In this note we give criteria for a smooth Jordan curve \mathcal{S} in G (with bounded face D) to be a psuedo-lemniscate of f in terms of the number of preimages (counted with multiplicity) which a given w has under f in D, as w ranges over the Riemann sphere. We also develop a test, in the same terms, by which one may show that the image of a Jordan curve under f is not a Jordan curve.
