Based on the quasiconformal theory of the universal Teichm\"uller space, we introduce the Teichm\"uller space of diffeomorphisms of the unit circle with \alpha-H\"older continuous derivatives as a subspace of the universal Teichm\"uller space. We characterize such a diffeomorphism quantitatively in terms of the complex dilatation of its quasiconformal extension and the Schwarzian derivative given by the Bers embedding. Then, we provide a complex Banach manifold structure for it and prove that its topology coincides with the one induced by local C^{1+\alpha}-topology at the base point.
