In our article of 2002 joint with N. Kruzhilin we showed that every connected complex manifold of dimension n\ge 2 that admits an effective transitive action by holomorphic transformations of the unitary group {\rm U}_n is biholomorphic to the quotient of a Hopf manifold by the action of {\mathbb Z}_m for some integer m satisfying (n,m)=1. In this note, we complement the above result with an explicit description of all effective transitive actions of {\rm U}_n on such quotients, which provides an answer to a 10-year old question.
