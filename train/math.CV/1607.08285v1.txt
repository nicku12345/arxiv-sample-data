In this paper we introduce and investigate two new subclasses of the function class \Sigma of bi-univalent functions of complex order defined in the open unit disk, which are associated with the Hohlov operator, and satisfying subordinate conditions. Furthermore, we find estimates on the Taylor-MacLaurin coefficients |a_2| and |a_3| for functions in these new subclasses. Several known or new consequences of these results are also pointed out.
