We describe differentiation-invariant subspaces of C^\infty(a,b) which admit spectral synthesis. This gives a complete answer to a question posed by A.~Aleman and B.~Korenblum. It turns out that this problem is related to a classical problem of approximation by polynomials on the real line. We will depict an intriguing connection between these problems and the theory of de Branges spaces.
