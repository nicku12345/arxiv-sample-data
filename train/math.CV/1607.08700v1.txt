The logarithmic coefficients \gamma_n of an analytic and univalent function f in the unit disk \mathbb{D}=\{z\in\mathbb{C}:|z|<1\} with the normalization f(0)=0=f'(0)-1 are defined by \log \frac{f(z)}{z}= 2\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \gamma_n z^n. In the present paper, we consider close-to-convex functions (with argument 0) with respect to odd starlike functions and determine the sharp upper bound of |\gamma_n|, n=1,2,3 for such functions f.
