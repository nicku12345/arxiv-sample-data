We obtain similar types of conclusions as that of Br\"{u}ck \cite{3} for two differential polynomials which in turn radically improve and generalize several existing results. Moreover a number of examples have been exhibited to justify the necessity or sharpness of some conditions used in the paper. At last we pose an open problem for future research.
