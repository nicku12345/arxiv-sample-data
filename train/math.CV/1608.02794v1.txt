Let (X,\omega) be a compact n-dimensional K\"ahler manifold on which the integral of \omega^n is 1. Let K be an immersed real \mathcal{C}^3 submanifold of X such that the tangent space at any point of K is not contained in any complex hyperplane of the (real) tangent space at that point of X. Let \mu be a probability measure compactly supported on K with L^p density for some p>1. We prove that the complex Monge-Amp\`ere equation (dd^c \varphi + \omega)^n=\mu has a H\"older continuous solution.
