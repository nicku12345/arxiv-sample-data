We study singular hermitian metrics on holomorphic vector bundles, following Berndtsson-P{\u{a}}un. Previous work by Raufi has shown that for such metrics, it is in general not possible to define the curvature as a current with measure coefficients. In this paper we show that despite this, under appropriate codimension restrictions on the singular set of the metric, it is still possible to define Chern forms as closed currents of order 0 with locally finite mass, which represent the Chern classes of the vector bundle.
