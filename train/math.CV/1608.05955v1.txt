We study composition operators on the Fock spaces \mathcal{F}^2_\alpha(\mathbb{C}^n), problems considered include the essential norm, normality, spectra, cyclicity and membership in the Schatten classes. We give perfect answers for these basic properties, which present lots of different characterizations with the composition operators on the Hardy space or the weighted Bergman spaces.
