In a recent paper, Chu and Zhou [Advances in Combinatorics, I.S. Kotsireas and E.V. Zima(eds.), 139-159 (2013)] established in all 40 closed formulae for terminating Watson-like hypergeometric _{3}F_2- series by investigating through Gould and Hsu's fundamental pair of inverse series relations, the dual relations of Dougall's formula for the very well - poised _{5}F_4 - series.   The aim of this short note is just to point out that out of 40 results, 33 results have already been discovered in 1992 by Lavoie, et al.
