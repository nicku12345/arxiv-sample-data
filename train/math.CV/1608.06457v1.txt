We characterize the uniform limits of Dirichlet polynomials on a right half plane. In the Dirichlet setting, we find approximation results, with respect to the Euclidean distance and {to} the chordal one as well, analogous to classical results of Runge, Mergelyan and Vitushkin. We also strengthen the notion of universal Dirichlet series.
