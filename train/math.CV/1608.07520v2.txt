For an analytic and univalent function f in the unit disk \mathbb{D}:=\{z\in\mathbb{C}:|z|<1\} with the normalization f(0)=0=f'(0)-1, the logarithmic coefficients \gamma_n are defined by \log \frac{f(z)}{z}= 2\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \gamma_n z^n. In the present paper, we consider the class of close-to-convex functions (with argument 0), and determine the sharp upper bound of |\gamma_3| for such functions f, which proves a recent conjecture of the first and third authors [1].
