In a neighborhood of isolated point of a domain of a metric space, a behavior of generalized quasiconformal mappings is studied. It is proved that, mappings mentioned above have continuous extension to the domain at some additional conditions. As consequence, an analog of Sokhotski--Weierstrass theorem is obtained.
