In this work, we study families of singular surfaces in \mathbb{C}^3 parametrized by \mathcal{A}-finitely determined map germs. We consider the topological triviality and Whitney equisingularity of an unfolding F of a finitely determined map germ f:(\mathbb{C}^2,0)\rightarrow(\mathbb{C}^3,0). We investigate the following conjecture: topological triviality implies Whitney equisingularity of the unfolding F? We provide a complete answer to this conjecture, given counterexamples showing how the conjecture can be false.
