We provide regularity results for CR-maps between real hypersurfaces in complex spaces of different dimension with a Levi-degenerate target. We address both the real-analytic and the smooth case. Our results allow immediate applications to the study of proper holomorphic maps between Bounded Symmetric Domains.
