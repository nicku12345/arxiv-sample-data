We prove that the existence of totally real immersions of manifolds is a closed property under cut-and-paste constructions along submanifolds including connected sums. We study the existence of totally real embeddings for simply connected 5-manifolds and orientable 6-manifolds and determine the diffeomorphism and homotopy types. We show that the fundamental group is not an obstruction for the existence of a totally real embedding for high-dimensional manifolds in contrast with the situation in dimension four.
