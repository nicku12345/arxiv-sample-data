We prove the following: For \epsilon>0, let D_\epsilon be the bounded strictly pseudoconvex domain in \mathbb C^2 given by \begin{equation*} (\log|z|)^2+(\log|w|)^2<\epsilon^2. \end{equation*} The boundary M_\epsilon:=\partial D_\epsilon\subset \mathbb C^2 is a compact strictly pseudoconvex CR manifold without umbilical points. This resolves a long-standing question in complex analysis that goes back to the work of S.-S. Chern and J. K. Moser in 1974.
