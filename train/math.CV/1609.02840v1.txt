The \Pi-operator (Ahlfors-Beurling transform) plays an important role in solving the Beltrami equation. In this paper we define two \Pi-operators on the n-sphere. The first spherical \Pi-operator is shown to be an L^2 isometry up to isomorphism. To improve this, with the help of the spectrum of the spherical Dirac operator, the second spherical \Pi operator is constructed as an isometric L^2 operator over the sphere. Some analogous properties for both \Pi-operators are also developed. We also study the applications of both spherical \Pi-operators to the solution of the spherical Beltrami equations.
