In this paper, we define what is called a quasi-Reinhardt domain and study biholomorphisms between such domains. We show that all biholomorphisms between two bounded quasi-Reinhardt domains fixing the origin are polynomial mappings, and we give a uniform upper bound for the degree of such polynomial mappings. In particular, we generalize the classical Cartan's linearity theorem for circular domains to quasi-Reinhardt domains.
