We study singular curves from analytic point of view. We give completely analytic proofs for the Serre duality and a generalized Abel's theorem. We also reconsider Picard varieties, Albanese varieties and generalized Jacobi varieties of singular curves analytically. We call an Albanese variety considered as a complex Lie group an analytic Albanese variety. We investigate them in detail. For a non-singular curve (a compact Riemann surface) X, there is the relation between the meromorphic function fields on X and on its Jacobi variety J(X). We try to extend this relation to the case of singular curves.
