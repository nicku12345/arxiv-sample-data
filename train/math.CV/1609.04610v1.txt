We extend a recent result of Avelin, Hed, and Persson about approximation of functions u that are plurisubharmonic on a domain \Omega and continuous on \bar\Omega, with functions that are plurisubharmonic on (shrinking) neighborhoods of \bar\Omega. We show that such approximation is possible if the boundary of \Omega is C^0 outside a countable exceptional set E\subset\partial \Omega. In particular, approximation is possible on the Hartogs triangle. For H\"older continuous u, approximation is possible under less restrictive conditions on E. We next give examples of domains where this kind of approximation is not possible, even when approximation in the H\"older continuous case is possible.
