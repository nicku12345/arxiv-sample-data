We present a construction of regular Stein neighborhoods of a union of maximally totally real subspaces M=(A+iI)\mathbb{R}^n and N=\mathbb{R}^n in \mathbb{C}^n, provided that the entries of a real n \times n matrix A are sufficiently small. Our proof is based on a local construction of a suitable plurisubharmonic function \rho near the origin, such that the sublevel sets of \rho are strongly pseudoconvex and admit strong deformation retraction to M\cup N. We also give the application of this result to totally real immersions of real n-manifolds in \mathbb{C}^n with only finitely many double points, and such that the union of the tangent spaces at each intersection in some local coordinates coincides with M\cup N, described above.
