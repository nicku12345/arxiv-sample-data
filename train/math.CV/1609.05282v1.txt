We consider the convolution of half-plane harmonic mappings with respective dilatations (z+a)/(1+az) and e^{i\theta}z^{n}, where -1<a<1 and \theta\in\mathbb{R},n\in\mathbb{N}. We prove that such convolutions are locally univalent for n=1, which solves an open problem of Dorff et. al (see \cite[Problem~3.26]{Bshouty2010}). Moreover, we provide some numerical computations to illustrate that such convolutions are not univalent for n\geq 2.
