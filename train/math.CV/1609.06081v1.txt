We show that the family of all holomorphic functions f in a domain D satisfying \frac{|f^{(k)}|}{1+|f|}(z)\le C \qquad \mbox{ for all } z\in D (where k is a natural number and C>0) is quasi-normal. Furthermore, we give a general counterexample to show that for \alpha>1 and k\ge2 the condition \frac{|f^{(k)}|}{1+|f|^\alpha}(z)\le C \qquad \mbox{ for all } z\in D does not imply quasi-normality.
