Let f:\mathbb{D}\to\mathbb{C} be a bounded analytic function. A set K\subset\mathbb{D} which contains the point 1 in its boundary is called a convergence set for f at 1 if f(z) converges to some value \zeta as z\to1 with z\in K. K is called a path divergence set for f at 1 if f diverges along every path \gamma which lies in K and approaches 1. In this article, we show that for a path \gamma through the unit disk from -1 to 1, if f fails to converge along \gamma, then either the region above \gamma or the region below \gamma is a path divergence set for f. On the other hand, if \gamma_1 and \gamma_2 are two such paths, and f converges along both \gamma_1 and \gamma_2, then the region between \gamma_1 and \gamma_2 is a convergence set for f. This latter fact is immediate when \gamma_1 and \gamma_2 do not intersect except at their end-points, but becomes non-trivial when \gamma_1 and \gamma_2 are highly intersecting. We conclude the paper with an examination of the convergence sets for the function e^{\frac{z+1}{z-1}} at 1.
