Let X be an elliptic curve and \mathbb{P} the Riemann sphere. Since X is compact, it is a deep theorem of Douady that the set \mathcal{O}(X,\mathbb{P}) consisting of holomorphic maps X\to \mathbb{P} admits a complex structure. If R_n denotes the set of maps of degree n, then Namba has shown for n\geq2 that R_n is a 2n-dimensional complex manifold. We study holomorphic flexibility properties of the spaces R_2 and R_3. Firstly, we show that R_2 is homogeneous and hence an Oka manifold. Secondly, we present our main theorem, that there is a 6-sheeted branched covering space of R_3 that is an Oka manifold. It follows that R_3 is \mathbb{C}-connected and dominable. We show that R_3 is Oka if and only if \mathbb{P}_2\backslash C is Oka, where C is a cubic curve that is the image of a certain embedding of X into \mathbb{P}_2. We investigate the strong dominability of R_3 and show that if X is not biholomorphic to \mathbb{C}/\Gamma_0, where \Gamma_0 is the hexagonal lattice, then R_3 is strongly dominable. As a Lie group, X acts freely on R_3 by precomposition by translations. We show that R_3 is holomorphically convex and that the quotient space R_3/X is a Stein manifold. We construct an alternative 6-sheeted Oka branched covering space of R_3 and prove that it is isomorphic to our first construction in a natural way. This alternative construction gives us an easier way of interpreting the fibres of the branched covering map.
