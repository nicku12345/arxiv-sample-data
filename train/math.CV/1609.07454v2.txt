Let \Omega=\widetilde{\Omega}\setminus \overline{D} where \widetilde{\Omega} is a bounded domain with connected complement in \mathbb C^n (or more generally in a Stein manifold) and D is relatively compact open subset of \widetilde{\Omega} with connected complement in \widetilde{\Omega}. We obtain characterizations of pseudoconvexity of \widetilde{\Omega} and D through the vanishing or Hausdorff property of the Dolbeault cohomology groups on various function spaces. In particular, we show that if the boundaries of \widetilde{\Omega} and D are Lipschitz and C^2-smooth respectively, then both \widetilde{\Omega} and D are pseudoconvex if and only if 0 is not in the spectrum of the \overline\partial-Neumann Laplacian on (0, q)-forms for 1\le q\le n-2 when n\geq 3; or 0 is not a limit point of the spectrum of the \overline\partial-Neumannn Laplacian on (0, 1)-forms when n=2.
