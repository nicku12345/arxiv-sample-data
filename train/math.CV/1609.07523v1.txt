We study the complexity of holomorphic isometries and proper maps from the complex unit ball to type IV classical domains. We investigate on degree estimates of holomorphic isometries and holomorphic maps with minimum target dimension. We also construct a real-parameter family of mutually inequivalent holomorphic isometries from the unit ball to type IV domains. We also provide examples of non-isometric proper holomorphic maps from the complex unit ball to classical domains.
