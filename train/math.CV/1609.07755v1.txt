Let p(z)=a_0+a_1z+a_2z^2+a_3z^3+\cdots+a_nz^n be a polynomial of degree n, where the coefficients a_j, j \in \{0,1,2,\cdots n\}, may be complex. We impose some restriction on the coefficients of the real part of the given polynomial and then estimate the maximum number of zeros such polynomial can possibly have in a specified disk.
