This paper show that two doubly infinite series generate a totally nonnegative Hurwitz-type matrix if and only if their ratio represents an S-functions of a certain kind. The doubly infinite case needs a specific approach, since the ratios have no correspondent Stieltjes continued fraction. Another forthcoming publication (see Dyachenko, arXiv:1608.04440) offers a shorter improved version of this result as well as its application to the Hurwitz stability. Nevertheless, the proof presented here illustrates features of totally nonnegative Hurwitz-type matrices better.
