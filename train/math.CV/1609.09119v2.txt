In this paper we characterize sums of CR functions from competing CR structures in two scenarios. In one scenario the structures are conjugate and we are adding to the theory of pluriharmonic boundary values. In the second scenario the structures are related by projective duality considerations. In both cases we provide explicit vector field-based characterizations for two-dimensional circular domains satisfying natural convexity conditions.
