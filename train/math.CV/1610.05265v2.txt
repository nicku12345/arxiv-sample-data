Let T be a positive closed current of bidimension (1,1) with unit mass on the complex projective space \mathbb P^2. For \alpha > 2/5 and \beta = (2-2\alpha)/3 we show that if T has four point with Lelong number greater than \alpha, the upper level set E_{\beta}^+ (T) of points of T with Lelong number strictly larger than \beta is contained within a conic with the exception of at most one point.
