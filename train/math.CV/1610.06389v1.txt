The paper is devoted to the study of compositions of polyharmonic mappings in simply connected domains. More precisely, we determine necessary and sufficient conditions of polyharmonic mapping f such that f\circ F (resp. F\circ f) is l-harmonic for any analytic function (or harmonic mapping but not analytic, or q-harmonic mapping but not (q-1)-harmonic) F.
