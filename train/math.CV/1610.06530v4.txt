The Diederich--Forn\ae ss index has been introduced since 1977 to classify bounded pseudoconvex domains. In this article, we derive several intrinsic, geometric conditions on boundary of domains for arbitrary indexes. Many results, in the past, by various mathematicians estimated the index by assuming some properties of domains. Our motivation of this paper is, the other way around, to look for how the index effects properties and shapes of domains. Especially, we look for a necessary condition of all bounded pseudoconvex domains \Omega\subset\mathbb{C}^2 with the Diederich--Forn\ae ss index 1. We also show that, when the Levi-flat set of \partial\Omega is a closed Riemann surface, then the necessary condition can be simplified.
