For functions f(z)= z+ a_2 z^2 + a_3 z^3 + \cdots in various subclasses of normalized analytic functions, we consider the problem of estimating the generalized Zalcman coefficient functional \phi(f,n,m;\lambda):=|\lambda a_n a_m -a_{n+m-1}|. For all real parameters \lambda and  \beta<1, we provide the sharp upper bound of \phi(f,n,m;\lambda) for functions f satisfying \operatorname{Re}f'(z) > \beta and hence settles the open problem of estimating \phi(f,n,m;\lambda) recently proposed by Agrawal and Sahoo [S. Agrawal and S. k. Sahoo, On coefficient functionals associated with the Zalcman conjecture, arXiv preprint, 2016]. It is worth mentioning that the sharp estimations of \phi(f,n,m;\lambda) follow for starlike and convex functions of order \alpha (\alpha <1) when \lambda \leq 0. Moreover, for certain positive \lambda, the sharp estimation of \phi(f,n,m;\lambda) is given when f is a typically real function or a univalent function with real coefficients or is in some subclasses of close-to-convex functions.
