We consider a family M_t^n, with n\ge 2, t>1, of real hypersurfaces in a complex affine n-dimensional quadric arising in connection with the classification of homogeneous compact simply-connected real-analytic hypersurfaces in {\mathbb C}^n due to Morimoto and Nagano. To finalize their classification, one needs to resolve the problem of the embeddability of M_t^n in {\mathbb C}^n for n=3,7. In our earlier article we showed that M_t^7 is not embeddable in {\mathbb C}^7 for every t and that M_t^3 is embeddable in {\mathbb C}^3 for all 1<t<1+10^{-6}. In the present paper, we improve on the latter result by showing that the embeddability of M_t^3 in fact takes place for 1<t<\sqrt{(2+\sqrt{2})/3}. This is achieved by analyzing the explicit totally real embedding of the sphere S^3 in {\mathbb C}^3 constructed by Ahern and Rudin. For t\ge\sqrt{(2+\sqrt{2})/3} the problem of the embeddability of M_t^3 remains open.
