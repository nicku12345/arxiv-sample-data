In this article, we establish a truncated non-integrated defect relation for meromorphic mappings from an m-dimensional complete K\"{a}hler manifold into \mathbb P^n(\mathbb C) intersecting q hypersurfaces Q_1,...,Q_q in k-subgeneral position of degree d_i, i.e., the intersection of any k+1 hypersurfaces is emptyset. We will prove that  \sum_{i=1}^q\delta_f^{[u-1]}(Q_i)\le (k-n+1)(n+1)+\epsilon+\frac{\rho u(u-1)}{d},  where u is explicitly estimated and d is the least common multiple of d_i's. Our result generalizes and improves previous results. In the last part of this paper we will apply this result to study the distribution of the Gauss map of minimal surfaces.
