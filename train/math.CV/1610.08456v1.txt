Let f be an algebraically nondegenerate meromorphic mapping from \mathbb C^m into \mathbb P^n(\mathbb C) and let Q_1,...,Q_q be q hypersurfaces in \mathbb P^n(\mathbb C) of degree d_i, in N-subgeneral position. In this paper, we will prove that, for every \epsilon >0, there exists a positive integer M such that ||\ (q-(N-n+1)(n+1)-\epsilon) T_f(r)\le\sum_{i=1}^q\frac{1}{d_i}N^{[M]}(r,f^*Q_i)+o(T_f(r)). Moreover, an explicit estimate for M is given. Our result is an extension of the previous second main theorem for the mappings and moving hyperplanes or moving hypersurfaces.
