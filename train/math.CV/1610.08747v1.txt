Let \Om be a unbounded domain in a Banach space. In this work, we wish to impose {\it local conditions} on boundary point of \Om (including the point at infinity) that guarantee complete hyperbolic of \Om. We also search for local boundary conditions so that Vitali properties hold true for \Om. These properties might be considered as analogues of the taut property in the finite dimensional case.
