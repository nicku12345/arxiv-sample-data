In this paper, a non-integrated defect relation for meromorphic maps from complete K\"ahler manifolds M into smooth projective algebraic varieties V intersecting hypersurfaces located in k-subgeneral position is proved. The novelty of this result lies in that both the upper bound and the truncation level of our defect relation depend only on k, \dim_{\,\mathbb{C}}(V) and the degrees of the hypersurfaces considered. In addition, this defect relation recovers Hirotaka Fujimoto [Theorem 1.1; MR0884636 (88m:32049); Japan. J. Math. (N.S.) 11 (1985), no. 2, 233-264.] when subjected to the same conditions.
