Let {\cal F} be a family of meromorphic functions on a domain D. We present a quite general sufficient condition for {\cal F} to be a normal family. This criterion contains many known results as special cases. The overall idea is that certain comparatively weak conditions on {\cal F} locally lead to somewhat stronger conditions, which in turn lead to even stronger conditions on the limit function g in the famous Zalcman Lemma. Ultimately, the defect relations for g force normality of {\cal F}.
