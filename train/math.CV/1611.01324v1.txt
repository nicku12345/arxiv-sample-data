In this paper we generalize the result on Fueter's theorem from [10] by Eelbode et al. to the case of monogenic functions in biaxially symmetric domains. To obtain this result, Eelbode et al. used representation theory methods but their result also follows from a direct calculus we established in our paper [21]. In this paper we first generalize [21] to the biaxial case and derive the main result from that.
