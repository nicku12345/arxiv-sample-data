We introduce and discuss some basic properties of some integral transforms in the framework of specific functional Hilbert spaces, the holomorphic Bargmann-Fock spaces on \mathbb{C} and \mathbb{C}^2 and the slice hyperholomorphic Bargmann-Fock space on \mathbb{H}. The first one is a natural integral transform mapping isometrically the standard Hilbert space on the real line into the two-dimensional Bargmann-Fock space. It is obtained as composition of the one and two dimensional Segal-Bargmann transforms and reduces further to an extremely integral operator that looks like a composition operator of the one-dimensional Segal-Bargmann transform with a specific symbol. We study its basic properties, including the identification of its image and the determination of a like-left inverse defined on the whole two-dimensional Bargmann-Fock space. We also examine their combination with the Fourier transform which lead to special integral transforms connecting the two-dimensional Bargmann-Fock space and its analogue on the complex plane. We also investigate the relationship between special subspaces of the two-dimensional Bargmann-Fock space and the slice-hyperholomorphic one on the quaternions by introducing appropriate integral transforms. We identify their image and their action on the reproducing kernel.
