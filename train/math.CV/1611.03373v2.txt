Let M be a (bounded or not) domain of C^n which is complete with respect to a K\"ahler metric, or more generally, a complete K\"ahler manifold with trivial canonical bundle. Let f be a linearly nondegenerate meromorphic map from M to the complex projective space P^m. Under an assumption on the positivity of the pull-back by f of the Fubini-Study form on P^m, we prove that f can not omit a certain number of hyperplanes in subgeneral position in P^m. This is deduced directly from a non-integrated defect relation for such f which generalizes that obtained by Fujimoto in the case where M is a ball.
