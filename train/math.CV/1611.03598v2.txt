Equidistribution of the orbits of points, subvarieties or of periodic points in complex dynamics is a fundamental problem. It is often related to strong ergodic properties of the dynamical system and to a deep understanding of analytic cycles, or more generally positive closed currents, of arbitrary dimension and degree. The later topic includes the study of the potentials and super-potentials of positive closed currents, their intersection with or without dimension excess. In this paper, we will survey some results and tools developed during the last two decades. Related concepts, new techniques and open problems will be presented.
