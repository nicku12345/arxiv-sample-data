We study holomorphic foliations tangent to singular real-analytic Levi-flat hypersurfaces in compact complex manifolds of complex dimension two. We give some hypotheses to guarantee the existence of dicritical singularities of these objects. As consequence, we give some applications to holomorphic foliations tangent to real-analytic Levi-flat hypersurfaces with singularities in \mathbb{P}^2.
