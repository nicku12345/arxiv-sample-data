For 0<p<\infty  and \alpha >-1 the space of Dirichlet type \mathcal D^p_\alpha  consists of those functions f which are analytic in the unit disc \mathbb D and satisfy \int_{\mathbb D}(1-| z| )^\alpha| f^\prime (z)| ^p\,dA(z)<\infty . The space \Dp is the closest one to the Hardy space H^p among all the \mathcal D^p_\alpha . Our main object in this paper is studying similarities and differences between the spaces H^p and \Dp (0<p<\infty ) regarding superposition operators. Namely, for 0<p<\infty  and 0<s<\infty , we characterize the entire functions \varphi  such that the superposition operator S_\varphi  with symbol \varphi  maps the conformally invariant space Q_s into the space \Dp, and, also, those which map \Dp into Q_s and we compare these results with the corresponding ones with H^p in the place of \Dp. We also study the more general question of characterizing the superposition operators mapping \mathcal D^p_\alpha  into Q_s and Q_s into \mathcal D^p_\alpha , for any admissible triplet of numbers (p, \alpha , s).
