In 1984, Gehring and Pommerenke proved that if the Schwarzian derivative S(f) of a locally univalent analytic function f in the unit disk satisfies that \limsup_{|z|\to 1} |S(f)(z)| (1-|z|^2)^2 < 2, then there exists a positive integer N such that f takes every value at most N times. Recently, Becker and Pommerenke have shown that the same result holds in those cases when the function f satisfies that \limsup_{|z|\to 1} |f"(z)/f'(z)|\, (1-|z|^2)< 1.   In this paper, we generalize these two criteria for bounded valence of analytic functions to the cases when f is merely harmonic.
