A slice regular analogue of the Malmquist-Takenaka system is investigated. It is proved that they form a complete orthonormal system in the quaternionic Hardy spaces of the unit ball. The properties of associated projection operator are studied.   Key Words and Phrases: Functions of hypercomplex variables, quaternionic Hardy spaces, series expansions, interpolation, approximation by rational functions, quaternionic Malmquist-Takenaka system
