In this note, we give explicit examples of compact complex 3-folds which admit automorphisms that are isotopic to the identity through C \infty-diffeomorphisms but not through biholomorphisms. These automorphisms play an important role in the construction of the Te-ichm{\"u}ller stack of higher dimensional manifolds.
