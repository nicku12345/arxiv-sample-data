We consider hypersurfaces of finite type in a direct product space {\mathbb R}^2 \times {\mathbb R}^2, which are analogues to real hypersurfaces of finite type in {\mathbb C}^2. We shall consider separately the cases where such hypersurfaces are regular and singular, in a sense that corresponds to Levi degeneracy in hypersurfaces in {\mathbb C}^2. For the regular case, we study formal normal forms and prove convergence by following Chern and Moser. The normal form of such an hypersurface, considered as the solution manifold of a 2nd order ODE, gives rise to a normal form of the corresponding 2nd order ODE. For the degenerate case, we study normal forms for weighted \ell-jets. Furthermore, we study the automorphisms of finite type hypersurfaces.
