In this paper we study the regularity of the Szeg\H{o} projection on Lebesgue and Sobolev spaces on the distinguished boundary of the unbounded model worm domain D_\beta.   We denote by d_b(D_\beta) the distinguished boundary of D_\beta and define the corresponding Hardy space \mathscr{H}^2(D_\beta). This can be identified with a closed subspace of L^2(d_b(D_\beta),d\sigma), that we denote by \mathscr{H}^2(d_b(D_\beta)), where d\sigma is the naturally induced measure on d_b(D_\beta).   The orthogonal Hilbert space projection \mathscr{P}: L^2(d_b(D_\beta),d\sigma)\to \mathscr{H}^2(d_b(D_\beta)) is called the Szeg\H{o} projection on the distinguished boundary.   We prove that \mathscr{P}, initially defined on the dense subspace L^2(d_b( D_\beta),d\sigma)\cap L^p(d_b(D_\beta), d\sigma) extends to a bounded operator \mathscr{P}: L^p(d_b(D_\beta), d\sigma)\to L^p(d_b(D_\beta), d\sigma) if and only if \textstyle{\frac{2}{1+\nu_\beta}}<p<\textstyle{\frac{2}{1-\nu_\beta}} where \nu_\beta=\textstyle{\frac{\pi}{2\beta-\pi}},\beta>\pi. Furthermore, we also prove that \mathscr{P} defines a bounded operator \mathscr{P}: W^{s,2}(d_b(D_\beta),d\sigma)\to W^{s,2}(d_b(D_\beta), d\sigma) if and only if 0\leq s<\textstyle{\frac{\nu_\beta}{2}} where W^{s.2}(d_b( D_\beta), d\sigma) denotes the Sobolev space of order s and underlying L^2-norm.   Finally, we prove a necessary condition for the boundedness of \mathscr{P} on W^{s,p}(d_b(D_\beta), d\sigma), p\in(1,\infty), the Sobolev space of order s and underlying L^p-norm.
