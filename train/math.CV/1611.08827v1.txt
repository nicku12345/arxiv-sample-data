In this paper we prove that, for any n\in \mathbb N, the ideal generated by n slice regular functions f_1,\ldots,f_n having no common zeros concides with the entire ring of slice regular functions. The proof required the study of the non-commutative syzygies of a vector of regular functions, that manifest a different character when compared with their complex counterparts.
