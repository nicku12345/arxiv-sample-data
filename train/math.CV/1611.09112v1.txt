We study the regularity of infinitesimal CR automorphisms of abstract CR structures which possess a certain microlocal extension and show that there are smooth multipliers, completely determined by the CR structure, such that if X is such an infinitesimal CR automorphism, then \lambda X is smooth for all multipliers \lambda. As an application, we study the regularity of infinitesimal automorphisms of certain embedded hypersurfaces of infinite type.
