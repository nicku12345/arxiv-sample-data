The Bohr inequality, first introduced by Harald Bohr in 1914, deals with finding the largest radius r, 0<r<1, such that \sum_{n=0}^\infty |a_n|r^n \leq 1 holds whenever |\sum_{n=0}^\infty a_nz^n|\leq 1 in the unit disk \mathbb{D} of the complex plane. The exact value of this largest radius, known as the \emph{Bohr radius}, has been established to be 1/3. This paper surveys recent advances and generalizations on the Bohr inequality. It discusses the Bohr radius for certain power series in \mathbb{D}, as well as for analytic functions from \mathbb{D} into particular domains. These domains include the punctured unit disk, the exterior of the closed unit disk, and concave wedge-domains. The analogous Bohr radius is also studied for harmonic and starlike logharmonic mappings in \mathbb{D}. The Bohr phenomenon which is described in terms of the Euclidean distance is further investigated using the spherical chordal metric and the hyperbolic metric. The exposition concludes with a discussion on the n-dimensional Bohr radius.
