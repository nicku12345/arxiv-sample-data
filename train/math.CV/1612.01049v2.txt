Let n\geq 2. In this paper, we obtain approximation properties of various families of normalized univalent mappings f on the Euclidean unit ball \mathbb{B}^n in \mathbb{C}^n by automorphisms of \mathbb{C}^n whose restrictions to \mathbb{B}^n have the same geometric property of f. First, we obtain approximation properties of spirallike, convex and g-starlike mappings f on \mathbb{B}^n by automorphisms of \mathbb{C}^n whose restrictions to \mathbb{B}^n have the same geometric property of f, respectively. Next, for a nonresonant operator A with m(A)>0, we obtain an approximation property ofmappings which have A-parametric representation by automorphisms of \mathbb{C}^n whose restrictions to \mathbb{B}^n have A-parametric representation. Certain questions will be also mentioned. Finally, we obtain an approximation property by automorphisms of \mathbb{C}^n for a subset of S_{I_n}^0(\mathbb{B}^n) consisting of mappings f which satisfy the condition \|Df(z)-I_n\|<1, z\in\mathbb{B}^n. Related results will be also obtained.
