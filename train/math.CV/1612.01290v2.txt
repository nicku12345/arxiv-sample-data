The purpose of the paper is to study some problems raised by Hayman and Gundersen about the existence of non-trivial entire and meromorphic solutions for the Fermat type functional equation f^n+g^n+h^n=1. Hayman showed that no non-trivial meromorphic solutions and entire solutions exist when n \ge 9 and n \ge 7 respectively. By considering the entire holomorphic curves on the Fermat surface defined by X^n+Y^n+Z^n=W^n on the complex projective space \mathbb{P}^3 and applying the method of jet differentials, we show that no non-trivial meromorphic solutions and entire solutions exist when n \ge 8 and n \ge 6 respectively. In particular, this completes the investigation of non-trivial entire solutions for all n and respectively, meromorphic solutions for all cases except for n=7. Finally, for the generalized Fermat type functional equation f^n+g^m+h^l=1, we will also prove the non-existence of non-trivial meromorphic solutions when 1/n+1/m+1/l \le 3/8, giving the strongest result obtained so far.
