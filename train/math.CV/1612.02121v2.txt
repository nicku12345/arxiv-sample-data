We prove that if X = X_1 \times \dots \times X_n is a product of hyperbolic Riemann surfaces of finite type and Y = \Omega/\Gamma is a complex manifold, where \Omega is a bounded simply-connected domain in \mathbb{C}^m, then the space of dominant holomorphic mappings from X to Y is a finite set. As corollaries, we obtain the finiteness of the space of dominant holomorphic mappings into products and symmetric products of hyperbolic Riemann surfaces.
