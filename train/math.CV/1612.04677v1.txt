In their seminal paper, Berman and Boucksom exploited ideas from complex geometry to analyze asymptotics of spaces of holomorphic sections of tensor powers of certain line bundles L over compact, complex manifolds as the power grows. This yielded results on weighted polynomial spaces in weighted pluripotential theory in \Bbb{C}^d. Here, motivated from Bayraktar's recent paper, we work in the setting of weighted pluripotential theory arising from polynomials associated to a convex body in (\Bbb{R}^+)^d. These classes of polynomials need not occur as sections of tensor powers of a line bundle L over a compact, complex manifold. We follow the approach in Berman and Boucksom's work to recover analogous results.
