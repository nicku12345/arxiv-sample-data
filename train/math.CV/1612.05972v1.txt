In the space of all entire functions it is solved the problem of interpolation taking into account multiplicities by sums of the series of exponentials with the exponents from a given set. It is found a criterion of solubility of the problem in the case when all infinite portions of interpolation nodes are situated on a finite system of rays. It is also disclosed that the problem is equivalent to particular problems of simple interpolation, as well as of point-wise crude approximation, by sums of the series of exponentials.
