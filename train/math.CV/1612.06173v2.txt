In this paper we generalize to a certain class of Stein manifolds the Bernstein-Walsh-Siciak theorem which describes the equivalence between possible holomorphic continuation of a function f defined on a compact set K in \mathbb{C}^N to the rapidity of the best uniform approximation of f on K by polynomials. We also generalize Winiarski's theorem which relates the growth rate of an entire function f on \mathbb{C}^N to its best uniform approximation by polynomials on a compact set.
