We highlight an intrinsic connection between classical quadrature domains and the well-studied theme of removable singularities of analytic sets in several complex variables. Exploiting this connection provides a new framework to recover several basic properties of such domains, namely the algebraicity of their boundary, a better understanding of the associated defining polynomial and the possible boundary singularities that can occur.
