For an open set V\subset\mathbb{C}^n, denote by \mathscr{M}_{\alpha}(V) the family of \alpha-analytic functions that obey a boundary maximum modulus principle. We prove that, on a bounded domain \Omega\subset \mathbb{C}^n, with continuous boundary (that in each variable separately allows a solution to the Dirichlet problem), a function f \in \mathscr{M}_{\alpha}(\Omega\setminus f^{-1}(0)) automatically satisfies f\in \mathscr{M}_{\alpha}(\Omega), if it is C^{\alpha_j-1}-smooth, in the z_j variable, \alpha\in \mathbb{Z}^n_+, up to the boundary. For a submanifold U\subset \mathbb{C}^n, denote by \mathfrak{M}_{\alpha}(U) the set of functions locally approximable by \alpha-analytic functions where each approximating member and its reciprocal (off the singularities) obey the boundary maximum modulus principle. We prove, that for a C^3-smooth hypersurface, \Omega, a member of \mathfrak{M}_{\alpha}(\Omega), cannot have constant modulus near a point where the Levi form has a positive eigenvalue, unless it is there the trace of a polyanalytic function of a simple form.
