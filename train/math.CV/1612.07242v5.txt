A conjecture of Bombieri states that the coefficients of a normalized univalent function f should satisfy  \liminf_{f\to K} \frac{n-{\rm Re\,}a_n}{m-{\rm Re\,}a_m} = \min_{t\in{\mathbb R}} \, \frac{n\sin t -\sin(nt)}{m\sin t -\sin(mt)},  when f approaches the Koebe function K(z)=\frac{z}{(1-z)^2}. Recently, Leung disproved this conjecture for n=2 and for all m\geq3 and, also, for n=3 and for all odd m\geq5. Complementing his work we disprove it for all m>n\geq2 which are simultaneously odd or even and, also, for the case when m is odd, n is even and n\leq \frac{m+1}{2}. We mostly make use of trigonometry, but also employ Dieudonn\'e's criterion for the univalence of polynomials.
