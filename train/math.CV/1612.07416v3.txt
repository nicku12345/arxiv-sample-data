In this paper, we study q-difference analogues of several central results in value distribution theory of several complex variables such as q-difference versions of the logarithmic derivative lemma, the second main theorem for hyperplanes and hypersurfaces, and a Picard type theorem. Moreover, the Tumura-Clunie theorem concerning partial q-difference polynomials is also obtained. Finally, we apply this theory to investigate the growth of meromorphic solutions of linear partial q-difference equations.
