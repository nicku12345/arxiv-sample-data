Let M be a compact, pseudoconvex-oriented, (2n+1)-dimensional, abstract CR manifold of hypersurface type, n\geq 2. We prove the following:   (i) If M admits a strictly CR-plurisubharmonic function on (0,q_0)-forms, then the complex Green operator G_q exists and is continuous on L^2_{0,q}(M) for degrees q_0\le q\le n-q_0. In the case that q_0=1, we also establish continuity for G_0 and G_n. Additionally, the \bar\partial_b-equation on M can be solved in C^\infty(M).   (ii) If M satisfies "a weak compactness property" on (0,q_0)-forms, then G_q is a continuous operator on H^s_{0,q}(M) and is therefore globally regular on M for degrees q_0\le q\le n-q_0; and also for the top degrees q=0 and q=n in the case q_0=1.   We also introduce the notion of a "plurisubharmonic CR manifold" and show that it generalizes the notion of "plurisubharmonic defining function" for a a domain in \mathbb C^N and implies that M satisfies the weak compactness property.
