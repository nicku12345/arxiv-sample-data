The purpose of this paper is to establish local regularity of the solution operator to the Kohn-Laplace equation, called the complex Green operator, on abstract CR manifolds of hypersurface type. For a cut-off function \sigma, we introduce the \sigma-superlogarithmic property, a potential theoretical condition on CR manifolds. We prove that if the given datum is smooth on an open set containing the support of \sigma then the solution is smooth on the interior of \{x\in M:\sigma(x)=1\}. Furthermore, we also study the smoothness of the integral kernel of the complex Green operator.
