If \mu  is a positive Borel measure on the interval [0, 1) we let \mathcal H_\mu  be the Hankel matrix \mathcal H_\mu =(\mu_{n, k})_{n,k\ge 0} with entries \mu_{n, k}=\mu_{n+k}, where, for n\,=\,0, 1, 2, \dots , \mu_n denotes the moment of orden n of \mu . This matrix induces formally the operator \mathcal{H}_\mu (f)(z)= \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\left(\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \mu_{n,k}{a_k}\right)z^n on the space of all analytic functions f(z)=\sum_{k=0}^\infty a_kz^k, in the unit disc \D . This is a natural generalization of the classical Hilbert operator. The action of the operators H_{\mu } on Hardy spaces has been recently studied. This paper is devoted to study the operators H_\mu  acting on certain conformally invariant spaces of analytic functions on the disc such as the Bloch space, BMOA, the analytic Besov spaces, and the Q_s spaces.
