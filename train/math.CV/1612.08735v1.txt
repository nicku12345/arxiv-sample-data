In the present paper we introduce and investigate an interesting subclass K_{s}^{(k)}({\gamma},p) of analytic and p-valently close-to-convex functions in the open unit disk U. For functions belonging to this class, we derive several properties as the inclusion relationships and distortion theorems. The various results presented here would generalize many known recent results.
