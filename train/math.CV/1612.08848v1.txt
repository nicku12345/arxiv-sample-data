Given a fixed-point free compact holomorphic self-map f on a bounded symmetric domain D, which may be infinite dimensional, we establish the existence of a family \{H(\xi, \lambda)\}_{\lambda >0} of convex f-invariant domains at a point \xi in the boundary \partial D of D, which generalises completely Wolff's theorem for the open unit disc in \mathbb{C}. Further, we construct horoballs at \xi and show that they are exactly the f-invariant domains when D is of finite rank. Consequently, we show in the latter case that the limit functions of the iterates (f^n) with weakly closed range all accumulate in one single boundary component of \partial D.
