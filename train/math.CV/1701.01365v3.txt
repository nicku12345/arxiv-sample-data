M. Crouzeix formulated the following conjecture in (Integral Equations Operator Theory 48, 2004, 461--477): For every square matrix A and every polynomial p,    \|p(A)\| \le 2 \max_{z\in W(A)}|p(z)|,  where W(A) is the numerical range of A. We show that the conjecture holds in its strong, completely bounded form, i.e., where p above is allowed to be any matrix-valued polynomial, for all tridiagonal 3\times 3 matrices with constant main diagonal:    \left[\begin{matrix}a&b_1&0\\c_1&a&b_2\\0&c_2&a\end{matrix}\right],\qquad a,b_k,c_k\in\mathbb C,  or equivalently, for all complex 3\times 3 matrices with elliptic numerical range and one eigenvalue at the center of the ellipse. We also extend the main result of D. Choi in (Linear Algebra Appl. 438, 3247--3257) slightly.
