Skoda's 1972 result on ideal generation is a crucial ingredient in the analytic approach to the finite generation of the canonical ring and the abundance conjecture. Special analytic techniques developed by Skoda, other than applications of the usual vanishing theorems and L2 estimates for the d-bar equation, are required for its proof. This note (which is part of a lecture given in the 60th birthday conference for Lawrence Ein) gives a simpler, more straightforward proof of Skoda's result, which makes it a natural consequence of the standard techniques in vanishing theorems and solving d-bar equation with L2 estimates. The proof involves the following three ingredients: (i) one particular Cauchy-Schwarz inequality for tensors with a special factor which accounts for the exponent of the denominator in the formulation of the integral condition for Skoda's ideal generation, (ii) the nonnegativity of Nakano curvature of the induced metric of a special co-rank-1 subbundle of a trivial vector bundle twisted by a special scalar weight function, and (iii) the vanishing theorem and solvability of d-bar equation with L2 estimates for vector bundles of nonnegative Nakano curvature on a strictly pseudoconvex domain. Our proof gives readily other similar results on ideal generation.
