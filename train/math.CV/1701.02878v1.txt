We survey the recent developments in the theory of quasireg- ular mappings in metric spaces. In particular, we study the geometric porosity of the branch set of quasiregular mappings in general metric measure spaces, and then, introduce the various natural definitions of quasiregular mappings in general metric measure spaces, and give con- ditions under which they are quantitatively equivalent.
