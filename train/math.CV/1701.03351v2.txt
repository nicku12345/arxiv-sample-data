In this paper, we prove some fundamental theorems for holomorphic curves on angular domain intersecting a hypersurface, finite set of fixed hyperplanes in general position and finite set of fixed hypersurfaces in general position on complex projective variety with the level of truncation. As applications of the second main theorems for an angle, we will discuss the uniqueness problem of holomorphic curves in an angle instead of the whole complex plane. Detail, we establish a result for uniqueness problem of holomorphic curve by inverse image of a hypersurface. In my knowledge, this is the first result for uniqueness problem of holomorphic curve by inverse image of hypersurface on angular domain. On complex plane, we obtain a uniqueness result for holomorphic curves, it is improvement of some results before [5, 10] in this trend.
