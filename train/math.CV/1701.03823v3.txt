Having been unclear how to define that a domain is strongly, or strictly pseudoconvex in the infinite-dimensional setting, we first focus on finite dimension and eliminate the need of two degrees of differentiability of the boundary of a domain, since differentiable functions are difficult to find in infinite dimension. We introduce \ell-strict pseudoconvexity for \ell\geq 1 and \ell-uniform pseudoconvexity for \ell\geq 0. Defining \ell-strict pseudoconvexity and \ell-uniform pseudoconvexity for \ell<2 depends on extending a notion of strict plurisubharmonicity to cases lacking C^2-smoothness, first studying it in the sense of distribution and then considering it in infinite dimension. Examples of strictly plurisubharmonic functions as well as \ell-uniformly pseudoconvex domains for \ell<2 are presented.
