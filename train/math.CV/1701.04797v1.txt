We consider row sequences of (type II) Hermite-Pad\'e approximations with common denominator associated with a vector {\bf f} of formal power expansions about the origin. In terms of the asymptotic behavior of the sequence of common denominators, we describe some analytic properties of {\bf f} and restate some conjectures corresponding to questions once posed by A. A. Gonchar for row sequences of Pad\'e approximants.
