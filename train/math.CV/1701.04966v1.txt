In this paper, we prove a normal criteria for family of meromorphic functions. As an application of that result, we establish a uniqueness theorem for entire function concerning a conjecture of R. Bruck. The above uniqueness theorem is an improvement of a problem studied by L. Z. Yang et. al [14]. However, our method differs the method of L. Z. Yang et. al [14]. We mainly use normal family theory and combine it with Nevanlinna theory instead of using only the Nevanlinna theory as in [14].
