Let {\mathcal U}(\lambda) denote the family of analytic functions f(z), f(0)=0=f'(0)-1, in the unit disk \ID, which satisfy the condition \big |\big (z/f(z)\big )^{2}f'(z)-1\big |<\lambda  for some 0<\lambda \leq 1. The logarithmic coefficients \gamma_n of f are defined by the formula \log(f(z)/z)=2\sum_{n=1}^\infty \gamma_nz^n. In a recent paper, the present authors proposed a conjecture that if f\in {\mathcal U}(\lambda) for some 0<\lambda \leq 1, then |a_n|\leq \sum_{k=0}^{n-1}\lambda ^k for n\geq 2 and provided a new proof for the case n=2. One of the aims of this article is to present a proof of this conjecture for n=3, 4 and an elegant proof of the inequality for n=2, with equality for f(z)=z/[(1+z)(1+\lambda z)]. In addition, the authors prove the following sharp inequality for f\in{\mathcal U}(\lambda): \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}|\gamma_{n}|^{2} \leq \frac{1}{4}\left(\frac{\pi^{2}}{6}+2{\rm Li\,}_{2}(\lambda)+{\rm Li\,}_{2}(\lambda^{2})\right),  where {\rm Li}_2 denotes the dilogarithm function. Furthermore, the authors prove two such new inequalities satisfied by the corresponding logarithmic coefficients of some other subfamilies of \mathcal S.
