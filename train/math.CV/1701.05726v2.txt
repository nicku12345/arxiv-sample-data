Sto\"ilow's theorem from 1928 states that a continuous, open, and light map between surfaces is a discrete map with a discrete branch set. This result implies that such maps between orientable surfaces are locally modeled by power maps z\mapsto z^k and admit a holomorphic factorization.   The purpose of this expository article is to give a proof of this classical theorem having readers in mind that are interested in continuous, open and discrete maps.
