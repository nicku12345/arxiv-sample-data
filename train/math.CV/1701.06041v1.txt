In this article, we determine the radius of univalence of sections of normalized univalent harmonic mappings for which the range is convex (resp. starlike, close-to-convex, convex in one direction). Our result on the radius of univalence of section s_{n,n}(f) is sharp especially when the corresponding mappings have convex range. In this case, each section s_{n,n}(f) is univalent in the disk of radius 1/4 for all n\geq2, which may be compared with classical result of Szeg\"{o} on conformal mappings.
