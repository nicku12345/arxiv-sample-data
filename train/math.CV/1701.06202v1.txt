The estimates of the uniform norm of the Chebyshev polynomials associated with a compact set K in the complex plane are established. These estimates are exact (up to a constant factor) in the case where K consists of a finite number of quasiconformal curves or arcs. The case where K is a uniformly perfect subset of the real line is also studied.
