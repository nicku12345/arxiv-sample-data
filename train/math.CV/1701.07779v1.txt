Assume that \Delta is the open unit disk in the complex plane and \mathcal{A} is the class of normalized analytic functions in \Delta. In this paper we introduce and study the class \begin{equation*}   \mathcal{BS}(\alpha):=\left\{f\in \mathcal{A}: \left(\frac{zf'(z)}{f(z)}-1\right)\prec \frac{z}{1-\alpha z^2}, \, z\in\Delta\right\}, \end{equation*} where 0\leq\alpha\leq1 and \prec is the subordination relation. Some properties of this class like differential subordination, coefficients estimates and Fekete-Szeg\"{o} inequality associated with the k-th root transform are considered.
