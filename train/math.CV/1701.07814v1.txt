For any real numbers b,c\in\mathbb{R}, we form the sequence of polynomials \left\{ H_{m}(z)\right\} _{m=0}^{\infty} satisfying the four-term recurrence \[ H_{m}(z)+cH_{m-1}(z)+bH_{m-2}(z)+zH_{m-3}(z)=0,\qquad m\ge3, \] with the initial conditions H_{0}(z)=1, H_{1}(z)=-c, and H_{2}(z)=-b+c^{2}. We find necessary and sufficient conditions on b and c under which the zeros of H_{m}(z) are real for all m, and provide an explicit real interval on which {\displaystyle \bigcup_{m=0}^{\infty}\mathcal{Z}(H_{m})} is dense where \mathcal{Z}(H_{m}) is the set of zeros of H_{m}(z).
