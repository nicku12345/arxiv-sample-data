Elliptic functions are largely studied and standardized mathematical objects. The two usual approaches are due to Jacobi and Weierstrass.   From a contour integral which allowed us to unify many summation formulae (Euler-MacLaurin, Poisson, Vorono\"i or Circle formulae), we will find the entirety of the elliptic functions, proposed either in the shape of Jacobi or Weierstrass. But with one translation which appears in their natural form.   What could seem a defect will lead us to a renormalisation of the elliptic functions making it possible to determine, in a rather simple way, a Fourier series representation and a factorization of these functions.
