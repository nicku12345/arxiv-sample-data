Along with the development of the theory of slice regular functions over the real algebra of quaternions \mathbb{H} during the last decade, some natural questions arose about slice regular functions on the open unit ball \mathbb{B} in \mathbb{H}. This work establishes several new results in this context. Along with some useful estimates for slice regular self-maps of \mathbb{B} fixing the origin, it establishes two variants of the quaternionic Schwarz-Pick lemma, specialized to maps \mathbb{B}\to\mathbb{B} that are not injective. These results allow a full generalization to quaternions of two theorems proven by Landau for holomorphic self-maps f of the complex unit disk with f(0)=0. Landau had computed, in terms of a:=|f'(0)|, a radius \rho such that f is injective at least in the disk \Delta(0,\rho) and such that the inclusion f(\Delta(0,\rho))\supseteq\Delta(0,\rho^2) holds. The analogous result proven here for slice regular functions \mathbb{B}\to\mathbb{B} allows a new approach to the study of Bloch-Landau-type properties of slice regular functions \mathbb{B}\to\mathbb{H}.
