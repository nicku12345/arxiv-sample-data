In this paper, there are obtained growth estimates of entire in \mathbb{C}^n function of bounded \mathbf{L}-index in joint variables. They describe the behaviour of maximum modulus of entire function on a skeleton in a polydisc by behaviour of the function \mathbf{L}(z)=(l_1(z),\ldots,l_n(z)), where for every j\in\{1,\ldots, n\} \ l_j:\mathbb{C}^n\to \mathbb{R}_+ is a continuous function. We generalised known results of W. K. Hayman, M. M. Sheremeta, A. D. Kuzyk, M. T. Borduyak, T. O. Banakh and V. O. Kushnir for a wider class of functions \mathbf{L}. One of our estimates is sharper even for entire in \mathbb{C} functions of bounded l-index than Sheremeta's estimate.
