In this paper we first recall the definition of an octonion algebra and its algebraic properties. We derive the so called e_4-calculus and using it we obtain the list of generalized Cauchy-Riemann systems in octonionic monogenic functions. We define some bilinear forms and derive the corresponding symmetry groups.
