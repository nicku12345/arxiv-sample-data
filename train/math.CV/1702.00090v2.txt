Let \mathscr J be the set of inner functions whose derivatives lie in Nevanlinna class. In this note, we show that the natural map F \to \text{Inn}(F'): \mathscr J/\text{Aut}(\mathbb{D}) \to \text{Inn}/S^1 is is injective but not surjective. More precisely, we show that that the image consists of all inner functions of the form BS_\mu where B is a Blaschke product and S_\mu is the singular factor associated to a measure \mu whose support is contained in a countable union of Beurling-Carleson sets. Our proof is based on extending the work of D. Kraus and O. Roth on maximal Blaschke products to allow for singular factors. This answers a question raised by K. Dyakonov.
