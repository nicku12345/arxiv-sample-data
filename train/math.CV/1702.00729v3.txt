We use a special version of the Corona Theorem in several variables, valid when all but one of the data functions are smooth, to generalize to the polydisc and to the ball results obtained by El Fallah, Kellay and Seip about cyclicity of non vanishing bounded holomorphic functions in large enough Banach spaces of analytic functions determined either by weighted sums of powers of Taylor coefficients or by radially weighted integrals of powers of the modulus of the function.
