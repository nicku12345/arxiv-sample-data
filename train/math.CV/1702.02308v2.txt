Let \mathscr T=(V, \mathcal E) be a leafless, locally finite rooted directed tree. We associate with \mathscr T a one parameter family of Dirichlet spaces \mathscr H_q~(q \geqslant 1), which turn out to be Hilbert spaces of vector-valued holomorphic functions defined on the unit disc \mathbb D in the complex plane. These spaces can be realized as reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces associated with the positive definite kernel \begin{eqnarray*} \kappa_{\mathscr H_q}(z, w) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{(1)_n}{(q)_n}\,{z^n \overline{w}^n} ~P_{\langle e_{\mathsf{root}}\rangle} + \sum_{v \in V_{\prec}} \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{(n_v +2)_n}{(n_v + q+1)_n}\, {z^n \overline{w}^n}~P_{v}~(z, w \in \mathbb D), \end{eqnarray*} where V_{\prec} denotes the set of branching vertices of \mathscr T, n_v denotes the depth of v \in V in \mathscr T, and P_{\langle e_{\mathsf{root}}\rangle}, ~P_{v}~(v \in V_{\prec}) are certain orthogonal projections. We also discuss some structural properties of the operator \mathscr M_{z, q} of multiplication by z on \mathscr H_q. Further, we discuss the question of unitary equivalence of operators \mathscr M^{(1)}_z and \mathscr M^{(2)}_z of multiplication by z on Dirichlet spaces \mathscr H_q associated with directed trees \mathscr T_1 and \mathscr T_2 respectively.
