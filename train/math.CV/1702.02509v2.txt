We prove that a meromorphic mapping, which sends a peace of a real analytic strictly pseudoconvex hypersurface in \cc^2 to a compact subset of \cc^N which doesn't contain germs of non-constant complex curves is continuous from the concave side of the hypersurface. This implies the analytic continuability along CR-paths of germs of holomorphic mappings from real analytic hypersurfaces with non-vanishing Levi form to the locally spherical ones in all dimensions.
