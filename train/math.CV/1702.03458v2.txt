A proof is reconstructed for a useful theorem on the zeros of derivatives of analytic functions due to H. M. Macdonald, which appears to be now little known. The Theorem states that, if a function f(z) is analytic inside a bounded region bounded by a contour on which the modulus of f(z) is constant, then the number of zeros (counted according to multiplicity) of f(z) and of its derivative in the region differ by unity.
