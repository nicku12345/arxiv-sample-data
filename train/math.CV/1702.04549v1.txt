In the present investigation, by applying two different normalizations of the Jackson and Hahn-Exton q-Bessel functions tight lower and upper bounds for the radii of convexity of the same functions are obtained. In addition, it was shown that these radii obtained are solutions of some transcendental equations. The known Euler-Rayleigh inequalities are intensively used in the proof of main results. Also, the Laguerre-P\'olya class of real entire functions plays an important role in this work.
