We show that there is an absolute constant c > 1/2 such that the Mahler measure of the Fekete polynomials f_p of the form f_p(z) := \sum_{k=1}^{p-1}{\left( \frac kp \right)z^k}\,, (where the coefficients are the usual Legendre symbols) is at least c\sqrt{p} for all sufficiently large primes p. This improves the lower bound \left(\frac 12 - \varepsilon\right)\sqrt{p} known before for the Mahler measure of the Fekete polynomials f_p for all sufficiently large primes p \geq c_{\varepsilon}. Our approach is based on the study of the zeros of the Fekete polynomials on the unit circle.
