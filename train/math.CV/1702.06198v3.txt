In signal processing the Rudin-Shapiro polynomials have good autocorrelation properties and their values on the unit circle are small. Binary sequences with low autocorrelation coefficients are of interest in radar, sonar, and communication systems. In this paper we study the oscillation of the modulus of the Rudin-Shapiro polynomials on the unit circle. We also show that the Rudin-Shapiro polynomials P_k and Q_k of degree n-1 with n := 2^k have o(n) zeros on the unit circle. This should be compared with a result of B. Conrey, A. Granville, B. Poonen, and K. Soundararajan stating that for odd primes p the Fekete polynomials f_p of degree p-1 have asymptotically \kappa_0 p zeros on the unit circle, where 0.500813>\kappa_0>0.500668. Our approach is based heavily on the Saffari and Montgomery conjectures proved recently by B. Rodgers. We also prove that there are absolute constants c_1 > 0 and c_2 > 0 such that the k-th Rudin-Shapiro polynomials P_k and Q_k of degree n-1 = 2^k-1 have at least c_2n zeros in the annulus \left \{z \in {\Bbb C}: 1 - \frac{c_1}{n} < |z| < 1 + \frac{c_1}{n} \right \}\,.
