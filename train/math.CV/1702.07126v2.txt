Let \Omega be a pseudoconvex domain in \mathbb C^n satisfying an f-property for some function f. We show that the Bergman metric associated to \Omega has the lower bound \tilde g(\delta_\Omega(z)^{-1}) where \delta_\Omega(z) is the distance from z to the boundary \partial\Omega and \tilde g is a specific function defined by f. This refines Khanh-Zampieri's work in \cite{KZ12} with reducing the smoothness assumption of the boundary.
