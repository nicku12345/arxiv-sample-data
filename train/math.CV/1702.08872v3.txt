We derive a new homotopy formula for a strictly pseudoconvex domain of C^2 boundary in {\mathbf C}^n by using a method of Lieb and Range and obtain estimates in Lipschitz spaces for the homotopy operators. For r>1 and q>0, we obtain a \Lambda_{r+{1}/{2}} solution u to \overline\partial u=f for \overline\partial-closed (0,q) forms f of class \Lambda_{r} on the domain. We apply the estimates to obtain boundary regularities of \mathcal D-solutions for a domain in the Levi-flat Euclidean space.
