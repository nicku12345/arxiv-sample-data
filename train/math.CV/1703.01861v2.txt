Let X be a, possibly non-reduced, analytic space of pure dimension. We introduce a notion of \overline{\partial}-equation on X and prove a Dolbeault-Grothendieck lemma. We obtain fine sheaves \mathcal{A}_X^q of (0,q)-currents, so that the associated Dolbeault complex yields a resolution of the structure sheaf \mathscr{O}_X. Our construction is based on intrinsic semi-global Koppelman formulas on X.
