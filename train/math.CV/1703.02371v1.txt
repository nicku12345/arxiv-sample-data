Let \mathcal{S}_H^0 denote the class of all functions f(z)=h(z)+\overline{g(z)}=z+\sum^\infty_{n=2} a_nz^n +\overline{\sum^\infty_{n=2} b_nz^n} that are sense-preserving, harmonic and univalent in the open unit disk |z|<1. The coefficient conjecture for \mathcal{S}_H^0 is still \emph{open} even for |a_2|. The aim of this paper is to show that if f=h+\overline{g} \in \mathcal{S}^0_H then  |a_n| < 5.24 \times 10^{-6} n^{17} and |b_n| < 2.32 \times 10^{-7}n^{17} for all n \geq 3. Making use of these coefficient estimates, we also obtain radius of univalence of sections of univalent harmonic mappings.
