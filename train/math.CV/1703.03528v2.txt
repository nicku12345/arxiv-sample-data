In this paper, we prove some difference analogue of second main theorems of meromorphic mapping from Cm into an algebraic variety V intersecting a finite set of fixed hypersurfaces in subgeneral position. As an application, we prove a result on algebraically degenerate of holomorphic curves intersecting hypersurfaces and difference analogue of Picard's theorem on holomorphic curves. Furthermore, we obtain a second main theorem of meromorphic mappings intersecting hypersurfaces in N-subgeneral position for Veronese embedding in Pn(C) and a uniqueness theorem sharing hypersurfaces.
