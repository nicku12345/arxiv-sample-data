For  -1 \leq B \leq 1 and A>B, let \mathcal{S}^*[A,B] denote the class of generalized Janowski starlike functions consisting of all normalized analytic functions f defined by the subordination z f'(z)/f(z) \prec (1+ A z)/(1+ B z) (|z|<1). For -1 \leq B \leq 1<A, we investigate the inverse coefficient problem for functions in the class \mathcal{S}^*[A,B] and its meromorphic counter part. Also, for  -1 \leq B \leq 1 < A , the sharp bounds for first five coefficients for inverse functions of generalized Janowski convex functions are determined. A simple and precise proof for inverse coefficient estimations for generalized Janowski convex functions is provided for the case A= 2 \beta -1 (\beta >1) and B=1. As an application, for F:=f^{-1}, A= 2 \beta -1 (\beta >1) and B=1, the sharp coefficient bounds of F/F' are obtained when f is a generalized Janowski starlike or generalized Janowski convex function. Further, we provide the sharp coefficient estimates for inverse functions of normalized analytic functions f satisfying f'(z) \prec (1+z)/(1+B z) (|z|<1, -1 \leq B < 1).
