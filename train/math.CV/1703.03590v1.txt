Sharp estimates on \beta are determined so that an analytic function p defined on the open unit disk in the complex plane normalized by p(0)=1 is subordinate to some well known starlike functions with positive real part whenever 1+\beta z p'(z), \,\,1+\beta z p'(z)/p(z), \,\,\mbox{or}\,\,1+\beta z p'(z)/p^{2}(z) is subordinate to \sqrt{1+z}. Our results provide sharp version of previously known results.
