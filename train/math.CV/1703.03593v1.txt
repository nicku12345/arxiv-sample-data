The convolution properties are discussed for the complex-valued harmonic functions in the unit disk \mathbb{D} constructed from the harmonic shearing of the analytic function \phi(z):=\int_0^z (1/(1-2\xi\textit{e}^{\textit{i}\mu}\cos\nu+\xi^2\textit{e}^{2\textit{i}\mu}))\textit{d}\xi, where \mu and \nu are real numbers. For any real number \alpha and harmonic function f=h+\overline{g}, define an analytic function f_{\alpha}:=h+\textit{e}^{-2\textit{i}\alpha}g. Let \mu_1 and \mu_2 (\mu_1+\mu_2=\mu) be real numbers, and f=h+\overline{g} and F=H+\overline{G} be locally-univalent and sense-preserving harmonic functions such that f_{\mu_1}*F_{\mu_2}=\phi. It is shown that the convolution f*F is univalent and convex in the direction of -\mu, provided it is locally univalent and sense-preserving. Also, local-univalence of the above convolution f*F is shown for some specific analytic dilatations of f and F. Furthermore, if g\equiv0 and both the analytic functions f_{\mu_1} and F_{\mu_2} are convex, then the convolution f*F is shown to be convex. These results extends the work done by Dorff \textit{et al.} to a larger class of functions.
