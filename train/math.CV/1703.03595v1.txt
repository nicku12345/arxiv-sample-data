We investigate the univalency and the directional convexity of the convolution \phi\tilde{*}f=\phi*h+\overline{\phi*g} of the harmonic mapping f=h+\bar{g} with a mapping \phi whose convolution with the mapping z+\sum_{k=2}^{\infty}k^nz^k is starlike (and such a mapping \phi is called n-starlike). In addition, we investigate the directional convexity of (i) the convolution of an analytic convex mapping with the slanted half-plane mapping, and (ii) the partial sums of the convolution of a 6-starlike mapping with the harmonic Koebe mapping and the harmonic half-plane mapping.
