Estimates for initial coefficients of Taylor-Maclaurin series of bi-univalent functions belonging to certain classes defined by subordination are obtained. Our estimates improve upon the earlier known estimates for second and third coefficient. The bound for the fourth coefficient is new. In addition, bound for the fifth coefficient is obtained for bi-starlike and strongly bi-starlike functions of order \rho and \beta respectively.
