We show that the convolution of the harmonic function f=h+\bar{g}, where h(z)+{e}^{-2{i}\gamma}g(z)=z/(1-{e}^{{i}\gamma}z) having analytic dilatation {e}^{{i}\theta} z^n (0\leq\theta<2\pi), with the mapping f_{a,\alpha}=h_{a,\alpha}+\overline{g}_{a,\alpha}, where h_{a,\alpha}(z)=(z/(1+a)-{e}^{{i}\alpha}z^2/2)/(1-{e}^{{i}\alpha}z)^2, g_{a,\alpha}(z)=(a {e}^{2{i}\alpha}z/(1+a)-{e}^{3{i}\alpha}z^2/2)/(1-{e}^{{i}\alpha}z)^2 is convex in the direction -(\alpha+\gamma). We also show that the convolution of f_{a,\alpha} with the right half-plane mapping having dilatation (a-z^2)/(1-az^2) is convex in the direction -\alpha. Finally, we introduce a family of univalent harmonic mappings and find out sufficient conditions for convexity along imaginary-axis of the linear combinations of harmonic functions of this family.
