We study the boundary behavior of the so-called ring Q-mappings obtained as a natural generalization of mappings with bounded distortion. We establish a series of conditions imposed on a function Q(x) for the continuous extension of given mappings with respect to prime ends in domains with regular boundaries in metric spaces.
