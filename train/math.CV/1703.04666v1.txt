Schottky groups are exactly those Kleinian groups providing the regular lowest planar uniformizations of closed Riemann surfaces and also the ones providing to the interior of a handlebody of a complete hyperbolic structure with injectivity radius bounded away from zero. The space parametrizing quasiconformal deformations of Schottky groups of a fixed rank g \geq 1 is the marked Schottky space {\mathcal M}{\mathcal S}_{g}; this being a complex manifold of dimension 3(g-1) for g \geq 2 and being isomorphic to the punctured unit disc for g=1. In this paper we provide a complete description of the real structures of {\mathcal M}{\mathcal S}_{g}, up to holomorphic automorphisms, together their real part.
