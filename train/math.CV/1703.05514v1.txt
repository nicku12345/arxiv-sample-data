In this paper, we give some extension of fundamental theorems in Nevanlinna - Cartan theory for holomorphic curve on M punctured complex planes. As an application, we establish a result for uniqueness problem of holomorphic curve by inverse image of a hypersurface, it is improvement of some results before [8, 14] in this trend.
