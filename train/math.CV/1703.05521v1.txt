We prove that some holomorphic functions on the moduli space of tori have only simple zeros. Instead of computing the derivative with respect to the moduli parameter \tau, we introduce a conceptual proof by applying Painlev\'{e} VI\ equation. As an application of this simple zero property, we obtain the smoothness of all the degeneracy curves of trivial critical points for some multiple Green function.
