This expository paper is concerned with the properties of proper holomorphic mappings between domains in complex affine spaces. We discuss some of the main geometric methods of this theory, such as the Reflection Principle, the scaling method, and the Kobayashi-Royden metric. We sketch the proofs of certain principal results and discuss some recent achievements. Several open problems are also stated.
