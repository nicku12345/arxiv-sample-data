The aim of this study is to understand to what extent a 1-convex domain with Levi-flat boundary is capable of holomorphic functions with slow growth. This paper discusses the case of the space of all the geodesic segments on a hyperbolic compact Riemann surface, which is a typical example of such a domain in the sense that its realization as a holomorphic disk bundle has the best possible Diederich-Fornaess index 1/2. Our main finding is an integral formula that produces holomorphic functions on the domain from holomorphic differentials on the base Riemann surface via optimal L^2-jet extension, and, in particular, it is shown that the weighted Bergman spaces of the domain is infinite dimensional for all the order greater than -1 beyond -1/2, the limiting order until which known L^2-estimates for the \overline{\partial}-equation work. Some applications are also given thanks to the generalized hypergeometric function _3F_2 expressing the norm of the optimal L^2-jet extension: a proof for the Liouvilleness which does not appeal to the ergodicity of the Levi foliation, and a Forelli-Rudin construction for the disk bundle over the Riemann surface.
