In this paper we prove that every Stein manifold S admits a proper holomorphic immersion into any Stein manifold X of dimension 2\mathrm{dim}S enjoying the density property or the volume density property. The case \mathrm{dim}S=1 was proved beforehand by Andrist and Wold (Ann. Inst. Fourier (Grenoble), 64(2):681-697, 2014). This result generalizes the classical theorem of Bishop and Narasimhan for immersions to \mathbb{C}^n with n=2\mathrm{dim}S, and it complements the proper embedding theorem proved by Andrist et al. when \mathrm{dim}X>2\mathrm{dim}S (J. Anal. Math., 130:135-150, 2016).
