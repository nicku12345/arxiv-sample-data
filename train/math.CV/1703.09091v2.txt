Let i\colon X\to \Pk^N be a projective manifold of dimension n embedded in projective space \Pk^N, and let L be the pull-back to X of the line bundle \Ok_{\Pk^N}(1). We construct global explicit Koppelman formulas on X for smooth (0,*)-forms with values in L^s for any s. %The formulas are intrinsic on X. The same construction works for singular, even non-reduced, X of pure dimension, if the sheaves of smooth forms are replaced by suitable sheaves \A_X^* of (0,*)-currents with mild singularities at X_{sing}. In particular, if s\ge \reg X -1, where \reg X is the Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity, we get an explicit %%% representation of the well-known vanishing of H^{0,q}(X, L^{s-q}), q\ge 1. Also some other applications are indicated.
