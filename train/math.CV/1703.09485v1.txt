In this paper, we obtain the upper bounds to the third Hankel determinants for starlike functions of order \alpha, convex functions of order \alpha and bounded turning functions of order \alpha. Furthermore, several relevant results on a new subclass of close-to-convex harmonic mappings are obtained. Connections of the results presented here to those that can be found in the literature are also discussed.
