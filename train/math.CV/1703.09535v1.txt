Let X be an open subset of \Bbb C^N, and let A be an n\times n matrix of holomorphic functions on X. We call a point \xi\in X \mathbf{Jordan} \mathbf{stable} for A if \xi is not a splitting point of the eigenvalues of A and, moreover, there is a neighborhood U of \xi such that, for each 1\le k\le n, the number of Jordan blocks of size k in the Jordan normal forms of A(\zeta) is the same for all \zeta\in U. H. Baumg\"artel (Analytic perturbation theory for matrices and operators, Birkh\"auser, 1985) proved that there is a nowhere dense closed analytic subset of X, which contains all points of X which are not Jordan stable for A. We give a new proof of this result. This proof has the advantage that the result can be obtained in a more precise form, and with some estimates. Also, this proof applies to arbitrary, possibly non-smooth, complex spaces X.
