We prove a realization formula and a model formula for analytic functions with modulus bounded by 1 on the symmetrized bidisc \[ G\stackrel{\rm def}{=} \{(z+w,zw): |z|<1, \, |w| < 1\}. \] As an application we prove a Pick-type theorem giving a criterion for the existence of such a function satisfying a finite set of interpolation conditions.
