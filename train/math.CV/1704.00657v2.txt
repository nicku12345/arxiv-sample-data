Let \mathcal{S} denote the class of analytic and univalent functions in \mathbb{D}:=\{z\in\mathbb{C}:\, |z|<1\} of the form f(z)= z+\sum_{n=2}^{\infty}a_n z^n. In this paper, we determine sharp estimates for the Toeplitz determinants whose elements are the Taylor coefficients of functions in \mathcal{S} and its certain subclasses. We also discuss similar problems for typically real functions.
