The k-Cauchy-Fueter operators and complexes are quaternionic counterparts of the Cauchy-Riemann operator and the Dolbeault complex in the theory of several complex variables. To develop the function theory of several quaternionic variables, we need to solve the non-homogeneous k-Cauchy-Fueter equation over a domain under the compatibility condition, which naturally leads to a Neumann problem. The method of solving the \overline{\partial}-Neumann problem in the theory of several complex variables is applied to this Neumann problem. We introduce notions of k-plurisubharmonic functions and k-pseudoconvex domains, establish the L^2 estimate and solve this Neumann problem over k-pseudoconvex domains in \mathbb{R}^4. Namely, we get a vanishing theorem for the first cohomology groups of the k-Cauchy-Fueter complex over such domains.
