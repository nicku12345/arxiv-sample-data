Let X be a connected open Riemann surface. Let Y be an Oka domain in the smooth locus of an analytic subvariety of \mathbb C^n, n\geq 1, such that the convex hull of Y is all of \mathbb C^n. Let \mathscr O_*(X, Y) be the space of nondegenerate holomorphic maps X\to Y. Take a holomorphic 1-form \theta on X, not identically zero, and let \pi:\mathscr O_*(X,Y) \to H^1(X,\mathbb C^n) send a map g to the cohomology class of g\theta. Our main theorem states that \pi is a Serre fibration. This result subsumes the 1971 theorem of Kusunoki and Sainouchi that both the periods and the divisor of a holomorphic form on X can be prescribed arbitrarily. It also subsumes two parametric h-principles in minimal surface theory proved by Forstneric and Larusson in 2016.
