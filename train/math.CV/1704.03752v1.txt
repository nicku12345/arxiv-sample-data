We study weighted composition operators acting between Fock spaces. The following results are obtained: (1) Criteria for the boundedness and compactness; (2) Characterizations of compact differences and essential norm; (3) Complete descriptions of path connected components and isolated points of the space of composition operators and the space of nonzero weighted composition operators.
