We obtain sharp weighted estimates for solutions of the equation \partial u = f in a lineally convex domain of finite type. Precisely we obtain estimates in the spaces L p (\Omega,\delta \gamma), \delta being the distance to the boundary, with two different types of hypothesis on the form f : first, if the data f belongs to L p \Omega,\delta \gamma \Omega , \gamma > --1, we have a mixed gain on the index p and the exponent \gamma; secondly we obtain a similar estimate when the data f satisfies an apropriate anisotropic L p estimate with weight \delta \gamma+1 \Omega. Moreover we extend those results to \gamma = --1 and obtain L p (\partial \Omega) and BMO(\partial \Omega) estimates. These results allow us to extend the L p (\Omega,\delta \gamma)-regularity results for weighted Bergman projection obtained in [CDM14b] for convex domains to more general weights.
