In this paper, we introduce and investigate two new subclasses of analytic functions in the open unit disk in the complex plane. Several interesting properties of the functions belonging to these classes are examined. Here, sufficient, and necessary and sufficient conditions for the functions belonging to these classes are also given. Moreover, coefficient bound estimates for the functions belonging to these classes are obtained.
