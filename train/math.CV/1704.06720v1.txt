The Schwarz lemma as one of the most influential results in complex analysis and it has a great impact to the development of several research fields, such as geometric function theory, hyperbolic geometry, complex dynamical systems, and theory of quasi-conformal mappings. In this note we mainly consider various version of Schwarz lemma and its relatives related to holomorphic functions including several variables.
