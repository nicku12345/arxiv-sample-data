The proofs of K. Oka's Coherence Theorems are based on Weierstrass' Preparation (division) Theorem. Here we formulate and prove a Weak Coherence Theorem without using Weierstrass' Preparation Theorem, but only with power series expansions: The proof is almost of linear algebra. Nevertheless, this simple Weak Coherence Theorem suffices to give other proofs of the Approximation, Cousin I/II, and Levi's (Hartogs' Inverse) Problems even in simpler ways than those known, as far as the domains are non-singular; they constitute the main basic part of the theory of several complex variables.   The new approach enables us to complete the proofs of those problems in quite an elementary way without Weierstrass' Preparation Theorem or the cohomology theory of Cartan--Serre, nor L2-dbar method of Hoermander.
