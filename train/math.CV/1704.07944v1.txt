Let \Omega be a domain in \mathbb{C} with hyperbolic metric \lambda_\Omega(z)|dz| of Gaussian curvature -4. Mejia and Minda proved in their 1990 paper that \Omega is (Euclidean) convex if and only if d(z,\partial\Omega)\lambda_\Omega(z)\ge1/2 for z\in\Omega, where d(z,\partial\Omega) denotes the Euclidean distance from z to the boundary \partial\Omega. In the present note, we will provide similar characterizations of spherically convex domains in terms of the spherical density of the hyperbolic metric.
