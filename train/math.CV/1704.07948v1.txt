We will provide sufficient conditions for the shifted hypergeometric function z_2F_1(a,b;c;z) to be a member of a specific subclass of starlike functions in terms of the complex parameters a,b and c. For example, we study starlikeness of order \alpha, \lambda-spirallikeness of order \alpha and strong starlikeness of order \alpha. In particular, those properties lead to univalence of the shifted hypergeometric functions on the unit disk.
