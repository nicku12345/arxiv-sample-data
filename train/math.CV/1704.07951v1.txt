A measurable function \mu on the unit disk \mathbb{D} of the complex plane with \|\mu\|_\infty<1 is sometimes called a Beltrami coefficient. We say that \mu is trivial if it is the complex dilatation f_{\bar z}/f_z of a quasiconformal automorphism f of \mathbb{D} satisfying the trivial boundary condition f(z)=z,~|z|=1. Since it is not easy to solve the Beltrami equation explicitly, to detect triviality of a given Beltrami coefficient is a hard problem, in general. In the present article, we offer a sufficient condition for a Beltrami coefficient to be trivial. Our proof is based on Betker's theorem on L\"owner chains.
