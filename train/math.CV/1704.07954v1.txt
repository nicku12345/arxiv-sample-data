We define a distance function on the bordered punctured disk 0<|z|\le 1/e in the complex plane, which is comparable with the hyperbolic distance of the punctured unit disk 0<|z|<1. As an application, we will construct a distance function on an n-times punctured sphere which is comparable with the hyperbolic distance. We also propose a comparable quantity which is not necessarily a distance function on the punctured sphere but easier to compute.
