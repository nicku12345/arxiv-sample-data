In this article we determine the coefficient bounds for functions in certain subclasses of analytic functions defined by subordination which are related to the well-known classes of starlike and convex functions. The main results deal with some open problems proposed by Q.H. Xu et al. [20,21]. An application of Jack lemma for certain subclass of starlike functions has been discussed.
