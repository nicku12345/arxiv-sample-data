In this article we consider functions f meromorphic in the unit disk. We give an elementary proof for a condition that is sufficient for the univalence of such functions. This condition simplifies and generalizes known conditions. We present some typical problems of geometrical function theory and give elementary solutions in the case of the above functions.
