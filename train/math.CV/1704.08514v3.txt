We prove that if an analytic map f:=(f_1,\ldots ,f_n):U\subset \mathbb{C}^n\rightarrow \mathbb{C}^n admits an algebraic addition theorem then there exists a meromorphic map g:=(g_1,\ldots ,g_n):\mathbb{C}^n\rightarrow \mathbb{C}^n admitting an algebraic addition theorem such that f_1,\ldots ,f_n are algebraic over \mathbb{C}(g_1,\ldots ,g_n) on U (this was proved by K. Weierstrass in dimension 1). Furthermore, (g_1,\ldots ,g_n) admits a rational addition theorem.
