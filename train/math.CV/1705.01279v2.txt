Consider a multiply-connected domain \Sigma in the sphere bounded by n non-intersecting quasicircles. We characterize the Dirichlet space of \Sigma as an isomorphic image of a direct sum of Dirichlet spaces of the disk under a generalized Faber operator. This Faber operator is constructed using a jump formula for quasicircles and certain spaces of boundary values.   Thereafter, we define a Grunsky operator on direct sums of Dirichlet spaces of the disk, and give a second characterization of the Dirichlet space of \Sigma as the graph of the generalized Grunsky operator in direct sums of the space \mathcal{H}^{1/2}(\mathbb{S}^1) on the circle. This has an interpretation in terms of Fourier decompositions of Dirichlet space functions on the circle.
