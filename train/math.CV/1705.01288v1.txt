Let \mathcal{A} be the family of functions f(z)=z+a_2z^2+... which are analytic in the open unit disc \mathbb{D}=\{z: |z|<1 \}, and denote by \pe of functions p(z)=z+p_1z+p_2z^2+... analytic in \de such that p(z) is in \pe if and only if   p(z)\prec \frac{1+z}{1-z} \Leftrightarrow p(z)=\frac{1+\phi(z)}{1-\phi(z)},  for some Schwarz function \phi(z) and every z\in\de.   Let f(z) be an element of \mathcal{A}, and satisfies the condition z\frac{f'(z)}{f(z)}=\left(\frac{k}{4}+\frac{1}{2}\right)p_{1}(z)-\left(\frac{k}{4}-\frac{1}{2}\right)p_{2}(z) where p_1(z), p_2(z)\in \pe and k\geq 2, then f(z) is called function with bounded radius rotation. The class of such functions is denoted by R_k. This class is generalization of starlike functions.   The main purpose is to give some properties of the class R_k.
