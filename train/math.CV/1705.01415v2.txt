In this paper we deal with the following question: is it true that any bounded smooth pseudoconvex domain in \mathbb{C}^n whose boundary contains a q-dimensional complex manifold M necessarily has a noncompact \overline\partial-Neumann operator N_q (1\leq q\leq n-1)?   We prove that a smooth bounded pseudoconvex domain \Omega\subseteq\mathbb{C}^3 with a one-dimensional complex manifold M in its boundary has a noncompact Neumann operator on (0,1)-forms, under the additional assumption that b\Omega has finite regular D'Angelo 2-type at a point of M, improving previous results of Fu, \c{S}ahuto\u{g}lu, and Straube.
