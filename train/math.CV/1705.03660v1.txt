We consider the class \Sigma(p) of univalent meromorphic functions f on \ID having simple pole at z=p\in[0,1) with residue 1. Let \Sigma_k(p) be the class of functions in \Sigma(p) which have k-quasiconformal extension to the extended complex plane \sphere %with q=\frac{1+k}{1-k} where 0\leq k < 1. We first give a representation formula for functions in this class and using this formula we derive an asymptotic estimate of the Laurent coefficients for the functions in the class \Sigma_k(p). Thereafter we give a sufficient condition for functions in \Sigma(p) to belong in the class \Sigma_k(p). Finally we obtain a sharp distortion result for functions in \Sigma(p) and as a consequence, we get a distortion estimate for functions in \Sigma_k(p).
