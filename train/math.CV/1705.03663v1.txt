Let \mathcal{A}(p) be the class consisting of functions f that are holomorphic in \ID\setminus \{p\}, p\in (0,1) possessing a simple pole at the point z=p with nonzero residue and normalized by the condition f(0)=0=f'(0)-1. In this article, we first prove a sufficient condition for univalency for functions in \mathcal{A}(p). Thereafter, we consider the class denoted by \Sigma(p) that consists of functions f \in \mathcal{A}(p) that are univalent in \ID. We obtain the exact value for \ds\max_ {f\in \Sigma(p)}\Delta(r,z/f), where the Dirichlet integral \Delta(r,z/f) is given by  \Delta(r,z/f)=\ds\iint_{|z|<r} |\left(z/f(z)\right)'|^2 \,dx\, dy, \quad(z=x+iy),~0<r\leq 1.  We also obtain a sharp estimate for \Delta(r,z/f) whenever f belongs to certain subclasses of \Sigma(p). Furthermore, we obtain sharp estimates of the integral means for the aforementioned classes of functions.
