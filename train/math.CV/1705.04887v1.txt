We consider the reproducing kernel function of the theta Bargmann-Fock Hilbert space associated to given full-rank lattice and pseudo-character, and we deal with some of its analytical and arithmetical properties. Specially, the distribution and discreteness of its zeros are examined and analytic sets inside a product of fundamental cells is characterized and shown to be finite and of cardinal less or equal to the dimension of the theta Bargmann-Fock Hilbert space. Moreover, we obtain some remarkable lattice sums by evaluating the so-called complex Hermite-Taylor coefficients. Some of them generalize some of the arithmetic identities established by Perelomov in the framework of coherent states for the specific case of von Neumann lattice. Such complex Hermite-Taylor coefficients are nontrivial examples of the so-called lattice's functions according the Serre terminology. The perfect use of the basic properties of the complex Hermite polynomials is crucial in this framework.
