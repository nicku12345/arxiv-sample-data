We consider the magnetic Laplacian \Delta_{\nu,\mu} on \mathbb{R}^{2n}=\mathbb{C}^n given by  \Delta_{\nu,\mu}= 4\sum\limits_{j=1}\limits^{n}\frac{\partial^2 }{\partial z_j \partial \overline{z_j}} +2i\nu (E+ \overline{E} +n) +2\mu (E- \overline{E} ) -(\nu^2+\mu^2)|z|^2.  We show that \Delta_{\nu,\mu} is connected to the sub-Laplacian of a group of Heisenberg type given by \mathbb{C}\times_\omega \mathbb{C}^n realized as a central extension of the real Heisenberg group H_{2n+1}. We also discuss invariance properties of \Delta_{\nu,\mu} and give some of their explicit spectral properties.
