We study locally univalent functions f analytic in the unit disc \mathbb{D} of the complex plane such that |{f"(z)/f'(z)}|(1-|z|^2)\leq 1+C(1-|z|) holds for all z\in\mathbb{D}, for some 0<C<\infty. If C\leq 1, then f is univalent by Becker's univalence criterion. We discover that for 1<C<\infty the function f remains to be univalent in certain horodiscs. Sufficient conditions which imply that f is bounded, belongs to the Bloch space or belongs to the class of normal functions, are discussed. Moreover, we consider generalizations for locally univalent harmonic functions.
