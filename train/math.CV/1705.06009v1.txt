In this article we consider the class \mathcal{A}(p) which consists of functions that are meromorphic in the unit disc \ID having a simple pole at z=p\in (0,1) with the normalization f(0)=0=f'(0)-1 . First we prove some sufficient conditions for univalence of such functions in \ID. One of these conditions enable us to consider the class \mathcal{V}_{p}(\lambda) that consists of functions satisfying certain differential inequality which forces univalence of such functions. Next we establish that \mathcal{U}_{p}(\lambda)\subsetneq \mathcal{V}_{p}(\lambda), where \mathcal{U}_{p}(\lambda) was introduced and studied in \cite{BF-1}. Finally, we discuss some coefficient problems for \mathcal{V}_{p}(\lambda) and end the article with a coefficient conjecture.
