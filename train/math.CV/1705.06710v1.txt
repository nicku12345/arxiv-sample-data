We discuss approximation of extremal functions by polynomials in the weighted Bergman spaces A^p_\alpha where -1 < \alpha < 0 and -1 < \alpha < p-2. We obtain bounds on how close the approximation is to the true extremal function in the A^p_\alpha and uniform norms. We also discuss several results on the relation between the Bergman modulus of continuity of a function and how quickly its best polynomial approximants converge to it.
