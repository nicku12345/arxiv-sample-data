In this paper, for every q\in(0,1), we obtain the Herglotz representation theorem and discuss the Bieberbach type problem for the class of q-convex functions of order \alpha, 0\le\alpha<1. In addition, we discuss the Fekete-szeg\"o problem and the Hankel determinant problem for the class of q-starlike functions, leading to couple of conjectures for the class of q-starlike functions of order \alpha, 0\le\alpha<1.
