Let X be the dual space of a Luecking-type subspace of the Bergman space A^1. It is known that the Bloch space \mathcal{B} is a subset of X. In 1990, Ghatage and Sun asked whether \mathcal{B} is dense in X. They also asked whether the little version of X is a subset of \mathcal{B}. In this note, based on results and methods of Girela, Pel\'aez, P\'erez-Gonz\'alez and R\"atty\"a in 2008, we answer the two questions in the negative.
