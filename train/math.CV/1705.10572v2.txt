Consider a domain \varOmega in \mathbb{C}^n with n\geqslant 2 and a compact subset K\subset\varOmega such that \varOmega\backslash K is connected. We address the problem whether a holomorphic line bundle defined on \varOmega\backslash K extends to \varOmega. In 2013, Forn\ae ss, Sibony and Wold gave a positive answer in dimension n\geqslant 3, when \varOmega is pseudoconvex and K is a sublevel set of a strongly plurisubharmonic exhaustion function. However, for K of general shape, we construct counterexamples in any dimension n\geqslant 2. The key is a certain gluing lemma by means of which we extend any two holomorphic line bundles which are isomorphic on the intersection of their base spaces.
