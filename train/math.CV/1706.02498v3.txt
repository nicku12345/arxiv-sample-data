We show that fine domains in \mathbf{C} with the property that they are Euclidean F_\sigma and G_\delta, are in fact fine domains of existence for finely holomorphic functions. Moreover \emph{regular} fine domains are also fine domains of existence. Next we show that fine domains such as \mathbf{C}\setminus \mathbf{Q} or \mathbf{C}\setminus (\mathbf{Q}\times i\mathbf{Q}), more specifically fine domains V with the properties that their complement contains a non-empty polar set E that is of the first Baire category in its Euclidean closure K and that (K\setminus E)\subset V, are NOT fine domains of existence.
