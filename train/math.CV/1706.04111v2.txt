The infinitesimal space of a quasiregular mapping was introduced by Gutlyanskii et al and generalized the idea of a derivative for this class of mappings which is only differentiable almost everywhere. In this paper, we show that the infinitesimal space is either simple, that is, it consists of only one mapping, or it contains uncountable many. To achieve this, we define the orbit of a given point as its image under all elements of the infinitesimal space. We prove that this orbit is a compact and connected subset of \mathbb{R}^n \setminus \{ 0 \} and moreover, every such set in dimension two can be realized as an orbit space. We conclude with some examples exhibiting features of orbits.
