Suppose \varphi is a holomorphic self map of the unit disk and C_\varphi is a composition operator with symbol \varphi that fixes the origin and 0<|\varphi'(0)|<1. This work explores sufficient conditions that ensure all holomorphic solutions of Schr\"oder equation for the composition operator C_\varphi belong to a Bloch-type space \mathcal{B}_\alpha for some \alpha>0. The results from composition operators have been extended to weighted composition operators in the second part of this work.
