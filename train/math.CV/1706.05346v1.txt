We consider compact CR manifolds of arbitrary CR codimension that satisfy certain geometric conditions in terms of their Levi form. Over these compact CR manifolds, we construct a deformation of the trivial CR line bundle over M which is topologically trivial over M but fails to be even locally CR trivializable over any open subset of M. In particular, our results apply to compact Lorentzian CR manifolds of hypersurface type.
