The Gauss--Lucas theorem states that any convex set K\subset\mathbb{C} which contains all n zeros of a degree n polynomial p\in\mathbb{C}[z] must also contain all n-1 critical points of p. In this paper we explore the following question: for which choices of positive integers n and k, and positive real number \epsilon, will it follow that for every degree n polynomial p with at least k zeros lying in K, p will have at least k-1 critical points lying in the \epsilon-neighborhood of K. We supply an inequality relating n, k, and \epsilon which, when satisfied, guarantees a positive answer to the above question.
