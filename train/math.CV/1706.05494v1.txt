In this paper, a characterization for inner uniformity of bounded domains in Euclidean n-space \mathbb{R}^n, n\ge 2, in terms of the Gromov hyperbolicity is established, as well as the quasisymmetry of the natural mappings between Gromov boundaries and inner metric boundaries of these domains. In particular, our results show that the answer to a related question, raised by Bonk, Heinonen and Koskela in 2001, is affirmative.
