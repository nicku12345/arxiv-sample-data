Let f be a holomorphic curve in \mathbb{P}^n({\mathbb{C}}) and let \mathcal{D}=\{D_1,\ldots,D_q\} be a family of moving hypersurfaces defined by a set of homogeneous polynomials \mathcal{Q}=\{Q_1,\ldots,Q_q\}. For j=1,\ldots,q, denote by Q_j=\sum\limits_{i_0+\cdots+i_n=d_j}a_{j,I}(z)x_0^{i_0}\cdots x_n^{i_n}, where I=(i_0,\ldots,i_n)\in\mathbb{Z}_{\ge 0}^{n+1} and a_{j,I}(z) are entire functions on {\mathbb{C}} without common zeros. Let \mathcal{K}_{\mathcal{Q}} be the smallest subfield of meromorphic function field \mathcal{M} which contains {\mathbb{C}} and all \frac{a_{j,I'}(z)}{a_{j,I''}(z)} with a_{j,I''}(z)\not\equiv 0, 1\le j\le q. In previous known second main theorems for f and \mathcal{D}, f is usually assumed to be algebraically nondegenerate over \mathcal{K}_{\mathcal{Q}}. In this paper, we prove a second main theorem in which f is only assumed to be nonconstant. This result can be regarded as a generalization of Cartan's conjecture for moving hypersurfaces.
