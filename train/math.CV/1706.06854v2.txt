Brannan showed that a normalized univalent polynomial of the form P(z)=z+a_2 z^2+\ldots + a_{n-1}z^{n-1}+\frac{z^n}{n} is starlike if and only if a_2=\ldots=a_{n-1}=0. We give a new and simple proof of his result, showing further that it is also equivalent to the membership of P in the Noshiro-Warschawski class of univalent functions whose derivative has positive real part in the disk. Both proofs are based on the Fej\'er lemma for trigonometric polynomials with positive real part.
