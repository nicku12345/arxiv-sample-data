We study the projective logarithmic potential \mathbb{G}_{\mu} of a Probability measure \mu on the complex projective space \mathbb{P}^{n}. We prove that the Range of the operator \mu\longrightarrow \mathbb{G}_{\mu} is contained in the (local) domain of definition of the complex Monge-Amp\`ere operator acting on the class of quasi-plurisubharmonic functions on \mathbb{P}^n with respect to the Fubini-Study metric. Moreover, when the measure \mu  has no atom, we show that the complex Monge-Amp\`ere measure of its Logarithmic potential is an absolutely continuous measure with respect to the Fubini-Study volume form on \mathbb{P}^{n}
