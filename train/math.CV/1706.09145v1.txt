Two triangle meshes are conformally equivalent if for any pair of incident triangles the absolute values of the corresponding cross-ratios of the four vertices agree. Such a pair can be considered as preimage and image of a discrete conformal map. In this article we study discrete conformal maps which are defined on parts of a triangular lattice T with strictly acute angles. That is, T is an infinite triangulation of the plane with congruent strictly acute triangles. A smooth conformal map f can be approximated on a compact subset by such discrete conformal maps f^\varepsilon, defined on a part of \varepsilon T for \varepsilon>0 small enough, see [U. B\"ucking, Approximation of conformal mappings using conformally equivalent triangular lattices, in "Advances in Discrete Differential Geometry" (A.I. Bobenko ed.), Springer (2016), 133--149]. We improve this result and show that the convergence is in fact in C^\infty. Furthermore, we describe how the cross-ratios of the four vertices for pairs of incident triangles are related to the Schwarzian derivative of f.
