We define a kind of moduli space of nested surfaces and mappings, which we call a comparison moduli space. We review examples of such spaces in geometric function theory and modern Teichmueller theory, and illustrate how a wide range of phenomena in complex analysis are captured by this notion of moduli space. The paper includes a list of open problems in classical and modern function theory and Teichmueller theory ranging from general theoretical questions to specific technical problems.
