In this paper, we consider the class of uniformly locally univalent harmonic mappings in the unit disk and build a relationship between its pre-Schwarzian norm and uniformly hyperbolic radius. Also, we establish eight ways of characterizing uniformly locally univalent sense-preserving harmonic mappings. We also present some sharp distortions and growth estimates and investigate their connections with Hardy spaces. Finally, we study subordination principles of norm estimates.
