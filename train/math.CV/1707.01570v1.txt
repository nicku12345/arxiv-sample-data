The aim of this paper is twofold. One is to introduce the class of harmonic \nu-Bloch-type mappings as a generalization of harmonic \nu-Bloch mappings and thereby we generalize some recent results of harmonic 1-Bloch-type mappings investigated recently by Efraimidis et al. \cite{EGHV}. The other is to investigate some subordination principles for harmonic Bloch mappings and then establish Bohr's theorem for these mappings and in a general setting, in some cases.
