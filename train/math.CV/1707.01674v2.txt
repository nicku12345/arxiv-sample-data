We introduce new classes of right quaternionic Hilbert spaces of Bargmann-Fock type \mathcal{GB}_{m}^{2}(\mathbb{H}), labeled by nonnegative integer m, generalizing the so-called slice hyperholomorphic Bargmann-Fock space introduced recently by Alpay, Colombo, Sabadini and Salomon (2014). They are realized as L^2-eigenspaces of a sliced second order differential operator. The concrete description of these spaces is investigated and involves the so-called quaternionic Hermite polynomials. Their basic properties are discussed and the explicit formulae of their reproducing kernels are given. Associated Segal-Bargmann transforms, generalizing the one considered quite recently by Diki and Ghanmi (2017), are also introduced and studied. Connection to the quaternionic Fourier-Wigner transform is established.
