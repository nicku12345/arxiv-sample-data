We consider convergence sets of formal power series of the form f(z,t)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} f_n(z)t^n, where f_n(z) are holomorphic functions on a domain \Omega in \mathbb{C}. A subset E of \Omega is said to be a convergence set in \Omega if there is a series f(z,t) such that E is exactly the set of points z for which f(z,t) converges as a power series in a single variable t in some neighborhood of the origin. A \sigma-convex set is defined to be the union of a countable collection of polynomially convex compact subsets. We prove that a subset of \mathbb{C} is a convergence set if and only if it is \sigma-convex.
