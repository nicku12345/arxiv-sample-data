We study the problem of extension of normal jets from a hypersurface, with focus on the growth order of the constant. Using aspects of the standard, twisted approach for L^2 extension and of the new approach to L^2 extension introduced by Berndtsson and Lempert, we are able to obtain an extension theorem with a constant C^k where C is universal and k is the jet order. We then use the jet extension theorem to extend positively curved singular Hermitian metrics from smooth, deformably pseudoeffective hypersurfaces in projective manifolds.
