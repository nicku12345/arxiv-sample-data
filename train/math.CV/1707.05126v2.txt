The object of the present paper is to introduce and investigate two new general subclasses {{S}^{*}}C(\alpha ,\beta ;\gamma ) and T{{S}^{*}}C(\alpha ,\beta ;\gamma )~~(\alpha, \beta \in [0,1),~\gamma \in [0,1]) of the analytic functions. Here, we give sufficient conditions as well as necessary and sufficient conditions for the functions belonging to the classes.
