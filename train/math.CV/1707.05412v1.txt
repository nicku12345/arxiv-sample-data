In this paper, we study linear transformations of the form T[x^n]=P_n(x) where \{P_n(x)\} is an orthogonal polynomial system. Of particular interest is understanding when these operators preserve real-rootedness in polynomials. It is known that when the P_n(x) are the Hermite polynomials or standard Laguerre polynomials, the transformation T has this property. It is also known that the transformation T[x^n]=H_n^{\alpha}(x), where H_n^{\alpha}(x) is the nth generalized Hermite Polynomial with real parameter \alpha, has the differential operator representation T[x^n]=e^{-\frac{\alpha}{2}D^2}x^n. The main result of this paper is to prove that a differential operator of the form \sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{\gamma_k}{k!} D^k induces a system of monic orthogonal polynomials if and only if \sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{\gamma_k}{k!} D^k=\gamma_0e^{-\frac{ \alpha}{2}D^2-\beta D} where \gamma_0,\alpha,\beta \in \mathbb{C} and \alpha,\gamma_0 \neq 0. This operator will produce a shifted set of generalized Hermite polynomials when \alpha \in \mathbb{R}. We also express the transformation from the standard basis to the standard Laguerre basis, T[x^n]=L_n(x) as a differential operator of the form \sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{p_k(x)}{k!} D^k where the p_k are polynomials, an identity that has not previously been shown.
