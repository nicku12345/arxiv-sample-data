The length of the shortest closed geodesic in a hyperbolic surface X is called the systole of X. When X is an n-times punctured sphere \hat{ \mathbb{C}} \setminus A where A \subset \hat{\mathbb{C}} is a finite set of cardinality n\ge4, we define a quantity Q(A) in terms of cross ratios of quadruples in A so that Q(A) is quantitatively comparable with the systole of X. We next propose a method to construct a distance function d_X on a punctured sphere X which is Lipschitz equivalent to the hyperbolic distance h_X on X. In particular, when the construction is based on a modified quasihyperbolic metric, d_X is Lipschitz equivalent to h_X with Lipschitz constant depending only on Q(A).
