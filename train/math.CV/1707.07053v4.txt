Following Semmes and Zinsmeister, we continue the study of Carleson measures and their invariance under pull-back and push-forward operators. We also study the analogous statements for vanishing Carleson measures. As an application, we show that some quotient space of the space of chord-arc curves has a natural complex structure.
