In this article, we derive an inequality of {\L}ojasiewicz-Siciak type for certain sets arising in the context of the complex dynamics in dimension 1. More precisely, if we denote by dist the euclidian distance in \mathbb{C}, we show that the Green function G_K of the filled Julia set K of a polynomial such that \mathring{K}\neq \emptyset satisfies the so-called {\L}S condition \displaystyle G_A\geq c\cdot dist(\cdot, K)^{c'} in a neighborhood of K, for some constants c,c'>0. Relatively few examples of compact sets satisfying the {\L}S condition are known. Our result highlights an interesting class of compact sets fulfilling this condition. The fact that filled Julia sets satisfy the {\L}S condition may seem surprising, since they are in general very irregular. In order to prove our main result, we define and study the set of obstruction points to the {\L}S condition. We also prove, in dimension n\geq 1, that for a polynomially convex and L-regular compact set of non empty interior, these obstruction points are rare, in a sense which will be specified.
