In this paper we consider the \bar\partial-problem in fiber bundles (fibers biholomorphic to \mathbb C^k, k\geq 1), namely the equation \bar\partial\sigma =\omega for (0,1)-forms \omega which decrease along the fibers. The order of decrease is slightly more than one. The important fact is that we do not assume that \omega has compact support. The main theorem says that the equation has a solution which also decreases along fibers, however, not necessarily with the order as the original form. Existence of solution of the above mentioned \bar\partial-problem can be applied in various situations in Complex Analysis, in particular, to the Hartogs extension phenomenon.
