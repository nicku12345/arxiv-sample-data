We shall explain here an idea to generalize classical complex analytic Kleinian group theory to any odd dimensional cases. For a certain class of discrete subgroups of \PGL_{2n+1}(\C) acting on \P^{2n+1}, we can define their domains of discontinuity in a canonical manner, regarding an n-dimensional projective linear subspace in \P^{2n+1} as a point, like a point in the classical 1-dimensional case. Many interesting (compact) non-K\"ahler manifolds appear systematically as the canonical quotients of the domains. In the last section, we shall give some examples.
