The Toeplitz operator acting on the Bergman space A^{2}(\mathbb{D}), with symbol \varphi is given by T_{\varphi}f=P(\varphi f), where P is the projection from L^{2}(\mathbb{D}) onto the Bergman space. We present some history on the study of hyponormal Toeplitz operators acting on A^{2}(\mathbb{D}), as well as give results for when \varphi is a non-harmonic polynomial. We include a first investigation of Putnam's inequality for hyponormal operators with non-analytic symbols. Particular attention is given to unusual hyponormality behavior that arises due to the extension of the class of allowed symbols.
