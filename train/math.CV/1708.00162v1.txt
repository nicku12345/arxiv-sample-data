In this paper, using positivity of trigonometric cosine and sine sums whose coefficients are generalization of Vietoris numbers, we find the conditions on the coefficient \{a_k\} to characterize the geometric properties of the corresponding analytic function f(z)=z+\displaystyle\sum_{k=2}^{\infty} a_kz^k in the unit disc \mathbb{D}. As an application we also find geometric properties of a generalized Ces\`aro type polynomials.
