The object of the present paper is to study certain properties and characteristics of the operator Q_{p,\beta}^{\alpha}defined on p-valent analytic function by using technique of differential subordination.We also obtained result involving majorization problems by applying the operator to p-valent analytic function.Relevant connection of the the result are presented here with those obtained by earlier worker are pointed out.
