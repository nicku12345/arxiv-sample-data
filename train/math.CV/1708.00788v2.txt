We present a set of necessary and sufficient conditions that provides a Schwarz lemma for the tetrablock \mathbb E. As an application of this result, we obtain a Schwarz lemma for the symmetrized bidisc \mathbb G_2. In either case, our results generalize all previous results in this direction for \mathbb E and \mathbb G_2.
