This work consists of two parts. In the first part, we consider a compact connected strongly pseudoconvex CR manifold X with a transversal CR S^{1} action. We establish an equidistribution theorem on zeros of CR functions. The main techniques involve a uniform estimate of Szeg\H{o} kernel on X. In the second part, we consider a general complex manifold M with a strongly pseudoconvex boundary X. By using classical result of Boutet de Monvel-Sj\"ostrand about Bergman kernel asymptotics, we establish an equidistribution theorem on zeros of holomorphic functions on \overline M.
