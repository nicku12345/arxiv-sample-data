Let \Gamma be a Lipschitz curve on the complex plane \mathbb{C} and \Omega_+ is the domain above \Gamma, we define Hardy space H^p(\Omega_+) as the set of holomorphic functions F satisfying \sup_{\tau>0}(\int_{\Gamma} |F(\zeta+\mathrm{i}\tau)|^p |\,\mathrm{d}\zeta|)^{\frac1p}< \infty. We mainly focus on the case of 1<p<\infty in this paper, and prove that if F(w)\in H^p(\Omega_+), then F(w) has non-tangential boundary limit F(\zeta) a.e. on \Gamma, and F(w) is the Cauchy integral of F(\zeta). We denote the conformal mapping from \mathbb{C}_+ onto \Omega_+ as \Phi, and then prove that,  H^p(\Omega_+) is isomorphic to H^p(\mathbb{C}_+), the classical Hardy space on upper half plane, under the mapping T\colon F\to F(\Phi(z))\cdot (\Phi'(z))^\frac{1}{p}, where F\in H^p(\Omega_+).
