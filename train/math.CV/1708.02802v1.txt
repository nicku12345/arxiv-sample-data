For discrete subsets in {\bf C}^n the notion of being "tame" was defined by Rosay and Rudin. We propose a general definition of "tameness" for arbitrary complex manifolds and show that many results classically known for {\bf C}^n may be generalized to semisimple complex Lie groups. For example, every permutation of SL(2,{\bf Z}) extends to a biholomorphic self-map of SL(2,{\bf C}.
