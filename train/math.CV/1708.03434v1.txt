Graham Theorem on the unit ball B_{n} in \mathbb{C}^{n} states that every invariant harmonic function u\in C^{n}(\overline{B}_{n}) must be pluriharmonic in B_{n}. This rigidity phenomenon of Graham have been studied by many authors. In this paper, we prove that Graham theorem holds on classical bounded symmetric domains. Which include Type I domains, Type II domains, Type III domains III(n) with even n and some special Type IV domains.
