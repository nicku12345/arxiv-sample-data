Let f=h+\overline{g} be a normalized harmonic mapping in the unit disk \ID. In this paper, we obtain the sharp radius of univalence, fully starlikeness and fully convexity of the harmonic linear differential operators D_f^{\epsilon}=zf_{z}-\epsilon\overline{z}f_{\overline{z}}~(|\epsilon|=1) and F_{\lambda}(z)=(1-\lambda)f+\lambda D_f^{\epsilon}~(0\leq\lambda\leq 1) when the coefficients of h and g satisfy harmonic Bieberbach coefficients conjecture conditions. Similar problems are also solved when the coefficients of h and g satisfy the corresponding necessary conditions of the harmonic convex function f=h+\overline{g}. All results are sharp. Some of the results are motivated by the work of Kalaj et al. \cite{Kalaj2014} (Complex Var. Elliptic Equ. 59(4) (2014), 539--552).
