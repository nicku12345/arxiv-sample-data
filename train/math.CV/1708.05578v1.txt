We determine the Bohr radius for the class of all functions f of the form f(z)=\sum_{k=1}^\infty a_{kp+m} z^{kp+m} analytic in the unit disk |z|<1 and satisfy the condition |f(z)|\le 1 for all |z|<1. In particular, our result also contains a solution to a recent conjecture of Ali, Barnard and Solynin \cite{AliBarSoly} for the Bohr radius for odd analytic functions, solved by the authors in \cite{KayPon1}. We consider a more flexible approach by introducing the p-Bohr radius for harmonic functions which in turn contains the classical Bohr radius as special case. Also, we prove several other new results and discuss p-Bohr radius for the class of odd harmonic bounded functions.
