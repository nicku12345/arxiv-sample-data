Cone spherical metrics are conformal metrics with constant curvature one and finitely many conical singularities on compact Riemann surfaces. By using Strebel differentials as a bridge, we construct a new class of cone spherical metrics on compact Riemann surfaces by drawing on the surfaces some class of connected metric ribbon graphs.
