The theory of q-analogs frequently occurs in a number of areas, including the fractals and dynamical systems. The q-derivatives and q-integrals play a prominent role in the study of q-deformed quantum mechanical simple harmonic oscillator. In this paper, we define a symmetric q-derivative operator and study new family of univalent functions defined by use of that operator. We establish some new relations between functions satisfying analytic conditions related to conical sections.
