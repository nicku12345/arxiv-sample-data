Let 0<p<\infty, \Gamma be a Lipschitz curve on the complex plane~\mathbb{C} and \Omega_+ is the domain above \Gamma, we define Hardy space H^p(\Omega_+) as the set of analytic functions F satisfying \sup_{\tau>0}(\int_{\Gamma} |F(\zeta+\mathrm{i}\tau)|^p |\,\mathrm{d}\zeta|)^{\frac1p}< \infty. We denote the conformal mapping from \mathbb{C}_+ onto \Omega_+ as \Phi, and prove that, H^p(\Omega_+) is isomorphic to H^p(\mathbb{C}_+), the classical Hardy space on the upper half plane~\mathbb{C}_+, under the mapping T\colon F\to F(\Phi)\cdot (\Phi')^{\frac1p}. Besides, T and T^{-1} are both bounded. We also prove that if F(w)\in H^p(\Omega_+), then F(w) has non-tangential boundary limit F(\zeta) a.e. on \Gamma, and, if 1\leqslant p< \infty, F(w) is the Cauchy integral on \Gamma of F(\zeta).
