In the article we consider the composite conformal map which maps annulus to infinite region with symmetric hole and nearly circular hole. It is shown that such transformation is good if the distance between centers of holes are large or radius of circular hole is small. Examples for bilinear-hypotrochoids mapping and bilinear-Schwarz-Christoffel mapping are present.
