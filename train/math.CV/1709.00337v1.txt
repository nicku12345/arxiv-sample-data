In the present article, we define a new subclass of pseudo-type meromorphic bi-univalent functions class \Sigma' of complex order \gamma \in \mathbb{C}\backslash \{0\} and investigate the initial coefficient estimates |b_0|, |b_1| and |b_2|. Further we mention several new or known consequences of our result.
