We consider the family of all meromorphic functions f of the form  f(z)=\frac{1}{z}+b_0+b_1z+b_2z^2+\cdots  analytic and locally univalent in the puncture disk \mathbb{D}_0:=\{z\in\mathbb{C}:\,0<|z|<1\}. Our first objective in this paper is to find a sufficient condition for f to be meromorphically convex of order \alpha, 0\le \alpha<1, in terms of the fact that the absolute value of the well-known Schwarzian derivative S_f (z) of f is bounded above by a smallest positive root of a non-linear equation. Secondly, we consider a family of functions g of the form g(z)=z+a_2z^2+a_3z^3+\cdots analytic and locally univalent in the open unit disk \mathbb{D}:=\{z\in\mathbb{C}:\,|z|<1\}, and show that g is belonging to a family of functions convex in one direction if |S_g(z)| is bounded above by a small positive constant depending on the second coefficient a_2. In particular, we show that such functions g are also contained in the starlike and close-to-convex family.
