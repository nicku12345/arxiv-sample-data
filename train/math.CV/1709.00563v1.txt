We provide the details of the first proof in~\cite{CJS89}, which proved that Cauchy transform of L^2~functions on Lipschitz curves is bounded. We then prove that every L^2~function on Lipschitz curves is the sum of non-tangential boundary limit of functions in H^2(\Omega_\pm), the Hardy spaces on domains over and under the Lipschitz curve. We also obtain a more accurate boundary of Cauchy transform under the condition that the Lipschitz curve is the real axis.
