Let \Omega\subset\mathbb{C}^n, n\geq 2, be a domain with smooth connected boundary. If \Omega is relatively compact, the Hartogs-Bochner theorem ensures that every CR distribution on \partial\Omega has a holomorphic extension to \Omega. For unbounded domains this extension property may fail, for example if \Omega contains a complex hypersurface. The main result in this paper tells that the extension property holds if and only if the envelope of holomorphy of \mathbb{C}^n\backslash\overline{\Omega} is \mathbb{C}^n. It seems that it is a first result in the literature which gives a geometric characterization of unbounded domains in \mathbb C^n for which the Hartogs phenomenon holds. Comparing this to earlier work by the first two authors and Z.~S{\l}odkowski, one observes that the extension problem sensitively depends on a finer geometry of the contact of a complex hypersurface and the boundary of the domain.
