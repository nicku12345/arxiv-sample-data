Let X be a compact subset of the complex plane. It is shown that if a point x_0 admits a bounded point derivation on R^p(X), the closure of rational function with poles off X in the L^p(dA) norm, for p >2 and if X contains an interior cone, then the bounded point derivation can be represented by the difference quotient if the limit is taken over a non-tangential ray to x_0. A similar result is proven for higher order bounded point derivations. These results extend a theorem of O'Farrell for R(X), the closure of rational functions with poles off X in the uniform norm.
