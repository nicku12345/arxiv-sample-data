We consider the class of all sense-preserving harmonic mappings f= h+\overline{g} of the unit disk \ID, where h and g are analytic with g(0)=0, and determine the Bohr radius if any one of the following conditions holds: \bee h is bounded in \ID. h satisfies the condition {\rm Re}\, h(z)\leq 1 in \mathbb{D} with h(0)>0. both h and g are bounded in \ID. h is bounded and g'(0)=0. \eee We also consider the problem of determining the Bohr radius when the supremum of the modulus of the dilatation of f in \ID is strictly less than 1. In addition, we determine the Bohr radius for the space \mathcal B of analytic Bloch functions and the space {\mathcal B}_H of harmonic Bloch functions. The paper concludes with two conjectures.
