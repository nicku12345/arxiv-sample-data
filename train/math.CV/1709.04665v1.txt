We define Hardy spaces H^p(\Omega_\pm) on half-strip domain~\Omega_+ and \Omega_-= \mathbb{C}\setminus\overline{\Omega_+}, where 0<p<\infty, and prove that functions in H^p(\Omega_\pm) has non-tangential boundary limit a.e. on \Gamma, the common boundary of \Omega_\pm. We then prove that Cauchy integral of functions in L^p(\Gamma) are in H^p(\Omega_\pm), where 1<p<\infty, that is, Cauchy transform is bounded. Besides, if 1\leqslant p<\infty, then H^p(\Omega_\pm) functions are the Cauchy integral of their non-tangential boundary limits. We also establish an isomorphism between H^p(\Omega_\pm) and H^p(\mathbb{C}_\pm), the classical Hardy spaces over upper and lower half complex planes.
