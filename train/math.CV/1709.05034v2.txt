Let L_0 and L_1 be two distinct rays emanating from the origin and let {\mathcal F} be the family of all functions holomorphic in the unit disk {\mathbb D} for which all zeros lie on L_0 while all 1-points lie on L_1. It is shown that {\mathcal F} is normal in {\mathbb D}\backslash\{0\}. The case where L_0 is the positive real axis and L_1 is the negative real axis is studied in more detail.
