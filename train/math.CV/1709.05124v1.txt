In the paper the complex geodesics of a convex domain in \mathbb C^n are studied. One of the main results of the paper provides certain necessary condition for a holomorphic map to be a complex geodesic for a convex domain in \mathbb C^n. The established condition is of geometric nature and it allows to find a formula for every complex geodesic. The \mathbb C-convexity of semitube domains is also discussed.
