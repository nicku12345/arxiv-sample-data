The edge-of-the-wedge theorem in several complex variables gives the analytic continuation of functions defined on the poly upper half plane and the poly lower half plane, the set of points in \mathbb{C}^d with all coordinates in the upper and lower half planes respectively, through a set in real space, \mathbb{R}^d. The geometry of the set in the real space can force the function to analytically continue within the boundary itself, which is qualified in our wedge-of-the-edge theorem. For example, if a function extends to the union of two cubes in \mathbb{R}^d which are positively oriented, with some small overlap, the functions must analytically continue to a neighborhood of that overlap of a fixed size not depending of the size of the overlap.
