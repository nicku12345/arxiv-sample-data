For 0<\lambda \leq 1, let {\mathcal U}(\lambda) denote the family of functions f(z)=z+\sum_{n=2}^{\infty}a_nz^n analytic in the unit disk \ID satisfying the condition \left |\left (\frac{z}{f(z)}\right )^{2}f'(z)-1\right |<\lambda  in \ID. Although functions in this family are known to be univalent in \ID, the coefficient conjecture about a_n for n\geq 5 remains an open problem. In this article, we shall first present a non-sharp bound for |a_n|. Some members of the family {\mathcal U}(\lambda) are given by  \frac{z}{f(z)}=1-(1+\lambda)\phi(z) + \lambda (\phi(z))^2  with \phi(z)=e^{i\theta}z, that solve many extremal problems in {\mathcal U}(\lambda). Secondly, we shall consider the following question: Do there exist functions \phi analytic in \ID with |\phi (z)|<1 that are not of the form \phi(z)=e^{i\theta}z for which the corresponding functions f of the above form are members of the family {\mathcal U}(\lambda)? Finally, we shall solve the second coefficient (a_2) problem in an explicit form for f\in {\mathcal U}(\lambda) of the form f(z) =\frac{z}{1-a_2z+\lambda z\int_0^z\omega(t)\,dt},  where \omega is analytic in \ID such that |\omega(z)|\leq 1 and \omega(0)=a, where a\in \overline{\ID}.
