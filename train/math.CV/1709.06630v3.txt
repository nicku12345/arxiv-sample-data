We revisit the approximation of nonempty compact planar sets by filled-in Julia sets of polynomials developed by Lindsey and Younsi and analyze the rate of approximation. We use slightly modified fundamental Lagrange interpolation polynomials and show that taking certain classes of nodes with subexponential growth of Lebesgue constants improves the approximation rate. To this end we investigate properties of some arrays of points in \mathbb{C}. In particular we prove subexponential growth of Lebesgue constants for pseudo Leja sequences with bounded Edrei growth on finite unions of quasiconformal arcs. Finally, for some classes of sets we estimate more precisely the rate of approximation by filled-in Julia sets in Hausdorff and Klimek metrics.
