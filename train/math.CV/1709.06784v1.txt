Using the theory of functions of several variables and q-calculus, we prove an expansion theorem for the analytic function in several variables which satisfies a system of q-partial differential equations. Some curious applications of this expansion theorem to q-series are discussed. In particular, an extension of Andrews' transformation formula for the q-Lauricella function is given.
