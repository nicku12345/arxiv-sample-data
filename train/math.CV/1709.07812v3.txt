In this paper we present some linear algebra behind quadratic parts of quadratically flat complex points of codimension two real submanifold in a complex manifold. Assuming some extra nondegenericity and using the result of Hong, complete normal form descriptions can be given, and in low dimensions, we obtain a complete classification without any extra assumptions.
