In the authors' first paper, Beurling-Rudin-Korenbljum type characterization of the closed ideals in a certain algebra of holomorphic functions was used to describe the lattice of invariant subspaces of the shift plus a complex Volterra operator. Current work is an extension of the previous work and it describes the lattice of invariant subspaces of the shift plus a positive integer multiple of the complex Volterra operator on the Hardy space. Our work was motivated by a paper by Ong who studied the real version of the same operator.
