We prove several improved versions of Bohr's inequality for the harmonic mappings of the form f=h+\overline{g}, where h is bounded by 1 and |g'(z)|\le|h'(z)|. The improvements are obtained along the lines of an earlier work of Kayumov and Ponnusamy, i.e. \cite{KayPon2}, for example a term related to the area of the image of the disk D(0,r) under the mapping f is considered. Our results are sharp. In addition, further improvements of the main results for certain special classes of harmonic mappings are provided.
