We present a form of Schwarz's lemma for holomorphic maps between convex domains D_1 and D_2. This result provides a lower bound on the distance between the images of relatively compact subsets of D_1 and the boundary of D_2. This is a natural improvement of an old estimate by Bernal-Gonz\'alez that takes into account the geometry of \partial{D_1}. Using similar techniques, we also provide a new estimate for the Kobayashi metric on bounded convex domains.
