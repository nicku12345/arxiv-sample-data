We give several versions of Siu's \partial\bar{\partial}-formula for maps from a strictly pseudoconvex pseudo-Hermitian manifold (M^{2m+1}, \theta) into a K\"ahler manifold (N^n, g). We also define and study the notion of pseudo-Hermitian harmonicity for maps from M into N. In particular, we prove a CR version of Siu Rigidity Theorem for pseudo-Hermitian harmonic maps from a pseudo-Hermitian manifold with vanishing Webster torsion into a K\"ahler manifold having strongly negative curvature.
