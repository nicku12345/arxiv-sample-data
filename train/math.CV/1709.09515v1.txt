As a consequence of Koebe's retrosection theorem, every closed Riemann surface of genus g \geq 2 is uniformized by a Schottky group. Marden observed that there are Schottky groups which are not classical ones, that is, they cannot be defined by a suitable collection of circles. This opened the question to if every closed Riemann surface can be uniformized by a classical Schottky group. Recently, Hou has observed this question has an affirmative answer by first noting that every closed Riemann surface can be uniformized by a Schottky group with limit set of Hausdorff dimension <1 and then by proving that such a Schottky group is necessarily a classical one. In this paper, we provide another argument, based on the density of Belyi curves on the the moduli space {\mathcal M}_{g} and the fact that the locus {\mathcal M}_{g}^{cs} \subset {\mathcal M}_{g} of those Riemann surfaces uniformized by classical Schottky groups is a non-empty open set. We show that every Belyi curve can be uniformized by a classical Schottky group, so {\mathcal M}_{g}^{cs}={\mathcal M}_{g}.
