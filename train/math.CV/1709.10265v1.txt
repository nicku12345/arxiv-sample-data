This paper develops further the theory of the automorphic group of non-constant entire functions. This theory essentially started with two remarkable papers of Tatsujir\^o Shimizu that were published in 1931. There are three results in this paper. The first result is that the {\rm Aut}(f)-orbit of any complex number has no finite accumulation point. The second result is an accurate computation of the derivative of an automorphic function of an entire function at any of its fixed points. The third result gives the precise form of an automorphic function that is uniform over an open subset of \mathbb{C}. This last result is a follow up of a remarkable theorem of Shimizu. It is a sharp form of his result. It leads to an algorithm of computing the entire automorphic functions of entire functions. The complexity is computed using an height estimate of a rational parameter discovered by Shimizu.
