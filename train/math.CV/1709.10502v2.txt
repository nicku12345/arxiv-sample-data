Let T be a positive closed current of bidimension (p,p) with unit mass on the complex projective space \mathbb P^n. For certain values of \alpha and \beta = \beta(p, \alpha) we show that if T has enough points where the Lelong number is at least \alpha, then the upper level set E_{\beta}^+ (T) of points where T has Lelong number strictly larger than \beta has certain geometric properties.
