In this paper, we introduce and investigate a new subclass of the function class \Sigma of bi-univalent functions defined in the open unit disk, which are associated with the S\u{a}l\u{a}gean type q- difference operator and satisfy some subordination conditions. Furthermore, we find estimates on the Taylor-Maclaurin coefficients |a_2| and |a_3| for functions in the new subclass introduced here. Several (known or new) consequences of the results are also pointed out. Further we obtain Fekete-Szeg\ddot{o} inequality for the new function class.
