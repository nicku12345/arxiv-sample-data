It is established that if a harmonic function u on the unit disk \mathbb D in \mathbb C has angular limits on a measurable set E of the unit circle \partial\mathbb D, then its conjugate harmonic function v in \mathbb D also has angular limits a.e. on E and both boundary functions are finite a.e. and measurable on E. The result is extended to arbitrary Jordan domains with rectifiable boundaries in terms of angular limits and of the natural parameter.
