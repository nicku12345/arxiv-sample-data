Each extreme edge of the Newton diagram of a plurisubharmonic polynomial on \mathbb{C}^2 gives rise to a plurisubharmonic polynomial. It is tempting to believe that the union of the extreme edges or the convex hull of said union will do the same. We construct a plurisubharmonic polynomial P on \mathbb{C}^2 with precisely two extreme edges E_1 and E_2, such that neither E_1\cup{E_2} nor \text{Conv}({E_1\cup{}E_2}) yields a plurisubharmonic polynomial.
