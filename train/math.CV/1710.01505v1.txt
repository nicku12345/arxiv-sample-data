In this paper, we investigate the delay differential equations of Malmquist type of form \begin{equation*} w(z+1)-w(z-1)+a(z)\frac{w'(z)}{w(z)}=R(z, w(z)),~~~~~~~~~~~~~~(*) \end{equation*} where R(z, w(z)) is an irreducible rational function in w(z) with rational coefficients and a(z) is a rational function. We characterize all reduced forms when the equation (*) admits a transcendental entire solutions with hyper-order less than one. When we compare with the results obtained by Halburd and Korhonen[Proc.Amer.Math.Soc., forcoming],we obtain the reduced forms without the assumptions that the denominator of rational function R(z,w(z)) has roots that are nonzero rational functions in z. The growth order and value distribution of transcendental entire solutions for the reduced forms are also investigated.
