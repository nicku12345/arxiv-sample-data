In this paper, we investigate zeros of difference polynomials of the form f(z)^nH(z, f)-s(z), where f(z) is a meromorphic function, H(z, f) is a difference polynomial of f(z) and s(z) is a small function. We first obtain some inequalities for the relationship of the zero counting function of f(z)^nH(z, f)-s(z) and the characteristic function and pole counting function of f(z). Based on these inequalities, we establish some difference analogues of a classical result of Hayman for meromorphic functions. Some special cases are also investigated. These results improve previous findings.
