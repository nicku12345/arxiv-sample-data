We obtain L^p regularity for the Bergman projection on some Reinhardt domains. We start with a bounded initial domain \Omega with some symmetry properties and generate successor domains in higher {dimensions}. We prove: If the Bergman kernel on \Omega satisfies appropriate estimates, then the Bergman projection on the successor is L^p bounded. For example, the Bergman projection on successors of strictly pseudoconvex initial domains is bounded on L^p for 1<p<\infty. The successor domains need not have smooth boundary nor be strictly pseudoconvex.
