We provide a necessary condition for the existence of a 3-point holomorphic interpolant F:\mathbb{D}\longrightarrow\Omega_n, n\geq 2. Our condition is inequivalent to the necessary conditions hitherto known for this problem. The condition generically involves a single inequality and is reminiscent of the Schwarz lemma. We combine some of the ideas and techniques used in our result on the \mathcal{O}(\mathbb{D},\Omega_n)-interpolation problem to establish a Schwarz lemma -- which may be of independent interest -- for holomorphic correspondences from \mathbb{D} to a general planar domain \Omega\Subset \mathbb{C}.
