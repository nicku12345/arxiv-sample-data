In this paper we study the existence of Lelong numbers of m-subharmonic currents of bidimension (p,p) on an open subset of \Bbb C^n, when m+p\geq n. In the special case of m-subharmonic function \varphi, we give a relationship between the Lelong numbers of dd^c\varphi and the mean values of \varphi on spheres or balls. As an application we study the integrability exponent of \varphi. We express the integrability exponent of \varphi in terms of volume of sub-level sets of \varphi and we give a link between this exponent and its Lelong number.
