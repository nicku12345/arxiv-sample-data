We establish necessary and sufficient conditions for boundedness of composition operators on the most general class of Hilbert spaces of entire Dirichlet series with real frequencies. Depending on whether or not the space contains any nonzero constant function, different criteria for boundedness are developed. Thus, we complete the characterization of bounded composition operators on all known Hilbert spaces of entire Dirichlet series of one variable.
