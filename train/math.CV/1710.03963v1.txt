A holomorphic mapping H between two real-analytic CR manifolds M and M' is said to be locally rigid if any other holomorphic map F\colon M \to M' which is close enough to H is obtained by composing H with suitable automorphisms of M and M'. With the aim of reducing the local rigidity problem to a linear one, we provide sufficient infinitesimal conditions. Furthermore we study some topological properties of the action of the automorphism group on the space of nondegenerate mappings from M to M'.
