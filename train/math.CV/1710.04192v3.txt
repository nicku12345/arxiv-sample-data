We prove that for a strongly pseudoconvex domain D\subset\mathbb C^n, the infinitesimal Carath\'eodory metric g_C(z,v) and the infinitesimal Kobayashi metric g_K(z,v) coincide if z is sufficiently close to bD and if v is sufficiently close to being tangential to bD. Also, we show that every two close points of D sufficiently close to the boundary and whose difference is almost tangential to bD can be joined by a (unique up to reparameterization) complex geodesic of D which is also a holomorphic retract of D.   The same continues to hold if D is a worm domain, as long as the points are sufficiently close to a strongly pseudoconvex boundary point. We also show that a strongly pseudoconvex boundary point of a worm domain can be globally exposed, this has consequences for the behavior of the squeezing function.
