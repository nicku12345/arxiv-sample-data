Quasiconformal maps in the plane are orientation preserving homeomorphisms that satisfy certain distortion inequalities; infinitesimally, they map circles to ellipses of bounded eccentricity. Such maps have many useful geometric distortion properties, and yield a flexible and powerful generalization of conformal mappings. In this work, we study the singularities of these maps, in particular the sizes of the sets where a quasiconformal map can exhibit given stretching and rotation behavior. We improve results by Astala-Iwaniec-Prause-Saksman and Hitruhin to give examples of stretching and rotation sets with non-sigma-finite measure at the appropriate Hausdorff dimension. We also improve this to give examples with positive Riesz capacity at the critical homogeneity, as well as positivity for a broad class of gauged Hausdorff measures at that dimension.
