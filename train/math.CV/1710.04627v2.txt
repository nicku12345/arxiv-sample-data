The moduli space {\mathcal{M}}_{g}, of genus g\geq2 closed Riemann surfaces, is a complex orbifold of dimension 3(g-1) which carries a natural real structure i.e. it admits an anti-holomorphic involution \sigma. The involution \sigma maps each point corresponding to a Riemann surface S to its complex conjugate \overline{S}. The fixed point set of \sigma consists of the isomorphism classes of closed Riemann surfaces admitting an anticonformal automorphism. Inside \mathrm{Fix}(\sigma) is the locus {\mathcal{M}}_{g}(\mathbb{R}), the set of real Riemann surfaces, which is known to be connected by results due to P. Buser, M. Sepp\"{a}l\"{a} and R. Silhol. The complement \mathrm{Fix}(\sigma)-{\mathcal{M}}_{g}(\mathbb{R}) consists of the so called pseudo-real Riemann surfaces, which is known to be non-connected. In this short note we provide a simple argument to observe that \mathrm{Fix}(\sigma) is connected.
