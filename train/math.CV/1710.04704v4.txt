An integral solution operator for \bar\partial is constructed on product domains that include the punctured bidisc. This operator is shown to satisfy L^p estimates for all 1\leq p <\infty, though with non-standard -- relative to strongly pseudoconvex domains -- bounding term. These estimates imply L^p estimates for \bar\partial on the Hartogs triangle, with greater range of p than the canonical solution satisfies.
