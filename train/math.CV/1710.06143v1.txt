A weighted Hilbert space F^2_{\varphi} of entire functions of n variables is considered in the paper. The weight function \varphi is a convex function on {\mathbb C}^n depending on modules of variables and growing at infinity faster than a \Vert z \Vert for each a > 0. The problem of description of the strong dual of this space in terms of the Laplace transformation of functionals is studied in the article. Under some additional conditions on \varphi the space of the Laplace transforms of linear continuous functionals on F^2_{\varphi} is described. The proof of the main result is based on new properties of the Young-Fenchel transformation and a result of R.A. Bashmakov, K.P. Isaev and R.S. Yulmukhametov on asymptotics of multidimensional Laplace transform.
