We consider Riemann surfaces \Sigma with n borders homeomorphic to \mathbb{S}^1 and no handles. Using generalized Grunsky operators, we define a period mapping from the infinite-dimensional Teichm\"uller space of surfaces of this type into the unit ball in the linear space of operators on an n-fold direct sum of Bergman spaces of the disk. We show that this period mapping is holomorphic and injective.
