Take complex numbers a_j,b_j, (j=0,1,2) such that c\neq0 and {\rm rank} ( {ccc} a_{0} & a_{1} & a_{2} b_{0} & b_{1} & b_{2} )=2. We show that if the following functional equation of Fermat type \left\{a_{0}f(z)+a_{1}f(z+c)+a_{2}f'(z)\right\}^3+\left\{b_{0}f(z)+b_{1}f(z+c)+b_{2}f'(z)\right\}^3=e^{\alpha z+\beta} has meromorphic solutions of finite order, then it has only entire solutions of the form f(z)=Ae^{\frac{\alpha z+\beta}{3}}+Ce^{Dz}, which generalizes the results in {19} and {14}.
