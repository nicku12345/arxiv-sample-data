To explore the relation between properties of Loewner chains and properties of their driving functions, we study Loewner chains driven by functions U of finite total variation. Under some appropriate conditions, we show existence of the simple trace \gamma and establish continuity of the map U to \gamma with respect to uniform topology on \gamma and the total variation topology on U. In the spirit of work of Wong and Tran-Lind, we also obtain conditions on the driving function that ensures the trace to be continuously differentiable.
