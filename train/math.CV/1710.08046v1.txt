We construct examples of flat fiber bundles over the Hopf surface such that the total spaces have no pseudoconvex neighborhood basis, admit a complete K\"ahler metric, or are hyperconvex but have no nonconstant holomorphic functions. For any compact Riemannian surface of positive genus, we construct a flat \mathbb P^1 bundle over it and a Stein domain with real analytic bundary in it whose closure does not have pseudoconvex neighborhood basis. For a compact complex manifold with positive first Betti number, we construct a flat disc bundle over it such that the total space is hyperconvex but admits no nonconstant holomorphic functions.
