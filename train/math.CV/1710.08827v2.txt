The pluripolar hull of a pluripolar set E in \mathbb{P}^n is the intersection of all complete pluripolar sets in \mathbb{P}^n that contain E. We prove that the pluripolar hull of each compact pluripolar set in \mathbb{P}^n is F_\sigma. The convergence set of a divergent formal power series f(z_{0}, \dots,z_{n}) is the set of all "directions" \xi \in\mathbb{P}^{n} along which f is convergent. We prove that the union of the pluripolar hulls of a countable collection of compact pluripolar sets in \mathbb{P}^n is the convergence set of some divergent series f. The convergence sets on \Gamma:=\{[1:z:\psi(z)]: z\in \mathbb{C}\}\subset\mathbb{C}^2\subset\mathbb{P}^2, where \psi is a transcendental entire holomorphic function, are also studied and we obtain that a subset on \Gamma is a convergence set in \mathbb{P}^2 if and only if it is a countable union of compact projectively convex sets, and hence the union of a countable collection of convergence sets on \Gamma is a convergence set.
