Kager, Nienhuis, and Kadanoff conjectured that the hull generated from the Loewner equation driven by two constant functions with constant weights could be generated by a single rapidly and randomly oscillating function. We prove their conjecture and generalize to multiple continuous driving functions. In the process, we generalize to multiple hulls a result of Roth and Schleissinger that says multiple slits can be generated by constant weight functions. The proof gives a simulation method for hulls generated by the multiple Loewner equation.
