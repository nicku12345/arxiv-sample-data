The symmetrized bidisc {\textbf{G}}_{2} is defined by {\textbf{G}}_{2}:=\{(z_1+z_2,z_1z_2)\in\mathbb{C}^2: |z_1|<1,|z_2|<1,\; z_1,z_2\in\mathbb{C}\}. It is a bounded inhomogeneous pseudoconvex domain without \mathcal{C}^1 boundary, and especially the symmetrized bidisc hasn't any strongly pseudoconvex boundary point and the boundary behavior of both Carath\'eodory and Kobayashi metrics over the symmetrized bidisc is hard to describe precisely. In this paper, we study the boundary Schwarz lemma for holomorphic self-mappings of the symmetrized bidisc {\textbf{G}}_2, and our boundary Schwarz lemma in the paper differs greatly from the earlier related results.
