By establishing a unified estimate of the twisted Kohn-Morrey-H\"{o}rmander estimate and the q-pseudoconvex Ahn-Zampieri estimate, we discuss variants of Property (P_q) of Catlin and Property (\widetilde{P_q}) of McNeal on the boundary of a smooth pseudoconvex domain in \mathbb{C}^n for certain high level of forms. These variant conditions on the one side, imply L^2-compactness of the \overline{\partial}-Neumann operator on the associated domain, on the other side, are different from the classical Property (P_q) and Property (\widetilde{P_q}). As an application of our result, we show that if the Hausdorff (2n-2)-dimensional measure of the weakly pseudoconvex points on the boundary of a smooth bounded pseudoconvex domain is zero, then the \overline{\partial}-Neumann operator N_{n-1} is L^2-compact on (0,n-1)-level forms. This result generalizes Boas and Sibony's results on (0,1)-level forms.
