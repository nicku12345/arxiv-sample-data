In this paper, we determine the radii of \beta -uniformly convex of order \alpha  for three kinds of normalized Lommel and Struve functions of the first kind. In the cases considered the normalized Lommel and Struve functions are \beta -uniformly convex functions of order \alpha  on the determined disks. The basic tool of this study is Lommel and Struve functions in series.
