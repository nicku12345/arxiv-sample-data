In this paper we study spaces of holomorphic functions on the Siegel upper half-space \mathcal U and prove Paley-Wiener type theorems for such spaces. The boundary of \mathcal U can be identified with the Heisenberg group \mathbb H_n. Using the group Fourier transform on \mathbb H_n, Ogden-Vagi proved a Paley-Wiener theorem for the Hardy space H^2(\mathcal U).   We consider a scale of Hilbert spaces on \mathcal U that includes the Hardy space, the weighted Bergman spaces, the weighted Dirichlet spaces, and in particular the Drury-Arveson space, and the Dirichlet space \mathcal D. For each of these spaces, we prove a Paley-Wiener theorem, some structure theorems, and provide some applications. In particular we prove that the norm of the Dirichlet space modulo constants \dot{\mathcal D} is the unique Hilbert space norm that is invariant under the action of the group of automorphisms of \mathcal U.
