R. Guralnick [Linear Algebra Appl. 99, 85-96 (1988)] proved that two holomorphic matrices on a noncompact connected Riemann surface, which are locally holomorphically similar, are globally holomorphically similar. In the preprints [arXiv:1703.09524] and [arXiv:1703.09530], a generalization of this to arbitrary (possibly, nonsmooth) 1-dimensional Stein spaces was obtained. The present paper contains a revised version of the proof from [arXiv:1703.09524]. The method of this revised proof can be used also in the higher dimensional case, which will be the subject of a forthcoming paper.
