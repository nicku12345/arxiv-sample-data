Let \mathbb{B} be the unit ball of a complex Banach space X. In this paper, we will generalize the Bloch-type spaces and the little Bloch-type spaces to the open unit ball \mathbb{B} by using the radial derivative. Next, we define an extended Ces\`{a}ro operator T_{\varphi} with holomorphic symbol \varphi and characterize those \varphi for which T_{\varphi} is bounded between the Bloch-type spaces and the little Bloch-type spaces. We also characterize those \varphi for which T_{\varphi} is compact between the Bloch-type spaces and the little Bloch-type spaces under some additional assumption on the symbol \varphi. When \mathbb{B} is the open unit ball of a finite dimensional complex Banach space X, this additional assumption is automatically satisfied.
