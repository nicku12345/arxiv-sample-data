In 1978, Yau confirmed a conjecture due to Calabi stating the existence of K\"ahler metrics with prescribed Ricci forms on compact K\"ahler manifolds. A version of this statement for effective orbifolds can be found in the literature. In this expository article, we provide details for a proof of this orbifold version of the statement by adapting Yau's original continuity method to the setting of effective orbifolds in order to solve a Monge-Amp\`ere equation. We then outline how to obtain K\"ahler-Einstein metrics on orbifolds with c_1(\mathcal{X}) < 0 by solving a slightly different Monge-Amp\`ere equation. We conclude by listing some explicit examples of Calabi-Yau orbifolds, which consequently admit Ricci flat metrics by Yau's theorem for effective orbifolds.
