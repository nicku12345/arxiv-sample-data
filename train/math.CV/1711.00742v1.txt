In this paper, we investigate a new subclass of analytic and m-fold symmetric bi-univalent functions satisfying subordination in the open unit disk U. We consider the Fekete-Szeg\"o inequalities for this class. Also, we establish estimates for the coefficients for this subclas and several related classes are also considered and connections to earlier known results are made.
