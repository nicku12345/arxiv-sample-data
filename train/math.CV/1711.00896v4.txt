Let h and g be two analytic functions in the unit disc \Delta that g(0)=1. Also let \beta be a complex number with {\rm Re}\{\beta\}>-1/2. A function f is said to be log--harmonic mapping if it has the following representation \begin{equation*}   f(z)=z |z|^{2\beta} h(z)\overline{g(z)}\quad (z\in \Delta). \end{equation*} A log--harmonic mapping f is said to be starlike log--harmonic mapping of order \alpha, where 0\leq \alpha<1, if \begin{equation*}   {\rm Re}\left\{\frac{zf_z -\overline{z}f_{\overline{z}}}{f}\right\}>\alpha\quad(z\in \Delta). \end{equation*} In this paper, by use of the subordination principle, we study some geometric properties of the starlike log--harmonic mappings of order \alpha. Also, we estimate the Jacobian of log--harmonic mappings.
