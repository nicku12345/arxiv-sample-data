In this note we study the plurifinely locally maximal plurifinely plurisubharmonic functions and improve some known results on these functions. We prove in particular that any locally bounded plurifinely locally maximal plurifinely plurisubharmonic function is maximal, and that any finite plurisubharmonic function on an open subset of \mathbb{C}^n is maximal if and only if it is plurifinely locally maximal.
