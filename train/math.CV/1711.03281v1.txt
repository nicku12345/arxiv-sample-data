Cauchy and exponential transforms are characterized, and constructed, as canonical holomorphic sections of certain line bundles on the Riemann sphere defined in terms of the Schwarz function. A well known natural connection between Schwarz reflection and line bundles defined on the Schottky double of a planar domain is briefly discussed in the same context.
