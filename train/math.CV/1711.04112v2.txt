Based on a generalization of Bohr's equivalence relation for general Dirichlet series, in this paper we study the sets of values taken by certain classes of equivalent almost periodic functions in their strips of almost periodicity. In fact, the main result of this paper consists of a result like Bohr's equivalence theorem extended to the case of these functions.
