In this paper we study the Hilbert transformations over L^2(\mathbb{R}) and L^2(\mathbb{T}) from the viewpoint of symmetry. For a linear operator over L^2(\mathbb{R}) commutative with the ax+b group we show that the operator is of the form \lambda I+\eta H,  where I and H are the identity operator and Hilbert transformation respectively, and \lambda,\eta are complex numbers. In the related literature this result was proved through first invoking the boundedness result of the operator, proved though a big machinery. In our setting the boundedness is a consequence of the boundedness of the Hilbert transformation. The methodology that we use is Gelfand-Naimark's representation of the ax+b group. Furthermore we prove a similar result on the unit circle. Although there does not exist a group like ax+b on the unit circle, we construct a semigroup to play the same symmetry role for the Hilbert transformations over the circle L^2(\mathbb{T}).
