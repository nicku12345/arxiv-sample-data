This paper aims to obtain decompositions of higher dimensional L^p(\mathbb{R}^n) functions into sums of non-tangential boundary limits of the corresponding Hardy space functions on tubes for the index range 0<p<1. In the one-dimensional case, Deng and Qian \cite{DQ} recently obtained such Hardy space decomposition result: for any function f\in L^p(\mathbb{R}),\ 0<p<1, there exist functions f_1 and f_2 such that f=f_1+f_2, where f_1 and f_2 are, respectively, the non-tangential boundary limits of some Hardy space functions in the upper-half and lower-half planes. In the present paper, we generalize the one-dimensional Hardy space decomposition result to the higher dimensions, and discuss the uniqueness issue of such decomposition.
