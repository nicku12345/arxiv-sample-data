Let D be a bounded domain in \mathbb C^n. We study approximation of (not necessarily bounded from above) m-subharmonic function D by continuous m-subharmonic ones defined on neighborhoods of \overline{D}. We also consider the existence of a m-subharmonic function on D whose boundary values coincides with a given real valued continuous function on \partial D except for a sufficiently small subset of \partial D.
