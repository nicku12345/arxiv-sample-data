Let f:{\mathbb B}^n \to {\mathbb B}^N be a holomorphic map. We study subgroups \Gamma_f \subseteq {\rm Aut}({\mathbb B}^n) and T_f \subseteq {\rm Aut}({\mathbb B}^N). When f is proper, we show both these groups are Lie subgroups. When \Gamma_f contains the center of {\bf U}(n), we show that f is spherically equivalent to a polynomial. When f is minimal we show that there is a homomorphism \Phi:\Gamma_f \to T_f such that f is equivariant with respect to \Phi. To do so, we characterize minimality via the triviality of a third group H_f. We relate properties of {\rm Ker}(\Phi) to older results on invariant proper maps between balls. When f is proper but completely non-rational, we show that either both \Gamma_f and T_f are finite or both are noncompact.
