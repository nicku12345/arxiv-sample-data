Let \Sigma_k(p) be the class of univalent meromorphic functions defined on \mathbb{D} with k-quasiconformal extension to the extended complex plane \widehat{\mathbb{C}}, where 0\leq k < 1. Let \Sigma_k^0(p) be the class of functions f \in \Sigma_k(p) having expansion of the form f(z)= 1/(z-p) + \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}b_n z^{n} on \mathbb{D}. In this article, we obtain sharp area distortion and weighted area distortion inequalities for functions in \Sigma_k^0(p). As a consequence of the obtained results, we present a sharp estimate for the bounds of the Hilbert transform.
