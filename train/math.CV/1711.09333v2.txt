A flag domain of a real from G_0 of a complex semismiple Lie group G is an open G_0-orbit D in a (compact) G-flag manifold. In the usual way one reduces to the case where G_0 is simple. It is known that if D possesses non-constant holomorphic functions, then it is the product of a compact flag manifold and a Hermitian symmetric bounded domain. This pseudoconvex case is rare in the geography of flag domains. Here it is shown that otherwise, i.e., when \mathcal{O}(D)\cong\mathbb{C}, the flag domain D is pseudoconcave. In a rather general setting the degree of the pseudoconcavity is estimated in terms of root invariants. This estimate is explicitly computed for domains in certain Grassmannians.
