In this paper, subordination results are studied for certain subclass of p-valent meromorphic functions in the punctured unit disc having a pole of order p at the origin. The subclass under investigation is defined by using certain new linear operator. Moreover, we also introduced an interesting particular cases of these results in several corollaries.
