In this paper, we determine necessary and sufficient conditions for the generalized Bessel function to be in certain subclasses of starlike and convex functions. Also, we obtain several corollaries as special cases of the main results, these corollaries gives the corresponding results of the familiar, modified and spherical Bessel functions.
