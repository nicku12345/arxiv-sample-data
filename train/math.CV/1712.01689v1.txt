In this paper, we introduce new technique for determining some necessary and sufficient conditions of the normalized Bessel functions j_{\nu}, normalized Struve functions h_{\nu} and normalized Lommel functions s_{\mu,\nu} of the first kind, to be in the subclasses of starlike and convex functions of order \alpha and type \beta.
