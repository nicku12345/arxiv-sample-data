Let M be a complex manifold and PSH^{cb}(M) be the space of bounded continuous plurisubharmonic functions on M. In this paper we study when functions from PSH^{cb}(M) separate points. Our main results show that this property is equivalent to each of the following properties of M:   (1) the core of M is empty.   (2) for every w_0\in M there is a continuous plurisubharmonic function u with the logarithmic singularity at w_0.   Moreover, the core of M is the disjoint union of 1-pseudoconcave in the sense of Rothstein sets E_j with the following Liouville property: every function from PSH^{cb}(M) is constant on each of E_j.
