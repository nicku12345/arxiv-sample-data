Let \mathcal{V}_p(\lambda) be the collection of all functions f defined in the unit disc \ID having a simple pole at z=p where 0<p<1 and analytic in \ID\setminus\{p\} with f(0)=0=f'(0)-1 and satisfying the differential inequality |(z/f(z))^2 f'(z)-1|< \lambda  for z\in \ID, 0<\lambda\leq 1. Each f\in\mathcal{V}_p(\lambda) has the following Taylor expansion:      f(z)=z+\sum_{n=2}^{\infty}a_n(f) z^n, \quad |z|<p.      In \cite{BF-3}, we conjectured that      |a_n(f)|\leq \frac{1-(\lambda p^2)^n}{p^{n-1}(1-\lambda p^2)}\quad \mbox{for}\quad n\geq3.  In the present article, we first obtain a representation formula for functions in the class \mathcal{V}_p(\lambda). Using this representation, we prove the aforementioned conjecture for n=3,4,5 whenever p belongs to certain subintervals of (0,1). Also we determine non sharp bounds for |a_n(f)|,\,n\geq 3 and for |a_{n+1}(f)-a_n(f)/p|,\,n\geq 2.
