A space G(M, \varPhi) of infinitely differentiable functions in {\mathbb R}^n constructed with a help of a family \varPhi=\{\varphi_m\}_{m=1}^{\infty} of real-valued functions \varphi_m \in~C({\mathbb R}^n) and a logarithmically convex sequence M of positive numbers is considered in the article. In view of conditions on M each function of G(M, \varPhi) can be extended to an entire function in {\mathbb C}^n. Imposed conditions on M and \varPhi allow to describe the space of such extensions.
