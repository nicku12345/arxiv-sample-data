In this paper we aim to establish some results depending on the comparative growth properties of composite transcendental entire or meromorphic functions and some special type of differential polynomials generated by one of the factors on the basis of (p,q)-th order and (p,q)-th lower order where p,q are positive integers with p greater than or equal to q.
