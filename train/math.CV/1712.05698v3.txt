In this paper, we establish a truncated non-integrated defect relation for meromorphic mappings from a complete K\"ahler manifold into a projective variety intersecting a family of hypersurfaces located in subgeneral position, where the truncation level of the defect is explicitly estimated. Our result generalizes and improves previous ones. In particular, when the family of hypersurfaces located in general position, our theorem will implies the previous result of Min Ru-Sogome. In the last part of this paper we will apply ours to study the distribution of the Gauss map of minimal surfaces.
