In this paper, a criterion for a sequence of composition operators defined on the space of holomorphic functions in a complex domain to be frequently hypercyclic is provided. Such criterion improves some already known special cases and, in addition, it is also valid to provide dense vector subspaces as well as large closed ones consisting entirely, except for zero, of functions that are frequently hypercyclic.
