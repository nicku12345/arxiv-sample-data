For 0<p\leq\infty, let F^{p}_\varphi be the Fock space induced by a weight function \varphi satisfying  dd^c \varphi \simeq \omega_0. In this paper, given p\in (0, 1] we introduce the concept of weakly localized operators on  F^{p}_\varphi, we characterize the compact operators in the algebra generated by weakly localized operators. As an application, for 0<p<\infty we prove that an operator T in the algebra generated by bounded Toeplitz operators with \textrm{BMO} symbols is compact on F^p_\varphi if and only if its Berezin transform satisfies certain vanishing property at \infty. In the classical Fock space, we extend the Axler-Zheng condition on linear operators T, which ensures T is compact on F^p_{\alpha} for all possible 0<p<\infty.
