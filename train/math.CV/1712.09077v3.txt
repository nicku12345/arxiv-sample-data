We compute the exact norms of the Leray transforms for a family \mathcal{S}_{\beta} of unbounded hypersurfaces in two complex dimensions. The \mathcal{S}_{\beta} generalize the Heisenberg group, and provide local projective approximations to any smooth, strongly \mathbb{C}-convex hypersurface \mathcal{S}_{\beta} to two orders of tangency. This work is then examined in the context of projective dual CR-structures and the corresponding pair of canonical dual Hardy spaces associated to \mathcal{S}_{\beta}, leading to a universal description of the Leray transform and a factorization of the transform through orthogonal projection onto the conjugate dual Hardy space.
