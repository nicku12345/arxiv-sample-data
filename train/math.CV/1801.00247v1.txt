We study spin structures on Riemann and Klein surfaces in terms of divisors. In particular, we take a closer look at spin structures on hyperelliptic and p-gonal surfaces defined by divisors supported on their branch points. Moreover, we study invariant spin divisors under automorphisms and anti-holomorphic involutions of Riemann surfaces.
