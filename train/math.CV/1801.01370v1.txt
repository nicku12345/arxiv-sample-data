In this paper, on the basis of a specific question raised in [6], we further continue our investigations on the uniqueness of a meromorphic function with its higher derivatives sharing two sets and answer the question affirmatively. Moreover, we exhibit some examples to show the sharpness of some conditions used in our main result.
