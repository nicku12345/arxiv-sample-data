Suppose that f is a K-quasiconformal self-mapping of the unit disk \mathbb{D}, which satisfies the following: (1) the biharmonic equation \Delta(\Delta f)=g (g\in \mathcal{C}(\overline{\mathbb{D}})), (2) the boundary condition \Delta f=\varphi (\varphi\in\mathcal{C}(\mathbb{T}) and \mathbb{T} denotes the unit circle), and (3) f(0)=0. The purpose of this paper is to prove that f is Lipschitz continuos, and, further, it is bi-Lipschitz continuous when \|g\|_{\infty} and \|\varphi\|_{\infty} are small enough. Moreover, the estimates are asymptotically sharp as K\to 1, \|g\|_{\infty}\to 0 and \|\varphi\|_{\infty}\to 0, and thus, such a mapping f behaves almost like a rotation for sufficiently small K, \|g\|_{\infty} and \|\varphi\|_{\infty}.
