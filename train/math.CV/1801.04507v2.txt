The purpose of this paper is to study the properties of the solutions to the biharmonic equations: \Delta(\Delta f)=g, where g: \overline{\mathbb{D}}\rightarrow\mathbb{C} is a continuous function and \overline{\mathbb{D}} denotes the closure of the unit disk \mathbb{D} in the complex plane \mathbb{C}. In fact, we establish the following properties for those solutions: Firstly, we establish the Schwarz type lemma. Secondly, by using the obtained results, we get a Landau type theorem. Thirdly, we discuss their Lipschitz type property.
