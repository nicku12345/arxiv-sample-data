For any finite Blaschke product B, there is an injective analytic map \varphi:\mathbb{D}\to\mathbb{C} and a polynomial p of the same degree as B such that B=p\circ\varphi on \mathbb{D}. Several proofs of this result have been given over the past several years, using fundamentally different methods. However, even for low-degree Blaschke products, no method has hitherto been developed to explicitly compute the polynomial p or the associated conformal map \varphi. In this paper, we show how these functions may be computed for a Blaschke product of degree at most three, as well as for Blaschke products of arbitrary degree whose zeros are equally spaced on a circle centered at the origin.
