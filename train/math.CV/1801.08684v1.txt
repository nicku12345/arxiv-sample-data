In this investigation our main aim is to determine the radius of uniform convexity of the some normalized q-Bessel and Wright functions. Here we consider six different normalized forms of q-Bessel functions, while we apply three different kinds of normalizations of Wright function. Also, we have shown that the obtained radii are the smallest positive roots of some functional equations.
