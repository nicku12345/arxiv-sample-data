For \frac12<p<\infty, 0<q<\infty and a certain two-sided doubling weight \omega, we characterize those inner functions \Theta for which \|\Theta'\|_{A^{p,q}_\omega}^q=\int_0^1 \left(\int_0^{2\pi} |\Theta'(re^{i\theta})|^p d\theta\right)^{q/p}   \omega(r)\,dr<\infty. Then we show a modified version of this result for p\ge q. Moreover, two additional characterizations for inner functions whose derivative belongs to the Bergman space A_\omega^{p,p} are given.
