Given a continuous vector field \lambda(t, \cdot) of Sobolev class H^{\frac 32} on the unit circle S^1, the flow maps \eta=g(t, \cdot) of the differential equation  \cases \frac{d\eta}{dt}=\lambda(t, \eta)\\ \eta(0,\zeta)=\zeta \endcases  are known to be quasisymmetric homeomorphisms. Very recently, Gay-Balmaz-Ratiu [GR] conjectured that the flow curve g(t, \cdot) is in the Weil-Petersson class WP(S^1) and is continuously differentiable with respect to the Hilbert manifold structure of WP(S^1) introduced by Takhtajan-Teo [TT]. The first assertion had already been demonstrated in our previous paper [Sh2]. In this sequel to [Sh2], we will continue to deal with the Weil-Petersson class WP(S^1) and completely solve this conjecture in the affirmative.
