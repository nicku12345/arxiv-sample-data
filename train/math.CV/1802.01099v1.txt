We give a proof that every space of weighted square-integrable holomorphic functions admits an equivalent weight whose Bergman kernel has zeroes. Here the weights are equivalent in the sense that they determine the same space of holomorphic functions. Additionally, a family of radial weights in L^1(\mathbb{C}) whose associated Bergman kernels have infinitely many zeroes is exhibited.
