By an easy application of Skoda's theorem on ideal generation, a non-local version of the Briancon-Skoda theorem is obtained. In particular, the symbolic powers I^{(p)} of a zero dimensional radical ideal I generated by r holomorphic functions on an n-dimensional Stein manifold are shown to satisfy I^{(p+q)}\subset I^p for q=\min\{n,r-1\} and all natural p, which contributes to the so-called containment problem.
