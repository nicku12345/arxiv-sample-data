In this paper we characterize the closed invariant subspaces for the (*-)multiplier operator of the quaternionic space of slice L^2 functions. As a consequence, we obtain the inner-outer factorization theorem for the quaternionic Hardy space on the unit ball and we provide a characterization of quaternionic outer functions in terms of cyclicity.
