We prove a Jensen-disc type theorem for polynomials p\in\mathbb{R}[z] having all their zeros in a sector of the complex plane. This result is then used to prove the existence of a collection of linear operators T\colon\mathbb{R}[z]\to\mathbb{R}[z] which map polynomials with their zeros in a closed convex sector |\arg z| \leq \theta<\pi/2 to polynomials with zeros in a smaller sector |\arg z| \leq \gamma<\theta. We, therefore, provide the first example of a zero-sector reducing operator.
