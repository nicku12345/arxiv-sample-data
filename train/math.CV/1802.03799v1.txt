In this paper we investigate an interesting subclass \mathcal{BS}(\alpha) (0\leq \alpha<1) of starlike functions in the unit disk \Delta. The class \mathcal{BS}(\alpha) was introduced by Kargar et al. [R. Kargar, A. Ebadian and J. Sok\'o{\l}, {\it On Booth lemniscate and starlike functions}, Anal. Math. Phys. (2017) DOI: 10.1007/s13324-017-0187-3] which is strongly related to the Booth lemniscate. Some geometric properties of this class of analytic functions including, radius of starlikeness of order \gamma (0\leq\gamma<1), the image of f(\{z:|z|<r\}) when f\in \mathcal{BS}(\alpha), an special example and estimate of bounds for {\rm Re}\{f(z)/z\} are studied.
