In this paper we survey the theory of holomorphic approximation, from the classical 19th century results of Runge and Weierstrass, continuing with the 20th century work of Oka and Weil, Mergelyan, Vitushkin and others, to the most recent ones on higher dimensional manifolds. The paper includes some new results and applications of this theory, especially to manifold-valued maps.
