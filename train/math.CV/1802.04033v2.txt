Let D be a strictly pseudoconvex domain and X be a singular analytic set of pure dimension n-1 in C^n such that X\cap D\neq \emptyset and X\cap bD is transverse. We give sufficient conditions for a function holomorphic on D\cap X to admit a holomorphic extension which belongs to L^q(D), q\in [1,+\infty[, or to BMO(D). The extension is given by mean of integral representation formulas and residue currents.
