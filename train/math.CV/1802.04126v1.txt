The Fock-Bargmann-Hartogs domain D_{n,m}(\mu) (\mu>0) in \mathbb{C}^{n+m} is defined by the inequality \|w\|^2<e^{-\mu\|z\|^2}, where (z,w)\in \mathbb{C}^n\times \mathbb{C}^m, which is an unbounded non-hyperbolic domain in \mathbb{C}^{n+m}. Recently, Tu-Wang obtained the rigidity result that proper holomorphic self-mappings of D_{n,m}(\mu) are automorphisms for m\geq 2, and found a counter-example to show that the rigidity result isn't true for D_{n,1}(\mu). In this article, we obtain a classification of proper holomorphic mappings between D_{n,1}(\mu) and D_{N,1}(\mu) with N<2n.
