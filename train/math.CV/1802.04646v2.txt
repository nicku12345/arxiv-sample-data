In this paper we characterize the zero sets of functions from \ell^{p}_{A} (the analytic functions on the open unit disk D whose Taylor coefficients form an \ell^p sequence) by developing a concept of an "inner function" modeled by Beurling's discussion of the Hilbert space \ell^{2}_{A} (the classical Hardy space). The zero set criterion is used to construct families of zero sets which are not covered by classical results. In particular, it is proved that when p > 2, there are zero sets for \ell^{p}_{A} which are not Blaschke sequences.
