Some geometric properties of a normalized hyper-Bessel functions are investigated. Especially we focus on the radii of starlikeness, convexity, and uniform convexity of hyper-Bessel functions and we show that the obtained radii satisfy some transcendental equations. In addition, we give some bounds for the first positive zero of normalized hyper-Bessel functions, Redheffer-type inequalities, and bounds for this function. In this study we take advantage of Euler-Rayleigh inequalities and Laguerre-P\'{o}lya class of real entire functions, intensively.
