In this paper our aim is to find the radii of starlikeness and convexity of Bessel function derivatives for three different kind of normalization. The key tools in the proof of our main results are the Mittag-Leffler expansion for nth derivative of Bessel function and properties of real zeros of it. In addition, by using the Euler-Rayleigh inequalities we obtain some tight lower and upper bounds for the radii of starlikeness and convexity of order zero for the normalized nth derivative of Bessel function. The main results of the paper are natural extensions of some known results on classical Bessel functions of the first kind.
