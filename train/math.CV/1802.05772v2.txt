Let \mathscr J be the set of inner functions whose derivative lies in the Nevanlinna class. In this paper, we discuss a natural topology on \mathscr J where F_n \to F if the critical structures of F_n converge to the critical structure of F. We show that this occurs precisely when the critical structures of the F_n are uniformly concentrated on Korenblum stars. The proof uses Liouville's correspondence between holomorphic self-maps of the unit disk and solutions of the Gauss curvature equation. Building on the works of Korenblum and Roberts, we show that this topology also governs the behaviour of invariant subspaces of a weighted Bergman space which are generated by a single inner function.
