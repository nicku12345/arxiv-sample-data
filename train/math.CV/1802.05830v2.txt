We construct an Ahlfors-Bers complex analytic model for the Teichm\"uller space of the universal hyperbolic lamination (also known as Sullivan's Teichm\"uller space) and the renormalized Weil-Petersson metric on it as an extension of the usual one. In this setting, we prove that Sullivan's Teichm\"uller space is K\"ahler isometric biholomorphic to the space of continuous functions from the profinite completion of the fundamental group of a compact Riemann surface of genus greater than or equal to two to the Teichm\"uller space of this surface; i.e. We find natural K\"ahler coordinates for the Sullivan's Teichm\"uller space. This is the main result. As a corollary, we show the expected fact that the Nag-Verjovsky embedding is transversal to the Sullivan's Teichm\"uller space contained in the universal one.
