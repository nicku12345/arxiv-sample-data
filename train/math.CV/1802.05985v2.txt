Let f be a non-constant meromorphic function and a = a(z) be a small function of f. Under certain essential conditions, we obtained similar type conclusion of Bruck Conjecture, when f and its differential polynomial P[f] shares a with weight l. Our result improves and generalizes a recent result of Li, Yang, and Liu.
