In this paper we introduce the notions of (p,q)-th relative Gol'dberg order and (p,q)-th relative Gol'dberg type of entire functions of several complex variables where p,q are any positive integers. Then we study some growth properties of entire functions of several complex variables on the basis of their (p,q)-th relative Gol'dberg order and (p,q)-th relative Gol'dberg type.
