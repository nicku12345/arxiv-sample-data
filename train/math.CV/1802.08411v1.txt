In this paper, we introduce finite energy classes of quaternionic plurisubharmonic functions of Cegrell type and study the quaternionic Monge-Ampere operator on these classes on quaternionic hyperconvex domains of Hn. We extend the domain of definition of quaternionic Monge-Ampere operator to some Cegrell classes, the functions of which are not necessarily bounded. We show that integration by parts and comparison principle are valid on some classes. Moreover, we use the variational method to solve the quaternionic Monge-Ampere equations when the right hand side is a positive mea- sure of finite energy.
