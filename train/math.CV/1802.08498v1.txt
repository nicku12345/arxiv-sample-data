Recently, there are many developments on the second main theorem for holomorphic curves into algebraic varieties intersecting divisors in general position or subgeneral position. In this paper, we refine the concept of subgeneral position by introducing the notion of the index of subgeneral position. With this new notion we give some surprising improvement of the previous known second main theorem type results. Moreover, via the analogue between Nevanlinna theory and Diophantine approximation, the corresponding Schmidt's subspace type theorems are also established in the final section.
