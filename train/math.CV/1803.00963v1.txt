Given any infinite tree in the plane satisfying certain topological conditions, we construct an entire function f with only two critical values \pm 1 and no asymptotic values such that f^{-1}([-1,1]) is ambiently homeomorphic to the given tree. This can be viewed as a generalization of a result of Grothendieck to the case of infinite trees. Moreover, a similar idea leads to a new proof of a result of Nevanlinna and Elfving.
