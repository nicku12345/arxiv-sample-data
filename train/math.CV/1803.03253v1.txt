We study the projective logarithmic potential G_\mu of a Probability measure \mu on the complex projective space {P}^{n} equiped with the Fubini-Study metric \omega. We prove that the Green operator G  has strong regularizing properties.   It was shown by the second author that the range of the operator G is contained in the (local) domain of definition of the complex Monge-Amp\`ere operator on P^n. This result extends earlier results by Carlehed.   We will show that the complex Monge-Amp\`ere measure of the logarithmic potential of \mu is absolutely continuous with respect to the Lebesgue measure on P^n if and only if the measure \mu has no atoms.   Moreover when the measure \mu has a "positive dimension", we give more precise results on regularity properties of the potential G_\mu in terms of the dimension of \mu.
