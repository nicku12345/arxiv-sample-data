For a meromorphic function f in the unit disk U=\{z:\;|z|<1\} and arbitrary points z_1,z_2 in U distinct from the poles of f, a sharp upper bound on the product |f'(z_1)f'(z_2)| is established. Further, we prove a sharp distortion theorem involving the derivatives f'(z_1), f'(z_2) and the Schwarzian derivatives S_f(z_1), S_f(z_2) for z_1,z_2\in U. Both estimates hold true under some geometric restrictions on the image f(U).
