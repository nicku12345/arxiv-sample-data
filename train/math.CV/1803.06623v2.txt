\v{C}u\v{c}kovi\'{c} and Paudyal recently characterized the lattice of invariant subspaces of the shift plus a complex Volterra operator on the Hilbert space H^2 on the unit disk. Motivated by the idea of Ong, in this paper, we give a complete characterization of the lattice of invariant subspaces of the shift operator plus a positive integer multiple of the Volterra operator on Hardy spaces H^p, which essentially extends their works to the more general cases when 1\leq p<\infty.
