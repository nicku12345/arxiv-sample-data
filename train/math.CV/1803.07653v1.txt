Let (M,\theta) be a compact strictly pseudoconvex pseudohermitian manifold which is CR embedded into a complex space. In an earlier paper, Lin and the authors gave several sharp upper bounds for the first positive eigenvalue \lambda_1 of the Kohn-Laplacian \Box_b on (M,\theta). In the present paper, we give a sharp upper bound for \lambda_1, generalizing and extending some previous results. As a corollary, we obtain a Reilly-type estimate when M is embedded into the standard sphere. In another direction, using a Lichnerowicz-type estimate by Chanillo, Chiu, and Yang and an explicit formula for the Webster scalar curvature, we give a lower bound for \lambda_1 when the pseudohermitian structure \theta is volume-normalized.
