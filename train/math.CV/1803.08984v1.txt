The aim of the present paper is three folds. Firstly, we complete the study of the weighted hyperholomorphic Bergman space of the second kind on the ball of radius R centred at the origin. The explicit expression of its Bergman kernel is given and can be written in terms of special hypergeometric functions of two non-commuting (quaternionic) variables. Secondly, we introduce and study some basic properties of an associated integral transform, the quaternionic analogue of the so-called second Bargmann transform for the holomorphic Bergman space. Finally, we establish the asymptotic behavior as R goes to infinity. We show in particular that the reproducing kernel of the weighted slice hyperholomorphic Bergman space gives rise to its analogue for the slice hyperholomorphic Bargamann-Fock space.
