For any bounded convex domain \Omega with C^{2} boundary in \mathbb{C}^{n}, we show that there exist positive constants C_{1} and C_{2} such that \[ C_{1}\sqrt{\dfrac{K\left(w,w\right)}{\delta\left(w\right)}}\leq\left\Vert K\left(\cdot,w\right)\right\Vert _{L^{2}\left(\partial\Omega\right)}\leq C_{2}\sqrt{\dfrac{K\left(w,w\right)}{\delta\left(w\right)}}, \] for any w\in\Omega. Here K is the Bergman kernel of \Omega, and \delta is the distance-to-boundary function.
