In this paper, we have investigated the sufficient conditions for periodicity of meromorphic functions and obtained two results directly improving the result of \emph{Bhoosnurmath-Kabbur} \cite{Bho & Kab-2013}, \emph{Qi-Dou-Yang} \cite{Qi & Dou & Yan-ADE-2012} and \emph{Zhang} \cite{Zha-JMMA-2010}. Let \mathcal{S}_{1}=\left\{z:\displaystyle\int_{0}^{z-a}(t-a)^n(t-b)^4dt+1=0\right\} and \mathcal{S}_{2}=\bigg\{a,b\bigg\}, where n\geq 4(n\geq 3) be an integer.\emph{Let f(z) be a non-constant meromorphic (entire) function satisfying \ol E_{f(z)}(\mathcal{S}_j)=\ol E_{f(z+c)}(\mathcal{S}_j), (j=1,\;2) then f(z)\equiv f(z+c).} Some examples have been exhibited to show that, it is not necessary that meromorphic function should be of finite order and also to show that the sets considered in the paper simply can't be replace by arbitrary sets. At the last section, we have posed an open question for the further improvement of the results of this paper.
