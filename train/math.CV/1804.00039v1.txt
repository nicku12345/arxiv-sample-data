The spectral factorization mapping F\to F^+ puts a positive definite integrable matrix function F having an integrable logarithm of the determinant in correspondence with an outer analytic matrix function F^+ such that F = F^+(F^+)^* almost everywhere. The main question addressed here is to what extent \|F^+ - G^+\|_{H_2} is controlled by \|F-G\|_{L_1} and \|\log \det F - \log\det G\|_{L_1}.
