Given a proper, open, holomorphic map of K\"ahler manifolds, whose general fibers are Calabi-Yau manifolds, the volume forms for the Ricci-flat metrics induce a hermitian metric on the relative canonical bundle over the regular locus of the family. We show that the curvature form extends as a closed positive current. Consequently the Weil-Petersson metric extends as a positive current. In the projective case, the Weil-Petersson form is known to be the curvature of a certain determinant line bundle, equipped with a Quillen metric. As an application we get that after blowing up the singular locus, the determinant line bundle extends, and the Quillen metric extends as singular hermitian metric, whose curvature is a positive current.
