The purpose of this paper is to study the Sarason's problem on Fock spaces of polyanalytic functions. Namely, given two polyanalytic symbols f and g, we establish a necessary and sufficient condition for the boundedness of some Toeplitz products  T_{f}T_{\bar g} subjected to certain restriction on f and g. We also characterize this property in terms of the Berezin transform.
