We study the solvability in L^p of the \bar\partial-equation in a neighborhood of a canonical singularity on a complex surface, a so-called du Val singularity. We get a quite complete picture in case p=2 for two natural closed extensions \bar\partial_s and \bar\partial_w of \bar\partial. For \bar\partial_s we have solvability, whereas for \bar\partial_w there is solvability if and only if a certain boundary condition (*) is fulfilled at the singularity. Our main tool is certain integral operators for solving \bar\partial introduced by the first and fourth author, and we study mapping properties of these operators at the singularity.
