Expected duality and approximation properties are shown to fail on Bergman spaces of domains in \mathbb{C}^n, via examples. When the domain admits an operator satisfying certain mapping properties, positive duality and approximation results are proved. Such operators are constructed on generalized Hartogs triangles. On a general bounded Reinhardt domain, norm convergence of Laurent series of Bergman functions is shown. This extends a classical result on Hardy spaces of the unit disc.
