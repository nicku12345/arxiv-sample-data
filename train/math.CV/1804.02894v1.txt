Let u be a maximal plurisubharmonic function in a domain \Omega\subset\mathbb{C}^n (n\geq 2). It is classical that, for any U\Subset\Omega, there exists a sequence of bounded plurisubharmonic functions PSH(U)\ni u_j\searrow u satisfying the property: (dd^c u_j)^n is weakly convergent to 0 as j\rightarrow\infty. In general, this property does not hold for arbitrary sequence. In this paper, we show that for any sequence of bounded plurisubharmonic functions PSH(U)\ni u_j\searrow u, (|u_j|+1)^{-a} (dd^cu_j)^n is weakly convergent to 0 as j\rightarrow\infty, where a>n-1. We also generalize some well-known results about approximation of maximal plurisubharmonic functions.
