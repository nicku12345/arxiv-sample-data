Let N^p (1<p<\infty) denote the algebra of holomorphic functions in the open unit disk, introduced by I.~I.~Privalov with the notation A_q in [8]. Since N^p becomes a ring of Nevanlinna--Smirnov type in the sense of Mortini [7], the results from [7] can be applied to the ideal structure of the ring N^p. In particular, we observe that N^p has the Corona Property. Finally, we prove the N^p-analogue of the Theorem 6 in [7], which gives sufficient conditions for an ideal in N^p, generated by a finite number of inner functions, to be equal to the whole algebra N^p.
