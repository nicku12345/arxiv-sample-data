We study the Dirichlet problem for the semi--linear partial differential equations {\rm div}\,(A\nabla u)=f(u) in simply connected domains D of the complex plane \mathbb C with continuous boundary data. We prove the existence of the weak solutions u in the class C\cap W^{1,2}_{\rm loc}(D) if a Jordan domain D satisfies the quasihyperbolic boundary condition by Gehring--Martio. An example of such a domain that fails to satisfy the standard (A)--condition by Ladyzhenskaya--Ural'tseva and the known outer cone condition is given. We also extend our results to simply connected non-Jordan domains formulated in terms of the prime ends by Caratheodory. Our approach is based on the theory of the logarithmic potential, singular integrals, the Leray--Schauder technique and a factorization theorem in \cite{GNR2017}. This theorem allows us to represent u in the form u=U\circ\omega, where \omega(z) stands for a quasiconformal mapping of D onto the unit disk {\mathbb D}, generated by the measurable matrix function A(z), and U is a solution of the corresponding quasilinear Poisson equation in the unit disk {\mathbb D}. In the end, we give some applications of these results to various processes of diffusion and absorption in anisotropic and inhomogeneous media.
