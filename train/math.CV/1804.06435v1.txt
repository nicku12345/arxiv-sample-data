In 2011, Sok\'{o}{\l} (Comput. Math. Appl. 62, 611--619) introduced and studied the class \mathcal{SK}(\alpha) as a certain subclass of starlike functions, consists of all functions f (f(0)=0=f'(0)-1) which satisfy in the following subordination relation: \begin{equation*} \frac{zf'(z)}{f(z)}\prec \frac{3}{3+(\alpha-3)z-\alpha z^2} \qquad |z|<1, \end{equation*} where -3<\alpha\leq1. Also, he obtained some interesting results for the class \mathcal{SK}(\alpha). In this paper, some another properties of this class, including infimum of \mathfrak{Re}\frac{f(z)}{z}, order of strongly starlikeness, the sharp logarithmic coefficients inequality and the sharp Fekete-Szeg\"{o} inequality are investigated.
