We establish a Wiman-Valiron theory for a polynomial series based on the Wilson operator \mathcal{D}_\mathrm{W}. For an entire function f of order smaller than \frac13, this theory includes (i) an estimate which shows that f behaves locally like a polynomial consisting of the terms near the maximal term in its Wilson series expansion, and (ii) an estimate of \mathcal{D}_\mathrm{W}^n f compared to f. We then apply this theory in studying the growth of entire solutions to difference equations involving the Wilson operator.
