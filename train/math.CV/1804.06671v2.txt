We study the relation between the boundary of a simply connected domain being Ahlfors-regular and the invariance of Carleson measures under the push-forward operator induced by a conformal mapping from the unit disk onto the domain. As an application, we characterize the chord-arc curve with small norm and the asymptotically smooth curve in terms of the complex dilatation of some quasiconformal reflection with respect to the curve.
