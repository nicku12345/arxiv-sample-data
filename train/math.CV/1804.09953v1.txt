Sendov's conjecture states that if all the zeroes of a complex polynomial P(z) of degree at least two lie in the unit disk, then within a unit distance of each zero lies a critical point of P(z). In a paper that appeared in 2014, D\'{e}got proved that, for each a\in (0,1), there exists an integer N such that for any polynomial P(z) with degree greater than N, if P(a) = 0 and all zeroes lie inside the unit disk, the disk |z-a|\leq 1 contains a critical point of P(z). Based on this result, we derive an explicit formula \mathcal{N}(a) for each a \in (0,1) and, consequently obtain a uniform bound N for all a\in [\alpha , \beta] where 0<\alpha < \beta < 1. This (partially) addresses the questions posed in D\'{e}got's paper.
