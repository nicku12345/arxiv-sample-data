We study density currents associated with a collection of positive closed (1,1)-currents. We prove that the density current is unique and determined by the usual wedge product in some classical situations including the case where the currents have bounded potentials. As an application, we compare density currents with the non-pluripolar product and the Andersson-Wulcan product. We also analyse some situations where the wedge product is not well-defined but the density can be explicitly computed.
