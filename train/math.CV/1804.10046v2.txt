Dorff et al. \cite{DN} formulated a question concerning the convolution of two right half-plane mappings, where the normalization of the functions was considered incorrectly. In this paper, we have reformulated the open problem in correct form and provided a solution to it in a more general form. In addition, we also obtain two new theorems which correct and improve some other results.
