In this paper, we investigate an upper bound of the polar derivative of a polynomial of degree n p(z)=(z-z_m)^{t_m} (z-z_{m-1})^{t_{m-1}}\cdots (z-z_0)^{t_0}(a_0+\sum\limits_{\nu=\mu} ^{n-(t_m+\cdots+t_0)} a_{\nu}z^\nu) where zeros z_0,\ldots,z_m are in \{z:|z|<1\} and the remaining n-(t_m+\cdots+t_0 ) zeros are outside \{z:|z|<k\} where k \geq 1. Furthermore, we give a lower bound of this polynomial where zeros z_0,\ldots,z_m are outside \{z:|z|\leq k\} and the remaining n-(t_m+\cdots+t_0 ) zeros are in \{z:|z|<k\} where k\leq 1.
