In this paper we obtain a Carleman approximation theorem for maps from Stein manifolds to Oka manifolds. More precisely, we show that under suitable complex analytic conditions on a totally real set  M  of a Stein manifold X, every smooth map  X \rightarrow Y  to an Oka manifold Y satisfying the Cauchy-Riemann equations along  M  up to order  k  can be  \mathscr{C}^k -Carleman approximated by holomorphic maps  X \rightarrow Y . Moreover, if  K  is a compact  \mathscr{O}(X) -convex set such that  K \cup M  is  \mathscr{O}(X) -convex, then we can  \mathscr{C}^k -Carleman approximate maps which satisfy the Cauchy-Riemann equations up to order  k  along  M  and are holomorphic on a neighbourhood of  K , or merely in the interior of K if the latter set is the closure of a strongly pseudoconvex domain.
