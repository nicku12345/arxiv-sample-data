The aim of this short note is to investigate the geometry of weakly complete subdomains of Grauert type surfaces, i.e. open connected sets D, sitting inside a Grauert type surface X, which admit a smooth plurisubharmonic exhaustion function. We prove that they are either modifications of Stein spaces or Grauert type surfaces themselves and we apply these results to the special case of Hopf surfaces.
