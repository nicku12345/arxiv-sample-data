It is shown in quantitative terms that the maximal Bergman projection   \begin{equation*}   P^{+}_\omega(f)(z)=\int_\mathbb{D} f(\zeta)|B^\omega_z(\zeta)|\omega(\zeta)\,dA(\zeta),   \end{equation*} is bounded from L^p_\nu to L^p_\eta if and only if   \begin{equation*}   \sup_{0<r<1}\left(\int_0^r\frac{\eta(s)}{\left(\int_{s}^1\omega(t)\,dt\right)^p}\,ds\right)^{\frac{1}{p}}   \left(\int_r^1\left(\frac{\omega(s)}{\nu(s)^\frac{1}{p}}\right)^{p'}ds\right)^{\frac{1}{p'}}<\infty,   \end{equation*} provided \omega,\nu,\eta are radial regular weights. A radial weight \sigma is regular if it satisfies \sigma(r)\asymp\int_{r}^1\sigma(t)\,dt/(1-r) for all 0\leq r<1. It is also shown that under an appropriate additional hypothesis involving \omega and \eta, the Bergman projection P_\omega and P^+_\omega are simultaneously bounded.
