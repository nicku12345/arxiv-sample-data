In a recent series of articles (arXiv:1604.06655, arXiv:1708.09267), the authors have studied the transition behavior of partial Bergman kernels \Pi_{k, [E_1, E_2]}(z,w) and the associated DOS (density of states) \Pi_{k, [E_1, E_2]}(z) across the interface \ccal between the allowed and forbidden regions. Partial Bergman kernels are Toeplitz Hamiltonians quantizing Morse functions H: M \to \R on a \kahler manifold. The allowed region is H^{-1}([E_1, E_2]) and the interface \ccal is its boundary. In prior articles it was assumed that the endpoints E_j were regular values of H. This article completes the series by giving parallel results when an endpoint is a critical value of H. In place of the Erf scaling asymptotics in a k^{-\half}  tube around \ccal for regular interfaces, one obtains \delta-asymptotics in k^{-\frac{1}{4}}-tubes around singular points of a critical interface. In k^{-\half} tubes, the transition law is given by the osculating metaplectic propagator.
