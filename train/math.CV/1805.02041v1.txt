This paper deals with the set of the real projections of the zeros of an arbitrary almost periodic function defined in a vertical strip U. It provides practical results in order to determine whether a real number belongs to the closure of such a set. Its main result shows that, in the case that the Fourier exponents \{\lambda_1,\lambda_2,\lambda_3,\ldots\} of an almost periodic function are linearly independent over the rational numbers, such a set has no isolated points in U.
