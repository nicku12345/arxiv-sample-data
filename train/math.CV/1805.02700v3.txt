In the present paper, we investigate non-homeomorphic mappings of Riemannian surfaces of Sobolev class. We have obtained some estimates of distortion of moduli of families of curves. As consequence, we have obtained results about the boundary behavior of such mappings between domains on Riemannian surfaces.
