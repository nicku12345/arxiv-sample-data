In the present paper two certain subclasses of the starlike functions associated with the vertical strip are considered. The main aim of this paper is to investigate some basic properties of these classes such as, subordination relations, sharp inequalities for sums involving logarithmic coefficients and estimate of logarithmic coefficients.
