We study certain densely defined unbounded operators on the Fock space. These are the annihilation and creation operators of quantum mechanics. In several complex variables we have the \partial-operator and its adjoint \partial^* acting on (p,0)-forms with coefficients in the Fock space. We consider the corresponding \partial-complex and study spectral properties of the corresponding complex Laplacian \tilde \Box = \partial \partial^* + \partial^*\partial. Finally we study a more general complex Laplacian \tilde \Box_D = D D^* + D^* D, where D is a differential operator of polynomial type, to find the canonical solutions to the inhomogeneous equations Du=\alpha and D^*v=\beta.
