Let h be a quasiconformal (qc) mapping of the unit disk \mathbb{U} onto a Lyapunov domain. We show that h maps subdomains of Lyapunov type of \mathbb{U}, which touch the boundary of \mathbb{U}, onto domains of similar type. In particular if h is a harmonic qc (hqc) mapping of \mathbb{U} onto a Lyapunov domain, using it, we prove that h is co-Lipschitz (co-Lip) on \mathbb{U}. This settles an open intriguing problem.
