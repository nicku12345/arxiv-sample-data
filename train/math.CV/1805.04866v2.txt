A one-component inner function \Theta is an inner function whose level set   \Omega_{\Theta}(\varepsilon)=\{z\in \mathbb{D}:|\Theta(z)|<\varepsilon\} is connected for some \varepsilon\in (0,1). We give a sufficient condition for a Blaschke product with zeros in a Stolz domain to be a one-component inner function. Moreover, a sufficient condition is obtained in the case of atomic singular inner functions.   We study also derivatives of one-component inner functions in the Hardy and Bergman spaces. For instance, it is shown that, for 0<p<\infty, the derivative of a one-component inner function \Theta is a member of the Hardy space H^p if and only if \Theta'' belongs to the Bergman space A_{p-1}^p, or equivalently \Theta'\in A_{p-1}^{2p}.
