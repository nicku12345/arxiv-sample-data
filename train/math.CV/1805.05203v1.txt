This is a partly expository article for the volume "Algebraic and Analytic Microlocal Analysis" on pointwise Weyl laws for spectral projections kernels in the Kaehler setting. We prove a 2-term pointwise Weyl law for projections onto sums of eigenspaces of spectral width \hbar=k^{-1} of Toeplitz quantizations \hat{H}_k of Hamiltonians on a Kaehler manifold. The first result is a complete asymptotic expansion for smoothed spectral projections in terms of periodic orbit data. When the orbit is `strongly hyperbolic' the leading coefficient defines a uniformly continuous measure on \R and a semi-classical Tauberian theorem implies the 2-term expansion. As in previous works in the series, we use scaling asymptotics of the Boutet-de-Monvel-Sjostrand parametrix and Taylor expansions to reduce the proof to the Bargmann-Fock case.
