A new approach to the problem of the zero distribution of Hermite-Pad\'e polynomials of type I for a pair of functions f_1,f_2 forming a Nikishin system is discussed. Unlike the traditional vector approach, we give an answer in terms of a scalar equilibrium problem with harmonic external field, which is posed on a two-sheeted Riemann surface.
