We clarify the linear algebra used in the quaternionic pluripotential theory so that proofs of several results there can be greatly simplified. In particular, we characterize and normalize real 2-forms with respect to the quaternionic structure, and show that the Moore determinant of a quaternionic hyperhermitian matrix is the coefficient of the exterior product of the associated real 2-form. As a corollary, the quaternionic Monge-Amp\`{e}re operator is the coefficient of the exterior product of the Baston operator.
