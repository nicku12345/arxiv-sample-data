Let p:\mathbb{C} \rightarrow \mathbb{C} be a polynomial. The Gauss-Lucas theorem states that its critical points, p'(z) = 0, are contained in the convex hull of its roots. We prove a stability version whose simplest form is as follows: suppose p has n+m roots where n are inside the unit disk,  \max_{1 \leq i \leq n}{|a_i|} \leq 1, \quad \mbox{and m are outside} \quad \min_{n+1 \leq i \leq n+m}{ |a_i|} \geq d > 1 + \frac{2 m}{n}, then p' has n-1 roots inside the unit disk and m roots at distance at least (dn - m)/(n+m) > 1 from the origin and the involved constants are sharp. We also discuss a pairing result: in the setting above, for n sufficiently large each of the m roots has a critical point at distance \sim n^{-1}.
