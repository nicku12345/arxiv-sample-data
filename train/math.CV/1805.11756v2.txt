We study the density of polynomials in H^2(\Omega,e^{-\varphi}), the space of square integrable holomorphic functions in a bounded domain \Omega in \mathbb{C}, where \varphi is a subharmonic function. In particular, we prove that the density holds in Carath\'{e}odory domains for any subharmonic function \varphi in a neighborhood of \overline{\Omega}. In non-Carath\'{e}odory domains, we prove that the density depends on the weight function, giving examples.
