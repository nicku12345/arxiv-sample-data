This paper aims at studying a functional K-transformation w\left( z \right)\to \widetilde{w}\left( z \right)=w\left( z \right)K\left( z \right) that is made to reconsider the complex differentiability for a given complex function w and subsequently we obtain structural holomorphic to judge a complex function to be complex structural differentiable. Since K\left( z \right) can be chosen arbitrarily, thus it has greatly generalized the applied practicability. And we particularly consider K \left( z \right)= 1+\kappa \left( z \right), then we found an unique Carleman-Bers-Vekua equations which is more simpler that all coefficients are dependent to the structural function \kappa \left( z \right). The generalized exterior differential operator and the generalized Wirtinger derivatives are simultaneously obtained as well. As a discussion, second-order nonlinear Laplace equation is studied.
