We prove that a family of quasiregular mappings of a domain \Omega which are uniformly bounded in L^p for some p>0 form a normal family. From this we show how an elliptic estimate on a functional differences implies all directional derivatives, and thus the complex gradient to be quasiregular. Consequently the function enjoys much higher regularity than apriori assumptions suggest.
