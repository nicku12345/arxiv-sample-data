Let M be an n-dimensional d-bounded Stein manifold M, i.e., a complex n-dimensional manifold M admitting a smooth strictly plurisubharmonic exhaustion \rho and endowed with the K\"ahler metric whose fundamental form is \omega=i\partial\overline{\partial}\rho, such that i\overline{\partial}\rho has bounded L^\infty norm. We prove a vanishing result for W^{1,2} harmonic forms with respect to the Bott-Chern Laplacian on M.
