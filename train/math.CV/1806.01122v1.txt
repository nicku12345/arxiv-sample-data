In a previous paper by Ferreira and L\'opez [Journal of Mathematical Analysis and Applications, 298(1), 2004], the authors derived an asymptotic expansion of the Lerch's transcendent \Phi(z,s,a) for large \vert a\vert, valid for \mathrm{Re}(a)>0, \mathrm{Re}(s)>0 and z\in\mathbb{C}\setminus[1,\infty). In this paper we study the special case z\ge 1 not covered in the previous result, deriving a complete asymptotic expansion of the Lerch's transcendent \Phi(z,s,a) for z > 1 and \mathrm{Re}(s)>0 as \mathrm{Re}(a) goes to infinity. We also show that when a is a positive integer, this expansion is convergent for \mathrm{Re}(z) \ge 1. As a corollary, we get a full asymptotic expansion for the sum \sum_{n=1}^{m} z^{n}/n^{s} for fixed z >1  as m \to \infty. Some numerical results show the accuracy of the approximation.
