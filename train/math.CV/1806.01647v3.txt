In this article, we establish some new second main theorems for meromorphic mappings of \mathbb C^m into \mathbb P^n(\mathbb C) and moving hyperplanes with truncated counting functions. Our results are improvements of the previous second main theorems for moving hyperplanes with truncated (to level n) counting functions.
