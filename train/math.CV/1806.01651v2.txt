In this paper, we prove some results in normal family of meromorphic mappings intersecting with moving hypersurfaces. As some applications, we establish some results for normal mapping and extension of holomorphic mappings. A our result is strongly extended the Montel's normal criterion in the case several variables which is due to Tu in [Proc. Amer. Math. Soc. 127,1039-1049, 1999]. Our results are also strongly extended the results of Tu-Li in [Sci. China Ser. A. 48, 355-364, 2005] and [J. Math. Anal. Appl. 342, 629-638, 2006].
