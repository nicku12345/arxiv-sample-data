Let f be a transcendental meromorphic function, defined in the complex plane \mathbb{C}. In this paper, we give a quantitative estimations of the characteristic function T(r,f) in terms of the counting function of a homogeneous differential polynomial generated by f. Our result improves and generalizes some recent results.
