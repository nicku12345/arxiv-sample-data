An important open problem in geometric complex analysis is to find algorithms for explicit determination of basic functionals intrinsically connected with conformal and quasiconformal maps, such as their Teichmuller and Grunsky norms, Fredholm eigenvalues and the quasireflection coefficient. This has not been solved even for convex polygons. This case has intrinsic interest in view of the connection of such polygons with the geometry of the universal Teichmuller space.   We provide a new approach, based on affine transformations of univalent functions.
