Let M be a real-analytic connected CR-hypersurface of CR-dimension n>0 having a point of Levi-nondegeneracy. The following alternative is demonstrated for both the symmetry algebra s and the automorphism group G of M. Denote by d the dimension of s or G. Then (i) either d=n^2+4n+3 and M is spherical everywhere; (ii) or d\le n^2+2n+2+\delta_{2,n} and in the case of equality M is spherical of fixed Levi signature in the open dense subset of Levi-nondegenerate points.   Explicit examples of CR-hypersurfaces and their infinitesimal and global automorphisms realizing the bound in (ii) are constructed. We provide many other models with large symmetry using the technique of blow-up, in particular we realize all maximal parabolic subalgebras of the pseudo-unitary algebras as a symmetry.
