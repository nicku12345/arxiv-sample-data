There are three types of results in this paper. The first, extending a representation theorem on a conformal mapping that omits two values of equal modulus. This was due to Brickman and Wilken. They constructed a representation as a convex combination with two terms. Our representation constructs convex combinations with unlimited number of terms. In the limit one can think of it as an integration over a probability space with the uniform distribution. The second result determines the sign of \Re L(\overline{z}_0(f(z))^2) up to a remainder term which is expressed using a certain integral that involves the L\"owner chain induced by f(z), for a support point f(z) which maximizes \Re L. Here L is a continuous linear functional on H(U), the topological vector space of the holomorphic functions in the unit disk U=\{z\in\mathbb{C}\,|\,|z|<1\}. Such a support point is known to be a slit mapping and f(z_0) is the tip of the slit \mathbb{C}-f(U). The third demonstrates some properties of support points of the subspace S_n of S. S_n contains all the polynomials in S of degree n or less. For instance such a support point p(z) has a zero of its derivative p'(z) on \partial U.
