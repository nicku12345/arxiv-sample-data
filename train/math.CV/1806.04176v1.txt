We continue our study of the set \mathfrak I_c of inner functions u in H^\infty with the property that there is \eta\in ]0,1[ such that the level set \Omega_u(\eta):=\{z\in\mathbb D: |u(z)|<\eta\} is connected. These functions are called one-component inner functions. They play an important role in function theory and operator theory. Here we show that the composition of two one-component inner functions is again in \mathfrak I_c. We also give conditions under which a factor of one-component inner function belongs to \mathfrak I_c.
