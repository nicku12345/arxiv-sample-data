It is shown that no purely topological condition implies the equality of the polynomial and rational hulls of a set: For any compact subset K of a Euclidean space, there exists a set X, in some {\mathbb C}^N, that is homeomorphic to K and is rationally convex but not polynomially convex. In addition, it is shown that for the surfaces in {\mathbb C}^3 constructed by Izzo and Stout, whose polynomial hulls are nontrivial but contain no analytic discs, the polynomial and rational hulls coincide, thereby answering a question of Gupta. Equality of polynomial and rational hulls is shown also for m-dimensional manifolds (m\geq 2) with polynomial hulls containing no analytic discs constructed by Izzo, Samuelsson Kalm, and Wold and by Arosio and Wold.
