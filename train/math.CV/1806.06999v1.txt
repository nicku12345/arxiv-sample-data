S. Koumandos and S. Ruscheweyh posed the following conjecture: For \rho\in(0,1] and 0<\mu\leq\mu^{\ast}(\rho), the partial sum s_n^{\mu}(z)=\displaystyle\sum_{k=0}^n \frac{(\mu)_k}{k!}z^k, 0<\mu\leq1, |z|<1, satisfies % \begin{align*} (1-z)^{\rho}s_n^{\mu}(z) \prec \left(\frac{1+z}{1-z}\right)^{\rho}, \qquad n\in \mathbb{N}, \end{align*} where \mu^{\ast}(\rho) is the unique solution of \begin{align*} \int_0^{(\rho+1)\pi} \sin(t-\rho\pi)t^{\mu-1}dt=0. \end{align*} This conjecture is already settled for \rho=\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{4}, \frac{3}{4} and \rho=1. In this work, we validate this conjecture for an open neighbourhood of \rho=\frac{1}{3} and in a weaker form for \rho=\frac{2}{3}. The particular value of the conjecture leads to several consequences related to starlike functions.
