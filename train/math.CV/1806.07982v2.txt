We establish a new characterization for a conformal mapping of the unit disk \mathbb{D} to be convex, and identify the mappings onto a half-plane or a parallel strip as extremals. We also show that, with these exceptions, the level sets of \lambda of the Poincar\'e metric \lambda|dw| of a convex domain are strictly convex.
