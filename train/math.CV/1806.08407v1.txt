The fractional q-calculus is the q-extension of the ordinary fractional calculus and dates back to early 20-th century. The theory of q-calculus operators are used in various areas of science such as ordinary fractional calculus, optimal control, q-difference and q-integral equations, and also in the geometric function theory of complex analysis. In this article, for the first time, we apply certain q-calculus operators to complex harmonic functions and obtain sharp coefficient bounds, distortion theorems and covering results.
