Using the notion of commutative operator vessels, this work investigates de Branges-Rovnyak spaces whose elements are sections of a line bundle of multiplicative half-order differentials on a compact real Riemann surface. As a special case, we obtain a Beurling-Lax type theorem in the setting of the corresponding Hardy space on a finite bordered Riemann surface.
