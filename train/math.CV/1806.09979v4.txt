We consider the behaviour at a boundary point of an open subset U\subset\mathbb{C} of distributions that are holomorphic on U and belong to what are called negative Lipschitz classes. The result explains the significance for holomorphic functions of series of Wiener type involving Hausdorff contents of dimension between 0 and 1. We begin with a survey about function spaces and capacities that sets the problem in context and reviews the relevant general theory. The techniques used include the construction of a special partition of the identity that may be of independent interest.
