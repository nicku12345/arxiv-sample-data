According to [5] we define the *-exponential of a slice-regular function, which can be seen as a generalization of the complex exponential to quaternions. Explicit formulas for \exp_*(f) are provided, also in terms of suitable sine and cosine functions. We completely classify under which conditions the *-exponential of a function is either slice-preserving or \mathbb{C}_J-preserving for some J\in\mathbb{S} and show that \exp_*(f) is never-vanishing. Sharp necessary and sufficient conditions are given in order that \exp_*(f+g)=\exp_*(f)*\exp_*(g), finding an exceptional and unexpected case in which equality holds even if f and g do not commute. We also discuss the existence of a square root of a slice-preserving regular function, characterizing slice-preserving functions (defined on the circularization of simply connected domains) which admit square roots. Square roots of this kind of functions are used to provide a further formula for \exp_{*}(f). A number of examples is given throughout the paper.
