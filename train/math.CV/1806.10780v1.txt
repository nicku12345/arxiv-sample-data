We study the Lelong classes \mathcal{L}(V),\mathcal{L}^+(V) of psh functions on an affine variety V. We compute the Monge-Amp\`ere mass of these functions, which we use to define the degree of a polynomial on V in terms of pluripotential theory (the Lelong degree). We compute the Lelong degree explicitly in a specific example. Finally, we derive an affine version of B\'ezout's theorem.
