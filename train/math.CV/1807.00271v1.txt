We consider a class of domains, generalizing the upper half-plane, and admitting rotational, translational and scaling symmetries, analogous to the half-plane. We prove Paley-Wiener type representations of functions in Bergman spaces of such domains with respect to each of these three groups of symmetries. The Fourier series, Fourier integral and Mellin integral representations so obtained may be used to give representations of the Bergman kernels of these domains.
