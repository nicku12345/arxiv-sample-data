These are notes for the CIME school on Complex non-K\"ahler geometry from July 9th to July 13th of 2018 in Cetraro, Italy. It is an overview of different properties of a class of non-K\"ahler compact complex manifolds called LVMB manifolds, obtained as the Hausdorff space of leaves of systems of commuting complex linear equations in an open set in complex projective space {{mathbb P}_{\mathbb C}}^{n-1}
