Given a smooth foliation by complex curves (locally around a point x\in\mathbb{C}^2\setminus\{0\}) which is "compatible" with the foliation by spheres centered at the origin, we construct a smooth real-valued function g in a neighborhood of said point, which is positive, homogeneous and constant along the leaves. A corollary we obtain from this is relevant to the problem of "bumping out" certain pseudoconvex domains in \mathbb{C}^3.
