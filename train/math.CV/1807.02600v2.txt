Classic complex analysis is built on structural function K=1 only associated with Cauchy-Riemann equations, subsequently various generalizations of Cauchy-Riemann equations start to break this situation. The goal of this article is to show that only structural function K=Const such that Liouville's theorem is held, otherwise, it's not valid any more on complex domain based on structural holomorphic, the correction should be w=\Phi {{e}^{-K}}, where \Phi =Const. Those theories in complex analysis which keep constant are unable to be held as constant in the framework of structural holomorphic. Synchronously, it deals with the generalization of Cauchy's integral theorem by using the new perspective of structural holomorphic, it is also shown that some of theories in the complex analysis are special cases at K=Const, which are narrow to be applied such as maximum modulus principle.
