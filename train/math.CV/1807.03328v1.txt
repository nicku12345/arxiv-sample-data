We consider the class \mathcal{S}^*(q_c) of normalized starlike functions f analytic in the open unit disk |z|<1 that satisfying the inequality \begin{equation*}   \left|\left(\frac{zf'(z)}{f(z)}\right)^2-1\right|<c \quad   (0<c\leq1). \end{equation*} In this article, we present some subordination relations and these relations are then used to obtain some corollaries for some subclass of analytic functions.
