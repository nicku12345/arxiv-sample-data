Let f=h+\overline{g} be a harmonic univalent map in the unit disk \mathbb{D}, where h  and g are analytic. We obtain an improved estimate for the second coefficient of h. This indeed is the first qualitative improvement after the appearance of the papers by Clunie and Sheil-Small in 1984, and by Sheil-Small in 1990. Also, when the sup-norm of the dilatation is less than 1, it is shown that the spherical area of the covering surface of h is dominated by the spherical area of the covering surface of f.
