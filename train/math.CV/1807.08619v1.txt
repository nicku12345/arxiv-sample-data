Two meromorphic functions f and g are said to share the set S\subset \mathbb{C}\cup\{\infty\} with weight l\in\mathbb{N}\cup\{0\}\cup\{\infty\}, if E_{f}(S,l)=E_{g}(S,l) where E_{f}(S,l)=\bigcup\limits_{a \in S}\{(z,t) \in \mathbb{C}\times\mathbb{N}~ |~ f(z)=a ~\text{with~ multiplicity}~ p\}, where t=p if p\leq l and t=p+1 if p>l.   In this paper, we improve and supplement the result of L. W. Liao and C. C. Yang (On the cardinality of the unique range sets for meromorphic and entire functions, Indian J. Pure appl. Math., 31 (2000), no. 4, 431-440) by showing that there exist a finite set S with cardinality \geq 13 such that E_{f}(S,1)=E_{g}(S,1) implies f\equiv g.
