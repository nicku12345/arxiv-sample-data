It is known that if f: D_1 \to D_2 is a polynomial biholomorphism with polynomial inverse and constant Jacobian then D_1 is a 1-point Quadrature domain (the Bergman span contains all holomorphic polynomials) of order 1 whenever D_2 is a balanced domain. Bell conjectured that all 1-point Quadrature domains arise in this manner. In this note, we construct a 1-point Quadrature domain of order 1 that is not biholomorphic to any balanced domain.
