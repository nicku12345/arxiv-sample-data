The Fridman invariant, which is a biholomorphic invariant on Kobayashi hyperbolic manifolds, can be seen as the dual of the much studied squeezing function. We compare this pair of invariants by showing that they are both equally capable of determining the boundary geometry of a bounded domain if their boundary behaviour is apriori known.
