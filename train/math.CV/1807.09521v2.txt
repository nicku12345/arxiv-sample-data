We apply a notion of geodesics of plurisubharmonic functions to interpolation of compact subsets of C^n. Namely, two non-pluripolar, polynomially closed, compact subsets of C^n are interpolated as level sets L_t=\{z: u_t(z)=-1\} for the geodesic u_t between their relative extremal functions with respect to any ambient bounded domain. The sets L_t are described in terms of certain holomorphic hulls. In the toric case, it is shown that the relative Monge-Amp\`ere capacities of L_t satisfy a dual Brunn-Minkowski inequality.
