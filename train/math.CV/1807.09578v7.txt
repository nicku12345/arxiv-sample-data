It is studied the Hilbert boundary value problem for the nondegenerate Beltrami equations in domains D of the complex plane \mathbb C with the so--called quasihyperbolic boundary condition. It is proved the existence of solutions of this problem with coefficients of countably bounded variation and with arbitrary boundary data that are measurable with respect to logarithmic capacity. It is shown that the dimension of the spaces of such solutions is infinite. It is also given applications to the Dirichlet, Neumann and Poincare boundary value problems for analogs of the Laplace equation in anisotropic and inhomogeneous media.
