We introduce a general multisummability theory of formal power series in Carleman ultraholomorphic classes. The finitely many levels of summation are determined by pairwise comparable, nonequivalent weight sequences admitting nonzero proximate orders and whose growth indices are distinct. Thus, we extend the powerful multisummability theory for finitely many Gevrey levels, developed by J.-P. Ramis, J. \'Ecalle and W. Balser, among others. We provide both the analytical and cohomological approaches, and obtain a reconstruction formula for the multisum of a multisummable series by means of iterated generalized Laplace-like operators.
