It is shown that if A is a unital commutative Banach algebra with a dense set of invertible elements, then the maximal ideal space of A contains no compact, locally connected, simply coconnected subspace of topological dimension \geq 2. As a consequence, the existence of a compact set in {\mathbb C}^2 with a nontrivial polynomial hull that contains no topological discs is obtained. This strengthens the celebrated result of Stolzenberg from 1963 that there exists a nontrivial polynomial hull that contains no analytic discs, and it answers a question stated in the literature 10 years ago by Dales and Feinstein but considered much earlier.
