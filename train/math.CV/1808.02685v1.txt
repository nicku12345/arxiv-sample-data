In this article the notion of ultradifferentiable CR manifold is introduced and an ultradifferentiable regularity result for finitely nondegenerate CR mappings is proven. Here ultradifferentiable means with respect to Denjoy-Carleman classes defined by weight sequences. Furthermore the regularity of infinitesimal CR automorphisms on ultradifferentiable abstract CR manifolds is investigated.
