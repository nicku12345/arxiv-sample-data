For a Hermitian holomorphic vector bundle over a Hermitian manifold, we consider the Dolbeault Laplacian with \overline\partial-Neumann boundary conditions, which is a self-adjoint operator on the space of square-integrable differential forms with values in the given holomorphic bundle. We argue that some known results on the spectral properties of this operator on pseudoconvex domains in \mathbb C^n continue to hold on K\"ahler manifolds satisfying certain bounded geometry assumptions. In particular, we will consider the Dolbeault complex for forms with values in a line bundle, where known results from magnetic Schr\"odinger operator theory can be applied.
