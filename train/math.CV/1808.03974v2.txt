In the present paper, we investigate non-homeomorphic mappings of Riemannian surfaces of Sobolev class. We have obtained some estimates of distortion of moduli of families of curves. We have proved that, under some conditions, these mappings have a continuous extension to a boundary of a domain in terms of prime ends.
