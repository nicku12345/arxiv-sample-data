We study the Fourier series of circle homeomorphisms and circle embeddings, with the emphasis on Blaschke product approximation and the vanishing of Fourier coefficients. The analytic properties of the Fourier series are related to the geometry of the circle embeddings, and have implications for the curvature of minimal surfaces.
