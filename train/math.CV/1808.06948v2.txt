We show that Property (P) of \partial\Omega, compactness of the \bar{\partial}-Neumann operators N_1, and compactness of Hankel operator on a smooth bounded pseudoconvex Hartogs domain \Omega={\{(z, w_1, w_2,\dots, w_n) \in \mathbb{C}^{n+1} \mid\sum_{k=1}^{n} |w_k|^2 < e^{-2\varphi(z)}, z\in\mathit{D}\}} are equivalent, where D is a smooth bounded connected open set in \mathbb{C}.
