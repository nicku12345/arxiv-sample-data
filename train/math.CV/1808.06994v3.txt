We construct a counterexample to a well-known extension theorem for slice regular functions, which motivates us to develop a theory of Riemann slice-domains by introducing a new topology on quaternions. By some paths describing axial symmetry in Riemann slice-domains, we rectify the classical extension formula in the theory of slice regular functions and prove a representation formula over slice-domains of regularity. This proof involves an intertwining relation between imaginary units of quaternions and a fixed matrix corresponding to a complex structure.
