This paper investigates the zero distribution of a sequence of polynomials \left\{ P_{m}(z)\right\} _{m=0}^{\infty} generated by the reciprocal of 1+ct+B(z)t^{2}+A(z)t^{3} where c\in\mathbb{R} and A(z), B(z) are real linear polynomials. We study necessary and sufficient conditions for the reality of the zeros of P_{m}(z). Under these conditions, we find an explicit interval containing these zeros, whose union forms a dense subset of this interval.
