We establish the existence of Nevanlinna domains with large boundaries. In particular, these domains can have boundaries of positive planar measure. The sets of accessible points can be of any Hausdorff dimension between 1 and 2. As a quantitative counterpart of these results, we construct rational functions univalent in the unit disc with extremely long boundaries for a given amount of poles.
