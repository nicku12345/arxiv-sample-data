We prove that if f:\mathbb{B}^n \to \mathbb{B}^n, for n\geq 2, is a homeomorphism with bounded skew over all equilateral hyperbolic triangles, then f is in fact quasiconformal. Conversely, we show that if f:\mathbb{B}^n \to \mathbb{B}^n is quasiconformal then f is \eta-quasisymmetric in the hyperbolic metric, where \eta depends only on n and K. We obtain the same result for hyperbolic n-manifolds. Analogous results in \mathbb{R}^n, and metric spaces that behave like \mathbb{R}^n, are known, but as far as we are aware, these are the first such results in the hyperbolic setting, which is the natural metric to use on \mathbb{B}^n.
