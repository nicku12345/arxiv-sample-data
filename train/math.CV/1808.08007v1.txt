To study the analog of Suita's conjecture for domains D \subset \mathbb{C}^n, n \ge 2, B\l ocki introduced the invariant F^k_D(z)=K_D(z)\lambda\big(I^k_D(z)\big), where K_D(z) is the Bergman kernel of D along the diagonal and \lambda\big(I^k_D(z)\big) is the Lebesgue measure of the Kobayashi indicatrix at the point z. In this note, we study the behaviour of F^k_D(z) (and other similar invariants using different metrics) on strongly pseudconvex domains and also compute its limiting behaviour explicitly at certain points of decoupled egg domains in \mathbb{C}^2.
