The main purpose of this paper is to introduce and investigate a class of generalized Bernoulli polynomials and Euler polynomials based on the generating function. we unify all forms of q-exponential functions by one more parameter. we study some conditions on this parameter to related this to some classical results for q-Bernoulli numbers and polynomials.
