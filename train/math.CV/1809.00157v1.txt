The object of this paper is to study the powered Bohr radius \rho_p, p \in (1,2), of analytic functions f(z)=\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} a_kz^k and such that |f(z)|<1 defined on the unit disk |z|<1. More precisely, if M_p^f (r)=\sum_{k=0}^\infty |a_k|^p r^k, then we show that M_p^f (r)\leq 1 for r \leq r_p where r_\rho is the powered Bohr radius for conformal automorphisms of the unit disk. This answers the open problem posed by Djakov and Ramanujan in 2000. A couple of other consequences of our approach is also stated, including an asymptotically sharp form of one of the results of Djakov and Ramanujan. In addition, we consider a similar problem for sense-preserving harmonic mappings in |z|<1. Finally, we conclude by stating the Bohr radius for the class of Bieberbach-Eilenberg functions.
