We study a family of harmonic univalent functions in the open unit disc defined by using post quantum calculus operators. We first obtained a coefficient characterization of these functions. Using this, coefficients estimates, distortion and covering theorems were also obtained. The extreme points of the family and a radius result were also obtained. The results obtained include several known results as special cases.
