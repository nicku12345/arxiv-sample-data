Let \psi be a plurisubharmonic function on the closed unit ball and K_{t\psi}(z) the Bergman kernel on the unit ball with respect to the weight t\psi. We show that the boundary behavior of K_{t\psi}(z) is determined by certain directional Lelong number of \psi for all t smaller than the John-Nirenberg exponent of \psi associated to certain family of nonisotropic balls, which is always positive.
