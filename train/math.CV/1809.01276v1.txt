We solve the Levi-flat Plateau problem in the following case. Let M \subset {\mathbb C}^{n+1}, n \geq 2, be a connected compact real-analytic codimension-two submanifold with only nondegenerate CR singularities. Suppose M is a diffeomorphic image via a real-analytic CR map of a real-analytic hypersurface in {\mathbb C}^n \times {\mathbb R} with only nondegenerate CR singularities. Then there exists a unique compact real-analytic Levi-flat hypersurface, nonsingular except possibly for self-intersections, with boundary M. We also study boundary regularity of CR automorphisms of domains in {\mathbb C}^n \times {\mathbb R}.
