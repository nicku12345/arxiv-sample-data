In this paper, we mainly study the order of q-starlikeness of the well-known basic hypergeometric function. In addition, we obtain the Bieberbach-type problem for a generalized class of starlike functions. We also discuss the Fekete-szeg\"o and the Hankel determinant problems for the same class of functions.
