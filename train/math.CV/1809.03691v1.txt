We classify proper holomorphic mappings between generalized pseudoellipsoids of different dimensions. Those domains are parametrized by the exponents. The relations among them are also obtained. Main tool is the orthogonal decomposition of a CR bundle. Such a decomposition derives the `variable-splitting' of the mapping.
