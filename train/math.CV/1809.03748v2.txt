We construct the tangential k-Cauchy-Fueter complexes on the right quaternionic Heisenberg group, as the quaternionic counterpart of \overline{\partial}_b-complex on the Heisenberg group in the theory of several complex variables. We can use the L^2 estimate to solve the nonhomogeneous tangential k-Cauchy-Fueter equation under the compatibility condition over this group modulo a lattice. This solution has an important vanishing property when the group is higher dimensional. It allows us to prove the Hartogs' extension phenomenon for k-CF functions, which are the quaternionic counterpart of CR functions.
