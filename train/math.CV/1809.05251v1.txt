In this article, a subclass of univalent harmonic mapping is introduced by restricting its analytic part to lie in the class \mathcal{S}^{\delta}[\alpha], 0\leq \alpha < 1, -\infty < \delta < \infty which has been introduced and studied by Kumar \cite{Kumar87} (see also \cite{Mishra95}, \cite{MishraChoudhury95}, \cite{MishraDas96}, \cite{MishraGochhayat06}). Coefficient estimations, growth and distortion properties, area theorem and covering estimates of functions in the newly defined class have been established. Furthermore, we also found bounds for the Bloch's constant for all functions in that family.
