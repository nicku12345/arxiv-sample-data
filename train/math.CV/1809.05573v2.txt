A circle domain \Omega in the Riemann sphere is conformally rigid if every conformal map from \Omega onto another circle domain is the restriction of a M\"{o}bius transformation. We show that circle domains satisfying a certain quasihyperbolic condition, which was considered by Jones and Smirnov, are conformally rigid. In particular, H\"{o}lder circle domains and John circle domains are all conformally rigid. This provides new evidence for a conjecture of He and Schramm relating rigidity and conformal removability.
