Let X be a compact connected CR manifold of dimension 2n+1, n \geq 1. Let \widetilde{X} be a paracompact CR manifold with a transversal CR S^1-action, such that there is a discrete group \Gamma acting freely on \widetilde{X} having X \, = \, \widetilde{X}/\Gamma. Based on an asymptotic formula for the Fourier components of the heat kernel with respect to the S^1-action, we establish the Morse inequalities for Fourier components of reduced L^2-Kohn-Rossi cohomology with values in a rigid CR vector bundle over \widetilde{X}. As a corollary, we obtain the Morse inequalities for Fourier components of Kohn-Rossi cohomology on X which were obtained by Hsiao-Li by using Szeg\"{o} kernel method.
