In the present paper, we derive the third-order differential subordination and superordination results for some analytic univalent functions defined in the unit disc. These results are associated with generalized Struve functions and are obtained by considering suitable classes of admissible functions. As a consequence, the dual problems which yield the sandwich type relations are presented.
