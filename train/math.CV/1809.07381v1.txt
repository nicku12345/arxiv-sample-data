In this article, by making use of the linear operator introduced and studied by Srivastava and Attiya \cite{srivastava1}, suitable classes of admissible functions are investigated and the dual properties of the third-order differential subordinations are presented. As a consequence, various sandwich-type theorems are established for a class of univalent analytic functions involving the celebrated Srivastava-Attiya transform. Relevant connections of the new results are pointed out.
