Our objective in this paper is to introduce and investigate a newly-constructed subclass of normalized analytic and bi-univalent functions by means of the Chebyshev polynomials of the second kind. Upper bounds for the second and third Taylor-Maclaurin coefficients, and also Fekete-Szego inequalities of functions belonging to this subclass are founded. Several connections to some of the earlier known results are also pointed out.
