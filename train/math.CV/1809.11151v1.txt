A nonlinear inverse problem of antiplane elasticity for a multiply connected domain is examined. It is required to determine the profile of n uniformly stressed inclusions when the surrounding infinite body is subjected to antiplane uniform shear at infinity. A method of conformal mappings of circular multiply connected domains is employed. The conformal map is recovered by solving consequently two Riemann-Hilbert problems for piecewise analytic symmetric automorphic functions. For domains associated with the first class Schottky groups a series-form representation of a (3n-4) parametric family of conformal maps solving the problem is discovered. Numerical results for two and three uniformly stressed inclusions are reported and discussed.
