The relationship between interpolation and separation properties of hypersurfaces in Bargmann-Fock spaces over \mathbb{C} ^n is not well-understood except for n=1. We present four examples of smooth affine algebraic hypersurfaces that are not uniformly flat, and show that exactly two of them are interpolating.
