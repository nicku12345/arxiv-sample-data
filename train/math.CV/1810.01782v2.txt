We give conditions in order to approximate locally uniformly holomorphic covering mappings of the unit ball of \mathbb{C}^n with respect to an arbitrary norm, with entire holomorphic covering mappings. The results rely on a generalization of the Loewner theory for covering mappings which we develop in the paper.
