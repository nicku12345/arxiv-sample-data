In this article, by introducing a new method in estimating the counting function of the auxiliary function, we prove a new generalization of uniqueness theorems for meromorphic mappings into \P^n(\C ) which share few hyperplanes regardless of multiplicities. Our result improves the previous result in this topic. Moreover our proof is simpler than the previous proofs.
