Let p:\mathbb{C} \rightarrow \mathbb{C} be a polynomial. The Gauss-Lucas theorem states that its critical points, p'(z) = 0, are contained in the convex hull of its roots. A recent quantitative version Totik shows that if almost all roots are contained in a bounded convex domain K \subset \mathbb{C}, then almost all roots of the derivative p' are in a \varepsilon-neighborhood K_{\varepsilon} (in a precise sense). We prove another quantitative version: if a polynomial p has n roots in K and \lesssim c_{K, \varepsilon} (n/\log{n}) roots outside of K, then p' has at least n-1 roots in K_{\varepsilon}. This establishes, up to a logarithm, a conjecture of the first author: we also discuss an open problem whose solution would imply the full conjecture.
