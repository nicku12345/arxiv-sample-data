For a noncompact complex hyperbolic space form of finite volume X=\mathbb{B}^n/\Gamma, we consider the problem of producing symmetric differentials vanishing at infinity on the Mumford compactification \overline{X} of X similar to the case of producing cusp forms on hyperbolic Riemann surfaces. We introduce a natural geometric measurement which measures the size of the infinity \overline{X}-X called `canonical radius' of a cusp of \Gamma. The main result in the article is that there is a constant r^*=r^*(n) depending only on the dimension, so that if the canonical radii of all cusps of \Gamma are larger than r^*, then there exist symmetric differentials of \overline{X} vanishing at infinity. As a corollary, we show that the cotangent bundle T_{\overline{X}} is ample modulo the infinity if moreover the injectivity radius in the interior of \overline{X} is larger than some constant d^*=d^*(n) which depends only on the dimension.
