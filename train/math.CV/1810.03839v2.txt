In this paper we study class \mathcal{S}^+ of univalent functions f such that \frac{z}{f(z)} has real and positive coefficients. For such functions we give estimates of the Fekete-Szeg\H{o} functional and sharp estimates of their initial coefficients and logarithmic coefficients. Also, we present necessary and sufficient conditions for f\in \mathcal{S}^+ to be starlike of order 1/2.
