The M\"obius invariant space \mathcal{Q}_p, 0<p<\infty, consists of functions f which are analytic in the open unit disk \mathbb{D} with  \|f\|_{\mathcal{Q}_p}=|f(0)|+\sup_{w\in \D} \left(\int_\D |f'(z)|^2(1-|\sigma_w(z)|^2)^p dA(z)\right)^{1/2}<\infty,  where \sigma_w(z)=(w-z)/(1-\overline{w}z) and dA is the area measure on \mathbb{D}. It is known that the following inequality  |f(0)|+\sup_{w\in \D} \left(\int_\D \left|\frac{f(z)-f(w)}{1-\overline{w}z}\right|^2 (1-|\sigma_w(z)|^2)^p dA(z)\right)^{1/2} \lesssim \|f\|_{\mathcal{Q}_p}  played a key role to characterize multipliers and certain Carleson measures for \mathcal{Q}_p spaces. The converse of the inequality above is a conjectured-inequality in [14]. In this paper, we show that this conjectured-inequality is true for p>1 and it does not hold for 0<p\leq 1.
