We construct quasiconformal mappings f\colon \mathbb{R}^{3} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{3} for which there is a Borel set E \subset \mathbb{R}^2 \times \{0\} of positive Lebesgue 2-measure whose image f(E) has Hausdorff 2-measure zero. This gives a solution to the open problem of inverse absolute continuity of quasiconformal mappings on hypersurfaces, attributed to Gehring. By implication, our result also answers questions of V\"ais\"al\"a and Astala--Bonk--Heinonen.
