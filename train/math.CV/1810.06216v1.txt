Recently, in their pioneering work on the subject of bi-univalent functions, Srivastava et al. \cite{HMS-AKM-PG} actually revived the study of the coefficient problems involving bi-univalent functions. Inspired by the pioneering work of Srivastava et al. \cite{HMS-AKM-PG}, there has been triggering interest to study the coefficient problems for the different subclasses of bi-univalent functions. Motivated largely by Ali et al. \cite{Ali-Ravi-Ma-Mina-class}, Srivastava et al. \cite{HMS-AKM-PG} and G\"{u}ney et al. \cite{HOG-GMS-JS-Fib-2018} in this paper, we consider certain classes of bi-univalent functions related to shell-like curves connected with Fibonacci numbers to obtain the estimates of second, third Taylor-Maclaurin coefficients and Fekete - Szeg\"{o} inequalities. Further, certain special cases are also indicated. Some interesting remarks of the results presented here are also discussed.
