In the present paper, we were mainly concerned with obtaining estimates for the general Taylor-Maclaurin coefficients for functions in a certain general subclass of analytic bi-univalent functions. For this purpose, we used the Faber polynomial expansions. Several connections to some of the earlier known results are also pointed out.
