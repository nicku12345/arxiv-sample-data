In this paper we relate some classical normal forms for complex elliptic curves in terms of 4-point sets in the Riemann sphere. Our main result is an alternative proof that every elliptic curve is isomorphic as a Riemann surface to one in the Hesse normal form. In this setting, we give an alternative proof of the equivalence between the Edwards and the Jacobi normal forms. Also, we give a geometric construction of the cross ratios for 4-point sets in general position.
