Let \S be a commutative semigroup with identity e and let \Gamma be a compact subset in the pointwise convergence topology of the space \S' of all non-zero multiplicative functions on \S. Given a continuous function F: \Gamma \to \mathbb C and a complex regular Borel measure \mu on \Gamma such that \mu(\Gamma) \not = 0. It is shown that  \mu(\Gamma) \int_{\Gamma} \varrho(s) \overline{\varrho(t)} |F|^2(\varrho) d\mu(\varrho) = \int_{\Gamma} \varrho(s) F(\varrho) d\mu(\varrho) \int_{\Gamma} \overline{\varrho(t) F(\varrho)} d\mu(\varrho)  for all (s, t) \in \S\times \S if and only if for some \gamma \in \Gamma,  the support of   \mu is contained is contained in \{ F = 0 \} \cup \{\gamma\}. Several applications of this characterization are derived. In particular, the reduction of our theorem to the semigroup of non-negative integers (\mathbb N_{0}, +) solves a problem posed by El Fallah, Klaja, Kellay, Mashregui and Ransford in a more general context.   More consequences of our results are given, some of them illustrate the probabilistic flavor behind the problem studied herein and others establish extremal properties of analytic kernels.
