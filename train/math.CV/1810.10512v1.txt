We characterise in this work the q-plurisubharmonic functions in terms of the theory of viscosity solutions. We show that an upper semicontinuous function is q-plurisubharmonic if and only if its complex Hessian has at most q strictly negative eigenvalues in the viscosity sense. This characterisation is then used to prove that the supremum convolution of a (strictly) q-plurisubharmonic function is again (strictly) q-plurisubharmonic on a maybe different set of definition. Finally, we use the supremum convolution to deduce a new characterisation for the q-pseudoconvex subsets in \mathbb{C}^n.
