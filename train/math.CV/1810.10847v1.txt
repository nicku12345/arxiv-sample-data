In this paper, we define a class of slice mappings of several Clifford variables, and the corresponding slice regular mappings. Furthermore, we establish the growth theorem for slice regular starlike or convex mappings on the unit ball of several slice Clifford variables, as well as on the bounded slice domain which is slice starlike and slice circular.
