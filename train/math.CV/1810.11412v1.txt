We give a possible extension for shears and overshears in the case of two non commutative (quaternionic) variables in relation with the associated vector fields and flows. We present a possible definition of volume preserving automorphisms, even though there is no quaternionic volume form on \mathbb{H}^2 . Using this, we determine a class of quaternionic automorphisms for which the Ander- sen-Lempert theory applies. Finally, we exhibit an example of a quaternionic automor- phism, which is not in the in the closure of the set of finite compositions of volume preserving quaternionic shears.
