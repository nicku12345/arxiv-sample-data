We discuss the notion of an inner function for spaces of analytic functions in multiply connected domains in \mathbb{C}, giving a historical overview and comparing several possible definitions. We explore connections between inner functions, zero-divisors for Hardy spaces and Bergman spaces, and weighted reproducing kernels. After recording some obstructions and negative results, we suggest avenues for further research and point out several open problems.
