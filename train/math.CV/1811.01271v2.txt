Let \mathcal{S}^*_t(\alpha_1,\alpha_2) denote the class of functions f analytic in the open unit disc \Delta, normalized by the condition f(0)=0=f'(0)-1 and satisfying the following two--sided inequality: \begin{equation*}   -\frac{\pi\alpha_1}{2}< \arg\left\{\frac{zf'(z)}{f(z)}\right\}   <\frac{\pi\alpha_2}{2} \quad (z\in\Delta), \end{equation*} where 0<\alpha_1,\alpha_2\leq1. The class \mathcal{S}^*_t(\alpha_1,\alpha_2) is a subclass of strongly starlike functions of order \beta where \beta=\max\{\alpha_1,\alpha_2\}. The object of the present paper is to derive some certain inequalities including (for example), upper and lower bounds for {\rm Re}\{zf'(z)/f(z)\}, growth theorem, logarithmic coefficient estimates and coefficient estimates for functions f belonging to the class \mathcal{S}^*_t(\alpha_1,\alpha_2).
