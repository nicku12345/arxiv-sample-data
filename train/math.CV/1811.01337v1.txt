Let M be a subharmonic function with Riesz measure \nu_M in a domain D in the n-dimensional complex Euclidean space \mathbb C^n, and let f be a nonzero function that is holomorphic in D, vanishes on a set {\sf Z}\subset D, and satisfies |f| \leq \exp M on D. Then restrictions on the growth of \nu_M near the boundary of D imply certain restrictions on the area/volume of \sf Z. We give a quantitative study of this phenomenon in the subharmonic framework.
