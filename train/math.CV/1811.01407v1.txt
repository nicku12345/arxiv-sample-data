Let D be a nonempty domain in \mathbb C^n. We give a scale of necessary conditions for the distribution of the zero set of holomorphic function f on domain D\subset {\mathbb C}^n under a restriction on its growth |f|\leq \exp M, where M\not\equiv -\infty is a subharmonic function. If n=1, D\neq \mathbb C is simply connected, and M is continuous, then this conditions are sufficient.
