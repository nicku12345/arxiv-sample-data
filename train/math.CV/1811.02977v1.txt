We generalize the inequality being a counterpart of the several complex variables version of the Suita conjecture. For this aim higher order generalizations of the Bergman kernel are introduced. As a corollary some new partial results on the dimension of the Bergman space in pseudoconvex domains are given. A relation between the problem of Wiegerinck on possible dimension of the Bergman space of unbounded pseudoconvex domains in general case and in the case of balanced domains is also shown. Moreover, some classes of domains where the answer to the problem of Wiegerinck is positive are given. Additionally, regularity properties of functions involving the volumes of Azukawa indicatrices are shown.
