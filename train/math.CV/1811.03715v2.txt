We prove a modified form of the classical Morrey-Kohn-H\"ormander identity, adapted to pseudoconcave boundaries. Applying this result to an annulus between two bounded pseudoconvex domains in \mathbb{C}^n, where the inner domain has   \mathcal{C}^{1,1} boundary, we show that the L^2 Dolbeault cohomology group in bidegree (p,q) vanishes if 1\leq q\leq n-2 and is Hausdorff and infinite-dimensional if q=n-1, so that the Cauchy-Riemann operator has closed range in each bidegree. As a dual result, we prove that the Cauchy-Riemann operator is solvable in the L^2 Sobolev space W^1 on any pseudoconvex domain with \mathcal{C}^{1,1} boundary. We also generalize our results to annuli between domains which are weakly q-convex in the sense of Ho for appropriate values of q.
