Let E be a closed subset of the unit circle of measure zero. Recently, Beise and M\"uller showed the existence of a function in the Hardy space H^2 for which the partial sums of its Taylor series approximate any continuous function on E. In this paper, we establish an analogue of this result in a non-linear setting where we consider optimal polynomial approximants of reciprocals of functions in H^2 instead of Taylor polynomials. The proof uses a new result on simultaneous zero-free approximation of independent interest. Our results extend to Dirichlet-type spaces \mathcal{D}_\alpha for \alpha \in [0,1].
