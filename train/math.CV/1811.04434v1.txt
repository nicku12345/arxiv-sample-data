We prove the corona theorem for domains whose boundary lies in certain smooth quasicircles. These curves, which are not necessarily Dini-smooth, are defined by quasiconformal mappings whose complex dilatation verifies certain conditions. Most importantly we do not assume any "thickness" condition on the boundary domain. In this sense, our results complement those obtained by Garnett and Jones (1985) and C. Moore on C^{1+\alpha} curves (1987).
