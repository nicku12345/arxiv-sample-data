We characterize the Carleson measures for the Dirichlet space on the bidisc, hence also its multiplier space. Following Maz'ya and Stegenga, the characterization is given in terms of a capacitary condition. We develop the foundations of a bi-parameter potential theory on the bidisc and prove a Strong Capacitary Inequality. In order to do so, we have to overcome the obstacle that the Maximum Principle fails in the bi-parameter theory.
