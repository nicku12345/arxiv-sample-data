In this paper, we find the necessary and sufficient conditions, inclusion relations for Poisson distribution series \mathcal{K}(m,z)=z+\sum_{n=2}^\infty \frac{m^{n-1}}{(n-1)!}e^{-m}z^{n} belonging to the subclasses \mathcal{S}(k,\lambda ) and \mathcal{C}(k,\lambda ) of analytic functions with negative coefficients. Further, we consider the integral operator \mathcal{G}(m,z) = \int_0^z \frac{\mathcal{F}(m,\zeta)}{\zeta} d\zeta belonging to the above classes.
