Let n \geq 3 and \Omega be a bounded domain in \mathbb{C}^n with a smooth negative plurisubharmonic exhaustion function \varphi. As a generalization of Y. Tiba's result, we prove that any holomorphic function on a connected open neighborhood of the support of (i\partial \bar \partial \varphi )^{n-2} in \Omega can be extended to the whole domain \Omega. To prove it, we combine an L^2 version of Serre duality and Donnelly-Fefferman type estimates on (n,n-1)- and (n,n)- forms.
