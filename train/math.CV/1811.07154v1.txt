We consider the subharmonicity property of the logarithm of Azukawa pseudometrics of pseudoconvex domains under pseudoconvex variations. We prove that such a property holds for the variation of balanced domains. We also give a non-balanced example. The relation of the volume of Azukawa indicatrix and the estimate in the Ohsawa-Takegoshi L^2-extension theorem is also discussed.
