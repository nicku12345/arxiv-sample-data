The paper presents some recent results on the BMO Teichm\"uller space, its subspaces and quotient spaces. We first consider the chord-arc curve subspace and prove that every element of the BMO Teichm\"uller space is represented by its finite composition. Moreover, we show that these BMO Teichm\"uller spaces have affine foliated structures induced by the VMO Teichm\"uller space. By which, their quotient spaces have natural complex structures modeled on the quotient Banach space. Then, a complete translation-invariant metric is introduced on the BMO Teichm\"uller space and is shown to be a continuous Finsler metric in a special case.
