In the present paper, we study a new subclass \mathcal{M}_p(\alpha,\beta) of p--valent functions and obtain some inequalities concerning the coefficients for the desired class. Also, by use of the Hadamard product, we define a general operator and find a condition such that it belongs to the class \mathcal{M}_p(\alpha,\beta).
