We expand the classical balayage of measures and subharmonic functions on a system of rays S with a common origin on the complex plane \mathbb C. This allows for an arbitrary subharmonic function v of finite order on \mathbb C build \delta-subharmonic function on \mathbb C, harmonic outside S coinciding with v on S outside the polar set, of the same order of growth as v. We give applications to the relationship of the growth of an entire function in S with the distribution of its zeros.
