Let M\/ be a subharmonic function with Riesz measure \mu_M on the unit disk \mathbb D in the complex plane \mathbb C. Let f be a nonzero holomorphic function on \mathbb D such that f vanishes on {\sf Z}\subset \mathbb D, and satisfies |f| \leq \exp M on \mathbb D. Then restrictions on the growth of \mu_M near the boundary of D imply certain restrictions on the distribution of \sf Z. We give a quantitative study of this phenomenon in terms of special non-radial test functions constructed using \rho-trigonometrically convex functions.
