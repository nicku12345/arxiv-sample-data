Let f be a nonzero holomorphic function in the unit ball \mathbb B of the n-dimensional complex Euclidean space \mathbb C^n such that the function f vanishes on the set {\sf Z}\subset \mathbb B and satisfies the constraint |f|\leq \exp M on \mathbb B, where M\not\equiv \pm \infty is \delta-subharmonic function on \mathbb B with Riesz charge \mu_M. We give a scale of integral uniform constraints from above on the distribution of the set {\sf Z} via the charge \nu_M in terms of (2n-2)-Hausdorff measure of the set \sf Z, as well as test convex radial functions and \rho-subspherical functions on the unit sphere \mathbb S \subset \mathbb C^n, which at n=1 can be interpreted as 2\pi-periodic \rho-trigonometrically convex functions on the real axis \mathbb R \subset \mathbb C.
