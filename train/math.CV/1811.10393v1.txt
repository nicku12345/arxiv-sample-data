Let D be a domain in the complex plane \mathbb C. It follows from first part of our work that if a non-zero holomorphic function f on D vanishes on a sequence {\sf Z}\subset D and satisfies |f|\leq M on D, where M is a subharmonic function on D, then the the distribution of {\sf Z} is subordinated to the Riesz measure \nu_M of M in a certain sense. Here we show that this result is "almost reversible".
