Let R be a compact Riemann surface and \Gamma be a Jordan curve separating R into connected components \Sigma_1 and \Sigma_2. We consider Calder\'on-Zygmund type operators T(\Sigma_1,\Sigma_k) taking the space of L^2 anti-holomorphic one-forms on \Sigma_1 to the space of L^2 holomorphic one-forms on \Sigma_k, which we call the Schiffer operators. We extend results of Menahem M. Schiffer and others, which where confined to analytic Jordan curves \Gamma, to general quasicircles in a characterizing manner, and prove new identities for adjoints of the Schiffer operators. Furthermore, we show that if V is the space of anti-holomorphic one-forms orthogonal to L^2 forms on R with respect to the inner product on \Sigma_1, then the Schiffer operator T(\Sigma_1,\Sigma_2) is an isomorphism onto the set of exact one-forms on \Sigma_2.   Using the relation between the Schiffer operator and a Cauchy-type integral involving Green's function, we also derive a jump decomposition (on arbitrary Riemann surfaces) for quasicircles and initial data which are boundary values of Dirichlet-bounded harmonic functions and satisfy the classical algebraic constraints. In particular we show that the jump operator is an isomorphism on the subspace determined by these constraints.
