Let U be a bounded open subset of the complex plane. Let 0<\alpha<1 and let A_{\alpha}(U) denote the space of functions that satisfy a Lipschitz condition with exponent \alpha on the complex plane, are analytic on U and are such that for each \epsilon >0, there exists \delta >0 such that for all z, w \in U, |f(z)-f(w)| \leq \epsilon |z-w|^{\alpha} whenever |z-w| < \delta. We show that if a boundary point x_0 for U admits a bounded point derivation for A_{\alpha}(U) and U has an interior cone at x_0 then one can evaluate the bounded point derivation by taking a limit of a difference quotient over a non-tangential ray to x_0. Notably our proofs are constructive in the sense that they make explicit use of the Cauchy integral formula.
