We prove an analogue of the classical Bernstein polynomial inequality on a compact subset E of the real line. The Lipschitz continuity of the Green function for the complement of E with respect to the extended complex plane and the differentiability at a point of E of a special, associated with E, conformal mapping of the upper half-plane onto the comb domain play crucial role in our investigation.
