We use properties of the sequences of zeros of certain spaces of analytic functions in the unit disc \mathbb D to study the question of characterizing the weighted superposition operators which map one of these spaces into another. We also prove that for a large class of Banach spaces of analytic functions in \mathbb D, Y, we have that if the superposition operator S_\varphi  associated to the entire function \varphi  is a bounded operator from X, a certain Banach space of analytic functions in \mathbb D, into Y, then the superposition operator S_{\varphi ^\prime } maps X into Y.
