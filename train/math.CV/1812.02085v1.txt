Let \mathbb X and \mathbb Y be \ell-connected Jordan domains, \ell \in \mathbb N, with rectifiable boundaries in the complex plane. We prove that any boundary homeomorphism \varphi \colon \partial \mathbb X \to \partial \mathbb Y admits a Sobolev homeomorphic extension h \colon \overline{\mathbb X} \to \overline{\mathbb Y} in W^{1,1} (\mathbb X, \mathbb C). If instead \mathbb X has s-hyperbolic growth with s>p-1, we show the existence of such an extension lies in the Sobolev class W^{1,p} (\mathbb X, \mathbb C) for p\in (1,2). Our examples show that the assumptions of rectifiable boundary and hyperbolic growth cannot be relaxed. We also consider the existence of W^{1,2}-homeomorphic extensions subject to a given boundary data.
