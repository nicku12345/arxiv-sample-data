The main purpose of this paper is to prove some density results of polynomials in Fock spaces of slice regular functions. The spaces can be of two different kinds since they are equipped with different inner products and contain different functions. We treat both the cases, providing several results, some of them based on constructive methods which make use of the Taylor expansion and of the convolution polynomials. We also prove quantitative estimates in terms of higher order moduli of smoothness and in terms of the best approximation quantities.
