For a domain D \subset \mathbb C^n, n \ge 2, let F^k_D(z)=K_D(z)\lambda\big(I^k_D(z)\big), where K_D(z) is the Bergman kernel of D along the diagonal and \lambda\big(I^k_D(z)\big) is the Lebesgue measure of the Kobayashi indicatrix at the point z. This biholomorphic invariant was introduced by B\locki and in this note, we study its limiting boundary behaviour on two classes of domains namely, h-extendible and strongly pseudoconvex polyhedral domains.
