Octonionic analysis is becoming eminent due to the role of octonions in the theory of G2 manifold. In this article, a new slice theory is introduced as a generalization of the holomorphic theory of several complex variables to the noncommutative or nonassociative realm. The Bochner-Martinelli formula is established for slice functions of several octonionic variables as well as several quaternionic variables. In this setting, we find the Hartogs phenomena for slice regular functions
