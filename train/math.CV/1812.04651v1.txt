The modulus metric (also called the capacity metric) on a domain D\subset \mathbb{R}^n can be defined as \mu_D(x,y)=\inf\{{\mbox{cap}}\,(D,\gamma)\}, where {\mbox{cap}}\,(D,\gamma) stands for the capacity of the condenser (D,\gamma) and the infimum is taken over all continua \gamma\subset D containing the points x and y. It was conjectured by J. Ferrand, G. Martin and M. Vuorinen in 1991 that every isometry in the modulus metric is a conformal mapping. In this note, we confirm this conjecture and prove new geometric properties of surfaces that are spheres in the metric space (D,\mu_D).
