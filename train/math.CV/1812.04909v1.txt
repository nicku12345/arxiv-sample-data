For a harmonic map \mathcal{F}:\mathcal{Z} {\buildrel {\,harm\,} \over\longrightarrow} \mathcal{W} transforming the contour of a corner of the boundary \partial\mathcal{Z} into a rectilinear segment of the boundary \partial\mathcal{W}, the behavior near the vertex of the specified corner is investigated. The behavior of the inverse map \mathcal{F}^{-1}:\mathcal{W} \longrightarrow \mathcal{Z} near the preimage of the vertex is investigated as well. In particular, we prove that if \varphi is the value of the exit angle from the vertex of the reentrant corner for a smooth curve \mathcal{L} and \theta is the value of the exit angle from the vertex image for the image \mathcal{F} (\mathcal{L}) of the specified curve, then the dependence of \theta on \varphi is described by a discontinuous function.Thus, such a behavior of the harmonic map qualitatively differs from the behavior of the corresponding conformal map: for the latter one, the dependence \theta (\varphi) is described by a linear function.
