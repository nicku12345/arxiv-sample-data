In this paper we study the class \mathcal{U} of functions that are analytic in the open unit disk {\mathbb D}=\{z:|z|<1\}, normalized such that f(0)=f'(0)-1=0 and satisfy \[\left|\left [\frac{z}{f(z)} \right]^{2}f'(z)-1 \right|<1\quad\quad (z\in {\mathbb D}).\] For functions in the class \mathcal{U} we give sharp estimate of the second ant the third Hankel determinant, its relationship with the class of \alpha-convex functions, as well as certain starlike properties.
