This paper establishes the necessary and sufficient conditions for the reality of all the zeros in a polynomial sequence \{P_i\}_{i=1}^{\infty} generated by a three-term recurrence relation P_i(x)+ Q_1(x)P_{i-1}(x) +Q_2(x) P_{i-2}(x)=0 with the standard initial conditions P_{0}(x)=1, P_{-1}(x)=0, where Q_1(x) and Q_2(x) are arbitrary real polynomials.
