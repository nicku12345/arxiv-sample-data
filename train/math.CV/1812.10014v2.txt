This paper establishes a version of Nevanlinna theory based on Jackson difference operator D_{q}f(z)=\frac{f(qz)-f(z)}{qz-z} for meromorphic functions of zero order in the complex plane \mathbb{C}. We give the logarithmic difference lemma, the second fundamental theorem, the defect relation, Picard theorem and five-value theorem in sense of Jackson q-difference operator. By using this theory, we investigate the growth of entire solutions of linear Jackson q-difference equations D^{k}_{q}f(z)+A(z)f(z)=0 with meromorphic coefficient A, where D^k_q is Jackson k-th order difference operator, and estimate the logarithmic order of some q-special functions.
