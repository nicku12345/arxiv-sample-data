In this paper, it is aimed to determine the radii of starlikeness and convexity of the normalized generalized Struve functions for three different kinds of normalization and to find tight lower and upper bounds for the radius of starlikeness and convexity of these normalized Struve functions by making use of Euler-Rayleigh inequalities. The Laguerre-P\'olya class of entire functions has a crucial role in constructing our main results.
