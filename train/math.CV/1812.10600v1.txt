A generalized Fock-Bargmann-Hartogs domain D_n^{\mathbf{m},\mathbf{p}} is defined as a domain fibered over \mathbb{C}^{n} with the fiber over z\in \mathbb{C}^{n} being a generalized complex ellipsoid \Sigma_z({\mathbf{m},\mathbf{p}}). In general, a generalized Fock-Bargmann-Hartogs domain is an unbounded non-hyperbolic domains without smooth boundary. The main contribution of this paper is as follows. By using the explicit formula of Bergman kernels of the generalized Fock-Bargmann-Hartogs domains, we obtain the rigidity results of proper holomorphic mappings between two equidimensional generalized Fock-Bargmann-Hartogs domains. We therefore exhibit an example of unbounded weakly pseudoconvex domains on which the rigidity results of proper holomorphic mappings can be built.
