We study in detail the one-variable local theory of functions holomorphic over a finite-dimensional commutative associative unital \mathbb{C}-algebra \mathcal{A}, showing that it shares a multitude of features with the classical one-variable Complex Analysis, including the validity of the Jacobian conjecture for \mathcal{A}-holomorphic regular maps and a generalized Homological Cauchy's Integral Formula. In fact, in doing so we replace \mathcal{A} by a morphism \varphi: \mathcal{A} \to \mathcal{B} in the category of finite-dimensional commutative associative unital \mathbb{C}-algebras in a natural manner, paving a way to establishing an appropriate category of Funktionentheorien (ger. function theories). We also treat the very instructive case of non-unital finite-dimensional commutative associative \mathbb{R}-algebras as far as it serves above agenda.
