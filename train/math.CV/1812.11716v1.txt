Let D be a proper domain in the extended complex plane {\mathbb C}_{\infty}:={\mathbb C}\cup \{\infty\}, M=M_+-M_-\not\equiv \pm \infty be a difference of non-trivial subharmonic functions M_{\pm}\not\equiv \mp \infty on D, \text{Hol}(D,M) be the class of holomorphic function f on D satisfying |f|\leq \text{const}_f\exp M om D, {\sf Z}\subset D be a sequence of points in D without limits points in D. We give a complete description of the conditions under which the sequence \sf Z is a sequence of all zeros for some nonzero function f\in \text{Hol}(D,M).
