Given a free resolution of an ideal \mathfrak a of holomorpic functions there is an associated residue current R that coincides with the classical Coleff-Herrera product if \mathfrak a is a complete intersection ideal and whose annihilator ideal equals \mathfrak a. In the case when \mathfrak a is an Artinian monomial ideal, we show that the singularities of R are small in a certain sense if and only if \mathfrak a is integrally closed.
