The purpose of this paper is to give a better understanding of complex points up to quadratic terms of real codimension 2 submanifolds embedded in a complex 3-manifold. We answer the question how a normal form of a pair of one arbitrary and one symmetric 2\times 2 matrix with respect to a certain linear group action changes under arbitrarily small perturbations. This result is then applied to describe the quadratic part of normal forms of complex points of small \mathcal{C}^{2}-perturbations of real 4-manifolds embedded in a complex 3-manifold.
