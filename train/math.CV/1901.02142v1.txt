Let f be the infinitesimal generator of a one-parameter semigroup \left\{ F_{t}\right\} _{t\ge0} of holomorphic self-mappings of the open unit disk \Delta. In this paper we study properties of the family R of resolvents (I+rf)^{-1}:\Delta\to\Delta~ (r\ge0) in the spirit of geometric function theory. We discovered, in particular, that R forms an inverse L\"owner chain of hyperbolically convex functions. Moreover, each element of R satisfies the Noshiro-Warschawski condition and is a starlike function of order at least \frac12,. This, in turn, implies that each element of R is also a holomorphic generator. We mention also quasiconformal extension of an element of R. Finally we study the existence of repelling fixed points of this family.
