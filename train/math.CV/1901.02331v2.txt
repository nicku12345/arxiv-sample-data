Given holomorphic functions \psi_0 and \psi_1, we consider first-order differential operators acting on Hardy space, generated by the formal differential expression E(\psi_0,\psi_1)f(z)=\psi_0(z)f(z)+\psi_1(z)f'(z). We characterize these operators which are complex symmetric with respect to weighted composition conjugations. In parallel, as a basis of comparison, a characterization for differential operators which are hermitian is carried out. Especially, it is shown that hermitian differential operators are contained properly in the class of \calC-selfadjoint differential operators. The calculation of the point spectrum of some of these operators is performed in detail.
