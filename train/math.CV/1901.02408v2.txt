Let \Omega denote the class of functions f analytic in the open unit disc \Delta, normalized by the condition f(0)=f'(0)-1=0 and satisfying the inequality \begin{equation*}   \left|zf'(z)-f(z)\right|<\frac{1}{2}\quad(z\in\Delta). \end{equation*} The class \Omega was introduced recently by Peng and Zhong (Acta Math Sci {\bf37B(1)}:69--78, 2017). Also let \mathcal{U} denote the class of functions f analytic and normalized in \Delta and satisfying the condition \begin{equation*}   \left|\left(\frac{z}{f(z)}\right)^2f'(z)-1\right|<1\quad(z\in\Delta). \end{equation*} In this article, we obtain some further results for the class \Omega including, an extremal function and more examples of \Omega, inclusion relation between \Omega and \mathcal{U}, the radius of starlikeness, convexity and close--to--convexity and sufficient condition for function f to be in \Omega. Furthermore, along with the settlement of the coefficient problem and the Fekete--Szeg\"{o} problem for the elements of \Omega, the Toeplitz matrices for \Omega are also discussed in this article.
