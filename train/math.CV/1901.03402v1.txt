We survey recent work and announce new results concerning two singular integral operators whose kernels are holomorphic functions of the output variable, specifically the Cauchy-Leray integral and the Cauchy-Szeg\H o projection associated to various classes of bounded domains in \mathbb C^n with n\geq 2.
