In this paper our aim is to investigate the radii of \eta-uniformly convexity, \alpha-convexity, \eta-parabolic starlikeness and strong starlikeness of order \rho of the generalized Mittag-Leffler function for three different kinds of normalization by using their Hadamard factorization in such a way that the resulting functions are analytic. The basic tool of this study is the Mittag-Leffler function in series. Also we have shown that the obtained radii are the smallest positive roots of some functional equations.
