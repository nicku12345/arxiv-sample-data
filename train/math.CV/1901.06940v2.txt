Let 1\le p<\infty, 0<q<\infty and \nu be a two-sided doubling weight satisfying   \sup_{0\le r<1}\frac{(1-r)^q}{\int_r^1\nu(t)\,dt}\int_0^r\frac{\nu(s)}{(1-s)^q}\,ds<\infty. The weighted Besov space \mathcal{B}_{\nu}^{p,q} consists of those f\in H^p such that   \int_0^1 \left(\int_{0}^{2\pi} |f'(re^{i\theta})|^p\,d\theta\right)^{q/p}\nu(r)\,dr<\infty. Our main result gives a characterization for f\in \mathcal{B}_{\nu}^{p,q} depending only on |f|, p, q and \nu. As a consequence of the main result and inner-outer factorization, we obtain several interesting by-products. In particular, we show the following modification of a classical factorization by F. and R. Nevanlinna: If f\in \mathcal{B}_{\nu}^{p,q}, then there exist f_1,f_2\in \mathcal{B}_{\nu}^{p,q} \cap H^\infty such that f=f_1/f_2. In addition, we give a sufficient and necessary condition guaranteeing that the product of f\in H^p and an inner function belongs to \mathcal{B}_{\nu}^{p,q}. Applying this result, we make some observations on zero sets of \mathcal{B}_{\nu}^{p,p}.
