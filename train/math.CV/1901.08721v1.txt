A well known result due to Carlson affirms that a power series with finite and positive radius of convergence R has no Ostrowski gaps if and only if the sequence of zeros of its nth sections is asymptotically equidistributed to {|z|=R}. Here we extend this characterization to those power series with null radius of convergence, modulo some necessary normalizations of the sequence of the sections of f.
