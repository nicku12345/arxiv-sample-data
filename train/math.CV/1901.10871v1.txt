The purpose of the present paper is to introduce a new subclasses of the function class of bi-univalent functions defined in the open unit disc. Furthermore, we obtain estimates on the coefficients |a_{2}| and |a_{3}| for functions of this class. Some results related to this work will be briefly indicated.
