Let T be a positive closed current of bidegree (1,1) on a multiprojective space X={\mathbb P}^{n_1}\times\ldots\times{\mathbb P}^{n_k}. For certain values of \alpha, which depend on the cohomology class of T, we show that the set of points of X where the Lelong numbers of T exceed \alpha have certain geometric properties. We also describe the currents T that have the largest possible Lelong number in a given cohomology class, and the set of points where this number is assumed.
