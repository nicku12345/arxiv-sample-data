In 1998 the physicist Andre Trautman conjectured that a three-dimensional CR manifold is locally realizable if and only if its canonical bundle admits a closed nowhere zero section. We review the relevant definitions, give the physical context, and outline an earlier result which established a weak version of the Conjecture.
