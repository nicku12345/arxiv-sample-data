We prove that a function, which is defined on a union of lines \mathbb{C} E through the origin in \mathbb{C}^n with direction vectors in E\subset \mathbb{C}^n and is holomorphic of fixed finite order and finite type along each line, extends to an entire holomorphic function on \mathbb{C}^n of the same order and finite type, provided that E has positive homogeneous capacity in the sense of Siciak and all directional derivatives along the lines satisfy a necessary compatibility condition at the origin. We are able to estimate the indicator function of the extension in terms of Siciak's weighted homogeneous extremal function, where the weight is a function of the type of the given function on each given line. As an application we prove a generalization of Helgason's support theorem by showing how the support of a continuous function with rapid decrease at infinity can be located from partial information on the support of its Radon transform.
