The Schur (resp. Carath\'eodory) class consists of all the analytic functions f on the unit disk with |f|\le 1 (resp. \Re f>0 and f(0)=1). The Schur parameters \gamma_0,\gamma_1,\dots (|\gamma_j|\le 1) are known to parametrize the coefficients of functions in the Schur class. By employing a recursive formula for it, we describe the n-th coefficient of a Carath\'eodory function in terms of n independent variables \gamma_1,\dots, \gamma_n with |\gamma_j|\le 1. The mapping properties of those correspondences are also studied.
