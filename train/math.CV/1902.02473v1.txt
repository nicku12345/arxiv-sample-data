Given a domain \Omega in the complex plane \mathbb{C} and a univalent function q defined in an open unit disk \mathbb{D} with nice boundary behaviour, Miller and Mocanu studied the class of admissible functions \Psi(\Omega,q) so that the differential subordination \psi(p(z),zp(z),z^2p''(z);z)\prec h(z) implies p(z)\prec q(z) where p is an analytic function in \mathbb{D} with p(0)=1, \psi:\mathbb{C}^3\times \mathbb{D}\to\mathbb{C} and \Omega=h(\mathbb{D}). This paper investigates the properties of this class for q(z)=e^z. As application, several sufficient conditions for normalized analytic functions f to be in the subclass of starlike functions associated with the exponential function are obtained.
