We study the \bar \partial -equation first in Stein manifold then in complete K\"ahler manifolds. The aim is to get L^{r} and Sobolev estimates on solutions with compact support.   In the Stein case we get that for any (p,q)-form \omega  in L^{r} with compact support and \bar \partial -closed there is a (p,q-1)-form u in W^{1,r} with compact support and such that \bar \partial u=\omega .   In the case of K\"ahler manifold, we prove and use estimates on solutions on Poisson equation with compact support and the link with \bar \partial  equation is done by a classical theorem stating that the Hodge laplacian is twice the \bar \partial  (or Kohn) Laplacian in a K\"ahler manifold.   This uses and improves, in special cases, our result on Andreotti-Grauert type theorem.
