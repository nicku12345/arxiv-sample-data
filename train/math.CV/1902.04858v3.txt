The evaluation formula for an elliptic beta integral of type G_2 is proved. The integral is expressed by a product of Ruijsenaars' elliptic gamma functions, and the formula includes that of Gustafson's q-beta integral of type G_2 as a special limiting case as p\to 0. The elliptic beta integral of type BC_1 by van Diejen and Spiridonov is effectively used in the proof of the evaluation formula.
