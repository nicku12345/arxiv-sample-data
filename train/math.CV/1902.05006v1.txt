In this paper, we study primeness and pseudo primeness of p-adic meromorphic functions. We also consider left (resp. right ) primeness of these functions. We give, in particular, sufficient conditions for a meromorphic function to satisfy such properties. Finally, we consider the problem of permutability of entire functions.
