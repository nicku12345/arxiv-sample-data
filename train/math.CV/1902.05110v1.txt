We show that the Monge-Amp\`ere density of the extremal function V_P for a non-convex Pac-Man set P\subset {\bf R}^2 tends to a finite limit as we approach the vertex p of P linearly but with a value that may vary with the line. On the other hand, along a tangential approach to p the Monge-Amp\`ere density becomes unbounded. This partially mimics the behavior of the Monge-Amp\`ere density of the union of two quarter disks set S of Sigurdsson and Snaebjarnarson. We also recover their formula for V_S by elementary methods.
