In most classical holomorphic function spaces on the unit disk in which the polynomials are dense, a function f can be approximated in norm by its dilates f_r(z):=f(rz)~(r<1), in other words, \lim_{r\to1^-}\|f_r-f\|=0. We construct a de Branges-Rovnyak space {\mathcal H}(b) in which the polynomials are dense, and a function f\in{\mathcal H}(b) such that \lim_{r\to1^-}\|f_r\|_{{\mathcal H}(b)}=\infty. The essential feature of our construction lies in the fact that b is an outer function.
