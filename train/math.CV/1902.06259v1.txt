By considering a certain univalent function in the open unit disk U, that maps U onto a strip domain, we introduce a new class of analytic and close-to-convex functions by means of a certain non-homogeneous Cauchy-Euler-type differential equation. We determine the coefficient bounds for functions in this new class. Relevant connections of some of the results obtained with those in earlier works are also provided.
