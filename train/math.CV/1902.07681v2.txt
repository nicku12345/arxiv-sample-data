Let \Omega\subset \mathbb{C}^n for n\geq 2 be a bounded pseudoconvex domain with a C^2-smooth boundary. We study the compactness of composition operators on the Bergman spaces of smoothly bounded convex domains. We give a partial characterization of compactness of the composition operator (with sufficient regularity of the symbol) in terms of the behavior of the Jacobian on the boundary. We then construct a counterexample to show the converse of the theorem is false.
