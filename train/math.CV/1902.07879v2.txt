As an analogue of the Hadamard quotient problem in number theory, the quotient problem (in the sense of complex entire functions) for two sequences F(n)=a_0+a_1f_1^n+\cdots+a_lf_l^n and  G(n)=b_0+b_1g_1^n+\cdots+b_mg_m^n, has been solved, where the f_i and g_j are nonconstant entire functions and a_i and b_j are non-zero constants except that a_0 can be zero. In this paper, we consider the generalization of this problem in which we allow a_i and b_j to be small growth entire functions with respect to (g_1, \cdots, g_m) by modifying the second main theorem with moving targets to a truncated version. We also compare our result to a special case in exponential polynomials first studied by Ritt.
