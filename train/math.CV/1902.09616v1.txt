The class M^p (1<p<\infty) consists of all holomorphic functions f on the open unit disk \Bbb D for which  \int_0^{2\pi}\left(\log^+Mf(\theta)\right)^p\,\frac{d\theta}{2\pi}<\infty,  where Mf(\theta)=\sup_{0\leqslant r<1}\big\lvert f\big(re^{i\theta}\big)\big \rvert. The class M^p equipped with the topology given by the metric \rho_p defined by  \rho_p(f,g)=\left(\int_0^{2\pi}\log^p(1+M(f-g)(\theta))\, \frac{d\theta}{2\pi}\right)^{1/p}\quad (f,g\in M^p)  becomes an F-algebra. In this paper, we consider the ideal structure of the classes M^p (1<p<\infty). Our main result gives a complete characterization of prime ideals in M^p which are not dense subsets of M^p. As a consequence, we obtaiin a related Mochizuki's result concerning the Privalov classes N^p (1<p<\infty).
