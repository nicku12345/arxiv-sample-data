We establish a determinant formula for the bilinear form associated with the elliptic hypergeometric integrals of type BC_n by studying the structure of q-difference equations to be satisfied by them. The determinant formula is proved by combining the q-difference equations of the determinant and its asymptotic analysis along the singularities. The elliptic interpolation functions of type BC_n are essentially used in the study of the q-difference equations.
