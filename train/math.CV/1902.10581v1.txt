We prove equality of the vector field (iterated commutator) type and the regular contact type, which together with the Bloom theorem on equality of the Levi-form type and the regular contact type provides a complete solution of a long standing open problem of Bloom in the case of complex dimension three. For general dimensions, we verify the Bloom conjecture when s=n-2, which provides the first positive result in the pseudoconvexity sensitive case for a real hypersurface in {\mathbb{C}}^n after his important work in 1981.
