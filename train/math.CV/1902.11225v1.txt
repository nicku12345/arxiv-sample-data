In this paper, we first prove relation between analytic and co-analytic part of the class harmonic univalent functions S_H(S):={f = h+\overline g|h is element of S} by means of second dilatation is constant. Next, we verify the coefficient conjecture of Clunie and Sheil-Small for class of harmonic univalent functions. Finally, we obtain distortion bounds of this class.
