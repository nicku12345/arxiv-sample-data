In the second part of this work was developed a technique of balayage of finite genus q=0,1,2,\dots for measures (charges) and (\delta-) subharmonic functions of finite order to an arbitrary closed system of rays S with vertex at origin on the complex plane \mathbb C. In this third part of our work, we use only the case q=1 when S is a pair of oppositely directed rays, i.e., S is a straight line as the point set, and balayage is made from both sides of this line. We consider measures and subharmonic functions of finite type of order 1. This bilateral balayage of genus 1 will be applied to the non-triviality of weight classes of entire functions of exponential type E that allocated only constraint on their growth along the line; for the full description of subsequences of zeros for classes E; the existence of entire functions-multipliers of h for entire functions of exponential type g, limiting by the multiplication of their growth as fh\in E; the possibility of the representation of meromorphic functions in the form of a ratio of functions from E. The origins of the study lies in the classical Malliavin-Rubel Theorem on the conditions of existence of an entire function of exponential type vanishing on a given sequence of positive numbers. These studies also are parallel to the famous Beurling-Malliavin Theorems on the multiplier and on the radius of completeness.
