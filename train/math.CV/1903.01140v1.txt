Suppose that \langle f_n \rangle is a sequence of polynomials, \langle f_n^{(k)}(0)\rangle converges for every non-negative integer k, and that the limit is not 0 for some k. It is shown that if all the zeros of f_1, f_2, \dots lie in the closed upper half plane \rm{Im}\ z\geq 0, or if f_1, f_2, \dots are real polynomials and the numbers of their non-real zeros are uniformly bounded, then the sequence converges uniformly on compact sets in the complex plane. The results imply a theorem of Benz and a conjecture of P\'olya.
