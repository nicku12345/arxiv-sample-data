Let n\ge 2 be an integer and assume that \mathbb{A}=\{x\in\mathbf{R}^n:1<|x|<R\} and \A_\ast = \{y \in \mathbf{R}^n: 1 < |y| < R_\ast\} be two annuli in Euclidean space \mathbf{R}^n. Assume that \mathcal{F}(\A, \A_\ast) (resp. \mathcal{R}(\A, \A_\ast)) be the class of all orientation preserving (resp. radial) homeomorphisms h : \A \mapsto \A_\ast in the Sobolev space \mathcal{W} ^{1,n}(\A, \A_\ast) which keep the boundary circles in the same order. In this paper, we extended the corresponding results of Iwaniec and Onninen which was published in {\it Math. Ann.} Vol. 348, 2010.
