An approach to complex interpolation of compact subsets of \Bbb C^n, including Brunn-Minkowski type inequalities for the capacities of the interpolating sets, was developed recently by means of plurisubharmonic geodesics between relative extremal functions of the given sets. Here we show that a much better control can be achieved by means of the geodesics between weighted relative extremal functions. In particular, we establish convexity properties of the capacities that are stronger than those given by the Brunn-Minkowski inequalities.
