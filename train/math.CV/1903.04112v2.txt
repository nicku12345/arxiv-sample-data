By using a variant Property (P_q) of Catlin, we discuss the relation of small set of weakly pseudoconvex points on the boundary of pseudoconvex domain and compactness of the \overline{\partial}-Neumann operator. In particular, we show that if the Hausdorff (2n-2)-dimensional measure of the weakly pseudoconvex points on the boundary of a smooth bounded pseudoconvex domain is zero, then the \overline{\partial}-Neumann operator N_{n-1} is compact on (0,n-1)-level L^2-integrable forms.
