Let M\subset \mathbb C^n be a real analytic hypersurface, M'\subset \mathbb C^N (N\geq n) be a strongly pseudoconvex real algebraic hypersurface of the special form and F be a meromorphic mapping in a neighborhood of a point p\in M which is holomorphic in one side of M. Assuming some additional conditions for the mapping F on the hypersurface M, we proved that F has a holomorphic extension to p. This result may be used to show the regularity of CR mappings between real hypersurfaces of different dimensions.
