In this short note, we collect some results regarding the Remmert reduction of holomorphically convex space and its application to a variation of the usual union problem. Classically, the union problem asks the following question: is a complex space, which is an increasing union of Stein subspaces X_1\Subset X_2\Subset\cdots, a Stein space itself? The variation we are interested in is the following: is a complex space, which is an increasing union of holomorphically convex subspaces X_1\Subset X_2\Subset\cdots, holomorphically convex itself? The results presented here are close analogues of (some of) those alredy present in the literature for the Stein case; our aim is only to collect such material for reference, as we consider it well known.
