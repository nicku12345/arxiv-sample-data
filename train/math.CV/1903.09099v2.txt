We study the geometry of the scale invariant Cassinian metric and prove sharp comparison inequalities between this metric and the hyperbolic metric in the case when the domain is either the unit ball or the upper half space. We also prove sharp distortion inequalities for the scale invariant Cassinian metric under M\"obius transformations.
