Major controversy surrounds the use of Elliptic Curves in finite fields as Random Number Generators. There is little information however concerning the "randomness" of different procedures on Elliptic Curves defined over fields of characteristic 0. The aim of this paper is to investigate the behaviour of the sequence \psi_m=[m]P and then generalize to polynomial seuences of the form \phi_m=[p(m)]P. We examine the behaviour of this sequence in different domains and attempt to realize for which points it is not equidistributed in \mathbb{C}/\Lambda. We will first study the sequence in the space of Elliptic Curves E(\mathbb{C}) defined over the complex numbers and then reconsider our approach to tackle real valued Elliptic Curves. In the process we obtain the measure with respect to which the sequence \psi is equidistributed in E(\mathbb{R}). In Section 4 we prove that every sequence of points P_n=(x_n,y_n,1) equidistributed w.r.t. that measure is not equidistributed\mod(1) with the obvious map x_n\to\{x_n\}.
