We consider the family of all analytic and univalent functions in the unit disk of the form f(z)=z+a_2z^2+a_3z^3+\cdots. Our objective in this paper is to estimate the difference of the moduli of successive coefficients, that is \big | |a_{n+1}|-|a_n|\big |, for f belonging to the family of \gamma-spirallike functions of order \alpha. Our particular results include the case of starlike and convex functions of order \alpha   and other related class of functions.
