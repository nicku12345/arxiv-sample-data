Let f be a transcendental meromorphic function defined in the complex plane \mathbb{C}, and \varphi(\not\equiv 0,\infty) be a small function of f. In this paper, We give a quantitative estimation of the characteristic function T(r, f) in terms of N\left(r,\frac{1}{M[f]-\varphi(z)}\right) as well as \ol{N}\left(r,\frac{1}{M[f]-\varphi(z)}\right), where M[f] is the differential monomial, generated by f.\par Moreover, we prove one normality criterion: Let \mathscr{F} be a family of analytic functions on a domain D and let k(\geq1), q_{0}(\geq 3), q_{i}(\geq0) (i=1,2,\ldots,k-1), q_{k}(\geq1) be positive integers. If for each f\in \mathscr{F}, f has only zeros of multiplicity at least k, and f^{q_{0}}(f')^{q_{1}}...(f^{(k)})^{q_{k}}\not=1, then \mathscr{F} is normal on domain D.
