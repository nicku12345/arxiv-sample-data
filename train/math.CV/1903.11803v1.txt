In this article we prove Bohr inequalities for sense-preserving K-quasiconformal harmonic mappings defined in \mathbb{D} and obtain the corresponding results for sense-preserving harmonic mappings by letting K\to\infty. One of the results includes the sharpened version of a theorem by Kayumov \textit{et. al.} (\textit{Math. Nachr.}, 291 (2018), no. 11--12, 1757--1768). In addition Bohr inequalities have been established for uniformly locally univalent holomorphic functions, and for \log(f(z)/z) where f is univalent or inverse of a univalent function.
