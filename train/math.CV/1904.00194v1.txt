Theory of differential subordination provides techniques to reduce differential subordination problems into verifying some simple algebraic condition called admissibility condition. We exploit the first order differential subordination theory to get several sufficient conditions for function satisfying several differential subordinations to be a Janowski function with positive real part. As applications, we obtain sufficient conditions for normalized analytic functions to be Janowski starlike functions.
