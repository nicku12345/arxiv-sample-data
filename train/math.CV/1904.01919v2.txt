In this paper we are concerned with two classes of conformally invariant spaces of analytic functions in the unit disc \D, the Besov spaces B^p (1\le p<\infty ) and the Q_s spaces (0<s<\infty ). Our main objective is to characterize for a given pair (X, Y) of spaces in these classes, the space of pointwise multipliers M(X, Y), as well as to study the related questions of obtaining characterizations of those g analytic in \D  such that the Volterra operator T_g or the companion operator I_g with symbol g is a bounded operator from X into Y.
