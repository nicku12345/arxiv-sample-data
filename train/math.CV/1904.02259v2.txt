In this paper, we deal with the growth of solutions of homogeneous linear complex differential equation by using the concept of lower [\textit{p,q}]-order and lower [\textit{p,q}]-type in a sector of the unit disc instead of the whole unit disc, and we obtain similar results as in the case of the unit disc.
