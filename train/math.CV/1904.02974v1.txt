We show that in a scale of weighted Dirichlet spaces D_{\alpha}, including the Bergman space, given any finite Blaschke product B there exists an equivalent norm in D_{\alpha} such that B satisfies the wandering subspace property with respect to such norm. This extends, in some sense, previous results by Carswell, Duren and Stessin. As a particular instance, when B(z)=z^k and |\alpha| \leq \frac{\log (2)}{\log(k+1)}, the chosen norm is the usual one in D_\alpha.
