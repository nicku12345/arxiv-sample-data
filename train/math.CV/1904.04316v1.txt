The parqueting-reflection principle is shown to also work for constructing harmonic Green functions and harmonic Neumann functions for a class of domains, which are bounded by two arcs in \mathbb{C} with a special intersecting angle \pi/n, n\in\mathbb{N}^*. Applying the Green representation formula and the Neumann representation formula we solve the Dirichlet and Neumann boundary problem to the Poisson equation in these domains.
