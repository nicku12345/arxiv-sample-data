We consider a family M_t^3, with t>1, of real hypersurfaces in a complex affine 3-dimensional quadric arising in connection with the classification of homogeneous compact simply-connected real-analytic hypersurfaces in {\mathbb C}^n due to Morimoto and Nagano. To finalize their classification, one needs to resolve the problem of the CR-embeddability of M_t^3 in {\mathbb C}^3. In our earlier article we showed that M_t^3 is CR-embeddable in {\mathbb C}^3 for all 1<t<\sqrt{(2+\sqrt{2})/3}. In the present paper we prove that M_t^3 can be immersed in {\mathbf C}^3 for every t>1 by means of a polynomial map. In addition, one of the immersions that we construct helps simplify the proof of the above CR-embeddability theorem and extend it to the larger parameter range 1<t<\sqrt{5}/2.
