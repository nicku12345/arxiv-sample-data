The purpose of this note is to use the scaling principle to study the boundary behaviour of some conformal invariants on planar domains. The focus is on the Aumann--Carath\'{e}odory rigidity constant, the higher order curvatures of the Carath\'{e}odory metric and two conformal metrics that have been recently defined.
