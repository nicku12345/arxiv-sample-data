By using Rafid operator we define the subclass R_{\mu,p}^\delta(\alpha;A,B) and P_{\mu,p}^\delta(\alpha; A,B) of analytic and p-valent functions with negative coefficients we investigate some sharp results including coefficients estimates, distortion theorem, radii of starlikeness, convexity, close-to-convexity, and modified-Hadamard product. Finally, we give an application of fractional calculus and Bernadi-Libora-Livingstion operator.
