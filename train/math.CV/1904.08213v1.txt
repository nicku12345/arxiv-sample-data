We consider the problem of minimizing the weighted Dirichlet energy between homeomorphisms of planar annuli. A known challenge lies in the case when the weight \lambda depends on the independent variable z. We prove that for an increasing radial weight \lambda(z) the infimal energy within the class of all Sobolev homeomorphisms is the same as in the class of radially symmetric maps. For a general radial weight \lambda(z) we establish the same result in the case when the target is conformally thin compared to the domain. Fixing the admissible homeomorphisms on the outer boundary we establish the radial symmetry for every such weight.
