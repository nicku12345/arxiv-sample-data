In this paper, we define the subclasses R_{\mu,p}^{\delta}(\alpha;A,B)\  and  P_{\mu,p}^{\delta}(\alpha;A,B)\  of analytic functions in the open unit disc of complex plain. Then the neighborhood properties, integral means inequalities and some results concerning the partial sums of the functions belonging to these two subclasses are discussed.
