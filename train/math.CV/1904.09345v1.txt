The L^2 theory of the \bar\partial operator on domains in \mathbb{C}^n is predicated on establishing a good basic estimate. Typically, one proves not a single basic estimate but a family of basic estimates that we call a family of strong closed range estimates. Using this family of estimates on (0,q)-forms as our starting point, we establish necessary geometric and potential theoretic conditions.   The paper concludes with several applications. We investigate the consequences for compactness estimates for the \bar\partial-Neumann problem, and we also establish a generalization of Kohn's weighted theory via elliptic regularization. Since our domains are not necessarily pseudoconvex, we must take extra care with the regularization.
