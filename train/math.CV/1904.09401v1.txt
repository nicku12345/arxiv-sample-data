Solution operators for the equation \bar \partial u=f are constructed on general product domains in \mathbb{C}^n. When the factors are one-dimensional, the operator is a simple integral operator: it involves specific derivatives of f integrated against iterated Cauchy kernels. For higher dimensional factors, the solution is constructed by solving sub-\bar \partial equations with modified data on the factors. Estimates of the operators in several norms are proved.
