We make sharp estimates to obtain a Schwarz type lemma for the symmetrized polydisc \gn and for the extended symmetrized polydisc \Gn. We explicitly construct an interpolating function under certain condition. To do so, we followed the methods described in \cite{Young-LMS}. Also we find a few geometric interplay between the members of the family \Gn and its closure \widetilde{\Gamma}_n.
