We consider inductive limits of weighted spaces of holomorphic functions in the unit ball of \mathbb C^n. The relationship between sets of uniqueness, weakly sufficient sets and sampling sets in these spaces is studied. In particular, the equivalence of these sets, under general conditions of the weights, is obtained.
