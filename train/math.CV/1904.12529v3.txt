We discuss random interpolation in weighted Dirichlet spaces \mathcal{D}_\alpha, 0\leq \alpha\leq 1. While conditions for deterministic interpolation in these spaces depend on capacities which are very hard to estimate in general, we show that random interpolation is driven by surprisingly simple distribution conditions. As a consequence, we obtain a breakpoint at \alpha=1/2 in the behavior of these random interpolating sequences showing more precisely that almost sure interpolating sequences for \mathcal{D}_\alpha are exactly the almost sure separated sequences when 0\le \alpha<1/2 (which includes the Hardy space H^2=\mathcal{D}_0), and they are exactly the almost sure zero sequences for \mathcal{D}_\alpha when 1/2 \leq \alpha\le 1 (which includes the classical Dirichlet space \mathcal{D}=\mathcal{D}_1).
