We prove that for a pseudoconvex domain of the form \mathfrak{A} = \{(z, w) \in \mathbb C^2 : v > F(z, u)\}, where w = u + iv and F is a continuous function on {\mathbb C}_z \times {\mathbb R}_u, the following conditions are equivalent:   (1) The domain \mathfrak{A} is Kobayashi hyperbolic.   (2) The domain \mathfrak{A} is Brody hyperbolic.   (3) The domain \mathfrak{A} possesses a Bergman metric.   (4) The domain \mathfrak{A} possesses a bounded smooth strictly plurisubharmonic function, i.e. the core \mathfrak{c}(\mathfrak{A}) of \mathfrak{A} is empty.   (5) The graph \Gamma(F) of F can not be represented as a foliation by holomorphic curves of a very special form, namely, as a foliation by translations of the graph \Gamma({\mathcal H}) of just one entire function {\mathcal H} : {\mathbb C}_z \to {\mathbb C}_w.
