Let {\mathcal M} be the class of analytic functions in the unit disk \ID with the normalization f(0)=f'(0)-1=0, and satisfying the condition \left |z^2\left (\frac{z}{f(z)}\right )''+ f'(z)\left(\frac{z}{f(z)} \right)^{2}-1\right |\leq 1, \quad z\in \ID.  Functions in \mathcal{M} are known to be univalent in \ID. In this paper, it is shown that the harmonic mean of two functions in {\mathcal M} are closed, that is, it belongs again to {\mathcal M}. This result also holds for other related classes of normalized univalent functions. A number of new examples of functions in \mathcal{M} are shown to be starlike in \ID. However we conjecture that functions in \mathcal{M} are not necessarily starlike, as apparently supported by other examples.
