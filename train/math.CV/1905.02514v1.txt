The most important uniform algebra is the family of continuous functions on a compact subset K of the complex plane \mathbb{C} which are analytic on the interior int(K) For compact sets K which are regular (i.e. K =int(K) and for polyanalytic functions, we introduce analogous spaces, which are Banach spaces with respect to the sup-norm, but are not closed with respect to the usual pointwise multiplication. We shall introduce a multiplication on these spaces and investigate the resulting algebras.
