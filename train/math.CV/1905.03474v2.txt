Let X be a compact connected CR manifold with a transversal CR S^1-action of dimension 2n-1, which is only assumed to be weakly pseudoconvex. Let \Box_b be the \overline{\partial}_b-Laplacian. Eigenvalue estimate of \Box_b is a fundamental issue both in CR geometry and analysis. In this paper, we are able to obtain a sharp estimate of the number of eigenvalues smaller than or equal to \lambda of \Box_b acting on the m-th Fourier components of smooth (n-1,q)-forms on X, where m\in \mathbb{Z}_+ and q=0,1,\cdots, n-1. Here the sharp means the growth order with respect to m is sharp. In particular, when \lambda=0, we obtain the asymptotic estimate of the growth for m-th Fourier components H^{n-1,q}_{b,m}(X) of H^{n-1,q}_b(X) as m \rightarrow +\infty. Furthermore, we establish a Serre type duality theorem for Fourier components of Kohn-Rossi cohomology which is of independent interest. As a byproduct, the asymptotic growth of the dimensions of the Fourier components H^{0,q}_{b,-m}(X) for  m\in \mathbb{Z}_+ is established. Compared with previous results in this field, the estimate for \lambda=0 already improves very much the corresponding estimate of Hsiao and Li . We also give appilcations of our main results, including Morse type inequalities, asymptotic Riemann-Roch type theorem, Grauert-Riemenscheider type criterion, and an orbifold version of our main results which answers an open problem.
