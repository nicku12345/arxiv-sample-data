We give a proof of the well-known fact that the \Ok-module \E of smooth functions is flat by means of residue theory and integral formulas. A variant of the proof gives a related statement for classes of functions of lower regularity. We also prove a Brian\c{c}on-Skoda type theorem for ideals of the form \E a, where a is an ideal in \Ok.
