Ma-Minda class (of starlike functions) consists of all normalized analytic functions f on the unit disk for which the image of zf'(z)/f(z) is contained in the some starlike region in the right-half plane. We obtain the best possible bounds on the second and third coefficient for the inverse functions of functions in the Ma-Minda class. The bounds on the Fekete-Szeg\"o functional and the second Hankel determinant of the inverse functions of the functions belonging to the Ma-Minda class are also determined. Further, the bounds on the first five coefficients of the inverse functions are investigated for two particular subclasses of the Ma-Minda class. In addition, some radius estimates associated with the two subclasses are also computed.
