Orders and types of entire and meromorphic functions have been actively investigated by many authors. In the present paper, we aim at investigating some basic properties in connection with sum and product of relative (p,q)-\varphi order, relative (p,q)-\varphi type, and relative (p,q)-\varphi weak type of meromorphic functions with respect to entire functions.
