In this article, we study mappings acting between domains of two factor spaces by certain groups of M\"{o}bius automorphisms of the unit ball that act discontinuously and do not have fixed points. For such mappings, we have established estimates for the distortion of the modulus of families of paths, which are similar to the well-known Poletsky and V\"{a}is\"{a}l\"{a} inequalities. As applications, we have obtained several important results on the local and boundary behavior of mappings.
