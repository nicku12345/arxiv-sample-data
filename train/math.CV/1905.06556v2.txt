The purpose of this paper is to study holomorphic approximation and approximation of \bar\partial-closed forms in complex manifolds of complex dimension n\geq 1. We consider extensions of the classical Runge theorem and the Mergelyan property to domains in complex manifolds for the smooth and the L^2 topology. We characterize the Runge or Mergelyan property in terms of certain Dolbeault cohomology groups and some geometric sufficient conditions are given.
