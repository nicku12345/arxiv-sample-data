In this paper, we obtain the Fekete-Szeg\"{o} problem for the k-th (k\geq1) root transform of the analytic and normalized functions f satisfying the condition \begin{equation*} 1+\frac{\alpha-\pi}{2 \sin \alpha}< {\rm Re}\left\{\frac{zf'(z)}{f(z)}\right\} < 1+\frac{\alpha}{2\sin \alpha} \quad (|z|<1), \end{equation*} where \pi/2\leq \alpha<\pi. Afterwards, by the above two-sided inequality we introduce and investigate a certain subclass of analytic and bi-univalent functions in the disk |z|<1 and obtain upper bounds for the first few coefficients and Fekete-Szeg\"{o} problem for functions belonging to this analytic and bi-univalent function class.
