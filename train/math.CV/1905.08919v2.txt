An exponential polynomial of order q is an entire function of the form      f(z)=P_1(z)e^{Q_1(z)}+\cdots +P_k(z)e^{Q_k(z)},    where the coefficients P_j(z),Q_j(z) are polynomials in z such that      \max\{\deg{Q_j}\}=q.    In 1977 Steinmetz proved that the zeros of f lying outside of finitely many logarithmic strips around so called critical rays have exponent of convergence \leq q-1. This result does not say nothing about the zero distribution of f in each individual logarithmic strip. Here, it is shown that the asymptotic growth of the non-integrated counting function of zeros of f is asymptotically comparable to r^q in each logarithmic strip. The result generalizes the first order results by P\'olya and Schwengeler from the 1920's, and it shows, among other things, that the critical rays of f are precisely the Borel directions of order q of f. The error terms in the asymptotic equations for T(r,f) and N(r,1/f) originally due to Steinmetz are also improved.
