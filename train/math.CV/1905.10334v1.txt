The present article concerns the Bohr radius for K-quasiconformal sense-preserving harmonic mappings f=h+\overline{g} in the unit disk \mathbb{D} for which the analytic part h is subordinated to some analytic function \varphi, and the purpose is to look into two cases: when \varphi is convex, or a general univalent function in \ID. The results state that if h(z) =\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}a_n z^n and g(z)=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}b_n z^n, then \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}(|a_n|+|b_n|)r^n\leq \dist (\varphi(0),\partial\varphi(\ID)) ~\mbox{ for r\leq r^*}  and give estimates for the largest possible r^* depending only on the geometric property of \varphi (\ID) and the parameter K. Improved versions of the theorems are given for the case when b_1 = 0 and corollaries are drawn for the case when K\rightarrow \infty.
