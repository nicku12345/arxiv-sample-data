In this paper we investigate the range of validity of Ruelle's property. First, we show that every finitely-generated Fuchsian group has Ruelle's property. We also prove the existence of an infinitely-generated Fuchsian group satisfying Ruelle's property. Concerning the negative results we first generalize Astala-Zinsmeister's results by proving that all convergence Fuchsian groups of the first kind fail to have Ruelle's property. At last, we also give some results about the second kind Fuchsian groups.
