Motivated by the recent proof of Newman's conjecture \cite{R-T} we study certain properties of entire caloric functions, namely solutions of the heat equation \partial_t F = \partial_z^2 F which are entire in z and t. As a prerequisite, we establish some general properties of the order and type of an entire function. Then, we start our inquiry on entire caloric functions by determining the necessary and sufficient condition for a function f(z) to be the initial condition of an entire solutions of the heat equation and, subsequently, we examine the relation of the z-order and z-type of an entire caloric function F(t, z), viewed as function of z, to its t-order and t-type respectively, if it is viewed as function of t. After that, we shift our attention to the zeros z_k(t) of an entire caloric function F(t, z), viewed as function of z. We show that the points (t, z) at which F(t, z) = \partial_z F(t, z) = 0 form a discrete set in \mathbb{C}^2 and we derive the t-evolution equations of the zeros of F(t, z). These are differential equations which hold for all but countably many t \in \mathbb{C}.
