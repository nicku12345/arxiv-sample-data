In this paper we continue our study of local rigidity for maps of CR submanifolds of the complex space. We provide a linear sufficient condition for local rigidity of finitely nondegenerate maps between minimal CR manifolds. Furthermore, we show higher order infinitesimal conditions can be used to give a characterization of local rigidity.
