We study the deformation theory of CR maps in the positive codimensional case. In particular, we study structural properties of the {\em mapping locus} E of (germs of nondegenerate) holomorphic maps H \colon (M,p) \to M' between generic real submanifolds M \subset \mathbb C^N and M' \subset \mathbb C^{N'}, defined to be the set of points p' \in M' which admit such a map with H(p) = p'. We show that this set E is semi-analytic and provide examples for which E posseses (prescribed) singularities.
