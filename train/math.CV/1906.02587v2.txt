The reflection map introduced by D'Angelo is applied to deduce simpler descriptions of nondegeneracy conditions for sphere maps and to the study of infinitesimal deformations of sphere maps. It is shown that the dimension of the space of infinitesimal deformations of a nondegenerate sphere map is bounded from above by the explicitly computed dimension of the space of infinitesimal deformations of the homogeneous sphere map. Moreover a characterization of the homogeneous sphere map in terms of infinitesimal deformations is provided.
