We introduce the notion of the algebraic overshear density property which implies both the algebraic notion of flexibility and the holomorphic notion of the density property. We investigate basic consequences of this stronger property, and propose further research directions in this borderland between affine algebraic geometry and elliptic holomorphic geometry.
