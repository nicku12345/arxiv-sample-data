The radii of starlikeness and convexity associated with lemniscate of Bernoulli and the Janowski function, (1+Az)/(1+Bz) for -1\leq B<A\leq 1, have been determined for normalizations of q-Bessel function, Bessel function of first kind of order \nu, Lommel function of first kind and Legendre polynomial of odd degree.
