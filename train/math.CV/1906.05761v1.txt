We establish pointwise growth estimates for the spherical derivative of solutions of the first order algebraic differential equations. A generalization of this result to higher order equations is also given. We discuss the related question of when for a given class X of meromorphic functions in the unit disc, defined by means of the spherical derivative, and m \in \mathbb{N} \setminus \{1\}, f^m\in X implies f\in X. An affirmative answer to this is given for example in the case of \mathord{\rm UBC}, the \alpha-normal functions with \alpha\ge1 and certain (sufficiently large) Dirichlet type classes.
