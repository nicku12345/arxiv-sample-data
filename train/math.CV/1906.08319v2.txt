The main object of this paper is to find necessary and sufficient conditions for generalized Bessel functions of first kind zu_{p}(z) to be in the classes \mathcal{SP}_{p}(\alpha ,\beta ) and \mathcal{UCSP}(\alpha ,\beta ) of uniformly spirallike functions and also give necessary and sufficient conditions for z(2-u_{p}(z)) to be in the above classes. Furthermore, we give necessary and sufficient conditions for \mathcal{I}(\kappa ,c)f \ to be in \mathcal{UCSPT}(\alpha ,\beta ) provided that the function f is in the class \mathcal{R}^{\tau }(A,B). Finally, we give conditions for the integral operator \mathcal{G(}\kappa ,c,z\mathcal{)=}% \int_{0}^{z}(2-u_{p}(t))dt to be in the class \mathcal{UCSPT}(\alpha ,\beta ). Several corollaries and consequences of the main results are also considered.
