Based on Harnack's inequality and convex analysis we show that each plurisubharmonic function is locally BUO (bounded upper oscillation) with respect to polydiscs of finite type but not for arbitrary polydiscs. We also show that each function in the Lelong class is globally BUO with respect to all polydiscs. A dimension-free BUO estimate is obtained for the logarithm of the modulus of a complex polynomial. As an application we obtain an approximation formula for the Bergman kernel that preserves all directional Lelong numbers. For smooth plurisubharmonic functions we derive a new asymptotic identity for the Bergman kernel from Berndtsson's complex Brunn--Minkowski theory, which also yields a slightly better version of the sharp Ohsawa--Takegoshi extension theorem in some special cases.
