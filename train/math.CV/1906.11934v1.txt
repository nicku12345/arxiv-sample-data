Let X be a subset of the complex plane and let A_0(X) denote the space of VMO functions that are analytic on X. A_0(X) is said to admit a bounded point derivation of order t at a point x_0 \in \partial X if there exists a constant C such that |f^{(t)}(x_0)|\leq C ||f||_{BMO} for all functions in VMO(X) that are analytic on X \cup \{x_0\}. In this paper, we give necessary and sufficient conditions in terms of lower 1-dimensional Hausdorff content for A_0(X) to admit a bounded point derivation at x_0. These conditions are similar to conditions for the existence of bounded point derivations on other functions spaces.
