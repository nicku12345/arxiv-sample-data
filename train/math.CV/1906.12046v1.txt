In this paper, we have investigated the uniqueness problems of entire and meromorphic functions concerning differential polynomials sharing a small function. Our results radically extended and improved the results of Bhoosnurmath-Pujari and Harina - Anand not only by sharing small function instead of fixed point but also reducing the lower bound of  n . The authors Harina-Anand made plenty of mistakes in their paper. We have corrected all of them in a more convenient way. At last some open questions have been posed for further study in this direction.
