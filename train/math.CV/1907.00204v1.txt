We generalize a version of Lavrent\'ev's theorem which says that a function that is continuous on a compact set K with connected complement and without interior points can be uniformly approximated as closely as desired by a polynomial without zeros on the set K, so that the polynomial can avoid values from any given countable set. We also prove a corresponding version of Mergelyan's theorem when the interior of K is a finite union of Jordan domains, pairwise separated by a positive distance.
