We derive estimates in a weighted Sobolev space W^{k,p}_{\mu}(D) for a homotopy operator on a bounded strictly pseudoconvex domain D of C^2 boundary in {\C}^n. As a result, we show that given any 2n < p < \infty, k > 1, q \geq 1, and a \dbar-closed (0,q) form \var of class W^{k,p}(D), there exist a solution u to \dbar u = \var such that u \in W^{k,p}_{\yh-\ve}(D) for any \ve > 0. If k=1, then we can take p to be any value between 1 and \infty. In other words, the solution gains almost \yh-derivative in a suitable sense.
