We build in a given pseudoconvex (Runge) domain D of \mathbb{C}^N a \mathcal O(D) convex set \Gamma, every connected component of which is a holomorphically contractible (convex) compact set, enjoying the property that any continuous path \gamma:[0,1)\rightarrow D with \lim _{r\rightarrow 1}\gamma(r)\in \partial D and omitting \Gamma has infinite length. This solves a problem left open in a recent paper by Alarc\'on and Forstneri\v{c}.
