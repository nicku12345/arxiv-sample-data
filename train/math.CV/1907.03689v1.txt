Let \Omega\subset\mathbb{C}^n be a bounded pseudoconvex domain. We define the Diederich-Forn{\ae}ss index with respect to a family of functions to be the supremum over the set of all exponents 0<\eta<1 such that there exists a function \rho_\eta in this family such that -\rho_\eta is comparable to the distance to the boundary of \Omega on \Omega and such that -(-\rho_\eta)^\eta is plurisubharmonic on \Omega. We first prove that computing the Diederich-Forn{\ae}ss index with respect to the family of upper semi-continuous functions is the same as computing the Diederich-Forn{\ae}ss index with respect to the family of Lipschitz functions. When the boundary of \Omega is C^k, k\geq 2, we prove that the Diederich-Forn{\ae}ss index with respect to the family of C^k functions is the same as the Diederich-Forn{\ae}ss index with respect to the family of C^2 functions.
