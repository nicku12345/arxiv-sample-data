Let \Omega be a domain in \mathbb C^n. Suppose that \partial\Omega is smooth pseudoconvex of D'Angelo finite type near a boundary point \xi_0\in \partial\Omega and the Levi form has corank at most 1 at \xi_0. Our goal is to show that if the squeezing function s_\Omega(\eta_j) tends to 1 or the Fridman invariant h_\Omega(\eta_j) tends to 0 for some sequence \{\eta_j\}\subset \Omega converging to \xi_0, then this point must be strongly pseudoconvex.
