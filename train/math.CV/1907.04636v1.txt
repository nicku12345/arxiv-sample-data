In this paper we deal with the radii of starlikeness and convexity of the q-Mittag--Leffler function for three different kinds of normalization by making use of their Hadamard factorization in such a way that the resulting functions are analytic in the unit disk of the complex plane. By applying Euler-Rayleigh inequalities for the first positive zeros of these functions tight lower and upper bounds for the radii of starlikeness of these functions are obtained. The Laguerre-P\'olya class of real entire functions plays a pivotal role in this investigation.
