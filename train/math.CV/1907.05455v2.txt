Given a domain of holomorphy D in \mathbb{C}^N, N\geq 2, we show that the set of holomorphic functions in D whose cluster sets along any finite length paths to the boundary of D is maximal, is residual, densely lineable and spaceable in the space \mathcal{O}(D) of holomorphic functions in D. Besides, if D is a strictly pseudoconvex domain in \mathbb{C}^N, and if a suitable family of smooth curves \gamma(x,r), x\in bD, r\in [0,1), ending at a point of bD is given, then we exhibit a spaceable, densely lineable and residual subset of \mathcal{O}(D), every element f of which satisfies the following property: For any measurable function h on bD, there exists a sequence (r_n)_n \in [0,1) tending to 1, such that   \[   f\circ \gamma(x,r_n) \rightarrow h (x),\,n\rightarrow \infty,   \] for almost every x in bD.
