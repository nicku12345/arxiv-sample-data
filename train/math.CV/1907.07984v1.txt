Supposing that A(z) is an exponential polynomial of the form      A(z)=H_0(z)+H_1(z)e^{\zeta_1z^n}+\cdots +H_m(z)e^{\zeta_mz^n},    where H_j's are entire and of order <n, it is demonstrated that the function H_0(z) and the geometric location of the leading coefficients \zeta_1,\ldots,\zeta_m play a key role in the oscillation of solutions of the differential equation f''+A(z)f=0. The key tools consist of value distribution properties of exponential polynomials, and elementary properties of the Phragm\'en-Lindel\"of indicator function. In addition to results in the whole complex plane, results on sectorial oscillation are proved.
