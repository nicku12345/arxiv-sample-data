We continue the study in the setting of pluripotential theory arising from polynomials associated to a convex body C in ({\bf R}^+)^d. Here we discuss C-Robin functions and their applications. In the particular case where C is a simplex in ({\bf R}^+)^2 with vertices (0,0),(b,0),(a,0), a,b>0, we generalize results of T. Bloom to construct families of polynomials which recover the C-extremal function V_{C,K} of a nonpluripolar compact set K\subset {\bf C}^d.
