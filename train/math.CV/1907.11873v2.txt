Let M be a closed complex submanifold in {\mathbb C}^N with the complete K\"ahler metric induced by the Euclidean metric. Several finiteness theorems on the L^p Bergman space of holomorphic sections of a given Hermitian line bundle L over M and the associated L^2 cohomology groups are obtained. Some infiniteness theorems are also given in order to test the accuracy of finiteness theorems. As applications we obtain some rigidity results concerning growth of curvatures.
