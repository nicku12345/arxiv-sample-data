We study the Oka properties of complements of closed countable sets in \mathbb{C}^{n}\ (n>1) which are not necessarily discrete. Our main result states that every tame closed countable set in \mathbb{C}^{n}\ (n>1) with a discrete derived set has an Oka complement. As an application, we obtain non-elliptic Oka manifolds which negatively answer a long-standing question of Gromov. Moreover, we show that these examples are not even weakly subelliptic. It is also proved that every finite set in a Hopf manifold has an Oka complement and an Oka blowup.
