We study the zero distribution of the sum of the first n polynomials satisfying a three-term recurrence whose coefficients are linear polynomials. We also extend this sum to a linear combination, whose coefficients are powers of az+b for a,b\in\mathbb{R}, of Chebyshev polynomials. In particular, we find necessary and sufficient conditions on a, b such that this linear combination is hyperbolic.
