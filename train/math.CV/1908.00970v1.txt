We generalize the Ahlfors-Bers theory to the adelic Riemann sphere. In particular, after defining the appropriate notion of a Beltrami differential in the solenoidal context, we give a sufficient condition on it such that the corresponding Beltrami equation has a quasiconformal homeomorphism solution; i.e. The Ahlfors-Bers Theorem in the solenoidal case. This additional condition on the solenoidal Beltrami differentials can be written as a Banach norm in a subspace of solenoidal differentials. Moreover, this subspace is the completion under this norm of those solenoidal differentials locally constant at the fiber. As a toy example, we show how this technique works on a linear problem: We generalize the diophantine equation complex analytic extension problem to the respective solenoidal space.
