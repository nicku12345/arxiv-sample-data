This paper deals with some special integral transforms of Bargmann-Fock type in the setting of quaternionic valued slice hyperholomorphic and Cauchy-Fueter regular functions. The construction is based on the well-known Fueter mapping theorem. In particular, starting with the normalized Hermite functions we can construct an Appell system of quaternionic regular polynomials. The ranges of such integral transforms are quaternionic reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces of regular functions. New integral representations and generating functions in this quaternionic setting are obtained in both the Fock and Bergman cases.
