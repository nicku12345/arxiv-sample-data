In the present paper we estimate the norm of the pre-Schwarzian derivative of bi-starlike functions of order \alpha where \alpha\in[0,1). Initially this problem was handled by Rahmatan et al. in [Bull Iran Math Soc {\bf43}: 1037-1043, 2017]. We pointed out that the proofs and bounds by Rahmatan et al. are incorrect and present correct proofs and bounds.
