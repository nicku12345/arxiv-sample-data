In this text, we recall some basics and results about complex geometry and currents in the complex scenario. Most of the results are classic and their evidence is not given here. On the other hand, we describe in detail some notions to help the reader who is unfamiliar with complex geometry or currents. The main references for abstract current theory are [Che03] [dR84] [Fed69] [Sch66] [War71]. The reader will find in [JP] [Gun90] [Hor83] [Lel68] [Nar66] the basics of chains in complex varieties. We also refer to [JP] [PA78] [Huy05] [Voi02] for K\"ahler's compact variety theory
