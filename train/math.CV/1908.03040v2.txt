In this paper we obtain an explicit formula of Cauchy--Szeg\"{o} kernel for quaternionic Siegel upper half space, and then based on this, we prove that the Cauchy--Szeg\"{o} projection on quaternionic Heisenberg group is a Calder\'on--Zygmund operator via verifying the size and regularity conditions for the kernel. Next, we also obtain a suitable version of pointwise lower bound for the kernel, which further implies the characterisations of the boundedness and compactness of commutator of the Cauchy--Szeg\"{o} operator via the BMO and VMO spaces on quaternionic Heisenberg group, respectively.
