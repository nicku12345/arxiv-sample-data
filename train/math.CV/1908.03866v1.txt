We present a boundary integral method for numerical computation of the capacity of generalized condensers. The presented method applies to a wide variety of generalized condenser geometry including the cases when the plates of the generalized condenser are bordered by piecewise smooth Jordan curves or are rectilinear slits. The presented method is used also to compute the harmonic measure in multiply connected domains.
