Suppose \mu be a Beltrami coefficient on the unit disk, which is compatible with a convex co-compact Fuchsian group G of the second kind. In this paper we show that if \displaystyle\frac{|\mu|^{2}}{1-|z|^{2}}dxdy  satisfies the Carleson condition on the infinite boundary boundary of the Dirichlet domain of G, then \displaystyle\frac{|\mu|^{2}}{1-|z|^{2}}dxdy is a Carleson measure on the unit disk.
