Since the great work on holomorphic curves into algebraic varieties intersecting hypersurfaces in general position established by Ru in 2009, recently there has been some developments on the second main theorem into algebraic varieties intersecting moving hypersurfaces targets. The main purpose of this paper is to give some interesting improvements of Ru's second main theorem for moving hypersurfaces targets located in subgeneral position with index.
