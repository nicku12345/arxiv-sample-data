We introduce a new class of entire functions \mathcal{E} which consists of all F_0\in\mathcal{O}(\mathbb{C}) for which there exists a sequence (F_n)\in \mathcal{O}(\mathbb{C}) and a sequence (\lambda_n)\in\mathbb{C} satisfying F_n(z)=\lambda_{n+1}e^{F_{n+1}(z)} for all n\geq 0. This new class is closed under the composition and its is dense in the space of all non-vanishing entire functions. We prove that every closed set V\subset \mathbb{C} containing the origin and at least one more point is the set of singular values of some locally univalent function in \mathcal{E}, hence this new class has non-trivial intersection with both the Speiser class and the Eremenko-Lyubich class of entire functions. As a consequence we provide a new proof of an old result by Heins which states that every closed set V\subset\mathbb{C} is the set of singular values of some locally univalent entire function. The novelty of our construction is that these functions are obtained as a uniform limit of a sequence of entire functions, the process under which the set of singular values is not stable. Finally we show that the class \mathcal{E} contains functions with an empty Fatou set and also functions whose Fatou set is non-empty.
