We introduce the concept of a new kind of symmetric homeomorphisms on the unit circle, which is derived from the generalization of symmetric homeomorphisms on the real line. By the investigation of the barycentric extension for this class of circle homeomorphisms and the biholomorphic automorphisms induced by trivial Beltrami coefficients, we endow a complex Banach manifold structure on the space of those generalized symmetric homeomorphisms.
