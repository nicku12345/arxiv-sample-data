In this paper, new class of bi-univalent functions are introduced and investigated. Using the Faber polynomials, estimation of the coefficients a_n of Maclaurin expansion of functions in this subclass are deduced. Certain Fekete-Szeg\"{o} inequality are concluded. Finally, some earlier results are modified and improved.
