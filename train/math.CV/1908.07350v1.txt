In this paper, new class of bi-univalent functions are introduced. Upper bound of the second Hankel determinant |H_2(2)| of subclass of bi-univalant functions class \Sigma, which defined by subordination, investigated. Furthermore, some results concluded as a special case of our main results and corrected some previous researchers results which investigated by miscalculation.
