Our objective in this paper is to introduce and investigate comprehensive-constructed subclasses of normalized analytic and bi-univalent functions on the unit open disc. Bounds for the second and third Tayler-Maclaurin coefficients of functions belonging to this subclasses were investigated. Furthermore, some improvement and connections to some of the previous known results are also pointed out.
