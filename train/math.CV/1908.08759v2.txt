We derive a formula for the number of pre-images under a non-degenerate harmonic mapping f, using the argument principle. This formula reveals a connection between the pre-images and the caustics. Our results allow to deduce the number of pre-images under f geometrically for every non-caustic point. We approximately locate the pre-images of points near the caustics. Moreover, we apply our results to prove that for every k = n, n+1, \ldots, n^2 there exists a harmonic polynomial of degree n with k zeros.
