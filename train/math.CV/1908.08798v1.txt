We interpolate a new family of Teichm\"uller spaces T_{\sharp}^X between the universal Teichm\"uller space T and its little subspace T_0, which we call the Teichm\"uller space of piecewise symmetric homeomorphisms. This is defined by prescribing a subset X of the unit circle. The inclusion relation of X induces a natural inclusion of T_{\sharp}^X, and an approximation of T is given by an increasing sequence of T_{\sharp}^X. In this paper, we discuss the fundamental properties of T_{\sharp}^X from the viewpoint of the quasiconformal theory of Teichm\"uller spaces. We also consider the quotient space of T by T_{\sharp}^X as an analog of the asymptotic Teichm\"uller space.
