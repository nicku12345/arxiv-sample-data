We extend the celebrated theorem of Kellogg for conformal mappings to the minimizers of Dirichlet energy. Namely we prove that a diffeomorphic minimiser of Dirichlet energy of Sobolev mappings between double connected domains D and \Omega having \mathscr{C}^{n,\alpha} boundary is \mathscr{C}^{n,\alpha} up to the boundary, provided \text{Mod}(D)\ge \text{Mod}(\Omega). If \text{Mod}(D)< \text{Mod}(\Omega) and n=1 we obtain that the diffeomorphic minimiser has \mathscr{C}^{1,\alpha'} extension up to the boundary, for \alpha'=\alpha/(2+\alpha). It is crucial that, every diffeomorphic minimizer of Dirichlet energy has a very special Hopf differential and this fact is used to prove that every diffeomorphic minimizer of Dirichlet energy can be locally lifted to a certain minimal surface near an arbitrary point inside and at the boundary.
