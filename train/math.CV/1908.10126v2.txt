In this paper, we deal with some geometric properties including starlikeness and convexity of order \alpha of Jackson's second and third q-Bessel functions which are natural extensions of classical Bessel function J_{\nu}. In additon, we determine some conditions on the parameters such that Jackson's second and third q-Bessel functions belong to the Hardy space and to the class of bounded analytic functions.
