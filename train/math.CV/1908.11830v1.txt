Let \psi  be a conformal map of \mathbb{D} onto an unbounded domain and, for \alpha >0, let {F_\alpha }=\left\{ {z \in \mathbb{D}:\left| {\psi \left( z \right)} \right| = \alpha } \right\}. If \omega _\mathbb{D}\left( {0,{F_\alpha }} \right) denotes the harmonic measure at 0 of F_\alpha  and d_\mathbb{D} {\left( {0,{F_\alpha }} \right)} denotes the hyperbolic distance between 0 and F_\alpha in \mathbb{D}, then an application of the Beurling-Nevanlinna projection theorem implies that {\omega _\mathbb{D}}\left( {0,{F_\alpha }} \right) \ge \frac{2}{\pi }{e^{ - {d_\mathbb{D}}\left( {0,{F_\alpha }} \right)}}. Thus a natural question, first stated by P. Poggi-Corradini, is the following: Does there exist a positive constant K such that for every \alpha >0, {\omega _\mathbb{D}}\left( {0,{F_\alpha }} \right) \le K{e^{ - {d_\mathbb{D}}\left( {0,{F_\alpha }} \right)}}? In general, we prove that the answer is negative by means of two different examples. However, under additional assumptions involving the number of components of F_\alpha and the hyperbolic geometry of the domain \psi \left( \mathbb{D} \right), we prove that the answer is positive.
