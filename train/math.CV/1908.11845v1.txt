Let \psi  be a conformal map on \mathbb{D} with  \psi \left( 0 \right)=0 and let {F_\alpha }=\left\{ {z \in \mathbb{D}:\left| {\psi \left( z \right)} \right| = \alpha } \right\} for \alpha >0. Denote by {H^p}\left( \mathbb{D} \right) the classical Hardy space with exponent p>0 and by {\tt h}\left( \psi \right) the Hardy number of \psi. Consider the limits  L:= \lim_{\alpha\to+\infty}\left( \log \omega_{\mathbb D}(0,F_{\alpha})^{-1}/\log \alpha \right), \,\, \mu:= \lim_{\alpha\to+\infty}\left( d_{\mathbb D}(0,F_{\alpha})/\log\alpha \right), where \omega _\mathbb{D}\left( {0,{F_\alpha }} \right) denotes the harmonic measure at 0 of F_\alpha  and d_\mathbb{D} {\left( {0,{F_\alpha }} \right)} denotes the hyperbolic distance between 0 and F_\alpha in \mathbb{D}. We study a problem posed by P. Poggi-Corradini. What is the relation between L, \mu and {\tt h}\left( \psi \right)? We also provide conditions for the existence of L and \mu and for the equalities L=\mu={\tt h}\left( \psi \right). Poggi-Corradini proved that \psi \notin {H^{\mu}}\left( \mathbb{D} \right) for a wide class of conformal maps \psi. We present an example of \psi such that \psi \in {H^\mu {\left( \mathbb{D} \right)} }.
