Let D \subset \mathbb{C} be a domain with 0 \in D. For R>0, let {{\hat \omega }_D}\left( {R} \right) denote the harmonic measure of  D \cap \left\{ {\left| z \right| = R} \right\} at 0 with respect to the domain  D \cap \left\{ {\left| z \right| < R} \right\}  and {\omega_D}\left( {R} \right) denote the harmonic measure of \partial D \cap \left\{ {\left| z \right| \ge R} \right\} at 0 with respect to D. The behavior of the functions {\omega_D} and {{\hat \omega }_D} near \infty determines (in some sense) how large D is. However, it is not known whether the functions {\omega_D} and {{\hat \omega }_D} always have the same behavior when R tends to \infty. Obviously, {\omega_D}\left( {R} \right) \le {{\hat \omega }_D}\left( {R} \right) for every R>0. Thus, the arising question, first posed by Betsakos, is the following: Does there exist a positive constant C such that for all simply connected domains D with 0 \in D and all R>0, \[{\omega_D}\left( {R} \right) \ge C{{\hat \omega }_D}\left( {R} \right)? \] In general, we prove that the answer is negative by means of two different counter-examples. However, under additional assumptions involving the geometry of D, we prove that the answer is positive. We also find the value of the optimal constant for starlike domains.
