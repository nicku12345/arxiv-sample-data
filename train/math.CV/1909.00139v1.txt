Schwick, in [6], states that let \mathcal{F} be a family of meromorphic functions on a domain D and if for each f\in\mathcal{F}, (f^n)^{(k)}\neq 1, for z\in D, where n, k are positive integers such that n\geq k+3, then \mathcal{F} is a normal family in D. In this paper, we investigate the opposite view that if for each f\in\mathcal{F}, (f^n)^{(k)}(z)-\psi(z) has zeros in D, where \psi(z) is a holomorphic function in D, then what can be said about the normality of the family \mathcal{F}?
