Through the Loewner equation, real-valued driving functions generate sets called Loewner hulls. We analyze driving functions that approach 0 at least as fast as a (T-t)^r as t \to T, where r \in (0, 1/2), and show that the corresponding Loewner hulls have tangential behavior at time T. We also prove a result about trace existence and apply it to show that the Loewner hulls driven by a(T-t)^r for r \in (0,1/2) have a tangential trace curve.
