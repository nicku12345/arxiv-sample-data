Let M be a complete K\"{a}hler manifold, whose universal covering is biholomorphic to a ball \mathbb B^m(R_0) in \mathbb C^m (0<R_0\le +\infty). In this article, we will show that if three meromorphic mappings f^1,f^2,f^3 of M into \mathbb P^n(\mathbb C)\ (n\ge 2) satisfying the condition (C_\rho) and sharing q\ (q> 2n+1+\alpha+\rho K) hyperplanes in general position regardless of multiplicity with certain positive constants K and \alpha <1 (explicitly estimated), then f^1=f^2 or f^2=f^3 or f^3=f^1. Moreover, if the above three mappings share the hyperplanes with mutiplicity counted to level n+1 then f^1=f^2=f^3. Our results generalize the finiteness and uniqueness theorems for meromorphic mappings of \mathbb C^m into \mathbb P^n(\mathbb C) sharing 2n+2 hyperplanes in general position with truncated multiplicity.
