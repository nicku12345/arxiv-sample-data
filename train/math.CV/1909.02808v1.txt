We study the factor-spaces of the unit ball of dimension, not less than three, by a certain group of M\"{o}bius transformations. For mappings of such spaces, an estimate of the distortion of the modulus of families of spheres is obtained. As applications, we obtain theorems on the locally and boundary behavior of the Orlicz--Sobolev classes between factor spaces.
