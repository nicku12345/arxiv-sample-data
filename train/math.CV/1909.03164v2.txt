We study the Bergman kernel of certain domains in \mathbb{C}^n, called elementary Reinhardt domains, generalizing the classical Hartogs triangle. For some elementary Reinhardt domains, we explicitly compute the kernel, which is a rational function of the coordinates. For some other such domains, we show that the kernel is not a rational function. For a general elementary Reinhardt domain, we obtain a representation of the kernel as an infinite series.
