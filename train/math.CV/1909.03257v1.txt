We first give a method to get multidimensional Leja sequences by considering intertwining sequences from one-dimensional ones. An application is the existence of explicit Leja sequences for the closed unit polydisc. Next, we deal with some applications in bidimensional Lagrange interpolation with intertwining Leja sequences. These results also require an explicit formula for the associated fundamental Lagrange polynomials with uniform estimates.
