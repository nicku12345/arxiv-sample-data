In this paper, we consider the weighted Hardy space \mathcal{H}^p(\omega) induced by an A_1 weight \omega. We characterize the positive Borel measure \mu such that the identical operator maps \mathcal{H}^p(\omega) into L^q(d\mu) boundedly when 0<p, q<\infty. As an application, we obtain necessary and sufficient conditions for the boundedness of generalized area operators A_{\mu,\nu} from \mathcal{H}^p(\omega) to L^q(\omega).
