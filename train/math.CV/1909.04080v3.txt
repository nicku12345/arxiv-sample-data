We develop a method for proving sup-norm and H\"older estimates for \overline{\partial} on wide class of finite type pseudoconvex domains in \mathbb{C}^n. A fundamental obstruction to proving sup-norm estimates is the possibility of singular complex curves with exceptionally high order of contact with the boundary. Our method handles this problem, and in \mathbb{C}^3, we prove sup-norm and H\"older estimates for all bounded, pseudoconvex domains with real-analytic boundary.
