Under certain geometric condition, the surfaces in \mathbb{C}^2 with isolated CR singularity at the origin and with cubic lowest degree homogeneous term in its graph near the origin, can be reduced, up to biholomorphism of \mathbb{C}^2, to a one parameter family of the form \[ M_t:=\left\{(z,w)\in\mathbb{C}^2: w=z^2\overline{z}+tz\overline{z}^2+\dfrac{t^2}{3} \overline{z}^3+o(|z|^3)\right\},\;\; t\in (0,\infty) \] near the origin. We prove that M_t is not locally polynomially convex if t<1. The local hull contains a ball centred at the origin if t<\sqrt{3}/2. We also prove that M_t is locally polynomially convex for t\geq\dfrac{\sqrt{15-\sqrt{33}}}{2\sqrt{2}}=1.076.... We show that, for \sqrt{3}/2\leq t<1, the local hull of M_t contains a one parameter family of analytic discs passing through the origin. We also show that local polynomial convexity of the union of finitely many pairwise transverse totally-real submanifolds of \mathbb{C}^n at the origin (their intersection) implies local polynomial convexity of the union of their sufficiently small \mathscr{C}^1-perturbation at their intersection, the origin. Some new results about the local polynomial convexity of the union of three totally-real planes are also reported.
