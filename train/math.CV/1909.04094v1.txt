In this paper we discuss a couple of observations related to polynomial convexity. More precisely,   (i) We observe that the union of finitely many disjoint closed balls with centres in \cup_{\theta\in[0,\pi/2]}e^{i\theta}V is polynomially convex, where V is a Lagrangian subspace of \mathbb{C}^n.   (ii) We show that any compact subset K of \{(z,w)\in\mathbb{C}^2: q(w)=\overline{p(z)}\}, where p and q are two non-constant holomorphic polynomials in one variable, is polynomially convex and \mathscr{P}(K)=\mathscr{C}(K).
