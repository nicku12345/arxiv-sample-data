Let \mathcal{A}_n be the class of analytic functions f(z) of the form f(z)=z+\sum_{k=n+1}^\infty a_kz^k,n\in\mathbb{N} and let \begin{align*} \Omega_n:=\left\{f\in\mathcal{A}_n:\left|zf'(z)-f(z)\right|<\frac{1}{2},\; z\in\mathbb{D}\right\}. \end{align*} We make use of differential subordination technique to obtain sufficient conditions for the class \Omega_n, and then employ these conditions to construct functions which involve double integrals and members of \Omega_n. We also consider a subclass \widehat{\Omega}_n\subset\Omega_n and obtain subordination results for members of \widehat{\Omega}_n besides a necessary and sufficient condition. Writing \Omega_1=\Omega, we obtain inclusion properties of \Omega with respect to functions defined on certain parabolic regions and as a consequence, establish a relation connecting the parabolic starlike class \mathcal{S}_p and the uniformly starlike UST. Various radius problems for the class \Omega are considered and the sharpness of the radii estimates is obtained analytically besides graphical illustrations.
