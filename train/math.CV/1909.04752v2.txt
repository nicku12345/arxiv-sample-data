Real-analytic CR functions on real-analytic CR singular submanifolds are not in general restrictions of holomorphic functions, unlike in the CR nonsingular case. We give a simple condition that completely characterizes those quadric CR singular manifolds of codimension 2 in {\mathbb C}^{n+1} for which an extension result holds. Consequently, we obtain an extension result for general real-analytic CR singular submanifolds of codimension 2. As applications we give a condition for the flattening of such submanifolds, and we classify CR singular images of CR submanifolds up to second order.
