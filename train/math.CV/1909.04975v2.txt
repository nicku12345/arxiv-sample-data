Firstly we establish a sharp pointwise estimate for the arbitrary derivative of the function f\in F_{\alpha}^{p}, where F_{\alpha}^{p} denotes the Fock space for 1\leq p<\infty. Then, in a particular Hilbert case when p=2 we establish another specific pointwise sharp estimate. We also consider the differential operator between F_{\alpha}^{p} and F_{\beta}^{p} for \beta>\alpha and its adjoint.
