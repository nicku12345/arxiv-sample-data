The principal goal of this paper is to extend the classical problem of find the values of \alpha\in \C for which the mappings, either F_\alpha(z)=\int_0^z(f(\zeta)/\zeta)^\alpha d\zeta or f_\alpha(z)=\int_0^z(f'(\zeta))^\alpha d\zeta are univalent, whenever f belongs to some subclasses of univalent mappings in \D, but in the case of harmonic mappings, considering the \textit{shear construction} introduced by Clunie and Sheil-Small in \cite{CSS}.
