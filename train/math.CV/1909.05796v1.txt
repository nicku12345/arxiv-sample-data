In this paper, we consider complex polynomials of degree three with distinct zeros and their polarization ((z1,z2,z3) with three complex variables. We show, through elementary means, that the variety P(z1,z2,z3)=0 is birationally equivalent to the variety z1z2z3 +1 = 0. Moreover, the rational map certifying the equivalence is a simple M\"obius transformation. The second goal of this note is to present a geometrical curiosity relating the zeros of P(z,z,zk) for k = 1,2,3, where (z1,z2,z3) is arbitrary point on the variety P(z1,z2 z3) = 0.
