In this work we study deBranges-Rovnyak spaces, H(b), on the unit ball of \mathbb{C}^n. We give an integral representation of the functions in H(b) through the Clark measure on S^n associated with b. A characterization of admissible boundary limits is given in relation with finite angular derivatives. Lastly, we examine the interplay between Clark measures and angular derivatives showing that Clark measure associated with b has an atom at a boundary point if and only if b has finite angular derivative at the same point.
