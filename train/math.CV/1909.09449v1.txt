In the spirit of Kobayashi's applications of methods of invariant metrics to questions of projective geometry, we introduce a projective analogue of the complex squeezing function. Using Frankel's work, we prove that for convex domains it stays uniformly bounded from below. In the case of strongly convex domains, we show that it tends to 1 at the boundary. This is applied to get a new proof of a projective analogue of the Wong-Rosay theorem.
