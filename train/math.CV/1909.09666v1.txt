We study estimates for Hardy space norms of analytic projections. We first find a sufficient condition for the Bergman projection of a function in the unit disc to belong to the Hardy space H^p for 1 < p < \infty. We apply the result to prove a converse to an extension of Ryabykh's theorem about Hardy space regularity for Bergman space extremal functions. We also prove that the H^q norm of the Szeg\"{o} projection of F^{p/2} \overline{F}^{(p/2)-1} cannot be too small if F is analytic, for certain values of p and q. We apply this to show that the best analytic approximation in L^p of a function in both L^p and L^q will also lie in L^q, for certain values of p and q.
