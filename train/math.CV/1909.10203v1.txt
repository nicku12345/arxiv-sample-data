In this paper, we study a class of Borel measures on \mathbb{R}^n that arises as the class of representing measures of Herglotz-Nevanlinna functions. In particular, we study product measures within this class where products with the Lebesgue measures play a special role. Hence, we give several characterizations of the n-dimensional Lebesgue measure among all such measures and characterize all product measures that appear in this class of measures. Furthermore, analogous results for the class of positive Borel measures on the unit poly-torus with vanishing mixed Fourier coefficients are also presented, and the relation between the two classes of measures with regard to the obtained results is discussed.
