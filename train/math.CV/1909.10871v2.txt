In this paper, we prove the existence of (global) solutions of the Poincar\'e-Lelong equation \partial\overline{\p}u=f, where f is a d-closed (1,1) form and is in the weighted Hilbert space with Gaussian measure, i.e., L^2_{(1,1)}(\mathbb{C}^n,e^{-|z|^2}). The novelty of this paper is to apply a weighted L^2 version of Poincar\'e Lemma for 2-forms, and then apply H\"{o}rmander's L^2 solutions for Cauchy-Riemann equations. In the both cases, the same weight e^{-|z|^2} is used.
