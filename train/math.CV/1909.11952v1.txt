Let X be a compact Riemann surface of genus g. Jacobi's inversion theorem states that the Abel-Jacobi map \varphi : X^{(g)} \longrightarrow J(X) is surjective, where X^{(g)} is the symmetric product of X of degree g and J(X) is the Jacobi variety of X. Riemann obtained the explicit solution of the Jacobi inversion problem introducing Riemann's theta functions. We study such a problem for singular curves. We define a generalization of Riemann's theta functions and Riemann's constants. We obtain similar results for singular curves.
