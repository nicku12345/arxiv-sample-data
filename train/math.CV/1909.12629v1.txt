In this paper, we study the regular quantizations of K\"{a}hler manifolds by using the first two coefficients of Bergman function expansions. Firstly, we obtain sufficient and necessary conditions for certain Hermitian holomorphic vector bundles and their ball subbundles to be regular quantizations. Secondly, we obtain that some projective bundles over the Fano manifolds M admit regular quantizations if and only if M are biholomorphically isomorphism to the complex projective spaces. Finally, we obtain the balanced metrics on certain Hermitian holomorphic vector bundles and their ball subbundles over the Riemann sphere.
