Many fundamental results of pluripotential theory on the quaternionic space \mathbb{H}^n are extended to the Heisenberg group. We introduce notions of a plurisubharmonic function, the quaternionic Monge-Amp\`{e}re operator, differential operators d_0 and d_1 and a closed positive current on the Heisenberg group. The quaternionic Monge-Amp\`{e}re operator is the coefficient of  (d_0d_1u)^n. We establish the Chern-Levine-Nirenberg type estimate, the existence of quaternionic Monge-Amp\`{e}re measure for a continuous quaternionic plurisubharmonic function and the minimum principle for the quaternionic Monge-Amp\`{e}re operator. Unlike the tangential Cauchy-Riemann operator  \overline{\partial}_b  on the Heisenberg group which behaves badly as  \partial_b\overline{\partial}_b\neq -\overline{\partial}_b\partial_b , the quaternionic counterpart d_0 and d_1 satisfy  d_0d_1=-d_1d_0 . This is the main reason that we have a better theory for the quaternionic Monge-Amp\`{e}re operator than  (\partial_b\overline{\partial}_b)^n.
