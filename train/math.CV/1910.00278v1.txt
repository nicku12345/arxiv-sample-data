We study the root distribution of a sequence of polynomials \{P_n(z)\}_{n=0}^{\infty} with the rational generating function  \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} P_n(z)t^n= \frac{1}{1+ B(z)t^\ell +A(z)t^k} for (k,\ell)=(3,2) and (4,3) where A(z) and B(z) are arbitrary polynomials in z with complex coefficients. We show that the zeros of P_n(z) which satisfy A(z)B(z)\neq 0 lie on a real algebraic curve which we describe explicitly.
