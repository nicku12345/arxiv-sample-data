The well-known \mathcal{E}-sets introduced by Hayman in 1960 are collections of Euclidean discs in the complex plane with the following property: The set of angles \theta for which the ray \arg(z)=\theta meets infinitely many discs in a given \mathcal{E}-set has linear measure zero. An important special case of an \mathcal{E}-set is known as the R-set. These sets appear in numerous papers in the theories of complex differential and functional equations. This paper offers a continuous transition from \mathcal{E}-sets to R-sets, and then to much thinner sets. In addition to rays, plane curves that originate from the zero distribution theory of exponential polynomials will be considered. It turns out that almost every such curve meets at most finitely many discs in the collection in question. Analogous discussions are provided in the case of the unit disc \mathbb{D}, where the curves tend to the boundary \partial\mathbb{D} tangentially or non-tangentially. Finally, these findings will be used for improving well-known estimates for logarithmic derivatives, logarithmic differences and logarithmic q-differences of meromorphic functions, as well as for improving standard results on exceptional sets.
