In this article, we introduce a new family of sense preserving harmonic mappings f in the open unit disk and prove that functions in this family are close-to-convex. We give some basic properties such as coefficient bounds, growth estimates, convolution and determine the radius of convexity for the functions belonging to this family. In addition, we construct certain harmonic univalent polynomials belonging to this family.
