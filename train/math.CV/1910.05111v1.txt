For a nice holomorphic function f(s, z) in two variables, a respective holomorphic Gamma function \Gamma = \Gamma_f is constructed, such that f(s, \Gamma(s)) = \Gamma(s + 1). Along the way, we fall through a rabbit hole of infinite compositions, First Order Difference Equations, and absurd functional equations... This paper is orchestrated around an investigation into the unconventional equation \Delta y = y(s+1)-y(s) = e^{sy(s)} and its solutions in the complex plane.
