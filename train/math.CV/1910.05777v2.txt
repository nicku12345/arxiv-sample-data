We study the density of polynomials in H^2(E,\varphi), the space of square integrable functions with respect to e^{-\varphi}dm and holomorphic on the interior of E in \mathbb{C}, where \varphi is a subharmonic function and dm is a measure on E. We give a result where E is the union of a Lipschitz graph and a Carath\'{e}odory domain, that we state as a weighted L^2-version of the Mergelyan theorem. We also prove a weighted L^2-version of the Carleman theorem.   Keywords: Mergelyan theorem, Carleman theorem, Weighted L^2- spaces, Rectifiable non-Lipschitz arc
