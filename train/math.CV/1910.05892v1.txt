The Fock-Bargmann-Hartogs domain D_{n, m}(\mu) is defined by  D_{n, m}(\mu):=\{(z, w)\in\mathbb{C}^{n}\times\mathbb{C}^m:\Vert w \Vert^2<e^{-\mu\Vert z \Vert^2}\}, where \mu>0. The Fock-Bargmann-Hartogs domain D_{n, m}(\mu) is an unbounded strongly pseudoconvex domain with smooth real-analytic boundary. In this paper, we first compute the weighted Bergman kernel of D_{n, m}(\mu) with respect to the weight (-\rho)^{\alpha}, where \rho(z,w):=\|w\|^2-e^{-\mu \|z\|^2} is a defining function for D_{n, m}(\mu) and \alpha>-1. Then, for p\in [1,\infty), we show that the corresponding weighted Bergman projection P_{D_{n, m}(\mu), (-\rho)^{\alpha}} is unbounded on L^p(D_{n, m}(\mu), (-\rho)^{\alpha}), except for the trivial case p=2. In particular, this paper gives an example of an unbounded strongly pseudoconvex domain whose ordinary Bergman projection is L^p irregular when p\in [1,\infty)\setminus\{2\}. This result turns out to be completely different from the well-known positive L^p regularity result on bounded strongly pseudoconvex domain.
