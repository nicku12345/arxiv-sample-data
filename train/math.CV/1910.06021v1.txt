A function f\in \mathcal{A}_1 is said to be stable with respect to g\in \mathcal{A}_1  if \begin{align*} \frac{s_n(f(z))}{f(z)} \prec \frac{1}{g(z)}, \qquad z\in\mathbb{D}, \end{align*} holds for all n \in \mathbb{N} where \mathcal{A}_1 denote the class of analytic functions f in the unit disk \mathbb{D} =\{z\in \mathbb{C}: |z|<1 \} normalized by f(0)=1. Here s_n(f(z)), the n^{th} partial sum   of f(z)=\displaystyle\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} a_kz^k is given by s_n(f(z)) = \displaystyle\sum_{k=0}^{n} a_kz^k, \ n\in \mathbb{N} \cup \{0\}. In this work, we consider the following function \begin{align*} v_{\lambda}(A,B,z)=\left(\frac{1+Az}{1+Bz}\right)^{\lambda} \end{align*} for -1\leq B < A \leq 1 and 0\leq \lambda \leq 1  for our investigation. The main purpose of this paper is to prove that v_{\lambda}(A,B,z) is stable with respect to \displaystyle v_{\lambda}(0,B,z)= \frac{1}{(1+Bz)^{\lambda}} for 0 < \lambda \leq 1  and -1\leq B < A \leq 0. Further, we prove that v_{\lambda}(A,B,z) is not stable with respect to itself, when 0 < \lambda \leq 1  and -1\leq B < A <0. \end{abstract}
