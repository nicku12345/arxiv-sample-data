In this paper we show that the space of holomorphic immersions from any given open Riemann surface, M, into the Riemann sphere \mathbb{CP}^1 is weakly homotopy equivalent to the space of continuous maps from M to the complement of the zero section in the tangent bundle of \mathbb{CP}^1. We show in particular that this space has 2^k path components, where H_1(M,\mathbb Z)={\mathbb Z}^k. We also prove a parametric version of Mergelyan approximation theorem for maps from Riemann surfaces into any complex manifold, a result used in the proof of our main theorem.
