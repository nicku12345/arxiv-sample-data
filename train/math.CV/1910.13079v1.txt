The exponential Teichm\"uller spaces E_p, 0\leq p \leq \infty, interpolate between the classical Teichm\"uller space (p=\infty) and the space of harmonic diffeomorphisms (p=0). In this article we prove the existence of non-variational critical points for the associated functional: mappings f of the disk whose distortion is p-exponentially integrable, 0<p<\infty, yet for {\em any} diffeomorphism g(z) of \ID with g|\partial\ID=identity and g\neq identity we have f\circ g is not of p-exponentially integrable distortion.
