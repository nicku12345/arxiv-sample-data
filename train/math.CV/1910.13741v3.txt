The definition of classical holomorphic function spaces such as the Hardy space or the Dirichlet space on the Hartogs triangle is not canonical. In this paper we introduce a natural family of holomorphic function spaces on the Hartogs triangle which includes some weighted Bergman spaces, a candidate Hardy space and a candidate Dirichlet space. For the weighted Bergman spaces and the Hardy space we study the L^p mapping properties of Bergman and Szeg\H{o} projection respectively, whereas for the Dirichlet space we prove it is isometric to the Dirichlet space on the bidisc.
