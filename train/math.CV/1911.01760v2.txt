The main purpose of the note is to explore the invariant properties of sphericalization and flattening and their applications in quasi-metric spaces. We show that sphericalization and flattening procedures on a quasimetric spaces preserving properties such as Ahlfors regular and doubling property. By using these properties, we generalize a recent result in \cite{WZ}. We also show that the Loewner condition can be preserved under quasim\"obius mapping between two Q-Ahlfors regular spaces. Finally, we prove that the Q-regularity of Q-dimensional Hausdorff measure of Bourdon metric are coincided with Hausdorff measure of Hamenst\"adt metric defined on the boundary at infinity of a Gromov hyperbolic space.
