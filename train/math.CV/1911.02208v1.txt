Convolutions or Hadamard products of analytic functions is a well explored area of research and many nice results are available in literature. On the other hand, very little is known in general about the convolutions of univalent harmonic mappings. So, researchers started exploring properties of convolutions of some specific univalent harmonic mappings and while doing so, they have mostly used well known Cohn's rule or/and Schur-Cohn's algorithm, which involves computations that are very cumbersome. The main objective of this article is to present an alternative approach, which requires very less computational efforts and allows us to prove more general results. Most of the earlier known results follow as particular cases of the results proved herein.
