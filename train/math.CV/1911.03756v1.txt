We work in the setting of weighted pluripotential theory arising from polynomials associated to a convex body P in ({\bf R}^+)^d. We define the {\it logarithmic indicator function} on {\bf C}^d: H_P(z):=\sup_{ J\in P} \log |z^{ J}|:=\sup_{ J\in P} \log[|z_1|^{ j_1}\cdots |z_d|^{ j_d}] and an associated class of plurisubharmonic (psh) functions: L_P:=\{u\in PSH({\bf C}^d): u(z)- H_P(z) =0(1), \ |z| \to \infty \}. We first show that L_P is not closed under standard smoothing operations. However, utilizing a continuous regularization due to Ferrier which preserves L_P, we prove a general Siciak-Zaharjuta type-result in our P-setting: the weighted P-extremal function V_{P,K,Q}(z):=\sup \{u(z):u\in L_P, \ u\leq Q \ \hbox{on} \ K\} associated to a compact set K and an admissible weight Q on K can be obtained using the subclass of L_P arising from functions of the form \frac{1}{deg_P(p)}\log |p| (appropriately normalized).
