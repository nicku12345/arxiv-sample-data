The classical inequality of Bohr asserts that if a power series converges in the unit disk and its sum has modulus less than or equal to 1, then the sum of absolute values of its terms is less than or equal to 1 for the subdisk |z|<1/3 and 1/3 is the best possible constant. Recently, there has been a number of investigations on this topic. In this article, we present a refined version of Bohr's inequality along with few other related improved versions of previously known results.
