In 1909, Hardy gave an example of a transcendental entire function, f, with the property that the set of points where f achieves its maximum modulus, \mathcal{M}(f), has infinitely many discontinuities. This is one of only two known examples of such a function.   In this paper we significantly generalise these examples. In particular, we show that, given an increasing sequence of positive real numbers, tending to infinity, there is a transcendental entire function, f, such that \mathcal{M}(f) has discontinuities with moduli at all these values. We also show that the transcendental entire function lies in the much studied Eremenko-Lyubich class. Finally, we show that, with an additional hypothesis on the sequence, we can ensure that f has finite order.
