We first give a sufficient condition, issued from pluripotential theory, for an unbounded domain in the complex Euclidean space \mathbb C^n to be Kobayashi hyperbolic. Then, we construct an example of a rigid pseudoconvex domain in \mathbb C^3 that is Kobayashi hyperbolic and has a nonempty core. In particular, this domain is not biholomorphic to a bounded domain in \mathbb C^3 and the mentioned above sufficient condition for Kobayashi hyperbolicity is not necessary.
