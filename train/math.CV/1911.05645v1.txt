In this study, a normalized form of regular Coulomb wave function is considered. By using differential subordination method due to Miller and Mocanu, we determine some conditions on the parameters such that the normalized regular Coulomb wave function is lemniscate starlike and exponenetial starlike in the open unit disk, respectively.
