We prove regularity of solutions of the \bar\partial-problem in the H\"older-Zygmund spaces of bounded, strongly \mathbf C-linearly convex domains of class C^{1,1}. The proofs rely on a new, analytic characterization of said domains which is of independent interest, and on techniques that were recently developed by the first-named author to prove estimates for the \bar\partial-problem on strongly pseudoconvex domains of class C^2.
