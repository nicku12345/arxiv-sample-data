Let u\not\equiv -\infty and M\not\equiv -\infty are two subharmonic functions in the complex plane \mathbb C with the Riesz measures \nu_u and \mu_M such that u(z)\leq O(|z|) and M(z)\leq O(|z|) as z\to \infty. If the growth of a function M in some sense exceeds the growth of a function u on some straight line, then we can expect measure \mu_M to dominate measure \nu_u in some sense. We give quantitative forms of such dominance. The main results are illustrated by a new uniqueness theorem for entire functions of exponential type.
