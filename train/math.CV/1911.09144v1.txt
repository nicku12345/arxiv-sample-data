In this paper we consider the problem of reconstructing solutions to a generalized Moisil-Teodorescu system in Jordan domains of \mathbb{R}^{3} with rectifiable boundary. In order to determine conditions for existence of solutions to the problem we embed the system in an appropriate generalized quaternionic setting.
