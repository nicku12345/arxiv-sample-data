Assuming that A_0,\ldots,A_{n-1} are entire functions and that p\in \{0,\ldots,n-1\} is the smallest index such that A_p is transcendental, then, by a classical theorem of Frei, each solution base of the differential equation f^{(n)}+A_{n-1}f^{(n-1)}+\cdots +A_{1}f'+A_{0}f=0 contains at least n-p entire functions of infinite order. Here, the transcendental coefficient A_p dominates the growth of the polynomial coefficients A_{p+1},\ldots,A_{n-1}. By expressing the dominance of A_p in different ways, and allowing the coefficients A_{p+1},\ldots,A_{n-1} to be transcendental, we show that the conclusion of Frei's theorem still holds along with an additional estimation on the asymptotic lower bound for the growth of solutions. At times these new refined results give a larger number of linearly independent solutions of infinite order than the original theorem of Frei. For such solutions, we show that 0 is the only possible finite deficient value. Previously this property has been known to hold for so-called admissible solutions and is commonly cited as Wittich's theorem. Analogous results are discussed for linear differential equations in the unit disc, as well as for complex difference and complex q-difference equations.
