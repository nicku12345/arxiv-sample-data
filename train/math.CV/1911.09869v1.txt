Meromorphic solutions of non-linear differential equations of the form f^n+P(z,f)=h are investigated, where n\geq 2 is an integer, h is a meromorphic function, and P(z,f) is differential polynomial in f and its derivatives with small functions as its coefficients. In the existing literature this equation has been studied in the case when h has the particular form h(z)=p_1(z)e^{\alpha_1(z)}+p_2(z)e^{\alpha_2(z)}, where p_1, p_2 are small functions of f and \alpha_1,\alpha_2 are entire functions. In such a case the order of h is either a positive integer or equal to infinity. In this article it is assumed that h is a meromorphic solution of the linear differential equation h'' +r_1(z) h' +r_0(z) h=r_2(z) with rational coefficients r_0,r_1,r_2, and hence the order of h is a rational number. Recent results by Liao-Yang-Zhang (2013) and Liao (2015) follow as special cases of the main results.
