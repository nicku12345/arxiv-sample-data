A quantitative version of strong localization of the Kobayashi, Azukawa and Sibony metrics, as well as of the squeezing function, near a plurisubharmonic peak boundary point of a domain in \Bbb C^n is given. As an applicatio\-n, the behavior of these metrics near a strictly pseudoconvex boundary point is studied. A weak localization of the three metrics and the squeezing function is also given near a plurisubharmonic antipeak boundary point.
