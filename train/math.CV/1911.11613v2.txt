The main purpose of the present paper is to determine the radii of starlikeness and convexity associated with lemniscate of Bernoulli and the Janowski function, (1+Az)/(1+Bz) for -1\leq B<A\leq 1, of normalized Wright functions. The key tools in the proof of our main results are the infinite product representation of Wright function and properties of real zeros of the Wright function and its derivative.
