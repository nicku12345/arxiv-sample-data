In this paper, we first study the definition and the continuity of the complex Hessian operator associated to an m-positive closed current T, for some classes of unbounded m-subharmonic functions as well as when we consider a regularization sequence of T. Next, we introduce the notion of weighted (m,T)-capacity in the complex Hessian setting and we investigate the link with the weighted m-extremal function. As an application we give a characterization of the Cegrell classes {\mathscr F}^m and {\mathscr E}^m by means of the weighted (m,1)-capacity. Furthermore, we prove a subsolution theorem for a general complex Hessian equation relatively to T.
