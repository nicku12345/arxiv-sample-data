In [4], D'Angelo introduced the notion of points of finite type for a real hypersurface M in \mathbb C^n and showed that the set of points of finite type in M is open. Later, Lamel-Mir [8] considered a natural extension of D'Angelo's definition for an arbitrary set M in \mathbb C^n. Building on D'Angelo's work, we prove the openness of the set of points of finite type for any subset M in  \mathbb C^n.
