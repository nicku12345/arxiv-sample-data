Let the function \varphi be holomorphic in the unit disk \mathbb{D} of the complex plane \mathbb{C} and let \varphi (\mathbb{D})\subset \mathbb{D}. We study the level sets and the critical points of the hyperbolic derivative of \varphi, |D_{\varphi}(z)|:=\frac{(1-|z|^2)|\varphi'(z)|}{1-|\varphi(z)|^2}. In particular, we show how the Schwarzian derivative of \varphi reveals the nature of the critical points.
