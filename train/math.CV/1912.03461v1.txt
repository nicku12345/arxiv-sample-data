We consider a problem of whether a property of holomorphic curves on a subset X of the complex plane can be extended to the whole complex plane. In this paper, the property we consider is uniqueness of holomorphic curves. We introduce the propagation set. Simply speaking, X is a propagation set if linear relation of holomorphic curves on the part of preimage of hyperplanes contained in X can be extended to the whole complex plane. If the holomorphic curves are of infinite order, we prove the existence of a propagation set which is the union of a sequence of disks (In fact, the method applies to the case of finite order). For a general case, the union of a sequence of annuli will be a propagation set. The classic five-value theorem and four-value theorem of R. Nevanlinna are established in such propagation sets.
