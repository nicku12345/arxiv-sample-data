We study smoothing properties of the Bergman projection and also of weighted Bergman projections. In particular, we relate these properties to the hyperconvexity index of a pseudoconvex domain in \mathbb{C}^{n}. The notion of a hyperconvexity index was first introduced by B.Y. Chen, which provides a flexible criterion for studying geometric properties of hyperconvex domains. We also obtain a new estimate of weighted Bergman projections, which improves a well-known estimate of Berndtsson and Charpentier. We give several applications of this estimate, including the study of smoothing properties of weighted Bergman projections.
