Expanding on my former work in [1] and with the work of Kasuya and Takase in [5], we demonstrate that for a given link L \subset M which is null-homologous in H_1(M) and for any smooth 2-plane field \eta over L there exists a smooth embedding F:M \hookrightarrow \mathbb{C}^3 so that the complex tangents of the embedding is exactly L and at each x \in L the holomorphic tangent is exactly \eta_x.
