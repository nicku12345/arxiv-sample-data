Let \mathcal{S}^*_{Ne} be the collection of all analytic functions f(z) defined on the open unit disk \mathbb{D} and satisfying the normalizations f(0)=f'(0)-1=0 such that the quantity zf'(z)/f(z) assumes values from the range of the function \varphi_{\scriptscriptstyle{Ne}}(z):=1+z-z^3/3\,,z\in\mathbb{D}, which is the interior of the nephroid given by \begin{align*} \left((u-1)^2+v^2-\frac{4}{9}\right)^3-\frac{4 v^2}{3}=0. \end{align*} In this work, we find sharp \mathcal{S}^*_{Ne}-radii for several geometrically defined function classes introduced in the recent past. In particular, \mathcal{S}^*_{Ne}-radius for the starlike class \mathcal{S}^* is found to be 1/4. Moreover, radii problems related to the families defined in terms of ratio of functions are also discussed. Sharpness of certain radii estimates are illustrated graphically.
