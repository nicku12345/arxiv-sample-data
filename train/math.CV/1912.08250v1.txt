We give a characterization of complete interpolating sequences for the Fock spaces \mathcal{F}^p_\varphi,\ 1\leq p<\infty, where \varphi(z)=\alpha\left(\log^+|z|\right)^2,\ \alpha>0. Our results are {analogous} to the classical Kadets-Ingham's 1/4-Theorem on perturbation of Riesz bases of complex exponentials, and they answer a question asked by A. Baranov, A. Dumont, A. Hartmann and K. Kellay in \cite[page 31]{baranov2015sampling}.
