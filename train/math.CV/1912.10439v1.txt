We show that every quasihyperbolic geodesic in a John space admitting a roughly starlike Gromov hyperbolic quasihyperbolization is a cone arc. This result provides a new approach to the elementary metric geometry question, formulated in \cite[Question 2]{Hei89}, which has been studied by Gehring, Hag, Martio and Heinonen. As an application, we obtain a simple geometric condition connecting uniformity of the space with the existence of Gromov hyperbolic quasihyperbolization.
