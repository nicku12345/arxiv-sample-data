For f(z) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} a_n z^n and a fixed z in the unit disk, |z| = r, the Bohr operator \mathcal{M}_r is given by \[\mathcal{M}_r (f) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} |a_n| |z^n| = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} |a_n| r^n.\] This papers develops normed theoretic approaches on \mathcal{M}_r. Using earlier results of Bohr and Rogosinski, the following results are readily established: if f(z)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} a_{n}z^{n} is subordinate (or quasi-subordinate) to h(z)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} b_{n}z^{n} in the unit disk, then \[\mathcal{M}_{r}(f) \leq \mathcal{M}_{r}(h), \quad 0 \leq r \leq 1/3,\] that is, \[\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \ | a_{n}\ | |z|^{n} \leq \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \ | b_{n}\ |t |z|^{n}, \quad 0 \leq |z| \leq 1/3. \] Further, each k-th section s_k(f) = a_0 + a_1 z + \cdots + a_kz^k satisfies \[\ | s_k(f)\ | \leq \mathcal{M}_r \ ( s_k(h)\ ), \quad 0 \leq r \leq 1/2,\] and \[\mathcal{M}_{r}\ ( s_{k}(f) \ ) \leq \mathcal{M}_{r}(s_{k}(h)), \quad 0 \leq r \leq 1/3.\] A von Neumann-type inequality is also obtained for the class consisting of Schwarz functions in the unit disk.
