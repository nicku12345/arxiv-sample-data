The Clausen's Hypergeometric Function is given by {}_3F_2(a,b,c;d,e;z) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{(a)_n(b)_n(c)_n}{(d)_n(e)_n(1)_n}z^n\, ; \ a,b,c,d,e\in \mathbb{C} provided d,\, e\, \neq 0,-1,-2,\cdots in unit disc \mathbb{D} =\{z\in \mathbb{C} \,:\, |z|<1\}. In this paper, an operator \mathcal{I}_{a,b,c}(f)(z) involving Clausen's Hypergeometric Function by means of Hadamard Product is introduced. Geometric properties of \mathcal{I}_{a,b,c}(f)(z) are obtained based on its Taylor's coefficient.
