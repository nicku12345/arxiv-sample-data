Let (X, \omega) be a compact K\"ahler manifold of complex dimension n and \theta be a smooth closed real (1,1)-form on X such that its cohomology class \{ \theta \}\in H^{1,1}(X, \mathbb{R}) is pseudoeffective. Let \varphi be a \theta-psh function, and let f be a continuous function on X with bounded distributional laplacian with respect to \omega such that \varphi \leq f.    Then the non-pluripolar measure \theta_\varphi^n:= (\theta + dd^c \varphi)^n satisfies the equality:  {\bf{1}}_{\{ \varphi = f \}} \ \theta_\varphi^n = {\bf{1}}_{\{ \varphi = f \}} \ \theta_f^n, where, for a subset T\subseteq X, {\bf{1}}_T is the characteristic function. In particular we prove that \[ \theta_{P_{\theta}(f)}^n= { \bf {1}}_{\{P_{\theta}(f) = f\}} \ \theta_f^n\qquad {\rm and }\qquad \theta_{P_\theta[\varphi](f)}^n = { \bf {1}}_{\{P_\theta[\varphi](f) = f \}} \ \theta_f^n. \]
