Let E be an arbitrary closed set on the unit circle \partial \mathbb{D}, u be a harmonic function on the unit disk \mathbb{D} satisfying |u(z)|\lesssim (1-|z|)^\gamma \rho^{-q}(z) where \rho(z)= \mathop{\rm dist}(z, E), \gamma, q are some real constants, \gamma\le q. We establish an estimate of the conjugate \tilde u of the same type which is sharp in some sense and in the case E=\partial D coincides with known estimates. As an application we describe growth classes defined by the non-radial condition |u(z)|\lesssim \rho^{-q}(z) in terms of smoothness of the Stieltjes measure associated to the harmonic function u.
