Let f be a transcendental meromorphic function defined in the complex plane \mathbb{C}. We consider the value distribution of the differential polynomial f^{q_{0}}(f^{(k)})^{q_{k}}, where q_{0}(\geq 2), q_{k}(\geq 1) are k(\geq1) non-negative integers. We obtain a quantitative estimation of the characteristic function T(r, f) in terms of \overline{N}\left(r,\frac{1}{f^{q_{_{0}}}(f^{(k)})^{q_{k}}-1}\right).\par Our result generalizes the results obtained by Xu et al. (Math. Inequal. Appl., 14, 93-100, 2011) and Karmakar and Sahoo (Results Math., 73, 2018) for a particular class of transcendental meromorphic functions.
