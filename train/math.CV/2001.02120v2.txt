We establish a Wiman-Valiron theory of a polynomial series based on the Askey-Wilson operator \mathcal{D}_q, where q\in(0,1). For an entire function f of log-order smaller than 2, this theory includes (i) an estimate which shows that f behaves locally like a polynomial consisting of the terms near the maximal term of its Askey-Wilson series expansion, and (ii) an estimate of \mathcal{D}_q^n f compared to f. We then apply this theory in studying the growth of entire solutions to difference equations involving the Askey-Wilson operator.
