In this paper we study some extremal problems for the family S_g^0(\mathbb{B}_X) of normalized univalent mappings with g-parametric representation on the unit ball \mathbb{B}_X of an n-dimensional JB^*-triple X with r\geq 2, where r is the rank of X and g is a convex (univalent) function on the unit disc \mathbb{U}, which satisfies some natural assumptions. We obtain sharp coefficient bounds for the family S_g^0(\mathbb{B}_X), and examples of bounded support points for various subsets of S_g^0(\mathbb{B}_X). Our results are generalizations to bounded symmetric domains of known recent results related to support points for families of univalent mappings on the Euclidean unit ball \mathbb{B}^n and the unit polydisc \mathbb{U}^n in \mathbb{C}^n. Certain questions will be also mentioned. Finally, we point out sharp coefficient bounds and bounded support points for the family S_g^0(\mathbb{B}^n) and for special compact subsets of S_g^0(\mathbb{B}^n), in the case n\geq 2.
