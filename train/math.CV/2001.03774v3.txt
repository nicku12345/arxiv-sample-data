The purpose of this paper is to study H\"older estimates for the \bar\partial problem for (p,q) forms on products of general planar domains. As indicated by an example of Stein and Kerzman, solutions to the \bar\partial problem on product domains in \mathbb C^n (n\ge 2) does not gain regularity in H\"older spaces. Making use of an integral representation of Nijenhuis and Woolf, we show that given a \bar\partial-closed (p,q) form with C^{k,\alpha} components, 0\le p\le n, 1\le q\le n, k\in \mathbb Z^+\cup \{0\}, 0<\alpha\le 1, there is a C^{k, \alpha'} solution to the \bar\partial problem on product domains for any 0<\alpha'<\alpha with the desired H\"older estimate.
