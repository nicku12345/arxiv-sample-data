This paper is motivated by a claim in the classical textbook of Muskhelishvili concerning the Cauchy singular integral operator S on H\"older functions with parameters. To the contrary of the claim, a counter example was constructed by Tumanov which shows that S with parameters fails to maintain the same H\"older regularity with respect to the parameters. In view of the example, the behavior of the Cauchy singular integral operator with parameters between a type of Log-H\"older spaces is investigated to obtain the sharp norm estimates. At the end of the paper, we discuss its application to the \bar\partial problem on product domains.
