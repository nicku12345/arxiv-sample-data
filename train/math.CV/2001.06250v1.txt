New results on the oscillation of solutions of f''+A(z)f=0 and on the growth of solutions of f''+A(z)f'+B(z)f=0 are obtained, where A and B are entire functions. Petrenko's magnitudes of deviation of g with respect to \infty play a key r\^ole in the results, where g represents one of the coefficients A or B. These quantities are defined by \beta^-(\infty,g) = \liminf_{r\to\infty} \frac{\log M(r,g)}{T(r,g)} and \beta^+(\infty,g) = \limsup_{r\to\infty} \frac{\log M(r,g)}{T(r,g)}.
