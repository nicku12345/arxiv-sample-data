Let (z_k) be a sequence of distinct points in the unit disc \mathbb{D} without limit points there. We are looking for a function a(z) analytic in \mathbb{D} and such that possesses a solution having zeros precisely at the points z_k, and the resulting function a(z) has `minimal' growth. We focus on the case of non-separated sequences (z_k) in terms of the pseudohyperbolic distance when the coefficient a(z) is of zero order, but \sup_{z\in \mathbb{D}} (1-|z|)^p |a(z)|=+\infty for any p>0. We established a new estimate for the maximum modulus of a(z) in terms of the functions n_z(t)=\sum_{|z_k-z|\le t} 1  and N_z(r)=\int_0^r \frac{(n_z(t)-1)^+}{t}dt. The estimate is sharp in some sense. The main result relies on a new interpolation theorem.
