In this paper, we prove the existence of solutions of the Poincar\'e-Lelong equation \sqrt{-1}\partial\bar{\partial}u=f on a strictly convex bounded domain \Omega\subset\mathbb{C}^n (n\geq1), where f is a d-closed (1,1) form and is in the weighted Hilbert space L^2_{(1,1)}(\Omega,e^{-\varphi}). The novelty of this paper is to apply a weighted L^2 version of Poincar\'e Lemma for real 2-forms, and then apply H\"{o}rmander's L^2 solutions for Cauchy-Riemann equations.
