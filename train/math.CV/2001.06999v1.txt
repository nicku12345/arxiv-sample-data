This paper studies analytic functions f defined on the open unit disk of the complex plane for which f/g and (1+z)g/z are both functions with positive real part for some analytic function g. We determine radius constants of these functions to belong to classes of strong starlike functions, starlike functions of order \alpha, parabolic starlike functions, as well as to the classes of starlike functions associated with lemniscate of Bernoulli, cardioid, lune, reverse lemniscate, sine function, exponential function and a particular rational function. The results obtained are sharp.
