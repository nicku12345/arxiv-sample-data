The aim of this paper is to find the necessary and sufficient conditions and inclusion relations for Pascal distribution series to be in the classes SP_{p}({\alpha},\b{eta}) and UCV_{p}({\alpha},\b{eta}) of uniformly spirallike functions. Further, we consider properties of a special function related to Pascal distribution series. Several corollaries and consequences of the main results are also considered.
