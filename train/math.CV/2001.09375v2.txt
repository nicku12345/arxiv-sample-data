We investigate boundedness and positivity of the three-point symmetrization of a Cauchy-like kernel K_h that was studied in [4] for arbitrary three-point configurations in \mathbb C, now in the restricted setting where the three points all lie on a curve \Gamma with specified smoothness, and for a specialized choice of the phase function h dictated by the geometry and complex function theory of the domains bounded by \Gamma.
