Let r(z) be a rational function with at most n poles, a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n, where |a_j| > 1, 1\leq j\leq n. This paper investigates the estimate of the modulus of the derivative of a rational function r(z) on the unit circle. We establish an upper bound when all zeros of r(z) lie in |z|\geq k\geq 1 and a lower bound when all zeros of r(z) lie in |z|\leq k \leq 1. In particular, when k=1 and r(z) has exactly n zeros, we obtain a generalization of results by A. Aziz and W. M. Shah [Some refinements of Bernstein-type inequalities for rational functions, Glas. Mat., {\bf 32}(52) (1997), 29--37.].
