A parabolic representation of the free group F_2 is one in which the images of both generators are parabolic elements of PSL(2,\IC). The Riley slice is a closed subset {\cal R}\subset \IC which is a model for the parabolic, discrete and faithful characters of F_2. The complement of the Riley slice is a bounded Jordan domain within which there are isolated points, accumulating only at the boundary, corresponding to parabolic discrete and faithful representations of rigid subgroups of PSL(2,\IC). Recent work of Aimi, Akiyoshi, Lee, Oshika, Parker, Lee, Sakai, Sakuma \& Yoshida, have topologically identified all these groups. Here we give the first identified substantive properties of the nondiscrete representations and prove a supergroup density theorem: given any irreducible parabolic representation \rho_*:F_2\to PSL(2,\IC) whatsoever, any non-discrete parabolic representation \rho_0 has an arbitrarily small perturbation \rho_\epsilon so that \rho_\epsilon(F_2) contains a conjugate of \rho_*(F_2) as a proper subgroup. This implies that if \Gamma_* is any nonelementary group generated by two parabolic elements (discrete or otherwise) and \gamma_0 is any point in the complement of the Riley slice, then in any neighbourhood of \gamma there is a point corresponding to a nonelementary group generated by two parabolics with a conjugate of \Gamma_* as a proper subgroup. Using these ideas we then show that there are nondiscrete parabolic representations with an arbitrarily large number of distinct Nielsen classes of parabolic generators.
