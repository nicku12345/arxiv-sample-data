We study numerical computation of several conformal invariants of simply connected domains in the complex plane including, the hyperbolic distance, the reduced modulus, the harmonic measure, and the modulus of a quadrilateral. The method we use is based on the boundary integral equation with the generalized Neumann kernel. Several numerical examples are presented. We validate the performance and accuracy of our method by considering several model problems with known analytic solutions.
