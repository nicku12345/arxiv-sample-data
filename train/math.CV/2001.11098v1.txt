For univalent and normalized functions f the logarithmic coefficients \gamma_n(f) are determined by the formula \log(f(z)/z)=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}2\gamma_n(f)z^n. In the paper \cite{Pon} the authors posed the conjecture that a locally univalent function in the unit disk, satisfying the condition \[ \Re\left\{1+zf''(z)/f'(z)\right\}<1+\lambda/2\quad (z\in \mathbb{D}), \] fulfill also the following inequality: |\gamma_n(f)|\le \lambda/(2n(n+1)). Here \lambda is a real number such that 0<\lambda\le 1. In the paper we confirm that the conjecture is true, and sharp.
