In this paper, we study the transcendental meromorphic solutions for the nonlinear differential equations: f^{n}+P(f)=R(z)e^{\alpha(z)} and f^{n}+P_{*}(f)=p_{1}(z)e^{\alpha_{1}(z)}+p_{2}(z)e^{\alpha_{2}(z)} in the complex plane, where P(f) and P_{*}(f) are differential polynomials in f of degree n-1 with coefficients being small functions and rational functions respectively, R is a non-vanishing small function of f, \alpha is a nonconstant entire function, p_{1}, p_{2} are non-vanishing rational functions, and \alpha_{1}, \alpha_{2} are nonconstant polynomials. Particularly, we consider the solutions of the second equation when p_{1}, p_{2} are nonzero constants, and \deg \alpha_{1}=\deg \alpha_{2}=1. Our results are improvements and complements of Liao (Complex Var. Elliptic Equ. 2015, 60(6): 748--756), and Rong-Xu (Mathematics 2019, 7, 539), etc., which partially answer a question proposed by Li (J. Math. Anal. Appl. 2011, 375: 310--319).
