We study complex geodesics and complex Monge-Amp\`{e}re equations on bounded strongly linearly convex domains in \mathbb C^n. More specifically, we prove the uniqueness of complex geodesics with prescribed boundary value and direction in such a domain, when its boundary is of minimal regularity. The existence of such complex geodesics was proved by the first author in the early 1990s, but the uniqueness was left open. Based on the existence and the uniqueness proved here, as well as other previously obtained results, we solve a homogeneous complex Monge-Amp\`{e}re equation with prescribed boundary singularity, which was first considered by Bracci et al. on smoothly bounded strongly convex domains in \mathbb C^n.
