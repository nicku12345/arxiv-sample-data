Let A be an n by n matrix with numerical range W(A) := \{ q^{*}Aq : q \in \mathbb{C}^n , ~\| q \|_2 = 1 \}. We are interested in functions \hat{f} that maximize \| f(A) \|_2 (the matrix norm induced by the vector 2-norm) over all functions f that are analytic in the interior of W(A) and continuous on the boundary and satisfy \max_{z \in W(A)} | f(z) | \leq 1. It is known that there are functions \hat{f} that achieve this maximum and that such functions are of the form B\circ\phi, where \phi is any conformal mapping from the interior of W(A) to the unit disk \mathbb{D}, extended to be continuous on the boundary of W(A), and B is a Blaschke product of degree at most n-1. It is not known if a function \hat{f} that achieves this maximum is unique, up to multiplication by a scalar of modulus one. We show that this is the case when A is a 2\times 2 nonnormal matrix or a Jordan block, but we give examples of some 3\times 3 matrices with elliptic numerical range for which two different functions \hat{f}, involving the same conformal mapping but Blaschke products of different degrees, achieve the same maximal value of ||f(A)||_2.
