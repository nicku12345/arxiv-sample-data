On any pure n-dimensional, possibly non-reduced, analytic space X we introduce the sheaves \mathscr{E}_X^{p,q} of smooth (p,q)-forms and certain extensions \mathscr{A}_X^{p,q} of them such that the corresponding Dolbeault complex is exact, i.e., the \bar\partial-equation is locally solvable in \mathscr{A}_X. The sheaves \mathscr{A}_X^{p,q} are modules over the smooth forms, in particular, they are fine sheaves. We also introduce certain sheaves \mathscr{B}_X^{n-p,n-q} of currents on X that are dual to \mathscr{A}_X^{p,q} in the sense of Serre duality. More precisely, we show that the compactly supported Dolbeault cohomology of \mathscr{B}^{n-p,n-q}(X) in a natural way is the dual of the Dolbeault cohomology of \mathscr{A}^{p,q}(X).
