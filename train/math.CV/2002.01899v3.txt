We consider the behavior of generalized Laplacian vector fields on a Jordan domain of \mathbb{R}^{3} with fractal boundary. Our approach is based on properties of the Teodorescu transform and suitable extension of the vector fields. Specifically, the present article addresses the decomposition problem of a H\"older continuous vector field on the boundary (also called reconstruction problem) into the sum of two generalized Laplacian vector fields in the domain and in the complement of its closure, respectively. In addition, conditions on a H\"older continuous vector field on the boundary to be the trace of a generalized Laplacian vector field in the domain are also established.
