For appropriate domains \Omega_{1}, \Omega_{2} we consider mappings \Phi_{\mathbf A}:\Omega_{1}\to\Omega_{2} of monomial type. We obtain an orthogonal decomposition of the Bergman space \mathcal A^{2}(\Omega_{1}) into finitely many closed subspaces indexed by characters of a finite Abelian group associated to the mapping \Phi_{\mathbf A}. We then show that each subspace is isomorphic to a weighted Bergman space on \Omega_{2}. This leads to a formula for the Bergman kernel on \Omega_{1} as a sum of weighted Bergman kernels on \Omega_{2}
