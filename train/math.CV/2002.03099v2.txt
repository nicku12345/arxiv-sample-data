In the present paper, we discuss several basic properties of a class of quasiconformal close-to-convex harmonic mappings with starlike analytic part, such results as coefficient inequalities, an integral representation, a growth theorem, an area theorem, and radii of close-to-convexity of partial sums of the class, are derived.
