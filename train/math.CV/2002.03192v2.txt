This paper continues the investigation of the relation between the geometry of a circle embedding and the values of its Fourier coefficients. First, we answer a question of Kovalev and Yang concerning the support of the Fourier transform of a starlike embedding. An important special case of circle embeddings are homeomorphisms of the circle onto itself. Under a one-sided bound on the Fourier support, such homeomorphisms are rational functions related to Blaschke products. We study the structure of rational circle homeomorphisms and show that they form a connected set in the uniform topology.
