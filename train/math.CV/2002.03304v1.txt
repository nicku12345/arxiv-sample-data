A holomorphic function f on a simply connected domain \Omega belongs to a subclass of universal Taylor series if prescribed and infinite number of partial sums of the Taylor expansion of f around a given center \zeta_0 realize Mergalyan-type approximations outside \Omega. We will prove that this class is independent of the choice of center if the indices of the partial sums do not grow very fast to infinity.
