In this notes we reprove MacPherson's conjecture on L^2-(n,q)-cohomology through Demailly's formulation of H\"ormander's Estimate. This approach allows us to weaken the condition of locally semipositivity in Ruppenthal's L^2-representation of adjoint bundle. Moreover we prove the MacPherson's conjecture of twisted coefficient bundle under an arbitrary singular hermitian metric. As applications, we study the MacPherson type problem for pluri-canonical bundle.
