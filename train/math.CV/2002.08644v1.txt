Let \varphi: D\rightarrow \Omega be a homeomorphism from a circle domain D onto a domain \Omega\subset\hat{\mathbb{C}}. We obtain necessary and sufficient conditions (1) for \varphi to have a continuous extension to the closure \overline{D} and (2) for such an extension to be injective. Further assume that \varphi is conformal and that \partial\Omega has at most countably many non-degenerate components \{P_n\} whose diameters have a finite sum \displaystyle\sum_n{\rm diam}(P_n)<\infty. When the point components of \partial D or those of \partial \Omega form a set of \sigma-finite linear measure, we can show that \varphi continuously extends to \overline{D} if and only if all the components of \partial\Omega are locally connected. This generalizes Carath\'eodory's Continuity Theorem, that concerns the case when D is the open unit disk \left\{z\in\hat{\mathbb{C}}: |z|<1\right\}, and allows us to derive a new generalization of the Osgood-Taylor-Caratheodry Theorem.   Here a Peano compactum is a compact metrisable space with locally connected components such that for any C>0 at most finitely many of its components are of diameter greater than C.
