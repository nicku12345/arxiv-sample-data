We study the (global) Bishop problem for small perturbations of \mathbf{S}^n --- the unit sphere of \mathbb{C}\times\mathbb{R}^{n-1} --- in \mathbb{C}^n. We show that if S\subset\mathbb{C}^n is a sufficiently-small perturbation of \mathbf{S}^n (in the \mathcal{C}^3-norm), then S bounds an (n+1)-dimensional ball M\subset\mathbb{C}^n that is foliated by analytic disks attached to S. Furthermore, if S is either smooth or real analytic, then so is M (upto its boundary). Finally, if S is real analytic (and satisfies a mild condition), then M is both the envelope of holomorphy and the polynomially convex hull of S. This generalizes the previously known case of n=2 (CR singularities are isolated) to higher dimensions (CR singularities are nonisolated).
