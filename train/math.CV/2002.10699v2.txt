A continuous complex-valued function F in a domain D\subseteq\mathbf{C} is Poly-analytic of order \alpha if it satisfies \partial^{\alpha}_{\overline{z}}F=0. One can show that F has the form F(z)={\displaystyle\sum\limits_{0}^{n-1}}\overline{z}^{k}A_{k}(z), where each A_k is an analytic function. In this paper, we prove the existence of a Landau constant for Poly-analytic functions and the special Bi-analytic case. We also establish the Bohr's inequality for poly-analytic and bi-analytic functions which map U into U. In addition, we give an estimate for the arclength over the class of poly-analytic mappings and consider the problem of minimizing moments of order p.
