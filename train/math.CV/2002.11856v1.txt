The group \text{Aut}_{\text{hol}}(\mathbb C^n) of self-biholomorphisms of \mathbb C^n consists of affine maps if n=1, but in higher dimensions it is a large object that has not been described explicitly. Despite the intricacies involved when n>1, surprisingly every F\in \text{Aut}_{\text{hol}}(\mathbb C^n) is uniquely determined inside the group by only two data, of infinitesimal and global nature: the 1-jet of F at 0, and the complex Hessian of a certain plurisubharmonic function associated to F. If n=1 this global datum is zero for all F, which is then determined solely by its 1-jet at 0, and one recovers \text{Aut}_{\text{hol}}(\mathbb C)= \text{Aff}(\mathbb C)\cong \mathbb C \times \mathbb C^{*}. Our main result, formulated as the existence of a canonical embedding of  \text{Aut}_{\text{hol}} ( \mathbb C^n), also singles out a natural candidate for moduli space of  \text{Aut}_{\text{hol}} ( \mathbb C^n), for all n>1.
