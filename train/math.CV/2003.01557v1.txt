In this paper, we study a problem of non-constant entire function  f  that shares a set  \mathcal{S}=\{a,b,c\}  with its  k -th derivative  f^{(k)} , where  a, b  and  c  are any three distinct complex numbers. We have found a gap in the statement of the main result of \textit{Chang-Fang-Zalcman} \cite{Cha & Fan & al-ADM-2007} and with some help of the method used by \textit{Chang-Fang-Zalcman}, we have generalized the result of \textit{Chang-Fang-Zalcman} in a more compact form. As an application, we generalize the famous Br\ddot{u}ck conjecture \cite{Bru-1996} with the idea of set sharing.
