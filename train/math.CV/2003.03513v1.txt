The purpose of this paper is to prove the finiteness theorems for meromorphic mappings of a complete connected K\"{a}hler manifold into projective space sharing few hyperplanes in subgeneral position without counting multiplicity, where all zeros with multiplicities more than a certain number are omitted. Our results are extensions and generalizations of some recent ones.
