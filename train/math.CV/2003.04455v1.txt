In the present paper, we derive several conditions of linear combinations and convolutions of harmonic mappings to be univalent and convex in one direction, one of them gives a partial answer to an open problem proposed by Dorff. The results presented here provide extensions and improvements of those given in some earlier works. Several examples of univalent harmonic mappings convex in one direction are also constructed to demonstrate the main results.
