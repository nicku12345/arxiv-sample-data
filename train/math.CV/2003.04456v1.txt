In this paper, we consider a subclass of starlike functions associated with a vertical strip domain. Several results concerned with integral representations, convolutions, and coefficient inequalities for functions belonging to this class are obtained. Furthermore, we consider radius problems and inclusion relations involving certain classes of strongly starlike functions, parabolic starlike functions and other types of starlike functions. The results are essential improvements of the corresponding results obtained by Kargar et al., and the derivations are similar to those used earlier by Sun et al. and Kwon et al..
