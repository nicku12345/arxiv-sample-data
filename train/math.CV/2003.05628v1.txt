We find the radius of starlikeness of order \alpha, 0\leq \alpha<1, of normalized analytic functions f on the unit disk satisfying either \operatorname{Re}(f(z)/g(z))>0 or \left| (f(z)/g(z))-1\right|<1 for some close-to-star function g with \operatorname{Re}(g(z)/(z+z^2/2))>0 as well as of the class of close-to-star functions f satisfying \operatorname{Re}(f(z)/(z+z^2/2))>0. Several other radii such as radius of univalence and parabolic starlikeness are shown to be the same as the radius of starlikeness of appropriate order.
