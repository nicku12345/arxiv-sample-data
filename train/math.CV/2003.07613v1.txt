Assume that f lies in the class of starlike functions of order \alpha \in [0,1), that is, which are regular and univalent for |z|<1 and such that {\rm Re} \left (\frac{zf'(z)}{f(z)} \right ) > \alpha ~\mbox{ for } |z|<1.  In this paper we show that for each \alpha \in [0,1), the following sharp inequality holds:  |f(re^{i\theta})|^{-1} \int_{0}^{r}|f'(ue^{i\theta})| du \leq \frac{\Gamma (\frac12)\Gamma (2-\alpha )}{\Gamma (\frac32-\alpha )} ~\mbox {for every r<1 and \theta}.  This settles the conjecture of Hall (1980).
