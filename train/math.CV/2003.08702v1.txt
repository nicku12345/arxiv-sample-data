We study the upper and the lower densities of complete and minimal Gabor Gaussians systems. In contrast to the classical lattice case when they are both equal to 1, we prove that the lower density may reach 0 while the upper density may vary at least from \frac{1}{\pi} to e. In the case when the upper density exceeds 1, we establish a sharp inequality relating the upper and the lower densities.
