In this paper, we will give suitable conditions on differential polynomials Q(f) such that they take every finite non-zero value infinitely often, where f is a meromorphic function in complex plane. These results are related to Problem 1.19 and Problem 1.20 in a book of Hayman and Lingham \cite{HL}. As consequences, we give a new proof of the Hayman conjecture. Moreover, our results allow differential polynomials Q(f) to have some terms of any degree of f and also the hypothesis n>k in \cite[Theorem 2]{BE} is replaced by n\ge 2 in our result.
