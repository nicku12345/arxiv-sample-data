Let \mathcal{S} denote the family of all functions that are analytic and univalent in the unit disk \mathbb{D}:=\{z: |z|<1\} and satisfy f(0)=f^{\prime}(0)-1=0. In the present paper, we consider certain subclasses of univalent functions associated with the exponential function, and obtain the sharp upper bounds on the initial coefficients and the difference of initial successive coefficients for functions belonging to these classes.
