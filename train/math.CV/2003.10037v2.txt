A well-known theorem by J. Becker states that if a normalized univalent function f in the unit disk \mathbb{D} can be embedded as the initial element into a Loewner chain (f_t)_{t\geqslant 0} such that the Herglotz function p in the Loewner -- Kufarev PDE \partial f_t(z)/\partial f=zf'_t(z)p(z,t),\qquad z\in\mathbb{D},\quad\mathrm{a.e.}~t\ge0, satisfies \big|(p(z,t)-1)/(p(z,t)+1)\big|\le k<1, then f admits a k-q.c. (="k-quasiconformal") extension F:\mathbb{C}\to\mathbb{C}. The converse is not true. However, a simple argument shows that if f has a q-q.c. extension with q\in(0,1/6), then Becker's condition holds with k:=6q. In this paper we address the following problem: find the largest k_*\in(0,1] with the property that for any q\in(0,k_*) there exists k_0(q)\in(0,1) such that every normalized univalent function f:\mathbb D\to\mathbb C with a q-q.c. extension to \mathbb C satisfies Becker's condition with k:=k_0(q). We prove that k_*\ge1/3.
