We consider a bounded open Stein subset \Omega of a complex Stein manifold X of dimension n. We prove that if f is a current on X of bidegree (p,q+1), \bar\partial-closed on \Omega, we can find a current u on X of bidegree (p,q) which is a solution of the equation \bar\partial u=f in \Omega. In other words, we prove that the Dolbeault complex of temperate currents on \Omega (i.e. currents on \Omega which extend to currents on X) is concentrated in degree 0. Moreover if f is a current on X= C^n of order k, then we can find a solution u which is a current on C^n of order k+2n+1.
