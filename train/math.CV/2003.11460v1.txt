In this paper, we establish some Schwarz type lemmas for mappings \Phi satisfying the inhomogeneous biharmonic Dirichlet problem  \Delta (\Delta(\Phi)) = g in \mathbb{D}, \Phi=f on \mathbb{T} and \partial_n \Phi=h on \mathbb{T}, where g is a continuous function on \overline{\mathbb{D}}, f,h are continuous functions on \mathbb{T}, where \mathbb{D} is the unit disc of the complex plane \mathbb{C} and \mathbb{T}=\partial \mathbb{D} is the unit circle. To reach our aim, we start by investigating some properties of T_2-harmonic functions. Finally, we prove a Landau-type theorem.
