We give a general formula for the C-transfinite diameter \delta_C(K) of a compact set K\subset \mathbb{C}^2 which is a product of univariate compacta where C\subset (\mathbb{R}^+)^2 is a convex body. Along the way we prove a Rumely type formula relating \delta_C(K) and the C-Robin function \rho_{V_{C,K}} of the C-extremal plurisubharmonic function V_{C,K} for C \subset (\mathbb{R}^+)^2 a triangle T_{a,b} with vertices (0,0), (b,0), (0,a). Finally, we show how the definition of \delta_C(K) can be extended to include many nonconvex bodies C\subset \mathbb{R}^d for d-circled sets K\subset \mathbb{C}^d, and we prove an integral formula for \delta_C(K) which we use to compute a formula for the C-transfinite diameter of the Euclidean unit ball \mathbb{B}\subset \mathbb{C}^2.
