The goal of this note is to present some recent results of our research concerning multiplier ideal sheaves on complex spaces and singularities of plurisubharmonic functions. We firstly introduce multiplier ideal sheaves on complex spaces (\emph{not} necessarily normal) via Ohsawa's extension measure, as a special case of which, it turns out to be the so-called Mather-Jacobian multiplier ideals in the algebro-geometric setting. As applications, we obtain a reasonable generalization of (algebraic) adjoint ideal sheaves to the analytic setting and establish some extension theorems on K\"ahler manifolds from \emph{singular} hypersurfaces. Relying on our multiplier and adjoint ideals, we also give characterizations for several important classes of singularities of pairs associated to plurisubharmonic functions.   Moreover, we also investigate the local structure of singularities of log canonical locus of plurisubharmonic functions. Especially, in the three-dimensional case, we show that for any plurisubharmonic function with log canonical singularities, its associated multiplier ideal subscheme is weakly normal, by which we give a complete classification of multiplier ideal subschemes with log canonical singularities.
