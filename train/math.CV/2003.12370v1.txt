We consider a family of analytic and normalized functions that are related to the domains \mathbb{H}(s), with a right branch of a hyperbolas H(s) as a boundary. The hyperbola H(s) is given by the relation \frac{1}{\rho}=\left( 2\cos\frac{\varphi}{s}\right)^s\quad (0<s\le 1,\ |\varphi|<(\pi s)/2). We mainly study a coefficient problem of the families of functions for which zf'/f or 1+zf''/f' map the unit disk onto a subset of \mathbb{H}(s). We find coefficients bounds, solve Fekete-Szeg\"{o} problem and estimate the Hankel determinant.
