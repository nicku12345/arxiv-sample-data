A harmonic mapping is a univalent harmonic function of one complex variable. We define a family of harmonic mappings on the unit disk whose images are rotationally symmetric rosettes with n cusps or n nodes, where n \ge 3. These mappings are analogous to the n-cusped hypocycloid, but are modified by Gauss hypergeometric factors, both in the analytic and co-analytic parts. Relative rotations by an angle \beta of the analytic and anti-analytic parts lead to graphs that have cyclic, and in some cases dihedral symmetry of order n. While the graphs for different \beta can be dissimilar, the cusps are aligned along axes that are independent of \beta. For certain isolated values of \beta, the boundary function is continuous with arcs of constancy, and has nodes of interior angle \pi/2-\pi/n.
