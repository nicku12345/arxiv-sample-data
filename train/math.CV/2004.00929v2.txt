We investigate decay near boundary of the volume of sublevel sets in Cegrell classes of m- subharmonic function on bounded domains in \mathbb C^n. On the reverse direction, some sufficient conditions for membership in certain Cegrell's classes, in terms of the decay of the sublevel sets, are also discussed.
