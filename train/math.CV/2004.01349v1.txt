In this paper, we study the boundedness and compactness of the differences of two weighted composition operators acting from \alpha-Bloch space to \beta-Bloch space on the open unit disk. This study has a relationship to the topological structure of weighted composition from \alpha-Bloch space to \beta-Bloch space.
