In this paper, we study the boundedness and essential norms of the differences of two generalized composition operators acting from \alpha-Bloch space to \beta-Bloch space on the open unit disk. From essential norms, we get the compactness of the differences of two generalized composition operators. This study has a relationship to the topological structure of generalized composition operators acting from \alpha-Bloch space to \beta-Bloch space.
