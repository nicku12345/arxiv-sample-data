We show that the graph of a continuous map f:G \to \mathbb{R}^k_v\times\mathbb{C}^p_\zeta, defined on an open set G in \mathbb{C}^n_z\times\mathbb{R}^k_u, is locally foliated by complex n-dimensional submanifolds if and only if its complement is n-pseudoconvex in (G+i\mathbb{R}^k_v)\times\mathbb{C}^p_\zeta\subset \mathbb{C}^{n}_z\times\mathbb{C}^k_{u+iv}\times\mathbb{C}^p_\zeta (in the sense of Rothstein).
