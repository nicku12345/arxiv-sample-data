Let z_0 and w_0 be given points in the open unit disk \mathbb{D} with |w_0| < |z_0|. Let \mathcal{H}_0 be the class of all analytic self-maps f of \mathbb{D} normalized by f(0)=0, and \mathcal{H}_0 (z_0,w_0) = \{ f \in \mathcal{H}_0 : f(z_0) =w_0\}. In this paper, we explicitly determine the variability region of f''(z_0) when f ranges over \mathcal{H}_0 (z_0,w_0). We also show a geometric view of our main result by Mathematica.
