In \cite{CO-Tp-spaces}, the present authors initiated the study of composition operators on discrete analogue of generalized Hardy space \mathbb{T}_{p} defined on a homogeneous rooted tree. In this article, we give equivalent conditions for the composition operator C_\phi to be bounded on \mathbb{T}_{p} and on \mathbb{T}_{p,0} spaces and compute their operator norm. We also characterize invertible composition operators as well as isometric composition operators on \mathbb{T}_{p} and on \mathbb{T}_{p,0} spaces. Also, we discuss the compactness of C_\phi on \mathbb{T}_{p} and finally prove there are no compact composition operators on \mathbb{T}_{p,0} spaces.
