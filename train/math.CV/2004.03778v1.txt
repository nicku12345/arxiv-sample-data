We relate the moduli space of analytic equivalent germs of reduced quasi-homogeneous functions at (\mathbb{C}^2,0) with their bi-Lipschitz equivalence classes. We show that any non-degenerate continuous family of (reduced) quasi-homogeneous functions with constant Henry-Parusi\'nski invariant is analytically trivial. Further we show that there are only a finite number of distinct bi-Lipschitz classes among quasi-homogeneous functions with the same Henry-Parusi\'nski invariant providing a maximum quota for this number.
