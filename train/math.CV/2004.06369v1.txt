For f\in \mathcal{S}, the class of normalized functions, analytic and univalent in the unit disk \mathbb{D} and given by f(z)=z+\sum_{n=2}^{\infty} a_n z^n for z\in \mathbb{D}, we give an upper bound for the coefficient difference |a_4|-|a_3| when f\in \mathcal{S}. This provides an improved bound in the case n=3 of Grispan's 1976 general bound ||a_{n+1}|-|a_n||\le 3.61\dots . Other coefficients bounds, and bounds for the second and third Hankel determinants when f\in \mathcal{S} are found when either a_2=0, or a_3=0.
