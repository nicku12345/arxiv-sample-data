We show that the spaces of A-m-subharmonic and B-m-subharmonic functions differ in sufficently high dimensions. We also prove that the Monge-Amp\`ere type operator \mathcal M_m associated to the space of m-plurisubharmonic functions does not allow an integral comparison principle except in the classical cases m=1 and m=n. These answer in the negative two problems posed by A. Sadullaev.
