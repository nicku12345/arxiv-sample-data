As contributions to the Ramanujan theory of elliptic functions to alternative bases, Li-Chien Shen has developed families of elliptic functions from the hypergeometric functions F(\tfrac{1}{3}, \tfrac{2}{3}; \tfrac{1}{2} ; \bullet) and F(\tfrac{1}{4}, \tfrac{3}{4}; \tfrac{1}{2} ; \bullet). We apply his methods to the hypergeometric function F(\tfrac{1}{6}, \tfrac{5}{6}; \tfrac{1}{2} ; \bullet).
