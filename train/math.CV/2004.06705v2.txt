Let M be a complete K\"{a}hler manifold, whose universal covering is biholomorphic to a ball \mathbb B^m(R_0) in \mathbb C^m (0<R_0\le +\infty). Our first aim in this paper is to study the algebraic dependence problem of differentiably meromorphic mappings. We will show that if k differentibility nondegenerate meromorphic mappings f^1,\ldots,f^k of M into \mathbb P^n(\mathbb C)\ (n\ge 2) satisfying the condition (C_\rho) and sharing few hyperplanes in subgeneral position regardless of multiplicity then f^1\wedge\cdots\wedge f^k\equiv 0. For the second aim, we will show that there are at most two different differentiably nondegenerate meromorphic mappings of M into \mathbb P^n(\mathbb C) sharing q\ (q\sim 2N-n+3+O(\rho)) hyperplanes in N-subgeneral position regardless of multiplicity. Our results generalize previous finiteness and uniqueness theorems for differentiably meromorphic mappings of \mathbb C^m and extend some previous results for the case of mappings on K\"{a}hler manifold.
