The dynamics of all quadratic Newton maps applied to rational functions is completely described. The Julia set of such a map is found to be either a Jordan curve or totally disconnected. It is proved that no Newton map of degree at least three is conformally conjugate to any polynomial with exactly one finite critical point. However, there are cubic Newton maps which are conformally conjugate to other types of polynomials. The Julia set of such a Newton map is shown to be a closed curve. It is a Jordan curve whenever the Newton map has two attracting fixed points.
