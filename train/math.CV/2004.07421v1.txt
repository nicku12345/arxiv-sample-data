In this paper we introduce a new class of domains -- log-type convex domains, which have no boundary regularity assumptions. Then we will localize the Kobayashi metric in log-type convex subdomains. As an application, we prove a local version of continuous extension of rough isometric maps between two bounded domains with log-type convex Dini-smooth boundary points. Moreover we prove that the Teichm\"uller space \mathcal T_{g,n} is not biholomorphic to any bounded pseudoconvex domain in \mathbb C^{3g-3+n} which is locally log-type convex near some boundary point.
