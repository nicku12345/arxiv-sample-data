Let M be a complete K\"{a}hler manifold, whose universal covering is biholomorphic to a ball \mathbb B^m(R_0) in \mathbb C^m (0<R_0\le +\infty). In this article, we will show that if three meromorphic mappings f^1,f^2,f^3 of M into \mathbb P^n(\mathbb C)\ (n\ge 2) satisfying the condition (C_\rho) and sharing q\ (q> C+\rho K) hyperplanes in general position regardless of multiplicity with certain positive constants K and C <2n (explicitly estimated), then there are some algebraic relation between them. A degeneracy theorem for k\ (2\le k\le n+1) meromorphic mappings sharing hyperplanes is also given. Our result generalize the previous result in the case where the mappings from \mathbb C^m into \mathbb P^n(\mathbb C).
