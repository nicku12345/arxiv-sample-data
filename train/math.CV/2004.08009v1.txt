This paper is a sequel to our previous paper \cite{TS2}. We extend the result on the behavior of the quadratic part of normal forms up to the quadratic part of small \mathcal{C}^{2}-perturbations of real 4-manifolds embedded in a complex 3-manifold. It is an immediate consequence of a result describing a change of the normal form of a pair of one arbitrary and one symmetric 2\times 2 matrix with respect to a certain linear group action.
