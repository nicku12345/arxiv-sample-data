This paper deals with subclasses of bounded analytic functions on the unit disc. It is our aim to connect the smoothness of the boundary function and the mean growth of an appropriate derivative of analytic mapping. We generalize the Yamashita approach for analytic mappings of the unit disc into a bounded plane domain equipped with the Bergman distance or quasihyperbolic distance. The theorems we give are non Euclidean versions of the classical Hardy and Littlewood theorems.
