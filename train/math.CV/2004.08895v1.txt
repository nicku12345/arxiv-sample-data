In this paper we first consider another version of the Rogosinski inequality for analytic functions f(z)=\sum_{n=0}^\infty a_nz^n in the unit disk |z| < 1, in which we replace the coefficients a_n (n= 0,1,\ldots ,N) of the power series by the derivatives f^{(n)}(z)/n! (n= 0,1,\ldots ,N). Secondly, we obtain improved versions of the classical Bohr inequality and Bohr's inequality for the harmonic mappings of the form f = h + \overline{g}, where the analytic part h is bounded by 1 and that |g'(z)| \le k|h'(z)| in |z| < 1 and for some k \in [0,1].
