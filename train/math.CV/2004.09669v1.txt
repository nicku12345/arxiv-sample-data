Given the planar unit disk as the source and a Jordan domain as the target, we study the problem of extending a given boundary homeomorphism as a Sobolev homeomorphism. For general targets, this Sobolev variant of the classical Jordan-Schoenflies theorem may admit no solution - it is possible to have a boundary homeomorphism which admits a continuous W^{1,2}-extension but not even a homeomorphic W^{1,1}-extension. We prove that if the target is assumed to be a John disk, then any boundary homeomorphism from the unit circle admits a Sobolev homeomorphic extension for all exponents p<2. John disks, being one sided quasidisks, are of fundamental importance in Geometric Function Theory.
