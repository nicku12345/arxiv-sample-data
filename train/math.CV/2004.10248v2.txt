We prove the weighted L^p regularity of the ordinary Bergman and Cauchy-Szeg\H{o} projections on strongly pseudoconvex domains D in \mathbb{C}^n with near minimal smoothness for appropriate generalizations of the B_p/A_p classes. In particular, the B_p/A_p Muckenhoupt type condition is expressed relative to balls in a quasi-metric that arises as a space of homogeneous type on either the interior or the boundary of the domain D.
