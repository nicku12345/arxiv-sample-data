In this paper we study sharp estimates of pre-Schwarzian derivatives of functions belonging to the Nehari-type classes by using techniques from differential equations. In the sequel, we also see that a solution of a complex differential equation has a special form in terms of ratio of hypergeometric functions resulting to an integral representation. Finally, we attempt to study those univalent functions in the unit disk for which the image domain is an unbounded John domain.
