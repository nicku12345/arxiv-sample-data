This paper is a continuation of the research of our previous work and considers quaternionic generalized Carath\'eodory functions and the related family of generalized positive functions. It is addressed to a wide audience which includes researchers in complex and hypercomplex analysis, in the theory of linear systems, but also electric engineers. For this reason it includes some results on generalized Carath\'eodory functions and their factorization in the classic complex case which might be of independent interest. An important new result is a pseudo-spectral factorization and we also discuss some interpolation problems in the class of quaternionic generalized positive functions.
