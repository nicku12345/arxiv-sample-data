The theory of strong uniqueness polynomials, satisfying the separation condition (first introduced by Fujimoto \cite{Fuj1}), for complex meromorphic functions is quite complete. We construct examples of strong uniqueness polynomials which do not necessary satisfy the separation condition by constructing regular 1-forms of Wronskian type, a method introduced in \cite{AWW}. We also use this method to produce a much easier proof in establishing the necessary and sufficient conditions for a polynomial, satisfying the separation condition, to be a strong uniqueness polynomials for meromorphic functions and rational functions.
