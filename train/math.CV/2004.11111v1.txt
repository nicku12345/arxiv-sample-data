Given a closed positive current T on a compact Kahler manifold X, we introduce the notion of non-pluripolar product relative to T of closed positive (1,1)-currents. We recover the well-known non-pluripolar product when T is the current of integration along X. Our main results are a monotonicity property of relative non-pluripolar products, a necessary condition for currents to be of relative full mass intersection in terms of Lelong numbers, and the convexity of weighted classes of currents of relative full mass intersection. The former two results are new even when T is the current of integration along X.
