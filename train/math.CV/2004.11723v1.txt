Let u\not\equiv -\infty be a subharmonic function on the complex plane \mathbb C. In 2016, we obtained a result on the existence of an entire function f\neq 0 satisfying the estimate \log|f|\leq {\sf B}_u on \mathbb C, where functions {\sf B}_u are integral averages of u for rapidly shrinking disks as it approaches infinity. We give another equivalent version of this result with \log |f|\leq u outside a very small exceptional set if u is of finite order.
