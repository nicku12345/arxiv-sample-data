We develop a theory of pointwise wedge products of vector-valued functions on the circle and the disc, and obtain results which give rise to a new approach to the analysis of the matricial Nehari problem. We investigate properties of pointwise creation operators and pointwise orthogonal complements in the context of operator theory and the study of vector-valued analytic functions on the unit disc.
