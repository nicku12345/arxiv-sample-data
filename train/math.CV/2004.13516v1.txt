We classify polynomial models for real hypersurfaces in \mathbb C^N, which admit nonlinearizable infinitesimal CR automorphisms. As a consequence, this provides an optimal 1-jet determination result in the general case. Further we prove that such automorphisms arise from one common source, by pulling back via a holomorphic mapping a suitable symmetry of a hyperquadric in some complex space.
