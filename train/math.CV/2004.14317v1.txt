We study open-closed discrete mappings that satisfy the weighted estimate of the distortion of modulus of families of paths. It is proved that the mappings mentioned above have a continuous extension into the isolated point of the boundary, provided that the corresponding weight function is integrable, and the cluster set of the mapping at a given point belongs to the boundary of the image under the mapping
