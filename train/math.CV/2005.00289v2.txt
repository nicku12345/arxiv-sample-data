We study the action of the automorphism group of the 2 complex dimensional manifold symmetrized bidisc \mathbb{G} on itself. The automorphism group is 3 real dimensional. It foliates \mathbb{G} into leaves all of which are 3 real dimensional hypersurfaces except one, viz., the royal variety. This leads us to investigate Isaev's classification of all Kobayashi-hyperbolic 2 complex dimensional manifolds for which the group of holomorphic automorphisms has real dimension 3 studied by Isaev. Indeed, we produce a biholomorphism between the symmetrized bidisc and the domain   \[\{(z_1,z_2)\in \mathbb{C} ^2 : 1+|z_1|^2-|z_2|^2>|1+ z_1 ^2 -z_2 ^2|, Im(z_1 (1+\overline{z_2}))>0\}\] in Isaev's list. Isaev calls it \mathcal D_1. The road to the biholomorphism is paved with various geometric insights about \mathbb{G}. Several consequences of the biholomorphism follow including two new characterizations of the symmetrized bidisc and several new characterizations of \mathcal D_1. Among the results on \mathcal D_1, of particular interest is the fact that \mathcal D_1 is a "symmetrization". When we symmetrize (appropriately defined in the context in the last section) either \Omega_1 or \mathcal{D}^{(2)}_1 (Isaev's notation), we get \mathcal D_1. These two domains \Omega_1 and \mathcal{D}^{(2)}_1 are in Isaev's list and he mentioned that these are biholomorphic to \mathbb{D} \times \mathbb{D}. We produce explicit biholomorphisms between these domains and \mathbb{D} \times \mathbb{D}.
