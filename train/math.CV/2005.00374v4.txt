In this paper, we exhibit the equivalence between different notions of unique range sets, namely, unique range sets, weighted unique range sets and weak-weighted unique range sets under certain conditions.\par Also, we present some uniqueness theorems which show how two meromorphic functions are uniquely determined by their two finite shared sets. Moreover, in the last section, we make some observations that help us to construct other new classes of unique range sets.
