In this paper, four parameters Wright function is considered. Certain geometric properties such as starlikeness, convexity, uniform convexity and close-to-convexity are discussed for this function. Geometric properties of the partial sums of this function are also derived. Further, certain geometric properties of normalized Bessel function of the first kind and two parameters Wright function are studied as a consequence. Interesting corollaries and examples are provided to support that these results are better than the existing ones and improve several results available in the literature.
