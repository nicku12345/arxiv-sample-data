We study the behavior of the boundary function of a harmonic mapping from global and local points of view. Results related to the Koebe lemma are proved, as well as a generalization of a boundary behavior theorem by Bshouty, Lyzzaik and Weitsman. We also discuss this result from a different point of view, from which a relation between the boundary behavior of the dilatation at a boundary point and the continuity of the boundary function of our mapping can be seen.
