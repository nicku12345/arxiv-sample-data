In this paper we establish Gehring-Hayman type theorems for some complex domains. Suppose that \Omega\subset \mathbb{C}^n is a bounded m-convex domain with Dini-smooth boundary, or a bounded strongly pseudoconvex domain with C^2-smooth boundary. Then we prove that the Euclidean length of Kobayashi geodesic [x,y] in \Omega is less than c_1|x-y|^{c_2}. Furthermore, if \Omega endowed with the Kobayashi metric is Gromov hyperbolic, then we can generalize this result to quasi-geodesics with respect to Bergman metric, Carath\'{e}odory metric or K\"{a}hler-Einstein metric.   As applications, we prove the bi-H\"{o}lder equivalence between the Euclidean boundary and the Gromov boundary. Moreover, by using this boundary correspondence, we can show some extension results for biholomorphisms, and more general rough quasi-isometries with respect to the Kobayashi metrics between the domains.
