With the help of the notion of weighted sharing of sets, this paper dealt with the question posed by \emph{Yi} \cite{Yi-SC-1994} regarding the uniqueness of meromorphic functions concerning three set sharing. A result has been proved which significantly improved the recent results of {Banerjee - Ahamed} [Bull. Polish Acad. Sci., {62}(3)(2014), 243--256.], \{Banerjee - Mukherjee} [Hokkaido Math. J., {37}(2008), 507--530.] and {Banerjee - Majumder} [Analysis, {34}(2)(2014), 143--162.] by relaxing the nature of sharing. Several examples have been exhibited to show the sharpness of the cardinalities of the sets {S}_1 and {S}_2 considered in Theorem 1.1. Moreover, we give some constructive examples to endorse the validity of our established theorem.
