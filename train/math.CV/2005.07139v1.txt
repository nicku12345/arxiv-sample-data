The main object of the present paper is to, introduce the. class of meromorphic univalent functions Involving! hypergeomatrc function .We obtain~ some interesting geometric properties according to coefficient inequality , growth and distortion theorems , radii of starlikeness and convexity for the" functions in our subclass.
