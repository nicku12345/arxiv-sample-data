In this study, a subclass of an univalent function with negative coefficients which is defined by a new general Linear operator have been introduced. The sharp results for coefficients estimators, distortion and closure bounds, Hadamard product, and Neighborhood, and this paper deals with the utilizing of many of the results for classical hypergeometric function, where there can be generalized to m-hypergeometric functions. A subclasses of univalent functions are presented, and it has involving operator which generalizes many well-known. Denote A the class of functions f and we have other results have been studied.
