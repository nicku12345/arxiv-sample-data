Let z_0 and w_0 be given points in the open unit disk \mathbb{D} with |w_0| < |z_0|, and \mathcal{H}_0 be the class of all analytic self-maps f of \mathbb{D} normalized by f(0)=0. In this paper, we establish the third order Dieudonn\'e Lemma, and apply it to explicitly determine the variability region \{f'''(z_0): f\in \mathcal{H}_0,f(z_0) =w_0, f'(z_0)=w_1\} for given z_0,w_0,w_1 and give the form of all the extremal functions.
