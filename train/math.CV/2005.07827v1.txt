This paper is devoted to study a fundamental system of equations in plane Linear Elasticity Theory, the two-dimensional Lam\'e-Navier system. We rewrite them in a compressed form in terms of the Cauchy-Riemann operators and it allows us to solve a kind of Riemann problem for this system. A generalized Teodorescu operator, to be introduced here, provides the means for obtaining the explicit solution of this problem for a very wide classes of regions, including those with a fractal boundary.
