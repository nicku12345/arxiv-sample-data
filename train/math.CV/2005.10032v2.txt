The purpose of this paper is to study the Schwarz-Pick type inequalities for harmonic or pluriharmonic functions. By analogy with the generalized Khavinson conjecture, we first give some sharp estimates of the norm of harmonic functions from the Euclidean unit ball in \mathbb{R}^n into the unit ball of the real Minkowski space. Next, we give several sharp Schwarz-Pick type inequalities for pluriharmonic functions from the Euclidean unit ball in \mathbb{C}^n or from the unit polydisc in \mathbb{C}^n into the unit ball of the Minkowski space. Furthermore, we establish some sharp coefficient type Schwarz-Pick inequalities for pluriharmonic functions defined in the Minkowski space. Finally, we use the obtained Schwarz-Pick type inequalities to discuss the Lipschitz continuity, the Schwarz-Pick type lemmas of arbitrary order and the Bohr phenomenon of harmonic or pluriharmonic functions.
