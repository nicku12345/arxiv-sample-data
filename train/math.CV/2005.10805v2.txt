This paper studies the uniqueness of two non-integral finite ordered meromorphic functions with finitely many poles when they share two finite sets. Also, studies an answer to a question posed by Gross for a particular class of meromorphic functions. Moreover, some observations are made on some results due to Sahoo and Karmakar ( Acta Univ. Sapientiae, Mathematica, DOI: 10.2478/ausm-2018-0025) and Sahoo and Sarkar (Bol. Soc. Mat. Mex., DOI: 10.1007/s40590-019-00260-4).
