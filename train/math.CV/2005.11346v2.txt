We study, for the first time, the maximum modulus set of a quasiregular map. It is easy to see that these sets are necessarily closed, and contain at least one point of each modulus. Blumenthal showed that for entire maps these sets are either the whole plane, or a countable union of analytic curves. We show that in the quasiregular case, by way of contrast, any closed set containing at least one point of each modulus can be attained as the maximum modulus set of a quasiregular map. These examples are all of polynomial type. We also show that, subject to an additional constraint, such sets can even be attained by quasiregular maps of transcendental type.
