We construct holomorphically varying families of Fatou-Bieberbach domains with given centres in the complement of any compact polynomially convex subset K of \mathbb C^n for n>1. This provides a simple proof of the recent result of Yuta Kusakabe to the effect that the complement \mathbb C^n\setminus K of any polynomially convex subset K of \mathbb C^n is an Oka manifold. The analogous result is obtained with \mathbb C^n replaced by any Stein manifold with the density property.
