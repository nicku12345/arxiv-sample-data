Let f be a transcendental entire function. For n \in \mathbb{N}, let  f^{n} denote the n^{th} iterate of f. Let  I(f) = \{z \in \mathbb{C} : f^n \rightarrow \infty  as  n \rightarrow \infty \}  and  K(f) = \{z: \textrm{ there exists } R > 0 \textrm{ such that } | f^n(z) | \leq R \textrm{ for } n \geq 0 \}.  Then the set  \mathbb{C}\ \setminus (I(f) \cup K(f))  denoted by  BU(f)  is called Bungee set of f. In this paper we give an alternate definition for  BU(f) which is very easy to work with, and we illustrate it by proving some properties of Bungee sets of composite transcendental entire functions and also of Bungee sets of permutable transcendental entire functions.
