For a given ring (domain) in \overline{\mathbb{R}}^n we discuss whether its boundary components can be separated by an annular ring with modulus nearly equal to that of the given ring. In particular, we show that, for all n\ge 3\,, the standard definition of uniformly perfect sets in terms of Euclidean metric is equivalent to the boundedness of moduli of separating rings. We also establish separation theorems for a "half" of a ring. As applications of those results, we will prove boundary H\"older continuity of quasiconformal mappings of the ball or the half space in \mathbb{R}^n.
