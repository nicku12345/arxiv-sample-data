This paper deals with a special type of non-Ma-Minda function, introduced here with many fascinating facts and interesting applications. It is much akin in all aspects but differs by a condition from its Ma-Minda counterpart. Further, we consider the function: 1-log(1+z), a non-Ma-Minda of the type introduced here, to define a subclass of starlike functions in a similar fashion as we do with Ma-Minda function and is studied for establishing inclusion and radius results. Apart from that, we also deal with the majorization and Bloch function norm problems for the same class. In addition, we obtain the bounds of fourth coefficient: a_4 and second Hankel determinant: H_2(2) for the functions belonging to a newly defined class using convolution, which generalizes many earlier known results and its association with the non-Ma-Minda function is also pointed out.
