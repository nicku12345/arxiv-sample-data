We show that if a reproducing kernel Hilbert space H_K, consisting of functions defined on {\bf E}, enjoys Double Boundary Vanishing Condition (DBVC) and Linear Independent Condition (LIC), then for any preset natural number n, and any function f\in H_K, there exists a set of n parameterized multiple kernels {\tilde{K}}_{w_1},\cdots,{\tilde{K}}_{w_n}, w_k\in {\bf E}, k=1,\cdots,n, and real (or complex) constants c_1,\cdots,c_n, giving rise to a solution of the optimization problem   \[ \|f-\sum_{k=1}^n c_k{\tilde{K}}_{w_k}\|=\inf \{\|f-\sum_{k=1}^n d_k{\tilde{K}}_{v_k}\|\ |\ v_k\in {\bf E}, d_k\in {\bf R}\ ({\rm or}\ {\bf C}), k=1,\cdots,n\}.\]   By applying the theorem of this paper we show that the Hardy space and the Bergman space, as well as all the weighted Bergman spaces in the unit disc all possess n-best approximations. In the Hardy space case this gives a new proof of a classical result. Based on the obtained results we further prove existence of n-best spherical Poisson kernel approximation to functions of finite energy on the real-spheres.
