Recently, there has been a number of good deal of research on the Bohr's phenomenon in various setting including a refined formulation of his classical version of the inequality. Among them, in \cite{PaulPopeSingh-02-10} the authors considered the cases in which the above functions have a multiple zero at the origin. In this article, we present a refined version of Bohr's inequality for these cases and give a partial answer to a question from \cite{PaulPopeSingh-02-10} for the revised setting.
