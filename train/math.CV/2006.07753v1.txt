We introduce a new definition of pre-Schwarzian derivative for logharmonic mappings and basic properties such as the chain rule, multiplicative invariance and affine invariance are proved for these operators. It is shown that the pre-Schwarzain is stable only with respect to rotations of the identity. A characterization is given for the case when the pre-Schwarzian derivative is holomorphic.
