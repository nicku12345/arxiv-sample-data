Let \mathcal{A} denote the class of analytic functions in the unit disk \mathbb{D} of the form f(z)= z+\sum_{n=2}^{\infty}a_n z^n and \mathcal{S} denote the class of functions f\in\mathcal{A} which are univalent ({\it i.e.}, one-to-one). In 1960s, L. Zalcman conjectured that |a_n^2-a_{2n-1}|\le (n-1)^2 for n\ge 2, which implies the famous Bieberbach conjecture |a_n|\le n for n\ge 2. For f\in \mathcal{S}, Ma \cite{Ma-1999} proposed a generalized Zalcman conjecture |a_{n}a_{m}-a_{n+m-1}|\le (n-1)(m-1)  for n\ge 2, m\ge 2. Let \mathcal{U} be the class of functions f\in\mathcal{A} satisfying  \left|f'(z)\left(\frac{z}{f(z)}\right)^2-1 \right|< 1 \quad\mbox{ for } z\in\mathbb{D}.  and \mathcal{F} denote the class of functions f\in \mathcal{A} satisfying {\rm Re\,}(1-z)^{2}f'(z)>0 in \mathbb{D}. In the present paper, we prove the Zalcman conjecture and generalized Zalcman conjecture for the class \mathcal{U} using extreme point theory. We also prove the Zalcman conjecture and generalized Zalcman conjecture for the class \mathcal{F} for the initial coefficients.
