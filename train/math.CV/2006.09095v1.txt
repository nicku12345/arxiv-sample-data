This paper is a continuation of authors work: Fatou and Julia like sets,Ukranian J. Math., to appear/arXiv:2006.08308[math.CV](see [4]). Here, we introduce escaping like set and generalized escaping like set for a family of holomorphic functions on an arbitrary domain, and establish some distinctive properties of these sets. The connectedness of the Julia like set is also proved.
