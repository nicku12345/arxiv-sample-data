In the setting of quaternionic Heisenberg group \mathscr H^{n-1}, we characterize the boundedness and compactness of commutator [b,\mathcal C] for the Cauchy--Szeg\"o operator \mathcal C on the weighted Morrey space L_w^{p,\,\kappa}(\mathscr H^{n-1}) with p\in(1, \infty), \kappa\in(0, 1) and w\in A_p(\mathscr H^{n-1}). More precisely, we prove that [b,\mathcal C] is bounded on L_w^{p,\,\kappa}(\mathscr H^{n-1}) if and only if b\in {\rm BMO}(\mathscr H^{n-1}). And [b,\mathcal C] is compact on L_w^{p,\,\kappa}(\mathscr H^{n-1}) if and only if b\in {\rm VMO}(\mathscr H^{n-1}).
