The Bohr phenomenon for analytic functions of the form f(z)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} a_{n}z^{n}, first introduced by Harald Bohr in 1914, deals with finding the largest radius   r_{f}, 0<r_{f}<1, such that the inequality \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} |a_{n}z^{n}| \leq 1 holds whenever the inequality |f(z)|\leq 1  holds in the unit disk   \mathbb{D}=\{z \in \mathbb{C}: |z|<1\}. The exact value of this largest radius known as Bohr radius, which has been established to be r_{f}=1/3. The Bohr phenomenon \cite{Abu-2010} for harmonic functions f of the form f(z)=h(z)+\overline {g(z)}, where h(z)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} a_{n}z^{n} and g(z)=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} b_{n}z^{n} is to find the largest radius r_{f}, 0<r_{f}<1 such that \sum\limits_{n=1}^{\infty} (|a_{n}|+|b_{n}|) |z|^{n}\leq d(f(0),\partial f(\mathbb{D})) %\quad\mbox { for } |z|\leq r_{f}.  holds for |z|\leq r_{f}, here d(f(0),\partial f(\mathbb{D}))  denotes the Euclidean distance between f(0) and the boundary of f(\mathbb{D}). In this paper, we investigate the Bohr radius for several classes of harmonic functions in the unit disk \mathbb{D}.
