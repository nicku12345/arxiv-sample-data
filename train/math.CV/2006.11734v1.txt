Let f and g be analytic functions on the open unit disk of the complex plane with f/g belonging to the class \mathcal{P}  of functions with positive real part consisting of functions p with p(0)=1 and \operatorname{Re} p(z)>0 or to its subclass consisting of functions p with |p(z)-1|<1. We obtain the sharp radius constants for the function f to be starlike of order \alpha, parabolic starlike, etc. when g/k\in\mathcal{P} where k denotes the Koebe function defined by k(z)=z/(1-z)^2.
