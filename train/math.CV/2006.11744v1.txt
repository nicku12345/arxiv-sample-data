We consider normalized analytic function f on the open unit disk for which either \operatorname{Re} f(z)/g(z)>0, |f(z) /g(z) - 1|<1 or \operatorname{Re} (1-z^2) f(z) /z>0 for some analytic function g with \operatorname{Re} (1-z^2) g(z) /z>0. We have obtained the radii for these functions to belong to various subclasses of starlike functions. The subclasses considered include the classes of starlike functions of order \alpha, lemniscate starlike functions and parabolic starlike functions.
