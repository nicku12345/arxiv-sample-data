We study so-called Martio's mappings, id est, quasiregular mappings f : \Omega \to \mathbb{R}^n \quad \text{(\Omega \to \mathbb{R}^n domain with n \ge 2)} for which the inner dilatation is less than the topological inf-index of the points in the branch set. In dimension n \ge 3 we prove that these mappings are local homeomorphisms under the additional assumption 1/J_f \in L_{loc}^q(\Omega) \quad \text{for some q > q_0}, where the critical exponent q_0>0 depends on the dimension of the space and the ratio between the inner dilatation and the topological inf-index of the branch points. Moreover, we give an analogous sharp result in the planar case. We also show that every branch point of a Martio's mapping is a Lebesgue point for the differential matrix of the mapping.
