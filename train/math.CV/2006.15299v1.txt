We say that a class \mathcal{F} consisting of analytic functions f(z)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} a_{n}z^{n} in the unit disk \mathbb{D}:=\{z\in \mathbb{C}: |z|<1\} satisfies a Bohr phenomenon if there exists r_{f} \in (0,1) such that    \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} |a_{n}z^{n}|\leq d(f(0),\partial f(\mathbb{D}))  for every function f \in \mathcal{F} and |z|=r\leq r_{f}, where d is the Euclidean distance. The largest radius r_{f} is the Bohr radius for the class \mathcal{F}. In this paper, we establish the Bohr phenomenon for the classes consisting of Ma-Minda type starlike functions and Ma-Minda type convex functions as well as for the class of starlike functions with respect to a boundary point.
