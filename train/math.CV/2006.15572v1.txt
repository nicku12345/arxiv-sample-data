We continue our study on variability regions in \cite{Ali-Vasudevarao-Yanagihara-2018}, where the authors determined the region of variability V_\Omega^j (z_0, c ) = \{ \int_0^{z_0} z^{j}(g(z)-g(0))\, d z : g({\mathbb D}) \subset \Omega, \; (P^{-1} \circ g) (z) = c_0 +c_1z + \cdots + c_n z^n + \cdots \} for each fixed z_0 \in {\mathbb D}, j=-1,0,1,2, \ldots and c = (c_0, c_1 , \ldots , c_n) \in \mathbb{C}^{n+1}, when \Omega\subsetneq\mathbb{C} is a convex domain, and P is a conformal map of the unit disk {\mathbb D} onto \Omega. In the present article, we first show that in the case n=0, j=-1 and c=0, the result obtained in \cite{Ali-Vasudevarao-Yanagihara-2018} still holds when one assumes only that \Omega is starlike with respect to P(0). Let \mathcal{CV}(\Omega) be the class of analytic functions f in {\mathbb D} with f(0)=f'(0)-1=0 satisfying 1+zf''(z)/f'(z) \in {\Omega}. As applications we determine variability regions of \log f'(z_0) when f ranges over \mathcal{CV}(\Omega) with or without the conditions f''(0)= \lambda and f'''(0)= \mu. Here \lambda and \mu are arbitrarily preassigned values. By choosing particular \Omega, we obtain the precise variability regions of \log f'(z_0) for other well-known subclasses of analytic and univalent functions.
