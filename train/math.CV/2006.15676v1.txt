The \Pi-operator, also known as Ahlfors-Beurling transform, plays an important role in solving the existence of locally quasiconformal solutions of Beltrami equations. In this paper, we first construct the \Pi-operator on a general Clifford-Hilbert module. This \Pi-operator is also an L^2 isometry. Further, it can also be used for solving certain Beltrami equations when the Hilbert space is the L^2 space of a measure space. Then, we show that this technique can be applied to construct the classical \Pi-operator in the complex plane and some other examples on some conformally flat manifolds, which are constructed by U/\Gamma, where U is a simply connected subdomain of either \mathbb{R}^{n} or \mathbb{S}^{n}, and \Gamma is a Kleinian group acting discontinuously on U. The \Pi-operators on those manifolds also preserve the isometry property in certain L^2 spaces, and their L^p norms are bounded by the L^p norms of the \Pi-operators on \mathbb{R}^{n} or \mathbb{S}^{n}, depending on where U lies. The applications of the \Pi-operator to solutions of the Beltrami equations on those conformally flat manifolds are also discussed. At the end, we investigate the \Pi-operator theory in the upper-half space with the hyperbolic metric.
