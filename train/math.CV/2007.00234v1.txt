Our main result introduces a new way to characterize two-dimensional finite ball quotients by algebraicity of their Bergman kernels. This characterization is particular to dimension two and fails in higher dimensions, as is illustrated by a counterexample in dimension three constructed in this paper. As a corollary of our main theorem, we prove, e.g., that a smoothly bounded strictly pseudoconvex domain G in \mathbb{C}^2 has rational Bergman kernel if and only if there is a rational biholomorphism from G to the 2-dimensional unit ball.
