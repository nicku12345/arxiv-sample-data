This is a survey talk on the ICMS conference "Resonances of complex dynamics", 9-13 July 2018. Three examples which show how dynamical considerations lead to new results in complex function theory are discussed. These examples are: a) a refinement of of the Wiman-Valiron method, b) the proof of Hayman's conjecture on the value distribution of derivatives of meromorphic functions, and c) a new simplified proof of the result of Lin and Wang on the number of critical points of the Green function on a torus.
