A starlike function f is characterized by the quantity zf'(z)/f(z) lying in the right half-plane. This paper deals with sharp bounds for certain symmetric Toeplitz determinants whose entries are the coefficients of the functions f for which the quantity zf'(z)/f(z) takes values in certain specific subset in the right half-plane. The results obtained include several new special cases and some known results.
