Let p be an analytic function defined on the open unit disc \mathbb{D} with p(0)=1 and 0< \alpha \leq 1. The conditions on complex valued functions C, D and E are obtained for p to be subordinate to ((1+z)/(1-z))^{\alpha} when C(z) z^{2}p''(z)+D(z)zp'(z) + E(z)p(z)=0. Sufficient conditions for confluent (Kummer) hypergeometric function and generalized and normalized Bessel function of the first kind of complex order to be subordinate to ((1+z)/(1-z))^{\alpha} are obtained as applications. The conditions on \alpha and \beta are derived for p to be subordinate to ((1+z)/(1-z))^{\alpha} when 1+\beta zp'(z)/p^{n}(z) with n=1,2 is subordinate to 1+4z/3+2z^{2}/3=:\varphi_{CAR}(z). Similar problems were investigated for \RE p(z)>0 when the functions p(z)+\beta zp'(z)/p^{n}(z) with n=0,2 is subordinate to \varphi_{CAR}(z). The condition on \beta is determined for p to be subordinate to ((1+z)/(1-z))^{\alpha} when p(z)+\beta zp'(z)/p^{n}(z) with n=0,1,2 is subordinate to ((1+z)/(1-z))^{\alpha}.
