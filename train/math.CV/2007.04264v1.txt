Let \Omega=\{r<0\}\subset\mathbb C^2, with r plurisubharmonic on b\Omega=\{r=0\}. Let \rho be another defining function for \Omega. A formula for the determinant of the complex Hessian of \rho in terms of r is computed. This formula is used to give necessary and sufficient conditions that make \rho (locally) plurisubharmonic.   As a consequence, if \Omega admits a defining function plurisubharmonic on b\Omega and all weakly pseudoconvex of b\Omega have the same D'Angelo 1-type, then \Omega admits a plurisubharmonic defining function.
