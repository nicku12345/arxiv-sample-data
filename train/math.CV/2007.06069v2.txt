We deal with different kinds of generalizations of \mathcal{S}^*(\psi), the class of Ma-Minda starlike functions, in addition to a majorization result of \mathcal{C}(\psi), the class of Ma-Minda convex functions, which are enlisted as follows: 1. Let h be an analytic function, f be in \mathcal{C}(\psi) and h be majorized by f in the unit disk \mathbb{D}, then for a given \psi, we derive a general equation, which yields the radius constant r_{\psi} such that |h'(z)|\leq |f'(z)| in |z|\leq r_{\psi}. Consequently, obtain results associating \mathcal{S}^*(\psi) and others. 2. We find the largest radius r_0 so that the product function g(z)h(z)/z belongs to a desired class for |z|<r_0 whenever g\in \mathcal{S}^*(\psi_1) and h\in \mathcal{S}^*(\psi_2). Also we obtain a condition for the functions to be in \mathcal{S}^*(\psi) 3. We obtain the modified distortion theorem for \mathcal{S}^*(\psi) with a general perspective. 4. For a fixed f\in \mathcal{S}^*(\psi), the class of subordinants S_{f}(\psi):= \{g : g\prec f \}  is introduced and studied for the Bohr-phenomenon and a couple of conjectures are also proposed.
