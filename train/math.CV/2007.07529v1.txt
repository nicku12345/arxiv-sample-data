We study the maximum modulus set, \mathcal{M}(p), of a polynomial p. We are interested in constructing p so that \mathcal{M}(p) has certain exceptional features. Jassim and London gave a cubic polynomial p such that \mathcal{M}(p) has one discontinuity, and Tyler found a quintic polynomial \tilde{p} such that \mathcal{M}(\tilde{p}) has one singleton component. These are the only results of this type, and we strengthen them considerably. In particular, given a finite sequence a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n of distinct positive real numbers, we construct polynomials p and \tilde{p} such that \mathcal{M}(p) has discontinuities of modulus a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n, and \mathcal{M}(\tilde{p}) has singleton components at the points a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n.   Finally we show that these results are strong, in the sense that it is not possible for a polynomial to have infinitely many discontinuities in its maximum modulus set.
