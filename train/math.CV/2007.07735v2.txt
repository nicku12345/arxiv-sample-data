In this article we examine stretching and rotation of planar quasiconformal mappings on a line. We show that for the for almost every point on the line the set of complex stretching exponents is contained in the disk  \overline{B}(1/(1-k^4),k^2/(1-k^4)), yielding a quadratic improvement in comparison to the known optimal estimate on a general set with Hausdorff dimension 1. Our proof is based on holomorphic motions and known dimension estimates for quasicircles. In addition we establish a lower bound for the dimension of the quasiconformal image of a 1-dimensional subset of a line.
