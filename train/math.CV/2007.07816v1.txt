We study the following class of starlike functions \mathcal{S}^*_{\wp}:=\left\{f\in\mathcal{A}: {zf'(z)}/{f(z)}\prec\ 1+ze^z=:\wp(z) \right\}, that are associated with the cardioid domain \wp(\mathbb{D}), by deriving certain convolution results, radius problems, majorization result, radius problems in terms of coefficients and differential subordination implications. Consequently, we establish some interesting generalizations of our results for the Ma-Minda class of starlike functions \mathcal{S}^{*}(\psi). We also provide, the set of extremal functions maximizing \Re\Phi\left(\log{(f(z)/z)}\right) or \left|\Phi\left(\log{(f(z)/z)}\right)\right| for functions in \mathcal{S}^{*}(\psi), where \Phi is a non-constant entire function. Further T. H. MacGregor's result for the class \mathcal{S}^{*}(\alpha) and \mathcal{S}^*_{\wp} are obtained as special case to our result.
