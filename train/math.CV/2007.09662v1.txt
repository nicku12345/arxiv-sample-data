The Bohr radius for a class \mathcal{G} consisting of analytic functions f(z)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}a_nz^n in unit disc \mathbb{D}=\{z\in\mathbb{C}:|z|<1\} is the largest r^* such that every function f in the class \mathcal{G} satisfies the inequality \begin{equation*} d\left(\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}|a_nz^n|, |f(0)|\right) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}|a_nz^n|\leq d(f(0), \partial f(\mathbb{D})) \end{equation*} for all |z|=r \leq r^*, where d is the Euclidean distance. In this paper, our aim is to determine the Bohr radius for the classes of analytic functions f satisfying differential subordination relations zf'(z)/f(z) \prec h(z) and f(z)+\beta z f'(z)+\gamma z^2 f''(z)\prec h(z), where h is the Janowski function. Analogous results are obtained for the classes of \alpha-convex functions and typically real functions, respectively. All obtained results are sharp.
