Let \phi be a normalized convex function defined on open unit disk \mathbb{D}. For a unified class of normalized analytic functions which satisfy the second order differential subordination f'(z)+ \alpha z f''(z) \prec \phi(z) for all z\in \mathbb{D}, we investigate the distortion theorem and growth theorem. Further, the bounds on initial logarithmic coefficients, inverse coefficient and the second Hankel determinant involving the inverse coefficients are examined.
