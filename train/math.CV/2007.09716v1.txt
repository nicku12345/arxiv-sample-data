Let {\mathcal A} be the class of functions analytic in the unit disk {\mathbb D} := \{ z\in {\mathbb C}:\, |z| < 1 \} and normalized such that f(z)=z+a_2z^2+a_3z^3+\cdots. In this paper we study the class \mathcal{U}(\lambda), 0<\lambda \leq1, consisting of functions f from {\mathcal{A}} satisfying \[\left|\left(\frac{z}{f(z)}\right)^2f'(z)-1\right| < \lambda \quad (z\in {\mathbb D}).\] and give results regarding the Zalcman Conjecture, the generalised Zalcman conjecture, the Krushkal inequality and the second and third order Hankel determinant.
