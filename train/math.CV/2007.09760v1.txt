A finite Blaschke product, restricted to the unit circle, is a smooth covering map. The maximum and minimum values of the derivative of this map reflect the geometry of the Blaschke product. We identify two classes of extremal Blaschke products: those that maximize the difference between the maximum and minimum of the derivative, and those that minimize it. Both classes turn out to have the same algebraic structure, being the quotient of two hypergeometric polynomials.
