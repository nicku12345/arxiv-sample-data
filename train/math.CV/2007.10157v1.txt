In this paper we study the boundedness and compactness characterizations of the commutator of Cauchy type integrals \mathcal C on a bounded strongly pseudoconvex domain D in C^n with boundary bD satisfying the minimum regularity condition C^{2} based on the recent result of Lanzani-Stein and Duong-Lacey-Li-Wick-Wu. We point out that in this setting the Cauchy type integral \mathcal C is the sum of the essential part \mathcal{C}^\sharp which is a Calder\'on-Zygmund operator and a remainder \mathcal R which is no longer a Calder\'on-Zygmund operator. We show that the commutator [b, \mathcal C] is bounded on weighted Morrey space L_{v}^{p,\kappa}(bD) (v\in A_p, 1<p<\infty) if and only if b is in the BMO space on bD. Moreover, the commutator [b, \mathcal C] is compact on weighted Morrey space L_{v}^{p,\kappa}(bD) (v\in A_p, 1<p<\infty) if and only if b is in the VMO space on bD.
