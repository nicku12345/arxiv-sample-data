The purpose of the present paper is to find the necessary and sufficient conditions for the subclasses of analytic functions associated with Pascal distribution to be in subclasses of spiral-like univalent functions and inclusion relations for such subclasses in the open unit disk \mathbb{D}. Further, we consider the properties of integral operator related to Pascal distribution series. Several corollaries and consequences of the main results are also considered.
