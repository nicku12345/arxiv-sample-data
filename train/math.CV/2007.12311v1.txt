In this paper, we consider the entire solutions of nonlinear difference equation f^3+q(z)\Delta f=p_1 e^{\alpha_1 z}+ p_2 e^{\alpha_2 z}  where q is a polynomial, and p_1, p_2, \alpha_1, \alpha_2 are nonzero constants with \alpha_1\neq \alpha_2. It is showed that if f is a non-constant entire solution of \rho_2(f)<1 to the above equation, then f(z)=e_1e^{\frac{\alpha_1 z}{3}}+e_2e^{\frac{\alpha_2 z}{3}},  where e_1 and e_2 are two constants. Meanwhile, we give an affirmative answer to the conjecture posed by Zhang et al in [18].
