Suppose p\geq1, w=P[F] is a harmonic mapping of the unit disk \mathbb{D} satisfying F is absolutely continuous and \dot{F}\in L^p(0, 2\pi), where \dot{F}(e^{it})=\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}F(e^{it}). In this paper, we obtain Bergman norm estimates of the partial derivatives for w, i.e., \|w_z\|_{L^p} and \|\overline{w_{\bar{z}}}\|_{L^p}, where 1\leq p<2. Furthermore, if w is a harmonic quasiregular mapping of \mathbb{D}, then we show that w_z and \overline{w_{\bar{z}}} are in the Hardy space H^p, where 1\leq p\leq\infty. The corresponding Hardy norm estimates, \|w_z\|_{p} and \|\overline{w_{\bar{z}}}\|_{p}, are also obtained.
