Value distribution and uniqueness problems of difference operator of an entire function have been investigated in this article. This research shows that a finite ordered entire function  f  when sharing a set  \mathcal{S}=\{\alpha(z), \beta(z)\}  of two entire functions  \alpha  and  \beta  with  \max\{\rho(\alpha), \rho(\beta)\}<\rho(f)  with its difference  \mathcal{L}^n_c(f)=\sum_{j=0}^{n}a_jf(z+jc) , then  \mathcal{L}^n_c(f)\equiv f , and more importantly certain form of the function  f  has been found. The results in this paper improve those given by \emph{k. Liu}, \emph{X. M. Li}, \emph{J. Qi, Y. Wang and Y. Gu} etc. Some constructive examples have been exhibited to show the condition  \max\{\rho(\alpha), \rho(\beta)\}<\rho(f)  is sharp in our main result. Examples have been also exhibited to show that if  CM  sharing is replaced by  IM  sharing, then conclusion of the main results ceases to hold.
