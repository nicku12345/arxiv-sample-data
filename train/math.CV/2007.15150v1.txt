We study local minima of the p-conformal energy functionals, \[ \mathsf{E}_{\cal A}^\ast(h):=\int_\ID {\cal A}(\IK(w,h)) \;J(w,h) \; dw,\quad h|_\IS=h_0|_\IS, \] defined for self mappings h:\ID\to\ID with finite distortion of the unit disk with prescribed boundary values h_0. Here \IK(w,h) = \frac{\|Dh(w)\|^2}{J(w,h)}  is the pointwise distortion functional, and {\cal A}:[1,\infty)\to [1,\infty) is convex and increasing with {\cal A}(t)\approx t^p for some p\geq 1, with additional minor technical conditions. Note {\cal A}(t)=t is the Dirichlet energy functional.   Critical points of \mathsf{E}_{\cal A}^\ast satisfy the Ahlfors-Hopf inner-variational equation \[ {\cal A}'(\IK(w,h)) h_w \overline{h_\wbar} = \Phi \] where \Phi is a holomorphic function. Iwaniec, Kovalev and Onninen established the Lipschitz regularity of critical points. Here we give a sufficient condition to ensure that a local minimum is a diffeomorphic solution to this equation, and that it is unique. This condition is necessarily satisfied by any locally quasiconformal critical point, and is basically the assumption \IK(w,h)\in L^1(\ID)\cap L^r_{loc}(\ID) for some r>1.
