In the present paper, we study the order of convexity of z\Gauss(a,b;c;z) with real parameters a, b and c where \Gauss(a,b;c;z) is the Gaussian hypergeometric function. First we obtain some conditions for z\Gauss(a,b;c;z) with no any finite orders of convexity by considering its asymptotic behavior around z=1. Then the order of convexity of z\Gauss(a,b;c;z) is demonstrated for some ranges of real parameters a,b and c. In the last section, we give some examples as the applications of the main results.
