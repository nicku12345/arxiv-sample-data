We say that a class \mathcal{B} of analytic functions f of the form f(z)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} a_{n}z^{n} in the unit disk \mathbb{D}:=\{z\in \mathbb{C}: |z|<1\} satisfies a Bohr phenomenon if for the largest radius R_{f}<1, the following inequality  \sum\limits_{n=1}^{\infty} |a_{n}z^{n}| \leq d(f(0),\partial f(\mathbb{D}) )  holds for |z|=r\leq R_{f} and for all functions f \in \mathcal{B}. The largest radius R_{f} is called Bohr radius for the class \mathcal{B}. In this article, we obtain Bohr radius for certain subclasses of close-to-convex analytic functions. We establish the Bohr phenomenon for certain analytic classes \mathcal{S}_{c}^{*}(\phi),\,\mathcal{C}_{c}(\phi),\, \mathcal{C}_{s}^{*}(\phi),\, \mathcal{K}_{s}(\phi). Using Bohr phenomenon for subordination classes \cite[Lemma 1]{bhowmik-2018}, we obtain some radius R_{f} such that Bohr phenomenon for these classes holds for |z|=r\leq R_{f}. Generally, in this case R_{f} need not be sharp, but we show that under some additional conditions on \phi, the radius R_{f} becomes sharp bound. As a consequence of these results, we obtain several interesting corollaries on Bohr phenomenon for the aforesaid classes.
