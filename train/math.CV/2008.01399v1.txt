By introducing a new metric density via Busemann function, we establish an unbounded uniformizing Gromov hyperbolic spaces procedure which is an analogue of a recent work of Bonk, Heinonen and Koskela in \cite{BHK}. Then we show that there is a one-to-one correspondence between the quasi-isometry classes of proper geodesic Gromov hyperbolic spaces that are roughly starlike with respect to the points at the boundaries of infinity and the quasi-similarity classes of unbounded locally compact uniform spaces.   As applications, we establish Teichm\"{u}ller's displacement theorem for roughly quasi-isometry in Gromov hyperbolic spaces, and explain the connections to the bilipschitz extensions of certain Gromov hyperbolic spaces. By using our uniformizing procedure, we also provide a new proof for V\"{a}is\"{a}l\"{a}-Heinonen-N\"{a}kki's Theorem in the setting of metric spaces. Moreover, we obtain the quasisymmetry from local to global on uniform metric spaces.
