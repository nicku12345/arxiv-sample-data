Let \mathcal{A} denote the set of all analytic functions f in the unit disk \mathbb{D}:=\{z \in \mathbb{C}: |z| < 1\} normalized by f (0) = 0 and f'(0) = 1. The logarithmic coefficients \gamma_n of f \in \mathcal{A} are defined by  \log f(z)/z =2 \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\gamma_{n}z^{n}. In the present paper, the upper bound of the third logarithmic coefficient in general case of f''(0) was computed when f belongs to some familiar subclasses of close-to-convex functions.
