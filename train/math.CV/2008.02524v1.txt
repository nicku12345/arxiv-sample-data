Suppose f\in L^p(\mathbb{D}), where p\geq1 and \mathbb{D} is the unit disk. Let \mathfrak{J}_0 be the integral operator defined as follows: \mathfrak{J}_0[f](z)=\int_{\mathbb{D}}\frac{z}{1-\bar{w}z}f(w)\mathrm{d}A(w), where z, w\in\mathbb{D} and \mathrm{d}A(w)=\frac{1}{\pi}\mathrm{d}x\mathrm{d}y is the normalized area measure on \mathbb{D}. Suppose \mathfrak{J}_0^* is the adjoint operator of \mathfrak{J}_0. Then \mathfrak{J}^*_0=\mathfrak{B}\mathfrak{C}, where \mathfrak{B} and \mathfrak{C} are the operators induced by the Bergman projection and Cauchy transform, respectively. In this paper, we obtain the L^1, L^2 and L^{\infty} norm of the operator \mathfrak{J}_0^*. Moreover, we obtain the L^p(\mathbb{D})\rightarrow L^\infty(\mathbb{D}) norm of the operators \mathfrak{C} and \mathfrak{J}_0^*, provided that p>2. This study is a continuation of the investigations carried out in [4] and [11].
