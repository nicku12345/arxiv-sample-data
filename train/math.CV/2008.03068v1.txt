Let \mathbb{D} be the unit disk and \varphi\in L^p(\mathbb{D}, \mathrm{d}A), where 1\leq p\leq\infty. For z\in\mathbb{D}, the Cauchy-transform on \mathbb{D}, denote by \mathcal{P}, is defined as follows: \mathcal{P}[\varphi](z)=-\int_{\mathbb{D}}\left(\frac{\varphi(w)}{w-z}+\frac{z\overline{\varphi(w)}}{1-\bar{w}z}\right)\mathrm{d}A(w). The Beurling transform on \mathbb{D}, denote by \mathcal{H}, is now defined as the z-derivative of \mathcal{P}. In this paper, by using Hardy's type inequalities and Bessel functions, we show that \|\mathcal{P}\|_{L^2\to L^2}=\alpha\approx1.086, where \alpha is a solution to the equation: 2J_0(2/\alpha)-\alpha J_1(2/\alpha)=0, and J_0, J_1 are Bessel functions. Moreover, for p>2, by using Taylor expansion, Parseval's formula and hypergeometric functions, we also prove that \|\mathcal{P}\|_{L^p\to L^{\infty}}=2(\Gamma(2-q)/\Gamma^2(2-\frac{q}{2}))^{1/q}, where q=p/(p-1) is the conjugate exponent of p, and \Gamma is the Gamma function. Finally, applying the same techniques developed in this paper, we show that the Beurling transform \mathcal{H} acts as an isometry of L^2(\mathbb{D}, \mathrm{d}A).
