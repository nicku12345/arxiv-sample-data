For a non-empty compact set E in a proper subdomain \Omega of the complex plane, we denote the diameter of E and the distance from E to the boundary of \Omega by d(E) and d(E,\partial\Omega), respectively. The quantity d(E)/d(E,\partial\Omega) is invariant under similarities and plays an important role in Geometric Function Theory. In the present paper, when \Omega has the hyperbolic distance h_\Omega(z,w), we consider the infimum \kappa(\Omega) of the quantity h_\Omega(E)/\log(1+d(E)/d(E,\partial\Omega)) over compact subsets E of \Omega with at least two points, where h_\Omega(E) stands for the hyperbolic diameter of the set E. We denote the upper half-plane by \mathbb{H}. Our main results claim that \kappa(\Omega) is positive if and only if the boundary of \Omega is uniformly perfect and that the inequality \kappa(\Omega)\leq\kappa(\mathbb{H}) holds for all \Omega, where equality holds precisely when \Omega is convex.
