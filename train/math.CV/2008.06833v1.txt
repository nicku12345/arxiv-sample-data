We introduce and study a class of starlike functions defined by \begin{equation*} \mathscr{S}^*_\wp:=\left\{f\in\mathcal{A}: \frac{zf'(z)}{f(z)}\prec 1+ze^z=:\wp(z)\right\}, \end{equation*} where \wp maps the unit disk onto a cardioid domain. We find the radius of convexity of \wp(z) and establish the inclusion relations between the class  \mathscr{S}^*_\wp and some well-known classes. Further we derive sharp radius constants and coefficient related results for the class  \mathscr{S}^*_\wp.
