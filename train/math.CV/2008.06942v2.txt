Let \Sigma = \mathbb B^n/\Gamma be a compact complex hyperbolic space with torsion-free lattice \Gamma\subset SU(n,1) and \Omega  a quotient of \mathbb B^n \times\mathbb B^n with respect to the diagonal action of \Gamma which is a holomorphic \mathbb B^n-fiber bundle over \Sigma. The goal of this article is to investigate the relation between symmetric differentials of \Sigma and the weighted L^2 holomorphic functions on the exhaustions \Omega_\epsilon of \Omega. If there exists a holomorphic function on \Omega_\epsilon on some \epsilon, then there exists a symmetric differential on \Sigma. Using this property, we show that \Sigma always has a symmetric differential of degree N for any N\geq n+1. Moreover for each symmetric differential over \Sigma, we construct a weighted L^2 holomorphic function on \Omega_{1\over \sqrt{n}}.
