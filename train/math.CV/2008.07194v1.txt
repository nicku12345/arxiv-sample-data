We provide a new way of simultaneously parametrizing arbitrary local CR maps from real-analytic generic manifolds M\subset {\mathbb C}^N into spheres {\mathbb S}^{2N'-1}\subset {\mathbb C}^{N'} of any dimension. The parametrization is obtained as a composition of universal rational maps with a holomorphic map depending only on M. As applications, we obtain rigidity results of different flavours such as unique jet determination and global extension of local CR maps.
