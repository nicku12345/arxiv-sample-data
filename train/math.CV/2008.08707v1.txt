For any A(z),B(z),C(z)\in\mathbb{C}[z], we study the zero distribution of a table of polynomials \left\{ P_{m,n}(z)\right\} _{m,n\in\mathbb{N}_{0}} satisfying the recurrence relation \[ P_{m,n}(z)=A(z)P_{m-1,n}(z)+B(z)P_{m,n-1}(z)+C(z)P_{m-1,n-1}(z) \] with the initial condition P_{0,0}(z)=1 and P_{-m,-n}(z)=0 \forall m,n\in\mathbb{N}. We show that the zeros of P_{m,n}(z) lie on a curve whose equation is given explicitly in terms of A(z),B(z), and C(z). We also study the zero distribution of a case with a general initial condition.
