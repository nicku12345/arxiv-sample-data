In this paper we have mainly focused on the uniqueness of two meromorphic functions under the realm of two shared sets problem with certain restrictions which in turn improve the results of { P. Sahoo and H. Karmakar, Uniqueness theorems related to weighted sharing of two sets, Acta Univ. Sapientiae, Mathematica, 10(2) (2018), 329-339} and {P. Sahoo and A. Sarkar, On the uniqueness of meromorphic functions sharing two sets, Bol. Soc. Mat. Mex., (2019), 1-7}. In particular, pointing out some gaps in the statements of the results in { P. Sahoo and H. Karmakar, Uniqueness theorems related to weighted sharing of two sets, Acta Univ. Sapientiae, Mathematica, 10(2) (2018), 329-339} and {P. Sahoo and A. Sarkar, On the uniqueness of meromorphic functions sharing two sets, Bol. Soc. Mat. Mex., (2019), 1-7}. we have removed the order restrictions on the main results in { P. Sahoo and H. Karmakar, Uniqueness theorems related to weighted sharing of two sets, Acta Univ. Sapientiae, Mathematica, 10(2) (2018), 329-339} and {P. Sahoo and A. Sarkar, On the uniqueness of meromorphic functions sharing two sets, Bol. Soc. Mat. Mex., (2019), 1-7} at the cost of sharing of an additional singleton. A number of examples have been provided by us to show some conditions in our results are essential.
