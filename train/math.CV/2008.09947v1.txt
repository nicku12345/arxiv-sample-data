We consider the planar unit disk \mathbb D as the reference configuration and a Jordan domain \mathbb Y as the deformed configuration, and study the problem of extending a given boundary homeomorphism \varphi \colon \partial \mathbb D \to \partial \mathbb Y as a Sobolev homeomorphism of the complex plane. Investigating such a Sobolev variant of the classical Jordan-Sch\"onflies theorem is motivated by the well-posedness of the related pure displacement variational questions in the theory of Nonlinear Elasticity (NE) and Geometric Function Theory (GFT). Clearly, the necessary condition for the boundary mapping \varphi to admit a W^{1,p}-Sobolev homeomorphic extension is that it first admits a continuous W^{1,p}-Sobolev extension. For an arbitrary target domain \mathbb Y this, however, is not sufficent.
