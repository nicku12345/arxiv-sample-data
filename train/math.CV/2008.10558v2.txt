For spaces of analytic functions defined on an open set in \mathbb{C}^n that satisfy certain nice properties, we show that operators that preserve shift-cyclic functions are necessarily weighted composition operators. Examples of spaces for which this result holds true consist of the Hardy space H^p(\mathbb{D}^n) \, (0 < p < \infty), the Drury-Arveson space \mathcal{H}^2_n, and the Dirichlet-type space \mathcal{D}_{\alpha} \, (\alpha \in \mathbb{R}). We focus on the Hardy spaces and show that when 1 \leq p < \infty, the converse is also true. The techniques used to prove the main result also enable us to prove a version of the Gleason-Kahane-\.Zelazko theorem for partially multiplicative linear functionals on spaces of analytic functions in more than one variable.
