Let f = P[F] denote the Poisson integral of F in the unit disk \mathbb{D} with F being absolutely continuous in the unit circle \mathbb{T} and \dot{F}\in L_p(0, 2\pi), where \dot{F}(e^{it})=\frac{d}{dt} F(e^{it}) and p\geq 1. Recently, the author in \cite{Zhu} proved that (1) if f is a harmonic mapping and 1\leq p< 2, then f_{z} and \overline{f_{\overline{z}}}\in \mathcal{B}^{p}(\mathbb{D}), the classical Bergman spaces of \mathbb{D} \cite[Theorem 1.2]{Zhu}; (2) if f is a harmonic quasiregular mapping and 1\leq p\leq \infty, then f_{z}, \overline{f_{\overline{z}}}\in \mathcal{H}^{p}(\mathbb{D}), the classical Hardy spaces of \mathbb{D} \cite[Theorem 1.3]{Zhu}. These are the main results in \cite{Zhu}. The purpose of this paper is to generalize these two results. First, we prove that, under the same assumptions, \cite[Theorem 1.2]{Zhu} is true when 1\leq p< \infty. Also, we show that \cite[Theorem 1.2]{Zhu} is not true when p=\infty. Second, we demonstrate that \cite[Theorem 1.3]{Zhu} still holds true when the assumption f being a harmonic quasiregular mapping is replaced by the weaker one f being a harmonic elliptic mapping.
