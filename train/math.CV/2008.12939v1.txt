In this paper, we present several necessary and sufficient conditions for a harmonic mapping to be normal. Also, we discuss maximum principle and five-point theorem for normal harmonic mappings. Furthermore, we investigate the convergence of sequences for sense-preserving normal harmonic mappings and show that the asymptotic values and angular limits are identical for normal harmonic mappings.
