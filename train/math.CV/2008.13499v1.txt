In this paper, we consider the Ma-Minda classes of analytic functions \mathcal{S}^{*}(\phi):= \{f\in \mathcal{A} : ({zf'(z)}/{f(z)}) \prec \phi(z) \} and \mathcal{C}(\phi):= \{f\in \mathcal{A} : (1+{zf''(z)}/{f'(z)}) \prec \phi(z) \} defined on the unit disk \mathbb{D} and show that the classes \mathcal{S}^{*}(1+\alpha z) and \mathcal{C}(1+\alpha z), 0<\alpha \leq 1 solve the problem of finding the sharp \mathcal{S}^{*}(\phi)-radii and \mathcal{C}(\phi)-radii for some normalized special functions, whenever \phi(-1)=1-\alpha. Radius of strongly starlikeness is also considered.
