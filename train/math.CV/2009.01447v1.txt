We prove that convex functions of finite order on the real line and subharmonic functions of finite order on finite dimensional real space, bounded from above outside of some set of zero relative Lebesgue density, are bounded from above everywhere. It follows that subharmonic functions of finite order on the complex plane, entire and plurisubharmonic functions of finite order, and convex or harmonic functions of finite order bounded from above outside some set of zero relative Lebesgue density are constant.
