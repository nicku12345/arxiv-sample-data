In this article, we consider certain matricial domains that are naturally associated to a given domain of the complex plane. A particular example of such domains is the spectral unit ball. We present several results for these matricial domains. Our first result shows, generalizing a result of Ransford-White for the spectral unit ball, that the holomorphic automorphism group of these matricial domains does not act transitively. We also consider 2-point and 3-point Pick-Nevanlinna interpolation problem from the unit disc to these matricial domains. We present results providing necessary conditions for the existence of a holomorphic interpolant for these problems. In particular, we shall observe that these results are generalizations of the results provided by Bharali and Chandel related to these problems.
