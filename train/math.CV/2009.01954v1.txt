We give an exposition of results from a crossroad between geometric function theory, harmonic analysis, boundary value problems and approximation theory, which characterize quasicircles. We will specifically expose the interplay between the jump decomposition, singular integral operators and approximation by Faber series. Our unified point of view is made possible by the the concept of transmission.
