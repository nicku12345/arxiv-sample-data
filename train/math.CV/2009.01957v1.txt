In this paper we consider interpolation in model spaces, H^2 \ominus B H^2 with B a Blaschke product. We study unions of interpolating sequences for two sequences that are far from each other in the pseudohyperbolic metric as well as two sequences that are close to each other in the pseudohyperbolic metric. The paper concludes with a discussion of the behavior of Frostman sequences under perturbations.
