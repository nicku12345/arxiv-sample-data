In [Israel J. Math, 2014], Grahl and Nevo obtained a significant improvement for the well-known normality criterion of Montel. They proved that for a family of meromorphic functions \mathcal F in a domain D\subset \mathbb C, and for a positive constant \epsilon, if for each f\in \mathcal F there exist meromorphic functions a_f,b_f,c_f such that f omits a_f,b_f,c_f in D and \min\{\rho(a_f(z),b_f(z)), \rho(b_f(z),c_f(z)), \rho(c_f(z),a_f(z))\}\geq \epsilon, for all z\in D, then \mathcal F is normal in D. Here, \rho is the spherical metric in \widehat{\mathbb C}. In this paper, we establish the high-dimensional versions for the above result and for the following well-known result of Lappan: A meromorphic function  f in the unit disc \triangle:=\{z\in\mathbb C: |z|<1\} is normal if there are five distinct values a_1,\dots,a_5 such that \sup\{(1-|z|^2)\frac{ |f '(z)|}{1+|f(z)|^2}: z\in f^{-1}\{a_1,\dots,a_5\}\} < \infty.
