We introduce the class of analytic functions \mathcal{F}(\psi):= \left\{f\in \mathcal{A}: \left(\frac{zf'(z)}{f(z)}-1\right) \prec \psi(z),\; \psi(0)=0 \right\}, where \psi is univalent and establish the growth theorem with some geometric conditions on \psi and obtain the Koebe domain with some related sharp inequalities. Note that functions in this class may not be univalent. As an application, we obtain the growth theorem for the complete range of \alpha and \beta for the functions in the classes \mathcal{BS}(\alpha):= \{f\in \mathcal{A} : ({zf'(z)}/{f(z)})-1 \prec {z}/{(1-\alpha z^2)},\; \alpha\in [0,1) \} and \mathcal{S}_{cs}(\beta):= \{f\in \mathcal{A} : ({zf'(z)}/{f(z)})-1 \prec {z}/({(1-z)(1+\beta z)}),\; \beta\in [0,1) \}, respectively which improves the earlier known bounds. The sharp Bohr-radii for the classes S(\mathcal{BS}(\alpha)) and \mathcal{BS}(\alpha) are also obtained. A few examples as well as certain newly defined classes on the basis of geometry are also discussed.
