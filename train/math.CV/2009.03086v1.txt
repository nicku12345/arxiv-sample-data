We show that every holomorphic map f\in\mathcal{H}(\Omega\setminus K) (K\subset\Omega\subset\mathbb{C}^n, with K compact, \Omega open, and n\ge2), has a unique "\emph{Hartogs companion}" \tilde f\in\mathcal{H}(\Omega) matching f on an open subset C_{K,\Omega}\subset\Omega\setminus K. Furthermore, \tilde f extends f, \emph{if and only if} \mathbb{C}^n\setminus K is a connected set; this equivalence proves the converse implication from the Hartogs Kugelsatz. The existence of vector-valued Hartogs companions in any dimension yields a Hartogs-type extension theorem for G\^ateaux holomorphic maps f\in\mathcal{H}_\mathrm{G}(\Omega\setminus K,Y) on finitely open sets in arbitrary complex vector spaces. The equivalence is very similar to that for K\subset\Omega\subset\mathbb{C}^n and leads to a corresponding Hartogs Kugelsatz in arbitrary dimension and to extension theorems for five types of holomorphy (G\^ateaux, Mackey/Silva, hypoanalytic, Fr\'echet, locally bounded). We also show that the range \tilde f(\Omega) of a vector-valued Hartogs companion cannot leave a domain of holomorphy containing f(\Omega\setminus K). We establish a boundary principle for maps f\in\mathcal{H}_\mathrm{G}(\Omega,Y)\cap\mathcal{C}(\bar\Omega,Y) on finitely bounded open sets. For Y=\mathbb{C}, the principle states that f\big(\bar\Omega\big)=f(\partial\Omega) (hence \sup_{x\in\Omega}|f(x)|=\sup_{x\in\partial\Omega}|f(x)|). Several results require a new identity theorem, which yields a maximum norm principle and a "max-min" seminorm principle.
