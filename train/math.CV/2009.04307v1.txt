In this paper we determine explicitly the kernels \mathbb K_{\alpha,\beta} associated with new Bergman spaces \mathcal A_{\alpha,\beta}^2(\mathbb D) considered recently by the first author and M. Zaway. Then we study the distribution of the zeros of these kernels essentially when \alpha\in\mathbb N where the zeros are given by the zeros of a real polynomial Q_{\alpha,\beta}. Some numerical results are given throughout the paper.
