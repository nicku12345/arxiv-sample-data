We prove that subharmonic functions of finite order on finite dimensional real space, bounded from above outside of some asymptotically small sets on spheres, are bounded from above everywhere. It follows that subharmonic functions of finite order on the complex plane, entire and plurisubharmonic functions of finite order, and convex or harmonic functions of finite order bounded from above outside of such sets on spheres are constant. Our results and methods of proof are also new for functions of one complex variable.
