We establish a type of the Picard's theorem for entire curves in P^n(\mathbb C) whose spherical derivative vanishes on the inverse images of hypersurface targets. Then, as a corollary, we prove that there is an union D of finite number of hypersurfaces in the complex projective space P^n(\mathbb C) such that for every entire curve f in P^n(\mathbb C), if the spherical derivative f^{\#} of f is bounded on  f^{-1}(D), then f^{\#} is bounded on the entire complex plane, and hence, f is a Brody curve.
