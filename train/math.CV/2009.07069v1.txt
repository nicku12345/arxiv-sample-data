Within the Ramanujan theories of elliptic functions, Li-Chien Shen constructed natural elliptic functions in signature three and signature four. When applied in signature six, the same constructions produce non-elliptic functions that nevertheless engender the corresponding hypergeometric identities of Ramanujan.
