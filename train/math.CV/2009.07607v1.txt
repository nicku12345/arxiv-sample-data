In this paper we study the Gauss and Kummer hypergeometric equations in depth. In particular, we focus on the confluence of two regular singularities of the Gauss hypergeometric equation to produce the Kummer hypergeometric equation with an irregular singularity at infinity. We show how to pass from solutions with power-like behaviour which are analytic in disks, to solutions with exponential behaviour which are analytic in sectors and have divergent asymptotics. We explicitly calculate the Stokes matrices of the confluent system in terms of the monodromy data, specifically the connection matrices, of the original system around the merging singularities.
