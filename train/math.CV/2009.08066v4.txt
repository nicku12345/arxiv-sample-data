In this paper, we study the uniqueness of the differential-difference of entire functions. We prove the following result: Let f be a transcendental entire function of finite order, let \eta be a non-zero complex number, n\geq1, k\geq0 two integers and let a and b be two distinct finite complex numbers. If f and (\Delta_{\eta}^{n}f)^{(k)} share a CM and share b IM, then f\equiv(\Delta_{\eta}^{n}f)^{(k)}.
