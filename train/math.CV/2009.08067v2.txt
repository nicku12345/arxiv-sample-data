An example in the article shows that the first derivative of f(z)=\frac{2}{1-e^{-2z}} sharing 0 CM and 1,\infty IM with its shift can not obtain they are equal. In this paper, we study the uniqueness of meromorphic function sharing small functions with their shifts concerning its k-th derivatives. We use a different method from Qi and Yang \cite {qy} to improves entire function to meromorphic function, the first derivative to the k-th derivatives, and also finite values to small functions. As for k=0, we obtain: Let f(z) be a transcendental meromorphic function of hyper-order less than 1, let c be a nonzero finite value, and let a(z)\not\equiv\infty and b(z)\not\equiv\infty be two distinct small functions of f(z) and f(z+c) such that a(z) a periodic function with period c. If f(z) and f(z+c) share a(z),\infty CM, and share b(z) IM, then either f(z)\equiv f(z+c) or f(z)\equiv f(z+2c).
