Let \phi be analytic and univalent ({\it i.e.,} one-to-one) in \mathbb{D}:=\{z\in\mathbb{C}: |z|<1\} such that \phi(\mathbb{D}) has positive real part, is symmetric with respect to the real axis, starlike with respect to \phi(0)=1, and \phi ' (0)>0. A function f \in \mathcal{C}(\phi) if 1+ zf''(z)/f'(z) \prec \phi (z), and f\in \mathcal{C}_{c}(\phi) if 2(zf'(z))'/(f(z)+\overline{f(\bar{z})})' \prec \phi (z) for  z\in \mathbb{D}. In this article, we consider the classes \mathcal{HC}(\phi) and \mathcal{HC}_{c}(\phi) consisting of harmonic mappings f=h+\overline{g} of the form  h(z)=z+ \sum \limits_{n=2}^{\infty} a_{n}z^{n} \quad \mbox{and} \quad g(z)=\sum \limits_{n=2}^{\infty} b_{n}z^{n}  in the unit disk \mathbb{D}, where h belongs to \mathcal{C}(\phi) and \mathcal{C}_{c}(\phi) respectively, with the dilation g'(z)=\alpha z h'(z) and |\alpha|<1. Using the Bohr phenomenon for subordination classes \cite[Lemma 1]{bhowmik-2018}, we find the radius R_{f}<1 such that Bohr inequality  |z|+\sum_{n=2}^{\infty} (|a_{n}|+|b_{n}|)|z|^{n} \leq d(f(0),\partial f(\mathbb{D}))  holds for |z|=r\leq R_{f} for the classes \mathcal{HC}(\phi) and \mathcal{HC}_{c}(\phi) . As a consequence of these results, we obtain several interesting corollaries on Bohr inequality for the aforesaid classes.
