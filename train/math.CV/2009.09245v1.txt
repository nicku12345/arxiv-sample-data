In this paper, with the help of the idea of weakly weighted sharing introduced by \emph{Lin -Lin} [Kodai Math. J., 29(2006), 269-280], we study the uniqueness of a polynomial expression  P(f)  and  [P(f)]^{(k)}  of a meromorphic function  f  sharing a small function. The main results significantly improved the result of \emph{Liu - Gu} [Kodai Math. J., 27(3)(2004), 272-279]. This research work explores certain condition under which the polynomial  P(f)  can be reduced to a non-zero monomial, and as a consequence, the specific form of the function  f  is obtained. By some constructive examples it has been shown that some conditions in the main results can not be removed and some of the inequalities are sharp.
