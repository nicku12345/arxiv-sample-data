A theorem of Wiegerinck says that the Bergman space over any domain in \mathbb C is either trivial or infinite dimensional. We generalize this theorem in the following form. Let L be a hermitian, holomorphic line bundle over \mathbb P^1, the later equipped with a volume form and D an arbitrary domain in \mathbb P^1. Then the space of holomorphic L2 sections of L over D is either equal to H^0(M,L) or it has infinite dimension.
