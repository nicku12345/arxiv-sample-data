In the Clifford algebra setting the present study develops three reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces of the Paley-Wiener type, namely the Paley-Wiener spaces, the Hardy spaces on strips, and the Bergman spaces on strips. In particular, we give spectrum characterizations and representation formulas of the functions in those spaces and estimation of their respective reproducing kernels. Based on the kernel estimations we show that the spaces satisfy the boundary vanishing condition. As a consequence of the latter, efficient approximations by linear combinations of the parameterized kernel functions are available.
