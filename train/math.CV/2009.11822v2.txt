We consider the cell decomposition of the moduli space of real genus two curves with a marked point on the only real oval. The cells are enumerated by certain graphs with their weights describing the complex structure on a curve. We show that collapse of the edge of the graph results in a root like singularity of the natural mapping from the graph weights to the moduli space of curves.
