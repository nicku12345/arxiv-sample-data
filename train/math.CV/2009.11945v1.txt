Let function f be normalized, analytic and univalent in the unit disk {\mathbb D}=\{z:|z|<1\} and f(z)=z+\sum_{n=2}^{\infty} a_n z^n. Using a method based on Grusky coefficients we study several problems over that class of univalent functions: upper bound of the third logarithmic coefficient, upper bound of the coefficient difference |a_4|-|a_3|, the special case of the generalized Zalcman conjecture |a_2a_3-a_4| and upper bounds of the second and the third Hankel determinant. Obtained results improve the previous ones.
