We have proved theorems on compact classes of homeomorphisms with hydrodynamic normalization that are solutions of the Beltrami equation, whose characteristics are compactly supported and satisfy certain constraints of an integral type. As a consequence, we obtained results on compact classes of solutions of corresponding Dirichlet problems considered in some Jordan domain.
