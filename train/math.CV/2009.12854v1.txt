In this paper, we investigate the uniqueness property of meromorphic functions together with its linear difference polynomial sharing two sets. Using the polynomial introduced in [FILOMAT 33(18)(2019), 6055-6072], we have improved the result of Li-Chen [Abstract and Applied Analysis, 2014, Article ID 894968] in sense of reducing cardinalities of the main set S and the associated weights. Some examples have been exhibited to validate our certain claims in the main result.
