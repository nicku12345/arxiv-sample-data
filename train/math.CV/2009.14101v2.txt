Combining V. Koziarz's observation about the regularity of some modified section related to the initial extension with J. McNeal--D. Varolin's regularity argument, we generalize two theorems of McNeal--Varolin for the L^2 extension of \bar\partial-closed high-degree forms on a Stein manifold to the weakly pseudoconvex K\"ahler case under mixed positivity conditions.
