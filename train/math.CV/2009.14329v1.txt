The so-called weighted solid Cauchy transform, from inside the unit disc into the complement of its closure, is considered and their basic properties such as boundedness is studied for appropriate probability measures. The action the disc polynomials is explicitly computed and used to describe the range of its restriction on the weighted true poly-Bergman spaces.
