If \Omega is a simply connected domain in \overline{{\mathbb C}} then, according to the Ahlfors-Gehring theorem, \Omega is a quasidisk if and only if there exists a sufficient condition for the univalence of holomorphic functions in \Omega in relation to the growth of their Schwarzian derivative. We extend this theorem to harmonic mappings by proving a univalence criterion on quasidisks. We also show that the mappings satisfying this criterion admit a homeomorphic extension to \overline{{\mathbb C}} and, under the additional assumption of quasiconformality in \Omega, they admit a quasiconformal extension to \overline{{\mathbb C}}.   The Ahlfors-Gehring theorem has been extended to finitely connected domains \Omega by Osgood, Beardon and Gehring, who showed that a Schwarzian criterion for univalence holds in \Omega if and only if the components of \partial\Omega are either points or quasicircles. We generalize this theorem to harmonic mappings.
