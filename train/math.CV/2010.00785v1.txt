In this note we obtain a version of the well-known Riesz's theorem on conjugate harmonic functions for Lumer's Hardy spaces (Lh)^2(\Omega) on arbitrary domains \Omega: If a real-valued harmonic function U\in (Lh)^2(\Omega) has a harmonic conjugate V on \Omega (i.e., a real-valued harmonic function such that U+ iV is analytic on \Omega), then U+iV also belongs to (Lh)^2(\Omega), and for the normalized conjugate we have the norm estimate \|U+iV\|_{(Lh)^2(\Omega)}\le\sqrt{2} \|U\|_{(Lh)^2(\Omega)}, with the best possible constant.
