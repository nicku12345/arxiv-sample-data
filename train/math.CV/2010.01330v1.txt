It is proved that the group of holomorphic automorphisms of holomorphically homogeneous nondegenerate (finite Bloom-Graham type + holomorphic nondegenaracy) model surface Q is a subgroup of the group of birational automorphisms of the ambient space (Cremona group) with uniformly bounded degree. An estimate of the degree of the automorphisms in terms of the dimension of the ambient space is given (Theorem 4). It is proved that none of the conditions of the theorem can be omitted. We consider also the question about connectedness of the automorphism group of Q (Theorem 7).
