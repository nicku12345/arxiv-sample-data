We consider paths of steepest descent, in the complex plane, for the norm of a non-constant one variable polynomial f. We show that such paths, starting from a zero of the logarithmic derivative of f and ending in a root of f, draw a tree in the complex plane, and we give an upper bound estimate on their lengths. In some case, we obtain a finer estimate that depends only on the set of roots of f, not on their multiplicity, and we wonder if this can be done in general.
