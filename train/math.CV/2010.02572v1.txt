Let D be a closed disk in the complex plane centered at the origin, f, g complex valued continuous function on D. Let P[f,g; D] (res. R[f, g; D])) be the uniform closure on D of polynomials (res. rational functions) in variables f and g. In \cite{OS}, using complex dynamical systems, O'Farrell and Sanabria-Garcia proved that \{\Big(z^2, \cfrac{\overline z}{1+\overline{z}}\Big): z\in D\} is not polynomially convex with D small enough and so that P[z^2,\cfrac{\overline z}{1+\overline z}; D]\ne C(D) if D is sufficient small. In this paper, we first give a certain conditions for rational convexity of union of two compact set of \Bbb C^n and apply to show that R[z^2, \cfrac{\overline z}{1+\overline z}; D]= C(D) for all D small enough
