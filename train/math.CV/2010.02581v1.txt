Let \D be the unit disk. Kutzschebauch and Studer \cite{KS} recently proved that, for each continuous map A:\overline D\to \mathrm{SL}(2,\C), which is holomorphic in \D, there exist continuous maps E,F:\overline \D\to \mathfrak{sl}(2,\C), which are holomorphic in \D, such that A=e^Ee^F. Also they asked if this extends to arbitrary compact bordered Riemann surfaces. We prove that this is possible.
