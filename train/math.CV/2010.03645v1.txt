The classical theorems of Mittag-Leffler and Weierstrass show that when \{\lambda_n\} is a sequence of distinct points in the open unit disk \D, with no accumulation points in \D, and \{w_n\} is any sequence of complex numbers, there is an analytic function \phi on \D for which \phi(\lambda_n) = w_n. A celebrated theorem of Carleson \cite{MR117349} characterizes when, for a bounded sequence \{w_n\}, this interpolating problem can be solved with a bounded analytic function. A theorem of Earl \cite{MR284588} goes further and shows that when Carleson's condition is satisfied, the interpolating function \phi can be a constant multiple of a Blaschke product. In this paper, we explore when the interpolating \phi can be an outer function. We then use our results to refine a result of McCarthy \cite{MR1065054} and explore the common range of the co-analytic Toeplitz operators on a model space.
