Let \Omega be a Carleson-Denjoy domain and G be its covering group. Let \mu be a Beltrami coefficient on the unit disk which is compatible with the group G. In this paper we show that if \frac{|\mu|^{2}}{1-|z|^{2}}dxdy satisfies the Carleson condition on the infinite boundary of the Dirichlet fundamental domain of G, then \frac{|\mu|^{2}}{1-|z|^{2}}dxdy is a Carleson measure on the unit disk. We also show that the above property does not hold for Denjoy domain.
