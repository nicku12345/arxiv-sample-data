We prove a realization theorem for rational functions of several complex variables which extends the main theorem of M. Bessmertnyi, "On realizations of rational matrix functions of several complex variables," in Vol. 134 of Oper. Theory Adv. Appl., pp. 157-185, Birkh\"{a}user Verlag, Basel, 2002. In contrast to Bessmertnyi's approach of solving large systems of linear equations, we use an operator theoretical approach based on the theory of Schur complements. This leads to a simpler and more "natural" construction to solving the realization problem as we need only apply elementary algebraic operations to Schur complements such as sums, products, inverses, and compositions. As such our approach leads to a solution of the realization problem that not only has a greater potential for further extensions and applications, but is also more natural within multidimensional systems theory especially for those linear models associated with electric circuits, networks, and composites.
