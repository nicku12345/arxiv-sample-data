The main purpose of this article is to present a generalization of Forelli's theorem for the functions holomorphic along a general pencil of holomorphic discs. This generalizes the main result of \cite{JKS13} and the original Forelli's theorem, and furthermore, answers one of the problems posed in \cite{Chirka06}.
