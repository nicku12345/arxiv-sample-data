For compact subsets E of the unit disk  \mathbb{D} we study the capacity of the condenser {\rm cap}( \mathbb{D},E) by means of set functionals defined in terms of hyperbolic geometry. In particular, we study experimentally the case of a hyperbolic triangle and arrive at the conjecture that of all triangles with the same hyperbolic area, the equilateral triangle has the least capacity.
