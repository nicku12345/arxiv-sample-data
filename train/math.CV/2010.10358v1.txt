This paper discusses the location of zeros of polynomials in a polynomial sequence \{P_n(z)\} generated by a three-term recurrence relation of the form P_n(z)+ B(z)P_{n-1}(z) +A(z) P_{n-k}(z)=0 with k>2 and the standard initial conditions P_{0}(z)=1, P_{-1}(z)=\ldots=P_{-k+1}(z)=0, where A(z) and B(z) are arbitrary coprime real polynomials. We show that there always exist polynomials in \{P_n(z)\} with non-real zeros.
