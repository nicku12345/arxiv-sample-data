Let \mathcal{T}_K(D) be the class of K-quasiconformal automorphisms of a domain D\subsetneq \mathbb{R}^n with identity boundary values. Teichm\"uller's problem is to determine how far a given point x\in D can be mapped under a mapping f\in \mathcal{T}_K(D). We estimate this distance between x and f(x) from the above by using two different metrics, the distance ratio metric and the quasihyperbolic metric. We study Teichm\"{u}ller's problem for Gromov hyperbolic domains in \mathbb{R}^n with identity values at the boundary of infinity. As applications, we obtain results on Teichm\"{u}ller's problem for \psi-uniform domains and inner uniform domains in \mathbb{R}^n.
