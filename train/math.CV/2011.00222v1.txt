We investigate the complex Gaussian as well as non-Gaussian distributed random analytical and entire functions (complex entire random field) and calculate their domain of definiteness (radius of convergence) as well as some important characteristics: order and type. As a consequence we deduce that all the mentioned characteristics, under very natural conditions, are deterministic (non-random) with probability one and we calculate them. Moreover we exhibit some examples to show the exactness of the obtained results.
