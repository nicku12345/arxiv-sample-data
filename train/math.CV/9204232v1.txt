We associate to any germ of an analytic variety a Lie algebra of tangent vector fields, the {\it tangent algebra}. Conversely, to any Lie algebra of vector fields an analytic germ can be associated, the {\it integral variety}. The paper investigates properties of this correspondence: The set of all tangent algebras is characterized in purely Lie algebra theoretic terms. And it is shown that the tangent algebra determines the analytic type of the variety.
