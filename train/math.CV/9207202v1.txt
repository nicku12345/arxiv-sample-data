The subject considered in this paper has, at least, three points of interest. Suppose that we have a sequence of one-dimensional analytic varieties in a domain in \Bbb C^n. The cluster of this sequence consists from all points in the domains such that every neighbourhood of such points intersects with infinitely many different varieties. The first question is: what analytic properties does the cluster inherit from varieties? We give a sufficient criterion when the cluster contains an analytic disk, but it follows from examples of Stolzenberg and Wermer that, in general, clusters can contain no analytic disks. So we study algebras of continuous function on clusters, which can be approximated by holomorphic functions or polynomials, and show that this algebras possess some analytic properties in all but explicitly pathological and uninteresting cases. Secondly, we apply and results about clusters to polynomial hulls and maximal functions, finding remnants of analytic structures there too. And, finally, due to more and more frequent appearances of analytic disks as tools in complex analysis, it seems to be interesting to look at their sequences to establish terminology, basic notation and properties.
