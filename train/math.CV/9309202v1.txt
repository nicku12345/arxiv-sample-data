We prove that there is a continuous non-negative function g on the unit sphere in \cd, d \geq 2, whose logarithm is integrable with respect to Lebesgue measure, and which vanishes at only one point, but such that no non-zero bounded analytic function m in the unit ball, with boundary values m^\star, has |m^\star| \leq g almost everywhere. The proof analyzes the common range of co-analytic Toeplitz operators in the Hardy space of the ball.
