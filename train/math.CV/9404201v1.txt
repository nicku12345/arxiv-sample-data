The main result of this paper is that the identity component of the automorphism group of a compact, connected, strictly pseudoconvex CR manifold is compact unless the manifold is CR equivalent to the standard sphere. In dimensions greater than 3, it has been pointed out by D. Burns that this result follows from known results on biholomorphism groups of complex manifolds with boundary and the fact that any such CR manifold M can be realized as the boundary of an analytic variety. When M is 3-dimensional, Burns's proof breaks down because abstract CR 3-manifolds are generically not realizable as boundaries. This paper provides an intrinsic proof of compactness that works in any dimension.
