The complex Monge-Amp\`ere operator (dd^c)^n is an important tool in complex analysis. It would be interesting to find the right notion of convergence u_j\to u such that (dd^cu_j)^n\to (dd^cu)^n in the weak topology. In this paper, using the C_{n-1}-capacity, we give a sufficient condition of the weak convergence (dd^cu_j)^n\to (dd^cu)^n. We also show that our condition is quite sharp in some case.
