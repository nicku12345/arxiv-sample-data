We define the domain of a linear fractional transformation in a space of operators and show that both the affine automorphisms and the compositions of symmetries act transitively on these domains. Further, we show that Liouville's theorem holds for domains of linear fractional transformations, and, with an additional trace class condition, so does the Riemann removable singularities theorem. We also show that every biholomorphic mapping of the operator domain I < Z^*Z is a linear isometry when the space of operators is a complex Jordan subalgebra of {\cal L}(H) with the removable singularity property and that every biholomorphic mapping of the operator domain I + Z_1^*Z_1 < Z_2^*Z_2 is a linear map obtained by multiplication on the left and right by J-unitary and unitary operators, respectively.   Readers interested only in the finite dimensional case may identify our spaces of operators with spaces of square and rectangular matrices.
