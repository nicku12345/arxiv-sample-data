We prove that if M and M' are algebraic hypersurfaces in  C^ N, i.e. both defined by the vanishing of real polynomials, then any sufficiently smooth CR mapping with Jacobian not identically zero extends holomorphically provided the hypersurfaces are holomorphically nondegenerate . Conversely, we prove that holomorphic nondegeneracy is necessary for this property of CR mappings to hold. For the case of unequal dimensions, we also prove that if M is an algebraic hypersurface in  C^N which does not contain any complex variety of positive codimension and M' is the sphere in  C^{N+1 } , then extendability holds for all CR mappings with certain minimal a priori regularity.   Theorem A. Let M and M' be two algebraic hypersurfaces in C^N and assume that M is connected and holomorphically nondegenerate. If H is a smooth CR mapping from M to M' with  Jac H \not\equiv 0, where Jac H is the Jacobian determinant of H, then H extends holomorphically in an open neighborhood of M in  C^N.   A recent example given by Ebenfelt shows that the conclusion of Theorem A need not hold if M is real analytic, but not algebraic.   Theorem B. Let M be a connected real analytic hypersurface in C^N which is holomorphically degenerate at some point p_1. Let p_0 \in M and suppose there exists a germ at p_0 of a smooth CR function on M which does not extend holomorphically to any full neighborhood of p_0 in C^N. Then there exists a germ at p_0 of a smooth CR diffeomorphism from M into itself, fixing p_0, which does not extend holomorphically to any neighborhood of p_0 in C^N.   Theorem C. Let M\subset C^N be an algebraic hypersurface. Assume that there is no nontrivial complex analytic variety contained in M through p_0 \in M, and let m=m_{p_0} be the D'Angelo type. If H: M \to S^{2N+1}\subset C^{N+1} is a CR map of class C^m, where S^{2N+1} denotes the boundary of the unit ball in C^{N+1 }, then H admits a holomorphic extension in a neighborhood of p_0.
