We show that for a certain family of integrable reversible transformations, the curves of periodic points of a general transformation cross the level curves of its integrals. This leads to the divergence of the normal form for a general reversible transformation with integrals. We also study the integrable holomorphic reversible transformations coming from real analytic surfaces in C^2 with non-degenerate complex tangents. We show the existence of real analytic surfaces with hyperbolic complex tangents, which are contained in a real hyperplane, but cannot be transformed into the Moser-Webster normal form through any holomorphic transformation.
