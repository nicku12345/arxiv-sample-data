We study the normalization of integrable analytic vector fields with a nilpotent linear part. We prove that such an analytic vector field can be transformed into a certain form by convergent transformations when it has a non-singular formal integral. In particular, we show that a formally linearizable analytic vector field with a nilpotent linear part is linearizable by convergent transformations. We then prove that there are smoothly linearizable parabolic analytic transformations which cannot be embedded into the flow of any analytic vector field with a nilpotent linear part.
