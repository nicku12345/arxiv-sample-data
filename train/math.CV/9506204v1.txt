We study the global invariants of real analytic manifolds in the complex space with respect to the group of holomorphic unimodular transformations. We consider only totally real manifolds which admits a certain fibration over the circle. We find a complete set of invariants for totally real tori in C^n which are close to the standard torus. The invariants are obtained by an analogous classification of complex-valued analytic n-forms on the standard torus. We also study the realization of certain exact complex-valued analytic n-forms on the standard torus through non-critical totally real embeddings.
