Let B_{\alpha}^{p} be the space of f holomorphic in the unit ball of \Bbb C^n such that (1-|z|^2)^\alpha f(z) \in L^p, where 0<p\leq\infty, \alpha\geq -1/p (weighted Bergman space). In this paper we study the interpolating sequences for various B_{\alpha}^{p}. The limiting cases \alpha=-1/p and p=\infty are respectively the Hardy spaces H^p and A^{-\alpha}, the holomorphic functions with polynomial growth of order \alpha, which have generated particular interest.   In \S 1 we first collect some definitions and well-known facts about weighted Bergman spaces and then introduce the natural interpolation problem, along with some basic properties. In \S 2 we describe in terms of \alpha and p the inclusions between B_{\alpha}^{p} spaces, and in \S 3 we show that most of these inclusions also hold for the corresponding spaces of interpolating sequences. \S 4 is devoted to sufficient conditions for a sequence to be B_{\alpha}^{p}-interpolating, expressed in the same terms as the conditions given in previous works of Thomas for the Hardy spaces and Massaneda for A^{-\alpha}. In particular we show, under some restrictions on \alpha and p, that finite unions of B_{\alpha}^{p}-interpolating sequences coincide with finite unions of separated sequences.   In his article in Inventiones, Seip implicitly gives a characterization of interpolating sequences for all weighted Bergman spaces in the disk. We spell out the details for the reader's convenience in an appendix (\S 5).
