In this paper we prove a general result of the ``Hopf lemma'' type for CR mappings, with nonidentically vanishing Jacobians, between real hypersurfaces in C^n with smooth or real analytic boundaries. Applications of this result to finiteness and holomorphic extendibility of such mappings are also given. The novelty here is that we make no assumption on the nonflatness of the mapping or its Jacobian, nor do we assume that the hypersurfaces are pseudoconvex or minimally convex.
