Let S be a generic submanifold of C^N of real codimension m. In this work we continue the study, carried over by various authors, of the set of analytic discs attached to S. Let M be the set of analytic discs attached to S. Given q \in S let M_q be the set of discs \phi in M such that \phi_(1). B. Trepreau and other authors gave sufficient conditions for M to be a manifold in a neighborhood of a given disc. We give conditions for M_q to be a manifold. When this conditions are satisfied we look at the map on M given by \phi \rightarrow \phi(0), and we describe the image of its differential, (in particular we determine its dimension). We then do the same for the map \phi \rightarrow \phi(-1) on M_q. For example we find as a corollary that if S has only minimal points, then there exists an open dense subset Omega in M such that the restriction of the map \phi \rightarrow \phi(0) to \Omega is an open map with value in C^N.
