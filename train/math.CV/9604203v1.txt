We shall prove that there are totally real and real analytic embeddings of S^k in \cc^n which are not biholomorphically equivalent if k\geq 5 and n=k+2[\frac{k-1}{4}]. We also show that a smooth manifold M admits a totally real immersion in \cc^n with a trivial complex normal bundle if and only if the complexified tangent bundle of M is trivial. The latter is proved by applying Gromov's weak homotopy equivalence principle for totally real immersions to Hirsch's transversal fields theory.
