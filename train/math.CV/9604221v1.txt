In 1927, Carleman showed that a continuous, complex-valued function on the real line can be approximated in the Whitney topology by an entire function restricted to the real line. In this paper, we prove a similar result for proper holomorphic embeddings. Namely, we show that a proper \cC^r embedding of the real line into \C^n can be approximated in the strong \cC^r topology by a proper holomorphic embedding of \C into \C^n.
