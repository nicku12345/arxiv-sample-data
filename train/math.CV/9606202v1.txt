Consider the Bergman kernel K^B(z) of the domain \ellip = \{z \in \Comp^n ; \sum_{j=1}^n |z_j|^{2m_j}<1 \}, where m=(m_1,\ldots,m_n) \in \Natl^n and m_n \neq 1. Let z^0 \in \partial \ellip be any weakly pseudoconvex point, k \in \Natl the degenerate rank of the Levi form at z^0. An explicit formula for K^B(z) modulo analytic functions is given in terms of the polar coordinates (t_1, \ldots, t_k, r) around z^0. This formula provides detailed information about the singularities of K^B(z), which improves the result of A. Bonami and N. Lohou\'e \cite{bol}. A similar result is established also for the Szeg\"o kernel K^S(z) of \ellip.
