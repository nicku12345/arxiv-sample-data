We propose two possible definitions for the notion of a sampling sequence (or set) for Hardy spaces of the disk. The first one is inspired by recent work of Bruna, Nicolau, and \O yma about interpolating sequences in the same spaces, and it yields sampling sets which do not depend on the value of p and correspond to the result proved for bounded functions (p=\infty) by Brown, Shields and Zeller. The second notion, while formally closer to the one used for weighted Bergman spaces, is shown to lead to trivial situations only, but raises a possibly interesting problem.
