In this paper we give an asymptotic expansion of the Bergman kernel for certain weakly pseudoconvex tube domains of finite type in C^2. Our asymptotic formula asserts that the singularity of the Bergman kernel at weakly pseudoconvex points is essentially expressed by using two variables; moreover certain real blowing-up is necessary to understand its singularity. The form of the asymptotic expansion with respect to each variable is similar to that in the strictly pseudoconvex case due to C. Fefferman. We also give an analogous result in the case of the Szego kernel.
