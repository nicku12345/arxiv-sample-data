The main purpose of this paper is to prove the following theorem on the defect relations for ample divisors of abelian varieties.   Main Theorem. Let A be an abelian variety of complex dimension n and D be an ample divisor in A. Let f:{\bf C}\rightarrow A be a holomorphic map. Then the defect for the map f and the divisor D is zero.   Corollary to Main Theorem. The complement of an ample divisor D in an abelian variety A is hyperbolic in the sense that there is no nonconstant holomorphic map from \bf C to A-D.
