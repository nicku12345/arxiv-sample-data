We survey results arising from the study of domains in C^n with non-compact automorphism group. Beginning with a well-known characterization of the unit ball, we develop ideas toward a consideration of weakly pseudoconvex (and even non-pseudoconvex) domains with particular emphasis on characterizations of (i) smoothly bounded domains with non-compact automorphism group and (ii) the Levi geometry of boundary orbit accumulation points.   Particular attention will be paid to results derived in the past ten years.
