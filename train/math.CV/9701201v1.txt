Let M be a real analytic hypersurface in \bC^N which is finitely nondegenerate, a notion that can be viewed as a generalization of Levi nondegenerate, at p_0\in M. We show that if M' is another such hypersurface and p'_0\in M', then the set of germs at p_0 of biholomorphisms H with H(M)\subset M' and H(p_0)=p'_0, equipped with its natural topology, can be naturally embedded as a real analytic submanifold in the complex jet group of \bC^N of the appropriate order. We also show that this submanifold is defined by equations that can be explicitly computed from defining equations of M and M'. Thus, (M,p_0) and (M',p'_0) are biholomorphically equivalent if and only if this (infinite) set of equations in the complex jet group has a solution.   Another result obtained in this paper is that any invertible formal map H that transforms (M,p_0) to (M',p'_0) is convergent. As a consequence, (M,p_0) and (M',p'_0) are biholomorphically equivalent if and only if they are formally equivalent.
