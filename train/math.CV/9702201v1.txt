In this paper we continue our study of a complex variables version of Hilbert's seventeenth problem by generalizing some of the results from [CD]. Given a bihomogeneous polynomial f of several complex variables that is positive away from the origin, we proved that there is an integer d so that ||z||^{2d} f(z,{\overline z}) is the squared norm of a holomorphic mapping. Thus, although f may not itself be a squared norm, it must be the quotient of squared norms of holomorphic homogeneous polynomial mappings. The proof required some operator theory on the unit ball. In the present paper we prove that we can replace the squared Euclidean norm by squared norms arising from an orthonormal basis for the space of homogeneous polynomials on any bounded circled pseudoconvex domain of finite type. To do so we prove a compactness result for an integral operator on such domains related to the Bergman kernel function.
