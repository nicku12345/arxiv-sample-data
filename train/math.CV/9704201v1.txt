In this article, we consider a bounded pseudoconvex domain in {\bf C}^2 satifying:   (a) it admits a proper holomorphic mapping f onto the unit ball B^2, and   (b) it is simply connected and has a real analytic boundary.   According to [Barletta-Bedford, Indiana U. Math. J, 39(1985), 315-338], the strong pseudconvexity of B^2 alone yields that such a domain is "weakly spherical" at the boundary points that are at the same time a smooth point of the branch locus Z_{df} = \{\det(J_{\bf C} f) = 0\}. (Notice that [Diederich-Fornaess, Math. Ann., 282 (1988), 681-700] implies that f as well as Z_{df} extends holomorphically across the boundaries.)   Our main contribution in this paper is that we have discovered a stronger rigidity (both local and global) in case the target domain is the unit ball. The main results are:   THEOREM ("Local Rigidity"): Let (M,o) be a real analytic normalized weakly spherical pointed CR hypersurface in {\bf C}^2 of order k_0 > 1. Let (\Sigma, o) be the pointed Siegel hypersurface given by the defining equation Re w - |z|^2 = 0. If there is a holomorphic mapping F:(M,o) \to (\Sigma,o) for which o is a regular branch point, then   (1) (M,o) is defined by the equation Re w - |z|^{2k_0} = 0, and   (2) F(z,w) is equivalent to (z,w) \mapsto (z^{k_0},w) up to a composition with elements in Aut (M,o) and Aut (\Sigma,o).   THEOREM ("Global Rigidity"): Let D and f:D \to B^2 be as above, and let f be generically m-to-1. Assume that its branch locus Z_{df} admits an analytic component V with the following properties:   (1) f is locally a m-to-1 branched covering with branch locus V at every point of V \cap \partial D;   (2) V \cap \partial D is connected and contains no singular point of the variety Z_{df}.   Then D is biholomorphic to E_m = \{|z|^{2m} + |w|^2 < 1\}.
