We prove an analogue of E. Levi's Continuity Principle for meromorphic mappings with values in arbitrary compact complex manifolds in place of the Riemann sphere \cc\pp^1. The result is achieved by introducing a new extension method for meromorphic mappings. One of the corollaries reads as follows:   If a compact complex surface X is not "among the known ones" then for every domain \Omega  in a Stein surface every meromorphic mapping f:\Omega \to X is in fact holomorphic and extends as a holomorphic mapping \hat f:\hat D\to X of the envelope of holomorphy \hat D of D into X.   In this last version also two examples of compact complex maniflds are described with meromoprhic mappings into these manifolds having thin but non-analytic singularity sets.
