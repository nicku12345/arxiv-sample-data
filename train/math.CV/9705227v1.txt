For a germ of a meromorphic function f=P/Q, we offer notions of the monodromy operators at zero and at infinity. If the holomorphic functions P and Q are non-degenerated with respect to their Newton diagrams, we give an analogue of the formula of Varchenko for the zeta-functions of these monodromy operators.
