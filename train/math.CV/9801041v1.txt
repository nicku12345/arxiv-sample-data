The topic of the paper is the study of germs of local holomorphisms f between C^n and C^{n'} such that f(M)\subset M' and df(T^cM)=T^cM' for M\subset C^n and M'\subset C^{n'} generic real-analytic CR submanifolds of arbitrary codimensions. It is proved that for M minimal and M' finitely nondegenerate, such germs depend analytically on their jets. As a corollary, an analytic structure on the set of all germs of this type is obtained.
