We show that the maximal prolongation of a certain algebra associated with a non-degenerate Hermitian form on {\Bbb C}^n\times{\Bbb C}^n with values in {\Bbb R}^k is canonically isomorphic to the Lie algebra of infinitesimal holomorphic automorphisms of the corresponding quadric in {\Bbb C}^{n+k}. This fact creates a link between different approaches to the equivalence problem for Levi-nondegenerate strongly uniform CR-manifolds.
