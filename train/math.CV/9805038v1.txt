Plemelj projection operators are introduced for spaces of square integrable functions defined over the boundaries of a class of compact real n-dimensional manifolds lying in C^n. These manifolds posses many properties similar to domains in R^n, and are consequently called domain manifolds. The key ingredients used here are techniques from both real and complex Clifford analysis. Analogues of the Kerzman-Stein kernel and Szego projection operators ar introduced, and their conformal covariance is described.
