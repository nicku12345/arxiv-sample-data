A notion of local indicator for a plurisubharmonic function is introduced. The indicator is a certain plurisubharmonic function in the unit polydisc, which controls the behavior of the considered function near a fixed point of its singularity, as well as the residual Monge-Ampere mass of the function at this point. A pluricomplex Green function with respect to given indicators is constructed and applied to the Dirichlet problem for the Monge- Ampere operator in the class of plurisubharmonic functions with isolated singularities.
