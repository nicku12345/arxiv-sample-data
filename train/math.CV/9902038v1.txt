Let M be a generic CR submanifold in \C^{m+n}, m= CRdim M \geq 1,n=codim M \geq 1, d=dim M = 2m+n. A CR meromorphic mapping (in the sense of Harvey-Lawson) is a triple (f,{\cal D}_f, [\Gamma_f]), where: 1. f: {\cal D}_f \to Y is a {\cal C}^1-smooth mapping defined over a dense open subset {\cal D}_f of M with values in a projective manifold Y; 2. The closure \Gamma_f of its graph in \C^{m+n} \times Y defines a oriented scarred {\cal C}^1-smooth CR manifold of CR dimension m (i.e. CR outside a closed thin set) and 3. Such that d[\Gamma_f]=0 in the sense of currents. We prove in this paper that (f,{\cal D}_f, [\Gamma_f]) extends meromorphically to a wedge attached to M if M is everywhere minimal and {\cal C}^{\omega} (real analytic) or if M is a {\cal C}^{2,\alpha} globally minimal hypersurface.
