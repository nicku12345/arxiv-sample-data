The main objective of this paper is to prove a new inequality for plurisubharmonic functions estimating their supremum over a ball by their supremum over a measurable subset of the ball. We apply this result to study local properties of polynomial, algebraic and analytic functions. The paper has much in common with an earlier paper of the author.
