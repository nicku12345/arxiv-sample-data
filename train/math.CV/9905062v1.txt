We study the masses charged by (dd^cu)^n at isolated singularity points of plurisubharmonic functions u. It is done by means of the local indicators of plurisubharmonic functions. As a consequence, bounds for the masses are obtained in terms of the directional Lelong numbers of u, and the notion of the Newton number for a holomorphic mapping is extended to arbitrary plurisubharmonic functions. We also describe the local indicator of u as the logarithmic tangent to u.
