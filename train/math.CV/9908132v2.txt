The Jensen envelope J\phi of an upper semicontinuous function \phi on a complex manifold X is defined at x\in X as the infimum of \mu(\phi) over all Jensen measures \mu centred at x. The Poisson envelope P\phi is defined by using only the boundary measures of analytic discs centred at x. One of the main open problems in the theory of disc functionals is whether the Poisson envelope is plurisubharmonic on an arbitrary manifold. This is equivalent to the two envelopes being equal, so plurisubharmonicity of J\phi is a necessary condition for P\phi to be plurisubharmonic. We prove that the Jensen envelope is plurisubharmonic, with no assumptions on the manifold X. Hence J\phi is the largest plurisubharmonic function smaller than \phi. We also show that the Poisson envelope is plurisubharmonic if and only if boundary measures of analytic discs are dense among Jensen measures.
