We consider manifolds equipped with a foliation \cal F of codimension 4q, and an almost quaternionic structure Q on the transversal bundle of {\cal F}. After discussing conditions of projectability and integrability of Q, we study the transversal twistor space Z{\cal F} which, by definition, consists of the Q-compatible almost complex structures. We show that Z{\cal F} can be endowed with a lifted foliation {\hat {\cal F}} and two natural almost complex structures J_1, J_2 on the transversal bundle of \hat{\cal F}. We establish the conditions which ensure the projectability of J_1 and J_2, and the integrability of J_{1} (J_{2} is never integrable).
