It is shown how the well-known class of bihamiltonian structures in general position can be extended to a wider class. A generalization of the corresponding notion of a Veronese web for this wider class is presented (in the general position case Veronese webs form complete systems of local invariants for bihamiltonian structures). Some examples are considered.
