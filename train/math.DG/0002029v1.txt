We study complex 4-manifolds with holomorphic self-dual conformal structures, and we obtain an interpretation of the Weyl tensor of such a manifold as the projective curvature of a field of cones on the ambitwistor space. In particular, its vanishing is implied by the existence of some compact, simply-connected, null-geodesics. We also relate the Cotton-York tensor of an umbilic hypersurface to the Weyl tensor of the ambient. As a consequence, a conformal 3-manifold or a self-dual 4-manifold admitting a rational curve as a null-geodesic is conformally flat. We show that the projective structure of the beta-surfaces of a self-dual manifold is flat.
