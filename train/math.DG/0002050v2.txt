We consider F: M \to N a minimal oriented compact real 2n-submanifold M, immersed into a Kaehler-Einstein manifold N of complex dimension 2n, and scalar curvature R. We assume that n \geq 2 and F has equal Kaehler angles. Our main result is to prove that, if n = 2 and R \neq 0, then F is either a complex submanifold or a Lagrangian submanifold. We also prove that, if n \geq 3 and F has no complex points, then: (A) If R < 0, then F is Lagrangian; (B) If R = 0, the Kaehler angle must be constant. We also study pluriminimal submanifolds with equal Kaehler angles, and prove that, if they are not complex submanifolds, N must be Ricci-flat and there is a natural parallel homothetic isomorphism between TM and the normal bundle.
