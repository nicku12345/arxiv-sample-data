A weight system on graph homology was constructed by Rozansky and Witten using a compact hyperk\"ahler manifold. A variation of this construction utilizing holomorphic vector bundles over the manifold gives a weight system on chord diagrams. We investigate these weights from the hyperk\"ahler geometry point of view.
