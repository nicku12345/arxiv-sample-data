Given two points of a Generalized Robertson-Walker spacetime, the existence, multiplicity and causal character of geodesic connecting them is characterized. Conjugate points of such geodesics are related to conjugate points of geodesics on the fiber, and Morse-type relations are obtained. Applications to bidimensional spacetimes and to GRW spacetimes satisfying the timelike convergence condition are also found.
