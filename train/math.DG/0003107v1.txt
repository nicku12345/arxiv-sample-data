I have chosen, in this presentation of Deformation Quantization, to focus on 3 points: the uniqueness --up to equivalence-- of a universal star product (universal in the sense of Kontsevich) on the dual of a Lie algebra, the cohomology classes introduced by Deligne for equivalence classes of differential star products on a symplectic manifold and the construction of some convergent star products on Hermitian symmetric spaces. Those subjects will appear in a promenade through the history of existence and equivalence in deformation quantization.
