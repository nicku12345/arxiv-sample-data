We provide a local classification of self-dual Einstein Riemannian four manifolds admitting a positively oriented Hermitian structure and characterize those which carry a hyperhermitian, non-hyperk\"ahlerian structure compatible with the negative orientation. We finally show that self-dual Einstein 4-manifolds obtained as quaternionic quotients of the Wolf spaces {\mathbb H}P^2, {\mathbb H}H^2, SU(4)/S(U(2)U(2)), and SU(2,2)/S(U(2)U(2)) are always Hermitian.
