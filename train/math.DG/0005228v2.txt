We classify the semi-Riemannian submersions from a pseudo-hyperbolic space onto a Riemannian manifold under the assumption that the fibres are connected and totally geodesic. Also we obtain the classification of the semi-Riemannian submersions from a complex pseudo-hyperbolic space onto a Riemannian manifold under the assumption that the fibres are complex, connected and totally geodesic submanifolds.
