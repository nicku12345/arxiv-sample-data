We generalize the hyperkaehler quotient construction to the situation where there is no group action preserving the hyperkaehler structure but for each complex structure there is an action of a complex group preserving the corresponding complex symplectic structure. Many (known and new) hyperkaehler manifolds arise as quotients in this setting. For example, all hyperkaehler structures on semisimple coadjoint orbits of a complex semisimple Lie group G arise as such quotients of T^*G. The generalized Legendre transform construction of Lindstroem and Rocek is also explained in this framework.
