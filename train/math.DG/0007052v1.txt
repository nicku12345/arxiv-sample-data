We present a generalization of the Clifford action for other representations spaces of Spin(n), which is called the Clifford homomorphism. Their properties extend to the ones for the higher spin Dirac operators on spin manifolds. In particular, we have general Bochner identities for them, and an eigenvalue estimate of a Laplace type operator on any associated bundle.
