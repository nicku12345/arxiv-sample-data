Let X be a smooth closed oriented non-spin 4-manifold with even intersection form kE_8\oplus nH. In this article we show that n\geq |k| on X. Thus we confirm the 10/8-conjecture affirmatively. As an application, we also give an estimate of intersection forms of spin coverings of non-spin 4-manifolds with even intersection forms.
