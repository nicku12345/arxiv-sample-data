The geometry of submanifolds is intimately related to the theory of functions and vector bundles. It has been of fundamental importance to find out how those two objects interact in many geometric and physical problems. A typical example of this relation is that the Picard group of line bundles on an algebraic manifold is isomorphic to the group of divisors, which is generated by holomorphic hypersurfaces modulo linear equivalence. A similar correspondence can be made between the K-group of sheaves and the Chow ring of holomorphic cycles. There are two more very recent examples of such a relation. The mirror symmetry in string theory has revealed a deeper phenomenon involving special Lagrangian cycles (cf. [SYZ]). On the other hand, C. Taubes has shown that the Seiberg-Witten invariant coincides with the Gromov-Witten invariant on any symplectic 4-manifolds.   In this paper, we will show another natural interaction between Yang-Mills connections, which are critical points of a Yang-Mills action associated to a vector bundle, and minimal submanifolds, which have been studied extensively for years in classical differential geometry and the calculus of variations.
