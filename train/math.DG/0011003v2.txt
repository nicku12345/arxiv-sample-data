The paper developes a geometrization of a Kronecker h-regular vertical fundamental metrical d-tensor G^{(\alpha)(\beta)}_{(i)(j)} on the jet fibre bundle of order one J^1(T,M). This geometrization gives a mathematical model for both gravitational and electromagnetic field theory, in a general setting. In this context, the Einstein and Maxwell equations are described.
