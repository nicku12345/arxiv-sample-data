Helfer in [Pacific J. Math. 164/2 (1994), p. 321--350] was the first to produce an example of a spacelike Lorentzian geodesic with a continuum of conjugate points. In this paper we show the following result: given an interval [a,b] of IR and any closed subset F of IR contained in ]a,b], then there exists a Lorentzian manifold (M,g) and a spacelike geodesic \gamma:[a,b]\to M such that \gamma(t) is conjugate to \gamma(a) along \gamma iff t\in F.
