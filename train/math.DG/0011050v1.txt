We characterize compact locally conformally K\"ahler (l.c.K.) manifolds under the assumption of a purely conformal, holomorphic circle action. As an application, we determine the structure of the compact l.c.K. manifolds with parallel Lee form. We introduce the Lee-Cauchy-Riemann (LCR) transformations as a class of diffeomorphisms preserving the specific G-structure of l.c.K. manifolds. Then we characterize the Hopf manifolds, up to holomorphic isometry, as compact l.c.K. manifolds admitting a certain closed LCR action of \mathbb{C}^*.
