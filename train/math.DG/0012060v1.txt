This is the fourth in a series of papers math.DG/0008021, math.DG/0008155, math.DG/0010036 constructing explicit examples of special Lagrangian submanifolds (SL m-folds) in C^m. A submanifold of C^m is ruled if it is fibred by a family of real straight lines in C^m. This paper studies ruled special Lagrangian 3-folds in C^3, giving both general theory and families of examples. Our results are related to previous work of Harvey and Lawson, Borisenko and Bryant.   An important class of ruled SL 3-folds is the special Lagrangian cones in C^3. Each ruled SL 3-fold is asymptotic to a unique SL cone. We study the family of ruled SL 3-folds N asymptotic to a fixed SL cone N_0. We find that this depends on solving a linear equation, so that the family of such N has the structure of a vector space. We also show that the intersection Sigma of N_0 with the unit sphere in C^3 is a Riemann surface, and construct a ruled SL 3-fold N asymptotic to N_0 for each holomorphic vector field w on Sigma.   As corollaries of this we write down two large families of explicit SL 3-folds depending on a holomorphic function on C, which include many new examples of singularities of SL 3-folds. We also show that each SL T^2 cone N_0 can be extended to a 2-parameter family of ruled SL 3-folds asymptotic to N_0, and diffeomorphic to T^2 x R.
