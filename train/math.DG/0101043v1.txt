We consider systems (M,\omega,g) with M a closed smooth manifold, \omega a real valued closed one form and g a Riemannian metric, so that (\omega,g) is a Morse-Smale pair, Definition~2. We introduce a numerical invariant \rho(\omega,g)\in[0,\infty] and improve Morse-Novikov theory by showing that the Novikov complex comes from a cochain complex of free modules over a subring \Lambda'_{[\omega],\rho} of the Novikov ring \Lambda_{[\omega]} which admits surjective ring homomorphisms \ev_s:\Lambda'_{[\omega],\rho}\to\C for any complex number s whose real part is larger than \rho. We extend Witten-Helffer-Sj\"ostrand results from a pair (h,g) where h is a Morse function to a pair (\omega,g) where \omega is a Morse one form. As a consequence we show that if \rho<\infty the Novikov complex can be entirely recovered from the spectral geometry of (M,\omega,g).
