Let M be either a projective manifold (M,Pi) or a pseudo-Riemannian manifold (M,g). We extend, intrinsically, the projective/conformal Schwarzian derivatives that we have introduced recently, to the space of differential operators acting on symmetric contravariant tensor fields of any degree on M. As operators, we show that the projective/conformal Schwarzian derivatives depend only on the projective connection Pi and the conformal class [g] of the metric, respectively. Furthermore, we compute the first cohomology group of Vect(M) with coefficients into the space of symmetric contravariant tensor fields valued into delta-densities as well as the corresponding relative cohomology group with respect to sl(n+1,R).
