We propose a twistor construction of surfaces in Lie sphere geometry based on the linear system which copies equations of Wilczynski's projective frame. In the particular case of Lie-applicable surfaces this linear system describes joint eigenfunctions of a pair of commuting Schr\"odinger operators with magnetic fields.
