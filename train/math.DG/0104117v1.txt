It was pointed out that the space of hermitian triples is an anology of the hermitian connection space. Generalizing the Ashtekar - Isham procedure one can quantize the space of hermitian triples as well as the original one. Here we add an example how this similarity can be exploited in a quantum theory of riemannian geometry.
