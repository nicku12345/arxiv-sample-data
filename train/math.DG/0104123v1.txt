We show that Jacobi fields along harmonic maps between suitable spaces preserve conformality, holomorphicity, real isotropy and complex isotropy to first order; this last being one of the key tools in the proof by Lemaire and the author of integrability of Jacobi fields along harmonic maps from the 2-sphere to the complex projective plane.
