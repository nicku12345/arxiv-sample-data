Let {\cal F}_\lambda be the space of tensor densities on {\bf R}^n of degree \lambda (or, equivalently, of conformal densities of degree -\lambda{}n) considered as a module over the Lie algebra so(p+1,q+1). We classify so(p+1,q+1)-invariant bilinear differential operators from {\cal F}_\lambda\otimes{\cal F}_\mu to~{\cal F}_\nu. The classification of linear so(p+1,q+1)-invariant differential operators from {\cal F}_\lambda to {\cal F}_\mu already known in the literature is obtained in a different manner.
