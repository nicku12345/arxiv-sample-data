We study affine maps between affine manifolds. Even when the fibers are compact and diffeomorphic, two of them can inherit different affine structures from the source space. This leads to a fixed linear holonomy deformation theory of the affine structure of an affine manifold. We found various conditions which make the fibers to be affinely isomorphic. We also classify affine bundles which total space is a compact and complete affine manifold.
