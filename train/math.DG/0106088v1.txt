For a real valued periodic smooth function u on R, n\ge 0, one defines the osculating polynomial \phi_s (of order 2n+1) at a point s\in R to be the unique trigonometric polynomial of degree n, whose value and first 2n derivatives at s coincide with those of u at s. We will say that a point s is a clean maximal flex (resp. clean minimal flex) of the function u on S^1 if and only if \phi_s\ge u (resp. \phi_s\le u) and the preimage (\phi-u)^{-1}(0) is connected. We prove that any smooth periodic function u has at least n+1 clean maximal flexes of order 2n+1 and at least n+1 clean minimal flexes of order 2n+1. The assertion is clearly reminiscent of Morse theory and generalizes the classical four vertex theorem for convex plane curves.
