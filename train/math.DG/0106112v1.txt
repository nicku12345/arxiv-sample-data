Any Kaehler metric on the ball which is strongly asymptotic to complex hyperbolic space and whose scalar curvature is no less than the one of the complex hyperbolic space must be isometrically biholomorphic to it. This result has been known for some time in odd complex dimension and we provide here a proof in even dimension.
