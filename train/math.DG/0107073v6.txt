We prove that there are no pseudoholomorphic theories of anything other than curves, even if one allows more general spaces than almost complex manifolds. The proof is elementary, except for theories of pseudoholomorphic hypersurfaces, where topological techniques are needed. Surprisingly, hypersurface theories exist ``microlocally'' (in great abundance) to all orders perturbatively, but not ``locally.''
