We construct a connection and a curving on a bundle gerbe associated with lifting a structure group of a principal bundle to a central extension. The construction is based on certain structures on the bundle, i.e. connections and splittings. The Deligne cohomology class of the lifting bundle gerbe with the connection and with the curving coincides with the obstruction class of the lifting problem with these structures.
