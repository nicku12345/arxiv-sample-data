In this paper, we study the limiting properties of the K energy for smooth hypersurfaces in the projective spaces. Our result generalizes the result of Ding-Tian (W. Ding and G. Tian. K\"ahler-Einstein metrics and the generalized Futaki invariant. {\em Invent Math}, 110:315-335, 1992.) in the case of hypersurfaces. In particular, we allow the center fiber of a special degeneration (a degeneration by a one-parameter group) to have multiplicity great than 1.
