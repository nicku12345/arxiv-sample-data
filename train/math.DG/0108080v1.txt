A classical result of Sampson and Schoen-Yau in 1978 states that every diffeomorphism between compact hyperbolic Riemann surfaces is homotopic to an harmonic diffeomorphism. As conjectured by Schoen in 1993 and partially proved by Wan in 1992 and Tam-Wan in 1995, we prove in this article that this theorem generalizes to the non compact case : every quasi symmetric homeomorphism of the circle extends to a quasi isometric harmonic diffeomorphism of the hyperbolic plane. This enables to parametrize the universal Teichmuller space by bounded holomorphic quadratric differentials of the hyperbolic plane.
