We establish a correspondence between Darboux's special isothermic surfaces of type (A,0,C,D) and the solutions of the second order PDE : u\Delta(u)-|\nabla(u)|^{2}+\Phi^{4}=s, s \in R. We then use the classical Darboux transformation for isothermic surfaces to construct a B\"acklund transformation for this equation and prove a superposition formula for its solutions. As an application we discuss 1 and 2-soliton solutions and the corresponding surfaces.
