We describe a simple way of constructing torus fibrations T^3\to X\to S^3 which degenerate canonically over a knot or link in S^3. We show that the topological invariants of X can be computed algebraically from the monodromy representation of the fibration. We use this to obtain some new T^3-fibrations S^3\times S^3\to S^3 and (S^3\times S^3)#(S^3\times S^3)#(S^4\times S^2) \to S^3 whose discriminant locus is a torus knot.
