We show the total space of the canonical line bundle \mathbb{L} of a Kahler-Einstein manifold X^n supports integrable SU(n+1) structures, or Calabi-Yau structures. The canonical real line bundle L \subset \mathbb{L} over a minimal Lagrangian submanifold M \subset X is calibrated in this setting and hence can be considered as the special Lagrangian lift of M.   For the integrable G_2 and Spin(7) structures on spin bundles and bundles of anti-self-dual 2-forms on self-dual Einstein 4-manifolds constructed by Bryant and Salamon, minimal surfaces with vanishing complex quartic form (super-minimal) admit lifts which are calibrated, i.e., associative, coassociative or Cayley respectively. The lifts in this case can be considered as the tangential lifts or normal lifts of the minimal surface adapted to the quaternionic bundle structure.
