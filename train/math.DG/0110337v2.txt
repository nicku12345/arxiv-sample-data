Let (M,g) be a pseudo-Riemannian manifold. We propose a new approach for defining the conformal Schwarzian derivatives. These derivatives are 1-cocycles on the group of diffeomorphisms of M related to the modules of linear differential operators. As operators, these derivatives do not depend on the rescaling of the metric g. In particular, if the manifold (M,g) is conformally flat, these derivatives vanish on the conformal group \Og(p+1,q+1), where \mathrm{dim} (M)=p+q. This work is a continuation of [1,4] where the Schwarzian derivative was defined on a manifold endowed with a projective connection.
