This paper constructs a family of conformally invariant differential operators acting on spinor densities with leading part a power of the Dirac operator. The construction applies for all powers in odd dimensions, and only for finitely many powers in even dimensions. These operators arise naturally as obstructions to formal solution of the Dirac equation on the Fefferman-Graham ambient space with prescribed boundary conditions.
