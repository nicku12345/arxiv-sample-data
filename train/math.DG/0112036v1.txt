We review the basic definitions and properties concerning smooth structures, convenient spaces, diffeological spaces and tangent structures. The relation betwen them is described. A tangent structure is constructed for each pre-convenient space. This one is proved to be convenient iff the space and the tangent fibres coincide. Some basic comments on the relation with manifolds are given.
