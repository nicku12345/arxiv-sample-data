The spectrum of the Laplace-Dolbeault operator for any line bundle with parallel curvature on a flat complex torus is computed. The Ray-Singer analytic torsion is then deduced, generalizing thus Bost's result for ample line bundles and Ray-Singer's ones for flat bundles, of which we a geometric interpretation is given.
