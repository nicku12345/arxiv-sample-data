We study HKT structures on nilpotent Lie groups and on associated nilmanifolds. We exhibit three weak HKT structures on \R^8 which are homogeneous with respect to extensions of Heisenberg type Lie groups. The corresponding hypercomplex structures are of a special kind, called abelian. We prove that on any 2-step nilpotent Lie group all invariant HKT structures arise from abelian hypercomplex structures. Furthermore, we use a correspondence between abelian hypercomplex structures and subspaces of {\frak sp}(n) to produce continuous families of compact and noncompact of manifolds carrying non isometric HKT structures. Finally, geometrical properties of invariant HKT structures on 2-step nilpotent Lie groups are obtained.
