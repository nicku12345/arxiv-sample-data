We shall obtain unobstructed deformations of four geometric structures: Calabi-Yau, HyperK\"ahler, \G and Spin(7) structures in terms of closed differential forms (calibrations). We develop a direct and unified construction of smooth moduli spaces of these four geometric structures and show that the local Torelli type theorem holds in a systematic way.
