We prove the existence of complete, embedded, constant mean curvature 1 surfaces in 3 dimensional hyperbolic space when g, the genus of the surface, and n, the number of ends of the surface, satisfy either g=0 and n\geq 1 or g \geq 1 and 2n\geq g+5. The surfaces are all regular points of their corresponding moduli space.
