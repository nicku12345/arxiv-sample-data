The minimal surface equation Q in the second order contact bundle of R^3, modulo translations, is provided with a complex structure and a canonical vector-valued holomorphic differential form Omega on Q\0. The minimal surfaces M in R^3 correspond to the complex analytic curves C in Q, where the derivative of the Gauss map sends M to C, and M is equal to the real part of the integral of \Omega over C. The complete minimal surfaces of finite topological type and with flat points at infinity correspond to the algebraic curves in Q.
