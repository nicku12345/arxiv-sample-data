In this paper, which is a sequel to math.DG/9902111, we analyze the limit of the p-form Laplacian under a collapse with bounded sectional curvature and bounded diameter to a singular limit space. As applications, we give results about upper and lower bounds on the j-th eigenvalue of the p-form Laplacian, in terms of sectional curvature and diameter.
