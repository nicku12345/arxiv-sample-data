We introduce self-dual manifolds and show that they can be used to encode mirror symmetry for affine-K\"{a}hler manifolds and for elliptic curves. Their geometric properties, especially the link with special lagrangian fibrations and the existence of a transformation similar to the Fourier-Mukai functor, suggest that this approach may be able to explain mirror symmetry also in other situations
