The space {\mathcal A} of almost complex structures on a closed manifold M is studied. A natural parametrization of the space {\mathcal A} is defined. It is shown, that {\mathcal A} is a infinite dimensional complex weak Pseudo-Riemannian manifold. A curvature of the space {\mathcal A} is found. The space {\mathcal A}_\omega of associated almost complex structures on a symplectic manifold M,\omega and space {\mathcal AO} of orthogonal almost complex structures on a Riemannian manifold M,g_0 are considered in more detail.
