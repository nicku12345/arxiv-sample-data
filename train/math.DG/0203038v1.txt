We consider strict and complete nearly Kaehler manifolds with the canonical Hermitian connection. The holonomy representation of the canonical Hermitian connection is studied. We show that a strict and complete nearly Kaehler is locally a Riemannian product of homogenous nearly Kaehler spaces, twistor spaces over quaternionic Kaehler manifolds and 6-dimensional nearly Kaehler manifolds. As an application we obtain structure results for totally geodesic Riemannian foliations admitting a compatible Kaehler structure. Finally, we obtain a classification result for the homogenous case, reducing a conjecture of Wolf and Gray to its 6-dimensional form.
