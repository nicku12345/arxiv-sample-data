Let G be a Lie group with Lie algebra  \Cal G: = T_\epsilon G and T^*G = \Cal G^* \rtimes G its cotangent bundle considered as a Lie group, where G acts on \Cal G^* via the coadjoint action.   We show that there is a 1-1 correspondance between the skew-symmetric solutions r\in \wedge^2 \Cal G of the Classical Yang-Baxter Equation in G, and the set of connected Lie subgroups of T^*G which carry a left invariant affine structure and whose Lie algebras are lagrangian graphs in  \Cal G \oplus \Cal G^*.   An invertible solution r endows G with a left invariant symplectic structure and hence a left invariant affine structure. In this case we prove that the Poisson Lie tensor \pi := r^+ - r^- is polynomial of degree at most 2 and the double Lie groups of (G,\pi) also carry a canonical left invariant affine structure.   In the general case of (non necessarly invertible) solutions r, we supply a necessary and suffisant condition to the geodesic completness of the associated affine structure
