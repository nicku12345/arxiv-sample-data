We extend the calculus of adiabatic pseudo-differential operators to study the adiabatic limit behavior of the eta and zeta functions of a differential operator \delta, constructed from an elliptic family of operators indexed by S^1. We show that the regularized values {\eta}(\delta_t,0) and t{\zeta}(\delta_t,0) are smooth functions of t at t=0, and we identify their values at t=0 with the holonomy of the determinant bundle, respectively with a residue trace. For invertible families of operators, the functions {\eta}(\delta_t,s) and t{\zeta}(\delta_t,s) are shown to extend smoothly to t=0 for all values of s. After normalizing with a Gamma factor, the zeta function satisfies in the adiabatic limit an identity reminiscent of the Riemann zeta function, while the eta function converges to the volume of the Bismut-Freed meromorphic family of connection 1-forms.
