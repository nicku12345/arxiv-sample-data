This note discusses the higher K-energy functionals which were defined by Bando and Mabuchi, and integrate higher Futaki invariants. Two new formulas for the higher K-energy functionals are given, and the second K-energy is shown to be related to Donaldson's Lagrangian applied to metrics on the tangent bundle.
