We study a multiply warped products manifold associated with the Reissner-Nordstrom metric to investigate the physical properties inside the black hole event horizons. It is shown that, different from the uncharged Schwarzschild metric, the Ricci curvature components inside the Reissner-Nordstrom black hole horizons are nonvanishing, while the Einstein scalar curvature vanishes even in the interior of the charged metric. Introducing a perfect fluid inside the Reissor-Nordstrom black hole, it is also shown that the charge plays effective roles of decreasing the mass-energy density and the pressure of the fluid inside the black hole.
