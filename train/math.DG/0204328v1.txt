A special K\"ahler-Ricci potential on a K\"ahler manifold is any nonconstant C^\infty function \tau such that J(\nabla\tau) is a Killing vector field and, at every point with d\tau\ne 0, all nonzero tangent vectors orthogonal to \nabla\tau and J(\nabla\tau) are eigenvectors of both \nabla d\tau and the Ricci tensor. For instance, this is always the case if \tau is a nonconstant C^\infty function on a K\"ahler manifold (M,g) of complex dimension m>2 and the metric \tilde g=g/\tau^2, defined wherever \tau\ne 0, is Einstein. (When such \tau exists, (M,g) may be called {\it almost-everywhere conformally Einstein}.) We provide a complete classification of compact K\"ahler manifolds with special K\"ahler-Ricci potentials and use it to prove a structure theorem for compact K\"ahler manifolds of any complex dimension m>2 which are almost-everywhere conformally Einstein.
