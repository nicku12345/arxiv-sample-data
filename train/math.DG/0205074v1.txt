We show that any k Osserman Lorentzian algebraic curvature tensor has constant sectional curvature and give an elementary proof that any local 2 point homogeneous Lorentzian manifold has constant sectional curvature. We also show that a Szab\'o Lorentzian covariant derivative algebraic curvature tensor vanishes.
