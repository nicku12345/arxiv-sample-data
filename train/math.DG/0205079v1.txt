We classify the connected pseudo-Riemannian manifolds of signature (p,q) with q\ge5 so that at each point of M the skew-symmetric curvature operator has constant rank 2 and constant Jordan normal form on the set of spacelike 2 planes and so that the skew-symmetric curvature operator is not nilpotent for at least one point of M.
