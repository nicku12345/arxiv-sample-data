We show that the natural S^1-bundle over a projective special Kaehler manifold carries the geometry of a proper affine hypersphere endowed with a Sasakian structure. The construction generalizes the geometry of the Hopf-fibration \Sr^{2n+1} \longrightarrow \CP^n in the context of projective special Kaehler manifolds. As an application we have that a natural circle bundle over the Kuranishi moduli space of a Calabi-Yau threefold is a Lorentzian proper affine hypersphere.
