Following the point of view of Gray and Hervella, we derive detailed conditions which characterize each one of the classes of almost quaternion-Hermitian 4n-manifolds, n>1. Previously, by completing a basic result of A. Swann, we give explicit descriptions of the tensors contained in the space of covariant derivatives of the fundamental form \Omega and split the coderivative of \Omega into its {\sl Sp}(n){\sl Sp}(1)-components. For 4n>8, A. Swann also proved that all the information about the intrinsic torsion \nabla \Omega is contained in the exterior derivative {\sl d} \Omega. Thus, we give alternative conditions, expressed in terms of {\sl d} \Omega, to characterize the different classes of almost quaternion-Hermitian manifolds.
