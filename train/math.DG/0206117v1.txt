Conformal Killing forms are a natural generalization of conformal vector fields on Riemannian manifolds. They are defined as sections in the kernel of a conformally invariant first order differential operator. We show the existence of conformal Killing forms on nearly Kaehler and weak G_2-manifolds. Moreover, we give a complete description of special conformal Killing forms. A further result is a sharp upper bound on the dimension of the space of conformal Killing forms.
