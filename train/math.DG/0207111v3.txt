We give a topological interpretation of the space of L2-harmonic forms on finite-volume manifolds with sufficiently pinched negative curvature. We give examples showing that this interpretation fails if the curvature is not sufficiently pinched and that our result is sharp with respect to the pinching constants. The method consists first in comparing L2-cohomology with weighted L2-cohomology thanks to previuos works done by T. Ohsawa, and then in identifying these weighted spaces.
