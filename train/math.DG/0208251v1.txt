The space of differential operators acting on skewsymmetric tensor fields or on smooth forms of a smooth manifold are representations of its Lie algebra of vector fields. We compute the first cohomology spaces of these representations and show how they are related to the cohomology with coefficients in ther space of smooth functions of the manifold.
