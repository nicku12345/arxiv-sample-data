Let Z be a smooth projective manifold. In these notes I will prove that the K-group of R-constructible sheaves is isomorphic to the free abelian group with one generator for each open semialgebraic subset U (which I will denote by the same letter) modulo the Mayer-Vietoris relations: U + V - U^V - UvV = 0.   I will prove it by showing that both groups in question are isomorphic to the group of all integer-valued semialgebraic functions on Z.
