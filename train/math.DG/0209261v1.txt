Given a 1-parameter family of 1-forms \g(t)= \g_0+t\g_1+...+t^n\g_n, consider the condition d\g(t)\wedge\g(t)=0 (of integrability for the annihilated by \g(t) distribution w(t)). We prove that in order that this condition is satisfied for any t it is sufficient that it is satisfied for N=n+3 different values of t (the corresponding implication for N=2n+1 is obvious). In fact we give a stronger result dealing with distributions of higher codimension. This result is related to the so-called Veronese webs and can be applied in the theory of bihamiltonian structures.
