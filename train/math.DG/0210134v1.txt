We classify the Lagrangian orientable surfaces in complex space forms with the property that the ellipse of curvature is always a circle. As a consequence, we obtain new characterizations of the Clifford torus of the complex projective plane and of the Whitney spheres in the complex projective, complex Euclidean and complex hyperbolic planes.
