Let x:M\to S^{n+p} be an n-dimensional submanifold in an (n+p)-dimensional unit sphere S^{n+p}, x:M\to S^{n+p} is called a Willmore submanifold to the following Willmore functional:  \int_M(S-nH^2)^{\frac{n}{2}}dv,  where S=\sum\limits_{\alpha,i,j}(h^\alpha_{ij})^2 is the square of the length of the second fundamental form, H is the mean curvature of M. In [13], author proved an integral inequality of Simon's type for n-dimensional compact Willmore hypersurfaces in S^{n+1} and gave a characterization of {\it Willmore tori}. In this paper, we generalize this result to n-dimensional compact Willmore submanifolds in S^{n+p}. In fact, we obtain an integral inequality of Simon's type for compact Willmore submanifolds in S^{n+p} and give a characterization of {\it willmore tori} and {\it Veronese surface} by use of integral inequality.
