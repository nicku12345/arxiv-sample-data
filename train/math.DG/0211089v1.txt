We show that if \nabla R is a Jordan Szabo algebraic covariant derivative curvature tensor on a vector space of signature (p,q), where q is odd and p is less than q or if q is congruent to 2 mod 4 and if p is less than q-1, then \nabla R=0. This algebraic result yields an elementary proof of the geometrical fact that any pointwise totally isotropic pseudo-Riemannian manifold with such a signature (p,q) is locally symmetric.
