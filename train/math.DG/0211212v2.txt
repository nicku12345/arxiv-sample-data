Orbits of families of vector fields on a subcartesian space are shown to be smooth manifolds. This allows for a global description of a smooth geometric structure on a family of manifolds in terms of a single object defined on the corresponding family of vector fields. Stratified spaces, Poisson spaces and almost complex spaces are discussed.
