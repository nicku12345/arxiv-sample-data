We prove that a complete noncompact K\"{a}hler manifold M^{n}of positive bisectional curvature satisfying suitable growth conditions is biholomorphic to a pseudoconvex domain of {\bf C}^{n} and we show that the manifold is topologically {\bf R}^{2n}. In particular, when M^{n} is a K\"{a}hler surface of positive bisectional curvature satisfying certain natural geometric growth conditions, it is biholomorphic to {\bf C}^{2}.
