In this paper, by combining techniques from Ricci flow and algebraic geometry, we prove the following generalization of the classical uniformization theorem of Riemann surfaces. Given a complete noncompact complex two dimensional K\"ahler manifold M of positive and bounded holomorphic bisectional curvature, suppose its geodesic balls have Euclidean volume growth and its scalar curvature decays to zero at infinity in the average sense, then M is biholomorphic to \C^2. During the proof, we also discover an interesting gap phenomenon which says that a K\"ahler manifold as above automatically has quadratic curvature decay at infinity in the average sense.
