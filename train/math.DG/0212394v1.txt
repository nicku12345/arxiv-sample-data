In the study of conformal geometry, the method of elliptic partial differential equations is playing an increasingly significant role. Since the solution of the Yamabe problem, a family of conformally covariant operators (for definition, see section 2) generalizing the conformal Laplacian, and their associated conformal invariants have been introduced. The conformally covariant powers of the Laplacian form a family P_{2k} with k \in \mathbb N and k \leq \frac{n}{2} if the dimension n is even. Each P_{2k} has leading order term (- \Delta)^k and is equal to  (- \Delta) ^k if the metric is flat.
