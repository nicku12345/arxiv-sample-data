We produce a new general family of flat tori in R^4, the first one since Bianchi's classical works in the 19th century. To construct these flat tori, obtained via small perturbation of certain Hopf tori in S^3, we first present a global description of all isometric immersions of R^2 into R^4 with flat normal bundle.
