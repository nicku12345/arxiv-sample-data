In this note we specialize and illustrate the ideas developed in the paper math.DG/0201112 of the first author ("Index theory, eta forms, and Deligne cohomology ") in the case of the determinant line bundle. We discuss the surgery formula in the adiabatic limit using the adiabatic decomposition formula of the zeta regularized determinant of the Dirac Laplacian obtained by the second author and K. Wojciechowski.
