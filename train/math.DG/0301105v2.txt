In this paper, we continue studying the 6-dimensional pseudo-Riemannian space V^6(g_{ij}) with signature [++--], which admits projective motions, i. e. continuous transformation groups preserving geodesics. In particular, we determine a necessary and sufficient condition that the 6-dimensional rigid h-spaces have constant curvature.
