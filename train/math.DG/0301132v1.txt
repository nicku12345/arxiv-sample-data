The main goal of this paper is to show a counterexample to the following conjecture:   {\bf Conjecture} [Meeks, Sullivan]: If f:M\to \mathbb{R}^3 is a complete proper minimal immersion where M is a Riemannian surface without boundary and with finite genus, then M is parabolic.   We have proved:   {\bf Theorem:} There exists \chi: D\longrightarrow \mathbb{R}^3, a conformal proper minimal immersion defined on the unit disk.
