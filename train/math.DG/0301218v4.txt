We consider some infinitesmal and global deformations of G_2 structures on 7-manifolds. We discover a canonical way to deform a G_2 structure by a vector field in which the associated metric gets "twisted" in some way by the vector cross product. We present a system of partial differential equations for an unknown vector field whose solution would yield a manifold with holonomy G_2. Similarly we consider analogous constructions for Spin(7) structures on 8-manifolds. Some of the results carry over directly, while others do not because of the increased non-linearity of the Spin(7) case.
