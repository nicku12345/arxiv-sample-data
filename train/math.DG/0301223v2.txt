Let  l : \Sigma \to X be a weakly Lagrangian map of a compact orientable surface  \Sigma in a K\"ahler surface  X which is area minimizing in its homotopy class of maps in  W^{1,2}(\Sigma, X), the Sobolev space of maps of square integrable first derivative. Schoen and Wolfson showed such  l is Lipschitz, and it is smooth except at most at finitely many points of Maslov index 1 or -1. In this note, we observe if in addition c_1(X)[l]=0,  l is smooth everywhere. Here  c_1(X) is the first Chern class of  X.
