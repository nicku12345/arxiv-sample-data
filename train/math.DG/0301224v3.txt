We shall investigate flat surfaces in hyperbolic 3-space with admissible singularities, called `flat fronts'. An Osserman-type inequality for complete flat fronts is shown. When equality holds in this inequality, we show that all the ends are embedded. Moreover, we shall give new examples for which equality holds.
