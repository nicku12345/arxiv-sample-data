We present an approach to solvable pseudo-Riemannian symmetric spaces based on papers of M.Cahen, M.Parker and N.Wallach. Thereby we reproduce the classification of solvable symmetric triples of Lorentzian signature (1,n-1) and complete the case of signature (2,n-2). Moreover we discuss the topology of non-simply-connected symmetric spaces.
