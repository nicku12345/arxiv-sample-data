We study almost Kaehler manifolds whose curvature tensor satisfies the third curvature condition of Gray. We show that the study of manifolds within this class reduces to the study of a subclass having the property that the torsion of the first canonical Hermitian connection has the simplest possible algebraic form. This allows to understand the structure of the Kaehler nullity of an almost Kaehler manifold with parallel torsion.
