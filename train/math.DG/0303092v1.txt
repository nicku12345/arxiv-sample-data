We show that any closed biquotient with finite fundamental group admits metrics of positive Ricci curvature. Also, let M be a closed manifold on which a compact Lie group G acts with cohomogeneity one, and let L be a closed subgroup of G which acts freely on M. We show that the quotient N := M/L carries metrics of nonnegative Ricci and almost nonnegative sectional curvature. Moreover, if N has finite fundamental group, then N admits also metrics of positive Ricci curvature. Particular examples include infinite families of simply connected manifolds with the rational cohomology rings and integral homology of complex and quaternionic projective spaces.
