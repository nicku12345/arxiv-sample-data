A torsion-free G_2 structure admitting an infinitesimal isometry is shown to give rise to a 4-manifold equipped with a complex symplectic structure and a 1-parameter family of functions and 2-forms linked by second order equations. Reversing the process in various special cases leads to the construction of explicit metrics with holonomy equal to G_2.
