There are several ways of a construction of a boundary of a symmetric space using pencils of geodesics: the Karpelevich boundary, the visibility boundary, the associahedral boundary, and the sea urchin. We give explicit descriptions of these boundaries. We obtain some moduli space like polyhedra as sections of these compactifications by Cartan subspaces. For simplicity, we consider only the space GL_n/O_n of ellipsoids in R^n.
