This preliminary report studies immersed surfaces of constant mean curvature in H^3 through their {\it adjusted Gauss maps} (as harmonic maps in S^2) and their {\it adjusted frames} in SU(2). Lawson's correspondence between Euclidean CMC surfaces and their hyperbolic cousins is interpreted here under a different perspective: the equivalence of their Weierstrass representations (normalized potentials). This work also presents a construction algorithm for the moving frame, the adjusted frame, their Maurer-Cartan forms, and ultimately the CMC immersion.
