The gluing formula of the zeta-determinant of a Laplacian given by Burghelea, Friedlander and Kappeler contains an unknown constant. In this paper we compute this constant to complete the formula under the assumption of the product structure near boundary. As applications of this result,we prove the adiabatic decomposition theorems of the zeta-determinant of a Laplacian with respect to the Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions and of the analytic torsion with respect to the absolute and relative boundary conditions.
