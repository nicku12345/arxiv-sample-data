In my talk I will discuss the following results which were obtained in joint work with Wilderich Tuschmann. 1. For any given numbers m, C and D, the class of m-dimensional simply connected closed smooth manifolds with finite second homotopy groups which admit a Riemannian metric with sectional curvature \vert K \vert\le C and diameter \le D contains only finitely many diffeomorphism types. 2. Given any m and any \delta>0, there exists a positive constant i_0=i_0(m,\delta)>0 such that the injectivity radius of any simply connected compact m-dimensional Riemannian manifold with finite second homotopy group and Ricci curvature Ric\ge\delta, K\le 1, is bounded from below by i_0(m,\delta). I also intend to discuss Riemannian megafolds, a generalized notion of Riemannian manifolds, and their use and usefulness in the proof of these results.
