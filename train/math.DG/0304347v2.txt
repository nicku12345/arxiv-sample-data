In this paper we first establish the relation between the zeta-determinant of a Dirac Laplacian with the Dirichlet boundary condition and the APS boundary condition on a cylinder. Using this result and the gluing formula of the zeta-determinant given by Burghelea, Friedlander and Kappeler with some assumptions, we prove the adiabatic decomposition theorem of the zeta-determinant of a Dirac Laplacian. This result was originally proved by J. Park and K. Wojciechowski in [11] but our method is completely different from the one they presented.
