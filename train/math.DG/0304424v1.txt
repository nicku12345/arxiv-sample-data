The pseudo-Riemannian manifold M=(M^{4n},g), n \geq 2 is para-quaternionic K\" ahler if hol(M) \subset sp(n, \RR) \oplus sp(1, \RR). If hol(M) \subset sp(n, \RR), than the manifold M is called para-hyperK\" ahler. The other possible definitions of these manifolds use certain parallel para-quaternionic structures in \End (TM), similarly to the quaternionic case. In order to relate these different definitions we study para-quaternionic algebras in details. We describe the reduction method for the para-quaternionic K\" ahler and para-hyperK\" ahler manifolds and give some examples. The decomposition of a curvature tensor of the para-quaternionic type is also described.
