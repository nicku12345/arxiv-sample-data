Let (M,g) be a compact Einstein manifold with smooth boundary. We consider the spectrum of the p form valued Laplacian with respect to a suitable boundary condition. We show that certain geometric properties of the boundary may be spectrally characterized in terms of this data where we fix the Einstein constant.
