We introduce a general notion of twistorial map and classify twistorial harmonic morphisms with one-dimensional fibres from self-dual four-manifolds. Such maps can be characterised as those which pull back Abelian monopoles to self-dual connections. In fact, the constructions involve solving a generalised monopole equation, and also the Beltrami fields equation of hydrodynamics, and lead to constructions of self-dual metrics.
