If the holonomy representation of an (n+2)--dimensional simply-connected Lorentzian manifold (M,h) admits a degenerate invariant subspace its holonomy group is contained in the parabolic group (\mathbb{R} \times SO(n))\ltimes \mathbb{R}^n. The main ingredient of such a holonomy group is the SO(n)--projection G:=pr_{SO(n)}(Hol_p(M,h)) and one may ask whether it has to be a Riemannian holonomy group. In this paper we show that this is the case if G\subset U(n/2) or if the irreducible acting components of G are simple.
