We prove that on a compact n-dimensional spin manifold admitting a non-trivial harmonic 1-form of constant length, every eigenvalue \lambda of the Dirac operator satisfies the inequality \lambda^2 \geq \frac{n-1}{4(n-2)}\inf_M Scal. In the limiting case the universal cover of the manifold is isometric to R\times N where N is a manifold admitting Killing spinors.
