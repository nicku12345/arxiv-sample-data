We introduce a new geometric structure on differentiable manifolds. A \textit{Contact} \textit{Pair}on a manifold M is a pair (\alpha,\eta)  of Pfaffian forms of constant classes 2k+1 and 2h+1 respectively such that \alpha\wedge d\alpha^{k}\wedge\eta\wedge d\eta^{h} is a volume form. Both forms have a characteristic foliation whose leaves are contact manifolds. These foliations are transverse and complementary. Further differential objects are associated to Contact Pairs: two commuting Reeb vector fields, Legendrian curves on M and two Lie brackets on \mathcal{C}^{\infty}(M) . We give a local model and several existence theorems on nilpotent Lie groups, nilmanifolds, bundles over the circle and principal torus bundles.
