The Einstein equations (EE) are certain conditions on the Riemann tensor on the real Minkowski space M. In the twistor picture, after complexification and compactification M becomes the Grassmannian Gr_{2}^{4} of 2-dimensional subspaces in the 4-dimensional complex one. Here we answer for which of the classical domains considered as manifolds with G-structure it is possible to impose conditions similar in some sense to EE. The above investigation has its counterpart on superdomains: an analog of the Riemann tensor is defined for any supermanifold with G-structure with any Lie supergroup G. We also derive similar analogues of EE on supermanifolds. Our analogs of EE are not what physicists consider as SUGRA (supergravity), for SUGRA see \cite{GL4,LP2}.
