We proved the convergence of a sequence of 2 dimensional comapct Kahler-Einstein orbifolds with rational quotient singularities and with some uniform bounds on the volumes and on the Euler characteristics of our orbifods to a Kahler-Einstein 2-dimensional orbifold. Our limit orbifold can have worse singularities than the orbifolds in our sequence. We will also derive some estimates on the norms of the sections of plurianticanonical bundles of our orbifolds in the sequence that we are considering and our limit orbifold.
