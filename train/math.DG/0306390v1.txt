We describe the relationship between complex-valued harmonic morphisms from Minkowski 4-space} and the shear-free ray congruences of mathematical physics. Then we show how a horizontally conformal submersion on a domain of Euclidean 3-space gives the boundary values at infinity of a complex-valued harmonic morphism on hyperbolic 4-space.
