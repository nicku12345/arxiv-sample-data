Given a compact n-dimensional immersed Riemannian manifold M^n in some Euclidean space we prove that if the Hausdorff dimension of the singular set of the Gauss map is small, then M^n is homeomorphic to the sphere S^n.   Also, we define a concept of finite geometrical type and prove that finite geometrical type hypersurfaces with small set of points of zero Gauss-Kronecker curvature are topologically the sphere minus a finite number of points. A characterization of the 2n-catenoid is obtained.
