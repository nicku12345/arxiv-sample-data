We prove a number of results relating various measures (volume, Legendrian index, stability index, and spectral curve genus) of the geometric complexity of special Lagrangian T^2-cones. We explain how these results fit into a program to understand the "most common" three-dimensional isolated singularities of special Lagrangian submanifolds in almost Calabi-Yau manifolds.
