We study the problem of existence of regions separating a given amount of volume with the least possible perimeter inside a Euclidean cone. Our main result shows that nonexistence for a given volume implies that the isoperimetric profile of the cone coincides with the one of the half-space. This allows us to give some criteria ensuring existence of isoperimetric regions: for instance, local convexity of the cone at some boundary point.   We also characterize which are the stable regions in a convex cone, i.e., second order minima of perimeter under a volume constraint. From this it follows that the isoperimetric regions in a convex cone are the euclidean balls centered at the vertex intersected with the cone.
