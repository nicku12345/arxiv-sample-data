In order to understand the structure of the cohomologies involved in the study of projectively equivariant quantizations, we introduce a notion of affine representation of a Lie algebra.We show how it is related to linear representations and 1-cohomology classes of the algebra. We classify the affine representations of the Lie algebra of vector fields of a smooth manifold associated to its action on symmetric tensor fields of type (1,2). Among them, we recover the space of symmetric affine linear connections and that of projective structures of the manifold. We compute some of the associated cohomologies.
