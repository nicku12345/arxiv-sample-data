Due to a result by Mackenzie, extensions of transitive Lie groupoids are equivalent to certain Lie groupoids which admit an action of a Lie group. This paper is a treatment of the equivariant connection theory and holonomy of such groupoids, and shows that such connections give rise to the transition data necessary for the classification of their respective Lie algebroids.
