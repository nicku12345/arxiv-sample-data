Benedetti and Guadagnini have conjectured that the marked lenght spectrum of the constant mean curvature foliation M_\tau in a 2+1 dimensional flat spacetime V with compact hyperbolic Cauchy surfaces converges, in the direction of the singularity, to that of the marked measure spectrum of the R-tree dual to the measured foliation corresponding to the translational part of the holonomy of V. We prove that this is the case for n+1 dimensional, n \geq 2, {\em simplicial} flat spacetimes with compact hyperbolic Cauchy surface. A simplicial spacetime is obtained from the Lorentz cone over a hyperbolic manifold by deformations corresponding to a simple measured foliation.
