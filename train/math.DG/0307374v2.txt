We present a universal construction of almost duality for Frobenius manifolds. The analytic setup of this construction is described in details for the case of semisimple Frobenius manifolds. We illustrate the general considerations by examples from the singularity theory, mirror symmetry, the theory of Coxeter groups and Shephard groups, from the Seiberg - Witten duality.
