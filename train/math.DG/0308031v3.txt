We show that for every non-negative integer n there is a real n-dimensional family of minimal Lagrangian tori in CP^2, and hence of special Lagrangian cones in C^3 whose link is a torus. The proof utilises the fact that such tori arise from integrable systems, and can be described using algebro-geometric (spectral curve) data.
