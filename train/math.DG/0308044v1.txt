Let \Gamma be a nondegenerate geodesic in a compact Riemannian manifold M. We prove the existence of a partial foliation of a neighbourhood of \Gamma by CMC surfaces which are small perturbations of the geodesic tubes about \Gamma. There are gaps in this foliation, which correspond to a bifurcation phenomenon. Conversely, we also prove, under certain restrictions, that the existence of a partial CMC foliation of this type about a submanifold \Gamma of any dimension implies that \Gamma is minimal.
