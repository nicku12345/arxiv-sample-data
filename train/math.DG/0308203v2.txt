We show that the minimal hypersurface method of Schoen and Yau can be used for the ``quantitative'' study of positive scalar curvature. More precisely, we show that if a manifold admits a metric g with s_g \ge | T | or s_g \ge | W |, where s_g is the scalar curvature of of g, T any 2-tensor on M and W the Weyl tensor of g, then any closed orientable stable minimal (totally geodesic in the second case) hypersurface also admits a metric with the corresponding positivity of scalar curvature. A corollary about the topology of such hypersurfaces is proved in a special situation.
