We obtain a locally symmetric Kaehler Einstein structure on the cotangent bundle of a Riemannian manifold of negative constant sectional curvature. Similar results are obtained on a tube around zero section in the cotangent bundle, in the case of a Riemannian manifold of positive constant sectional curvature. The obtained Kaehler Einstein structures cannot have constant holomorphic sectional curvature.
