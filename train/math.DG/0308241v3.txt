An odd-dimensional version of the Goldberg conjecture was formulated and proved by Boyer and Galicki, using an orbifold analogue of Sekigawa's formulas, and an approximation argument of K-contact structures with quasi-regular ones. We provide here another proof of this result and give some applications.
