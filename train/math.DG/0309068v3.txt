We give two generalizations of the Atiyah-Bott-Berline-Vergne localization theorem for the equivariant cohomology of a torus action: 1) replacing the torus action by a compact connected Lie group action, 2) replacing the manifold having a torus action by an equivariant map. This provides a systematic method for calculating the Gysin homomorphism in ordinary cohomology of an equivariant map. As an example, we recover a formula of Akyildiz-Carrell for the Gysin homomorphism of flag manifolds.
