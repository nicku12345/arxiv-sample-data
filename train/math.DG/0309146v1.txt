In this work we deal with left invariant complex and symplectic structures on simply connected four dimensional solvable real Lie groups. We search the general form of such structures, when they exist and we make use of this information to determine all left invariant Kaehler structures. Finally, as an appendix we compute explicitly the real cohomology of the corresponding Lie algebras.
