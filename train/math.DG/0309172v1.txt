We classify quadruples (M,g,m,\tau) in which (M,g) is a compact K\"ahler manifold of complex dimension m>2 with a nonconstant function \tau on M such that the conformally related metric g/\tau^2, defined wherever \tau\ne 0, is Einstein. It turns out that M then is the total space of a holomorphic CP^1 bundle over a compact K\"ahler-Einstein manifold (N,h). The quadruples in question constitute four disjoint families: one, well-known, with K\"ahler metrics g that are locally reducible; a second, discovered by B\'erard Bergery (1982), and having \tau\ne 0 everywhere; a third one, related to the second by a form of analytic continuation, and analogous to some known K\"ahler surface metrics; and a fourth family, present only in odd complex dimensions m\ge 9. Our classification uses a {\it moduli curve}, which is a subset \mathcal{C}, depending on m, of an algebraic curve in R^2. A point (u,v) in \mathcal{C} is naturally associated with any (M,g,m,\tau) having all of the above properties except for compactness of M, replaced by a weaker requirement of ``vertical'' compactness. One may in turn reconstruct M,g and \tau from this (u,v) coupled with some other data, among them a K\"ahler-Einstein base (N,h) for the CP^1 bundle M. The points (u,v) arising in this way from (M,g,m,\tau) with compact M form a countably infinite subset of \mathcal{C}.
