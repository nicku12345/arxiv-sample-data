H-minimal Lagrangian submanifolds in general K\"{a}hler manifolds generalize special Lagrangian submanifolds in Calabi-Yau manifolds. In this paper we will use the deformation theory of H-minimal Lagrangian submanifolds in K\"{a}hler manifolds to construct minimal Lagrangian torus in certain K\"{a}hler-Einstein manifolds with negative first Chern class.
