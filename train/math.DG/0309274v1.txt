The holonomy group of an (n+2)-dimensional simply-connected, indecomposable but non-irreducible Lorentzian manifold (M,h) is contained in the parabolic group (\mathbb{R} \times SO(n))\ltimes \mathbb{R}^n. The main ingredient of such a holonomy group is the SO(n)--projection G:=pr_{SO(n)}(Hol_p(M,h)) and one may ask whether it has to be a Riemannian holonomy group. In this paper we show that this is always the case, completing our results of the first part math.DG/0305139. We draw consequences for the existence of parallel spinors on Lorentzian manifolds.
