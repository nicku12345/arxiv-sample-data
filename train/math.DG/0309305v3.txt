We review the construction known as the Nahm transform in a generalized context, which includes all the examples of this construction already described in the literature. The Nahm transform for translation invariant instantons on \real^4 is presented in an uniform manner. We also analyze two new examples, the first of which being the first example involving a four-manifold that is not complex.
