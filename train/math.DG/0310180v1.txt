The main goal is to classify 4-dimensional real Lie algebras \g which admit a para-hypercomplex structure. This is a step toward the classification of Lie groups admitting the corresponding left-invariant structure and therefore possessing a neutral, left-invariant, anti-self-dual metric. Our study is related to the work of Barberis who classified real, 4-dimensional simply-connected Lie groups which admit an invariant hypercomplex structure.
