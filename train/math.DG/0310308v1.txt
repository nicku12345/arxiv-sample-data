For a finite dimensional Lie algebra \g of vector fields on a manifold M we show that M can be completed to a G-space in a unversal way, which however is neither Hausdorff nor T_1 in general. Here G is a connected Lie group with Lie-algebra \g. For a transitive \g-action the completion is of the form G/H for a Lie subgroup H which need not be closed. In general the completion can be constructed by completing each \g-orbit.
