A rigidity result for weakly asymptotically hyperbolic manifolds with lower bounds on Ricci curvature is proved without assuming that the manifolds are spin. The argument makes use of a quasi-local mass characterization of Euclidean balls from \cite{Miao} \cite{S_T} and eigenfunction compactification ideas from \cite{Qing}.
