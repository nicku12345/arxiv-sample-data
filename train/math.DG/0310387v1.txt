For a Riemannian manifold M^n with the curvature tensor R, the Jacobi operator R_X is defined by R_XY = R(X,Y)X. The manifold M^n is called {\it pointwise Osserman} if, for every p \in M^n, the eigenvalues of the Jacobi operator R_X do not depend of a unit vector X \in T_pM^n, and is called {\it globally Osserman} if they do not depend of the point p either. R. Osserman conjectured that globally Osserman manifolds are flat or rank-one symmetric. This Conjecture is true for manifolds of dimension n \ne 8, 16. Here we prove the Osserman Conjecture and its pointwise version for 8-dimensional manifolds.
