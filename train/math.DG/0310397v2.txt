We derive necessary conditions on the parameters of the ends of a CMC-1 trinoid in hyperbolic 3-space H^{3} with symmetry plane by passing to its conjugate minimal surface. Together with Daniel's results, this yields a classification of generic symmetric trinoids. We also discuss the relation to other classification results of trinoids by Bobenko et al. and Umehara-Yamada.   To obtain the result above, we show that the conjugate minimal surface of a catenoidal CMC-1 end in H^{3} with symmetry plane is asymptotic to a suitable helicoid.
