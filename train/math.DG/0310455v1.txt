The second order tangent bundle T^{2}M of a smooth manifold M consists of the equivalent classes of curves on M that agree up to their acceleration. It is known that in the case of a finite n-dimensional manifold M, T^{2}M becomes a vector bundle over M if and only if M is endowed with a linear connection. Here we extend this result to M modeled on an arbitrarily chosen Banach space and more generally to those Fr\'{e}chet manifolds which can be obtained as projective limits of Banach manifolds. The result may have application in the study of infinite-dimensional dynamical systems.
