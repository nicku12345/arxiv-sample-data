A study is made of real Lie algebras admitting a hypersymplectic structure, and we provide a method to construct such hypersymplectic Lie algebras. We use this method in order to obtain the classification of all hypersymplectic structures on four-dimensional Lie algebras, and we describe the associated metrics on the corresponding Lie groups.
