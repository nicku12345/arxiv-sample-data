In this paper we show that the convergence of complete Kahler-Einstein hypersurfaces in complex torus in the sense of Cheeger-Gromov will canonically degenerate the underlying manifolds into "pair of pants" decomposition. We also construct minimal Lagrangian tori that represent the vanishing cycles of the degeneration.
