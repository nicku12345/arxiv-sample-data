We establish a canonical gluing procedure for Seiberg-Witten monopoles on the two pieces of a closed, oriented 4-manifold X which is split along a 3-dimensional closed, oriented submanifold. We only assume that the (unperturbed) character variety is Kuranishi-smooth and the limiting maps are transversal -- then we will be able to glue regular monopoles over the irreducible points of the character variety.
