We show that a complete embedded maximal surface in the 3-dimensional Lorentz-Minkowski space L^3 with a finite number of singularities is, up to a Lorentzian isometry, an entire graph over any spacelike plane asymptotic to a vertical half catenoid or a horizontal plane and with conelike singular points.   We study the space G_n of entire maximal graphs over \{x_3=0\} in L^3 with n+1 \geq 2 conelike singularities and vertical limit normal vector at infinity. We show that G_n is a real analytic manifold of dimension 3n+4, and the coordinates are given by the position of the singular points in R^3 and the logarithmic growth at the end. We also introduce the moduli space M_n of {\em marked} graphs with n+1 singular points (a mark in a graph is an ordering of its singularities), which is a (n+1)-sheeted covering of G_n. We prove that identifying marked graphs differing by translations, rotations about a vertical axis, homotheties or symmetries about a horizontal plane, the corresponding quotient space M_n is an analytic manifold of dimension 3n-1.
