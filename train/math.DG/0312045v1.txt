Given two hyperk\"ahler manifolds M and N and a quaternionic instanton on their product, a hyperk\"ahler Nahm transform can be defined, which maps quaternionic instantons on M to quaternionic instantons on N. This construction includes the case of Nahm transform for periodic instantons on \bR^4, the Fourier-Mukai transform for instantons on K3 surfaces, as well as the Nahm transform for ALE instantons.
