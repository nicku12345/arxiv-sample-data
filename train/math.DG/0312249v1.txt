We study the spectral geometry of the Riemann curvature tensor for Pseudo-Riemannian manifolds and provide some examples illustrating the phenomena which can arise in the higher signature setting.   Dedication: This paper is dedicated to the memory of our colleague Prof.G. Tsagas who studied the spectral geometry of Laplacian.
