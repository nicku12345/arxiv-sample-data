We study the filling invariants at infinity div_{k} for Hadamard manifolds defined by Brady and Farb in [Filling-invariants at infinity for manifolds of nonpositive curvature]. Among other results, we give a positive answer to the question they posed: whether these invariants can be used to detect the rank of a symmetric space of noncompact type.
