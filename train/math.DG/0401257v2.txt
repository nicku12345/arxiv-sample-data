Periods of parallel exterior forms define natural coordinates on the deformation space of complete affine structures on the two-torus. These coordinates define a differentiable structure on this deformation space, under which it is diffeomorphic to R^2. The action of the mapping class group of T^2 is equivalent in these coordinates with the standard linear action of \SL_2(Z) on R^2.
