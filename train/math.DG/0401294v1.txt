In this paper we give a procedure to construct hypersymplectic structures on R^{4n} beginning with affine-symplectic data on R^{2n}. These structures are shown to be invariant by a 3-step nilpotent double Lie group and the resulting metrics are complete and not necessarily flat. Explicit examples of this construction are exhibited.
