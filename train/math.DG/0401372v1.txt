We study Lagrangian submanifolds foliated by (n-1)-spheres in R^2n for n>2. We give a parametrization valid for such submanifolds, and refine that description when the submanifold is special Lagrangian, self-similar or Hamiltonian stationary. In all these cases, the submanifold is centered, i.e. invariant under the action of SO(n). It suffices then to solve a simple ODE in two variables to describe the geometry of the solutions.
