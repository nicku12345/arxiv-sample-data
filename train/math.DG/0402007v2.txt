The equivalence of principal bundles with transitive Lie groupoids due to Ehresmann is a well known result. A remarkable generalisation of this equivalence, due to Mackenzie, is the equivalence of principal bundle extensions with those transitive Lie groupoids over the total space of a principal bundle, which also admit an action of the structure group by automorphisms. This paper proves the existence of suitably equivariant transition functions for such groupoids, generalising consequently the classification of principal bundles by means of their transition functions, to extensions of principal bundles by an equivariant form of \v{C}ech cohomology.
