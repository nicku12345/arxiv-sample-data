This paper generalizes a rigidity result of complex hyperbolic spaces by M. Herzlich. We prove that an almost Hermitian spin manifold (M,g) of real dimension 4n+2 which is strongly asymptotic to \hyp{\C}^{2n+1} and satisfies a certain scalar curvature bound must be isometric to the complex hyperbolic space. The fact that we do not assume g to be K\"ahler reflects in the inequality for the scalar curvature.
