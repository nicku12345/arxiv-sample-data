We construct a infinite-dimensional manifold structure adapted to analytic Lie pseudogroups of infinite type. More precisely, we prove that any isotropy subgroup of an analytic Lie pseudogroup of infinite type is a regular infinite-dimensional Lie group, modelled on a locally convex strict inductive limit of Banach spaces. This is an infinite-dimensional generalization to the case of Lie pseudogroups of the classical second fundamental theorem of Lie.
