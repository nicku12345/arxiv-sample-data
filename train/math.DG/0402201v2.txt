Let SO(n) act in the standard way on C^n and extend this action in the usual way to C^{n+1}.   It is shown that a nonsingular special Lagrangian submanifold L in C^{n+1} that is invariant under this SO(n)-action intersects the fixed line C in a nonsingular real-analytic arc A (that may be empty). If n>2, then A has no compact component.   Conversely, an embedded, noncompact nonsingular real-analytic arc A in C lies in an embedded nonsingular special Lagrangian submanifold that is SO(n)-invariant. The same existence result holds for compact A if n=2. If A is connected, there exist n distinct nonsingular SO(n)-invariant special Lagrangian extensions of A such that any embedded nonsingular SO(n)-invariant special Lagrangian extension of A agrees with one of these n extensions in some open neighborhood of A.   The method employed is an analysis of a singular nonlinear PDE and ultimately calls on the work of Gerard and Tahara to prove the existence of the extension.
