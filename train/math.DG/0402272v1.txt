Let M be an isoparametric hypersurface in the sphere S^n with four distinct principal curvatures. M\"{u}nzner showed that the four principal curvatures can have at most two distinct multiplicities m_1, m_2, and Stolz showed that the pair (m_1,m_2) must either be (2,2), (4,5), or be equal to the multiplicities of an isoparametric hypersurface of FKM-type, constructed by Ferus, Karcher and M\"{u}nzner from orthogonal representations of Clifford algebras. In this paper, we prove that if the multiplicities satisfy m_2 \geq 3m_1 - 1, then the isoparametric hypersurface M must be of FKM-type. Together with known results of Takagi for the case m_1 = 1, and Ozeki and Takeuchi for m_1 = 2, this handles all possible pairs of multiplicities except for 10 cases, for which the classification problem remains open. The paper improves the result of a pre-existing preprint with the same title, in which 14 cases remained open.
