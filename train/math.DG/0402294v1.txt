The volume of a k-dimensional foliation \mathcal{F} in a Riemannian manifold M^{n} is defined as the mass of image of the Gauss map, which is a map from M to the Grassmann bundle of k-planes in the tangent bundle. Generalizing a construction by Gluck and Ziller, "singular" foliations by 3-spheres are constructed on round spheres S^{4n+3}, as well as a singular foliation by 7-spheres on S^{15}, which minimize volume within their respective relative homology classes. These singular examples provide lower bounds for volumes of regular 3-dimensional foliations of S^{4n+3} and regular 7-dimensional foliations of S^{15} .
