Let the Ricci curvature of a compact Riemannian manifold be greater, at every point, than the Lie derivative of the metric with respect to some fixed smooth vector field. It is shown that the fundamental group then has only finitely many conjugacy classes. This applies, in particular, to all compact shrinking Ricci solitons.
