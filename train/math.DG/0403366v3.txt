We present a theorem on the unitarizability of loop group valued monodromy representations and apply this to show the existence of new families of constant mean curvature surfaces homeomorphic to a thrice-punctured sphere in the simply-connected 3-dimensional space forms \R^3, \bbS^3  and \bbH^3. Additionally, we compute the extended frame for any associated family of Delaunay surfaces.
