We introduce a natural extension of the metric tensor and the Hodge star operator to the algebra of double forms to study some aspects of the structure of this algebra. These properties are then used to study new Riemannian curvature invariants, called the (p,q)-curvatures. They are a generalization of the p-curvature obtained by substituting the Gauss-Kronecker tensor to the Riemann curvature tensor. In particular, for p=0, the (0,q)-curvatures coincide with the H. Weyl curvature invariants, for p=1 the (1,q)-curvatures are the curvatures of generalized Einstein tensors and for q=1 the (p,1)-curvatures coincide with the p-curvatures. Also, we prove that for an Einstein manifold of dimension n\geq 4 the second H. Weyl curvature invariant is nonegative, and that it is nonpositive for a conformally flat manifold with zero scalar curvature. A similar result is proved for the higher H. Weyl curvature invariants.
