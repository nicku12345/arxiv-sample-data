Let M be an oriented closed 4-manifold and \cL be a spin^c structure on M. In this paper we prove that under a suitable condition the Seiberg-Witten moduli space has a canonical spin structure and its spin bordism class is an invariant for M. We show that the invariant for M=#_{j=1}^l M_j is not zero, where each M_j is a K3 surface or a product of two oriented closed surfaces with odd genus and l is 2 or 3. As a corollary, we obtain the adjunction inequality for M. Moreover we show that M # N does not admit Einstein metric for some N with b^+(N)=0.
