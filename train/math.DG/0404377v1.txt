We provide necessary and sufficient conditions on the derived type of a vector field distribution \Cal V in order that it be locally equivalent to a partial prolongation of the contact distribution \Cal C^{(1)}_q, on the first order jet bundle of maps from \Bbb R to \Bbb R^q, q\geq 1. This result fully generalises the classical Goursat normal form. Our proof is constructive: it is proven that if \Cal V is locally equivalent to a partial prolongation of \Cal C^{(1)}_q then the explicit construction of contact coordinates algorithmically depends upon the integration of a sequence of geometrically defined and algorithmically determined integrable Pfaffian systems on the ambient manifold.
