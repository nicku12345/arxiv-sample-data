Weakly-irreducible not irreducible subalgebras of \so(1,n+1) were classified by L. Berard Bergery and A. Ikemakhen. In the present paper a geometrical proof of this result is given. Transitively acting isometry groups of Lobachevskian spaces and transitively acting similarity transformation groups of Euclidean spaces are classified.
