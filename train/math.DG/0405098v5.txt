The problem of classification of connected holonomy groups (equivalently of holonomy algebras) for pseudo-Riemannian manifolds is open. The classification of Riemannian holonomy algebras is a classical result. The classification of Lorentzian holonomy algebras was obtained recently.   In the present paper weakly-irreducible not irreducible subalgebras of \su(1,n+1) (n\geq 0) are classified. Weakly-irreducible not irreducible holonomy algebras of pseudo-K\"ahlerian and special pseudo-K\"ahlerian manifolds are classified. An example of metric for each possible holonomy algebra is given. This gives the classification of holonomy algebras for pseudo-K\"ahlerian manifolds of index 2
