We introduce a local coordinate description for the correspondence between the space of oriented affine lines in Euclidean {\Bbb{R}}^3 and the tangent bundle to the 2-sphere. These can be utilised to give canonical coordinates on surfaces in {\Bbb{R}}^3, as we illustrate with a number of explicit examples.
