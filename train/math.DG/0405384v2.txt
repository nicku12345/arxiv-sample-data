We study geometric first order differential operators on quaternionic K\"ahler manifolds. Their principal symbols are related to the enveloping algebra and Casimir elements for \Sp(1)\Sp(n). This observation leads to anti-symmetry of the principal symbols and Bochner-Weitzenb\"ock formulas for operators. As an application, we estimate the first eigenvalues of them.
