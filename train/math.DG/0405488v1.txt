The reduction theorems for general linear and classical connections are generalized for operators with values in higher order gauge-natural bundles. We prove that natural operators depending on the s_1-jets of classical connections, on the s_2-jets of general linear connections and on the r-jets of tensor fields with values in gauge-natural bundles of order k\ge 1, s_1+2\ge s_2, s_1,s_2\ge r-1\ge k-2, can be factorized through the (k-2)-jets of both connections, the (k-1)-jets of the tensor fields and sufficiently high covariant differentials of the curvature tensors and the tensor fields.
