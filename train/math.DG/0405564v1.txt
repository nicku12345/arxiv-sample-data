Given any nondegenerate k-dimensional minimal submanifold K of codimension greater than 1, we prove the existence of families of constant mean curvature submanifolds, with mean curvature varying from one member of the family to another, which `condense' to K. In particular, our result proves the existence of constant mean curvature hypersurfaces with nontrivial topology in any Riemannian manifold.
