In this paper we describe a new deformation that connects minimal disks with planar ends with minimal disks with helicoidal ends. In this way, we are able to construct a family of complete minimal surfaces with helicoidal ends that contains the singly periodic genus one helicoid of Hoffman, Karcher and Wei.
