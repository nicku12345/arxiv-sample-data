The exceptional holonomy groups are G2 in 7 dimensions, and Spin(7) in 8 dimensions. Riemannian manifolds with these holonomy groups are Ricci-flat. This is a survey paper on exceptional holonomy, in two parts.   Part I introduces the exceptional holonomy groups, and explains constructions for compact 7- and 8-manifolds with holonomy G2 and Spin(7). The simplest such constructions work by using techniques from complex geometry and Calabi-Yau analysis to resolve the singularities of a torus orbifold T^7/G or T^8/G, for G a finite group preserving a flat G2 or Spin(7)-structure on T^7 or T^8. There are also more complicated constructions which begin with a Calabi-Yau manifold or orbifold.   Part II discusses the calibrated submanifolds of G2 and Spin(7)-manifolds: associative 3-folds and coassociative 4-folds for G2, and Cayley 4-folds for Spin(7). We explain the general theory, following Harvey and Lawson, and the known examples. Finally we describe the deformation theory of compact calibrated submanifolds, following McLean.
