Let (M,w,L) be a symplectic manifold endowed with a lagrangian foliation L. Liberman and Weinstein have shown that the leaves of L are endowed with an affine structure. In this paper we provide links between the theories of affine manifolds and symplectic geometry. Using the work of Donaldson who have shown the existence of symplectic submanifolds in every codimension, we show the Auslander conjecture to be true if the linear holonomy is contained in   Gl(n,Z)
