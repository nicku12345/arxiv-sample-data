The correspondence between 2-parameter families of oriented lines in {\Bbb{R}}^3 and surfaces in T{\Bbb{P}}^1 is studied, and the geometric properties of the lines are related to the complex geometry of the surface. Congruences generated by global sections of T{\Bbb{P}}^1 are investigated and a number of theorems are proven that generalise results for closed convex surfaces in {\Bbb{R}}^3.
