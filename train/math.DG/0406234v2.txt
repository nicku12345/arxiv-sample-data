Let \CV be a vector field distribution on manifold M. We give an efficient algorithm for the construction of local coordinates on M such that \CV may be locally expressed as some partial prolongation of the contact distribution \Cal C^{(1)}_q, on the first order jet bundle of maps from \Bbb R to \Bbb R^q, q\geq 1. It is proven that if \CV is locally equivalent to a partial prolongation of \Cal C^{(1)}_q then the explicit construction of contact coordinates algorithmically depends upon the determination of certain first integrals in a sequence of geometrically defined and algorithmically determined integrable Pfaffian systems on M. The number of these first integrals that must be computed satisfies a natural minimality criterion. These results therefore provide a full and constructive generalisation of the classical Goursat normal form from the theory of exterior differential systems.
