We introduce in this paper normal twistor equations for differential forms and study their solutions, the so-called normal conformal Killing forms. The twistor equations arise naturally from the canonical normal Cartan connection of conformal geometry. Reductions of its holonomy are related to solutions of the normal twistor equations. The case of decomposable normal conformal holonomy representations is discussed. A typical example with an irreducible holonomy representation are the so-called Fefferman spaces. We also apply our results to describe the geometry of solutions with conformal Killing spinors on Lorentzian spin manifolds.
