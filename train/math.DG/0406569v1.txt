We show that a subspace S of the space of real analytical functions on a manifold that satisfies certain regularity properties is contained in the set of solutions of a linear elliptic differential equation. The regularity properties are that S is closed in L^2(M) and that if a sequence of functions f_n in S converges in L^2(M), then so do the partial derivatives of the functions f_n.
