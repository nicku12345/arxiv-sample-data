We study tangential families, i.e. systems of rays emanating tangentially from given curves. We classify, up to Left-Right equivalence, stable singularities of tangential family germs (under deformations among tangential families) and we study their envelopes. We discuss applications of our results to the case of tangent geodesics of a curve.
