In this paper, we prove that, for any integer n\ge 2, there exists an \epsilon_{n} \ge 0 so that if M is an n-dimensional complete manifold with sectional curvature  K_{M}\ge 1 and if M has conjugate radius bigger than \frac{\pi}{2}  and contains a geodesic loop of length 2(\pi -\epsilon_{n}), then M is diffeomorphic to the Euclidian unit sphere S^{n}.
