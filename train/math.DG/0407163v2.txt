We obtain a topological interpretation for the space of L^2 harmonic forms for some complete Riemannian manifold : when the geometry at infinity is the geometry of a simply connected nilpotent Lie group, when the geometry at infinity is a symmetric space with non positive curvature and also when the geometry at infinity is parabolic.
