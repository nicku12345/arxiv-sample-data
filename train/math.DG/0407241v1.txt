We obtain a class of locally symmetric Kaehler Einstein structures on the cotangent bundle of a Riemannian manifold of negative sectional curvature. Similar results are obtained in the case of a Riemannian manifold of positive sectional curvature. The obtained class of Kaehler Einstein structures depends on one essential parameter and cannot have constant holomorphic sectional curvature.
