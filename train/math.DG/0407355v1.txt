We obtain a class of locally symetric Kaehler Einstein structures on the nonzero cotangent bundle of a Riemannian manifold of positive constant sectional curvature. The obtained class of Kaehler Einstein structures depends on one essential parameter and cannot have constant holomorphic sectional curvature.
