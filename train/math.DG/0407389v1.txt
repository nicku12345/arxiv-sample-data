We provide a local classification of isometric immersions f\colon L^p\times_\rho M^n\to\Q_c^{p+n+k} in codimensions k=1, 2 of warped products of Riemannian manifolds into space forms, under the assumptions that n\geq k+1 and that N^{p+n}=L^p\times_\rho M^n has no points with the same constant sectional curvature c as the ambient space form.
