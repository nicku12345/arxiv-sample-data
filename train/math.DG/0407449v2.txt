Applying a well known result for attracting fixed points of biholomorphisms \cite{RR, V}, we observe that one immediately obtains the following result: if (M^n,g) is a complete non-compact gradient K\"ahler-Ricci soliton which is either steady with positive Ricci curvature so that the scalar curvature attains its maximum at some point, or expanding with non-negative Ricci curvature, then M is biholomorphic to \ce ^n.
