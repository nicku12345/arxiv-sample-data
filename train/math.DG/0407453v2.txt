Some observations about the local and global generality of gradient Kahler Ricci solitons are made, including the existence of a canonically associated holomorphic volume form and vector field, the local generality of solutions with a prescribed holomorphic volume form and vector field, and the existence of Poincare coordinates in the case that the Ricci curvature is positive and the vector field has a fixed point.
