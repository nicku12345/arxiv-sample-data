The theory of surfaces in Euclidean space can be naturally formulated in the more general context of Legendre surfaces into the space of contact elements. We address the question of deformability of Legendre surfaces with respect to the symmetry group of Lie sphere contact transformations from the point of view of the deformation theory of submanifolds in homogeneous spaces. Necessary and sufficient conditions are provided for a Legendre surface to admit non-trivial deformations and the corresponding existence problem is discussed.
