In this paper, we consider new components of the key space of the Moduli space of minimal surfaces in flat 4-tori and calculate their dimensions. Moreover, we construct an example of minimal surfaces in 4-tori and obtain an element of the Moduli. In the process of the construction, we give an example of minimal surfaces with good property in a 3-torus distinct from classical examples.
