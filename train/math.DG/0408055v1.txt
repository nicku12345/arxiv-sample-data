We obtain a class of Kaehler Einstein structures on the nonzero cotangent bundle of a Riemannian manifold of positive constant sectional curvature. The obtained class of Kaehler Einstein structure depends on one essential parameter, cannot have constant holomorphic sectional curvature and is not locally symmetric.
