We show that an almost Hermitian manifold (M,g) of real dimension 4n which is strongly asymptotic to \mathbb{C}H^{2n} and satisfies a certain scalar curvature bound must be isometric to the complex hyperbolic space. Assuming K\"ahler instead of almost Hermitian this gives the already known rigidity result by H. Boualem and M. Herlich proved in \emph{Ann. Scuola Norm. Sup Pisa (Ser. V)}, vol. 1(2).
