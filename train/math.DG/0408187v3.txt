We determine several necessary and sufficient conditions for a closed almost-complex orbifold Q with cyclic local groups to admit a nonvanishing vector field. These conditions are stated separately in terms of the orbifold Euler-Satake characteristics of Q and its sectors, the Euler characteristics of the underlying topological spaces of Q and its sectors, and in terms of the orbifold Euler class e_{orb}(Q) in Chen-Ruan orbifold cohomology H_{orb}^\ast (Q; \R).
