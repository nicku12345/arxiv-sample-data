Our main results are: (1) The complex a Lagrangian points of a non-complex Lagrangian 2n-dimensional submanifold F:M\ra N, immersed with parallel mean curvature and with equal Kaehler angles into a Kaehler-Einstein manifold (N,J,g) of complex dimension 2n, are zeros of finite order of \sin^2\theta and \cos^2\theta respectively, where \theta is the common J-Kaelher angle. (2) If M is a Cayley submanifold of a Calabi-Yau (CY) manifold N of complex dimension 4, then \bigwedge^2_+NM is naturally isomorphic to \bigwedge^2_+TM. (3) If N is Ricci-flat (not necessarily CY) and M is a Cayley submanifold, then  p_1(\bigwedge^2_+NM)= p_1(\bigwedge^2_+TM) still holds, but p_1(\bigwedge^2_-NM)- p_1(\bigwedge^2_-TM) may describe a residue on the J-complex points, in the sense of Harvey and Lawson. We describe this residue by a PDE on a natural morphism \Phi:TM \to NM, \Phi(X)=(JX)^{\bot}, with singularities at the complex points. We give an explicit formula of this residue in a particular case. When (N,I,J,K,g) is an hyper-Kaehler manifold and M is an I-complex closed 4-submanifold, the first Weyl curvature invariant of M may be described as a residue on the J-Kaehler angle at the J_Lagrangian points by a Lelong-Poincar\'{e} type formula. We study the almost complex structure \Jw on M induced by F.
