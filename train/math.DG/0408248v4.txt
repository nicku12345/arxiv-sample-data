In this paper, we prove the existence of energy minimizers in each free homotopy class of maps between polyhedra with target space without focal points. Our proof involves a careful study of some geometric properties of riemannian polhyedra without focal points. Among other things, we show that on the relevant polyhedra, there exists a convex supporting function.
