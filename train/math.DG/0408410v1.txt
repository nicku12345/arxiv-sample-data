We give a positive answer to M. Traizet's open question about the existence of complete embedded minimal surfaces with Scherk-ends without planar geodesics. In the singly periodic case, these examples get close to an extension of Traizet's result concerning asymmetric complete minimal submanifolds of Euclidean space with finite total curvature.
