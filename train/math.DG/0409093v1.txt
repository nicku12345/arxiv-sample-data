In this lecture, we review some of the concepts of generalized geometry, as introduced by Hitchin and developed in the speaker's thesis. We also prove a Hodge decomposition for the twisted cohomology of a compact generalized K\"ahler manifold, as well as a generalization of the dd^c-lemma of K\"ahler geometry.
