Killing forms on Riemannian manifolds are differential forms whose covariant derivative is totally skew--symmetric. We show that a compact simply connected symmetric space carries a non--parallel Killing p--form (p\ge2) if and only if it isometric to a Riemannian product S^k\times N, where S^k is a round sphere and k>p.
