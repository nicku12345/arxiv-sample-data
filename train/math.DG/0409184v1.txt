In this paper we prove that an embedded and simply connected constant mean curvature surface with curvature large at a point contains a multi-valued graph around that point on the scale of |A|^2, where |A|^2 is the norm squared of the second fundamental form. This generalizes Colding and Minicozzi's result for minimal surfaces.
