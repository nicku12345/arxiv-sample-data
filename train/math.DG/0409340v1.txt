This is the first paper of two ones. Here we prove that two compact Alexandrov surfaces of bounded integral curvature having no peak points are bi-Lipschitz equivalent if they are homeomorphic one to the other. Also conditions under that two ends having finite integral negative curvature are bi-Lipschitz equivalent are considered. In the second paper it is shown that a bi-Lipschitz constant can be estimated depending on several geometric characteristics.
