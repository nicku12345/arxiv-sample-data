This is a continuation of the joint paper with the same title by A.Belenkiy and Yu.Burago. It is proved here that two homeomorphic closed Alexandrov surfaces (of bounded integral curvature) are bi-Lipschitz with a constant depending only on upper bounds of their Euler number, diameters, negative integral curvatures, and two positive numbers e and l such that positive curvature of each embedded disk with perimeter not greater than l is not greater than \pi-e.
