The goal of the present paper is to establish some kind of regularity of an energy minimizer map between Riemannian polyhedra. More precisely, we will show the h\"{o}lder continuity of local energy minimizers between Riemannian polyhedra with the target spaces without focal points. With this new result, we also complete our existence theorem obtained in [5], and consequently we generalize completely, to the case of target polyhedra without focal points (which is weaker geometric condition than the nonpositivity of the curvature), the Eells-fuglede's existence and regularity theorem [12, chapters 10, 11] which is the new version of the famous Eells-Sampson's theorem [13].
