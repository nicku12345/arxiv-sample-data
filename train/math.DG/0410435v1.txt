If the Lorentzian norm on a maximal surface in the 3-dimensional Lorentz-Minkowski space R_1^3 is positive and proper, then the surface is relative parabolic. As a consequence, entire maximal graphs with a closed set of isolated singularities are relative parabolic.   Furthermore, maximal and minimal graphs over closed starlike domains in R_1^3 and R^3, respectively, are relative parabolic.
