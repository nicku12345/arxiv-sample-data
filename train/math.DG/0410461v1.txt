We assume a vector bundle p: E\to M with a general linear connection K and a classical linear connection \Lam on M. We prove that all classical linear connections on the total space E naturally given by (\Lam, K) form a 15-parameter family. Further we prove that all connections on J^1 E naturally given by (\Lam, K) form a 14-parameter family. Both families of connections are described geometrically.
