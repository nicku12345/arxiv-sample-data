This note is a step towards demonstrating the benefits of a symplectic approach to studying equivariant K\"ahler geometry. We apply a local differential geometric framework from K\"ahler toric geometry due to Guillemin & Abreu to the case of the standard linear \SU(n) action on \bbC^n\setminus\{0\}. Using this framework we (re)construct a scalar-flat K\"ahler metric on the blow-up of \bbC^n at the origin from data on the moment polytope.
