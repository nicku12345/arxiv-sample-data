The authors establish a relation of the theory of varieties with degenerate Gauss maps in projective spaces with the theory of congruences and pseudocongruences of subspaces and show how these two theories can be applied to the construction of induced connections on submanifolds of projective spaces and other spaces endowed with a projective structure.
