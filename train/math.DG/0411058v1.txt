In this paper the author determines necessary and sufficient conditions for existence of the Ehresmann connection on a manifold foliated by locally free action of the commutative Lie group. Also here we describe structure of C_0(M)|_L for a leaf L \subset M in case such a connection exists. Finally we give some results on structure of the spectrum of the family of Schr\"odinger operators related to the leaves of the foliation.
