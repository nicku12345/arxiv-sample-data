We extend finite dimensional Chern-Simons theory to certain infinite dimensional principal bundles with connections, in particular to the frame bundle FLM\to LM over the loop space of a Riemannian manifold M. Chern-Simons forms are defined roughly as in finite dimensions with the invariant polynomials replaced by appropriate Wodzicki residues. This produces odd dimensional \R/\Z-valued cohomology classes on LM if M is parallelizable. We compute an example of a metric on the loop space of S^3\times S^1 for which the three dimensional Chern-Simons class is nontrivial.
