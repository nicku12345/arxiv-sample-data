We characterize general pseudo-harmonic morphisms from a Riemannian manifold to a Hermitian manifold as pseudo horizontally weakly conformal maps with an additional property. We study to what extent we can (locally) describe these submersive pseudo-harmonic morphisms via the foliation given by the kernel of the associated f-structure. In a second part, we point out that, in the case of pseudo-harmonic morphisms with one and two-dimensional fibers, the induced f-structure gives rise to an almost contact, respectively almost complex structure on the domain. We give criteria for normality and integrability of these structures and we show how these two particular cases are interrelated.
