Let (J,g) be a Hermitian structure on a compact nilmanifold M with invariant complex structure J and compatible metric g, which is not required to be invariant. We give classifications of 6-dimensional nilmanifolds M admitting strong K\"ahler with torsion, balanced or locally conformal K\"ahler structures (J,g).
