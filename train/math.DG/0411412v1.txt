The bending map of a hyperbolic 3-manifold maps a convex cocompact hyperbolic metric on a hyperbolic 3-manifold with boundary to its bending measured geodesic lamination. In the present paper we study the extension of this map to the space of geometrically finite hyperbolic metrics. We introduce a relationship on the space of measured geodesic laminations and shows that the quotient map obtained from the bending map is continuous.
