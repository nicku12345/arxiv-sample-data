We investigate complete minimal hypersurfaces in the Euclidean space % \ {R}^{4}, with Gauss-Kronecker curvature identically zero. We prove that, if f:M^{3}\to {R}^{4} is a complete minimal hypersurface with Gauss-Kronecker curvature identically zero, nowhere vanishing second fundamental form and scalar curvature bounded from below, then f(M^{3}) splits as a Euclidean product L^{2}\times {R}, where L^{2} is a complete minimal surface in  {R}^{3} with Gaussian curvature bounded from below.
