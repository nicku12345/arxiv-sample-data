Given a Finsler space (M,F) on a manifold M, the averaging method associates to Finslerian geometric objects affine geometric objects} living on M. In particular, a Riemannian metric is associated to the fundamental tensor g and an affine, torsion free connection is associated to the Chern-Rund connection. As an illustration of the technique, a generalization of the Gauss-Bonnet theorem to Berwald surfaces using the average metric is presented. The parallel transport and curvature endomorphisms of the average connection are obtained. The holonomy group for a Berwald space is discussed. New affine, local isometric invariants of the original Finsler metric. The heredity of the property of symmetric space from the Finsler space to the average Riemannian metric is proved.
