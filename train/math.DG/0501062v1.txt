We study the curvature of almost Hermitian manifolds and their special analogues via intrinsic torsion and representation theory. By deriving different forumlae for the skew-symmetric part of the star-Ricci curvature, we find that some of these contributions are dependent on the approach used, and for the almost Hermitian case we obtain tables that differ from those of Falcitelli, Farinola and Salamon. We show how the exterior algebra may used to explain some of these variations.
