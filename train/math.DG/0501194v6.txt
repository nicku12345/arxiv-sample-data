Grafting a measured lamination on a hyperbolic surface defines a self-map of Teichmuller space, which is a homeomorphism by a result of Scannell and Wolf. In this paper we study the large-scale behavior of pruning, which is the inverse of grafting.   Specifically, for each conformal structure X \in \T(S), pruning X gives a map \ML(S) \to \T(S). We show that this map extends to the Thurston compactification of \T(S), and that its boundary values are the natural antipodal involution relative to X on the space of projective measured laminations.   We use this result to study Thurston's grafting coordinates on the space of \CP^1 structures on S. For each X \in \T(S), we show that the boundary of the space P(X) of \CP^1 structures on X in the compactification of the grafting coordinates is the graph \Gamma(i_X) of the antipodal involution i_X : \PML(S) \to \PML(S).
