We describe a 3-parametric family \mathcal{K} of properly embedded minimal tori with four parallel ends in quotients of \mathbb{R}^3 by two independent translations, which we will call the \textit{Standard Examples.} These surfaces generalize the examples given by Karcher, Meeks and Rosenberg in \cite{ka4,ka6,mr3}. \mathcal{K} can be endowed with a natural structure of a self-conjugated 3-dimensional real analytic manifold diffeomorphic to \mathbb{R}\times(\mathbb{R}^2-\{(\pm 1,0)\}) whose degenerate limits are the catenoid, the helicoid, the simply and doubly periodic Scherk minimal surfaces and the Riemann minimal examples. Perez, Rodriguez and Traizet \cite{PeRoTra1} characterize \mathcal{K} in the following sense: If M is a properly embedded minimal torus in a quotient of \mathbb{R}^3 by two independent translations with any number of parallel ends, then M is a finite covering of a standard example.
