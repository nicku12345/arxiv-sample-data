This is the first paper in a series of eight where in the first three we develop a systematic approach to the geometric algebras of multivectors and extensors, followed by five papers where those algebraic concepts are used in a novel presentation of several topics of the differential geometry of (smooth) manifolds of arbitrary global topology. A key tool for the development of our program is the mastering of the euclidean geometrical algebra of multivectors that is detailed in the present paper.
