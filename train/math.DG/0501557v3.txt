In this paper, the second in a series of eight we continue our development of the basic tools of the multivector and extensor calculus which are used in our formulation of the differential geometry of smooth manifolds of arbitrary topology . We introduce metric and gauge extensors, pseudo-orthogonal metric extensors, gauge bases, tetrad bases and prove the remarkable golden formula, which permit us to view any Clifford algebra Cl(V,G) as a deformation of the euclidean Clifford algebra Cl(V,G_{E}) discussed in the first paper of the series and to easily perform calculations in Cl(V,G) using Cl(V,G_{E}).
