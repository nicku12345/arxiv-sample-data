The objective of the present paper (the second in a series of four) is to give a theory of multivector and extensor fields on a smooth manifold M of arbitrary topology based on the powerful geometric algebra of multivectors and extensors. Our approach does not suffer the problems of earlier attempts which are restricted to vector manifolds. It is based on the existence of canonical algebraic structures over the so-called canonical space associated to a local chart (U_{o},phi_{o}) of the maximal atlas of M. The key concepts of a-directional ordinary derivatives of multivector and extensor fields are defined and their properties studied. Also, we introduce the Lie algebra of smooth vector fields and the Hestenes derivatives whose properties are studied in details.
