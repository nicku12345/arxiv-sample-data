We consider manifolds of oriented flags SO(n)/SO(2)xSO(n-3) (n>=4) as 4- and 6-symmetric spaces and indicate characteristic conditions for invariant Riemannian metrics under which the canonical f-structures on these homogeneous \Phi-spaces belong to the classes Kill f, NKf and G_1f of generalized Hermitian geometry.
