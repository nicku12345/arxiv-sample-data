Manifolds endowed with three foliations pairwise transversal are known as 3-webs. Equivalently, they can be algebraically defined as biparacomplex or complex product manifolds, i.e., manifolds endowed with three tensor fields of type (1,1), F, P and J=F \circ P, where the two first are product and the third one is complex, and they mutually anti-commute. In this case, it is well known that there exists a unique torsion-free connection parallelizing the structure. In the present paper, we study connections attached to non-integrable almost biparacomplex manifolds.
