In this paper, we prove a generalization of Rado's Theorem, a fundamental result of minimal surface theory, which says that minimal surfaces over a convex domain with graphical boundaries must be disks which are themselves graphical. We will show that, for a minimal surface of any genus, whose boundary is "almost graphical" in some sense, that the surface must be graphical once we move sufficiently far from the boundary.
