We consider the reduced twistor space Z of an almost Hermitian manifold M, after O'Brian and Rawnsley (Ann. Global Anal. Geom., 1985). We concentrate on dimension 6. This space has a natural almost complex structure \mathcal J associated to the canonical Hermitian connection. A necessary condition for the integrability of \mathcal J on Z is that the manifold belongs to the class W_1 \oplus W_4 of Gray, Hervella. In a second part, we then show that the almost Hermitian manifolds of type W_1 \oplus W_4 are all locally conformally nearly K\"{a}hler in dimension 6. Finally, \mathcal J is integrable if and only if M is locally conformal to the sphere S^6 or to a Bochner-flat K\"{a}hler manifold.
