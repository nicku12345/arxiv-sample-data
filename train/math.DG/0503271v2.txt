Consider a closed manifold M immersed in \R^m. Suppose that the trivial bundle M\times\R^m=TM\otimes \nu M is equipped with an almost metric connection \tilde{\nabla} which almost preserves the decomposition of M\times\R^m into the tangent and the normal bundle. Assume moreover that the difference \Gamma=\partial-\tilde{\nabla} with the usual derivative \partial in \R^m is almost \tilde{\nabla}-parallel. We show that under these assumptions M admits an extrinsically homogeneous immersion into \R^m.
