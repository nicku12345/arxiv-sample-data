The twistor space \Z of an oriented Riemannian 4-manifold M admits a natural 1-parameter family of Riemannian metrics h_t compatible with the almost complex structures J_1 and J_2 introduced, respectively, by Atiyah, Hitchin and Singer, and Eells and Salamon. In this paper we compute the first Chern form of the almost Hermitian manifold (\Z,h_t,J_n), n=1,2 and find the geometric conditions on M under which the curvature of its Chern connection D^n is of type (1,1). We also describe the twistor spaces of constant holomorphic sectional curvature with respect to D^n and show that the Nijenhuis tensor of J_2 is D^2-parallel provided the base manifold M is Einstein and self-dual.
