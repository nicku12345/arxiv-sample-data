We prove that certain Riemannian manifolds can be isometrically embedded inside Calabi-Yau manifolds. For example we prove that given any real-analytic one parameter family of Riemannian metrics g_t on a 3-dimensional manifold Y with volume form independent of t and with a real-analytic family of nowhere vanishing harmonic one forms \theta_t, then (Y, g_t) can be realized as a family of special Lagrangian submanifolds of a Calabi-Yau manifold X. We also prove that certain principal torus bundles can be equivariantly and isometrically embedded inside Calabi-Yau manifolds with torus action. We use this to construct examples of n-parameter families of special Lagrangian tori inside n+k-dimensional Calabi-Yau manifolds with torus symmetry. We also compute McLean's metric of 3-dimensional special Lagrangian fibrations with T^2-symmetry.
