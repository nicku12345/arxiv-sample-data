We collect the recent results on invariant f-structures in the generalized Hermitian geometry. Here the canonical f-structures on homogeneous k-symmetric spaces play a remarkable role. Specifically, these structures provide a wealth of invariant examples for the classes of nearly Kaehler f-structures, Hermitian f-structures and some others. Finally, we consider all invariant f-structures on the complex flag manifold SU(3)/T_{max} and describe them in the sense of generalized Hermitian geometry. In particular, it presents first invariant examples of Killing f-structures.
