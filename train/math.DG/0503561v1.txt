It is well-known that if \xi is a smooth vector field on a given Riemannian manifold M^n then \xi naturally defines a submanifold \xi(M^n) transverse to the fibers of the tangent bundle TM^n with Sasaki metric. In this paper, we are interested in transverse totally geodesic submanifolds of the tangent bundle. We show that a transverse submanifold N^l of TM^n (1 \leq l \leq n) can be realized locally as the image of a submanifold F^l of M^n under some vector field \xi defined along F^l. For such images \xi(F^l), the conditions to be totally geodesic are presented. We show that these conditions are not so rigid as in the case of l=n, and we treat several special cases (\xi of constant length, \xi normal to F^l, M^n of constant curvature, M^n a Lie group and \xi a left invariant vector field)
