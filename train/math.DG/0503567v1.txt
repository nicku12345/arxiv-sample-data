We present an explicit formula for the mean curvature of a unit vector field on a Riemannian manifold, using a special but natural frame. As applications, we treat some known and new examples of minimal unit vector fields. We also give an example of a vector field of constant mean curvature on the Lobachevsky (n+1) space.
