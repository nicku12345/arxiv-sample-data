We prove that the Hopf vector field is a unique one among geodesic covariantly normal unit vector fields on spheres such that the submanifold generated by the field is totally geodesic in the unit tangent bundle with Sasaki metric. As application, we give a new proof of stability (instability) of the Hopf vector field with respect to volume variation using standard approach from the theory of submanifolds and find exact boundaries for the sectional curvature of the Hopf vector field.
