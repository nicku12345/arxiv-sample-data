We give a conformal representation in terms of meromorphic data for a certain class of spacelike surfaces in the Lorentz-Minkowski 4-space L^4 whose mean curvature vector is either lightlike or zero at each point. This representation extends simultaneously the Weierstrass representation for minimal surfaces in Euclidean 3-space and for maximal surfaces in the Lorentz-Minkowski 3-space, and the Bryant representation for mean curvature one surfaces in the hyperbolic 3-space and in the de Sitter 3-space.
