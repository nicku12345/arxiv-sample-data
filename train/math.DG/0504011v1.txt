We investigate 3-dimensional complete minimal hypersurfaces in the hyperbolic space \mathbb{H}^{4} with Gauss-Kronecker curvature identically zero. More precisely, we give a classification of complete minimal hypersurfaces with Gauss-Kronecker curvature identically zero, nowhere vanishing second fundamental form and scalar curvature bounded from below.
