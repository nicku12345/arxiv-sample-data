We investigate surfaces with constant harmonic-mean curvature one (HMC-1 surfaces) in hyperbolic three-space. We allow them to have certain kinds of singularities, and discuss some global properties. As well as flat surfaces and surfaces with constant mean curvature one (CMC-1 surfaces), HMC-1 surfaces belong to a certain class of Weingarten surfaces. From the viewpoint of parallel surfaces, CMC-1 surfaces and HMC-1 surfaces are representative among this class.
