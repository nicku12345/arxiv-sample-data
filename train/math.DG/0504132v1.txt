The {\em focal curve} of an immersed smooth curve \gamma:s\mapsto \gamma(s), in Euclidean space \R^{m+1}, consists of the centres of its osculating hyperspheres. The focal curve may be parametrised in terms of the Frenet frame of \gamma ({\bf t},{\bf n}_1, ...,{\bf n}_m), as C_\gamma(s)=(\gamma+c_1{\bf n}_1+c_2{\bf n}_2+...+c_m{\bf n}_m)(s), where the coefficients c_1,...,c_{m-1} are smooth functions that we call the {\em focal curvatures} of \gamma. We discovered a remarkable formula relating the Euclidean curvatures \kappa_i, i=1,...,m, of \gamma with its focal curvatures. We show that the focal curvatures satisfy a system of Frenet equations (not vectorial, but scalar!). We use the properties of the focal curvatures in order to give, for k=1,...,m, necessary and sufficient conditions for the radius of the osculating k-dimensional sphere to be critical. We also give necessary and sufficient conditions for a point of \gamma to be a vertex. Finally, we show explicitly the relations of the Frenet frame and the Euclidean curvatures of \gamma with the Frenet frame and the Euclidean curvatures of its focal curve C_\gamma.
