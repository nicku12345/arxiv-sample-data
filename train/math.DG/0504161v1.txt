After analyzing renormalization schemes on a Poincar\'e-Einstein manifold, we study the renormalized integrals of scalar Riemannian invariants. The behavior of the renormalized volume is well-known, and we show any scalar Riemannian invariant renormalizes similarly. We consider characteristic forms and their behavior under a variation of the Poincar\'e-Einstein structure, and obtain, from the renormalized integral of the Pfaffian, an extension of the Gauss-Bonnet theorem.
