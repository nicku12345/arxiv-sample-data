We give a criterion of (micro-)kroneckerity of the linear Poisson pencil on \frak{g}^* related to an algebraic Nijenhuis operator N:\frak{g}\to \frak{g} on a finite-dimensional Lie algebra \frak{g}. As an application we get a series of examples of completely integrable systems on semisimple Lie algebras related to Borel subalgebras and a new proof of the complete integrability of the free rigid body system on \frak{gl}_n.
