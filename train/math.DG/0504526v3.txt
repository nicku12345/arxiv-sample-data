In this paper we prove the compactness result for compact K\"ahler Ricci gradient shrinking solitons. If (M_i,g_i) is a sequence of K\"ahler Ricci solitons of real dimension n \ge 4, whose curvatures have uniformly bounded L^{n/2} norms, whose Ricci curvatures are uniformly bounded from below and \mu(g_i,1/2) \ge A (where \mu is Perelman's functional), there is a subsequence (M_i,g_i) converging to a compact orbifold (M_{\infty},g_{\infty}) with finitely many isolated singularitites, where g_{\infty} is a K\"ahler Ricci soliton metric in an orbifold sense (satisfies a soliton equation away from singular points and smoothly extends in some gauge to a metric satisfying K\"ahler Ricci soliton equation in a lifting around singular points).
