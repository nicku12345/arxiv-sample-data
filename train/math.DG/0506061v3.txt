This paper proves a positive energy-momentum theorem for oriented Riemannian 3-manifolds that are asymptotic to a standard hyperbolic slice in anti de Sitter space-time. Analogously to the original Witten's proof in the asymptotically flat case, this result relies on spinorial methods. We also give a rigidity theorem: if the energy-momentum is degenerate (in a certain sense) then our 3-manifold can be isometrically embedded in anti de Sitter.
