We study the lightlike foliations that appear on Lorentzian manifolds with weakly irreducible not irreducible holonomy algebra. We give global structure equations for the foliation that generalize the Gauss and Weingarten equations for one lightlike hypersurface. This gives us some global operators on the manifold. Using these operators, we decompose the curvature tensor of the manifold into several components. We give a criteria how to find the type of the holonomy algebras (there are 4 possible types) in terms of the global operators.
