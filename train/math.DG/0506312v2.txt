We study isometric Lie group actions on symmetric spaces admitting a section, i.e. a submanifold which meets all orbits orthogonally at every intersection point. We classify such actions on the compact symmetric spaces with simple isometry group and rank greater than one. In particular we show that these actions are hyperpolar, i.e. the sections are flat.
