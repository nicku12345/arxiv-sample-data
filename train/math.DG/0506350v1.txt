Let \Gamma be the fundamental group of a compact n-dimensional riemannian manifold X of sectional curvature bounded above by -1. We suppose that \Gamma is a free product of its subgroup A and B over the amalgamated subgroup C. We prove that the critical exponent \delta(C) of C satisfies \delta(C) \geq n-2. The equality happens if and only if there exist an embedded compact hypersurface Y in X, totally geodesic, of constant sectional curvature -1, with fundamental group C and which separates X in two connected components whose fundamental groups are A and B. Similar results hold if \Gamma is an HNN extension, or more generally if \Gamma acts on a simplicial tree without fixed point.
