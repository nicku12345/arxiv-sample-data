We study the six-dimensional pseudo-Riemannian spaces with two time-like coordinates that admit non-homothetic infinitesimal projective transformations. The metrics are manifestly obtained and the projective group properties are determined. We also find a generic defining of projective motion in the 6-dimensional rigid h-space.
