We prove a Pohozaev type identity for non-linear eigenvalue equations of the Dirac operator on Riemannian spin manifolds with boundary. As an application, we obtain that the mean curvature H of a conformal immersion S^{n}-> R^{n+1} satisfies \int \partial_X H=0 where X is a conformal vector field on S^{n} and where the integration is carried out with respect to the Euclidean volume measure of the image.<BR> This identity is analogous to the Kazdan-Warner obstruction that appears in the problem of prescribing the scalar curvature on S^{n} inside the standard conformal class.
