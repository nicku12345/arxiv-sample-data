Using Schauder's theory for linear elliptic partial differential equations in two independent variables and fundamental estimates for univalent mappings due to E. Heinz we establish an upper bound of the Gaussian curvature of two-dimensional minimal surface graphs in R^n. This leads us to a theorem of Bernstein-Liouville type.
