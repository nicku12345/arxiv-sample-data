In this paper we study the topology of compact manifolds of positive isotropic curvature (PIC). There are many examples of non-simply connected compact manifolds with positive isotropic curvature. We prove that the fundamental group of a compact Riemannian manifold with PIC, of dimension greater than or equal to 5, does not contain a subgroup isomorphic to the fundamental group of a compact Riemann surface. The proof uses stable minimal surface theory.
