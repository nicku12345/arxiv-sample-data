We prove the universal lifting theorem: for an \alpha-simply connected and \alpha-connected Lie groupoid \gm with Lie algebroid A, the graded Lie algebra of multi-differentials on A is isomorphic to that of multiplicative multi-vector fields on \gm. As a consequence, we obtain the integration theorem for a quasi-Lie bialgebroid, which generalizes various integration theorems in the literature in special cases.   The second goal of the paper is the study of basic properties of quasi-Poisson groupoids. In particular, we prove that a group pair (D, G) associated to a Manin quasi-triple (\mathfrak d, \mathfrak g, \mathfrak h) induces a quasi-Poisson groupoid on the transformation groupoid G\times D/G\toto D/G. Its momentum map corresponds exactly with the D/G-momentum map of Alekseev and Kosmann-Schwarzbach.
