Consider L a regular Lagrangian, S the canonical semispray, and h the horizontal projector of the canonical nonlinear connection. We prove that if the Lagrangian is constant along the integral curves of the Euler-Lagrange equations then it is constant along the horizontal curves of the canonical nonlinear connection. In other words S(L)=0 implies d_hL=0. If the Lagrangian L is homogeneous of order k\neq 1 then L is a conservation law and hence d_hL=0. We give an example of nonhomogeneous Lagrangians for which d_hL\neq 0.
