In this paper, we prove the compactness theorem for gradient Ricci solitons. Let (M_{\alpha}, g_{\alpha}) be a sequence of compact gradient Ricci solitons of dimension n\geq 4, whose curvatures have uniformly bounded L^{\frac{n}{2}} norms, whose Ricci curvatures are uniformly bounded from below with uniformly lower bounded volume and with uniformly upper bounded diameter, then there must exists a subsequence (M_{\alpha}, g_{\alpha}) converging to a compact orbifold (M_{\infty}, g_{\infty}) with finitly many isolated singularities, where g_{\infty} is a gradient Ricci soliton metric in an orbifold sense.
