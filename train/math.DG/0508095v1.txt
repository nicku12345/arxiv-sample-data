We prove that a d-web near a point in n-space, where n is greater than 2 and d is greater than 2n-1, is equivalent to an algebraic web, if it has maximal rank or, more generally, if it has (2d - 3n + 1) abelian relations the 1-jets of which are linearly independent.   In case n=3, this is a theorem of Bol. The general case answers a question of Chern and Griffiths.
