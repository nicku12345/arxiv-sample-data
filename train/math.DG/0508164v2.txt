Let (M^{n},g) be a closed, connected, oriented, C^{\infty}, Riemannian, n-manifold with a transversely oriented foliation \boldkey F. We show that if \lbrace X,Y \rbrace are basic vector fields, the leaf component of [X,Y], \Cal{V}[X,Y], has vanishing leaf divergence whenever {\kappa}\wedge \chi_{\boldkey F} is a closed (possibly zero) de Rham cohomology (p+1)-form. Here {\kappa} is the mean curvature one-form of the foliation {\boldkey F} and {\chi_{\boldkey F}} is its characteristic form. In the codimension-2 case, {\kappa}\wedge \chi_{\boldkey F} is closed if and only if {\kappa} is horizontally closed. In certain restricted cases, we give necessary and sufficient conditions for {\kappa}\wedge{\chi_{\boldkey F}} to be harmonic. As an application, we give a characterization of when certain closed 3-manifolds are locally Riemannian products. We show that bundle-like foliations with totally umbilical leaves with leaf dimension greater than or equal to two on a constant curvature manifold, with non-integrable transversal distribution, and with Einstein-like transversal geometry are totally geodesic.
