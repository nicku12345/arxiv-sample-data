Using Laurent expansions of the Kontsevich-Vishik canonical trace of holomorphic families of classical pseudodifferential operators, we define functionals on the space of Riemannian metrics and investigate their conformal properties, thereby giving a unified description of several conformal invariants and anomalies.
