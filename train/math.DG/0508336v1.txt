We study the constant mean curvature (CMC) hypersurfaces in hyperbolic space whose asymptotic boundaries are closed codimension-1 submanifolds in sphere at infinity. We consider CMC hypersurfaces as generalizations of minimal hypersurfaces. We naturally generalize some notions of minimal hypersurfaces like being area minimizing, convex hull property, exchange roundoff trick to the CMC hypersurface context. We also give a generic uniqueness result for CMC hypersurfaces in hyperbolic space.
