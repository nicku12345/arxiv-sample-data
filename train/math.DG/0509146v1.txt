In some other context, the question was raised how many nearly K\"ahler structures exist on the sphere \S^6 equipped with the standard Riemannian metric. In this short note, we prove that, up to isometry, there exists only one.   This is a consequence of the description of the eigenspace to the eigenvalue \lambda = 12 of the Laplacian acting on 2-forms. A similar result concerning nearly parallel \G_2-structures on the round sphere \S^7 holds, too. An alternative proof by Riemannian Killing spinors is also indicated.
