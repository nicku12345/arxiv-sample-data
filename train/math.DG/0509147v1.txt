We study geometric structures of \mathcal{W}_4-type in the sense of A. Gray on a Riemannian manifold. If the structure group \mathrm{G} \subset \SO(n) preserves a spinor or a non-degenerate differential form, its intrinsic torsion \Gamma is a closed 1-form (Proposition \ref{dGamma} and Theorem \ref{Fixspinor}). Using a \mathrm{G}-invariant spinor we prove a splitting theorem (Proposition \ref{splitting}). The latter result generalizes and unifies a recent result obtained in \cite{Ivanov&Co}, where this splitting has been proved in dimensions n=7,8 only. Finally we investigate geometric structures of vectorial type and admitting a characteristic connection \nabla^{\mathrm{c}}. An interesting class of geometric structures generalizing Hopf structures are those with a \nabla^{\mathrm{c}}-parallel intrinsic torsion \Gamma. In this case, \Gamma induces a Killing vector field (Proposition \ref{Killing}) and for some special structure groups it is even parallel.
