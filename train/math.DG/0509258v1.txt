We prove the nonexistence of a proper singular Riemannian foliation admitting section in compact manifolds of nonpositive curvature. Then we give a global description of proper singular Riemannian foliations admitting sections on Hadamard manifolds. In addition by using the theory of taut immersions we provide a short proof of this result in the special case of a polar action.
