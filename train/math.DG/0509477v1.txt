This paper is devoted to the study of convergence of sequences of solutions to the constant mean curvature H equation. The convergence domain is defined. The main Theorem characterizes the complement of this convergence domain: it shows that circle arcs of curvature 2H compose this complement. We then give results which allow us to use this theorem.
