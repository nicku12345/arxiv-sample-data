Evolutionary forms, as well as exterior forms, are skew-symmetric differential forms. But in contrast to the exterior forms, the basis of evolutionary forms is deforming manifolds (with unclosed metric forms). Such forms possess a peculiarity, namely, the closed inexact exterior forms are obtained from that.   The closure conditions of inexact exterior form (vanishing the differentials of exterior and dual forms) point out to the fact that the closed inexact exterior form is a quantity conserved on pseudostructure having the dual form as the metric form. We obtain that the closed inexact exterior form and corresponding dual form made up a conservative object, i.e. a quantity conserved on pseudostructure. Such conservative object corresponds to the conservation law and is a differential-geometrical structure.   Transition from the evolutionary form to the closed inexact exterior form describes the process of generating the differential-geometrical structures. This transition is possible only as a degenerate transformation, the condition of which is a realization of a certain symmetry.   Physical structures that made up physical fields are such differential-geometrical structures. And they are generated by material systems (medias). Relevant symmetries are caused by the degrees of freedom of material system.
