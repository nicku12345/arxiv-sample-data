The intertwining operator constructed in [Sz1,Sz2] does not appear in the right form. It is established there by using only the anticommutators. The correct operator must involve all endomorphisms, which are unified by the Z-Fourier transform. Although some of the correct elements of the previous constructions are kept, this idea is established by a new technique which yields the various isospectrality theorems stated in the papers on a much larger scale. The new results include new isospectrality examples living on sphereXball- and sphereXsphere-type manifolds. Among them, there are such discrete isospectrality families where one of the members is homogeneous while the others are locally inhomogeneous (striking examples). Furthermore, a large class of new isospectrality families are constructed by \sigma deformations.
