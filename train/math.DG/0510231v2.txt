The classical Arzela-Ascoli theorem is a compactness result for families of functions depending on bounds on the derivatives of the functions, and is of invaluable use in many fields of mathemathics. In this paper, inspired by a result of Corlette, we prove an analogous compactness result for families of immersed submanifolds which depends only on bounds on the derivatives of the second fundamental forms of these submanifolds. We then show how the result of Corlette may be obtained as an immediate corollary.
