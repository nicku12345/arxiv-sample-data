We compare two relationships between quadratic differentials and measured geodesic laminations on hyperbolic Riemann surfaces (by foliations or complex projective structures). Each yields a homeomorphism \ML(S) \to Q(X) for any conformal structure X on a compact surface S. The main result is that these maps are nearly the same, differing by a multiplicative factor of -2 and an error term of lower order than the maps themselves (which we bound explicitly).   As an application we show that the Schwarzian derivative of a \CP^1 structure with Fuchsian holonomy is close to a 2\pi-integral Jenkins-Strebel differential. We also study compactifications of the space of \CP^1 structures using the Schwarzian derivative and grafting coordinates; we show that the natural map between these extends to the boundary of each fiber over Teichmuller space, and we describe this extension.
