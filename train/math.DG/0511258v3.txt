We define a notion of isotropic surfaces in \mathbb{O}, i.e. on which some canonical symplectic forms vanish. Using the cross-product in \mathbb{O} we define a map \rho\colon Gr\_2(\mathbb{O})\to S^6 from the Grassmannian of \mathbb{O} to S^6. This allows us to associate to each surface \Sigma of \mathbb{O} a function \rho\_{\Sigma}\colon \Sigma\to S^6. Then we show that the isotropic surfaces in \mathbb{O} such that \rho\_{\Sigma} is harmonic are solutions of a completely integrable system. Using loop groups we construct a Weierstrass type representation of these surfaces. By restriction to  \mathbb{H}\subset\mathbb{O} we obtain as a particular case the Hamiltonian Stationary Lagrangian surfaces of \mathbb{R}^4, and by restriction to \text{Im}(\mathbb{H}) we obtain the CMC surfaces of \mathbb{R}^3.
