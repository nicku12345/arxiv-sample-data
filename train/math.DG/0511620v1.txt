In this paper, we obtain two-sided bounds for the volumes of the Aloff-Wallach spaces W(p,q), compute maximal and minimal sectional curvature for the spaces W(n,n+1), and use this information to estimate the injectivity radii: We derive an upper bound for the injectivity radii of W(p,q) and a lower bound for the injectivity radii of W(n,n+1).
