If M is an isoparametric hypersurface in a sphere S^n with four distrinct principal curvatures, then the principal curvatures \kappa_1,...,\kappa_4 can be ordered so that their multiplicities satisfy m_1=m_2 and m_3=m_4, and the cross-ratio r of the principal curvatures (the Lie curvature) equals -1. In this paper, we prove that if M is an irreducible connected proper Dupin hypersurface in \R^n (or S^n) with four distinct principal curvatures with multiplicities m_1=m_2 \geq 1 and m_3=m_4=1, and constant Lie curvature r=-1, then M is equivalent by Lie sphere transformation to an isoparametric hypersurface in a sphere. This result remains true if the assumption of irreducibility is replaced by compactness and r is merely assumed to be constant.
