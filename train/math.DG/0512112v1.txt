We consider minimal immersions in MxR. We study existence and uniqueness of associate and conjugate isometric immersions to a given minimal surface. We use the theory of univalent harmonic map between surfaces. Then we study the geometry of associate minimal vertical graphs. We prove that an associate surface of a vertical graph on a convex domain is a graph. In the classical theory it is a theorem of R. Krust.
