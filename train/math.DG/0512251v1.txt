The theory of differential characters is developed completely from a de Rham - Federer viewpoint. Characters are defined as equivalence classes of special currents, called sparks, which appear naturally in the theory of singular connections. There are many different spaces of currents which yield the character groups. A multiplication of de Rham-Federer characters is defined using transversality results for flat and rectifiable currents. There is a natural equivalence of ring functors from deRham - Federer characters to Cheeger-Simons characters. Differential characters have a topology and natural smooth Pontrjagin duals (introduced here). A principal result is the formulation and proof of duality for characters on oriented manifolds. It is shown that the pairing (a,b) --> a*b([X]) given by multiplication and evaluation on the fundamental cycle, gives an isomorphism of the group of differential characters of degree k with the dual to characters in degree n-k-1 where n = dim(X). It is also shown that there are natural Thom homomorphisms for differential characters. Gysin maps are also defined for differential characters. Many examples including Morse sparks, Hodge sparks and characteristic sparks are examined in detail.
