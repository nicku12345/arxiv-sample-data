In this paper we study Moebius applicable surfaces, i.e., conformally immersed surfaces in Moebius 3-space which admit deformations preserving the Moebius metric.   We show new characterizations of Willmore surfaces, Bonnet surfaces and Harmonic inverse mean curvature surfaces in terms of Moebius or similarity invariants.
