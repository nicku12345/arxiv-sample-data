We prove Hessian comparison theorems, Laplacian comparison theorems and volume comparison theorems of Finsler manifolds under various curvature conditions. As applications, we derive Mckean type theorems for the first eigenvalue of Finsler manifolds, as well as generalize a result on fundamental group due to Milnor to Finsler manifolds.
