Let E be a principle bundle over a compact manifold M with compact structural group G. For any G-invariant polynomial P, The transgressive forms TP(\omega) defined by Chern and Simons are shown to extend to forms \Phi P(\omega) on associated bundles B with fiber a quotient F=G/H of the group. These forms satisfy a heterotic formula d\Phi P(\omega)=P(\Omega)-P(\Psi), relating the characteristic form P(\Omega) to a fiber-curvature characteristic form. For certain natural bundles B, P(\Psi)=0, giving a true transgressive form on the associated bundle, which leads to the standard obstruction properties of characteristic classes as well as natural expressions for boundary terms.
