Let \rho_n(V) be the number of complete hyperbolic manifolds of dimension n with volume less than V. Burger, Gelander, Lubotzky, and Moses showed that when n>3 there exist a,b>0 depending on the dimension such that aV log(V) < log(\rho_n(V)) < bV log(V), for V >> 0. In this note, we use their methods to bound the number of hyperbolic manifolds with diameter less than d and show that the number grows double-exponentially. Additionally, this bound holds in dimension 3.
