We show that a complete m-dimensional immersed submanifold M of \mathbb{R}^{n} with a(M)<1 is properly immersed and have finite topology, where a(M)\in [0,\infty] is an scaling invariant number that gives the rate that the norm of the second fundamental form decays to zero at infinity. The class of submanifolds M with a(M)<1 contains all complete minimal surfaces in \mathbb{R}^{n} with finite total curvature, all m-dimensional minimal submanifolds M  of  \mathbb{R}^{n} with finite total scalar curvature \smallint_{M}| \alpha |^{m} dV<\infty  and all complete 2-dimensional complete surfaces with \smallint_{M}| \alpha |^{2} dV<\infty  and nonpositive curvature with respect to every normal direction, since a(M)=0 for them.
