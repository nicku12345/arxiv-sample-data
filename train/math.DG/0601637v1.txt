We deal with the minimal Lagrangian surfaces of the Einstein-K\"ahler surface S^2 \times S^2, studying local geometric properties and showing that they can be locally described as Gauss maps of minimal surfaces in S^3 \subset R^4. We also discuss the second variation of the area and characterize the most relevant examples by their stability behaviour.
