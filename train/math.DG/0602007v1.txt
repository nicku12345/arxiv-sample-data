We study the global behavior of (weakly) stable constant mean curvature hypersurfaces in general Riemannian manifolds. By using harmonic function theory, we prove some one-end theorems which are new even for constant mean curvature hypersurfaces in space forms.   In particular, a complete oriented weakly stable minimal hypersurface in \mathbb{R}^{n+1}, n\geq 3, must have only one end. Any complete noncompact weakly stable CMC H-hypersurface in the hyperbolic space \mathbb{H}^{n+1}, n=3,4, with H^2\geq{10/9}, {7/4}, respectively, has only one end.
