The aim of this paper is to show that any stable complete Riemannian flag on a compact and connected manifold is conjugated to a flag of homogenus foliations (see Definitions). Also, we give a characterization of Riemannian flags that homogenus. This result is a step toward the classification of Riemannian flags.
