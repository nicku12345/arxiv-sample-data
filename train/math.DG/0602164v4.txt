The purpose of this paper is to show that any extension of a minimal Lie foliation on a compact manifold is a transversaly Riemannian g\h- foliation with trivial normal bundle. This result permits to classify the extensions of a minimal Lie foliation on a compact manifold from the Lie subgroups of its Lie group.
