This is a survey paper on several aspects of differential geometry for the last 30 years, especially in those areas related to non-linear analysis. It grew from a talk I gave on the occasion of seventieth anniversary of Chinese Mathematical Society. I dedicate the lecture to the memory of my teacher S.S. Chern who had passed away in December 2004.
