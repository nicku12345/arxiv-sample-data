We consider spacelike graphs \Gamma_f of simple products (M\times N, g\times -h) where (M,g) and (N,h) are Riemannian manifolds and f:M\to N is a smooth map. Under the condition of the Cheeger constant of M to be zero and some condition on the second fundamental form at infinity, we conclude that if \Gamma_f \subset M\times N has parallel mean curvature H then H=0. This holds trivially if M is closed. If M is the m-hyperbolic space then for any constant c, we describe a explicit foliation of H^m\times R by hypersurfaces with constant mean curvature c.
