Motivated by the prescribing scalar curvature problem, we study the equation \Delta_g u +Ku^p=0 (1+\zeta \leq p \leq \frac{n+2}{n-2}) on locally conformally flat manifolds (M,g) with R(g)=0. We prove that when K satisfies certain conditions and the dimension of M is 3 or 4, any solution u of this equation with bounded energy has uniform upper and lower bounds. Similar techniques can also be applied to prove that on 4-dimensional scalar positive manifolds the solutions of \Delta_gu-\frac{n-2}{4(n-1)}R(g)u+Ku^p=0, K>0, 1+\zeta \leq p \leq \frac{n+2}{n-2} can only have simple blow-up points.
