We give an alternative proof of the mod p vanishing theorem by F.Fang of Seiberg-Witten invariants under a cyclic group action of prime order, and generalize it to the case when b_1>0. Although we also use the finite dimensional approximation of the monopole map as well as Fang, our method is rather geometric. Furthermore, non-trivial examples of mod p vanishing are given.
