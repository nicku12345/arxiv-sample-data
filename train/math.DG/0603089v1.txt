The present paper is a continuation of Le Anh Vu's ones [13], [14], [15]. Specifically, the paper is concerned with the subclass of connected and simply connected MD5-groups such that their MD5-algebras \mathcal{G} have the derived ideal {\mathcal{G}}^{1} : = [ \mathcal{G},\mathcal{G} ]\equiv {\bf{R}}^{3}. We shall describe the geometry of K-orbits of these MD5-groups. The foliations formed by K-orbits of maximal dimension of these MD5-groups and their measurability are also presented in the paper.
