In this note we construct a first example of a closed 3-form of \tilde G_2-type on S^3\times S^4. We prove that S^3\times S^4 does not admit a homogeneous   3-form of \tilde G_2-type. Thus our example is a first example of a closed 3-form of \tilde G_2-type on a compact 7-manifold which is not stably homogeneous.
