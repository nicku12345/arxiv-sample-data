We prove some pinching results for the extrinsic radius of compact hypersurfaces in space forms. We show that if the pinching condion is strong enough with a dependance on the norm of the second foundamental form, then the hypersurface is diffeomorphic and almost isometric to a geodesic hypersphere.
