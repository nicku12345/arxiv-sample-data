We prove that no nilpotent Lie algebra admits an invariant generalized Kaehler structure. This is done by showing that a certain differential graded algebra associated to a generalized complex manifold is formal in the generalized Kaehler case, while it is never formal for a generalized complex structure on a nilpotent Lie algebra.
