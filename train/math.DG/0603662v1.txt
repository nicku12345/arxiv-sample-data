We prove the existence of a one parameter family of minimal embedded hypersurfaces in R^{n+1}, for n \geq 3, which generalize the well known 2 dimensional "Riemann minimal surfaces". The hypersurfaces we obtain are complete, embedded, simply periodic hypersurfaces which have infinitely many parallel hyperplanar ends. By opposition with the 2-dimensional case, they are not foliated by spheres.
