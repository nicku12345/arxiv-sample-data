We propose studies of special Riemannian geometries with structure groups H_1=SO(3)\subset SO(5), H_2=SU(3)\subset SO(8), H_3=Sp(3)\subset SO(14) and H_4=F_4\subset SO(26) in respective dimensions 5, 8, 14 and 26. These geometries, have torsionless models with symmetry groups G_1=SU(3), G_2=SU(3)\times SU(3), G_3=SU(6) and G_4=E_6. The groups H_k and G_k constitute a part of the `magic square' for Lie groups. Apart from the H_k geometries in dimensions n_k, the `magic square' Lie groups suggest studies of a finite number of other special Riemannian geometries. Among them the smallest dimensional are U(3) geometries in dimension 12. The other structure groups for these Riemannian geometries are: S(U(3)\times U(3)), U(6), E_6\times SO(2), Sp(3)\times SU(2), SU(6)\times SU(2), SO(12)\times SU(2) and E_7\times SU(2). The respective dimensions are: 18, 30, 54, 28, 40, 64 and 112. This list is supplemented by the two `exceptional' cases of SU(2)\times SU(2) geometries in dimension 8 and SO(10)\times SO(2) geometries in dimension 32.
