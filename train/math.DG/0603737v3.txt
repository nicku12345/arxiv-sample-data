In this paper we have proved several approximation theorems for the family of minimal surfaces in R^3 that imply, among other things, that complete minimal surfaces are dense in the space of all minimal surfaces endowed with the topology of C^k convergence on compact sets, for any k.   As a consequence of the above density result, we have been able to produce the first example of a complete proper minimal surface in R^3 with uncountably many ends.
