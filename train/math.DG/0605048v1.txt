A prime geodesic theorem is proven for singular geodesics in quotients of SL(4). This is a case where regularity assumptions of previous papers fail. As a consequence, the analysis becomes much more involved. For applications in number theory (class number asymptotics) it is, however, necessary to consider this case, too.
