The known manifolds of positive sectional curvature are either homogeneous spaces or biquotients, i.e. quotients of a compact Lie group by a group acting on the left and right simultaneously. The full isometry group of the homogeneous metrics of positive curvature were determined by K.Shankar. Here we determine the isometry group of some of the biquotients due to Eschenburg and Bazaikin. As an application we obtain, as in the homogeneous case, more counterexamples to the Chern conjecture, which states that an abelian subgroup of the fundamental group of a positively curved manifold is cyclic.
