We consider a connected symplectic manifold M acted on by a connected Lie group G in a Hamiltonian fashion. If G is compact, we prove give an Equivalence Theorem for the symplectic manifolds whose squared moment map \parallel \mu \parallel^2 is constant. This result works also in the almost-K\"ahler setting. Then we study the case when G is a non compact Lie group acting properly on M and we prove a splitting results for symplectic manifolds.
