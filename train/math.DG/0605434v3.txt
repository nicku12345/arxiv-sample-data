Let (M,g) be a 3-dimensional compact connected real analytic Lorentz manifold and suppose that g is locally homogeneous on a non-empty open set in M (the pseudogroup of local isometries of g has an open orbit). Then we prove that g is locally homogeneous on M (the pseudogroup of local isometries is transitive on M).
