Banyaga has shown that the group of symplectomorphisms Symp(N) of a compact symplectic manifold (N,w) determines the symplectic structure. This motivates the study of the homotopy properties of Symp(N). Gromov has shown that the group of symplectomorphisms of N is homotopic to SO(3)\times SO(3) when N is the product of two spheres endowed with the standard symplectic form. This result generalizes the study of the homotopy type of the group of diffeomorphisms of closed surfaces, by replacing the space of complex structures by pseudo-complex structures adapted to w. A complex structure on a surface induces on it a projective structure, the purpose of this paper is to study the action of Symp(N) on homogeneous structures defined on N, and to deduce homotopy properties of Symp(N).
