If W_+ denotes the self dual part of the Weyl tensor of any K\"ahler 4-manifold and S its scalar curvature, then the relation |W_+|^2 = S^2/6 is well-known. For any almost K\"ahler 4-manifold with S \ge 0, this condition forces the K\"ahler property. A compact almost K\"ahler 4-manifold is already K\"ahler if it satisfies the conditions | W_+ |^2 = S^2/6 and \delta W_+=0 and also if it is Einstein and | W_+| is constant. Some further results of this type are proved. An almost Hermitian 4-manifold (M,g,J) with \mathrm{supp} (W_+)=M is already K\"ahler if it satisfies the condition | W_+ |^2 = 3 (S_{\star} - S/3)^2 /8 together with |\nabla W_+ | = | \nabla |W_+|| or with \delta W_+ + \nabla \log | W_+ | \lrcorner W_+ =0, respectively. The almost complex structure J enters here explicitely via the star scalar curvature S_{\star} only.
