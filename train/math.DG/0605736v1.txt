We study pseudoholomorphic curves in the nearly Kalher \mathbf{CP}^3. It is shown that a class of curves called null-torsion are in one to one correspondence with the integrals of a holomorphic contact system on the usual Kahler \mathbb{CP}^3 studied by Bryant. Browing Bryant's result we get plenty of such curves. Rational curves are shown to be either vertical or horizontal or null-torsion. Both horizontal and null-torsion curves can be understood by mentioned Bryant's results while vertical curves are just fibers of the twistor fibration.
