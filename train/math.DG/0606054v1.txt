We prove that any Kaehler manifold admitting a flat complex conformal connection is a Bochner-Kaehler manifold with special scalar distribution and zero geometric constants. Applying the local structural theorem for such manifolds we obtain a complete description of the Kaehler manifolds under consideration.
