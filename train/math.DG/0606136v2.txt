A contact manifold M can be defined as a quotient of a symplectic manifold X by a proper, free action of \R^{>0}, with the symplectic form homogeneous of degree 2. If X is, in addition, Kaehler, and its metric is also homogeneous of degree 2, M is called Sasakian. A Sasakian manifold is realized naturally as a level set of a Kaehler potential on a complex manifold, hence it is equipped with a pseudoconvex CR-structure. We show that any Sasakian manifold M is CR-diffeomorphic to an S^1-bundle of unit vectors in a positive line bundle on a projective K\"ahler orbifold. This induces an embedding from M to an algebraic cone C. We show that this embedding is uniquely defined by the CR-structure. Additionally, we classify the Sasakian metrics on an odd-dimensional sphere equipped with a standard CR-structure.
