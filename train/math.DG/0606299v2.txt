We study the Gauss map of minimal surfaces in the Heisenberg group \mathrm{Nil}_3 endowed with a left-invariant Riemannian metric. We prove that the Gauss map of a nowhere vertical minimal surface is harmonic into the hyperbolic plane \mathbb{H}^2. Conversely, any nowhere antiholomorphic harmonic map into \mathbb{H}^2 is the Gauss map of a nowhere vertical minimal surface. Finally, we study the image of the Gauss map of complete nowhere vertical minimal surfaces.
