Laguerre geometry of surfaces in \R^3 is given in the book of Blaschke [1], and have been studied by E.Musso and L.Nicolodi [5], [6], [7], B. Palmer [8] and other authors. In this paper we study Laguerre differential geometry of hypersurfaces in \R^n. For any umbilical free hypersurface x: M\to\R^n with non-zero principal curvatures we define a Laguerre invariant metric g on M and a Laguerre invariant self-adjoint operator {\mathbb S}: TM\to TM, and show that \{g,{\mathbb S}\} is a complete Laguerre invariant system for hypersurfaces in \R^n with n\ge 4. We calculate the Euler-Lagrange equation for the Laguerre volume functional of Laguerre metric by using Laguerre invariants. Using the Euclidean space \R^n, the Lorentzian space \R^n_1 and the degenerate space \R^n_0 we define three Laguerre space forms U\R^n, U\R^n_1 and U\R^n_0 and define the Laguerre embedding  U\R^n_1\to U\R^n and U\R^n_0\to U\R^n, analogue to the Moebius geometry where we have Moebius space forms S^n, \H^n and \R^n (spaces of constant curvature) and conformal embedding \H^n\to S^n and \R^n\to S^n (cf. [4], [10]). Using these Laguerre embedding we can unify the Laguerre geometry of hypersurfaces in \R^n, \R^n_1 and \R^n_0. As an example we show that minimal surfaces in \R^3_1 or \R_0^3 are Laguerre minimal in \R^3.
