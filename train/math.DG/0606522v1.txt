In [8], P. Lecomte conjectured the existence of a natural and projectively equivariant quantization. In [1], M. Bordemann proved this existence using the framework of Thomas-Whitehead connections. In [9], we gave a new proof of the same theorem thanks to the Cartan connections. After these works there was no explicit formula for the quantization. In this paper, we give this formula using the formula in terms of Cartan connections given in [9]. This explicit formula constitutes the generalization to any order of the formulae at second and third orders soon published by Bouarroudj in [2] and [3].
