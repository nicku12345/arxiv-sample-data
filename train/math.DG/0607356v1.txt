In this short note, as a simple application of the strong result proved recently by B\"ohm and Wilking, we give a classification on closed manifolds with 2-nonnegative curvature operator. Moreover, by the new invariant cone constructions of B\"ohm and Wilking, we show that any complete Riemannian manifold (with dimension \ge 3) whose curvature operator is bounded and satisfies the pinching condition R\ge \delta R_{I}>0, for some \delta>0, must be compact. This provides an intrinsic analogue of a result of Hamilton on convex hypersurfaces.
