In this paper we study surfaces in Euclidean 3-space that satisfy a Weingarten condition of linear type as \kappa_1=m \kappa_2 +n, where m and n are real numbers and \kappa_1 and \kappa_2 denote the principal curvatures at each point of the surface. We investigate the possible existence of such surfaces parametrized by a uniparametric family of circles. Besides the surfaces of revolution, we prove that not exist more except the case (m,n)=(-1,0), that is, if the surface is one of the classical examples of minimal surfaces discovered by Riemann.
