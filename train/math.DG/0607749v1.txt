In this paper we study surfaces in Euclidean 3-space foliated by pieces of circles and that satisfy a Weingarten condition of type a H+b K=c, where a,b and c are constant and H and K denote the mean curvature and the Gauss curvature respectively. We prove that a such surface must be a surface of revolution, a Riemann minimal surface or a generalized cone.
