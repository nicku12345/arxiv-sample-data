We study Willmore surfaces of constant Moebius curvature K in S^4. It is proved that such a surface in S^3 must be part of a minimal surface in R^3 or the Clifford torus. Another result in this paper is that an isotropic surface (hence also Willmore) in S^4 of constant K could only be part of a complex curve in C^2\cong R^4 or the Veronese 2-sphere in S^4. It is conjectured that they are the only examples possible. The main ingredients of the proofs are over-determined systems and isoparametric functions.
