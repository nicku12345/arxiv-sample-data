We give a new construction of Einstein and Kaehler-Einstein manifolds which are asymptotically complex hyperbolic, inspired by the work of Mazzeo-Pacard in the real hyperbolic case. The idea is to develop a gluing theorem for 1-handle surgery at infinity, which generalizes the Klein construction for the complex hyperbolic metric.
