On a n-dimensional connected compact manifold with non-empty boundary equipped with a Riemannian metric, a spin structure and a chirality operator, we study some properties of a spin conformal invariant defined from the first eigenvalue of the Dirac operator under the chiral bag boundary condition. More precisely, we show that we can derive a spinorial analogue of Aubin's inequality.
