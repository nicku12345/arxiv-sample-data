We construct a compact example of 7- dimensional manifold endowed with a weakly integrable generalized G_2-structure with respect to a closed and non trivial 3-form. Moreover, we investigate which type of SU(3)-structures on a 6-dimensional manifold N give rise to a strongly integrable generalized G_2-structure with respect to a non trivial 3-form on the product N \times S^1.
