We classify flat strict nearly K\"ahler manifolds with (necessarily) indefinite metric. Any such manifold is locally the product of a flat pseudo-K\"ahler factor of maximal dimension and a strict flat nearly K\"ahler manifold of split signature (2m,2m) with m\ge 3. Moreover, the geometry of the second factor is encoded in a complex three-form \zeta \in \Lambda^3 (\mathbb{C}^m)^*. The first nontrivial example occurs in dimension 4m=12.
