In this paper we aim for a generalisation of the Steenrod Approximation Theorem from, concerning a smoothing procedure for sections in smooth locally trivial bundles. The generalisation is that we consider locally trivial smooth bundles with a possibly infinite-dimensional typical fibre. The main result states that a continuous section in a smooth locally trivial bundles can always be smoothed out in a very controlled way (in terms of the graph topology on spaces of continuous functions), preserving the section on regions where it is already smooth.
