Rugang Ye proved the existence of a family of constant mean curvature hypersurfaces in an m+1-dimensional Riemannian manifold (M^{m+1},g), which concentrate at a point p_0 (which is required to be a nondegenerate critical point of the scalar curvature), moreover he proved that this family constitute a foliation of a neighborhood of p_0. In this paper we extend this result to the other curvatures (the r-th mean curvature for 1\le r\le m).
