We give an elaborated treatment of discrete isothermic surfaces and their analogs in different geometries (projective, M\"obius, Laguerre, Lie). We find the core of the theory to be a novel projective characterization of discrete isothermic nets as Moutard nets. The latter belong to projective geometry and are nets with planar faces defined through a five-point property: a vertex and its four diagonal neighbors span a three dimensional space. Analytically this property is equivalent to the existence of representatives in the space of homogeneous coordinates satisfying the discrete Moutard equation. Restricting the projective theory to quadrics, we obtain Moutard nets in sphere geometries. In particular, Moutard nets in M\"obius geometry are shown to coincide with discrete isothermic nets. The five-point property in this particular case says that a vertex and its four diagonal neighbors lie on a common sphere, which is a novel characterization of discrete isothermic surfaces. Discrete Laguerre isothermic surfaces are defined through the corresponding five-plane property which requires that a plane and its four diagonal neighbors share a common touching sphere. Equivalently, Laguerre isothermic surfaces are characterized by having an isothermic Gauss map. We conclude with Moutard nets in Lie geometry.
