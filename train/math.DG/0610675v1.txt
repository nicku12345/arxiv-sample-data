In this paper, we study the nilradicals of parabolic subalgebras of semisimple Lie algebras and the natural one-dimensional solvable extensions of them. We investigate the structures, curvatures and Einstein conditions of the associated nilmanifolds and solvmanifolds. We show that our solvmanifold is Einstein if the nilradical is of two-step. New examples of Einstein solvmanifolds with three-step and four-step nilradicals are also given.
