We prove an existence result for local and global G-structure preserving affine immersions between affine manifolds. Several examples are discussed in the context of Riemannian and semi-Riemannian geometry, including the case of isometric immersions into Lie groups endowed with a left-invariant metric, and the case of isometric immersions into products of space forms.
