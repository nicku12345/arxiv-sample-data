Given two univalent harmonic mappings f_1 and f_2 on \mathbb{D}, which lift to minimal surfaces via the Weierstrass-Enneper representation theorem, we give necessary and sufficient conditions for f_3=(1-s)f_1+sf_2 to lift to a minimal surface for s\in[0,1]. We then construct such mappings from Enneper's surface to Scherk's singularly periodic surface, Sckerk's doubly periodic surface to the catenoid, and the 4-Enneper surface to the 4-noid.
