It was shown by Samelson and Wang that each compact Lie group K of even dimension admits left-invariant complex structures. When K has odd dimension it admits a left-invariant CR-structure of maximal dimension. This has been proved recently by Charbonnel and Khalgui who have also given a complete algebraic description of these structures. In this article we present an alternative and more geometric construction of this type of invariant structures on a compact Lie group K when it is semisimple. We prove that each left-invariant complex structure, or each CR-structure of maximal dimension with a transverse CR-action by R, is induced by a holomorphic C^l action on a quasi-projective manifold X naturally associated to K. We then show that X admits more general Abelian actions, also inducing complex or CR structures on K which are generically non-invariant.
