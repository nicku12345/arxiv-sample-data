In this paper we introduce the fourth fundamental form for the hypersurfaces in H^{n+1} and the space-like hypersurfaces in S_{1}^{n+1} and discuss the conformality of the normal Gauss maps of the hypersurfaces in H^{n+1} and S_{1}^{n+1}. Particularly, we discuss the surfaces with conformal normal Gauss maps in H^{3} and S_{1}^{3} and prove a duality property. We give the Weierstrass representation formula for the space-like surfaces in S_{1}^{3} with conformal normal Gauss maps. We also state the similar results for the time-like surfaces in S_{1}^{3}.
