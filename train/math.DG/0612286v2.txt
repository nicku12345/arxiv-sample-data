New examples of harmonic unit vector fields on hyperbolic 3-space are constructed by exploiting the reduction of symmetry arising from the foliation by horospheres. This is compared and contrasted with the analogous construction in Euclidean 3-space, using a foliation by planes, which produces some new examples of harmonic maps from 3-dimensional Euclidean domains to the 2-sphere. Finally, the harmonic unit vector field tangent to a parallel family of hyperbolic geodesics is shown to be unstable, by constructing a class of compactly supported energy-decreasing variations. All examples considered have infinite total bending.
