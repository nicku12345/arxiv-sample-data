In this paper, we study biharmonic maps into Sol and Nil spaces, two model spaces of Thurston's 3-dimensional geometries. We characterize non-geodesic biharmonic curves in Sol space and prove that there exists no non-geodesic biharmonic helix in Sol space. We also show that a linear map from a Euclidean space into Sol or Nil space is biharmonic if and only if it is a harmonic map, and give a complete classification of such maps.
