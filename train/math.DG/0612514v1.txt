In this lecture delivered at the Integrable and Quantum Field Theory at Peyresq sixth meeting, we review the Lychagin's Monge-Ampere operators theory and exhibit the link it establishes between the classical problem of local equivalence for non linear partial differential equations and the problem of integrability of some geometrical structures.
