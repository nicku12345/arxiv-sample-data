Minimal isometric immersions F in codimension two from a complete Kahler manifold into Euclidean space had been classified for dimension greater than or equal to 3. In this note we describe the non--minimal situation by showing that, if F is real analytic but not everywhere minimal, then F is a cylinder over a real Kahler surface G in Euclidean 6-space. In addition, G can be further described.
