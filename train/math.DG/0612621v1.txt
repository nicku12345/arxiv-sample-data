We prove a modified version of Turbiner's conjecture in three dimensions and we give a counter-example to the original conjecture. The Lie algebraic Schr\"odinger operators corresponding to flat metrics of a certain restricted type are shown to separate partially in either Cartesian, cylindrical or spherical coordinates.
