We classify six-dimensional homogeneous nearly K\"{a}hler manifolds and give a positive answer to Gray and Wolf's conjecture: every homogeneous nearly K\"{a}hler manifold is a Riemannian 3-symmetric space equipped with its canonical almost Hermitian structure. The only four examples in dimension 6 are S^3 \times S^3, the complex projective space \CM P^3, the flag manifold \mathbb F^3 and the sphere S^6. We develop, about each of these spaces, a distinct aspect of nearly K\"{a}hler geometry and make in the same time a sharp description of its specific homogeneous structure.
