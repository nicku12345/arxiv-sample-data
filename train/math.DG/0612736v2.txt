These are expanded notes of a course given in Grenoble in june 2004. After a brief description of the harmonic map proof of Margulis' superrigidity and arithmeticity theorems, it is shown how the method might generalize to fundamental groups of simplicial complexes whose links have large enough nonlinear spectral gaps, with emphasis on random groups.
