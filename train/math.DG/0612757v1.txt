This paper continues the study of a class of compact convex hypersurfaces in Euclidean space R^{n+1}, ~n \geq 1, which are boundaries of compact convex bodies obtained by taking the intersection of (solid) confocal paraboloids of revolution. Such hypersurfaces are called reflectors. In R^3 reflectors arise naturally in geometrical optics and are used in design of light reflectors and reflector antennas. They are also important in rendering problems in computer graphics.   The notion of a focal function for reflectors plays a central role similar to that of the Minkowski support function for convex bodies. In this paper the basic question of when a given function is a focal function of a convex reflector is answered by establishing necessary and sufficient conditions. In addition, some smoothness properties of reflectors and of the associated directrix hypersurfaces are also etablished.
