The generalized Weierstrass representation is used to analyze the asymptotic behavior of a constant mean curvature surface that arises locally from an ordinary differential equation with a regular singularity.   We prove that a holomorphic perturbation of an ODE that represents a Delaunay surface generates a constant mean curvature surface which has a properly immersed end that is asymptotically Delaunay. Furthermore, that end is embedded if the Delaunay surface is unduloidal.
