We consider four-dimensional Riemannian manifolds with commuting higher order Jacobi operators defined on two-dimensional orthogonal subspaces (polygons) and on their orthogonal subspaces.   More precisely, we discuss higher order Jacobi operator \mathcal{J}(X) and its commuting associated operator \mathcal{J}(X^{\perp}) induced by the orthogonal complement X^{\perp} of the vector X, i. e. \mathcal{J}(X)\circ\mathcal{J}(X^{\perp})=\mathcal{J}(X^{\perp})\circ \mathcal{J}(X).   At the end some new central theorems have been cited. The latter are due to P. Gilkey, E. Puffini and V. Videv, and have been recently obtained.
