We study complete minimal graphs in HxR, which take asymptotic boundary values plus and minus infinity on alternating sides of an ideal inscribed polygon &#915; in H. We give necessary and sufficient conditions on the "lenghts" of the sides of the polygon (and all inscribed polygons in &#915;) that ensure the existence of such a graph. We then apply this to construct entire minimal graphs in HxR that are conformally the complex plane C. The vertical projection of such a graph yields a harmonic diffeomorphism from C onto H, disproving a conjecture of Rick Schoen.
