We investigate the submanifold geometry of the orbits of Hermann actions on Riemannian symmetric spaces. After proving that the curvature and shape operators of these orbits commute, we calculate the eigenvalues of the shape operators in terms of the restricted roots. As applications, we get a formula for the volumes of the orbits and a new proof of a Weyl-type integration formula for Hermann actions.
