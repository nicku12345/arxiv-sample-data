In this paper, we study certain compact 4-manifolds with non-negative sectional curvature K. If s is the scalar curvature and W_+ is the self-dual part of Weyl tensor, then it will be shown that there is no metric g on S^2 \times S^2 with both (i) K > 0 and (ii)  {1/6} s - W_+ \ge 0.   We also investigate other aspects of 4-manifolds with non-negative sectional curvature. One of our results implies a theorem of Hamilton: ``If a simply-connected, closed 4-manifold M^4 admits a metric g of non-negative curvature operator, then M^4 is one of S^4, \Bbb CP^2 and S^2 \times S^2".   Our method is different from Hamilton's and is much simpler. A new version of the second variational formula for minimal surfaces in 4-manifolds is proved.
