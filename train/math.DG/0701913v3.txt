We produce skew loops -- loops having no pair of parallel tangent lines -- homotopic to any loop in a flat torus or other quotient of R^n. The interesting case here is n=3. More subtly for any n, we characterize the homotopy classes that will contain a skew loop having a specified loop in the unit sphere as tangent indicatrix.
