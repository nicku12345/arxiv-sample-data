In this article we give a geometric interpretation of the Hitchin component for PSL(4,R) in the representation variety of a closed oriented surface of higher genus. We show that representations in the Hitchin component are precisely the holonomy representations of properly convex foliated projective structures on the unit tangent bundle of the surface. From this we also deduce a geometric description of the Hitchin component the symplectic group PSp(4,R).
