We construct a K\"ahler structure ({\mathbb{J}},\Omega,{\mathbb{G}}) on the space {\mathbb{L}}({\mathbb{H}}^3) of oriented geodesics of hyperbolic 3-space {\mathbb{H}}^3 and investigate its properties. We prove that ({\mathbb{L}}({\mathbb{H}}^3),{\mathbb{J}}) is biholomorphic to {\mathbb{P}}^1\times{\mathbb{P}}^1-\bar{\Delta}, where \bar{\Delta} is the reflected diagonal, and that the K\"ahler metric {\mathbb{G}} is of neutral signature, conformally flat and scalar flat. We establish that the identity component of the isometry group of the metric {\mathbb{G}} on {\mathbb{L}}({\mathbb{H}}^3) is isomorphic to the identity component of the hyperbolic isometry group. Finally, we show that the geodesics of {\mathbb{G}} correspond to ruled minimal surfaces in {\mathbb{H}}^3, which are totally geodesic iff the geodesics are null.
