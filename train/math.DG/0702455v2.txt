It is well-known that every 6-dimensional strictly nearly K\"{a}hler manifold (M,g,J) is Einstein with positive scalar curvature scal>0. Moreover, one can show that the space E of co-closed primitive (1,1)-forms on M is stable under the Laplace operator \Delta. Let E(a) denote the a-eigenspace of the restriction of \Delta to E. If M is compact, we prove that the moduli space of infinitesimal Einstein deformations of the nearly K\"{a}hler metric g is naturally isomorphic to the direct sum E(scal/15)\oplus E(scal/5)\oplus E(2scal/5). It is known that the last summand is itself isomorphic with the moduli space of infinitesimal nearly K\"{a}hler deformations.
