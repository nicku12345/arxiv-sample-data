It is shown that in every dimension n=3j+2, j=1,2,3,..., there exist compact pseudo-Riemannian manifolds with parallel Weyl tensor, which are Ricci-recurrent, but neither conformally flat nor locally symmetric, and represent all indefinite metric signatures. The manifolds in question are diffeomorphic to nontrivial torus bundles over the circle. They all arise from a construction that a priori yields bundles over the circle, having as the fibre either a torus, or a 2-step nilmanifold with a complete flat torsionfree connection; our argument only realizes the torus case.
