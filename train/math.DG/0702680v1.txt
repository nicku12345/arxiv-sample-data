Let G, a subset of O(4), act isometrically on the 3-sphere. In this article we calculate a lower bound for the diameter of the quotient spaces S^3/G. We find it to be {1/2}\arccos(\frac{\tan(\frac{3 \pi}{10})}{\sqrt3}), which is exactly the value of the lower bound for diameters of the spherical space forms. In the process, we are also able to find a lower bound for diameters for the spherical Aleksandrov spaces, S^n/G, of cohomogeneities 1 and 2, as well as for cohomogeneity 3 (with some restrictions on the group type). This leads us to conjecture that the diameter of S^n/G is increasing as the cohomogeneity of the group G increases.
