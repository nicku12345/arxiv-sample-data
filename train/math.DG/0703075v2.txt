Let C be a hyperelliptic Riemann surface. We show that the hyperelliptic Weierstrass points of C are non-degenerated critical points of Morse index +2 of the curvature function K of the Theta metric on C (called also Bergman metric). When the genus of C is two, we compute all critical points of K and we show in this case that K is a Morse function.
