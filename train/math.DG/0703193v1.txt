The characteristic connection of an almost hermitian structure is a hermitian connection with totally skew-symmetric torsion. The case of parallel torsion in dimension six is of particular interest. In this work, we give a full classification of the algebraic types of the torsion form, and, based on this, undertake a systematic investigation into the possible geometries. Numerous naturally reductive spaces are constructed and classified as well as examples on nilmanifolds given.
