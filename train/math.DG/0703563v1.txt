We study the equation \Delta_g u -\frac{n-2}{4(n-1)}R(g)u+Ku^p=0 (1+\zeta \leq p \leq \frac{n+2}{n-2}) on locally conformally flat compact manifolds (M^n,g). We prove the following: (i) When the scalar curvature R(g)>0 and the dimension n \geq 4, under suitable conditions on K, all positive solutions u have uniform upper and lower bounds; (ii) When the scalar curvature R(g)\equiv 0 and n \geq 5, under suitable conditions on K, all positive solutions u with bounded energy have uniform upper and lower bounds. We also give an example to show that the energy bound condition for the uniform estimates in math.DG/0602636 is necessary.
