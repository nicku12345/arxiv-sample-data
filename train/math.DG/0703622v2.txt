In this paper, we study trigonal minimal surfaces in flat tori. First, we show a topological obstruction similar to that of hyperelliptic minimal surfaces. Actually, the genus of trigonal minimal surface in 3-dimensional flat torus must be 1 (mod 3). Next, we construct an explicit example in the higher codimensional case. This surface satisfies good properties and is theoretically distinct from traditional examples.
