The aim of this thesis is to construct new examples of compact orbifolds \mathcal{O}^4(\Theta) which admit a self dual Einstein (SDE) metric of positive scalar curvature s>0, with a one-dimensional group of isometries. In particular we want to prove that these examples are different from those described by Boyer, Galicki and Piccinni in \emph{3-Sasakian geometry, nilpotents orbits, and exeptional quotients}. We construct explicitly our new examples as quaternion-K\ddot{\mathrm{a}}hler reductions of the quaternion K\ddot{\mathrm{a}}hler Grassmannian Gr_4(\mathbb{R}^8) by an isometric action of a 3-torus T^3_{\Theta}\subset T^4\subset SO(8) \subset Sp(8) on the sphere S^{31}\subset \mathbb{H}^8, where \Theta is an interger 3\times 4 weight matrix.
