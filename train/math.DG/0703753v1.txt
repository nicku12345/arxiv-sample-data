Let \mathcal F be a Lie foliation on a closed manifold M with structural Lie group G. Its transverse Lie structure can be considered as a transverse action \Phi of G on (M,\mathcal F); i.e., an ``action'' which is defined up to leafwise homotopies. This \Phi induces an action \Phi^* of G on the reduced leafwise cohomology \bar H(\mathcal F). By using leafwise Hodge theory, the supertrace of \Phi^* can be defined as a distribution L_{dis}(\mathcal F) on G called the Lefschetz distribution of \mathcal F. A distributional version of the Gauss-Bonett theorem is proved, which describes L_{dis}(\mathcal F) around the identity element. On any small enough open subset of G, L_{dis}(\mathcal F) is described by a distributional version of the Lefschetz trace formula.
