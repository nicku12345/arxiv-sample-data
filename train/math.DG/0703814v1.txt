In this paper we review some author's results about singular holonomy of singular riemannian foliations with sections (s.r.f.s for short) and also some results of a joint work with Toeben and a joint work with Gorodski. We stress here that the condition that the leaves are compact, used in some of these results, can be replaced by the condition that the leaves are closed embedded. We also briefly recall some of Toeben's results about blow-up of s.r.f.s. Then we use this technique to get conditions under which a holonomy map can be extended to a global isometry.
