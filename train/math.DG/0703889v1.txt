We give a very short and rather elementary proof of Gromov's filling volume inequality for n-dimensional Lipschitz cycles (with integer and Z_2-coefficients) in L^\infty-spaces. This inequality is used in the proof of Gromov's systolic inequality for closed aspherical Riemannian manifolds and is often regarded as the difficult step therein.
