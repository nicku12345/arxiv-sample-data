For the ``Hopf bundle'' S^1\to S^{2n,1} \to {\mathbb H}^n, horizontal lifts of simple closed curves are studied. Let \gamma be a piecewise smooth, simple closed curve on a complete totally geodesic surface S in the base space. Then the holonomy displacement along \gamma is given by  V(\gamma)=e^{\lambda A(\gamma) i}  where A(\gamma) is the area of the region on the surface S surrounded by \gamma; \lambda=1/2  or 0 depending on whether S is a complex submanifold or not. We also carry out a similar investigation for the complex Heisenberg group {\mathbb R} \to {\mathcal H}^{2n+1} \to {\mathbb C}^n.
