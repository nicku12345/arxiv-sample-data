We prove curvature estimates for general curvature functions. As an application we show the existence of closed, strictly convex hypersurfaces with prescribed curvature F, where the defining cone of F is \C_+. F is only assumed to be monotone, symmetric, homogeneous of degree 1, concave and of class C^{m,\al}, m\ge4.
