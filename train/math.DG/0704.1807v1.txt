Given an isometric immersion f\colon M^n\to \R^{n+1} of a compact Riemannian manifold of dimension n\geq 3 into Euclidean space of dimension n+1, we prove that the identity component Iso^0(M^n) of the isometry group Iso(M^n) of M^n admits an orthogonal representation \Phi\colon Iso^0(M^n)\to SO(n+1) such that f\circ g=\Phi(g)\circ f for every g\in Iso^0(M^n). If G is a closed connected subgroup of Iso(M^n) acting locally polarly on M^n, we prove that \Phi(G) acts polarly on \R^{n+1}, and we obtain that f(M^n) is given as \Phi(G)(L), where L is a hypersurface of a section which is invariant under the Weyl group of the \Phi(G)-action. We also find several sufficient conditions for such an f to be a rotation hypersurface. Finally, we show that compact Euclidean rotation hypersurfaces of dimension n\geq 3 are characterized by their underlying warped product structure.
