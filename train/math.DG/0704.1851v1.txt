Let M^{4n} be a complete quaternionic K\"ahler manifold with scalar curvature bounded below by -16n(n+2). We get a sharp estimate for the first eigenvalue \lambda_1(M) of the Laplacian which is \lambda_1(M)\le (2n+1)^2. If the equality holds, then either M has only one end, or M is diffeomorphic to \mathbb{R}\times N with N given by a compact manifold. Moreover, if M is of bounded curvature, M is covered by the quaterionic hyperbolic space \mathbb{QH}^n and N is a compact quotient of the generalized Heisenberg group. When \lambda_1(M)\ge \frac{8(n+2)}3, we also prove that M must have only one end with infinite volume.
