The \pi-exterior derivative {\o}d, which is the Finslerian generalization of the (usual) exterior derivative d of Riemannian geometry, is defined. The notion of a {\o}d-closed vector field is introduced and investigated. Various characterizations of {\o}d-closed vector fields are established. Some results concerning {\o}d-closed vector fields in relation to certain special Finsler spaces are obtained.
