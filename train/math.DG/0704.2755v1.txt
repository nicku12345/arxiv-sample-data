We study parabolic linear Weingarten surfaces in hyperbolic space \rlopezh^3. In particular, we classify two family of parabolic surfaces: surfaces with constant Gaussian curvature and surfaces that satisfy the relation a\kappa_1+b\kappa_2=c, where \kappa_i are the principal curvatures, and a,b and c are constant.
