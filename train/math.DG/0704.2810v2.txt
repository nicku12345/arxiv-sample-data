Let M^2 be an oriented 2-manifold and f:M^2\to R^3 a C^\infty-map. A point p\in M^2 is called a singular point if f is not an immersion at p. The map f is called a front (or wave front), if there exists a unit C^\infty-vector field \nu such that the image of each tangent vector df(X) (X\in TM^2) is perpendicular to \nu, and the pair (f,\nu) gives an immersion into R^3\times S^2. In our previous paper, we gave an intrinsic formulation of wave fronts in R^3. In this paper, we shall investigate the behavior of cuspidal edges near corank one singular points and establish Gauss-Bonnet-type formulas under the intrinsic formulation.
