This paper introduces \anabla-tensors on lightlike hypersurfaces M^{n+1} of signature (0,n), (n\geq 1) and investigates on their properties in connection with the null geometry of M. In particular, we show that there is an interplay between existence of \anabla-tensors of certain type and lightlike warped product structures.
