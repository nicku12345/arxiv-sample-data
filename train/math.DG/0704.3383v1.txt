We study Weyl structures on lightlikes hypersurfaces endowed with a conformal structure of certain type and specific screen distribution: the Weyl screen structures. We investigate various differential geometric properties of Einstein-Weyl screen structures on lightlike hypersurfaces and show that, for ambiant Lorentzian space \mathbb{R}^{n+2}_{1} and a totally umbilical screen foliation, there is a strong interplay with the induced (Riemannian) Weyl-structure on the leaves. Finally, we establish necessary and sufficient conditions for a Weyl structure defined by the 1-form of an almost contact structure given by an additional complex structure in case of an ambiant Kaehler manifold to be closed.
