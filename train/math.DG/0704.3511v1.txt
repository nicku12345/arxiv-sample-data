We study the transverse Lusternik-Schnirelmann category of a Riemannian foliation on a compact manifold. We obtain a necessary and sufficient condition when the transverse LS category is finite. We also introduce a variation on the concept of transverse LS category, the essential transverse category, and show that this is finite for every Riemannian foliation and coincides with the transverse category if the latter is finite. Moreover we prove that the essential transverse category is a lower bound for the number of critical leaf closures of a basic differentiable function on M.
