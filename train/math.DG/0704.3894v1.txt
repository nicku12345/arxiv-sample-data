In this note we give a direct method to classify all stable forms on \R^n as well as to determine their automorphism groups. We show that in dimension 6,7,8 stable forms coincide with non-degnerate forms.   We present necessary conditions and sufficient conditions for a manifold to admit a stable form. We also discuss rich properties of the geometry of such manifolds.
