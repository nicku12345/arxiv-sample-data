For Riemannian manifolds with a measure (M,g, e^{-f} dvol_g) we prove mean curvature and volume comparison results when the \infty-Bakry-Emery Ricci tensor is bounded from below and f is bounded or \partial_r f is bounded from below, generalizing the classical ones (i.e. when f is constant). This leads to extensions of many theorems for Ricci curvature bounded below to the Bakry-Emery Ricci tensor. In particular, we give extensions of all of the major comparison theorems when f is bounded. Simple examples show the bound on f is necessary for these results.
