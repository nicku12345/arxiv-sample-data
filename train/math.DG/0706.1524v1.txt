Inspired by a Blaschke's work about analytic convex surfaces, we study {\em shadow boundaries} of Riemannian submanifolds M, which are defined by a parallel vector field along M. Since a shadow boundary is just a closed subset of M, first, we will give a condition that guarantee its smoothness. It depends on the second fundamental form of the submanifold. It is natural to search for what kind of properties might have such submanifolds of M? Could they be totally geodesic or minimal? Answers to these and related questions are given in this work.
