The aim of this research is the study of Gray curvature identities, introduced by Alfred Gray in \cite{kn:Gra76} for the class of almost hermitian manifolds. As known till now, there is no equivalent for the class of almost contact manifolds. For this purpose we use the Boohby-Wang fibration and the warped manifolds construction in order to establish which identities could be satisfied by an almost contact manifold.
