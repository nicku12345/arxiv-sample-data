Recall that a submanifold of a Riemannian manifold is said to be minimal if its mean curvature is zero. It is classical that minimal submanifolds are the critical points of the volume function. In this paper, we examine the critical points of the total (2k)-th Gauss-Bonnet curvature function, called (2k)-minimal submanifolds. We prove that they are characterized by the vanishing of a higher mean curvature, namely the (2k+1)-Gauss-Bonnet curvature. Furthermore, we show that several properties of usual minimal submanifolds can be naturally generalized to (2k)-minimal submanifolds.
