We give a spinorial characterization of isometrically immersed surfaces into 3-dimensional homogeneous manifolds with 4-dimensional isometry group in terms of the existence of a particular spinor, called generalized Killing spinor. This generalizes results by T. Friedrich for \R^3 and B. Morel for \Ss^3 and \HH^3. The main argument is the interpretation of the energy-momentum tensor of a genralized Killing spinor as the second fondamental form up to a tensor depending on the structure of the ambient space
