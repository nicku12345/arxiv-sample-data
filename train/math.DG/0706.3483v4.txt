We characterize the standard \mathbb{S}^3 as the closed Ricci-positive 3-manifold with scalar curvature at least 6 having isoperimetric surfaces of largest area: 4\pi. As a corollary we answer in the affirmative an interesting special case of a conjecture of Min-Oo's on the scalar curvature rigidity of the upper hemisphere..
