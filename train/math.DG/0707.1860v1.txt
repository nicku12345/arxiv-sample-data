In 1963, K.P.Grotemeyer proved an interesting variant of the Gauss-Bonnet Theorem. Let M be an oriented closed surface in the Euclidean space R^3 with Euler characteristic \chi(M), Gauss curvature G and unit normal vector field n. Grotemeyer's identity replaces the Gauss-Bonnet integrand G by the normal moment <a,n>^2G, where a is a fixed unit vector. Grotemeyer showed that the total integral of this integrand is (2/3)pi times chi(M).   We generalize Grotemeyer's result to oriented closed even-dimesional hypersurfaces of dimension n in an (n+1) ndimensional space form N^{n+1}(k).
