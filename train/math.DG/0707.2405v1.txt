In these lecture notes, we give a quick account of the theory of Poisson groupoids and Lie bialgebroids. In particular, we discuss the universal lifting theorem and its applications including integration of quasi-Lie bialgebroids, integration of Poisson Nijenhuis structures and Alekseev and Kosmann-Schwarzbach's theory of D/G-momentum maps.
