We construct a geometric structure on deformed supermanifolds as a certain subalgebra of the vector fields. In the classical limit we obtain a decoupling of the infinitesimal odd and even transformations, whereas in the semiclassical limit the result is a representation of the supersymmetry algebra. In the case of mass preserving structure we describe all high energy corrections to this algebra.
