We prove that if (M^n,g), n \ge 4, is a compact, orientable, locally irreducible Riemannian manifold with nonnegative isotropic curvature, then one of the following possibilities hold:   (i) M admits a metric with positive isotropic curvature   (ii) (M,g) is isometric to a locally symmetric space   (iii) (M,g) is K\"ahler and biholomorphic to \C P^\frac {n}{2}.   (iv) (M,g) is quaternionic-K\"ahler.   This is implied by the following result:   Let (M^{2n},g) be a compact, locally irreducible K\"ahler manifold with nonnegative isotropic curvature. Then either M is biholomorphic to \C P^n or isometric to a compact Hermitian symmetric space. This answers a question of Micallef and Wang in the affirmative.   The proof is based on the recent work of S. Brendle and R. Schoen on the Ricci flow.
