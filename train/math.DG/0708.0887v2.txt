In an ambient space with rotational symmetry around an axis (which include the Hyperbolic and Euclidean spaces), we study the evolution under the volume-preserving mean curvature flow of a revolution hypersurface M generated by a graph over the axis of revolution and with boundary in two totally geodesic hypersurfaces (tgh for short). Requiring that, for each time t, the evolving hypersurface M_t meets such tgh ortogonally, we prove that: a) the flow exists while M_t does not touch the axis of rotation; b) throughout the time interval of existence, b1) the generating curve of M_t remains a graph, and b2) the averaged mean curvature is double side bounded by positive constants; c) the singularity set (if non-empty) is finite and discrete along the axis; d) under a suitable hypothesis relating the enclosed volume to the n-volume of M, we achieve long time existence and convergence to a revolution hypersurface of constant mean curvature.
