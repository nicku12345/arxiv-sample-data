On a manifold of dimension at least six, let (g,\tau) be a pair consisting of a K\"ahler metric g which is locally K\"ahler irreducible, and a nonconstant smooth function \tau. Off the zero set of \tau, if the metric \hat{g}=g/\tau^2 is a gradient Ricci soliton which has soliton function 1/\tau, we show that \hat{g} is K\"ahler with respect to another complex structure, and locally of a type first described by Koiso. Moreover, \tau is a special K\"ahler-Ricci potential, a notion defined in earlier works of Derdzinski and Maschler. The result extends to dimension four with additional assumptions. We also discuss a Ricci-Hessian equation, which is a generalization of the soliton equation, and observe that the set of pairs (g,\tau) satisfying a Ricci-Hessian equation is invariant, in a suitable sense, under the map (g,\tau)\to (\hat{g},1/\tau).
