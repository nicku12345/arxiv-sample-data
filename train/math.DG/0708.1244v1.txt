In this thesis, we show the existence of a sequence of differential operators starting with with the Dirac operator in k Clifford variables, D=(D_1,..., D_k), where D_i=\sum_j e_j\cdot \partial_{ij}: C^\infty((\R^n)^k,\S)\to C^\infty((\R^n)^k,\S) (\S is the spinor module). This operator is the Cauchy-Riemann operator for n=2 and its resolution is the Dolbeault complex. For higher n, the resolution of D is not known in general. While this problem was treated many times in the language of Clifford analysis and some partial results are known, we give a description of this operator in Parabolic geometry, which is a special type of Cartan geometry modeled on G/P, where P is a Parabolic subgroup of G. We construct sequences of invariant differential operators starting with the Dirac operator in several variables and assume that these sequences coinside in some cases with the resolution. We describe the structure of these sequences precisely in case the dimension n is odd and give a conjecture that these sequences have similar structure for n even, k\leq n/2 (the s.c. {\it stable range}). We also give some information about these sequences in case n even, k>n/2. In the last chapter, explicite formulas for the operators are derived for the case k=2.
