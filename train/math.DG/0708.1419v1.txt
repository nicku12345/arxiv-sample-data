A Jet groupoid R_q over a manifold X is a special Lie groupoid consisting of q-jets of local diffeomorphisms from X to X. As a subbundle of the q-th order jet bundle of the trivial bundle X times X, a jet groupoid can be considered as a nonlinear system of partial differential equations (PDE). This leads to the concept of formal integrability. On the other hand, each jet groupoid is the symmetry groupoid of a geometric object, modelled as a section of a natural bundle. Using the jet groupoids, we give a local characterisation of formal integrability for transitive jet groupoids in terms of their corresponding geometric objects.
