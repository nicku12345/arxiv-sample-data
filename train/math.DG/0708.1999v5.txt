We study the interplays between paracontact geometry and the theory of bi-Legendrian manifolds. We interpret the bi-Legendrian connection of a bi-Legendrian manifold M as the paracontact connection of a canonical paracontact structure induced on M and then we discuss many consequences of this result both for bi-Legendrian and for paracontact manifolds. Finally new classes of examples of paracontact manifolds are presented.
