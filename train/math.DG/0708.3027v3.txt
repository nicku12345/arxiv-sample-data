This paper analyses the parabolic geometries generated by a free 3-distribution in the tangent space of a manifold. It shows the existence of normal Fefferman constructions over CR and Lagrangian contact structures corresponding to holonomy reductions to SO(4,2) and SO(3,3), respectively. There is also a fascinating construction of a `dual' distribution when the holonomy reduces to G_2'. The paper concludes with some holonomy constructions for free n-distributions for n>3.
