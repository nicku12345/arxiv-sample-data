This paper concerns some stability properties of higher dimensional catenoids in \rr^{n+1} with n\ge 3. We prove that higher dimensional catenoids have index one. We use \delta-stablity for minimal hypersurfaces and show that the catenoid is \frac 2n-stable and a complete \frac 2n-stable minimal hypersurface is a catenoid or a hyperplane provided the second fundamental form satisfies some decay conditions.
