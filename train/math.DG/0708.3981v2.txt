We are interested in the spectrum of the Hodge-de Rham operator on a cyclic covering X over a compact manifold M of dimension n+1. Let \Sigma be a hypersurface in M which does not disconnect M and such that M-\Sigma is a fundamental domain of the covering. If the cohomology group H^{n/2 (\Sigma) is trivial, we can construct for each N \in \N a metric g=g_N on M, such that the Hodge-de Rham operator on the covering (X,g) has at least N gaps in its (essential) spectrum. If H^{n/2}(\Sigma) \ne 0, the same statement holds true for the Hodge-de Rham operators on p-forms provided p \notin \{n/2,n/2+1\}.
