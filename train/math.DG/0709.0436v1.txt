Let M be a real hypersurface of a complex space form with almost contact metric structure (\phi, \xi, \eta, g). In this paper, we study real hypersurfaces in a complex space form whose structure Jacobi operator R_\xi=R(\cdot,\xi)\xi is \xi-parallel. In particular, we prove that the condition \nabla_{\xi} R_{\xi}=0 characterizes the homogeneous real hypersurfaces of type A in a complex projective space or a complex hyperbolic space when R_{\xi} \phi S=S \phi R_{\xi} holds on M, where S denotes the Ricci tensor of type (1,1) on M.
