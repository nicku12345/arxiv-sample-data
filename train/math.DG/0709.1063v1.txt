We describe natural abelian extensions of the Lie algebra \aut(P) of infinitesimal automorphisms of a principal bundle over a compact manifold M and discuss their integrability to corresponding Lie group extensions. Already the case of a trivial bundle P = M \times K is quite interesting. In this case, we show that essentially all central extensions of the gauge algebra C^\infty(M,\fk) can be obtained from three fundamental types of cocycles with values in one of the spaces \fz := C^\infty(M,V), \Omega^1(M,V) and \Omega^1(M,V)/\dd C^\infty(M,V). These cocycles extend to \aut(P), and, under the assumption that TM is trivial, we also describe the space H^2({\cal V}(M),\fz) classifying the twists of these extensions. We then show that all fundamental types have natural generalizations to non-trivial bundles and explain under which conditions they extend to \aut(P) and integrate to global Lie group extensions.
