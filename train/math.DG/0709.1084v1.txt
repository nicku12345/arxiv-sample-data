Asymptotically flat manifolds with Euclidean volume growth are known to be ALE. In this paper, we consider a class of asymptotically flat manifolds with slower volume growth and prove that their asymptotic geometry is that of a fibration over an ALE manifold. In particular, we show that gravitational instantons with cubic volume growth are ALF.
