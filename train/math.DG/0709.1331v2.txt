Based on Markvorsen and Palmer's work on mean time exit and isoperimetric inequalities we establish slightly better isoperimetric inequalities and mean time exit estimates for minimal submanifolds of N\times\mathbb{R}. We also prove isoperimetric inequalities for submanifolds of Hadamard spaces with tamed second fundamental form.
