We study 2-dimensional submanifolds of the space {\mathbb{L}}({\mathbb{H}}^3) of oriented geodesics of hyperbolic 3-space, endowed with the canonical neutral K\"ahler structure. Such a surface is Lagrangian iff there exists a surface in {\mathbb{H}}^3 orthogonal to the geodesics of \Sigma.   We prove that the induced metric on a Lagrangian surface in {\mathbb{L}}({\mathbb{H}}^3) has zero Gauss curvature iff the orthogonal surfaces in {\mathbb{H}}^3 are Weingarten: the eigenvalues of the second fundamental form are functionally related. We then classify the totally null surfaces in {\mathbb{L}}({\mathbb{H}}^3) and recover the well-known holomorphic constructions of flat and CMC 1 surfaces in {\mathbb{H}}^3.
