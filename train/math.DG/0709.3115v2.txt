Cayley cones in the octonions \mathbb{O} that are ruled by oriented 2-planes are equivalent to pseudoholomorphic curves in the Grassmannian of oriented 2-planes G(2,8). The well known twistor fibration G(2,8) -> S^6 is used to prove the existence of immersed higher-genus pseudoholomorphic curves in \gro. Equivalently, this produces Cayley cones whose links are S^1-bundles over genus-g Riemann surfaces. When the degree of an immersed pseudoholomorphic curve is large enough, the corresponding 2-ruled Cayley cone is the asymptotic cone of a non-conical 2-ruled Cayley 4-fold.
