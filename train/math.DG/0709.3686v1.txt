We derive curvature estimates for minimal submanifolds in Euclidean space for arbitrary dimension and codimension via Gauss map. Thus, Schoen-Simon-Yau's results and Ecker-Huisken's results are generalized to higher codimension. In this way we improve Hildebrandt-Jost-Widman's result for the Bernstein type theorem.
