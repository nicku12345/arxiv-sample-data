We establish a link between Archimedes' method of integration for calculating areas, volumes and centers of mass of segments of parabolas and quadrics of revolution by factorization via the moments of a balance and an integration technique for a particular integrable system, namely Bianchi's B\"{a}cklund transformation for quadrics.
