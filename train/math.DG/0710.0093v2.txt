In this paper, we show the existence of a sequence of invariant differential operators on a particular homogeneous model G/P of a Cartan geometry. The first operator in this sequence can be locally identified with the Dirac operator in k Clifford variables, D=(D_1,..., D_k), where D_i=\sum_j e_j\cdot \partial_{ij}: C^\infty((\R^n)^k,\S)\to C^\infty((\R^n)^k,\S). We describe the structure of these sequences in case the dimension n is odd. It follows from the construction that all these operators are invariant with respect to the action of the group G.   These results are obtained by constructing homomorphisms of generalized Verma modules, what are purely algebraic objects.
