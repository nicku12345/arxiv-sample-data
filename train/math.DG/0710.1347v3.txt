Let M be a regular Riemann surface with a metric which has constant scalar curvature \rho. We give the asymptotic expansion of the sum of the square norm of the sections of the pluricanonical bundles K_{M}^{m}. That is, \[\sum_{i=0}^{d_{m}-1}\|S_{i}(x_{0})\|_{h_{m}}^{2} \sim m(1+\frac{\rho}{2 m})+O(e^{-\frac{(\log m)^{2}}{8}}),\] where \{S_{0},...,S_{d_{m}-1}\} is an orthonormal basis for H^{0}(M, K_{M}^{m}) for sufficiently large m.
