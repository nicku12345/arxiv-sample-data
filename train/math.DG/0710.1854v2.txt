The area distance to a convex plane curve is an important concept in computer vision. In this paper we describe a strong link between area distances and improper affine spheres. This link makes possible a better understanding of both theories. The concepts of the theory of affine spheres lead to a new definition of an area distance on the outer part of a convex plane arc. Also, based on the theory of discrete affine spheres, we propose fast algorithms to compute the area distances. On the other hand, area distances provide a good geometrical understanding of improper affine spheres.
