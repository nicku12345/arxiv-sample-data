Let \Gamma be the mapping class group of an oriented surface \Sigma of genus g with r boundary components. We prove that the first cohomology group H^1(\Gamma, O(M_{SL(2, C)})^*) is non-trivial, where the coefficient module is the dual of the space of algebraic functions on the SL(2, C) moduli space over \Sigma.
