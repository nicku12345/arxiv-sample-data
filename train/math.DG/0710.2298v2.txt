Let (M,g) be an asymptotically hyperbolic manifold with a smooth conformal compactification. We establish a general correspondence between semilinear elliptic equations of scalar curvature type on \del M and Weingarten foliations in some neighbourhood of infinity in M. We focus mostly on foliations where each leaf has constant mean curvature, though our results apply equally well to foliations where the leaves have constant \sigma_k-curvature. In particular, we prove the existence of a unique foliation near infinity in any quasi-Fuchsian 3-manifold by surfaces with constant Gauss curvature. There is a subtle interplay between the precise terms in the expansion for g and various properties of the foliation. Unlike other recent works in this area, by Rigger \cite{Ri} and Neves-Tian \cite{NT1}, \cite{NT2}, we work in the context of conformally compact spaces, which are more general than perturbations of the AdS-Schwarzschild space, but we do assume a nondegeneracy condition.
