Let M be a smooth closed 4k-manifold whose Yamabe invariant Y(M) is nonpositive. We show that Y(M\sharp l \Bbb HP^k\sharp m \bar{\Bbb HP^k})=Y(M), where l,m are nonnegative integers, and \Bbb HP^k is the quaternionic projective space. When k=4, we also have Y(M\sharp l CaP^2\sharp m \bar{CaP^2})=Y(M), where CaP^2 is the Cayley plane.
