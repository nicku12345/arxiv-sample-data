Given closed Riemannian manifold (M^n, g) of positive Ricci curvature Ricci(g) \geq (n-1)g we study isoperimetric regions on the spherical cone over M. When g is Einstein we use this to compute the Yamabe constant of (M \times {\bf R}, g + dt^2) and so to obtain lower bounds for the Yamabe invariant of M\times S^1.
