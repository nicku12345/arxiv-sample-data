Classification of curves up to affine transformation in a finite dimensional space was studied by some different methods. In this paper, we achieve the exact formulas of affine invariants via the equivalence problem and in the view of Cartan's lemma and then, state a necessary and sufficient condition for classification of n--Curves.
