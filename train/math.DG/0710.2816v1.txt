Some general Finsler connections are defined. Emphasis is being made on the Cartan tensor and its derivatives. Vanishing of the hv-curvature tensors of these connections characterizes Landsbergian, Berwaldian as well as Riemannian structures. This view point makes it possible to give a smart representation of connection theory in Finsler geometry and yields to a classification of Finsler connections. Some practical applications of these connections are also considered.
