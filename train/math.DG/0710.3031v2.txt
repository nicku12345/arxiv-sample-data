We show that which that for a Berwald structure, any Riemannian structure that is preserved by the Berwald connection leaves the indicatrix invariant under horizontal parallel transport. We also obtain the converse result: if ({\bf M},F) is a Finsler structure such that there exists a Riemannian structure that leaves invariant the indicatrix under parallel transport of the associated Levi-Civita connection, then the structure ({\bf M},F) is Berwald. As application, a necessary condition for pure Landsberg spaces is formulated. Using this criterion we provide an strategy to solve the existence or not of pure Landsberg surfaces
