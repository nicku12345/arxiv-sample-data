A conformal change of TM\oplus T^*M is a morphism of the form (X,\alpha)\mapsto(X,e^\tau\alpha) (X\in TM,\alpha\in T^*M,\tau\in C^\infty(M)). We characterize the generalized almost complex and almost Hermitian structures that are locally conformal to integrable and to generalized K\"ahler structures, respectively, and give examples of such structures.
