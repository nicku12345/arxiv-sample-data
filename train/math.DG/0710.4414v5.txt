Let (M^n,g_0) (n odd) be a compact Riemannian manifold with \lambda(g_0)>0, where \lambda(g_0) is the first eigenvalue of the operator -4\Delta_{g_0}+R(g_0), and R(g_0) is the scalar curvature of (M^n,g_0). Assume the maximal solution g(t) to the normalized Ricci flow with initial data (M^n,g_0) satisfies |R(g(t))| \leq C and \int_M |Rm(g(t))|^{n/2}d\mu_t \leq C uniformly for a constant C. Then we show that the solution sub-converges to a shrinking Ricci soliton. Moreover,when n=3, the condition \int_M |Rm(g(t))|^{n/2}d\mu_t \leq C can be removed.
