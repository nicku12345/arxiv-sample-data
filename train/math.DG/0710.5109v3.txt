We prove the existence and uniqueness of the solutions of some very general type of degenerate complex Monge-Amp\`ere equations. This type of equations is precisely what is needed in order to construct K\"ahler-Einstein metrics over irreducible singular K\"ahler spaces with ample or trivial canonical sheaf and singular K\"ahler-Einstein metrics over varieties of general type.
