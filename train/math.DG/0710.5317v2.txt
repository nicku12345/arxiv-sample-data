We give an explicit construction of any simply-connected superconformal surface \phi\colon M^2\to \R^4 in Euclidean space in terms of a pair of conjugate minimal surfaces g,h\colon M^2\to\R^4. That \phi is superconformal means that its ellipse of curvature is a circle at any point. We characterize the pairs (g,h) of conjugate minimal surfaces that give rise to images of holomorphic curves by an inversion in \R^4 and to images of superminimal surfaces in either a sphere \Sf^4 or a hyperbolic space \Hy^4 by an stereographic projection. We also determine the relation between the pairs (g,h) of conjugate minimal surfaces associated to a superconformal surface and its image by an inversion. In particular, this yields a new transformation for minimal surfaces in \R^4.
