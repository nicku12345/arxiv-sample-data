We study manifolds satisfying a weighed Poincare inequality, which was first introduced by Li-Wang. We generalized one of their results by relaxing the Ricci curvature bound condition only being satisfied outside a compact set and established a finitely many ends result. We proved a vanishing result for L^2 harmonic 1-form provided that the weight function \rho is of sub-quadratic growth of the distance function.
