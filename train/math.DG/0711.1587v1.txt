Here, an extension of the Obata-Tanno's theorem to Finsler geometry is established and the following rigidity result is obtained; Every complete connected Finsler manifold of positive constant flag curvature is isometrically homeomorphic to an n-sphere equipped with a certain Finsler metric, and vise versa.
