This is the first in a series of papers where we prove a conjecture of Deser and Schwimmer regarding the algebraic structure of ``global confor- mal invariants"; these are defined to be conformally invariant integrals of geometric scalars. The conjecture asserts that the integrand of any such integral can be expressed as a linear combination of a local conformal invariant, a divergence and of the Chern-Gauss-Bonnet integrand.   In this paper we set up an iterative procedure that proves the decom- position. We then derive the iterative step in the first of two cases, subject to a purely algebraic result which is proven in [6, 7, 8].
