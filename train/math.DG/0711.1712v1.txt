The nullity of a minimal submanifold M\subset S^{n} is the dimension of the nullspace of the second variation of the area functional. That space contains as a subspace the effect of the group of rigid motions SO(n+1) of the ambient space, modulo those motions which preserve M, whose dimension is the Killing nullity kn(M) of M. In the case of 2-dimensional tori M in S^{3}, there is an additional naturally-defined 2-dimensional subspace; the dimension of the sum of the action of the rigid motions and this space is the natural nullity nnt(M). In this paper we will study minimal tori in S^{3} with natural nullity less than 8. We construct minimal immersions of the plane R^{2} in S^{3} that contain all possible examples of tori with nnt(M)<8. We prove that the examples of Lawson and Hsiang with kn(M)=5 also have nnt(M)=5, and we prove that if the nnt(M)\le6 then the group of isometries of M is not trivial.
