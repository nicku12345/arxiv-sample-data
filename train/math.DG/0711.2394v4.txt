In this paper we find, for any arbitrary finite topological type, a compact Riemann surface \mathcal{M}, an open domain M\subset\mathcal{M} with the fixed topological type, and a conformal complete minimal immersion X:M\to\R^3 which can be extended to a continuous map X:\bar{M}\to\R^3, such that X_{|\partial M} is an embedding and the Hausdorff dimension of X(\partial M) is 1.   We also prove that complete minimal surfaces are dense in the space of minimal surfaces spanning a finite set of closed curves in \R^3, endowed with the topology of the Hausdorff distance.
