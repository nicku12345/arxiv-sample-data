Almost hypercomplex pseudo-Hermitian manifolds are considered. Isotropic hyper-K\"ahler manifolds are introduced. A 4-parametric family of 4-dimensional manifolds of this type is constructed on a Lie group. This family is characterized geometrically. The condition a 4-manifold to be isotropic hyper-K\"ahler is given.
