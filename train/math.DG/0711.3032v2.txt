Given a Lorentzian manifold (M,g), a geodesic \gamma in M and a timelike Jacobi field \mathcal Y along \gamma, we introduce a special class of instants along \gamma that we call \mathcal Y-pseudo conjugate (or focal relatively to some initial orthogonal submanifold). We prove that the \mathcal Y-pseudo conjugate instants form a finite set, and their number equals the Morse index of (a suitable restriction of) the index form. This gives a Riemannian-like Morse index theorem. As special cases of the theory, we will consider geodesics in stationary and static Lorentzian manifolds, where the Jacobi field \mathcal Y is obtained as the restriction of a globally defined timelike Killing vector field.
