Let (M^{n},g) be a compact Riemannian manifold with Ric\geq-(n-1) . It is well known that the bottom of spectrum \lambda_{0} of its unverversal covering satisfies \lambda_{0}\leq(n-1) ^{2}/4 . We prove that equality holds iff M is hyperbolic. This follows from a sharp estimate for the Kaimanovich entropy.
