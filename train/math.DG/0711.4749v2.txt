3-quasi-Sasakian manifolds were recently studied by the authors as a suitable setting unifying 3-Sasakian and 3-cosymplectic geometries. In this paper some geometric properties of this class of almost 3-contact metric manifolds are briefly reviewed, with an emphasis on those more related to physical applications.
