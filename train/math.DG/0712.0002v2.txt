The goal of the present paper is to propose an enhanced ordinary differential equations solver by exploitation of the powerful equivalence method of \'Elie Cartan. This solver returns a target equation equivalent to the equation to be solved and the transformation realizing the equivalence. The target ODE is a member of a dictionary of ODE, that are regarded as well-known, or at least well-studied. The dictionary considered in this article are ODE in a book of Kamke. The major advantage of our solver is that the equivalence transformation is obtained without integrating differential equations. We provide also a theoretical contribution revealing the relationship between the change of coordinates that maps two differential equations and their symmetry pseudo-groups.
