Given a positive function F on S^n which satisfies a convexity condition, for 1\leq r\leq n, we define the r-th anisotropic mean curvature function H^F_r for hypersurfaces in \mathbb{R}^{n+1} which is a generalization of the usual r-th mean curvature function. We prove that a compact embedded hypersurface without boundary in \R^{n+1} with H^F_r={constant} is the Wulff shape, up to translations and homotheties. In case r=1, our result is the anisotropic version of Alexandrov Theorem, which gives an affirmative answer to an open problem of F. Morgan.
