Let M^n be a complete, open Riemannian manifold with \Ric \geq 0. In 1994, Grigori Perelman showed that there exists a constant \delta_{n}>0, depending only on the dimension of the manifold, such that if the volume growth satisfies \alpha_M := \lim_{r \to \infty} \frac{\Vol(B_p(r))}{\omega_n r^n} \geq 1-\delta_{n}, then M^n is contractible. Here we employ the techniques of Perelman to find specific lower bounds for the volume growth, \alpha(k,n), depending only on k and n, which guarantee the individual k-homotopy group of M^n is trivial.
