There exists a well known construction which allows to associate with two hyperbolic affine spheres f_i: M_i^{n_i} \to \mathbb R^{n_i+1} a new hyperbolic affine sphere immersion of I \times M_1 \times M_2 into \mathbb R^{n_1+n_2+3}. In this paper we deal with the inverse problem: how to determine from properties of the difference tensor whether a given hyperbolic affine sphere immersion of a manifold M^n \to \mathbb R^{n+1} can be decomposed in such a way.
