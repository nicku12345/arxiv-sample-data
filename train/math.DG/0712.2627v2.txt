We partially describe equivariant Dirac and generalized complex structures on a homogeneous space G/K by giving equivalent data involving only the Lie algebra. We consider real semisimple adjoint orbits in any semisimple Lie algebra over \mathbb R and real nilpotent orbits in sl_n (\mathbb R). We give a complete classification for Riemannian symmetric spaces and for a compact group modulo a closed, connected subgroup containing a Cartan subgroup.
