We define two categories of Dirac manifolds, i.e. manifolds with complex Dirac structures. The first notion of maps I call \emph{Dirac maps}, and the category of Dirac manifolds is seen to contain the categories of Poisson and complex manifolds as full subcategories. The second notion, \emph{dual-Dirac maps}, defines a \emph{dual-Dirac category} which contains presymplectic and complex manifolds as full subcategories. The dual-Dirac maps are stable under B-transformations. In particular we get two structures of a category on Hitchin'sgeneralized complex manifolds, i.e., two reasonable notions of generalized complex maps. We also generalize further to get categories of Dirac manifolds for which the Dirac structures lie in arbitrary exact Courant algebroids. As an example, we consider the case of a Lie group with a complex Dirac structure and establish conditions for which multiplication is a Dirac map.
