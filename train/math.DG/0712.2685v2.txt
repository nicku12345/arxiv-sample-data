Let X be a compact Kahler manifold with a non-trivial holomorphic Poisson structure. Then there exist deformations of non-trivial generalized Kahler structures with one pure spinor on X. We prove that every Poisson submanifold of X is a generalized Kahler submanifold with respect to the deformed generalized Kahler structures and provide non-trivial examples of generalized Kahler submanifolds arising as holomorphic Poisson submanifolds. We also obtain unobstructed deformations of bi-Hermitian structures constructed from Poisson structures.
