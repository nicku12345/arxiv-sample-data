We prove here that when all planes transverse and nearly perpendicular to the axis of a surface of revolution intersect it in loops having central symmetry, the surface must be quadric. It follows that the quadrics are the only surfaces of revolution without skewloops. Similar statements hold for hypersurfaces of revolution in higher dimensions.
