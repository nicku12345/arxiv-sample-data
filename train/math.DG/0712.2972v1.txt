In this paper we prove a general and sharp Asymptotic Theorem for minimal surfaces in H^2\times R. As a consequence, we prove that there is no properly immersed minimal surface whose asymptotic boundary C is a Jordan curve homologous to zero in the asymptotic boundary of  H^2\times R, say \partial_\infty H^2\times R, such that C is contained in a slab between two horizontal circles of \partial_\infty H^2\times R with width equal to \pi.   We construct minimal vertical graphs in H^2\times R over certain unbounded admissible domains taking certain prescribed finite boundary data and certain prescribed asymptotic boundary data. Our admissible unbounded domains \Om in H^2\times \{0\} are non necessarily convex and non necessarily bounded by convex arcs; each component of its boundary is properly embedded with zero, one or two points on its asymptotic boundary, satisfying a further geometric condition.
