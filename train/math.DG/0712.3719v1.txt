In this letter we exhibit the relation between the isometries of a Riemannian contraction of a sub-Riemannian manifold and those of the sub-Riemannian metric, for to use this relation with two goals: establishing a result about the existence of fixed points of isometries groups; and the other, defining a Multiresolution Analysis (MRA) on sub-Riemannian manifolds that it will permit to obtain Haar's bases on the manifolds before mentioned.   Keywords: Sub-Riemannian geometry, minimizing geodesic, Haar functions, self-similarity.
