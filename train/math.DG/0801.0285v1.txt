Using elementary comparison geometry, we prove:   Let (M,g) be a simply-connected complete Riemannian manifold of dimension \ge 3. Suppose that the sectional curvature K satisfies    -1-s(r) \le K \le -1, where r denotes distance to a fixed point in   M. If \lim_{r \rt \infty} e^{2r}s(r) =0, then (M,g) has to be isometric to {\mathbb H}^n.   The same proof also yields that if K satisfies -s(r) \le K \le 0 where \lim_{r \rt \infty} r^2s(r)=0, then (M,g) is isometric to \R^n, a result due to Greene and Wu. Our second result is a local one: Let (M,g) be any Riemannian manifold. For a \in \R, if K \le a on a geodesic ball B_p(R) in M and K = a on \partial B_p(R), then K= a  on B_p(R).
