In the last section of \cite{CompHyp} it is proved that the map \mathcal{I} is a finite-sheeted covering map between \mathcal{P} and \mathcal{M}. As \mathcal{M} is simply connected it is deduced that \mathcal{I} is a homeomorphism. The fact that \mathcal{P} is connected is missing. Here we provide a proof.
