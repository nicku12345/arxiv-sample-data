D.Freed has formulated and proved an index theorem on odd dimensional spin manifolds with boundary. The proof is based on analysis by Calderon and Seeley. In this note we are going to give a proof of this theorem using the heat kernels methods for boundary conditions of Dirichlet and Von Neumann type. Moreover we consider also the Atiyah-Patodi-Singer spectral boundary condition which is not considered in Freed's paper. As a direct consequence of the method, we will obtain some information about isospectral invariants of the boundary conditions. This proof does not uses the cobordism invariance of index and are easily generalized to family case.
