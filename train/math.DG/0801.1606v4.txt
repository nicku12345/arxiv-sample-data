The dimension of the space of SU(n) and translation invariant continuous valuations on \mathbb{C}^n, n \geq 2 is computed. For even n, this dimension equals (n^2+3n+10)/2; for odd n it equals (n^2+3n+6)/2. An explicit geometric basis of this space is constructed. The kinematic formulas for SU(n) are obtained as corollaries.
