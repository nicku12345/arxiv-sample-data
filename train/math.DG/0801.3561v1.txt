Given a positive function F on S^n which satisfies a convexity condition, we define the r-th anisotropic mean curvature function H^F_r for hypersurfaces in \mathbb{R}^{n+1} which is a generalization of the usual r-th mean curvature function. Let X:M\to \mathbb{R}^{n+1} be an n-dimensional closed hypersurface with H^F_{r+1}=constant, for some r with 0\leq r\leq n-1, which is a critical point for a variational problem. We show that X(M) is stable if and only if X(M) is the Wulff shape.
