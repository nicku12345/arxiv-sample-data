We generalize a Bernstein-type result due to Albujer and Al\'ias, for maximal surfaces in a curved Lorentzian product 3-manifold of the form \Sigma_1\times \mathbb{R}, to higher dimension and codimension. We consider M a complete spacelike graphic submanifold with parallel mean curvature, defined by a map f: \Sigma_1\to \Sigma_2 between two Riemannian manifolds (\Sigma_1^m, g_1) and (\Sigma^n_2, g_2) of sectional curvatures K_1 and K_2, respectively. We take on \Sigma_1\times \Sigma_2 the pseudo-Riemannian product metric g_1-g_2. Under the curvature conditions, \mathrm{Ricci}_1 \geq 0 and K_1\geq K_2, we prove that, if the second fundamental form of M satisfies an integrability condition, then M is totally geodesic, and it is a slice if \mathrm{Ricci}_1(p)>0 at some point. For bounded K_1, K_2 and hyperbolic angle \theta, we conclude M must be maximal. If M is a maximal surface and K_1\geq K_2^+, we show M is totally geodesic with no need for further assumptions. Furthermore, M is a slice if at some point p\in \Sigma_1, K_1(p)> 0, and if \Sigma_1 is flat and K_2<0 at some point f(p), then the image of f lies on a geodesic of \Sigma_2.
