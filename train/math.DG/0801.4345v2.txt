Suppose {\cal L} is a lamination of a Riemannian manifold by hypersurfaces with the same constant mean curvature. We prove that every limit leaf of {\cal L} is stable for the Jacobi operator. A simple but important consequence of this result is that the set of stable leaves of {\cal L} has the structure of a lamination.
