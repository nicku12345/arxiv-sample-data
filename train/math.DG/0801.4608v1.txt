By performing required evaluations, we show that in the Finsleroid-regular space the Landsberg-space condition just degenerates to the Berwald-space condition (at any dimension number N\ge2). Simple and clear expository representations are obtained. Due comparisons with the Finsleroid-Finsler space are indicated.   Keywords: Finsler metrics, spray coefficients, curvature tensors.
