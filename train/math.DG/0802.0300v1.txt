By extending Koiso's examples to the non-compact case, we construct complete gradient Kahler-Ricci solitons of various types on certain holomorphic line bundles over compact Kahler-Einstein manifolds. Moreover, a uniformization result on steady gradient Kahler-Ricci solitons with non-negative Ricci curvature is obtained under additional assumptions.
