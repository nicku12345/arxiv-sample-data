We analyse some properties of the cohomogeneity one Ricci soliton equations, and use Ansatze of cohomogeneity one type to produce new explicit examples of complete Kahler Ricci solitons of expanding, steady and shrinking types. These solitons are foliated by hypersurfaces which are circle bundles over a product of Fano Kahler-Einstein manifolds or over coadjoint orbits of a compact connected semisimple Lie group.
