We provide a parametric construction in terms of minimal surfaces of the Euclidean submanifolds of codimension two and arbitrary dimension that attain equality in an inequality due to De Smet, Dillen, Verstraelen and Vrancken. The latter involves the scalar curvature, the norm of the normal curvature tensor and the length of the mean curvature vector.
