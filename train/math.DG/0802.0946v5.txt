Given (\bar{M},\Omega) a calibrated Riemannian manifold with a parallel calibration of rank m, and M^m an immersed orientable submanifold with parallel mean curvature H we prove that if \cos \theta is bounded away from zero, where \theta is the \Omega-angle of M, and if M has zero Cheeger constant, then M is minimal. In the particular case M is complete with   Ricc^M\geq 0 we may replace the boundedness condition on \cos \theta by \cos \theta\geq Cr^{-\beta}, when r\to +\infty, where  0\leq\beta <1  and C > 0 are constants and r is the distance function to a point in M. Our proof is surprisingly simple and extends to a very large class of submanifolds in calibrated manifolds, in a unified way, the problem started by Heinz and Chern of estimating the mean curvature of graphic hypersurfaces in Euclidean spaces. It is based on a estimation of \|H\| in terms of \cos\theta and an isoperimetric inequality. We also give some conditions to conclude M is totally geodesic. We study some particular cases.
