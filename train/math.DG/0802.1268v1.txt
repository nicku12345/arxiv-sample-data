In this paper we introduce a natural definition for the affine maps between two Finsler manifolds (M, F) and (N,\tilde F) and we give some geometrical properties of these affine maps. Starting from the equations of the affine maps, we construct a natural Berwald-Riemann-Lagrange geometry on the 1-jet space J^1(TM;N), in the sense of a Berwald nonlinear connection \Gamma^b_jet, a Berwald \Gamma^b_jet-linear d-connection B\Gamma^b_jet, together with its d-torsions and d-curvatures, which geometrically characterizes the initial affine maps between Finsler manifolds.
