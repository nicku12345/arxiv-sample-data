Let M be a topological G_2-manifold. We prove that the space of infinitesimal associative deformations of a compact associative submanifold Y with boundary in a coassociative submanifold X is the solution space of an elliptic problem. For a connected boundary \partial Y of genus g, the index is given by \int_{\partial Y}c_1(\nu_X)+1-g, where \nu_X denotes the orthogonal complement of T\partial Y in TX_{|\partial Y} and c_1(\nu_X) the first Chern class of \nu_X with respect to its natural complex structure. Further, we exhibit explicit examples of non-trivial index.
