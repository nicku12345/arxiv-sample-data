An Einstein nilradical is a nilpotent Lie algebra, which can be the nilradical of a metric Einstein solvable Lie algebra. The classification of Riemannian Einstein solvmanifolds (possibly, of all noncompact homogeneous Einstein spaces) can be reduced to determining, which nilpotent Lie algebras are Einstein nilradicals and to finding, for every Einstein nilradical, its Einstein metric solvable extension. For every nilpotent Lie algebra, we construct an (essentially unique) derivation, the pre-Einstein derivation, the solvable extension by which may carry an Einstein inner product. Using the pre-Einstein derivation, we then give a variational characterization of Einstein nilradicals. As an application, we prove an easy-to-check convex geometry condition for a nilpotent Lie algebra with a nice basis to be an Einstein nilradical and also show that a typical two-step nilpotent Lie algebra is an Einstein nilradical.
