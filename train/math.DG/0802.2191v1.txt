We prove that any strongly regular Weingarten surface in Euclidean space carries locally geometric principal parameters. The basic theorem states that any strongly regular Weingarten surface is determined up to a motion by its structural functions and the normal curvature function satisfying a geometric differential equation. We apply these results to the special Weingarten surfaces: minimal surfaces, surfaces of constant mean curvature and surfaces of constant Gauss curvature.
