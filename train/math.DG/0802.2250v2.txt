If Y is a properly embedded minimal surface in a convex cocompact hyperbolic 3-manifold M with boundary at infinity an embedded curve \gamma, then Graham and Witten showed how to define a renormalized area \calA of Y via Hadamard regularization. We study renormalized area as a functional on the space of all such minimal surfaces. This requires a closer examination of these moduli spaces; following White and Coskunuzer, we prove these are Banach manifolds and that the natural map taking Y to \gamma is Fredholm of index zero and proper, which leads to the existence of a \ZZ-valued degree theory for this mapping. We show that \calA(Y) can be expressed as a sum of the Euler characteristic of Y and the total integral of norm squared of the trace-free second fundamental form of Y. An extension of renormalized area to a wider class of nonminimal surfaces has a similar formula also involving the integral of mean curvature squared. We prove a formula for the first variation of renormalized area, and characterize the critical points when M = \HH^3 and \gamma has a single component. All of these results have analogues for 4-dimensional Poincar\'e-Einstein metrics. We conclude by discussing the relationship of \calA to the Willmore functional.
