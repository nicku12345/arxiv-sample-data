The aim of this paper is to construct a natural Riemann-Lagrange differential geometry on 1-jet spaces, in the sense of nonlinear connections, generalized Cartan connections, d-torsions, d-curvatures, jet electromagnetic fields and jet electromagnetic Yang-Mills energies, starting from some given nonlinear evolution ODEs systems modelling biologic phenomena like the cancer cell population model or the infection by human immunodeficiency virus-type 1 (HIV-1) model.
