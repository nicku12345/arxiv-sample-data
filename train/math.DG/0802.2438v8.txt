We provide the first explicit examples of deformations of higher dimensional quadrics: a straightforward generalization of Peterson's explicit 1-dimensional family of deformations in \mathbb{C}^3 of 2-dimensional general quadrics with common conjugate system given by the spherical coordinates on the complex sphere \mathbb{S}^2\subset\mathbb{C}^3 to an explicit (n-1)-dimensional family of deformations in \mathbb{C}^{2n-1} of n-dimensional general quadrics with common conjugate system given by the spherical coordinates on the complex sphere \mathbb{S}^n\subset\mathbb{C}^{n+1} and non-degenerate joined second fundamental forms. It is then proven that this family is maximal.
