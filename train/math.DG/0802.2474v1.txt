We observe inequalities involving the Herzlich volume of a 4-dimensional asymptotically complex hyperbolic Einstein manifold and its Euler characteristic provided the metrics is either Kaehler or selfdual. In the selfdual case we have to assume furthermore that the Kronheimer-Mrowka invariant is non vanishing.
