The aim of this paper is to expose some geometrical properties of the locally Minkowski-Cartan space with the Berwald-Moor metric of momenta. This space is regarded as a particular case of the m-th root Cartan space. Thus, Section 2 studies the v-covariant derivation components of the m-th root Cartan space. Section 3 computes the v-curvature d-tensor S^{hijk} of the m-th root Cartan space and studies conditions for S3-likeness. Section 4 computes the T-tensor T^{hijk} of the m-th root Cartan space. Section 5 particularizes the preceding geometrical results for the Berwald-Moor metric of momenta.
