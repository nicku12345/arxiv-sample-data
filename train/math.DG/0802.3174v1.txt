We show that, on any asymptotically hyperbolic surface, the essential spectrum of the Lichnerowicz Laplacian \Delta_L contains the ray [{1/4},+\infty[. If moreover the scalar curvature is constant then -2 and 0 are infinite dimensional eigenvalues. If, in addition, the inequality <\Delta u, u>_{L^2}\geq \frac14||u||^2_{L^2} holds for all smooth compactly supported function u, then there is no other value in the spectrum.
