Let X be a closed hyperbolic surface and \lambda, \eta be weighted geodesic multicurves which are short on X. We show that the iterated grafting along \lambda and \eta is close in the Teichmueller metric to grafting along a single multicurve which can be given explicitly in terms of \lambda and \eta.   Using this result, we study the holonomy lifts gr_{\lambda}\rho_{X,\lambda} of Teichmueller geodesics \rho_{X,\lambda} for integral laminations \lambda and show that all of them have bounded Teichmueller distance to the geodesic \rho_{X,\lambda}. We obtain analogous results for grafting rays.   Finally we consider the asymptotic behaviour of iterated grafting sequences \gr_{n\lambda}X and show that they converge geometrically to a punctured surface.
