Let \phi:M\to\mathbb{S}^{n+1}\subset\mathbb{R}^{n+2} be an immersion of a complete n-dimensional oriented manifold. For any v\in\mathbb{R}^{n+2}, let us denote by \ell_v:M\to\mathbb{R} the function given by \ell_v(x)=\phi(x),v and by f_v:M\to\mathbb{R}, the function given by f_v(x)=\nu(x),v, where \nu:M\to\mathbb{S}^{n} is a Gauss map. We will prove that if M has constant mean curvature, and, for some v\ne{\bf 0} and some real number \lambda, we have that \ell_v=\lambda f_v, then, \phi(M) is either a totally umbilical sphere or a Clifford hypersurface. As an application, we will use this result to prove that the weak stability index of any compact constant mean curvature hypersurface M^n in \mathbb{S}^{n+1} which is neither totally umbilical nor a Clifford hypersurface and has constant scalar curvature is greater than or equal to 2n+4.
