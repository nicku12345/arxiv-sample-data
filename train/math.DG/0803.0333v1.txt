We derive a class of variational functionals which arise naturally in conformal geometry. In the special case when the Riemannian manifold is locally conformal flat, the functional coincides with the well studied functional which is the integration over the manifold of the k-symmetric function of the Schouten tensor of the metric on the manifold.
