We obtain a generalization of the Kodaira-Morrow stability theorem for cosymplectic structures. We investigate cosymplectic geometry on Lie groups and on their compact quotients by uniform discrete subgroups. In this way we show that a compact solvmanifold admits a cosymplectic structure if and only if it is a finite quotient of a torus.
