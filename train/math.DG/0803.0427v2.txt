We present a compared analysis of some properties of indefinite almost \mathcal{S}-manifolds and indefinite \mathcal{S}-manifolds. We give some characterizations in terms of the Levi-Civita connection and of the characteristic vector fields. We study the sectional and {\phi}-sectional curvature of indefinite almost \mathcal{S}-manifolds and state an expression of the curvature tensor field for the indefinite \mathcal{S}-space forms. We analyse the sectional curvature of indefinite \mathcal{S}-manifold in which the number of the spacelike characteristic vector fields is equal to that of the timelike characteristic vector fields. Some examples are also described.
