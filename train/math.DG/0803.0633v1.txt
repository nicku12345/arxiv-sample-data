We prove that a constrained Willmore immersion of a 2-torus into the conformal 4-sphere is either of "finite type", that is, has a spectral curve of finite genus, or is of "holomorphic type" which means that it is super conformal or Euclidean minimal with planar ends. This implies that all constrained Willmore tori in the 4-sphere can be constructed rather explicitly by methods of complex algebraic geometry. The proof uses quaternionic holomorphic geometry in combination with integrable systems methods similar to those of Hitchin's approach to the study of harmonic tori in the 3-sphere.
