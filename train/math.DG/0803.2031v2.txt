We prove that a holomorphic Lie algebroid is integrable if, and only if, its underlying real Lie algebroid is integrable. Thus the integrability criteria of Crainic-Fernandes do also apply in the holomorphic context without any modification. As a consequence we give another proof of the following theorem: a holomorphic Poisson manifold is integrable if, and only if, its real (or imaginary) part is integrable as a real Poisson manifold.
