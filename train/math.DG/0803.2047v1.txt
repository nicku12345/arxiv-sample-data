We introduce the concept of Loday algebroids, a generalization of Courant algebroids. We define the naive cohomology and modular class of a Loday algebroid, and we show that the modular class of the double of a Lie bialgebroid vanishes. For Courant algebroids, we describe the relation between the naive and standard cohomologies and we conjecture that they are isomorphic when the Courant algebroid is transitive.
