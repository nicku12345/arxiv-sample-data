Given a pair of (real or complex) Lie algebroid structures on a vector bundle A (over M) and its dual A^*, and a line bundle \module such that \module\otimes\module=(\wedge^{\TOP} A^*\otimes\wedge^{\TOP} T^*M), there exist two canonically defined differential operators \bdees and \bdel on \sections{\wedge A\otimes\module}. We prove that the pair (A,A^*) constitutes a Lie bialgebroid if, and only if, the square of \bdirac =\bdees+\bdel is the multiplication by a function on M. As a consequence, we obtain that the pair (A,A^*) is a Lie bialgebroid if, and only if, \bdirac is a Dirac generating operator as defined by Alekseev & Xu \cite{AlekseevXu}. Our approach is to establish a list of new identities relating the Lie algebroid structures on A and A^* (Theorem \ref{Thm:C}).
