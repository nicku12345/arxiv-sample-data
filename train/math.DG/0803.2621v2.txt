We give a spinorial characterization of isometrically immersed hypersurfaces into 4-dimensional space forms and product spaces \M^3(\kappa)\times\R, in terms of the existence of particular spinor fields, called generalized Killing spinors or equivalently solutions of a Dirac equation. This generalizes to higher dimensions several recent results for surfaces by T. Friedrich, B. Morel and the two authors. The main argument is the interpretation of the energy-momentum tensor of a generalized Killing spinor as the second fundamental form, possibly up to a tensor depending on the ambient space. As an application, we deduce a non-existence result for hypersurfaces in the 4-dimensional Euclidean space.
