In this article, we prove new rigidity results for compact Riemannian spin manifolds with boundary whose scalar curvature is bounded from below by a non-positive constant. In particular, we obtain generalizations of a result of Hang-Wang \cite{hangwang1} based on a conjecture of Schroeder and Strake \cite{schroeder}.
