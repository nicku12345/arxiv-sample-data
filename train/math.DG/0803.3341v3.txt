In this paper we give a geometrical interpretation of all the second elliptic integrable systems associated to 4-symmetric spaces. We first show that a 4-symmetric space G/G_0 can be embedded into the twistor space of the corresponding symmetric space G/H. Then we prove that the second elliptic system is equivalent to the vertical harmonicity of an admissible twistor lift J taking values in G/G_0 \hookrightarrow \Sigma(G/H). We begin the paper by an example: G/H=\R^4. We study also the structure of 4-symmetric bundles over Riemannian symmetric spaces.
