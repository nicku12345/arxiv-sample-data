A Hadwiger-type theorem for the exceptional Lie groups G_2 and Spin(7) is proved. The algebras of G_2 or Spin(7) invariant, translation invariant continuous valuations are both of dimension 10. Geometrically meaningful bases are constructed and the algebra structures are computed. Finally, the kinematic formulas for these groups are determined.
