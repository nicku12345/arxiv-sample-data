In early 80's M.Gromov showed that there exists a constant \epsilon such that any compact Riemannian manifold M^n with |K|_{M^n} \cdot diam^2(M^n) \leq \epsilon can be finitely covered by a nilmanifold. The present paper illustrates by an explicit example that the pinching constant \epsilon depends on the dimension n of the manifold, in particular, it decreases with the dimension at least as \frac{12}{n^2}.
