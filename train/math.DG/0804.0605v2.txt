We compare some natural triangulations of the Teichm\"uller space of hyperbolic surfaces with geodesic boundary and of some bordifications. We adapt Scannell-Wolf's proof to show that grafting semi-infinite cylinders at the ends of hyperbolic surfaces with fixed boundary lengths is a homeomorphism. This way, we construct a family of triangulations of the Teichm\"uller space of punctures surfaces that interpolates between Penner-Bowditch-Epstein's (using the spine construction) and Harer-Mumford-Thurston's (using Strebel's differentials). Finally, we show (adapting arguments of Dumas) that on a fixed punctured surface, when the triangulation approaches HMT's, the associated Strebel differential is well-approximated by the Schwarzian of the associated projective structure and by the Hopf differential of the collapsing map.
