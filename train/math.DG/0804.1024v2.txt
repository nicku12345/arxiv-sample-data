In this article, we prove a Sobolev-like inequality for the Dirac operator on closed compact Riemannian spin manifolds with a nearly optimal Sobolev constant. As an application, we give a criterion for the existence of solutions to a nonlinear equation with critical Sobolev exponent involving the Dirac operator. We finally specify a case where this equation can be solved.
