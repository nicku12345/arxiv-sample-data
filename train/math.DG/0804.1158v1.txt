We show that sequences of compact gradient Ricci solitons converge to complete orbifold gradient solitons, assuming constraints on volume, the L^{n/2}-norm of curvature, and the auxiliary constant C_1. The strongest results are in dimension 4, where L^2 curvature bounds are equivalent to upper bounds on the Euler number. We obtain necessary and sufficient conditions for limits to be compact.
