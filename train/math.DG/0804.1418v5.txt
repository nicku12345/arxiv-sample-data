We prove a surgery formula for the smooth Yamabe invariant \sigma(M) of a compact manifold M. Assume that N is obtained from M by surgery of codimension at least 3. We prove the existence of a positive number \Lambda_n, depending only on the dimension n of M, such that  \sigma(N) \geq \min{\sigma(M),\Lambda_n}.
