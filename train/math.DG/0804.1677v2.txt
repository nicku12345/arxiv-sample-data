We study isometric Lie group actions on the compact exceptional groups E6, E7, E8, F4 and G2 endowed with a biinvariant metric. We classify polar actions on these groups. We determine all isometric actions of cohomogeneity less than three on E6, E7, F4 and all isometric actions of cohomogeneity less than 20 on E8. Moreover we determine the principal isotropy algebras for all isometric actions on G2.
