In this paper we establish some parabolicity criteria for maximal surfaces immersed into a Lorentzian product space of the form M^2\times\mathbb{R}_1, where M^2 is a connected Riemannian surface with non-negative Gaussian curvature and M^2\times\mathbb{R}_1 is endowed with the Lorentzian product metric <,>=<,>_M-dt^2. In particular, and as an application of our main result, we deduce that every maximal graph over a starlike domain \Omega\subseteq M is parabolic. This allows us to give an alternative proof of the non-parametric version of the Calabi-Bernstein result for entire maximal graphs in M^2\times\mathbb{R}_1.
