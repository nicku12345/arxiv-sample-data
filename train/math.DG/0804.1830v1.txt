We describe how the loop group maps corresponding to special submanifolds associated to integrable systems may be thought of as certain Grassmann submanifolds of infinite dimensional homogeneous spaces. In general, the associated families of special submanifolds are certain Grassmann submanifolds. An example is given from recent work of the author.
