Let \rho_0 be an action of a Lie group on a manifold with boundary that is transitive on the interior. We study the set of actions that are topologically conjugate to \rho_0, up to smooth or analytic change of coordinates. We show that in many cases, including the compactifications of negatively curved symmetric spaces, this set is infinite.
