We propose a unified definition for discrete analogues of constant mean curvature surfaces in spaces of constant curvature as a special case of discrete special isothermic nets. B\"acklund transformations and Lawson's correspondence are discussed. It is shown that the definition generalizes previous definitions and a construction for discrete cmc surfaces of revolution in space forms is provided.
