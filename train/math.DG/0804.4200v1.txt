We consider compact connected minimal surfaces, with a pair of boundary curves (not necessarily convex) in distinct planes, that have least-area amongst all orientable surfaces with the same boundary. When the planes containing these two boundary curves are either parallel or sufficiently close to parallel, and when the boundary curves themselves are sufficiently close to each other, we draw specific conclusions about the geometry and topology of the surfaces. We also strength the following result: Let M be any compact minimal annulus with two planar boundary curves of diameters d_1 and d_2 in parallel planes P_1 and P_2; if the distance between P_1 and P_2 is h, then the inequality h \leq {3/2}\max\{d_1,d_2\} is satisfied. We strength it by removing the assumption that M is an annulus and by showing that the stronger conclusion h \leq \max\{d_1,d_2\} holds. We also include a similar result for nonminimal constant mean curvature surfaces.
