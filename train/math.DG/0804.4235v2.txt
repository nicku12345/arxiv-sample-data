An order four automorphism of a Lie algebra gives rise to an integrable system discussed by Terng. We show that solutions of this system may be identified with certain vertically harmonic twistor lifts of conformal maps of surfaces in a Riemannian symmetric space.   Specialising to 4-dimensional target, we find that surfaces with holomorphic mean curvature in 4-dimensional spaces with constant sectional or holomorphic sectional curvatures constitute an integrable system as do Hamiltonian stationary Lagrangian surfaces in a 4-dimensional Hermitian symmetric space (this last being a result of Helein-Romon).
