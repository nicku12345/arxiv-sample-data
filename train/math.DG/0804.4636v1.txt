We give lower bounds for the fundamental tone of open sets in submanifolds with locally bounded mean curvature in  N \times \mathbb{R}, where N is an n-dimensional complete Riemannian manifold with radial sectional curvature K_{N} \leq \kappa. When the immersion is minimal our estimates are sharp. We also show that cylindrically bounded minimal surfaces has positive fundamental tone.
