Consider a strictly convex bounded regular domain C of \R^3. For any arbitrary finite topological type we find a compact Riemann surface \mathcal{M}, an open domain M\subset \mathcal{M} with the fixed topological type, and a conformal complete proper minimal immersion X:M\to C which can be extended to a continuous map X:\overline{M}\to \overline{C}.
