We show that a complete submanifold M with tamed second fundamental form in a complete Riemannian manifold N with sectional curvature K_{N}\leq \kappa \leq 0 are proper, (compact if N is compact). In addition, if N is Hadamard then M has finite topology. We also show that the fundamental tone is an obstruction for a Riemannian manifold to be realized as submanifold with tamed second fundamental form of a Hadamard manifold with sectional curvature bounded below.
