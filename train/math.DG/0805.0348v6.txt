In this note we introduce a Yang-Mills bar equation on complex vector bundles over compact Hermitian manifolds as the Euler-Lagrange equation for a Yang-Mills bar functional. We show the existence of a non-trivial solution of this equation over compact K\"ahler manifolds as well as a short time existence of the negative Yang-Mills bar gradient flow. We also show a rigidity of holomorphic connections among a class of Yang-Mills bar connections over compact K\"ahler manifolds of positive Ricci curvature.
