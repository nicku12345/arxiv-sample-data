A Riemannian Einstein solvmanifold (possibly, any noncompact homogeneous Einstein space) is almost completely determined by the nilradical of its Lie algebra. A nilpotent Lie algebra, which can serve as the nilradical of an Einstein metric solvable Lie algebra, is called an Einstein nilradical. Despite a substantial progress towards the understanding of Einstein nilradicals, there is still a lack of classification results even for some well-studied classes of nilpotent Lie algebras, such as the two-step ones. In this paper, we give a classification of two-step nilpotent Einstein nilradicals in one of the rare cases when the complete set of affine invariants is known: for the two-step nilpotent Lie algebras with the two-dimensional center. Informally speaking, we prove that such a Lie algebra is an Einstein nilradical, if it is defined by a matrix pencil having no nilpotent blocks in the canonical form and no elementary divisors of a very high multiplicity. We also discuss the connection between the property of a two-step nilpotent Lie algebra and its dual to be an Einstein nilradical.
