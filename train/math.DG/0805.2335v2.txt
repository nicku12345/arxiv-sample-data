We give a procedure for constructing an 8n-dimensional HKT Lie algebra starting from a 4n-dimensional one by using a quaternionic representation of the latter. The strong (respectively, weak, hyper-K\"ahler, balanced) condition is preserved by our construction. As an application of our results we obtain a new compact HKT manifold with holonomy in SL(n,\Bbb H) which is not a nilmanifold. We find in addition new compact strong HKT manifolds.   We also show that every K\"ahler Lie algebra equipped with a flat, torsion-free complex connection gives rise to an HKT Lie algebra. We apply this method to two distinguished 4-dimensional K\"ahler Lie algebras, thereby obtaining two conformally balanced HKT metrics in dimension 8.   Both techniques prove to be an effective tool for giving the explicit expression of the corresponding HKT metrics.
