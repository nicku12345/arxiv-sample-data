With the developments of the last decade on complete constant mean curvature 1 (CMC 1) surfaces in the hyperbolic 3-space H^3, many examples of such surfaces are now known. However, most of the known examples have regular ends. (An end is irregular, resp. regular, if the hyperbolic Gauss map of the surface has an essential singularity, resp. at most a pole, there.) There are some known surfaces with irregular ends, but they are all either reducible or of infinite total curvature. (The surface is reducible if and only if the monodromy of the secondary Gauss map can be simultaneously diagonalized.) Up to now there have been no known complete irreducible CMC 1 surfaces in H^3 with finite total curvature and irregular ends. The purpose of this paper is to construct countably many 1-parameter families of genus zero CMC 1 surfaces with irregular ends and finite total curvature, which have either dihedral or Platonic symmetries. For all the examples we produce, we show that they have finite total curvature and irregular ends. For the examples with dihedral symmetry and the simplest example with tetrahedral symmetry, we show irreducibility. Moreover, we construct a genus one CMC 1 surface with four irregular ends, which is the first known example with positive genus whose ends are all irregular.
