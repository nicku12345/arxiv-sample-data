In this article we prove a differentiable rigidity result. Let (Y, g) and (X, g_0) be two closed n-dimensional Riemannian manifolds (n\geqslant 3) and f:Y\to X be a continuous map of degree 1. We furthermore assume that the metric g_0 is real hyperbolic and denote by d the diameter of (X,g_0). We show that there exists a number \varepsilon:=\varepsilon (n, d)>0 such that if the Ricci curvature of the metric g is bounded below by -n(n-1) and its volume satisfies \vol_g (Y)\leqslant (1+\varepsilon) \vol_{g_0} (X) then the manifolds are diffeomorphic. The proof relies on Cheeger-Colding's theory of limits of Riemannian manifolds under lower Ricci curvature bound.
