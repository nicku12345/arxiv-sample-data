We study transverse conformal Killing forms on foliations and prove a Gallot-Meyer theorem for foliations. Moreover, we show that on a foliation with C-positive normal curvature, if there is a closed basic 1-form \phi such that \Delta_B\phi=qC\phi, then the foliation is transversally isometric to the quotient of a q-sphere.
