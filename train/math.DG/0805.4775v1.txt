Colding and Minicozzi have shown that an embedded minimal disk 0\in\Sigma\subset B_R in \Real^3 with large curvature at 0 looks like a helicoid on the scale of R. Near 0, this can be sharpened: on the scale of |A|^{-1}(0), \Sigma is close, in a Lipschitz sense, to a piece of a helicoid. We use surfaces constructed by Colding and Minicozzi to see this description cannot hold on the scale R.
