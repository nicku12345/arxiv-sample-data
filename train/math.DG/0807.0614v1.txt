The aim of this paper is to present the main geometrical objects on the dual 1-jet bundle J^{1*}(\cal{T},M) (this is the polymomentum phase space of the De Donder-Weyl covariant Hamiltonian formulation of field theory) that characterize our approach of multi-time Hamilton geometry. In this direction, we firstly introduce the geometrical concept of a nonlinear connection N on the dual 1-jet space J^{1*}(\cal{T},M). Then, starting with a given N-linear connection D on J^{1*}(\cal{T},M), we describe the adapted components of the torsion, curvature and deflection distinguished tensors attached to the N-linear connection D.
