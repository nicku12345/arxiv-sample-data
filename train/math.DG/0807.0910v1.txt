In this paper we study some geometrical objects (d-tensors, multi-time semisprays of polymomenta and nonlinear connections) on the dual 1-jet vector bundle J^{1*}(\cal{T}, M)\to \cal{T}\times M. Some geometrical formulas, which connect the last two geometrical objects, are also derived. Finally, a canonical nonlinear connection produced by a Kronecker h-regular multi-time Hamiltonian is given.
