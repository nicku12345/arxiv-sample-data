We generalize the following result of White: Suppose N is a compact, strictly convex domain in \RR^3 with smooth boundary. Let \Sigma be a compact 2-manifold with boundary. Then a generic smooth curve \Gamma\cong \partial\Sigma in \partial N bounds an odd or even number of embedded minimal surfaces diffeomorphic to \Sigma according to whether \Sigma is or is not a union of disks. First, we prove that the parity theorem holds for any compact riemannian 3-manifold N such that N is strictly mean convex, N is homeomorphic to a ball, \partial N is smooth, and N contains no closed minimal surfaces. We then further relax the hypotheses by allowing N to be weakly mean convex and to have piecewise smooth boundary. We extend the parity theorem yet further by showing that, under an additional hypothesis, it remains true for minimal surfaces with prescribed symmetries.   The parity theorems are used in an essential way to prove the existence of embedded genus-g helicoids in \SS^2\times \RR. We give a very brief outline of this application. (The full argument will appear elsewhere.)
