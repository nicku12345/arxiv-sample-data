We construct harmonic diffeomorphisms from the complex plane C onto any Hadamard surface M whose curvature is bounded above by a negative constant. For that, we prove a Jenkins-Serrin type theorem for minimal graphs in M\times R over domains of M bounded by ideal geodesic polygons and show the existence of a sequence of minimal graphs over polygonal domains converging to an entire minimal graph in M\times R with the conformal structure of C.
