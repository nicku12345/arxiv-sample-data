Given an oriented Riemannian surface (\Sigma, g), its tangent bundle T\Sigma enjoys a natural pseudo-K\"{a}hler structure, that is the combination of a complex structure \J, a pseudo-metric \G with neutral signature and a symplectic structure \Om. We give a local classification of those surfaces of T\Sigma which are both Lagrangian with respect to \Om and minimal with respect to \G. We first show that if g is non-flat, the only such surfaces are affine normal bundles over geodesics. In the flat case there is, in contrast, a large set of Lagrangian minimal surfaces, which is described explicitly. As an application, we show that motions of surfaces in \R^3 or \R^3_1 induce Hamiltonian motions of their normal congruences, which are Lagrangian surfaces in T\S^2 or T \H^2 respectively. We relate the area of the congruence to a second-order functional \mathcal{F}=\int \sqrt{H^2-K} dA on the original surface.
