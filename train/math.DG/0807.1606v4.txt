In this paper, we show that an irreducible proper complex equifocal submanifold of codimension greater than one in a symmetric space of non-compact type. The proof is performed by showing the homogeneity of the lift of the complexification of the original submanifold to some infinite dimensional anti-Kahelerian space.
