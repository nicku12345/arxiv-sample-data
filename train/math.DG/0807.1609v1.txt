The notion of a complex hyperpolar action on a symmetric space of non-compact type has recently been introduced as counterpart of a hyperpolar action on a symmetric space of compact type. In this paper, we construct examples of a complex hyperpolar action without singular orbit and investigate the geometry of the orbits of the examples.
