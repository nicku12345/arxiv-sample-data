In this paper we study almost complex manifolds admitting a quasi-K\"ahler Chern-flat metric (Chern-flat means that the holonomy of the Chern connection is trivial). We prove that in the compact case such manifolds are all nilmanifolds. Some partial classification results are established and we prove that a quasi-K\"ahler Chern-flat structure can be tamed by a symplectic form if and only if the ambient space is isomorphic to a flat torus.
