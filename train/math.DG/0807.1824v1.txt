In this paper we deal with some properties of a class of semi-Riemannian submersions between manifolds endowed with paraquaternionic structures, proving a result of non-existence of paraquaternionic submersions between paraquaternionic K\"ahler non locally hyper paraK\"ahler manifolds. Then we examine, as an example, the canonical projection of the tangent bundle, endowed with the Sasaki metric, of an almost paraquaternionic Hermitian manifold.
