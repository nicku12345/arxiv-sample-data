In this paper biharmonic maps between doubly warped product manifolds are studied. We show that the inclusion maps of Riemannian manifolds B and F into the doubly warped product _{f}B\times_{b}F can not be proper biharmonic maps. Also we analyze the conditions for the biharmonicity of projections _{f}B\times_{b}F\to B and _{f}B\times_{b}F\to F, respectively. Some characterizations for non-harmonic biharmonic maps are given by using product of harmonic maps and warping metric. Specially, in the case of f=1, the results for warped product in \cite{Balmus-mont} are obtained.
