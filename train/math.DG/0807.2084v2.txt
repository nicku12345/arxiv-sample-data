This article sets out to serve a dual purpose. On the one hand, we give an explicit description of the Lagrangian submanifolds of the nearly Kaehler 6-sphere which are ruled by circles of constant radius using Weierstrass formulae. On the other, we recognise all previous known examples of these Lagrangians as being ruled by such circles. Therefore, we describe all families of Lagrangians in the 6-sphere whose second fundamental form satisfies natural pointwise conditions: so-called second order families.
