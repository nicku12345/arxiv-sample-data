In this note we prove the following result: There is a positive constant \epsilon(n,\Lambda) such that if M^n is a simply connected compact K\ddot{a}hler manifold with sectional curvature bounded from above by \Lambda, diameter bounded from above by 1, and with holomorphic bisectional curvature H \geq -\epsilon(n,\Lambda), then M^n is diffeomorphic to the product M_1\times ... \times M_k, where each M_i is either a complex projective space or an irreducible K\ddot{a}hler-Hermitian symmetric space of rank \geq 2. This resolves a conjecture of F. Fang under the additional upper bound restrictions on sectional curvature and diameter.
