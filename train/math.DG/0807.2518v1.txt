The conformal geometry of spacelike surfaces in 4-dimensional Lorentzian space forms has been studied by the authors in a previous paper, where the so-called polar transform was introduced. Here it is shown that this transform preserves spacelike conformal isothermic surfaces. We relate this new transform with the known transforms (Darboux transform and spectral transform) of isothermic surfaces by establishing the permutability theorems.
