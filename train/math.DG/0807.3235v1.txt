All the connections, pure toward the nilpotent structure, are found. Examples of manifolds, for which the curvature tensor is pure or hybrid, are given. For a manifold of B-type a necessary and sufficient condition for purity of the curvature tensor is proved. It is verified that the conformal change of the metric of a B-manifold does not retain its purity.
