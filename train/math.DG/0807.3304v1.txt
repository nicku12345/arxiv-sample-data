In this note, we study non-linear gauge theories for principal bundles, where the structure group is replaced by a Lie groupoid. We follow the approach of Moerdijk-Mrcun and establish its relation with the existing physics literature. In particular, we derive a new formula for the gauge transformation which closely resembles and generalizes the classical formulas found in Yang Mills gauge theories.
