A foliation on a Riemannian manifold is hyperpolar if it admits a flat section, that is, a connected closed flat submanifold that intersects each leaf of the foliation orthogonally. In this article we classify the hyperpolar homogeneous foliations on every Riemannian symmetric space of noncompact type.
