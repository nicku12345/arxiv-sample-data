This article presents some methods to control the bottom of the spectrum of the Laplacian \lambda_0 on hyperbolic surfaces with infinite volume. Our first result bounds the \lambda_0 of a geometrically finite surface in terms of the geometry of its convex core. We then focus on infinite type periodic hyperbolic surfaces built by gluing copies of a geometrically finite surface with boundary according to the plan of an infinite graph. We control the \lambda_0 of the so-obtained infinite surfaces by constants coming from spectral properties of the building brick and combinatorial datae of the graph. We then use these methods to control the \lambda_0 of two other kind of infinite type hyperbolic surfaces : those admitting a splitting into bounded pieces, and some riemannian coverings.
