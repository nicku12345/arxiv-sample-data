An almost para-CR structure on a manifold M is given by a distribution HM \subset TM together with a field K \in \Gamma({\rm End}(HM)) of involutive endomorphisms of HM. If K satisfies an integrability condition, then (HM,K) is called a para-CR structure. The notion of maximally homogeneous para-CR structure of a semisimple type is given. A classification of such maximally homogeneous para-CR structures is given in terms of appropriate gradations of real semisimple Lie algebras.
