For odd dimensional Poincar\'e-Einstein manifolds (X^{n+1},g), we study the set of harmonic k-forms (for k<\ndemi) which are C^m (with m\in\nn) on the conformal compactification \bar{X} of X. This is infinite dimensional for small m but it becomes finite dimensional if m is large enough, and in one-to-one correspondence with the direct sum of the relative cohomology H^k(\bar{X},\pl\bar{X}) and the kernel of the Branson-Gover \cite{BG} differential operators (L_k,G_k) on the conformal infinity (\pl\bar{X},[h_0]). In a second time we relate the set of C^{n-2k+1}(\Lambda^k(\bar{X})) forms in the kernel of d+\delta_g to the conformal harmonics on the boundary in the sense of \cite{BG}, providing some sort of long exact sequence adapted to this setting. This study also provides another construction of Branson-Gover differential operators, including a parallel construction of the generalization of Q curvature for forms.
