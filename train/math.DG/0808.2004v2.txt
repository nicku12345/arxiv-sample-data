In trying to provide explicit deformations of quadrics the starting point of our investigation is to use Bianchi's link between real deformations of totally real regions of real paraboloids and various totally real forms of the sine-Gordon equation coupled with Bianchi's simple observation that the vacuum soliton of these totally real forms of the sine-Gordon equation provides precisely Peterson's deformations of such quadrics in order to derive explicit B\"{a}cklund transforms of Peterson's deformations of quadrics. Based also on Bianchi's approach of the B\"{a}cklund transformation for quadrics via common conjugate systems and in analogy to the solitons of the sine-Gordon equation corresponding at the level of the geometric picture to the solitons of the pseudo-sphere we propose a model for the solitons of quadrics.
