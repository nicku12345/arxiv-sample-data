Given a parallel calibration \phi \in \Omega^p(M) on a Riemannian manifold M, I prove that the \phi--critical submanifolds with nonzero critical value are minimal submanifolds. I also show that the \phi--critical submanifolds are precisely the integral manifolds of a \mathscr{C}^\infty(M)--linear subspace \sP \subset \Omega^p(M). In particular, the calibrated submanifolds are necessarily integral submanifolds of the system. (Examples of parallel calibrations include the special Lagrangian calibration on Calabi-Yau manifolds, (co)associative calibrations on G_2--manifolds, and the Cayley calibration on \tSpin(7)--manifolds.)
