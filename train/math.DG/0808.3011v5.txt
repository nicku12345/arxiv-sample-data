We consider operators L acting on functions on a Riemannian surface, \Sigma, of the form L = \Delta + V +a K.   Here \Delta is the Laplacian of \Sigma, V a non-negative potential on \Sigma, K the Gaussian curvature and a is a non-negative constant. Such operators L arise as the stability operator of \Sigma immersed in a Riemannian 3-manifold with constant mean curvature (for particular choices of V and a). We assume L is nonpositive acting on functions compactly supported on \Sigma and we obtain results in the spirit of some theorems of Ficher-Colbrie-Schoen, Colding-Minicozzi, and Castillon. We extend these theorems to a \leq 1/4. We obtain results on the conformal type of \Sigma and a distance (to the boundary) lemma.
