In this paper we study constant mean curvature surfaces \Sigma in a product space, \mathbb{M}^2\times \mathbb{R}, where \mathbb{M}^2 is a complete Riemannian manifold. We assume the angle function \nu = \meta{N}{\partial_t} does not change sign on \Sigma. We classify these surfaces according to the infimum c(\Sigma) of the Gaussian curvature of the projection of \Sigma.   When H \neq 0 and c(\Sigma)\geq 0, then \Sigma  is a cylinder over a complete curve with curvature 2H. If H=0 and c(\Sigma) \geq 0, then \Sigma must be a vertical plane or \Sigma is a slice \mathbb{M}^2 \times {t}, or \mathbb{M}^2 \equiv \mathbb{R}^2 with the flat metric and \Sigma is a tilted plane (after possibly passing to a covering space).   When c(\Sigma)<0 and H>\sqrt{-c(\Sigma)} /2, then \Sigma is a vertical cylinder over a complete curve of \mathbb{M}^2 of constant geodesic curvature 2H. This result is optimal.   We also prove a non-existence result concerning complete multi-graphs in \mathbb{M}^2\times \mathbb{R}, when c(\mathbb{M}^2)<0.
