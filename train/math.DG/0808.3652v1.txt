In this work the Isoperimetric Inequality for integral varifolds is used to obtain sharp estimates for the size of the set where the density quotient is small and to generalise Calder\'on's and Zygmund's theory of first order differentiability for functions in Lebesgue spaces from Lebesgue measure to integral varifolds.
