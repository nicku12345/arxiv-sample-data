We define the Poisson quasi-Nijenhuis structures with background on Lie algebroids and we prove that to any generalized complex structure on a Courant algebroid which is the double of a Lie algebroid is associated such a structure. We prove that any Lie algebroid with a Poisson quasi-Nijenhuis structure with background constitutes, with its dual, a quasi-Lie bialgebroid. We also prove that any pair (\pi,\omega) of a Poisson bivector and a 2-form induces a Poisson quasi-Nijenhuis structure with background and we observe that particular cases correspond to already known compatibilities between \pi and \omega.
