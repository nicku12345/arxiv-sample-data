We show that a Laplace isospectral family of two dimensional Riemannian orbifolds, sharing a lower bound on sectional curvature, contains orbifolds of only a finite number of orbifold category diffeomorphism types. We also show that orbifolds of only finitely many orbifold diffeomorphism types may arise in any collection of 2-orbifolds satisfying lower bounds on sectional curvature and volume, and an upper bound on diameter. An argument converting spectral data to geometric bounds shows that the first result is a consequence of the second.
