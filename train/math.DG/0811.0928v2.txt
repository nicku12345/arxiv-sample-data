In this paper we give necessary and sufficient conditions for spacelike and timelike curves in a conformally flat, quasi conformally flat and conformally symmetric 4-dimensional \textit{LP}-Sasakian manifold to be proper biharmonic. Also, we investigate proper biharmonic curves in the Lorentzian sphere S^{4}_{1}.
