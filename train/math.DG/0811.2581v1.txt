For a Lie group G and a closed Lie subgroup H\subset G, it is well known that the coset space G/H can be equipped with the structure of a manifold homogeneous under G and that any G-homogeneous manifold is isomorphic to one of this kind. An interesting problem is to find an analogue of this result in the case of supermanifolds.   In the classical setting, G is a real or a complex Lie group and G/H is a real and, respectively, a complex manifold. Now, if G is a real Lie supergroup and H\subset G is a closed Lie subsupergroup, there is a natural way to consider G/H as a supermanfold. Furthermore, any G-homogeneous real supermanifold can be obtained in this way, see \cite{Kostant}. The goal of this paper is to give a proof of this result in the complex case.
