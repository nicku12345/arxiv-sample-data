We prove the double bubble conjecture in the three-sphere S^3 and hyperbolic three-space H^3 in the cases where we can apply Hutchings theory: 1) in S^3, each enclosed volume and the complement occupy at least 10% of the volume of S^3; 2) in H^3, the smaller volume is at least 85% that of the larger. A balancing argument and asymptotic analysis reduce the problem in S^3 and H^3 to some computer checking. The computer analysis has been designed and fully implemented for both spaces.
