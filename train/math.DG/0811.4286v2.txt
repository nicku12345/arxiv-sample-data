We study forgetful maps between Deligne-Mostow moduli spaces of weighted points on P^1, and classify the forgetful maps that extend to a map of orbifolds between the stable completions. The cases where this happens include the Livn\'e fibrations and the Mostow/Toledo maps between complex hyperbolic surfaces. They also include a retraction of a 3-dimensional ball quotient onto one of its 1-dimensional totally geodesic complex submanifolds.
