We construct a generalization of Courant algebroids which are classified by the third cohomology group H^3(A,V), where A is a Lie Algebroid, and V is an A-module. We see that both Courant algebroids and \mathcal{E}^1(M) structures are examples of them. Finally we introduce generalized CR structures on a manifold, which are a generalization of generalized complex structures, and show that every CR structure and contact structure is an example of a generalized CR structure.
