In this paper, we prove that on every Finsler n-sphere (S^n, F) for n\ge 6 with reversibility \lambda and flag curvature K satisfying (\frac{\lambda}{\lambda+1})^2<K\le 1, either there exist infinitely many prime closed geodesics or there exist [\frac{n}{2}]-2 closed geodesics possessing irrational average indices. If in addition the metric is bumpy, then there exist n-3 closed geodesics possessing irrational average indices provided the number of closed geodesics is finite.
