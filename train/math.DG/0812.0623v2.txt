We give an estimate of the mean curvature of a complete submanifold lying inside a closed cylinder B(r)\times\R^{\ell} in a product Riemannian manifold N^{n-\ell}\times\R^{\ell}. It follows that a complete hypersurface of given constant mean curvature lying inside a closed circular cylinder in Euclidean space cannot be proper if the circular base is of sufficiently small radius. In particular, any possible counterexample to a conjecture of Calabion complete minimal hypersurfaces cannot be proper. As another application of our method, we derive a result about the stochastic incompleteness of submanifolds with sufficiently small mean curvature.
