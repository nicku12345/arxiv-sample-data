For every diffeomorphism \varphi:M\to N between 3--dimensional Riemannian manifolds M and N there are in general locally two 2--dimensional distributions D_{\pm} such that \varphi is conformal on both of them. We state necessary and sufficient conditions for a distribution to be one of D_{\pm}. These are algebraic conditions expressed in terms of the self-adjoint and positive definite operator (\varphi_{\ast})^*\varphi_{\ast}. We investigate integrability condition of D_+ and D_-. We also show that it is possible to choose coordinate systems in which leafwise conformal diffeomorphism is holomorphic on leaves.
