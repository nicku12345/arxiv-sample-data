In this paper two Poisson structures on the moduli space of hyperbolic surfaces with conical points are compared: the Weil-Petersson one and the \eta coming from the representation variety. We show that they are multiple of each other, if the angles do not exceed 2\pi. Moreover, we exhibit an explicit formula for \eta in terms of hyperbolic lengths of a suitable system of arcs.
