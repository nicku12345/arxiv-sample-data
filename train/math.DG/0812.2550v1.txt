We explicitly compute the diffeomorphism group of several types of linear foliations (with dense leaves) on the torus T^n, n\geq 2, namely codimension one foliations, flows, and the so-called non-quadratic foliations. We show in particular that non-quadratic foliations are rigid, in the sense that they do not admit transverse diffeomorphisms other than \pm \id and translations. The computation is an application of a general formula that we prove for the diffeomorphism group of any Lie foliation with dense leaves on a compact manifold. Our results generalize those of P. Donato and P. Iglesias for T^2, P. Iglesias and G. Lachaud for codimension one foliations on T^n, n\geq 2, and B. Herrera for transcendent foliations. The theoretical setting of the paper is that of J. M. Souriau's diffeological spaces.
