Given a hypersurface M of null scalar curvature in the unit sphere \mathbb{S}^n, n\ge 4, such that its second fundamental form has rank greater than 2, we construct a singular scalar-flat hypersurface in \Rr^{n+1} as a normal graph over a truncated cone generated by M. Furthermore, this graph is 1-stable if the cone is strictly 1-stable.
