We consider several transformation groups of a locally conformally K\"ahler manifold and discuss their inter-relations. Among other results, we prove that all conformal vector fields on a compact Vaisman manifold which is neither locally conformally hyperk\"ahler nor a diagonal Hopf manifold are Killing, holomorphic and that all affine vector fields with respect to the minimal Weyl connection of a locally conformally K\"ahler manifold which is neither Weyl-reducible nor locally conformally hyperk\"ahler are holomorphic and conformal
