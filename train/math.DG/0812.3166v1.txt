In this paper we study the second fundamental form of translation surfaces in E3. We give a non-existence result for polynomial translation surfaces in E3 with vanishing second Gaussian curvature KII. We classify those translation surfaces for which KII and H are proportional. Finally we obtain that there are no II-minimal translation surfaces in the Euclidean 3-space.
