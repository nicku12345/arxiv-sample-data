For a singular Riemannian foliation whose leaves are properly embedded, we show in the first part of this article the existence of global tubular neighbourhoods, and we develop a global description of the foliation as stratification by types of leaves.   The second part deals with the further restriction to a foliation without horizontal conjugate points, introduced by Lytchak and Thorbergsson, which in the special case of an isometric group action equals the concept of variationally completeness. Therefrom, we deduce a global geometric description -- the focal points of the leaves are exactly the singular points -- as well as a topological one: tautness of the leaves.
