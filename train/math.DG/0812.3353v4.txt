Theorem A. Let M^n denote a closed Riemannian manifold with nonpositive sectional curvature and let \tilde M^n be the universal cover of M^n with the lifted metric. Suppose that the universal cover \tilde M^n contains no totally geodesic embedded Euclidean plane \mathbb{R}^2 (i.e., M^n is a visibility manifold). Then Gromov's simplicial volume \| M^n \| is non-zero. Consequently, M^n is non-collapsible while keeping Ricci curvature bounded from below. More precisely, if Ric_g \ge -(n-1), then vol(M^n, g) \ge \frac{1}{(n-1)^n n!} \| M^n \| > 0.   Theorem B. (Perelman) Let M^3 be a closed a-spherical 3-manifold (K(\pi, 1)-space) with the fundamental group \Gamma. Suppose that \Gamma contains no subgroups isomorphic to \mathbb{Z}\oplus \mathbb{Z}. Then M^3 is diffeomorphic to a compact quotient of real hyperbolic space \mathbb{H}^3, i.e., M^3 \equiv \mathbb{H}^3/\Gamma. Consequently, MinVol(M^3) \ge {1/24}\| M^3 \| > 0.   Minimal volume and simplicial norm of all other compact 3-manifolds without boundary and {\it singular} spaces will also be discussed.
