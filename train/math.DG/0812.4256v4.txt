We introduce the notion of K\"ahler manifolds that are almost Einstein and we define a generalized mean curvature vector field along submanifolds in them. We prove that Lagrangian submanifolds remain Lagrangian, when deformed in direction of the generalized mean curvature vector field. For a K\"ahler manifold that is almost Einstein, and which in addition has a trivial canonical bundle, we show that the generalized mean curvature vector field of a Lagrangian submanifold is the dual vector field associated to the Lagrangian angle.
