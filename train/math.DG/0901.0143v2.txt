Let (X_0,\mathcal{F}_0)  be a compact manifold with boundary endowed with a foliation \mathcal{F}_0 which is assumed to be measured and transverse to the boundary. We denote by \Lambda a holonomy invariant transverse measure on (X_0,\mathcal{F}_0)  and by \mathcal{R}_0 the equivalence relation of the foliation. Let (X,\mathcal{F}) be the corresponding manifold with cylindrical end and extended foliation with equivalence relation \mathcal{R}. In the first part of this work we prove a formula for the L^2-\Lambda index of a longitudinal Dirac-type operator D^{\mathcal{F}} on X in the spirit of Alain Connes' non commutative geometry   ind_{L^2,\Lambda}(D^{\mathcal{F},+}) = <\hat{A}(T\mathcal{F})Ch(E/S),C_\Lambda> + 1/2[\eta_\Lambda(D^{\mathcal{F}_\partial}) - h^+_{\Lambda} + h^-_{\Lambda}].
