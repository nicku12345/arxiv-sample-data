The classical concept of affine locally symmetric spaces allows a generalization for various geometric structures on a smooth manifold. We remind the notion of symmetry for parabolic geometries and we summarize the known facts for |1|--graded parabolic geometries and for almost Grassmannian structures, in particular. As an application of two general constructions with parabolic geometries, we present an example of non--flat Grassmannian symmetric space. Next we observe there is a distinguished torsion--free affine connection preserving the Grassmannian structure so that, with respect to this connection, the Grassmannian symmetric space is an affine symmetric space in the classical sense.
