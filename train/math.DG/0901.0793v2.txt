The topology of the Hausdorff leaf spaces (HLS) for a codim-1 foliation is the main topic of this paper. At the beginning, the connection between the Hausdorff leaf space and a warped foliations is examined. Next, the author describes the HLS for all basic constructions of foliations such as transversal and tangential gluing, spinning, turbulization, and suspension. Finally, it is shown that the HLS for any codim-1 foliation on a compact Riemannian manifold is isometric to a finite connected metric graph. In addition, the author proves that for any finite connected metric graph G there exists a compact foliated Riemannian manifold (M,F,g) with codim-1 foliation such that the Hausdorff leaf space for F is isometric to G. Finally, the necessary and sufficient condition for warped foliations of codim-1 to converge to HLS(F) is given.
