We show that integration over a G-manifold M can be reduced to integration over a minimal section \Sigma with respect to an induced weighted measure and integration over a homogeneous space G/N. We relate our formula to integration formulae for polar actions and calculate some weight functions. In case of a compact Lie group acting on itself via conjugation, we obtain a classical result of Hermann Weyl. Our formula allows to view almost arbitrary isometric group actions as generalized random matrix ensembles. We also establish a reductive decomposition of Killing fields with respect to a minimal section.
