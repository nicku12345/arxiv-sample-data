We consider a unit speed curve \alpha in Euclidean four-dimensional space E^4 and denote the Frenet frame by \{T,N,B_1,B_2\}. We say that \alpha is a slant helix if its principal normal vector N makes a constant angle with a fixed direction U. In this work we give different characterizations of such curves in terms of their curvatures.
