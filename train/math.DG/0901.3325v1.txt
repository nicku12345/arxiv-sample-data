We consider a unit speed curve \alpha in Euclidean n-dimensional space E^n and denote the Frenet frame by \{v_1,...,v_n\}. We say that \alpha is a cylindrical helix if its tangent vector v_1 makes a constant angle with a fixed direction U. In this work we give different characterizations of such curves in terms of their curvatures.
