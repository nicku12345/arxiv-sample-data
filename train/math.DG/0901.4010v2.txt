We investigate the finiteness structure of a complete non-compact n-dimensional Riemannian manifold M whose radial curvature at a base point of M is bounded from below by that of a non-compact von Mangoldt surface of revolution with its total curvature greater than \pi. We show, as our main theorem, that all Busemann functions on M are exhaustions, and that there exists a compact subset of M such that the compact set contains all critical points for any Busemann function on M. As corollaries by the main theorem, M has finite topological type, and the isometry group of M is compact.
