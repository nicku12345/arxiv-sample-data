In 1968, Simons introduced the concept of index for hypersurfaces immersed into the Euclidean sphere S^{n+1}. Intuitively, the index measures the number of independent directions in which a given hypersurface fails to minimize area. The earliest results regarding the index focused on the case of minimal hypersurfaces. Many such results established lower bounds for the index. More recently, however, mathematicians have generalized these results to hypersurfaces with constant mean curvature. In this paper, we consider hypersurfaces of constant mean curvature immersed into the sphere and give lower bounds for the index under new assumptions about the immersed manifold.
