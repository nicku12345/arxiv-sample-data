Recently the present authors introduced a general class of Finsler connections which leads to a smart representation of connection theory in Finsler geometry and yields to a classification of Finsler connections into the three classes. Here the properties of one of these classes namely the Berwald-type connections which contains Berwald and Chern(Rund) connections as a special case is studied. It is proved among the other that the hv-curvature of these connections vanishes if and only if the Finsler space is a Berwald one. Some applications of this connection is discussed.
