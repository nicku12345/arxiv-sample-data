In [5], P. Lecomte conjectured the existence of a natural and conformally invariant quantization. In [7], we gave a proof of this theorem thanks to the theory of Cartan connections. In this paper, we give an explicit formula for the natural and conformally invariant quantization of trace-free symbols thanks to the method used in [7] and to tools already used in [8] in the projective setting. This formula is extremely similar to the one giving the natural and projectively invariant quantization in [8].
