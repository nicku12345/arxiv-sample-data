We prove that any asymptotically locally Euclidean scalar-flat K\"ahler 4-orbifold whose isometry group contains a 2-torus is isometric, up to an orbifold covering, to a quaternionic-complex quotient of a k-dimensional quaternionic vector space by a (k-1)-torus. In order to do so, we first prove that any compact anti-self-dual 4-orbifold with positive Euler characteristic whose isometry group contains a 2-torus is conformally equivalent, up to an orbifold covering, to a quaternionic quotient of k-dimensional quaternionic projective space by a (k-1)-torus.
