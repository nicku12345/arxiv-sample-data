In this paper we describe all rotation H-hypersurfaces in H^n \times R and use them as barriers to prove existence and characterization of certain vertical H-graphs and to give symmetry and uniqueness results for compact H-hypersurfaces whose boundary is one or two parallel submanifolds in slices. We also describe examples of translation H-hypersurfaces in H^n \times R. For n>2 we obtain a complete embedded translation hypersurface generated by a compact, simple, strictly convex curve. When 0 < H < \frac{n-1}{n} we obtain a complete non-entire vertical graph over the non-mean convex domain bounded by an equidistant hypersurface taking infinite boundary value data and infinite asymptotic boundary value data.
