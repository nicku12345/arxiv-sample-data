We show that a para-Hermitian algebraic curvature model satisfies the para-Gray identity if and only if it is geometrically realizable by a para-Hermitian manifold. This requires extending the Tricerri-Vanhecke curvature decomposition to the para-Hermitian setting. Additionally, the geometric realization can be chosen to have constant scalar curvature and constant *-scalar curvature.
