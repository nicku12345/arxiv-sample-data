This is a survey of the theory of complex projective (CP^1) structures on compact surfaces. After some preliminary discussion and definitions, we concentrate on three main topics:   (1) Using the Schwarzian derivative to parameterize the moduli space   (2) Thurston's parameterization of the moduli space using grafting   (3) Holonomy representations of CP^1 structures   We also discuss some results comparing the two parameterizations of the space of projective structures and relating these parameterizations to the holonomy map.
