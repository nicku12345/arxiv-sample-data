We study complete Riemannian manifolds satisfying the equation Ric+\nabla^2 f-\frac{1}{m}df\otimes df=0 by studying the associated PDE \Delta_f f + m\mu e^{2f/m}=0 for \mu\leq 0. By developing a gradient estimate for f, we show there are no nonconstant solutions. We then apply this to show that there are no nontrivial Ricci flat warped products with fibers which have nonpositive Einstein constant. We also show that for nontrivial steady gradient Ricci solitons, the quantity R+|\nabla f|^2 is a positive constant.
