We consider the mean curvature flow of entire Lagrangian graphs with Lipschitz continuous initial data. Assuming only a certain bound on the Lipschitz norm of an initial entire Lagrangian graph in \R^{2n}, we show that the parabolic equation \eqref{PMA} for the Lagrangian potential has a longtime solution which is smooth for all positive time and satisfies uniform estimates away from time t=0. In particular, under the mean curvature flow the graph immediately becomes smooth and the solution exists for all time such that the second fundamental form decays uniformly to 0 on the graph as t\to \infty. Our assumption on the Lipschitz norm is equivalent to the assumption that the underlying Lagrangian potential u is uniformly convex with its Hessian bounded in L^\infty. We apply this result to prove a Bernstein type theorem for translating solitons, namely that if such an entire Lagrangian graph is a smooth translating soliton, then it must be a flat plane. We also prove convergence of the evolving graphs under additional conditions.
