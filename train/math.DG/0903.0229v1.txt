The goal of this paper, using lifting theory it is to produce almost paracomplex struc- tures on the tangent bundle of almost Lorentzian r-paracontact manifold endowed with almost Lorentzian r-paracontact structure. Finally, we discuss the effect over dynamics systems of the produced geometrical structures.
