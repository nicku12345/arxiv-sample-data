The authors give a short survey of previous results on \delta-homogeneous Riemannian manifolds, forming a new proper subclass of geodesic orbit spaces with non-negative sectional curvature, which properly includes the class of all normal homogeneous Riemannian manifolds. As a continuation and an application of these results, they prove that the family of all compact simply connected indecomposable \delta-homogeneous Riemannian manifolds with positive Euler characteristic, which are not normal homogeneous, consists exactly of all generalized flag manifolds Sp(l)/U(1)\cdot Sp(l-1)=\mathbb{C}P^{2l-1}, l\geq 2, supplied with invariant Riemannian metrics of positive sectional curvature with the pinching constants (the ratio of the minimal sectional curvature to the maximal one) in the open interval (1/16, 1/4). This implies very unusual geometric properties of the adjoint representation of Sp(l), l\geq 2. Some unsolved questions are suggested.
