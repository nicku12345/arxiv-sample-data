Let m>1 and n>1 be any pair of integers. In this paper we prove that if H is between the numbers \cot(\frac{\pi}{m}) and b_{m,n}=\frac{(m^2-2)\sqrt{n-1}}{n\sqrt{m^2-1}}, then, there exists a non isoparametric, compact embedded hypersurface in S^{n+1} with constant mean curvature H that admits the group O(n)x Z_m in their group of isometries, here O(n) is the set of n x n orthogonal matrices and Z_m are the integers mod m. When m=2 and H is close to the boundary value 0, the hypersurfaces look like two very close n-dimensional spheres with two catenoid necks attached, similar to constructions made by Kapouleas. When m>2 and H is close to \cot(\frac{\pi}{m}), the hypersurfaces look like a necklets made out of m spheres with (m+1) catenoid necks attached, similar to constructions made by Butscher and Pacard. In general, when H is close to b_{m,n} the hypersurface is close to an isoparametric hypersurface with the same mean curvature. As a consequence of the expression of these bounds for H, we have that every H different from 0,\pm\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} can be realized as the mean curvature of a non isoparametric CMC surface in S^3. For hyperbolic spaces we prove that every non negative H can be realized as the mean curvature of an embedded CMC hypersurface in H^{n+1}, moreover we prove that when H>1 this hypersurface admits the group O(n)\times Z in its group of isometries. Here Z are the integer numbers. As a corollary of the properties proven for these hypersurfaces, for any n> 5, we construct non isoparametric compact minimal hypersurfaces in S^{n+1} which cone in R^{n+2} is stable. Also, we will prove that the stability index of every non isoparametric minimal hypersurface with two principal curvatures in S^{n+1} is greater than 2n+5.
