In this paper, we find all constant slope surfaces in the Euclidean 3-space, namely those surfaces for which the position vector of a point of the surface makes constant angle with the normal at the surface in that point. These surfaces could be thought as the bi-dimensional analogue of the generalized helices. Some pictures are drawn by using the parametric equations we found.
