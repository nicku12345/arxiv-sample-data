In this paper we extend a recent result of Collin-Rosenberg ({\it a solution to the minimal surface equation in the Euclidean disc has radial limits almost everywhere}) to a large class of differential operators in Divergence form. Moreover, we construct an example (in the spirit of \cite{CR2}) of a minimal graph in \mr, where \m is a Hadamard surface, over a geodesic disc which has finite radial limits in a mesure zero set.
