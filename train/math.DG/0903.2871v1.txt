Let (M,\mathcal{F}) be a foliated manifold. We prove that there is a canonical isomorphism between the complex of base-like forms \Omega^*_b(M,\mathcal{F}) of the foliation and the "De Rham complex" of the space of leaves M/\mathcal{F} when considered as a "diffeological" quotient. Consequently, the two corresponding cohomology groups H^*_b(M,\mathcal{F}) and H^*(M/\mathcal{F}) are isomorphic.
