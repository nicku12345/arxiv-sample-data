We show that the number of entire maximal graphs with finitely many singular points that are conformally equivalent is a universal constant that depends only on the number of singularities, namely 2^ for graphs with n+1 singularities. We also give an explicit description of the family of entire maximal graphs with a finite number of singularities all of them lying on a plane orthogonal to the limit normal vector at infinity.
