Let \psi:\M \to \SH be an isometric immersion of codimension 1, then there exist symmetric (1,1)-tensors S and f, a tangent vector field U and a smooth function \lambda on \M that satisfy the compatibility equations of \SH. In this paper, we will deal with the converse problem: "Given a Riemannian manifold \M with symmetric (1,1)-tensors S and f, tangent vector field U and smooth function \lambda satisfying the conditions mentioned above, can \M then be isometrically immersed in \SH in such a way that (g,S,f,U,\lambda) is realized as the induced structure?".
