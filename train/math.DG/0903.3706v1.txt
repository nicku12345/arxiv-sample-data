Let \Gamma \stackrel{i}{\hookrightarrow} L be a lattice in the real simple Lie group L. If L is of rank at least 2 (respectively locally isomorphic to Sp(n,1)) any unbounded morphism \rho: \Gamma \longrightarrow G into a simple real Lie group G essentially extends to a Lie morphism \rho_L: L \longrightarrow G (Margulis's superrigidity theorem, respectively Corlette's theorem). In particular any such morphism is infinitesimally, thus locally, rigid. On the other hand, for L=SU(n,1), even morphisms of the form \rho : \Gamma \stackrel{i}{\hookrightarrow} L \longrightarrow G are not infinitesimally rigid in general. Almost nothing is known about their local rigidity. In this paper we prove that any {\em cocompact} lattice \Gamma in SU(n,1) is essentially locally rigid (while in general not infinitesimally rigid) in the quaternionic groups Sp(n,1), SU(2n,2) or SO(4n,4) (for the natural sequence of embeddings SU(n,1) \subset Sp(n,1) \subset SU(2n,2) \subset SO(4n,4)).
