We survey some of the recent progress on complete gradient shrinking Ricci solitons, including the classifications in dimension three and asymptotic behavior of potential functions as well as volume growths of geodesic balls in higher dimensions. This article is written for the conference proceedings dedicated to Yau's 60th birthday.
