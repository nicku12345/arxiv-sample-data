We consider a surface \Sigma of genus g \geq 3, either closed or with exactly one puncture. The mapping class group \Gamma of \Sigma acts symplectically on the abelian moduli space M = \Hom(\pi_1(\Sigma), U(1)) = \Hom(H_1(\Sigma),U(1)), and hence both L^2(M) and C^\infty(M) are modules over \Gamma. In this paper, we prove that both the cohomology groups H^1(\Gamma, L^2(M)) and H^1(\Gamma, C^\infty(M)) vanish.
