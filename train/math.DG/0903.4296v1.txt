In the recent paper \cite{DGNP} we have proved that the only stable C^2 minimal surfaces in the first Heisenberg group \Hn which are graphs over some plane and have empty characteristic locus must be vertical planes. This result represents a sub-Riemannian version of the celebrated theorem of Bernstein.   In this paper we extend the result in \cite{DGNP} to C^2 complete embedded minimal surfaces in \mathbb H^1 with empty characteristic locus. We prove that every such a surface without boundary must be a vertical plane.
