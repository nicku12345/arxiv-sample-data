Let M be a smooth manifold equipped with a conformal structure, E[w] the space of densities with the the conformal weight w and D_{w,w+\de} the space of differential operators from E[w] to E[w+\delta]. Conformal quantization Q is a right inverse of the principle symbol map on D_{w,w+\delta} such that Q is conformally invariant and exists for all w. This is known to exists for generic values of \delta. We give explicit formulae for Q for all \delta out of the set of critical weights. We provide a simple description of this set and conjecture its minimality.
