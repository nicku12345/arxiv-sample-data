In this note, we study the Koszul-Brylinski homology of holomorphic Poisson manifolds. We show that it is isomorphic to the cohomology of a certain smooth complex Lie algebroid with values in the Evens-Lu-Weinstein duality module. As a consequence, we prove that the Evens-Lu-Weinstein pairing on Koszul-Brylinski homology is nondegenerate. Finally we compute the Koszul-Brylinski homology for Poisson structures on \CP^1\times\CP^1.
