Suppose TM\setminus \{0\} and T\widetilde M\setminus\{0\} are slashed tangent bundles of two smooth manifolds M and \widetilde M, respectively. In this paper we characterize those diffeomorphisms F\colon TM\setminus\{0\} \to T\widetilde M\setminus\{0\} that can be written as F = (D\phi)|_{TM\setminus\{0\}} for a diffeomorphism \phi\colon M\to \wt M. When F = (D\phi)|_{TM\setminus\{0\}} one say that F \emph{descends}. If M is equipped with two sprays, we use the characterization to derive sufficient conditions that imply that F descends to a totally geodesic map. Specializing to Riemann geometry we also obtain sufficient conditions for F to descent to an isometry.
