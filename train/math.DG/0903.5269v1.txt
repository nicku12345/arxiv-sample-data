We present an algebraic investigation of generalized and equiaffine curvature tensors in a given pseudo-Euclidean vector space and study different orthogonal, irreducible decompositions in analogy to the known decomposition of algebraic curvature tensors. We apply the decomposition results to characterize geometric properties of Codazzi structures and relative hypersurfaces; particular emphasis is on projectively flat structures.
