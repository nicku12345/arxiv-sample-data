We show that among the Euclidean submanifolds with codimension two the ones of rank two that are parabolic but nonruled are isometrically rigid. This generalizes the result in [10] that these submanifolds are genuinely rigid. In addition, we give a parametric classifications of all parabolic submanifolds.
