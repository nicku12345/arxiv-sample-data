The goal of this paper is to classify parametrically parabolic submanifolds in any codimension. First, we describe the ones that are ruled and show that they are the only parabolic submanifolds that admit an isometric immersion as a hypersurface. Then, we classify the nonruled ones by two different means. In fact, we provide the polar and bipolar parametrizations, each of which is associated to a parabolic surface and a function on the surface which satisfies a parabolic differential equation. To conclude, we describe the structure of the singular set of the nonruled parabolic submanifolds.
