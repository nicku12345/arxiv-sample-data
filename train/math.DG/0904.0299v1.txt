In this paper, we study n-dimensional hypersurfaces with constant m^{\text{th}} mean curvature in a unit sphere S^{n+1}(1) and construct many compact nontrivial embedded hypersurfaces with constant m^{\text{th}} mean curvature H_m>0 in S^{n+1}(1), for 1\leq m\leq n-1. In particular, if the 4^{\text{th}} mean curvature H_4 takes value between \dfrac{1}{(\tan \frac{\pi}{k})^4} and \dfrac{k^4-4}{n(n-4)} for any integer k\geq3, then there exists an n-dimensional (n\geq 5) compact nontrivial embedded hypersurface with constant H_4 in S^{n+1}(1).
