In this paper, we define a rectifying spacelike curve in the Minkowski space-time E_1^4 as a curve whose position vector always lies in orthogonal complement N^{\bot} of its principal normal vector field N. In particular, we study the rectifying spacelike curves in E_1^4 and characterize such curves in terms of their curvature functions.
