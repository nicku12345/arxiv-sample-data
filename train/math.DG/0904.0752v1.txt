Let (M^n,g), n \ge 4, be a compact simply-connected Riemannian manifold with nonnegative isotropic curvature. Given 0<l\le L, we prove that there exists \eps = \eps (l,L,n) satisfying the following: If the scalar curvature s of g satisfies  l \le s \le L  and the Einstein tensor satisfies  | Ric - \frac {s}{n}g | \le \eps then M is diffeomorphic to a symmetric space of compact type.   This is a smooth analogue of the result of S. Brendle that a compact Einstein manifold with nonnegative isotropic curvature is isometric to a locally symmetric space.
