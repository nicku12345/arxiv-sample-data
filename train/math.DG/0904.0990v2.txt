Let M^n\subset\mathbb R^{n+1} be the graph of a C^2-real valued function defined in a closed ball of \mathbb R^n. In this work, we obtain upper bounds for \inf_M|H| and \inf_M|R|, where H and R are, respectively, the mean curvature and the scalar curvature of M^n, generalizing estimates given by Heinz in the case n=2 [Math. Annalen 129, 451-454, 1955]. Under the assumption that M^n has negative Ricci curvature, we also obtain an upper bound for \inf_M|A|, where |A| is the length of the second fundamental form. As a consequence of this latter estimate one obtains that \inf |A|=0 for all entire graphs with negative Ricci curvature in Euclidean space. This gives a partial answer to a question raised by Smith-Xavier [Invent. Math. 90, 443-450, 1987].
