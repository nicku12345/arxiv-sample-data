This paper gives some examples of hypersurfaces \phi_t(M^n) evolving in time with speed determined by functions of the normal curvatures in an (n+1)-dimensional hyperbolic manifold; we emphasize the case of flow by harmonic mean curvature. The examples converge to a totally geodesic submanifold of any dimension from 1 to n, and include cases which exist for infinite time. Convergence to a point was studied by Andrews, and only occurs in finite time. For dimension n=2, the destiny of any harmonic mean curvature flow is strongly influenced by the genus of the surface M^2.
