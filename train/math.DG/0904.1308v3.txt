In this paper we prove that every definable set has a definable triangulation which is locally Lipschitz and weakly bi-Lipschitz on the natural simplicial stratification of the simplicial complex. We also distinguish a class T of regularity conditions and give a universal construction of a definable triangulation with a T condition of a definable set. This class includes the Whitney (B) condition and the Verdier condition.
