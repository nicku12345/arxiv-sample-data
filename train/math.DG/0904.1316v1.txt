In this paper we describe the notion of a weak lipschitzianity of a mapping on a C^{q} stratification. We also distinguish a class of regularity conditions that are in some sense invariant under definable, locally Lipschitz and weakly bi-Lipschitz homeomorphisms. This class includes the Whitney (B) condition and the Verdier condition.
