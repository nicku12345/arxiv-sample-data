In this paper we classify certain special ruled surfaces in \R^3 under the general theorem of characterization of constant angle surfaces. We study the tangent developable and conical surfaces from the point of view the constant angle property. Moreover, the natural extension to normal and binormal constant angle surfaces is given.
