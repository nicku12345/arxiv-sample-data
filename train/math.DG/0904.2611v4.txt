We investigate parallel submanifolds of a Riemannian symmetric space N. The special case of a symmetric submanifold has been investigated by many authors before and is well understood. We observe that there is an intrinsic property of the second fundamental form which distinguishes full symmetric submanifolds from arbitrary full parallel submanifolds of N, usually called "1-fullness of M". Furthermore, for every parallel submanifold M of N we consider the pullback bundle TN|M with its induced connection, which admits a distinguished parallel subbundle osc M, usually called the "second osculating bundle of M". If M is a complete parallel submanifold of N, then we can describe the corresponding holonomy Lie algebra of osc M by means of the second fundamental form of M and the curvature tensor of N at the origin. If moreover N is simply connected and M is even a full symmetric submanifold of N, then we will calculate the holonomy Lie algebra of TN|M in an explicit form.
