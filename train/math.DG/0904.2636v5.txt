We consider parallel submanifolds M of a Riemannian symmetric space N and study the question whether M is extrinsically homogeneous in N\,, i.e.\ whether there exists a subgroup of the isometry group of N which acts transitively on M\,. First, given a "2-jet" (W,b) at some point p\in N (i.e. W\subset T_pN is a linear space and b:W\times W\to W^\bot is a symmetric bilinear form)\,, we derive necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of a parallel submanifold with extrinsically homogeneous tangent holonomy bundle which passes through p and whose 2-jet at p is given by (W,b)\,. Second, we focus our attention on complete, (intrinsically) {\em irreducible} parallel submanifolds of N\,. Provided that N is of compact or non-compact type, we establish the extrinsic homogeneity of every complete, irreducible parallel submanifold of N whose dimension is at least 3 and which is not contained in any flat of N\,.
