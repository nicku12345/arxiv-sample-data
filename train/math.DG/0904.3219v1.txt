The article gives a necessary and sufficient condition for a Frobenius manifold to be a CDV-structure. We show that there exists a positive definite CDV-structure on any semi-simple Frobenius manifold. We also compare three natural connections on a CDV-structure and conclude that the underlying Hermitian manifold of a non-trivial CDV-structure is not a Kahler manifold. Finally, we compute the harmonic potential of a harmonic Frobenius manifolds.
