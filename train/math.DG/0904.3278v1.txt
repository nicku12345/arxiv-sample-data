We construct an explicit scheme to associate to any potential symbol an operator acting between sections of natural bundles (associated to irreducible representations) for a so-called AHS-structure. Outside of a finite set of critical (or resonant) weights, this procedure gives rise to a quantization, which is intrinsic to this geometric structure. In particular, this provides projectively and conformally equivariant quantizations for arbitrary symbols on general (curved) projective and conformal structures.
