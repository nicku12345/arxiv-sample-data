In this paper we introduce a local approach for the study of maximal surfaces immersed into a Lorentzian product space of the form M^2\times R_1, where M^2 is a connected Riemannian surface and M^2\times R_1 is endowed with the product Lorentzian metric. Specifically, we establish a local integral inequality for the squared norm of the second fundamental form of the surface, which allows us to derive an alternative proof of our Calabi-Bernstein theorem given in \cite{AA}.
