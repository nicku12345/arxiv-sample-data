Tubular neighborhoods play an important role in differential topology. We have applied these constructions to geometry of almost Hermitian manifolds. At first, we consider deformations of tensor structures on a normal tubular neighborhood of a submanifold in a Riemannian manifold.Further, an almost hyperHermitian structure has been constructed on the tangent bundle TM with help of the Riemannian connection of an almost Hermitian structure on a manifold M then, we consider an embedding of the almost Hermitian manifold M in the corresponding normal tubular neighborhood of the null section in the tangent bundle TM equipped with the deformed almost hyperHermitian structure of the special form.   As a result,we have obtained that any smooth manifold M of dimension n can be embedded as a totally geodesic submanifold in a Kaehlerian manifold of dimension 2n and in a hyperKaehlerian manifold of dimension 4n.
