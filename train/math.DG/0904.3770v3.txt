This paper provides a characterization of homogeneous curves on a geometric flag manifold which are geodesic with respect to any invariant metric. We call such curves homogeneous equigeodesics. We also characterize homogeneous equigeodesics whose associated Killing field is closed, hence, the corresponding geodesics is closed.
