We study focal points and Maslov index of a horizontal geodesic \gamma:I\to M in the total space of a semi-Riemannian submersion \pi:M\to B by determining an explicit relation with the corresponding objects along the projected geodesic \pi\circ\gamma:I\to B in the base space. We use this result to calculate the focal Maslov index of a (spacelike) geodesic in a stationary space-time which is orthogonal to a timelike Killing vector field.
