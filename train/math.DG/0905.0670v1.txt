A constant angle surface in Minkowski space is a spacelike surface whose unit normal vector field makes a constant hyperbolic angle with a fixed timelike vector. In this work we study and classify these surfaces. In particular, we show that they are flat. Next we prove that a tangent developable surface (resp. cylinder, cone) is a constant angle surface if and only if the generating curve is a helix (resp. a straight-line, a circle).
