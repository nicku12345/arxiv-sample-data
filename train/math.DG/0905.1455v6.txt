In a general and non metrical framework, we introduce the class of CR quaternionic manifolds containing the class of quaternionic manifolds, whilst in dimension three it particularizes to, essentially, give the conformal manifolds. We show that these manifolds have a rich natural Twistor Theory and, along the way, we obtain a heaven space construction for quaternionic manifolds.
