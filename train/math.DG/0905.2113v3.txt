The geometry and topology of complete nonorientable maximal surfaces with lightlike singularities in the Lorentz-Minkowski 3-space are studied. Some topological congruence formulae for surfaces of this kind are obtained. As a consequence, some existence and uniqueness results for maximal Moebius strips and maximal Klein bottles with one end are proved.
