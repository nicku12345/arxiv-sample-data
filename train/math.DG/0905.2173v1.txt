Petr Novotn\'y and Ji\v{r}\'l Hrivn\'ak \cite{Nov} investigated generalize the concept of Lie derivations via certain complex parameters and obtained various Lie and Jordan operator algebras as well as two one- parametric sets of linear operators. Moreover, they established the structure and properties of (\alpha,\beta,\gamma)-derivations of Lie algebras. We say a functional equation (\xi) is stable if any function g satisfying the equation (\xi) {\it approximately} is near to true solution of (\xi). In the present paper, we investigate the stability of (\alpha,\beta,\gamma)-derivations on Lie C^*-algebras associated with the following functional equation f(\frac{x_2-x_1}{3})+f(\frac{x_1-3 x_3}{3})+ f(\frac{3x_1+3x_3-x_2}{3})=f(x_1). }
