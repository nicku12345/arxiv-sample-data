We consider the tomography problem of recovering a covector field on a simple Riemannian manifold based on its weighted Doppler transformation over a family of curves \Gamma. This is a generalization of the attenuated Doppler transform. Uniqueness is proven for a generic set of weights and families of curves under a condition on the weight function. This condition is satisfied in particular if the weight function is never zero, and its derivatives along the curves in \Gamma is never zero.
