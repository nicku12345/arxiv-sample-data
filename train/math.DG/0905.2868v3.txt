In this paper we show how techniques coming from stochastic analysis, such as stochastic completeness (in the form of the weak maximum principle at infinity), parabolicity and L^p-Liouville type results for the weighted Laplacian associated to the potential may be used to obtain triviality, rigidity results, and scalar curvature estimates for gradient Ricci solitons under L^p conditions on the relevant quantities.
