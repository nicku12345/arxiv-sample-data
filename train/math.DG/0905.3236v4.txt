Dedicated to Professor Gromoll: The aim of our article is to generalize the Toponogov comparison theorem to a complete Riemannian manifold with smooth convex boundary. A geodesic triangle will be replaced by an open (geodesic) triangle standing on the boundary of the manifold, and a model surface will be replaced by the universal covering surface of a cylinder of revolution with totally geodesic boundary. Applications of our theorem are found in our article "Applications of Toponogov's comparison theorems for open triangles" (arXiv:1102.4156).
