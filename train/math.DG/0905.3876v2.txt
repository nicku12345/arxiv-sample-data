The quantum cohomology of CP^1 provides a distinguished solution of the third Painleve equation. S. Cecotti and C. Vafa discovered this from a physical viewpoint. We derive it from a differential geometric viewpoint, using the theory of harmonic maps and in particular the generalized Weierstrass representation (DPW representation) for spacelike surfaces of constant mean curvature in Minkowski space. The nontrivial aspects are the characterization of the solution, and its global behaviour. From our point of view, the latter property says that the extended harmonic map remains entirely within a single Iwasawa orbit of the appropriate loop group.
