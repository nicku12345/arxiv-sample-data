In this paper we give a diameter bound for Sasaki manifolds with positive transverse Ricci curvature. As an application, we obtain the uniqueness of Sasaki-Einstein metrics on compact Sasaki manifolds modulo the action of the identity component of the automorphism group for the transverse holomorphic structure.
