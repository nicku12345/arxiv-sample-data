We give an explicit description and calculate the dimension of the vector space of linear natural liftings of p-forms on n-dimensional manifolds M to q-forms on T^{{\mathbb D}^r_k}M, where {\mathbb D}^r_k is the Weil algebra of r-jets at 0 of smooth functions {\mathbb R}^k\longrightarrow{\mathbb R}, for all non-negative integers n, p, q, r, k except the case p=n and q=0.
