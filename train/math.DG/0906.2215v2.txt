Negative Sasakian manifolds, where the first Chern class of the contact subbundle is a torsion class, can be viewed as Seifert-S^1 bundles where the base orbifold has an ample orbifold canonical class. We use this framework to settle completely an open problem formulated by C.Boyer and K.Galicki which asks whether or not arbitrary connected sums of S^2\times S^3 are negative Sasakian manifolds. As a consequence of the affirmative answer to this problem, there exists so-called Sasaki eta-Einstein and Lorentzian Sasaki-Einstein metrics on all of these five-manifolds and moreover all of these can be realized as links of isolated hypersurface singularities defined by weighted homogenous polynomials. The key step is to construct infinitely many hypersurfaces with branch divisors in weighted projective that contain only rational curves.
