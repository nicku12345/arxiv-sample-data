Let \Sigma be a compact Riemann surface and D_1,...,D_n a finite number of pairwise disjoint closed disks of \Sigma. We prove the existence of a proper harmonic map into the Euclidean plane from a hyperbolic domain \Omega containing \Sigma\backslash\cup_{j=1}^n D_j and of its topological type. Here, \Omega can be chosen as close as necessary to \Sigma\backslash\cup_{j=1}^n D_j. In particular, we obtain proper harmonic maps from the unit disk into the Euclidean plane, which disproves a conjecture posed by R. Schoen and S.T. Yau.
