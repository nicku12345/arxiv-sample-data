We study higher-order conservation laws of the non-linearizable elliptic Poisson equation  \frac{{\partial}^2 u}{\partial z \partial \bar{z}} = -f(u)  as elements of the characteristic cohomology of the associated exterior differential system. The theory of characteristic cohomology determines a normal form for differentiated conservation laws by realizing them as elements of the kernel of a linear differential operator. The S^1--symmetry of the PDE leads to a normal form for the undifferentiated conservation law as well. We show that for higher-order conservation laws to exist, it is necessary that f satisfies a linear second order ODE. In this case, an at most real two--dimensional space of new conservation laws in normal form appears at each even prolongation. When f_{uu}=\beta f this upper bound is attained and the work of Pinkall and Sterling allows them to be written explicitly. We relate higher-order conservation laws to generalized symmetries of the exterior differential system by identifying their generating functions. This Noether correspondence provides the connection between conservation laws and the canonical Jacobi fields of Pinkall and Sterling.
