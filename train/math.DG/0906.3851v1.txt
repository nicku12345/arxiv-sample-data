In this paper, position vectors of a time-like curve with respect to standard frame of Minkowski space E^3_1 are studied in terms of Frenet equations. First, we prove that position vector of every time-like space curve in Minkowski space E^3_1 satisfies a vector differential equation of fourth order. The general solution of mentioned vector differential equation has not yet been found. By special cases, we determine the parametric representation of the general helices from the intrinsic equations (i.e. curvature and torsion are functions of arc-length) of the time-like curve. Moreover, we give some examples to illustrate how to find the position vector from the intrinsic equations of general helices.
