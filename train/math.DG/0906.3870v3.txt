We classify closed, simply-connected non-negatively curved 5-manifolds admitting an (almost) effective, isometric T^3 or T^2 action. As a direct consequence, we show that for any manifold, of dimensions up to and including 9 under the same hypotheses, the maximal symmetry rank is equal to [2n/3] and the free rank is less than or equal to one half that value.
