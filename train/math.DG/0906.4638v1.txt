We prove that given any compact Riemannian 3-manifold with boundary M, there exists a smooth properly embedded one-manifold G, included in M, each of whose components is a simple closed curve and such that the domain D=Int(M)-G does not admit any properly immersed open surfaces with at least one annular end, bounded mean curvature, compact boundary (possibly empty) and a complete induced Riemannian metric.
