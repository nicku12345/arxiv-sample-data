Let X_0 be an affine variety with only normal isolated singularity p and \pi: X\to X_0 a smooth resolution of the singularity with trivial canonical line bundle K_X. If the complement of the affine variety X_0\backslash\{p\} is the cone C(S)=\Bbb R_{>0}\times S of an Einstein-Sasakian manifold S, we shall prove that the crepant resolution X of X_0 admits a complete Ricci-flat K\"ahler metric in every K\"ahler class in H^2(X). We apply the continuity method for solving the Monge-Amp\`ere equation to obtain a relevant existence theorem and a uniqueness theorem of Ricci-flat conical K\"ahler metrics. By using the vanishing theorem on the crepant resolution X and the Hodge and Lefschetz decompositions of the basic cohomology groups on the Sasakian manifold S, we construct an initial K\"ahler metric in every K\"ahler class on which the existence theorem can be applied.We show there are many examples of Ricci-flat complete K\"ahler manifolds arising as crepant resolutions.
