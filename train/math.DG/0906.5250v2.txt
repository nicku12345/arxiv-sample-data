Possible irreducible holonomy algebras \g\subset\osp(p,q|2m) of Riemannian supermanifolds under the assumption that \g is a direct sum of simple Lie superalgebras of classical type and possibly of a one-dimensional center are classified. This generalizes the classical result of Marcel Berger about the classification of irreducible holonomy algebras of pseudo-Riemannian manifolds.
