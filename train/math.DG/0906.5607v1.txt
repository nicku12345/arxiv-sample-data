We develop an approach to affine symplectic invariant geometry of Lagrangian surfaces by the method of moving frames. The fundamental invariants of elliptic Lagrangian immersions in affine symplectic four-space are derived together with their integrability equations. The invariant setup is applied to discuss the question of symplectic applicability for elliptic Lagrangian immersions. Explicit examples are considered.
