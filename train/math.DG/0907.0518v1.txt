Using the lamination theory developed by Colding and Minicozzi for sequences of embedded, finite genus minimal surfaces with boundaries going to infinity \cite{CM5}, we show that the space of genus-one helicoids is compact (modulo rigid motions and homotheties). This generalizes a result of Hoffman and White \cite{HW}.
