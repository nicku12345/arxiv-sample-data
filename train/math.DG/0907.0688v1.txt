Using an integrable discrete Dirac operator, we construct a discrete version of the Weierstrass representation of time-like surfaces parametrized along isotropic directions in R^{2,1}, R^{3,1} and R^{2,2}. The corresponding discrete surfaces have isotropic edges. We show that any discrete surface satisfying a general monotonicity condition and having isotropic edges admits such a representation.
