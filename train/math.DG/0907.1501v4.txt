The canonical connection on a Riemannian almost product manifold is an analogue to the Hermitian connection on an almost Hermitian manifold. In this paper we consider the canonical connection on a class of Riemannian almost product manifolds with non-integrable almost product structure. We construct and characterize an example by a Lie group.
