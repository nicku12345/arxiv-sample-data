In the present work, we introduce a linear connection (preserving the almost product structure and the Riemannian metric) on Riemannian almost product manifolds. This connection, called P-connection, is an analogue of the first canonical connection of Lichnerowicz in the Hermitian geometry and the B-connection in the geometry of the almost complex manifolds with Norden metric. Particularly, we consider the P-connection on a the class of manifolds with nonintegrable almost product structure.
