In this article we extend the Gallot-Tanno theorem to closed pseudo-Riemannian manifolds. It is done by showing that if the cone over such a manifold admits a parallel symmetric 2-tensor then it is incomplete and has non zero constant curvature. An application of this result to the existence of metrics with distinct Levi-Civita connections but having the same unparametrized geodesics is given.
