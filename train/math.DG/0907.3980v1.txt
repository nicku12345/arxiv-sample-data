In this paper we consider the equiform motion of a helix in Euclidean space \mathbf{E}^7. We study and analyze the corresponding kinematic three dimensional surface under the hypothesis that its scalar curvature \mathbf{K} is constant. Under this assumption, we prove that if the scalar curvature \mathbf{K} is constant, then \mathbf{K} must equal zero.
