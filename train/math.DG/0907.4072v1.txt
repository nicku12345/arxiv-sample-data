We study locally homogeneous rigid geometric structures on surfaces. We show that a locally homogeneous projective connection on a compact surface is flat. We also show that a locally homogeneous unimodular affine connection on a two dimensional torus is complete and, up to a finite cover, homogeneous.   Let \nabla be a unimodular real analytic affine connection on a real analytic compact connected surface M. If \nabla is locally homogeneous on a nontrivial open set in M, we prove that \nabla is locally homogeneous on all of M.
