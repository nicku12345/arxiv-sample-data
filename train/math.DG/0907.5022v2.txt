The paper is constructed in two parts.In the first part we introduce the concept of the algebra of Q-meromorphic functions on the quantum plane.The A (q)-algebra of Q-analytic functions considered in[6]is seen as a proper subalgebra. In the second part we find a formula for the curvature tensor on this algebra. It is seen that when the quantization parameter tendsto 1,then this formula gives the flatness of the usual R^2 .
