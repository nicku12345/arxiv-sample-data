We give sharp sectional curvature estimates for complete immersed cylindrically bounded m-submanifolds \phi:M\to N\times\mathbb{R}^{\ell}, n+\ell\leq 2m-1 provided that either \phi is proper with the second fundamental form with certain controlled growth or M has scalar curvature with strong quadratic decay. This latter gives a non-trivial extension of the Jorge-Koutrofiotis Theorem [7]
