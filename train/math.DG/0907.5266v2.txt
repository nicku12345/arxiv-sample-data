Let (M,g) be a Riemannian manifold and G a nondegenerate g-natural metric on its tangent bundle T M . In this paper we establish a relation between the Jacobi operators of (M,g) and that of (T M,G). In the case of a Riemannian surface (M,g), we compute explicitly the spectrum of some Jacobi operators of (TM,G) and give necessary and sufficient conditions for (T M,G) to be an Osserman manifold.
