In this article we generalize the notion of constant angle surfaces in S^2 x R and H^2 x R to general Bianchi-Cartan-Vranceanu spaces, i.e. essentially to three-dimensional homogeneous spaces with a four-dimensional isometry group. We show that these surfaces have constant Gaussian curvature and we give a complete local classification in the Heisenberg group.
