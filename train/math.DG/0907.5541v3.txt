Following ideas of Choe and Fernandez-do Carmo, we give sufficient conditions for a disk type surface, with piecewise smooth boundary, to be totally umbilical for a given Coddazi pair. As a consequence, we obtain rigidity results for surfaces in space forms and in homogeneous product spaces that generalizes some known results.
