In this paper, we have tried to apply the concepts of fuzzy sets to Lie groups and its relative concepts. First, we define a {\cal C}^1 fuzzy submanifold after reviewing {\cal C}^1-fuzzy manifold definition. In main section, we defined the Lie group and some its relative concepts such as fuzzy transformation group, fuzzy G-invariant. Our aim is to prepare the suitable conditions for defining fuzzy differential invariant by constructing suitable objects.
