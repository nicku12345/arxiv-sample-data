Given a maximally non-integrable 2-distribution {\mathcal D} on a 5-manifold M, it was discovered by P. Nurowski that one can naturally associate a conformal structure [g]_{\mathcal D} of signature (2,3) on M. We show that those conformal structures [g]_{\mathcal D} which come about by this construction are characterized by the existence of a normal conformal Killing 2-form which is locally decomposable and satisfies a genericity condition. We further show that every conformal Killing field of [g]_{\mathcal D} can be decomposed into a symmetry of {\mathcal D} and an almost Einstein scale of [g]_{\mathcal D}.
