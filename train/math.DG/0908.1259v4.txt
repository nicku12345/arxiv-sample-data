Let G_1 and G_2 be Lie groups furnished with bi-invariant metrics and f:G_1\rightarrow G_2 be a Lie group homomorphism which is also a minimal isometric immersion. If G_1 is compact and connected, we prove that either G_1 is isometric to a flat torus or f is unstable as a harmonic map. We also apply this result to the case in which f is the inclusion of a compact, connected Lie subgroup of a Lie group, as well as to construct several examples of unstable harmonic maps into the orthogonal group.
