In recent work N. Hitchin introduced the concept of "generalised geometry". The key feature of generalised structures is that that they can be acted on by both diffeomorphisms and 2-forms, the so-called B-fields. In this lecture, we give a basic introduction and explain some of the fundamental ideas. Further, we discuss some examples of generalised geometries starting from the usual notion of a Calabi-Yau manifold, as well as applications to string theory.
