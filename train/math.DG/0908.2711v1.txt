The aim of this paper is to prove isoperimetric inequalities on submanifolds of the Euclidean space using mass transportation methods. We obtain a sharp ?weighted isoperimetric inequality? and a nonsharp classical inequality similar to the one obtained by J. Michael and L. Simon. The proof relies on the description of a solution of the problem of Monge when the initial measure is supported in a submanifold and the final one supported in a linear subspace of the same dimension.
