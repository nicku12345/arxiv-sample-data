The aim of this paper is to study the local components of the relativistic time dependent d-linear connections, d-torsions, d-curvatures and deflection d-tensors with respect to an adapted basis on the 1-jet space J^{1}(R,M). The Ricci identities, together with their corresponding identities of deflection d-tensors, are also given.
