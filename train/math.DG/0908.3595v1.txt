We study hypersurfaces either in the sphere \s{n+1} or in the hyperbolic space \h{n+1} whose position vector x satisfies the condition L_kx=Ax+b, where L_k is the linearized operator of the (k+1)-th mean curvature of the hypersurface for a fixed k=0,...,n-1, A\in\R{(n+2)\times (n+2)} is a constant matrix and b\in\R{n+2} is a constant vector. For every k, we prove that when A is self-adjoint and b=0, the only hypersurfaces satisfying that condition are hypersurfaces with zero (k+1)-th mean curvature and constant k-th mean curvature, and open pieces of standard Riemannian products of the form \s{m}(\sqrt{1-r^2})\times\s{n-m}(r)\subset\s{n+1}, with 0<r<1, and \h{m}(-\sqrt{1+r^2})\times\s{n-m}(r)\subset\h{n+1}, with r>0. If H_k is constant, we also obtain a classification result for the case where b\neq 0.
