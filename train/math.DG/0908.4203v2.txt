We show the existence of isometric (or Ford) fundamental regions for a large class of subgroups of the isometry group of any rank one Riemannian symmetric space of noncompact type. The proof does not use the classification of symmetric spaces. All hitherto known existence results of isometric fundamental regions and domains are essentially subsumed by our work.
