These are notes of a talk I gave in a seminar at the University of Pennsylvania summarizing results in the Ph.D. thesis of Michael Mueter obtained under the direction of Wolfgang Meyer at the University of Muenster. His thesis on "Kruemmungserhoehende Deformationen mittels Gruppenaktionen" examines in detail curvature properties of so called Cheeger deformations. Such deformations have been a crucial ingredient in non-negative and positive curvature constructions. His thesis contains a wealth of interesting properties of such deformations, but since it was never published, is only known to a few experts. I have no intention to publish these notes, but post them as a service to the public. A scanned version of his thesis (written in German) is available on my homepage.
