These are notes of a talk I gave in a seminar at the University of Pennsylvania summarizing results in the Habilitation by Jost Eschenburg on "Freie isometrische Aktionen auf kompakten Lie-Gruppen mit positiv gekruemmten Orbitraeumen". Due to the fact that it is published in a not easily accesible journal (and is written in German) some of the results of his Habilitation are not as well known as they deserve. Although the main results on new examples with positive curvature were later published elsewhere, it contains a wealth of further information about biquotients and a classification of equal rank biquotients of simple Lie groups. I have no intention to publish these notes, but post them as a service to the public. A scanned version of his Habilitation (written in German) is available on my homepage.
