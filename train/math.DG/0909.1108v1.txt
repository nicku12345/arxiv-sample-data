In this paper, we define a new family of curves and call it a {\it family of similar curves with variable transformation} or briefly {\it SA-curves}. Also we introduce some characterizations of this family and we give some theorems. This definition introduces a new classification of a space curve. Also, we use this definition to deduce the position vectors of plane curves, general helices and slant helices, as examples of a similar curves with variable transformation.
