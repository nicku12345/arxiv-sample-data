Let (M,\mathcal{F}) be a closed manifold with a Riemannian foliation. The \'{A}lvarez class is the cohomology class of degree 1 of M whose triviality characterizes the minimizability of (M,\mathcal{F}). We show that the integral of the \'{A}lvarez class along every closed path in M is the logarism of an algebraic integer if \pi_{1}M is polycyclic or \mathcal{F} is of polynomial growth.
