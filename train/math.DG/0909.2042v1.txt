We obtain some nonexistence results for complete noncompact stable hyppersurfaces with nonnegative constant scalar curvature in Euclidean spaces. As a special case we prove that there is no complete noncompact strongly stable hypersurface M in \mathbb{R}^{4} with zero scalar curvature S_2, nonzero Gauss-Kronecker curvature and finite total curvature (i.e. \int_M|A|^3<+\infty).
