In homogenous space Sol we study compact surfaces with constant mean curvature and with non-empty boundary. We ask how the geometry of the boundary curve imposes restrictions over all possible configurations that the surface can adopt. We obtain a flux formula and we establish results that assert that, under some restrictions, the symmetry of the boundary is inherited into the surface.
