A surface in homogenous space Sol is said to be an invariant surface if it is invariant under some of the two 1-parameter groups of isometries of the ambient space whose fix point sets are totally geodesic surfaces. In this work we study invariant surfaces that satisfy a certain condition on their curvatures. We classify invariant surfaces with constant mean curvature and constant Gaussian curvature. Also, we characterize invariant surfaces that satisfy a linear Weingarten relation.
