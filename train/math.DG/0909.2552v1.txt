In this work, we study spacelike surfaces in Minkowski space E_1^3 foliated by pieces of circles and that satisfy a linear Weingarten condition of type a H+b K=c, where a,b and c are constant and H and K denote the mean curvature and the Gauss curvature respectively. We show that such surfaces must be surfaces of revolution or surfaces with constant mean curvature H=0 or surfaces with constant Gauss curvature K=0.
