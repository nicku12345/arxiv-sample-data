In this paper, we prove that on every Finsler n-sphere (S^n, F) with reversibility \lambda satisfying F^2<(\frac{\lambda+1}{\lambda})^2g_0 and l(S^n, F)\ge \pi(1+\frac{1}{\lambda}), there always exist at least n prime closed geodesics without self-intersections, where g_0 is the standard Riemannian metric on S^n with constant curvature 1 and l(S^n, F) is the length of a shortest geodesic loop on (S^n, F). We also study the stability of these closed geodesics.
