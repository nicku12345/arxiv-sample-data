While small deformations of K\"ahler manifolds are K\"ahler too, we prove that the cohomological property to be \mathcal{C}^\infty-pure-and-full is not a stable condition under small deformations. This property, that has been recently introduced and studied by T.-J. Li and W. Zhang in [Comparing tamed and compatible symplectic cones and cohomological properties of almost complex manifolds, Comm. Anal. Geom.] and T. Dr\v{a}ghici, T.-J. Li, and W. Zhang in [Symplectic forms and cohomology decomposition of almost complex four-manifolds, Int. Math. Res. Not.], [On the J-anti-invariant cohomology of almost complex 4-manifolds, to appear in Q. J. Math.], is weaker than the K\"ahler one and characterizes the almost-complex structures that induce a decomposition in cohomology. We also study the stability of this property along curves of almost-complex structures constructed starting from the harmonic representatives in special cohomology classes.
