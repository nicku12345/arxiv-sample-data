We study locally compact contractive local groups, that is, locally compact local groups with a contractive pseudo-automorphism. We prove that if such an object is locally connected, then it is locally isomorphic to a Lie group. We also prove a related structure theorem for locally compact contractive local groups which are not necessarily locally connected. These results are local analogues of theorems for locally compact contractive groups.
