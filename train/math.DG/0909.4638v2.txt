In this paper, we study the invariant and noninvariant hypersurfaces of (1,1,1) almost contact manifolds, Lorentzian almost paracontact manifolds and Lorentzian para-Sasakian manifolds, respectively. We show that a noninvariant hypersurface of an (1,1,1) almost contact manifold admits an almost product structure. We investigate hypersurfaces of affinely cosymplectic and normal (1,1,1) almost contact manifolds. It is proved that a noninvariant hypersurface of a Lorentzian almost paracontact manifold is an almost product metric manifold. Some necessary and sufficient conditions have been given for a noninvariant hypersurface of a Lorentzian para-Sasakian manifold to be locally product manifold. We establish a Lorentzian para-Sasakian structure for an invariant hypersurface of a Lorentzian para-Sasakian manifold. Finally we give some examples for invariant and noninvariant hypersurfaces of a Lorentzian para-Sasakian manifold.
