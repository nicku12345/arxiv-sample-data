Let M=X\times Y be the product of two complex manifolds of positive dimensions.   In this paper, we prove that there is no complete K\"ahler metric g on M such that: either (i) the holomorphic bisectional curvature of g is bounded by a negative constant and the Ricci curvature is bounded below by -C(1+r^2) where r is the distance from a fixed point; or (ii) g has nonpositive sectional curvature and the holomorphic bisectional curvature is bounded above by -B(1+r^2)^{-\delta} and the Ricci curvature is bounded below by -A(1+r^2)^\gamma where A, B, \gamma, \delta are positive constants with \gamma+2\delta<1. These are generalizations of some previous results, in particular the result of Seshadri and Zheng.
