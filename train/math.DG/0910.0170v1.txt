In this paper we construct a new family of harmonic morphisms \varphi:V^5\to\s^2, where V^5 is a 5-dimensional open manifold contained in an ellipsoidal hypersurface of \c^4=\r^8. These harmonic morphisms admit a continuous extension to the completion {V^{\ast}}^5, which turns out to be an explicit real algebraic variety. We work in the context of a generalization of the Hopf construction and equivariant theory.
