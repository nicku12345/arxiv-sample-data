The notions of \emph{Poisson Lie group} and \emph{Poisson homogeneous space} are extended to the Dirac category. The theorem of Drinfel'd (\cite{Drinfeld93}) on the one-to-one correspondence between Poisson homogeneous spaces of a Poisson Lie group and a special class of Lagrangian subalgebras of the Lie bialgebra associated to the Poisson Lie group is proved to hold in this more general setting.
