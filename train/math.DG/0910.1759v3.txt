In this paper, we introduce a new notion named as Schr\"odinger soliton. So-called Schr\"odinger solitons are defined as a class of special solutions to the Schr\"odinger flow equation from a Riemannian manifold or a Lorentzian manifold M into a K\"ahler manifold N. If the target manifold N admits a Killing potential, then the Schr\"odinger soliton is just a harmonic map with potential from M into N. Especially, if the domain manifold is a Lorentzian manifold, the Schr\"odinger soliton is a wave map with potential into N. Then we apply the geometric energy method to this wave map system, and obtain the local well-posedness of the corresponding Cauchy problem as well as global existence in 1+1 dimension. As an application, we obtain the existence of Schr\"odinger soliton of the hyperbolic Ishimori system.
