We describe infinitesimal deformations of constant mean curvature surfaces of finite type in the 3-sphere. We use Baker-Akhiezer functions to describe such deformations, as well as polynomial Killing fields and the corresponding spectral curve to distinguish between isospectral and non-isospectral deformations.
