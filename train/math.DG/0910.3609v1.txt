An affine hypersurface M is said to admit a pointwise symmetry, if there exists a subgroup G of {\rm Aut}(T_p M) for all p\in M, which preserves (pointwise) the affine metric h, the difference tensor K and the affine shape operator S. Here, we consider 3-dimensional indefinite affine hyperspheres, i.e. S= HId (and thus S is trivially preserved). In Part 1 we found the possible symmetry groups G and gave for each G a canonical form of K. We started a classification by showing that hyperspheres admitting a pointwise {\mathbb Z}_2\times {\mathbb Z}_2 resp. {\mathbb R}-symmetry are well-known, they have constant sectional curvature and Pick invariant J<0 resp. J=0. Here, we continue with affine hyperspheres admitting a pointwise {\mathbb Z}_3- or SO(2)-symmetry. They turn out to be warped products of affine spheres ({\mathbb Z}_3) or quadrics (SO(2)) with a curve.
