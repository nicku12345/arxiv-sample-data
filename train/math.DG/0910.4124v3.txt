For all open Riemann surface M and real number \theta \in (0,\pi/4), we construct a conformal minimal immersion X=(X_1,X_2,X_3):M \to \mathbb{R}^3 such that X_3+\tan(\theta) |X_1|:M \to \mathbb{R} is positive and proper. Furthermore, X can be chosen with arbitrarily prescribed flux map.   Moreover, we produce properly immersed hyperbolic minimal surfaces with non empty boundary in \mathbb{R}^3 lying above a negative sublinear graph.
