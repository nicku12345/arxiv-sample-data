We prove that for any open Riemann surface M and any non constant harmonic function h:M \to \mathbb{R}, there exists a complete conformal minimal immersion X:M \to \mathbb{R}^3 whose third coordinate function coincides with h.   As a consequence, complete minimal surfaces with arbitrary conformal structure and whose Gauss map misses two points are constructed.
