In this paper we construct infinitely many examples of a Riemannian submersion from a simple, compact Lie group G with bi-invariant metric onto a smooth manifold that cannot be a quotient of G by a group action. This partially addresses a question of K. Grove's about Riemannian submersions from Lie groups.
