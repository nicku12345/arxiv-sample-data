We prove that if u is a bounded smooth function in the kernel of a nonnegative Schrodinger operator -L=-(\Delta +q) on a parabolic Riemannian manifold M, then u is either identically zero or it has no zeros on M, and the linear space of such functions is 1-dimensional. We obtain consequences for orientable, complete stable surfaces with constant mean curvature H\in\mathbb{R} in homogeneous spaces \mathbb{E}(\kappa,\tau) with four dimensional isometry group. For instance, if M is an orientable, parabolic, complete immersed surface with constant mean curvature H in \mathbb{H}^2\times\mathbb{R}, then |H|\leq 1/2 and if equality holds, then M is either an entire graph or a vertical horocylinder.
