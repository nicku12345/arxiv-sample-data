We deal here with the geometry of the twistor fibration \mathcal{Z} \to \bb{S}^3_1 over the De Sitter 3-space. The total space \mathcal{Z} is a five dimensional reductive homogeneous space with two canonical invariant almost CR structures. Fixed the normal metric on \mathcal{Z} we study the harmonic map equation for smooth maps of Riemann surfaces into \mathcal{Z}. A characterization of spacelike surfaces with harmonic twistor lifts to \mathcal{Z} is obtained. It is also shown that the harmonic map equation for twistor lifts can be formulated as the curvature vanishing of an \bb{S}^1-loop of connections i.e. harmonic twistor lifts exist within \bb{S}^1-families. Special harmonic maps such as holomorphic twistor lifts are also considered and some remarks concerning (compact) vacua of the twistor energy are given.
