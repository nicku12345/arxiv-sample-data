In this note, we prove the following generalization of a theorem of Shi and Tam \cite{ShiTam02}: Let (\Omega, g) be an n-dimensional (n \geq 3) compact Riemannian manifold, spin when n>7, with non-negative scalar curvature and mean convex boundary. If every boundary component \Sigma_i has positive scalar curvature and embeds isometrically as a mean convex star-shaped hypersurface {\hat \Sigma}_i \subset \R^n, then   \int_{\Sigma_i} H d \sigma \le \int_{{\hat \Sigma}_i} \hat{H} d {\hat \sigma} where H is the mean curvature of \Sigma_i in (\Omega, g), \hat{H} is the Euclidean mean curvature of {\hat \Sigma}_i in \R^n, and where d \sigma and d {\hat \sigma} denote the respective volume forms. Moreover, equality in (\ref{eqn: main theorem}) holds for some boundary component \Sigma_i if, and only if, (\Omega, g) is isometric to a domain in \R^n.   In the proof, we make use of a foliation of the exterior of the \hat \Sigma_i's in \R^n by the \frac{H}{R}-flow studied by Gerhardt \cite{Gerhardt90} and Urbas \cite{Urbas90}. We also carefully establish the rigidity statement in low dimensions without the spin assumption that was used in \cite{ShiTam02}
