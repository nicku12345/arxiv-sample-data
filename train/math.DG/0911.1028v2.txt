In this paper, the relationship between the existence of special lagrangian submanifolds and the collapsing of Calabi-Yau manifolds is studied. First, special lagrangian fibrations are constructed on some regions of bounded curvature and sufficiently collapsed in Ricci-flat Calabi-Yau manifolds. Then, in the opposite direction,it is shown that the existence of special lagrangian submanifolds with small volume implies the collapsing of some regions in the ambient Calabi-Yau manifolds.
