In this paper, we study submanifolds with constant rth mean curvature S_r. We investigate, the stability of such submanifolds in the case when they are leaves of a codimension one foliation. We also generalize recent results by Barros - Sousa and Al\'{i}as - Colares, concerning conformal fields, to an arbitrary manifold. Using this we show that normal component of a Killing field is a rth Jacobi field of a submanifold with S_{r+1} constant. Finally, we study relations between rth Jacobi fields and vector fields preserving a foliation.
