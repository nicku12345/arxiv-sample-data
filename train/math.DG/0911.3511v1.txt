In this paper, we discuss the invariant properties of curvatures effected by the Matsumoto's C or L-process. We find equivalent conditions on curvatures by comparing the difference between the corresponding curvatures of closely related connections. As an application, Matsumoto's L-process on Randers manifold is studied. Shen connection can not be obtained by using Matsumoto's processes from other well-known connections. This leads us to two new processes which we call Shen's C and L-processes. We study the invariant properties of curvatures under the Shen's processes.
