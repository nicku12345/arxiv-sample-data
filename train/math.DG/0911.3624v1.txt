We classify real hypersurfaces in complex space forms with constant principal curvatures and whose Hopf vector field has two nontrivial projections onto the principal curvature spaces. In complex projective spaces such real hypersurfaces do not exist. In complex hyperbolic spaces these are holomorphically congruent to open parts of tubes around the ruled minimal submanifolds with totally real normal bundle introduced by Berndt and Bruck. In particular, they are open parts of homogenous ones.
