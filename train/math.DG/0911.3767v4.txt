We consider differential operators L acting on functions on a Riemannian surface, \Sigma, of the form L = \Delta + V -a K ,where \Delta is the Laplacian of \Sigma, K is the Gaussian curvature, a is a positive constant and V \in C^{\infty}(\Sigma). Such operators L arise as the stability operator of \Sigma immersed in a Riemannian three-manifold with constant mean curvature (for particular choices of V and a).   We assume L is nonpositive acting on functions compactly supported on \Sigma. If the potential, V:= c + P  with c a nonnegative constant, verifies either an integrability condition, i.e. P \in L^1(\Sigma) and P is non positive, or a decay condition with respect to a point p_0 \in \Sigma, i.e. |P(q)|\leq M/d(p_0,q) (where d is the distance function in \Sigma), we control the topology and conformal type of \Sigma. Moreover, we establish a {\it Distance Lemma}.   We apply such results to complete oriented stable H-surfaces immersed in a Killing submersion.
