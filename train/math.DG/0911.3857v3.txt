Let M and N be Riemannian symmetric spaces and f:M\to N be a parallel isometric immersion. We additionally assume that there exist simply connected, irreducible Riemannian symmetric spaces M_i with \dim(M_i)\geq 2 for i=1,...,r such that M\cong M_1\times...\times M_r . As a starting point, we describe how the intrinsic product structure of M is reflected by a distinguished, fiberwise orthogonal direct sum decomposition of the corresponding first normal bundle. Then we consider the (second) osculating bundle \osc f, which is a \nabla^N-parallel vector subbundle of the pullback bundle f^*TN, and establish the existence of r distinguished, pairwise commuting, \nabla^N-parallel vector bundle involutions on \osc f . Consequently, the "extrinsic holonomy Lie algebra" of \osc f bears naturally the structure of a graded Lie algebra over the Abelian group which is given by the direct sum of r copies of \Z/2 \Z . Our main result is the following: Provided that N is of compact or non-compact type, that \dim(M_i)\geq 3 for i=1,...,r and that none of the product slices through one point of M gets mapped into any flat of N, we can show that f(M) is a homogeneous submanifold of N .
