This paper deals with naturally reductive pseudo-Riemannian 2-step nilpotent Lie groups (N, \la \,,\,\ra_N), such that \la \,,\,\ra_N is invariant under a left action. The case of nondegenerate center is completely characterized. In fact, whenever \la \,,\, \ra_N restricts to a metric in the center it is proved here that the simply connected Lie group N can be constructed starting from a real representation (\pi,\vv) of a certain Lie algebra \ggo. We study the geometry of (N, \la \,,\,\ra_N) and we find the corresponding naturally reductive homogeneous structure. On the other hand, related to the case of degenerate center we provide another family of naturally reductive spaces, both non compact and also compact examples.
