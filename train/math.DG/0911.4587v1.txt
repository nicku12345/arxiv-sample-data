Positive Quaternion Kaehler Manifolds are Riemannian manifolds with holonomy contained in Sp(n)Sp(1) and with positive scalar curvature. Conjecturally, they are symmetric spaces. We prove this conjecture in dimension 20 under additional assumptions and we provide recognition theorems for quaternionic projective spaces (in low dimensions) as well as the real Grassmanian (which is Positive Quaternion Kaehler).
