In this note, we prove two Kazdan-Warner type identities involving v^{(2k)}, the renormalized volume coefficients of a Riemannian manifold (M^n,g), and G_{2r}, the so-called Gauss-Bonnet curvature, and a conformal Killing vector field on (M^n,g). In the case when the Riemannian manifold is locally conformally flat, v^{(2k)}=(-2)^{-k}\sigma_k, G_{2r}(g)=\frac{4^r(n-r)!r!}{(n-2r)!}\sigma_r, and our results reduce to earlier ones established by Viaclovsky and by the second author.
