In this paper we study the 3-dimensional (\varepsilon) -para Sasakian manifolds. We obtain an necessary and sufficient condition for an (\varepsilon ) -para Sasakian 3 -manifold to be an indefinite space form. We show that a Ricci-semi-symmetric (\varepsilon) -para Sasakian 3 -manifold is an indefinite space form. We investigate the necessary and sufficient condition for an (\varepsilon) -para Sasakian 3 -manifold to be locally \varphi -symmetric. It is proved that in an  (\varepsilon) -para Sasakian 3-manifold with \eta  -parallel Ricci tensor the scalar curvature is constant. It is also shown that every (\varepsilon) -para Sasakian 3-manifolds is pseudosymmetric in the sense of R. Deszcz.
