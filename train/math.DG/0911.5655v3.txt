The study of quasi-K\"ahler Chern-flat almost Hermitian manifolds is strictly related to the study of anti-bi-invariant almost complex Lie algebras. In the present paper we show that quasi-K\"ahler Chern-flat almost Hermitian structures on compact manifolds are in correspondence to complex parallelisable Hermitian structures satisfying the second Gray identity. From an algebraic point of view this correspondence reads as a natural correspondence between anti-bi-invariant almost complex structures on Lie algebras to bi-invariant complex structures. Some natural algebraic problems are approached and some exotic examples are carefully described.
