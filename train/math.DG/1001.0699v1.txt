The Lamarle Formula, given by Kruppa in \cite{Kr}, is known as a relationship between the Gaussian curvature and the distribution parameter of a ruled surface in the surface theory. The ruled surfaces were investigated in 3 different classes with respect to the character of base curves and rulings, \cite{Tu1},\cite{Tu2}. In this paper on account of these studies, the relationships between the Gaussian curvatures and distribution parameters of spacelike ruled surface, timelike ruled surface with spacelike ruling and timelike ruled surface with timelike ruling are obtained, respectively. These relationships are called as Lorentzian Lamarle formulas. Finally some examples concerning with these relations are given.
