Together with spaces of constant sectional curvature and products of a real line with a manifold of constant curvature, the socalled Egorov spaces and \varepsilon-spaces exhaust the class of n-dimensional Lorentzian manifolds admitting a group of isometries of dimension at least {1/2} n(n-1)+1, for almost all values of n [Patrangenaru V., Geom. Dedicata 102 (2003), 25-33]. We shall prove that the curvature tensor of these spaces satisfy several interesting algebraic properties. In particular, we will show that Egorov spaces are Ivanov-Petrova manifolds, curvature-Ricci commuting (indeed, semi-symmetric) and \mathcal P-spaces, and that \varepsilon-spaces are Ivanov-Petrova and curvature-curvature commuting manifolds.
