We prove a generalization of Thom's transversality theorem. It gives conditions under which the jet map f_*|_Y:Y\subseteq J^r(D,M)\ra J^r(D,N) is generically (for f:M\ra N) transverse to a submanifold Z\subseteq J^r(D,N). We apply this to study transversality properties of a restriction of a fixed map g:M\ra P to the preimage (j^sf)^{-1}(A) of a submanifold A\subseteq J^s(M,N) in terms of transversality properties of the original map f. Our main result is that for a reasonable class of submanifolds A and a generic map f the restriction g|_{(j^sf)^{-1}(A)} is also generic. We also present an example of A where the theorem fails.
