We study area-stationary, or maximal, surfaces in the space {\mathbb L}({\mathbb H}^3) of oriented geodesics of hyperbolic 3-space, endowed with the canonical neutral K\"ahler structure. We prove that every holomorphic curve in {\mathbb L}({\mathbb H}^3) is a maximal surface. We then classify Lagrangian maximal surfaces \Sigma in {\mathbb L}({\mathbb H}^3) and prove that the family of parallel surfaces in {\mathbb H}^3 orthogonal to the geodesics \gamma\in\Sigma form a family of equidistant tubes around a geodesic.
