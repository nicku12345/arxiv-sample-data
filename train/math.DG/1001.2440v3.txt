In this paper, first and second type admissible Mannheim partner curves are defined in pseudo-Galilean space G_3^1. Moreover, it is proved that the distance between the reciprocal points of both of first and second type admissible Mannheim curves and the torsions of these curves are constant. Furthermore, the relations for curvatures and torsions of these curves and Schell Theorem are obtained. Finally, a result about these curves being general helix is given.
