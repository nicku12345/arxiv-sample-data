On the slit tangent manifold of a Finsler manifold M are given the vertical and the Liouville foliations. In this paper we define some new types of vertical forms with respect to the Liouville foliation on TM^0. We define a cohomology group of TM^0 using these new forms. We prove a de Rham type theorem.
