There exist non-degenerate 3-form d\omega_I, \omega_I(X,Y)=g(IX,Y), for each leftinvariant almost Hermitian structure (g,I), where g is Killing-Cartan metric on the M=S^3\times S^3=SU(2)\times SU(2). Known \cite{H1}, that arbitrary non-degenerate 3-form on the 6-dimensional manifold, with some additional properties defines the almost complex structure. Condition for I to define almost complex structure J_I by d\omega_I is obtained. Properties of J_I are researched.
