Given an m-dimensional closed connected Riemannian manifold M smoothly isometrically immersed in an n-dimensional Riemannian manifold N, we estimate the diameter of M in terms of its mean curvature field integral under some geometric restrictions, and therefore generalize a recent work of Topping in the Euclidean case (Comment. Math. Helv., 83 (2008), 539--546).
