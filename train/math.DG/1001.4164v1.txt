After G. Perelman's solution of the Poincare Conjecture, this is a different way toward it. Given a simply connected, closed 3-manifold M, we produce a homotopy disc H, which arises from M by a finite sequence of simple modifications and, almost miraculously, can be imbedded into the ordinary space R^3. It follows that H is a disc, hence M is a sphere. In order to construct H, we use a special stratification of M, based on the fact that M is simply connected.
