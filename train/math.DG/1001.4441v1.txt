The holonomy algebra \g of an n+2-dimensional Lorentzian manifold (M,g) admitting a parallel distribution of isotropic lines is contained in the subalgebra \simil(n)=(\Real\oplus\so(n))\zr\Real^n\subset\so(1,n+1). An important invariant of \g is its \so(n)-projection \h\subset\so(n), which is a Riemannian holonomy algebra. One component of the curvature tensor of the manifold belongs to the space \P(\h) consisting of linear maps from \Real^n to \h satisfying an identity similar to the Bianchi one. In the present paper the spaces \P(\h) are computed for each possible \h. This gives the complete description of the values of the curvature tensor of the manifold (M,g). These results can be applied e.g. to the holonomy classification of the Einstein Lorentzian manifolds.
