We classify pseudo-Riemannian submersions with connected totally geodesic fibres from a real pseudo-hyperbolic space onto a pseudo-Riemannian manifold. Also, we obtain the classification of the pseudo-Riemannian submersions with (para-)complex connected totally geodesic fibres from a (para-)complex pseudo-hyperbolic space onto a pseudo-Riemannian manifold.
