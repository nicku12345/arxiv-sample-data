Let G be a non-compact simple Lie group with Lie algebra \mathfrak{g}. Denote with m(\mathfrak{g}) the dimension of the smallest non-trivial \mathfrak{g}-module with an invariant non-degenerate symmetric bilinear form. For an irreducible finite volume pseudo-Riemannian analytic manifold M it is observed that \dim(M) \geq \dim(G) + m(\mathfrak{g}) when M admits an isometric G-action with a dense orbit. The Main Theorem considers the case G = \widetilde{\mathrm{SO}}_0(p,q) providing an explicit description of M when the bound is achieved. In such case, M is (up to a finite covering) the quotient by a lattice of either \widetilde{\mathrm{SO}}_0(p+1,q) or \widetilde{\mathrm{SO}}_0(p,q+1).
