We give a necessary and sufficient condition on the 1-jet of a field of nilpotent endomorphisms to be integrable. Together with the well known corresponding condition for an almost complex structure, the nullity of its Nijenhuis tensor, this gives an integrability condition for any field of endomorphisms.
