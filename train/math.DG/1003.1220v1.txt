In this paper, it is proved that, no special timelike Frenet curve is a Bertrand curve in \mathbb{E}_2^4 and also, in \mathbb{E}_\nu^{n+1}  ({n \ge 3}), such that the notion of Bertrand curve is definite only in \mathbb{E}_1^2 and \mathbb{E}_1^3. Therefore, a generalization of timelike Bertrand curve is defined and called as timelike (1,3)-Bertrand curve in \mathbb{E}_2^4. Moreover, the characterization of timelike (1,3)-Bertrand curve is given in \mathbb{E}_2^4.
