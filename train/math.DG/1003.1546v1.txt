Let M be a quasi-Fuchsian three-manifold that contains a closed incompressible surface with principal curvatures within the range of the unit interval, for a prescribed function H (with mild conditions) on M, we construct a closed incompressible surface with mean curvature H . A direct application is the existence of embedded surfaces of prescribed constant mean curvatures with constants in (-2,2).
