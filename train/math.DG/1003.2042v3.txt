In this paper we consider the idea of Mannheim partner curves for curves lying on surfaces and by considering the Darboux frames of them we define these curves as Mannheim partner D-curves and give the characterizations for these curves. We also find the relations between the geodesic curvatures, the normal curvatures and the geodesic torsions of these associated curves. Furthermore, we show that the definition and the characterizations of Mannheim partner D-curves include those of Mannheim partner curves in some special cases.
