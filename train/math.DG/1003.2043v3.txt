In this paper, we give the definition, different types and characterizations of Mannheim partner D-curves in Minkowski 3-space. We find the relations between the geodesic curvatures, the normal curvatures and the geodesic torsions of these associated curves. Furthermore, we show that the definition and the characterizations of Mannheim partner D-curves include those of Mannheim partner curves in some special cases in Minkowski 3-space.
