In this paper we consider the idea of Bertrand curves for curves lying on surfaces and by considering the Darboux frames of them we define these curves as Bertrand D-curves and give the characterizations for these curves. We also find the relations between the geodesic curvatures, the normal curvatures and the geodesic torsions of these associated curves. Furthermore, we show that the definition and the characterizations of Bertrand D-curves include those of Bertrand curves in some special cases.
