The holonomy group G of a pseudo-quaternionic-K\"ahlerian manifold of signature (4r,4s) with non-zero scalar curvature is contained in \Sp(1)\cdot\Sp(r,s) and it contains \Sp(1). It is proved that either G is irreducible, or s=r and G preserves an isotropic subspace of dimension 4r, in the last case, there are only two possibilities for the connected component of the identity of such G. This gives the classification of possible connected holonomy groups of pseudo-quaternionic-K\"ahlerian manifolds of non-zero scalar curvature.
