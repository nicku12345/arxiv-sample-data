Motivated by Felix Klein's notion that geometry is governed by its group of symmetry transformations, Charles Ehresmann initiated the study of geometric structures on topological spaces locally modeled on a homogeneous space of a Lie group. These locally homogeneous spaces later formed the context of Thurston's 3-dimensional geometrization program. The basic problem is for a given topology S and a geometry X = G/H, to classify all the possible ways of introducing the local geometry of G/H into S. For example, a sphere admits no local Euclidean geometry: there is no metrically accurate Euclidean atlas of the earth. One develops a space whose points are equivalence classes of geometric structures on S, which itself exhibits a rich geometry and symmetries arising from the topological symmetries of S. In this talk I will survey several examples of the classification of locally homogeneous geometric structures on manifolds in low dimension, and how it leads to a general study of surface group representations. In particular geometric structures are a useful tool in understanding local and global properties of deformation spaces of representations of fundamental groups.
