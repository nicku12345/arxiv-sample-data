We study polar actions with horizontal sections on the total space of certain principal bundles G/K\to G/H with base a symmetric space of compact type. We classify such actions up to orbit equivalence in many cases. In particular, we exhibit examples of hyperpolar actions with cohomogeneity greater than one on locally irreducible homogeneous spaces with nonnegative curvature which are not homeomorphic to symmetric spaces.
