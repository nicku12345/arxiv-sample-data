The holonomy algebra of a pseudo-hyper-K\"ahlerian manifold of signature (4,4n+4) is a subalgebra of \sp(1,n+1). Possible holonomy algebras of these manifolds are classified. Using this, a new proof of the classification of simply connected pseudo-hyper-K\"ahlerian symmetric spaces of index 4 is obtained.
