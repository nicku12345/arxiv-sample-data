In this paper, as the second in our series of papers on differential geometry of microlinear Frolicher spaces, we study differenital forms. The principal result is that the exterior differentiation is uniquely determined geometrically, just as grad (ient), div (ergence) and rot (ation) are uniquely determined geometrically or physically in classical vector calculus. This infinitesimal characterization of exterior differentiation has been completely missing in orthodox differential geometry.
