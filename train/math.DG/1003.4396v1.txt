This work is devoted to the study of Einstein equations with a special shape of the energy-momentum tensor. Our results continue Stepanov's classification of Riemannian manifolds according to special properties of the energy-momentum tensor to K\"ahler manifolds. We show that in this case the number of classes reduces.
