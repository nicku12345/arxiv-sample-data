In this work, we consider spacelike surfaces in Minkowski space \hbox{\bf E}%_{1}^{3} that satisfy a linear Weingarten condition of type \kappa_{1}=m\kappa_{2}+n, where m and n are constant and \kappa_{1} and \kappa_{2} denote the principal curvatures at each point of the surface. We study the family of surfaces foliated by a uniparametric family of circles in parallel planes. We prove that the surface must be rotational or the surface is part of the family of Riemann examples of maximal surfaces (m=-1, n=0). Finally, we consider the class of rotational surfaces for the case n=0, obtaining a first integration if the axis is timelike and spacelike and a complete description if the axis is lightlike.
