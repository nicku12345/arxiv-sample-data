In this work, we study spacelike and timelike surfaces of revolution in Minkowski space \e_{1}^{3} that satisfy aH+bK=c, where H and K denote the mean curvature and the Gauss curvature of the surface and a, b and c are constants. The classification depends on the causal character of the axis of revolution and in all the cases, we obtain a first integral of the equation of the generating curve of the surface.
