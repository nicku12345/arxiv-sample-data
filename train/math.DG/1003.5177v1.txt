We study the geometry of multidimensional scalar 2^{nd} order PDEs (i.e. PDEs with n independent variables) with one unknown function, viewed as hypersurfaces \mathcal{E} in the Lagrangian Grassmann bundle M^{(1)} over a (2n+1)-dimensional contact manifold (M,\mathcal{C}). We develop the theory of characteristics of the equation \mathcal{E} in terms of contact geometry and of the geometry of Lagrangian Grassmannian and study their relationship with intermediate integrals of \mathcal{E}. After specifying the results to general Monge-Amp\`ere equations (MAEs), we focus our attention to MAEs of type introduced by Goursat, i.e. MAEs of the form  \det|\frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x^i\partial x^j}-b_{ij}(x,f,\nabla f)\|=0.  We show that any MAE of the aforementioned class is associated with an n-dimensional subdistribution \mathcal{D} of the contact distribution \mathcal{C}, and viceversa. We characterize this Goursat-type equations together with its intermediate integrals in terms of their characteristics and give a criterion of local contact equivalence. Finally, we develop a method of solutions of a Cauchy problem, provided the existence of a suitable number of intermediate integrals.
