In this paper we construct Mabuchi \mathcal{L}^{{\rm M}}_{\omega} functional and Aubin-Yau functionals \mathcal{I}^{{\rm AY}}_{\omega}, \mathcal{J}^{{\rm AY}}_{\omega} on any compact complex three-folds. The method presented here will be used in the forthcoming paper \cite{L1} on the construction of those functionals on any compact complex manifolds, which generalizes the previous work \cite{L}.
