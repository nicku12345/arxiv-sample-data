We generalize the concept of locally symmetric spaces to parabolic contact structures. We show that symmetric normal parabolic contact structures are torsion--free and some types of them have to be locally flat. We prove that each symmetry given at a point with non--zero harmonic curvature is involutive. Finally we give restrictions on number of different symmetries which can exist at such a point.
