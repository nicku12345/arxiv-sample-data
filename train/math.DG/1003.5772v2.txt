Let M be a connected, non-compact m-dimensional Riemannian manifold. In this paper we consider smooth maps \phi: M \to \mathbb{R}^n with images inside a non-degenerate cone. Under quite general assumptions on M, we provide a lower bound for the width of the cone in terms of the energy and the tension of \phi and a metric parameter. As a side product, we recover some well known results concerning harmonic maps, minimal immersions and K\"ahler submanifolds. In case \phi is an isometric immersion, we also show that, if M is sufficiently well-behaved and has non-positive sectional curvature, \phi(M) cannot be contained into a non-degenerate cone of \mathbb{R}^{2m-1}.
