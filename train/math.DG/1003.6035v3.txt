Let f:M\ra \erre^{m+1} be an isometrically immersed hypersurface. In this paper, we exploit recent results due to the authors in \cite{bimari} to analyze the stability of the differential operator L_r associated with the r-th Newton tensor of f. This appears in the Jacobi operator for the variational problem of minimizing the r-mean curvature H_r. Two natural applications are found. The first one ensures that, under the mild condition that the integral of H_r over geodesic spheres grows sufficiently fast, the Gauss map meets each equator of \esse^m infinitely many times. The second one deals with hypersurfaces with zero (r+1)-mean curvature. Under similar growth assumptions, we prove that the affine tangent spaces f_*T_pM, p\in M, fill the whole \erre^{m+1}.
