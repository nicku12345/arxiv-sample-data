A regular normal parabolic geometry of type G/P on a manifold M gives rise to sequences D_i of invariant differential operators, known as the curved version of the BGG resolution. These sequences are constructed from the normal covariant derivative \na^\om on the corresponding tractor bundle V, where \om is the normal Cartan connection. The first operator D_0 in the sequence is overdetermined and it is well known that \na^\om yields the prolongation of this operator in the homogeneous case M = G/P. Our first main result is the curved version of such a prolongation. This requires a new normalization \tilde{\na} of the tractor covariant derivative on V. Moreover, we obtain an analogue for higher operators D_i. In that case one needs to modify the exterior covariant derivative d^{\na^\om} by differential terms. Finally we demonstrate these results on simple examples in projective and Grassmannian geometry. Our approach is based on standard techniques of the BGG machinery.
