In this note several computations of equivariant cohomology groups are performed. For the compactly supported equivariant cohomology, the notion of infinitesimal index developed in arXiv:1003.3525, allows to describe these groups in terms of certain spaces of distributions arising in the theory of splines.   The new version contains a large number of improvements.
