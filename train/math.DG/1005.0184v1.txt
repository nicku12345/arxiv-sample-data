A structure on an almost contact metric manifold is defined as a generalization of well-known cases: Sasakian, quasi-Sasakian, Kenmotsu and cosymplectic. Then we consider a semi-invariant \xi^{\bot}-submanifold of a manifold endowed with such a structure and two topics are studied: the integrability of distributions defined by this submanifold and characterizations for the totally umbilical case. In particular we recover results of Kenmotsu, Eum and Papaghiuc.
