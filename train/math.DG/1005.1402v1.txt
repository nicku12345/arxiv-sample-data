In this paper we construct the differential equations of the stream lines that characterize plasma regarded as a non-isotropic medium geometrized by a jet rheonomic time-invariant Berwald-Moor metric. Section 1 contains historical notes regarding the Plasma Physics and its geometrical description. Section 2 analyzes the generalized Lagrange geometrical approach of the non-isotropic plasma on 1-jet spaces. Section 3 studies the non-isotropic plasma as a medium geometrized by the jet rheonomic Berwald-Moor metric.
