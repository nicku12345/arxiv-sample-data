By using a Borel density theorem for algebraic quotients, we prove a theorem concerning isometric actions of a Lie group G on a smooth or analytic manifold M with a rigid \mathrm{A}-structure \sigma. It generalizes Gromov's centralizer and representation theorems to the case where R(G) is split solvable and G/R(G) has no compact factors, strengthens a special case of Gromov's open dense orbit theorem, and implies that for smooth M and simple G, if Gromov's representation theorem does not hold, then the local Killing fields on \widetilde{M} are highly non-extendable. As applications of the generalized centralizer and representation theorems, we prove (1) a structural property of \mathrm{Iso}(M) for simply connected compact analytic M with unimodular \sigma, (2) three results illustrating the phenomena that if G is split solvable and large then \pi_1(M) is also large, and (3) two fixed point theorems for split solvable G and compact analytic M with non-unimodular \sigma.
