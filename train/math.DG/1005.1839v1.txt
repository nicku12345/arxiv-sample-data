We give a number of examples of isospectral pairs of plane domains, and a particularly simple method of proving isospectrality. One of our examples is a pair of domains that are not only isospectral but homophonic: Each domain has a distinguished point such that corresponding normalized Dirichlet eigenfunctions take equal values at the distinguished points. This shows that one really can't hear the shape of a drum.
