A classical problem in constant mean curvature hypersurface theory is, for given H\geq 0, to determine whether a compact submanifold \Gamma^{n-1} of codimension two in Euclidean space \R_+^{n+1}, having a single valued orthogonal projection on \R^n, is the boundary of a graph with constant mean curvature H over a domain in \R^n. A well known result of Serrin gives a sufficient condition, namely, \Gamma is contained in a right cylinder C orthogonal to \R^n with inner mean curvature H_C\geq H. In this paper, we prove existence and uniqueness if the orthogonal projection L^{n-1} of \Gamma on \R^n has mean curvature H_L\geq-H and \Gamma is contained in a cone K with basis in \R^n enclosing a domain in \R^n containing L such that the mean curvature of K satisfies H_K\geq H. Our condition reduces to Serrin's when the vertex of the cone is infinite.
