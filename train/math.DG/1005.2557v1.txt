A new differentiable sphere theorem is obtained from the view of submanifold geometry. An important scalar is defined by the scalar curvature and the mean curvature of an oriented complete submanifold M^n in a space form F^{n+p}(c) with c\ge0. Making use of the Hamilton-Brendle-Schoen convergence result for Ricci flow and the Lawson-Simons-Xin formula for the nonexistence of stable currents, we prove that if the infimum of this scalar is positive, then M is diffeomorphic to S^n. We then introduce an intrinsic invariant I(M) for oriented complete Riemannian n-manifold M via the scalar, and prove that if I(M)>0, then M is diffeomorphic to S^n. It should be emphasized that our differentiable sphere theorem is optimal for arbitrary n(\ge2).
