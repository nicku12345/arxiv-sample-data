In this study, we give the dual characterizations of Mannheim offsets of the ruled surface in terms of their integral invariants and the new characterization of the Mannheim offsets of developable surface. Furthermore, we obtain the relationships between the area of projections of spherical images for Mannheim offsets of ruled surfaces and their integral invariants.
