In this paper, using Riemann-Lagrange geometrical methods, we construct a geometrical model on 1-jet spaces for the study of multi-time relativistic magnetized non-viscous plasma, characterized by a given energy-stress-momentum distinguished (d-) tensor. In that arena, we give the conservation laws and the continuity equations for multi-time plasma. The partial differential equations of the stream sheets (the equivalent of stream lines in the classical semi-Riemannian geometrical approach of plasma) for multi-time plasma are also written.
