This paper is concerned with the holonomy of a class of spaces which includes Landsberg spaces of Finsler geometry. The methods used are those of Lie groupoids and algebroids as developed by Mackenzie. We prove a version of the Ambrose-Singer Theorem for such spaces. The paper ends with a discussion of how the results may be extended to Finsler spaces and homogeneous nonlinear connections in general.
