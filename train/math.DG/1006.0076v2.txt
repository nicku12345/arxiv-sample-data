We introduce semi-invariant Riemannian submersions from almost Hermitian manifolds onto Riemannian manifolds. We give examples, investigate the geometry of foliations which are arisen from the definition of a Riemannian submersion and find necessary-sufficient conditions for total manifold to be locally product Riemannian manifold. We also find necessary and sufficient conditions for a semi-invariant submersion to be totally geodesic. Moreover, we obtain a classification for semi-invariant submersions with totally umbilical fibers and show that such submersions put some restrictions on total manifolds.
