We introduce slant submersions from almost Hermitian manifolds onto Riemannian manifolds. We give examples, investigate the geometry of foliations which are arisen from the definition of a Riemannian submersion and check the harmonicity of such submersions. We also find necessary and sufficient conditions for a slant submersion to be totally geodesic. Moreover, we obtain a decomposition theorem for the total manifold of such submersions.
