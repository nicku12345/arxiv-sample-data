In this paper, we study Jacobi operators associated to algebraic curvature maps (tensors) on lightlike submanifolds M. We investigate conditions for an induced Rie- mann curvature tensor to be an algebraic curvature tensor on M. We introduce the notion of lightlike Osserman submanifolds and an example of 2-degenerate Osserman metric is given. Finally we give some results of symmetry properties on lightlike hy- persurfaces from Osserman condition.
