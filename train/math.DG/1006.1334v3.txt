On compact manifolds which are not simply connected, we prove the existence of "fake" solutions to the optimal transportion problem. These maps preserve volume and arise as the exponential of a closed 1 form, hence appear geometrically like optimal transport maps. The set of such solutions forms a manifold with dimension given by the first Betti number of the manifold. In the process, we prove a Hodge-Helmholtz decomposition for vector fields. The ideas are motivated by the analogies between special Lagrangian submanifolds and solutions to optimal transport problems.
