The special isothermic surfaces, discovered by Darboux in connection with deformations of quadrics, admit a simple explanation via the gauge-theoretic approach to isothermic surfaces. We find that they fit into a heirarchy of special classes of isothermic surface and extend the theory to arbitrary codimension.
