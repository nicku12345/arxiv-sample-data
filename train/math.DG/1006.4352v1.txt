The paper is concerned with defining a topology on the set of ideals of codimension d of the algebra C^\infty(M,R) with M being a compact smooth manifold. Its main property is that it is compact Hausdorff and it contains as a subspace the configuration space of d distinct unordered points in M and therefore provides a "compactification" of this configuration space. It naturally forms a space over the symmetric product SP_d(M) and as such has a very rich structure. Moreover it is covered by a (naturally defined) set of charts in which it is semialgebraic.
