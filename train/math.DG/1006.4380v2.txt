For a regular surface in Euclidean space \mathbb{R}^3, umbilic points are precisely the points where the Gauss and mean curvatures K and H satisfy H^2=K; moreover, it is well-known that the only totally umbilic surfaces in \mathbb{R}^3 are planes and spheres. But for timelike surfaces in Minkowski space \mathbb{R}^{1,2}, it is possible to have H^2=K at a non-umbilic point; we call such points {\em quasi-umbilic}, and we give a complete classification of totally quasi-umbilic timelike surfaces in \mathbb{R}^{1,2}.
