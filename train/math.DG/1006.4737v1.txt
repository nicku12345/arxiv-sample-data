The Eisenhart problem of finding parallel tensors treated already in the framework of quasi-constant curvature manifolds in \cite{x:j} is reconsidered for the symmetric case and the result is interpreted in terms of Ricci solitons. If the generator of the manifold provides a Ricci soliton then this is i) expanding on para-Sasakian spaces with constant scalar curvature and vanishing D-concircular tensor field and ii) shrinking on a class of orientable quasi-umbilical hypersurfaces of a real projective space=elliptic space form.
