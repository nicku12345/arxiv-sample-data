In this note we establish several versions of a compactness theorem for submanifolds. In particular we require only bounds on the second fundamental form and do not assume volume or diameter bounds. As an application we prove a compactness theorem for mean curvature flows and use it to construct smooth blow-up limits as singularity models.
