We construct pairs of compact K\"ahler-Einstein manifolds (M_i,g_i,\omega_i) (i=1,2) of complex dimension n with the following properties: The canonical line bundle L_i=\bigwedge^n T^*M_i has Chern class [\omega_i/2\pi], and for each integer k the tensor powers L_1^{\otimes k} and L_2^{\otimes k} are isospectral for the bundle Laplacian associated with the canonical connection, while M_1 and M_2 -- and hence T^*M_1 and T^*M_2 -- are not homeomorphic. In the context of geometric quantization, we interpret these examples as magnetic fields which are quantum equivalent but not classically equivalent. Moreover, we construct many examples of line bundles L, pairs of potentials Q_1, Q_2 on the base manifold, and pairs of connections \nabla_1, \nabla_2 on L such that for each integer k the associated Schr\"odinger operators on L^{\otimes k} are isospectral.
