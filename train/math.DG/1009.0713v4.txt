Let (G\rr P, \mathsf D_G) be a Dirac groupoid. We show that there are natural Lie algebroid structures on the units \lie A(\mathsf D_G) and on the core I^\tg(\mathsf D_G) of the multiplicative Dirac structure. In the Poisson case, the Lie algebroid A^*G is isomorphic to \lie A(\mathsf D_G) and in the case of a closed 2-form, the IM-2-form is equivalent to the core algebroid that we find. We construct a vector bundle \lie B(\mathsf D_G)\to P associated to any (almost) Dirac structure. In the Dirac case, \lie B(\mathsf D_G) has the structure of a Courant algebroid that generalizes the Courant algebroid defined by the Lie bialgebroid of a Poisson groupoid. This Courant algebroid structure is induced in a natural way by the ambient Courant algebroid TG\oplus T^*G. The already known theorems about one-one correspondence between the homogeneous spaces of a Poisson Lie group (respectively Poisson groupoid, Dirac Lie group) and suitable Lagrangian subspaces of the Lie bialgebra or Lie bialgebroid are generalized to a classification of the Dirac homogeneous spaces of a Dirac groupoid. \mathsf D_G-homogeneous Dirac structures on G/H are related to suitable Dirac structures in \lie B(\mathsf D_G). In the case of almost Dirac structures, we find Lagrangian subspaces of \lie B(D_G), that are invariant under an induced action of the bisections of H on \lie B(\mathsf D_G).
