Of all real Lagrangian--Grassmannians LG(n,2n), only LG(2,4) admits a distinguished (Lorentzian) conformal structure and hence is identified with the indefinite M\"obius space S^{1,2}. Using Cartan's method of moving frames, we study hyperbolic (timelike) surfaces in LG(2,4) modulo the conformal symplectic group CSp(4,R). This CSp(4,R)-invariant classification is also a contact-invariant classification of (in general, highly non-linear) second order scalar hyperbolic PDE in the plane. Via LG(2,4), we give a simple geometric argument for the invariance of the general hyperbolic Monge--Amp\`ere equation and the relative invariants which characterize it. For hyperbolic PDE of non-Monge--Amp\`ere type, we demonstrate the existence of a geometrically associated ``conjugate'' PDE. Finally, we give the first known example of a Dupin cyclide in a Lorentzian space.
