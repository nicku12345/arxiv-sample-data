BGG-equations are geometric overdetermined systems of PDEs on parabolic geometries. Normal solutions of BGG-equations are particularly interesting and we give a simple formula for the necessary and sufficient additional integrability conditions on a solution. We then discuss a procedure for coupling known solutions of BGG-equations to produce new ones. Employing a suitable calculus for conformal spin structures this yields explicit coupling formulas and conditions between almost Einstein scales, conformal Killing forms and twistor spinors. Finally we discuss a class of generic twistor spinors that provides an invariant decomposition of conformal Killing fields.
