We prove that hypersurfaces of \R^{n+1} which are almost extremal for the Reilly inequality on \lambda_1 and have L^p-bounded mean curvature (p>n) are Hausdorff close to a sphere, have almost constant mean curvature and have a spectrum which asymptotically contains the spectrum of the sphere. We prove the same result for the Hasanis-Koutroufiotis inequality on extrinsic radius. We also prove that when a supplementary L^q bound on the second fundamental is assumed, the almost extremal manifolds are Lipschitz close to a sphere when q>n, but not necessarily diffeomorphic to a sphere when q\leqslant n.
