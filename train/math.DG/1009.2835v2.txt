Given an integer homology class of a finitely presentable group, the systolic volume quantifies how tight could be a geometric realization of this class. In this paper, we study various aspects of this numerical invariant showing that it is a complex and powerful tool to investigate topological properties of homology classes of finitely presentable groups.
