In this paper, we parametrize the space of isometric immersions of the hyperbolic plane into the hyperbolic 3-space in terms of null-causal curves in the space of oriented geodesics. Moreover, we characterize "ideal cones" (i.e., cones whose vertices are on the ideal boundary) by behavior of their mean curvature.
