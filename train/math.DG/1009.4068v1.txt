Preliminary group classification for a class of generalized inviscid Burger's equations in the general form u_t+g(x, u)u_x = f(x, u) is given and additional equivalence transformations are found. Adduced results complete and essentially generalize recent works on the subject . A number of new interesting nonlinear invariant models which have non-trivial invariance algebras are obtained. The result of the work is a wide class of equations summarized in table form.
