In this paper we find examples of slant surfaces in the nearly Kahler six sphere. First, we characterize two-dimensional small and great spheres which are slant. Their description is given in terms of the associative 3-form in \Im \OO . Later on, we classify the slant surfaces of S^6 which are orbits of maximal torus in G_2. We show that these orbits are flat tori which are linearly full in S^5\subset S^6 and that their slant angle is between \arccos \frac{1}{3} and \frac{\pi}{2}. Among them we find one parameter family of minimal orbits.
