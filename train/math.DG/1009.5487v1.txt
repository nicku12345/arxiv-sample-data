We investigate the Lawson genus 2 surface by methods from integrable system theory. We prove that the associated family of flat connections comes from a family of flat connections on a 4-punctured sphere. We describe the symmetries of the holonomy and show that it is already determined by the holonomy around one of the punctures. We show the existence of a meromorphic DPW potential for the Lawson surface which is globally defined on the surface. We determine this potential explicitly up to two unknown functions depending only on the spectral parameter.
