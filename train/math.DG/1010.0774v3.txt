In this paper, we determine the maximally stable, rotationally invariant domains on the catenoids \cC_a (minimal surfaces invariant by rotations) in the Heisenberg group with a left-invariant metric. We show that these catenoids have Morse index at least 3 and we bound the index from above in terms of the parameter a. We also show that the index of \cC_a tends to infinity with a. Finally, we study the rotationally symmetric stable domains on the higher dimensional catenoids.
