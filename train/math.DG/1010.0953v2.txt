Let x:M\to\mathbb{S}^{n+1}(1) be an n-dimensional compact hypersurface with constant scalar curvature n(n-1)r,~r\geq 1, in a unit sphere \mathbb{S}^{n+1}(1),~n\geq 5. We know that such hypersurfaces can be characterized as critical points for a variational problem of the integral \int_MH dv of the mean curvature H. In this paper, we derive an optimal upper bound for the second eigenvalue of the Jacobi operator J_s of M. Moreover, when r>1, the bound is attained if and only if M is totally umbilical and non-totally geodesic, when r=1, the bound is attained if M is the Riemannian product \mathbb{S}^{m}(c)\times\mathbb{S}^{n-m}(\sqrt{1-c^2}),~1\leq m\leq n-2,~c=\sqrt{\frac{(n-1)m+\sqrt{(n-1)m(n-m)}}{n(n-1)}}.
