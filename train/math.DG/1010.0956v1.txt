Starting from two Lagrangian immersions and a Legendre curve \tilde{\gamma}(t) in \mathbb{S}^3(1) (or in \mathbb{H}_1^3(1)), it is possible to construct a new Lagrangian immersion in \mathbb{CP}^n (or in \mathbb{CH}^n), which is called a warped product Lagrangian immersion. When \tilde{\gamma}(t)=(r_1e^{i(\frac{r_2}{r_1}at)}, r_2e^{i(- \frac{r_1}{r_2}at)}) (or \tilde{\gamma}(t)=(r_1e^{i(\frac{r_2}{r_1}at)}, r_2e^{i(\frac{r_1}{r_2}at)})), where r_1, r_2, and a are positive constants with r_1^2+r_2^2=1 (or -r_1^2+r_2^2=-1), we call the new Lagrangian immersion a Calabi product Lagrangian immersion. In this paper, we study the inverse problem: how to determine from the properties of the second fundamental form whether a given Lagrangian immersion of \mathbb{CP}^n or \mathbb{CH}^n is a Calabi product Lagrangian immersion. When the Calabi product is minimal, or is Hamiltonian minimal, or has parallel second fundamental form, we give some further characterizations.
