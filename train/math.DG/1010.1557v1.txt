We study surfaces with constant anisotropic mean curvature which are invariant under a helicoidal motion. For functionals with axially symmetric Wulff shapes, we generalize the recently developed twizzler representation of Perdomo to the anisotropic case and show how all helicoidal constant anisotropic mean curvature surfaces can be obtained by quadratures.
