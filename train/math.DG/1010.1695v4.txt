An SU(3)- or SU(1,2)-structure on a 6-dimensional manifold N^6 can be defined as a pair of a 2-form omega and a 3-form rho. We prove that any analytic SU(3)- or SU(1,2)-structure on N^6 with d omega^2 =0 can be extended to a parallel Spin(7)- or Spin_0(3,4)-structure Phi that is defined on the trivial disc bundle N^6\times B_epsilon(0) for a sufficiently small epsilon>0. Furthermore, we show by an example that Phi is not uniquely determined by (omega,rho) and discuss if our result can be generalized to non-trivial bundles.
