We develop a degree theory for compact immersed hypersurfaces of prescribed K-curvature immersed in a compact, orientable Riemannian manifold, where K is any elliptic curvature function. We apply this theory to count the (algebraic) number of immersed hyperspheres in various cases: where K is mean curvature; extrinsic curvature and special Lagrangian curvature, and we show that in all these cases, this number is equal to -\chi(M), where \chi(M) is the Euler characteristic of M.
