This survey article is about discrete constant mean curvature surfaces defined by an approach related to integrable systems techniques. We introduce the notion of discrete constant mean curvature surfaces by first introducing properties of smooth constant mean curvature surfaces. We describe the mathematical structure of the smooth surfaces using conserved quantities, which can be converted into a discrete theory in a natural way.
