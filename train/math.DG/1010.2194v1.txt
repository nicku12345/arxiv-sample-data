A parallel lightlike vector field on a Lorentzian manifold X naturally defines a foliation \mathcal{F} of codimension one. If either all leaves of \mathcal{F} are compact or X itself is compact admitting a compact leaf and the (transverse) Ricci curvature is non-negative then a Bochner type argument implies that the first Betti number of X is bounded by 1 \leq b_{1} \leq \dim X if X is compact and 0 \leq b_{1} \leq \dim X -1 otherwise. We show that these bounds are optimal and depending on the holonomy of X we obtain further results. Finally, we classify the holonomy representations for those X admitting a compact leaf with finite fundamental group.
