For a compact spacelike constant mean curvature surface with nonempty boundary in the three-dimensional Lorentz-Minkowski space, we introduce a rotation index of the lines of curvature at the boundary umbilic point, which was developed by Choe \cite{Choe}. Using the concept of the rotation index at the interior and boundary umbilic points and applying the Poincar\'{e}-Hopf index formula, we prove that a compact immersed spacelike disk type capillary surface with less than 4 vertices in a domain of \Bbb L^3 bounded by (spacelike or timelike) totally umbilic surfaces is part of a (spacelike) plane or a hyperbolic plane. Moreover we prove that the only immersed spacelike disk type capillary surface inside de Sitter surface in \Bbb L^3 is part of (spacelike) plane or a hyperbolic plane.
