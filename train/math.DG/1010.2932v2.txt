We classify hypersurfaces of rank two of Euclidean space \R^{n+1} that admit genuine isometric deformations in \R^{n+2}. That an isometric immersion \hat f\colon\,M^n\to\R^{n+2} is a genuine isometric deformation of a hypersurface f\colon\, M^n\to\R^{n+1} means that \hat f is nowhere a composition \hat f=\hat F\circ f, where \hat F\colon\,V\subset \R^{n+1}\to\R^{n+2} is an isometric immersion of an open subset V containing f(M).
