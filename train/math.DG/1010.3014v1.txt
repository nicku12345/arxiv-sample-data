We prove a Milnor-Wood inequality for representations of the fundamental group of a compact complex hyperbolic manifold in the group of isometries of quaternionic hyperbolic space. Of special interest is the case of equality, and its application to rigidity. We show that equality can only be achieved for totally geodesic representations, thereby establishing a global rigidity theorem for totally geodesic representations.
