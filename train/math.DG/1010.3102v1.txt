In this note, we obtain the sharp estimates for the first eigenvalue of Paneitz operator for 4-dimensional compact submanifolds in Euclidean space. Since unit spheres and projective spaces can be canonically imbedded into Euclidean space, the corresponding estimates for the first eigenvalue are also obtained.
