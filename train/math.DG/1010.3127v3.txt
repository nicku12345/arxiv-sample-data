We show that if a smooth multiplicative subbundle S\subseteq TG on a groupoid G\rr P is involutive and satisfies completeness conditions, then its leaf space G/S inherits a groupoid structure over the space of leaves of TP\cap S in P.   As an application, a special class of Dirac groupoids is shown to project by forward Dirac maps to Poisson groupoids.
