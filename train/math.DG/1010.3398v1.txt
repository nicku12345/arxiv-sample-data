Let M be a paracompact differentiable manifold, A a local algebra and M^{A} a manifold of infinitely near points on M of kind A. We define the notion of A-Poisson manifold on M^{A}. We show that when M is a Poisson manifold, then M^{A} is an A-Poisson manifold. We also show that if (M,) is a symplectic manifold, the structure of A-Poisson manifold on M^{A} defined by ^{A} coincide with the prolongation on M^{A} of the Poisson structure on M defined by the symplectic form.
