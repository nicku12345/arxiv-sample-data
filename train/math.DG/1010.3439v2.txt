If f is a smooth function on a Hodge manifold, we construct a canonical sequence of real algebraic functions that converge to f in the smooth topology. The definition of of the approximants is inspired by Berezin-Toeplitz quantization. The proof follows quickly from known results of Fine, Liu and Ma.
