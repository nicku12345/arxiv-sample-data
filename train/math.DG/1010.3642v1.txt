We estimate from below the isoperimetric profile of S^2 \times \re^2 and use this information to obtain lower bounds for the Yamabe constant of S^2 \times \re^2. This provides a lower bound for the Yamabe invariants of products S^2 \times M^2 for any closed Riemann surface M. Explicitly we show that Y(S^2 \times M^2) > (2/3) Y(S^4).
