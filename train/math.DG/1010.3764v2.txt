We define and study a M\"obius invariant energy associated to planar domains, as well its generalization to space curves. This generalization is a M\"obius version of Banchoff-Pohl's notion of area enclosed by a space curve. A relation with Gauss-Bonnet theorems for complete surfaces in hyperbolic space is also described.
