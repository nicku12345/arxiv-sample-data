A weakly Einstein manifold is a generalization of a 4-dimensional Einstein manifold, which is defined as an application of a curvature identity derived from the generalized Gauss-Bonnet formula for a 4-dimensional compact oriented Riemannian manifold. In this paper, we shall give a characterization of a weakly Einstein manifold.
