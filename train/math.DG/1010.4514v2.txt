We prove existence and partial regularity of integral rectifiable m-dimensional varifolds minimizing functionals of the type \int |H|^p and \int |A|^p in a given Riemannian n-dimensional manifold (N,g), 2\leq m<n and p>m, under suitable assumptions on N (in the end of the paper we give many examples of such ambient manifolds). To this aim we introduce the following new tools: some monotonicity formulas for varifolds in \mathbb{R}^S involving \int |H|^p, to avoid degeneracy of the minimizer, and a sort of isoperimetric inequality to bound the mass in terms of the mentioned functionals.
