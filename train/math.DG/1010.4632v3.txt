To give a criterion for the integrability of Banach-Lie triple systems, we follow the construction of the period group of a Lie algebra and define the period group of a Lie triple system as an analogous concept. We show that a Lie triple system is integrable if and only if its period group is discrete. Along the way, we see how to turn the path and the loop space of a pointed symmetric space into pointed symmetric spaces.
