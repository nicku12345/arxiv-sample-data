The aim of this paper is to complete the local classification of minimal hypersurfaces with vanishing Gauss-Kronecker curvature in a 4-dimensional space form. Moreover, we give a classification of complete minimal hypersurfaces with vanishing Gauss-Kronecker curvature and scalar curvature bounded from below.
