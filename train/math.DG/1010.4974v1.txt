For all m \in \mathbb N - \{0\}, we prove the existence of a one dimensional family of genus m, constant mean curvature (equal to 1) surfaces which are complete, immersed in \mathbb R^3 and have two Delaunay ends asymptotic to nodo\"{\i}dal ends. Moreover, these surfaces are invariant under the group of isometries of \mathbb R^3 leaving a horizontal regular polygon with m+1 sides fixed.
