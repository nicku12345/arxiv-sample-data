We consider local invariants of general connections (with torsion). The group of origin-preserving diffeomorphisms acts on a space of jets of general connections. Dimensions of moduli spaces of generic connections are calculated. Poincar\'e series of the geometric structure of connection is constructed, and shown to be a rational function, confirming the finiteness assertion of Tresse.
