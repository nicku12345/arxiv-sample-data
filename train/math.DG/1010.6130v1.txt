In this paper, we will show that the limit of some quasilocal mass integrals of the coordinate spheres in an asymptotically hyperbolic (AH) manifold is the mass integral of the AH manifold. This is the analogue of the well known result that the limit of the Brown-York mass of coordinate spheres is the ADM mass in an asymptotically flat manifold.
