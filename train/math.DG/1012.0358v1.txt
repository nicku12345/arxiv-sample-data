In this paper, we show that one can interrelate pluriharmonic maps with para-pluriharmonic maps by means of the loop group method. As an appendix, we give examples for the interrelation between pluriharmonic maps and para-pluriharmonic maps. Moreover, we investigate the relation among CMC-surfaces by use of such maps.
