We obtain in this paper bounds for the capacity of a compact set K. If K is contained in an (n+1)-dimensional Cartan-Hadamard manifold, has smooth boundary, and the principal curvatures of \partial K are larger than or equal to H_0>0, then {\rm Cap}(K)\geq (n-1)\,H_0{\rm vol}(\partial K). When K is contained in an (n+1)-dimensional manifold with non-negative Ricci curvature, has smooth boundary, and the mean curvature of \partial K is smaller than or equal to H_0, we prove the inequality {\rm Cap}(K)\leq (n-1)\,H_0{\rm vol}(\partial K). In both cases we are able to characterize the equality case. Finally, if K is a convex set in Euclidean space \mathbb{R}^{n+1} which admits a supporting sphere of radius H_0^{-1} at any boundary point, then we prove {\rm Cap}(K)\geq (n-1)\,H_0\mathcal{H}^n(\partial K) and that equality holds for the round sphere of radius H_0^{-1}.
