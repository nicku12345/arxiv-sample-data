We study the class of spacelike surfaces in the four-dimensional Minkowski space whose mean curvature vector at any point is a non-zero spacelike vector or timelike vector. These surfaces are determined up to a motion by eight invariant functions satisfying some natural conditions. The subclass of Chen surfaces is characterized by the condition one of these invariants to be zero. In the present paper we describe all Chen spacelike rotational surfaces of hyperbolic or elliptic type.
