In this article we develop a new approach to the problem of the stability of locally conformally K\"ahler structures (l.c.k structures) under small deformations of complex structures and deformations of flat line bundles. We show that under the certain cohomological condition the stability of l.c.k structures does hold. We apply our approach to Hopf manifolds and its generalizations to obtain the stability of l.c.k structures which do not have potential in general. We give an explicit description of the cohomological obstructions of the stability of l.c.k structures on Inoue surfaces with b_2=0.
