We use the supergeometric formalism, more precisely, the so-called "big bracket" (for which brackets and anchors are encoded by functions on some graded symplectic manifold) to address the theory of Jacobi algebroids and bialgebroids (following mainly Iglesias-Marrero and Grabowski-Marmo as a guideline). This formalism is in particular efficient to define the Jacobi-Gerstenhaber algebra structure associated to a Jacobi algebroid, to define its Poissonization, and to express the compatibility condition defining Jacobi bialgebroids. Also, we claim that this supergeometric language gives a simple description of the Jacobi bialgebroid associated to Jacobi structures, and conversely, of the Jacobi structure associated to Jacobi bialgebroid.
