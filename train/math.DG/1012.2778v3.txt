We study hypersurfaces either in the De Sitter space \S_1^{n+1}\subset\R_1^{n+2} or in the anti De Sitter space \H_1^{n+1}\subset\R_2^{n+2} whose position vector \psi satisfies the condition L_k\psi=A\psi+b, where L_k is the linearized operator of the (k+1)-th mean curvature of the hypersurface, for a fixed k=0,...,n-1, A is an (n+2)\times(n+2) constant matrix and b is a constant vector in the corresponding pseudo-Euclidean space. For every k, we prove that when A is self-adjoint and b=0, the only hypersurfaces satisfying that condition are hypersurfaces with zero (k+1)-th mean curvature and constant k-th mean curvature, open pieces of standard pseudo-Riemannian products in \S_1^{n+1} (\S_1^m(r)\times\S^{n-m}(\sqrt{1-r^2}), \H^m(-r)\times\S^{n-m}(\sqrt{1+r^2}), \S_1^m(\sqrt{1-r^2})\times\S^{n-m}(r), \H^m(-\sqrt{r^2-1})\times\S^{n-m}(r)), open pieces of standard pseudo-Riemannian products in \H_1^{n+1} (\H_1^m(-r)\times\S^{n-m}(\sqrt{r^2-1}), \H^m(-\sqrt{1+r^2})\times\S_1^{n-m}(r), \S_1^m(\sqrt{r^2-1})\times\H^{n-m}(-r), \H^m(-\sqrt{1-r^2})\times\H^{n-m}(-r)) and open pieces of a quadratic hypersurface \{x\in\mathbb{M}_{c}^{n+1}\;|\;Rx,x=d\}, where R is a self-adjoint constant matrix whose minimal polynomial is t^2+at+b, a^2-4b\leq 0, and \mathbb{M}_{c}^{n+1} stands for \S_1^{n+1}\subset\R_1^{n+2} or \H_1^{n+1}\subset\R_2^{n+2}. When H_k is constant and b is a non-zero constant vector, we show that the hypersurface is totally umbilical, and then we also obtain a classification result (see Theorem 2).
