For simply connected compact exceptional Lie groups G = F_4, E_6 and E_7, we consider two involutions \sigma, \gamma and determine the group structure of subgroups G^{\sigma,\gamma} of G which are the intersection G^\sigma \cap G^{\gamma} of the fixed points subgroups of G^\sigma and G^{\gamma}. The motivation is as follows. In [1](see the References of this paper), we determine the group structure of (F_4)^{\sigma, \sigma'}, (E_6)^{\sigma, \sigma'} and (E_7)^{\sigma, \sigma'}, and in [2](see the References of this paper), we also determine the group structure of (G_2)^{\gamma, \gamma'}, (F_4)^{\gamma, \gamma'} and (E_6)^{\gamma, \gamma'}. So, in this paper, we try to determine the type of groups (F_4)^{\sigma, \gamma}, (E_6)^{\sigma, \gamma} and (E_7)^{\sigma, \gamma}.
