For the simply connected compact exceptional Lie group E_8, we determine the structure of subgroup (E_8)^{\sigma, \sigma'} of E_8 which is the intersection (E_8)^\sigma \cap (E_8)^{\sigma'}. Then the space E_8/(E_8)^{\sigma, \sigma'} is the exceptional \mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2- symmetric space of type EVIII-VIII-VIII, and that we give two involutions \sigma, \sigma' for the space E_8/(E_8)^{\sigma, \sigma'} concretely.
