We find new examples of compact Spin(7)-manifolds using a construction of Joyce. The essential ingredient in Joyce's construction is a Calabi-Yau 4-orbifold with particular singularities admitting an antiholomorphic involution, which fixes the singularities. We search the class of well-formed quasismooth hypersurfaces in weighted projective spaces for suitable Calabi-Yau 4-orbifolds. We find that different hypersurfaces within the same family of Calabi-Yau 4-orbifolds may result in different Spin(7)-manifolds.
