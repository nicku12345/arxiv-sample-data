The aim of this paper is to present a complete description of all rotational linear Weingarten surface into the Euclidean sphere S3. These surfaces are characterized by a linear relation aH+bK=c, where H and K stand for their mean and Gaussian curvatures, respectively, whereas a; b and c are real constants.
