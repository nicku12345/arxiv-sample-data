This work generalizes a construction by Habermann and Jost of a canonical metric in a Yamabe-positive conformal class, which uses the Green function of the conformal Laplacian. In dimension n=2k+1, 2k+2, or 2k+3, if the k-th GJMS operator P_k admits a Green function, the constant term of its singularity is shown to be a conformal density of weight 2k-n, when restricted to appropriate choices of conformal factor. When it is positive, it is used to build a canonical metric in the conformal class. In the case of the Paneitz-Branson operator P_2, in dimension 5, 6 or 7, we show a positiveness result. In additition, we relate it to an asymptotic invariant of the manifold obtained by stereographic projection via the Green function.
