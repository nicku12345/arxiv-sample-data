Using a deep criteria due to Pigola, Rigoli and Setti, we prove that a geodesically complete, properly immersed submanifold M of a stochastically complete Riemannian manifold N is stochastically complete. This implies that the weak Omori-Yau maximum principle holds on M. As geometric application, we prove sectional curvature estimates for properly immersed cilindrically bounded submanifolds.
