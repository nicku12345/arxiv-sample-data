In \cite{BR1}, \cite{BR2}, a parabolic determinant line bundle on a moduli space of stable parabolic bundles was constructed, along with a Hermitian structure on it. The construction of the Hermitian structure was indirect: The parabolic determinant line bundle was identified with the pullback of the determinant line bundle on a moduli space of usual vector bundles over a covering curve. The Hermitian structure on the parabolic determinant bundle was taken to be the pullback of the Quillen metric on the determinant line bundle on the moduli space of usual vector bundles. Here a direct construction of the Hermitian structure is given. For that we need to establish a version of the correspondence between the stable parabolic bundles and the Hermitian--Einstein connections in the context of conical metrics. Also, a recently obtained parabolic analog of Faltings' criterion of semistability plays a crucial role.
