In this paper, we introduce the notions of logarithmic Poisson structure and logarithmic principal Poisson structure; we prove that the latter induces a representation by logarithmic derivation of the module of logarithmic Kahler differentials; therefore, it induces a differential complex from which we derive the notion of logarithmic Poisson cohomology. We prove that Poisson cohomology and logarithmic Poisson cohomology are equal when the Poisson structure is logsymplectic. We give an example of non logsymplectic but logarithmic Poisson structure for which these cohomologies are equal. We also give an example for which these cohomologies are different. We discuss and modify the K. Saito definition of logarithmic forms. The notes end with an application to a prequantization of the logarithmic Poisson algebra: (C[x; y]; {x; y} = x):
