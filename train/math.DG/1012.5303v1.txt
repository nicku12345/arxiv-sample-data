It has been proved that there are no real hypersurfaces satisfying RA = 0 in non-flat complex space forms. In this paper we prove that the same is true in the case of CR submanifolds of maximal CR dimension, that is there are no CR submanifolds of maximal CR dimension satisfying RA = 0 in non-flat complex space forms.
