Possible irreducible holonomy algebras \g\subset\sp(2m,\Real) of odd Riemannian supermanifolds and irreducible subalgebras \g\subset\gl(n,\Real) with non-trivial first skew-symmetric prolongations are classified. An approach to the classification of some classes of the holonomy algebras of Riemannian supermanifolds is discussed.
