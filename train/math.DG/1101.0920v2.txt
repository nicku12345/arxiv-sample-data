We prove a coisotropic intersection result and deduce the following: 1. Lower bounds on the displacement energy of a subset of a symplectic manifold, in particular a sharp stable energy-Gromov-width inequality. 2. A stable non-squeezing result for neighborhoods of products of unit spheres. 3. Existence of a "badly squeezable" set in \mathbb{R}^{2n} of Hausdorff dimension at most d, for every n\geq2 and d\geq n. 4. Existence of a stably exotic symplectic form on \mathbb{R}^{2n}, for every n\geq2. 5. Non-triviality of a new capacity, which is based on the minimal symplectic area of a regular coisotropic submanifold of dimension d.
