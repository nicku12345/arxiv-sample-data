The category of generalized Lie algebroids is presented. We obtain an exterior differential calculus for generalized Lie algebroids. In particular, we obtain similar results with the classical and modern results for Lie algebroids. So, a new result of Maurer-Cartan type is presented. Supposing that any vector subbundle of the pullback vector bundle of a generalized Lie algebroid is called interior differential system (IDS) for that generalized Lie algebroid, a theorem of Cartan type is obtained. Extending the classical notion of exterior differential system (EDS) to generalized Lie algebroids, a theorem of Cartan type is obtained. Using the theory of linear connections of Ehresmann type presented in the paper [1], the identities of Cartan and Bianchi type are presented.
