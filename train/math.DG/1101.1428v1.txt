This short note aims at (re)proving that the symmetrically normalized graph Laplacian L=\Id - D^{-1/2}WD^{-1/2} (from a graph defined from a Gaussian weighting kernel on a sampled smooth manifold) converges towards the continuous Manifold Laplacian when the sampling become infinitely dense. The convergence rate with respect to the number of samples N is O(1/N).
