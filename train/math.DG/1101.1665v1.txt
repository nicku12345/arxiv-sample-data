The concept of the Ricci soliton was introduced by Hamilton. Ricci soliton is defined by vector field and it's a natural generalization of Einstein metric. We have shown earlier that the vector field of Ricci soliton is an infinitesimal harmonic transformation. In our paper, we survey Ricci solitons geometry as an application of the theory of infinitesimal harmonic transformations.
