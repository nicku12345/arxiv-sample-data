We show that a group of diffeomorphisms \D on the open unit interval I, equipped with the topology of uniform convergence on any compact set of the derivatives at any order, is non regular: the exponential map is not defined for some path of the Lie algebra. this result extends to the group of diffeomorphisms of finite dimensional, non compact manifold M.
