In this paper, we show that, for a biharmonic hypersurface (M,g) of a Riemannian manifold (N,h) of non-positive Ricci curvature, if \int_M|H|^2 v_g<\infty, where H is the mean curvature of (M,g) in (N,h), then (M,g) is minimal in (N,h). Thus, for a counter example (M,g) in the case of hypersurfaces to the generalized Chen's conjecture (cf. Sect.1), it holds that \int_M|H|^2 v_g=\infty.
