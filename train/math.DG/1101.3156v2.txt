In this paper we define and study the slant and semi-slant submanifolds of a Lorentzian almost paracontact manifold. Some necessary and sufficient conditions for a submanifold of a Lorentzian almost paracontact manifold to be slant are obtained. We give some examples for the slant and semi-slant submanifolds of a Lorentzian almost paracontact manifold. We also investigate the integrability conditions for the distributions involved in the definition of a semi-slant submanifold when the ambient manifold is a Lorentzian paracosymplectic and a Lorentzian para-Sasakian manifold, respectively.
