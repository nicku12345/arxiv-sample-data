It is proved the existence of entire solutions of the Laplace's and minimal hypersurface's PDEs on a Hadamard manifold M under certain curvature conditions by investigating the asymptotic Dirichlet's problems for these PDEs. In the harmonic case it is obtained an existence result which assumes the same growth condition on the sectional curvature as of Theorem 1.2 of E. Hsu \cite{Hsu} but that contemplates cases having Ricci curvature with exponential decay. It is also obtained a result which extends and improves Theorem 3.6 of Choi \cite{Choi}. In the minimal case one obtains an extension and an improvement of Theorem 1 of N. do Esp\'{\i}rito-Santo, S. Fornari and J. Ripoll \cite{EFR}, and partial extensions of Theorem 5.2 of J. A. G\'alvez and H. Rosenberg \cite{GR} by allowing the sectional curvature of M degenerate to 0 at infinity.
