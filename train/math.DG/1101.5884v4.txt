B Wilking has recently shown that one can associate a Ricci flow invariant cone of curvature operators C(S), which are nonnegative in a suitable sense, to every Ad_{SO(n,\C)} invariant subset S \subset {\bf so}(n,\C). For curvature operators of a K\"ahler manifold of complex dimension n, one considers Ad_{GL(n,\C)} invariant subsets S \subset {\bf gl}(n,\C). In this article we show:   (i) If S is an Ad_{SO(n,\C)} subset, then C(S) is contained in the cone of curvature operators with nonnegative isotropic curvature and if S is an Ad_{GL(n,\C)} subset, then C(S) is contained in the cone of K\"ahler curvature operators with nonnegative orthogonal bisectional curvature.   (ii) If S \subset {\bf so}(n,\C) is a closed Ad_{SO(n,\C)} invariant subset and C_+(S) \subset C(S) denotes the cone of curvature operators which are {\it positive} in the appropriate sense then one of the two possibilities holds: (a) The connected sum of any two Riemannian manifolds with curvature operators in C_+(S) also admits a metric with curvature operator in C_+(S) (b) The normalized Ricci flow on any compact Riemannian manifold M with curvature operator in C_+(S) converges to either to a metric of constant positive sectional curvature or constant positive holomorphic sectional curvature or M is a rank-1 symmetric space.
