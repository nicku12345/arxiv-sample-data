In this paper we study the non-geodesic non-null biharmonic curves in 3-dimensional hyperbolic Heisenberg group. We prove that all of the non-geodesic non-null biharmonic curves in 3-dimensional hyperbolic Heisenberg group are helices. Moreover, we obtain explicit parametric equations for non-geodesic non-null biharmonic curves and non-geodesic spacelike horizontal biharmonic curves in 3-dimensional hyperbolic Heisenberg group, respectively. We also show that there do not exist non-geodesic timelike horizontal biharmonic curves in 3-dimensional hyperbolic Heisenberg group.
