We introduce the notion of a manifold admitting a simple compact Cartan 3-form \om^3. We study algebraic types of such manifolds specializing on those having skew-symmetric torsion, or those associated with a closed or coclosed 3-form \om^3. We prove the existence of an algebra of multi-symplectic forms \phi^l on these manifolds. Cohomology groups associated with complexes of differential forms on M^n in presence of such a closed multi-symplectic form \phi^l and their relations with the de Rham cohomologies of M are investigated. We show rigidity of a class of strongly associative (resp. strongly coassociative) submanifolds. We include an appendix describing all connected simply connected complete Riemannian manifolds admitting a parallel 3-form.
