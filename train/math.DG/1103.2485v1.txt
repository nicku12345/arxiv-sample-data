We consider conformal immersions of Riemann surfaces in \bb{S}^4 and study their Gauss maps with values in the Grassmann bundle \mathcal{F} = SO_5/T^2 \to \mathbb{S}^4. The energy of maps from Riemann surfaces into \mathcal{F} is considered with respect to the normal metric on the target and immersions with harmonic Gauss maps are characterized. We also show that the normal-harmonic map equation for Gauss maps is a completely integrable system, thus giving a partial answer of a question posed by Y. Ohnita in \cite{ohnita}. Associated \mathbb{S}^1-families of parallel mean curvature immersions in \mathbb{S}^4 are considered. A lower bound of the normal energy of Gauss maps is obtained in terms of the genus of the surface.
