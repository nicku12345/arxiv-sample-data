Germs of Goursat distributions can be classified according to a geometric coding called an RVT code. Jean (1996) and Mormul (2004) have shown that this coding carries precisely the same data as the small growth vector. Montgomery and Zhitomirskii (2010) have shown that such germs correspond to finite jets of Legendrian curve germs, and that the RVT coding corresponds to the classical invariant in the singularity theory of planar curves: the Puiseux characteristic. Here we derive a simple formula for the Puiseux characteristic of the curve corresponding to a Goursat germ with given small growth vector. The simplicity of our theorem (compared with the more complex algorithms previously known) suggests a deeper connection between singularity theory and the theory of nonholonomic distributions.
