An f-structure on a manifold M is an endomorphism field \phi satisfying \phi^3+\phi=0. We call an f-structure {\em regular} if the distribution T=\ker\phi is involutive and regular, in the sense of Palais. We show that when a regular f-structure on a compact manifold M is an almost \S-structure, as defined by Duggal, Ianus, and Pastore, it determines a torus fibration of M over a symplectic manifold. When \rank T = 1, this result reduces to the Boothby-Wang theorem. Unlike similar results due to Blair-Ludden-Yano and Soare, we do not assume that the f-structure is normal. We also show that given an almost \mathcal{S}-structure, we obtain an associated Jacobi structure, as well as a notion of symplectization.
