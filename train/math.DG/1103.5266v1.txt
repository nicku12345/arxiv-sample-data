Tanno [6] provided an algebraic characterization in an almost Hermitian manifold to reduce to a space of constant holomorphic sectional curvature, which he later extended for the Sasakian manifolds as well. In this present paper, we generalize the same characterization in generalized g.f.f-manifolds.
