We prove that the flat product metric on D^n\times S^1 is scattering rigid where D^n is the unit ball in \R^n and n\geq 2. The scattering data (loosely speaking) of a Riemannian manifold with boundary is map S:U^+\partial M\to U^-\partial M from unit vectors V at the boundary that point inward to unit vectors at the boundary that point outwards. The map (where defined) takes V to \gamma'_V(T_0) where \gamma_V is the unit speed geodesic determined by V and T_0 is the first positive value of t (when it exists) such that \gamma_V(t) again lies in the boundary. We show that any other Riemannian manifold (M,\partial M,g) with boundary \partial M isometric to \partial(D^n\times S^1) and with the same scattering data must be isometric to D^n\times S^1. This is the first scattering rigidity result for a manifold that has a trapped geodesic. The main issue is to show that the unit vectors tangent to trapped geodesics in (M,\partial M,g) have measure 0 in the unit tangent bundle.
