Given a warped product of the real line with a Riemannian manifold of arbitrary dimension, we classify the hypersurfaces whose tangent spaces make a constant angle with the vector field tangent to the real direction. We show that this is a natural setting in which to extend previous results in this direction made by several authors. Moreover, when the constant angle hypersurface is a graph over the Riemannian manifold, we show that the function involved satisfies a generalized eikonal equation, which we solve via a geometric method. In the final part of this paper we prove that minimal constant angle hypersurfaces are cylinders over minimal submanifolds.
