Let G be a connected complex Lie group and \Gamma\subset G a cocompact lattice. Let H be a complex Lie group. We prove that a holomorphic principal H-bundle E_H over G/\Gamma admits a holomorphic connection if and only if E_H is invariant. If G is simply connected, we show that a holomorphic principal H-bundle E_H over G/\Gamma admits a flat holomorphic connection if and only if E_H is homogeneous.
