We construct non-zero constant mean curvature H surfaces in the product spaces \mathbb{S}^2 \times \mathbb{R} and \mathbb{H}^2\times \mathbb{R} by using suitable conjugate Plateau constructions. The resulting surfaces are complete, have bounded height and are invariant under a discrete group of horizontal translations. In \mathbb{S}^2\times\mathbb{R} (for any H > 0) or \mathbb{H}^2\times\mathbb{R} (for H > 1/2), a 1-parameter family of unduloid-type surfaces is obtained, some of which are shown to be compact in \mathbb{S}^2\times\mathbb{R}. Finally, in the case of H = 1/2 in \mathbb{H}^2 \times \mathbb{R}, the constructed examples have the symmetries of a tessellation of \mathbb{H}^2 by regular polygons.
