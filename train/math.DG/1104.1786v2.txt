Let M be a closed Riemann surface, N a Riemannian manifold of Hermitian non-positive curvature, f:M\to N a continuous map, and E the function on the Teichm\"uller space of M that assigns to a complex structure on M the energy of the harmonic map homotopic to f. We show that E is a plurisubharmonic function on the Teichm\"uller space of M. If N has strictly negative Hermitian curvature, we characterize the directions in which the complex Hessian of E vanishes.
