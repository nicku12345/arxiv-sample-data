Let \mathcal H_c(M) stand for the path connected identity component of the group of all compactly supported homeomorphisms of a manifold M. It is shown that \mathcal H_c(M) is perfect and simple under mild assumptions on M. Next, conjugation-invariant norms on \H_c(M) are considered and the boundedness of \mathcal H_c(M) is investigated. Finally, the structure of the universal covering group of \mathcal H_c(M) is studied.
