The goal of this paper is to clarify connections between Killing fields of constant length on a Rimannian geodesic orbit manifold (M,g) and the structure of its full isometry group. The Lie algebra of the full isometry group of (M,g) is identified with the Lie algebra of Killing fields \mathfrak{g} on (M,g). We prove the following result: If \mathfrak{a} is an abelian ideal of \mathfrak{g}, then every Killing field X\in \mathfrak{a} has constant length. On the ground of this assertion we give a new proof of one result of C. Gordon: Every Riemannian geodesic orbit manifold of nonpositive Ricci curvature is a symmetric space.
