In this note, we obtain the asymptotic estimate for the time derivative of the \Phi-entropy in terms of the lower bound on the Bakry-Emery \Gamma_2 curvature. In the cases of Hyperbolic space and Heisenberg group, we show that the time derivative of the \Phi-entropy is non-increasing, and we also get sharp asymptotic bound for the time derivative of the entropy in the Heisenberg group.
