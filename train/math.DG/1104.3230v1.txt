In this paper we define a new type of 2-degenerate Cartan curves in Minkowski spacetime R_{1}^{4}. We prove that this type of curves contain only the polynomial functions as its components whose third derivative vanish completely. No curve with acceleration zero in R_{1}^{4} is a 2-degenerate Cartan curve, therefore we show that the type of curves that we search for must contain polynomials of degree two among its components.
