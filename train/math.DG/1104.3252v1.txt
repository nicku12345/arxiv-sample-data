In this paper we show how the existence of a certain stable cylinder determines (locally) the ambient manifold where it is immersed. This cylinder has to verify a {\it bifurcation phenomena}, we make this explicit in the introduction. In particular, the existence of such a stable cylinder implies that the ambient manifold has infinite volume.
