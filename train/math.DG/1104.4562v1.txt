This note is concerned with some essential properties (optimal isoperimetry, first variation, and monotonicity formula) of the so-called [0,1)\ni\gamma-torsional rigidity \mathcal{T}_{\gamma,\mathsf{g}} on a complete Riemannian two-manifold (\mathbb M^2,\mathsf{g}). Even in the special case of \mathbb R^2, major results are new.
