For a bounded domain \Omega with a piecewise smooth boundary in a complete Riemannian manifold M, we study eigenvalues of the Dirichlet eigenvalue problem of the Laplacian. By making use of a fact that eigenfunctions form an orthonormal basis of L^2(\Omega) in place of the Rayleigh-Ritz formula, we obtain inequalities for eigenvalues of the Laplacian. In particular, for lower order eigenvalues, our results extend the results of Chen and Cheng \cite{CC}.
