We provide examples of naturally reductive pseudo-Riemannian spaces, in particular an example of a naturally reductive pseudo-Riemannian 2-step nilpotent Lie group (N, < \,,\,>_N), such that < \,,\,>_N is invariant under a left action and for which the center is degenerate. The metric does not correspond to a bi-invariant one.
