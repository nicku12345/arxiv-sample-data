For a Riemannian manifold M, we determine some curvature properties of a tangent bundle equipped with the rescaled metric.The main aim of this paper is to give explicit formulae for the rescaled metric on TM, and investigate the geodesics on the tangent bundle with respect to the rescaled Sasaki metric.
