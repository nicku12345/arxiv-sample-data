We classify all the surfaces in M^2(c_1)\times M^2(c_2) for which the tangent space T_pM^2 makes constant angles with T_p(M^2(c_1)\times \{p_2\}) (or equivalently with T_p(\{p_1\}\times M^2(c_2)) for every point p=(p_1,p_2) of M^2. Here M^2(c_1) and M^2(c_2) are 2-dimensional space forms, not both flat. As a corollary we give a classification of all the totally geodesic surfaces in M^2(c_1)\times M^2(c_2).
