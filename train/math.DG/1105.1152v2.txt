In this paper, we prove that complete gradient steady K\"ahler-Ricci solitons with harmonic Bochner tensor are necessarily K\"ahler-Ricci flat, i.e., Calabi-Yau, and that complete gradient shrinking (or expanding) K\"ahler-Ricci solitons with harmonic Bochner tensor must be isometric to a quotient of N^k\times \mathbb{C}^{n-k}, where N is a K\"ahler-Einstein manifold with positive (or negative) scalar curvature.
