In this paper we obtain density estimates for compact surfaces immersed in R^n with total boundary curvature less than 4pi and with sufficiently small L^p norm of the mean curvature, p>2. Our results generalize the main results in [2]. We then apply our estimates to discuss the geometry and topology of such surfaces.
