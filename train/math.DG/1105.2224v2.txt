In this short note we establish an integral geometric inequality in a smooth metric measure space of the nonnegative Bakry-\'Emery Ricci curvature. This result can be regarded as a mild generalization of the almost Schur theorem due to De Lellis and Topping (Calc. Var., DOI: 10.1007/s00526-011-0413-z).
