We show that the de Rham theorem, interpreted as the isomorphism between distributional de Rham cohomology and simplicial homology in the dual dimension for a simplicial decomposition of a compact oriented manifold, is a straightforward consequence of elementary properties of currents. The explicit construction of this isomorphism extends to other cases, such as relative and absolute cohomology spaces of manifolds with corners.
