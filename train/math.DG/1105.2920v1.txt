Let M be an n(\geq3)-dimensional oriented compact submanifold with parallel mean curvature in the simply connected space form F^{n+p}(c) with c+H^2>0, where H is the mean curvature of M. We prove that if the Ricci curvature of M satisfies Ric_{M}\geq(n-2)(c+H^2), then M is either a totally umbilic sphere, the Clifford hypersurface S^{m}\big(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2(c+H^2)}}\big)\times S^{m}\big(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2(c+H^2)}}\big) in S^{n+1}(\frac{1}{\sqrt{c+H^2}}) with n=2m, or \mathbb{C}P^{2}(4/3(c+H^2)) in S^7(\frac{1}{\sqrt{c+H^2}}). In particular, if Ric_{M}>(n-2)(c+H^2), then M is a totally umbilic sphere.
