The main point of this paper is that, under suitable conditions on the mean curvature and the Ricci curvature of the ambient space, we can extend Choi-Schoen's Compactness Theorem to compact embedded minimal surfaces to simple immersed compact H-surfaces in a Riemannian manifold with positive Ricci curvature (the mean curvature small depending on the Ricci curvature). Also, we prove that the space of convex embedded (fixed) constant mean curvature hypersurfaces in a simply connected 1/4-pinched manifold is compact.
