We study the limits of holonomy representations of complex projective structures on a compact Riemann surface in the Morgan-Shalen compactification of the character variety. We show that the dual R-trees of the quadratic differentials associated to a divergent sequence of projective structures determine the Morgan-Shalen limit points up to a natural folding operation. For quadratic differentials with simple zeros, no folding is possible and the limit of holonomy representations is isometric to the dual tree. We also derive an estimate for the growth rate of the holonomy map in terms of a norm on the space of quadratic differentials.
