To study spacelike surfaces in the Lorentz-Minkowski space \Bbb R^{4}_1, we construct a pair of maps whose values are in the lightcone, called \mathfrak l_r^{\pm} -Gauss maps. We can use these maps to study umbilical spacelike surfaces and find parametrizations of spacelike surfaces of revolution of hyperbolic and eliptic types in some particular cases.
