We prove in this paper that, under suitable coinditions on an initial data set, we can obtain Area and Curvature Estimates for simple marginally outer trapped surfaces (or MOTS). Using this estimates, we derive a Compactness Theorem for MOTS. Moreover, the Compactness Theorem will allow us to adapt the recent Degree Theory of H. Rosenberg and G. Smith for proving existence results for embedded MOTS in suitable compact initial data sets
