We examine functorial and homotopy properties of the exotic characteristic homomorphism in the category of Lie algebroids which was lastly obtained by the authors in [4]. This homomorphism depends on a triple (A,B,\nabla) where B \subset A are regular Lie algebroids, both over the same regular foliated manifold (M,F), and \nabla is a flat L-connection in A, where L is an arbitrary Lie algebroid over M. The Rigidity Theorem (i.e. the independence from the choice of homotopic Lie subalgebroids of B) is obtained. The exotic characteristic homomorphism is factorized by one (called universal) obtained for a pair of regular Lie algebroids. We raise the issue of injectivity of the universal homomorphism and establish injectivity for special cases. Here the Koszul homomorphism for pairs of isotropy Lie algebras plays a major role.
