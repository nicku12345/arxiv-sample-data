Consider a Riemannian symmetric space X= G/K of non-compact type, where G denotes a connected, real, semi-simple Lie group with finite center, and K a maximal compact subgroup of G. Let \widetilde X be its Oshima compactification, and (\pi,\mathrm{C}(\widetilde X)) the regular representation of G on \widetilde X. In this paper, a regularized trace for the convolution operators \pi(f) is defined, yielding a distribution on G which can be interpreted as global character of \pi. In case that f has compact support in a certain set of transversal elements, this distribution is a locally integrable function, and given by a fixed point formula analogous to the formula for the global character of an induced representation of G.
