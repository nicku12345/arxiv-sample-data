We prove that for any open orientable surface S of finite topology, there exist a Riemann surface \mathcal{M}, a relatively compact domain M\subset\mathcal{M} and a continuous map X:\bar{M}\to\mathbb{C}^3 such that: \mathcal{M} and M are homeomorphic to S, \mathcal{M}-M and \mathcal{M}-\bar{M} contain no relatively compact components in \mathcal{M}, X|_M is a complete null holomorphic curve, X|_{\bar{M}-M}:\bar{M}-M\to\mathbb{C}^3 is an embedding and the Hausdorff dimension of X(\bar{M}-M) is 1.   Moreover, for any \epsilon>0 and compact null holomorphic curve Y:N\to\mathbb{C}^3 with non-empty boundary Y(\partial N), there exist Riemann surfaces M and \mathcal{M} homeomorphic to N^\circ and a map X:\bar{M}\to\mathbb{C}^3 in the above conditions such that \delta^H(Y(\partial N),X(\bar{M}-M))<\epsilon, where \delta^H(\cdot,\cdot) means Hausdorff distance in \mathbb{C}^3.
