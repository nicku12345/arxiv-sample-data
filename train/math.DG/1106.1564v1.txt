In this paper we provide a review of asymptotic results of Toeplitz operators and their applications in TQFT. To do this we review the differential geometric construction of the Hitchin connection on a prequantizable compact symplectic manifold. We use asymptotic results relating the Hitchin connec- tion and Toeplitz operators, to, in the special case of the moduli space of flat SU(n)-connections on a surface, prove asymptotic faithfulness of the SU(n) quantum representations of the mapping class group. We then go on to re- view formal Hitchin connections and formal trivializations of these. We discuss how these fit together to produce a Berezin-Toeplitz star product, which is independent of the complex structure. Finally we give explicit examples of all the above objects in the case of the abelian moduli space. We furthermore discuss an approach to curve operators in the TQFT associated to abelian Chern-Simons theory.
