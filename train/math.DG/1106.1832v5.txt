We show that given a harmonic map \varphi from a Riemann surface to a classical compact simply connected inner symmetric space, there is a J_2-holomorphic twistor lift of \varphi (or its negative) if and only if it is nilconformal. In the case of harmonic maps of finite uniton number, we give algebraic formulae in terms of holomorphic data which describes their extended solutions. In particular, this gives explicit formulae for the twistor lifts of all harmonic maps of finite uniton number from a surface to the above symmetric spaces.
