In this paper, we study n-dimensional hypersurfaces with constant m^{\text{th}} mean curvature H_m in a unit sphere S^{n+1}(1) and prove that if the m^{\text{th}} mean curvature H_m takes value between   \dfrac{1}{(\tan \frac{\pi}{k})^m} and \frac{k^2-2}{n}(\frac{k^2+m-2}{n-m})^{\frac{m-2}{2}} for 1\leq m\leq n-1 and any integer k\geq 2, then there exists at least one n-dimensional compact nontrivial embedded hypersurface with constant H_m>0 in S^{n+1}(1). When m=1, our results reduce to the results of Perdomo \cite{[P]}; when m=2 and m=4, our results reduce to the results of Cheng-Li-Wei \cite{[WCL]}.
