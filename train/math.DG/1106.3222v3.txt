We consider a complete biharmonic immersed submanifold M in an Euclidean space \mathbb{E}^N. Assume that the immersion is proper, that is, the preimage of every compact set in \mathbb{E}^N is also compact in M. Then, we prove that M is minimal. It is considered as an affirmative answer to the global version of Chen's conjecture for biharmonic submanifolds.
