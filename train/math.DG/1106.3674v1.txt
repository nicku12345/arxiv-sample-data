In this paper, we initiate the study of \p R-warped products in para-K\"ahler manifolds and prove some fundamental results on such submanifolds. In particular, we establish a general optimal inequality for \p R-warped products in para-K\"ahler manifolds involving only the warping function and the second fundamental form. Moreover, we completely classify \p R-warped products in the flat para-K\"ahler manifold with least codimension which satisfy the equality case of the inequality.
