In this paper we develope a theory of reduction for classical systems with Poisson Lie groups symmetries using the notion of momentum map introduced by Lu. The local description of Poisson manifolds and Poisson Lie groups and the properties of Lu's momentum map allow us to define a Poisson reduced space.
