We develop a notion of Einstein manifolds with skew torsion on compact, orientable Riemannian manifolds of dimension four. We prove an analogue of the Hitchin-Thorpe inequality and study the case of equality. We use the link with self-duality to study the moduli space of 1-instantons on the 4-sphere for a family of metrics defined by Bonneau.
