We give the first rigorous construction of complete, embedded self-shrinking hypersurfaces under mean curvature flow, since Angenent's torus in 1989. The surfaces exist for any sufficiently large prescribed genus g, and are non-compact with one end. Each has 4g+4 symmetries and comes from desingularizing the intersection of the plane and sphere through a great circle, a configuration with very high symmetry. Each is at infinity asymptotic to the cone in \mathbb{R}^3 over a 2\pi/(g+1)-periodic graph on an equator of the unit sphere \mathbb{S}^2\subseteq\mathbb{R}^3, with the shape of a periodically "wobbling sheet". This is a dramatic instability phenomenon, with changes of asymptotics that break much more symmetry than seen in minimal surface constructions. The core of the proof is a detailed understanding of the linearized problem in a setting with severely unbounded geometry, leading to special PDEs of Ornstein-Uhlenbeck type with fast growth on coefficients of the gradient terms. This involves identifying new, adequate weighted H\"older spaces of asymptotically conical functions in which the operators invert, via a Liouville-type result with precise asymptotics.
