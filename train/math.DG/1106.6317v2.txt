A condition of Osserman type, called \phi-null Osserman condition, is introduced and studied in the context of Lorentz globally framed f-manifolds. An explicit example shows the naturalness of this condition in the setting of Lorentz \mathcal{S}-manifolds. We prove that a Lorentz \mathcal{S}-manifold with constant \phi-sectional curvature is \phi-null Osserman, extending a result stated for Lorentz Sasaki space forms. Then we state some characterizations for a particular class of \phi-null Osserman \cal{S}-manifolds. Finally, some examples are examined.
