The notion of Anosov representations has been introduced by Labourie in his study of the Hitchin component for SL(n,R). Subsequently, Anosov representations have been studied mainly for surface groups, in particular in the context of higher Teichmueller spaces, and for lattices in SO(1,n). In this article we extend the notion of Anosov representations to representations of arbitrary word hyperbolic groups and start the systematic study of their geometric properties. In particular, given an Anosov representation of \Gamma into G we explicitly construct open subsets of compact G-spaces, on which \Gamma acts properly discontinuously and with compact quotient.   As a consequence we show that higher Teichmueller spaces parametrize locally homogeneous geometric structures on compact manifolds. We also obtain applications regarding (non-standard) compact Clifford-Klein forms and compactifications of locally symmetric spaces of infinite volume.
