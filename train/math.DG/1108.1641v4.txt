In hyperbolic 3-space \mathbb{H}^3 surfaces of constant mean curvature H come in three types, corresponding to the cases 0 \leq H < 1, H = 1, H > 1. Via the Lawson correspondence the latter two cases correspond to constant mean curvature surfaces in Euclidean 3-space \mathbb{E}^3 with H=0 and H \neq 0, respectively. These surface classes have been investigated intensively in the literature. For the case 0 \leq H < 1 there is no Lawson correspondence in Euclidean space and there are relatively few publications. Examples have been difficult to construct. In this paper we present a generalized Weierstra{\ss} type representation for surfaces of constant mean curvature in \mathbb{H}^3 with particular emphasis on the case of mean curvature 0\leq H < 1. In particular, the generalized Weierstra{\ss} type representation presented in this paper enables us to construct simultaneously minimal surfaces (H=0) and non-minimal constant mean curvature surfaces (0<H<1).
