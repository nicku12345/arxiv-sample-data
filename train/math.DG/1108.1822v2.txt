In this paper we consider on a complete Riemannian manifold M an immersed totally geodesic hypersurface \Si existing together with an immersed submanifold N without focal points. No curvature condition is needed. We obtained several connectedness results relating the topologies of M and \Si which depend on the codimension of N.
