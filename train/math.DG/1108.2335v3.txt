Let Y be a hyperbolic surface and let \phi be a Laplacian eigenfunction having eigenvalue -1/4-\tau^2 with \tau>0. Let N(\phi) be the set of nodal lines of \phi. For a fixed analytic curve \gamma of finite length, we study the number of intersections between N(\phi) and \gamma in terms of \tau. When Y is compact and \gamma a geodesic circle, or when Y has finite volume and \gamma is a closed horocycle, we prove that \gamma is "good" in the sense of [TZ]. As a result, we obtain that the number of intersections between N(\phi) and \gamma is O(\tau). This bound is sharp.
