We introduce the notion of CR quaternionic map and we prove that any such real-analytic map, between CR quaternionic manifolds, is the restriction of a quaternionic map between quaternionic manifolds. As an application, we prove, for example, that for any submanifold M, of dimension 4k-1, of a quaternionic manifold N, such that TM generates a quaternionic subbundle of TN|_M, of (real) rank 4k, there exists, locally, a quaternionic submanifold of N, containing M as a hypersurface.
