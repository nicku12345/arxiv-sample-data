Let x be an m-dimensional umbilic-free hypersurface in an (m+1)-dimensional unit sphere \mathbb{S}^{m+1}(m\geq3). One of important questions is to classify hypersurfaces with two distinct principal curvatures. In this paper, we classify and explicitly express the hypersurfaces with two distinct principal curvatures and closed Moebius form, and then we characterize and classify conformally flat hypersurfaces of dimension larger than 3.
