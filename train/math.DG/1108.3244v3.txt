Consider a limit space (M_\alpha,g_\alpha,p_\alpha)\stackrel{GH}{\rightarrow} (Y,d_Y,p), where the M_\alpha^n have a lower Ricci curvature bound and are volume noncollapsed. The tangent cones of Y at a point p\in Y are known to be metric cones C(X), however they need not be unique. Let \bar\Omega_{Y,p}\subseteq\cM_{GH} be the closed subset of compact metric spaces X which arise as cross sections for the tangents cones of Y at p. In this paper we study the properties of \bar\Omega_{Y,p}. In particular, we give necessary and sufficient conditions for an open smooth family \Omega\equiv (X_s,g_s) of closed manifolds to satisfy \bar\Omega =\bar\Omega_{Y,p} for {\it some} limit Y and point p\in Y as above, where \bar\Omega is the closure of \Omega in the set of metric spaces equipped with the Gromov-Hausdorff topology. We use this characterization to construct examples which exhibit fundamentally new behaviors. The first application is to construct limit spaces (Y^n,d_Y,p) with n\geq 3 such that at p there exists for every 0\leq k\leq n-2 a tangent cone at p of the form \RR^{k}\times C(X^{n-k-1}), where X^{n-k-1} is a smooth manifold not isometric to the standard sphere. In particular, this is the first example which shows that a stratification of a limit space Y based on the Euclidean behavior of tangent cones is not possible or even well defined. It is also the first example of a three dimensional limit space with nonunique tangent cones. The second application is to construct a limit space (Y^5,d_Y,p), such that at p the tangent cones are not only not unique, but not homeomorphic. Specifically, some tangent cones are homeomorphic to cones over \CC P^2\sharp\bar{\CC P}^2 while others are homeomorphic to cones over \Sn^4.
