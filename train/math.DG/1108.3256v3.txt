We show that polar actions of cohomogeneity two on simple compact Lie groups of higher rank, endowed with a biinvariant Riemannian metric, are hyperpolar. Combining this with a recent result of the second-named author, we are able to prove that polar actions induced by reductive algebraic subgroups in the isometry group of an irreducible Riemannian symmetric space of higher rank are hyperpolar. In particular, this result affirmatively settles the conjecture that polar actions on irreducible compact symmetric spaces of higher rank are hyperpolar.
