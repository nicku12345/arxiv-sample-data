In this paper, in Euclidean n -space, we investigate the relation between slant helices and spherical helices. Moreover, in E n, we show that a slant helix and the tangent indicatrix of the slant helix have the same axis (or direction). Also, we give the important relations between slant helices, spherical helices in E n and geodesic curves on a helix hypersurface in E n.
