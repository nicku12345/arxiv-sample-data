On Kahler manifolds with Ricci curvature bounded from below, we establish some theorems which are counterparts of some classical theorems in Riemannian geometry, for example, Bishop-Gromov's relative volume comparison, Bonnet-Meyers theorem, and Yau's gradient estimate for positive harmonic functions. The tool is a Bochner type formula reflecting the Kahler structure.
