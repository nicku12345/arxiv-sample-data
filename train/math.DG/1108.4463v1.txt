We give a local analytic characterization that a minimal surface in the 3-sphere \, \ES^3 \subset \R^4 defined by an irreducible cubic polynomial is one of the Lawson's minimal tori. This provides an alternative proof of the result by Perdomo (\emph{Characterization of order 3 algebraic immersed minimal surfaces of S^3},Geom. Dedicata 129 (2007), 23--34).
