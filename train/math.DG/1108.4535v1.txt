In this paper, we study Bertrand surface offsets by considering the dual geodesic trihedron(dual Darboux frame) of the ruled surfaces. We obtain the relationships between the invariants of Bertrand trajectory ruled surfaces. Furthermore, we obtain the conditions for these surface offset to be developable.
