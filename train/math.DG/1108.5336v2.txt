A local classification of the Hermitian manifolds with flat associated connection is given. Hermitian manifolds admitting locally a conformal metric with flat associated connection are characterized by a curvature identity. Locally conformal Kaehler manifolds as well as Hermitian surfaces with vanishing associated conformal curvature tensor are characterized as locally conformal to a Kaehler manifold of constant holomorphic sectional curvatures.
