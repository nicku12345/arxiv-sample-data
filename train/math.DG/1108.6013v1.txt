We show how the double vector bundle structure of the manifold of double velocities, with its submanifolds of holonomic and semiholonomic double velocities, is mirrored by a structure of holonomic and semiholonomic subgroups in the principal prolongation of the first jet group. We use the actions of these groups to construct holonomic and semiholonomic submanifolds in the manifold of double contact elements, and show that these give rise to affine bundles where a semiholonomic element has well-defined holonomic and curvature components.
