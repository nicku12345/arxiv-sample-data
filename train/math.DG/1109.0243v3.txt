In this paper we prove that any complete conformal gradient soliton with nonnegative Ricci tensor is either isometric to a direct product \mathbb{R}\times N^{n-1}, or globally conformally equivalent to the Euclidean space \mathbb{R}^{n} or to the round sphere \mathbb{S}^{n}. In particular, we show that any complete, noncompact, gradient Yamabe-type soliton with positive Ricci tensor is rotationally symmetric, whenever the potential function is nonconstant.
