We derive lower bounds on the scalar curvature of complete non-compact gradient Yamabe solitons under some integral curvature conditions. Based on this, we prove that the corresponding potential functions have at most quadratic growth in distance. We also obtain a finite topological type property on complete shrinking gradient Yamabe solitons under suitable scalar curvature assumptions.
