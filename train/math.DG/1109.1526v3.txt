The fourth paper of our series of papers entitled "Differential Geometry of Microlinear Frolicher Spaces is concerned with jet bundles. We present three distinct approaches together with transmogrifications of the first into the second and of the second to the third. The affine bundle theorem and the equivalence of the three approaches with coordinates are relegated to a subsequent paper.
