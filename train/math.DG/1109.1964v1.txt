We consider normal almost contact structures on a Riemannian manifold and, through their associated sections of an ad-hoc twistor bundle, study their harmonicity, as sections or as maps. We rewrite these harmonicity equations in terms of the Riemann curvature tensor and find conditions relating the harmonicity of the almost contact and almost complex structures of the total and base spaces of the Morimoto fibration.
