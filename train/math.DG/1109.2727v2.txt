The projective algebra p(M;F) (i.e the collection of all projective vector fields)of a Finsler space (M;F) is a finite-dimensional Lie algebra with respect to the usual Lie bracket. The projective algebra of Einstein metrics has been perpetually studied from physical and geometrical approaches. Here, the projective algebra of Einstein Matsumoto space of dimension n \geq 3 is characterized. Moreover, Einstein Matsumoto metrics with maximum projective symmetry are studied and characterized.
