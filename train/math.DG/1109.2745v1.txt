Almost contact structures can be identified with sections of a twistor bundle and this allows to define their harmonicity, as sections or maps. We consider the class of nearly cosymplectic almost contact structures on a Riemannian manifold and prove curvature identities which imply the harmonicity of their parametrizing section, thus complementing earlier results on nearly-K{\"a}hler almost complex structures.
