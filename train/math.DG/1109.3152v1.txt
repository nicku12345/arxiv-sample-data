Two new classes of metrizable vector bundles have been presented in the papers [1] and [4]. The Lie algebroid generalized tangent bundle of a dual vector bundle is presented. This Lie algebroid is a new example of metrizable vector bundle. A new class of Hamilton spaces, called by use, generalized Hamilton (\rho,\eta)-space, Hamilton (\rho,\eta)-space and Cartan (\rho,\eta)-space are presented. The results obtained in the particular case of Lie algebroids emphasize the importance and the utility of our new method by work. In particular, if all morphisms are identities morphisms, then the classical results are obtained.
