We give explicit formulas for all odd order differential intertwinors on the subbundle of the bundle of spinor-k-forms that are annihilated by the Clifford multiplication over the odd dimensional standard sphere. The Dirac and Rarita-Schwinger operators appear in the case of k=0 and k=1, respectively.
