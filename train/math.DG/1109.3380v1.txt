Based on ideas of Pigolla and Setti \cite{PS} we prove that immersed submanifolds with bounded mean curvature of Cartan-Hadamard manifolds are Feller. We also consider Riemannian submersions \pi \colon M \to N with compact minimal fibers, and based on various criteria for parabolicity and stochastic completeness, see \cite{Grygor'yan}, we prove that M is Feller, parabolic or stochastically complete if and only if the base N is Feller, parabolic or stochastically complete respectively.
