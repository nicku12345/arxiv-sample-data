We determine the space of algebraic pseudo-Hermitian K\"ahler-Weyl curvature tensors and the space of para-Hermitian K\"ahler-Weyl curvature tensors in dimension 4 and show that every algebraic possibility is geometrically realizable. We establish the Gray identity for pseudo-Hermitian Weyl manifolds and for para-Hermitian Weyl manifolds in arbitrary dimension.
