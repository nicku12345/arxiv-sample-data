For an Alexandrov space (with curvature bounded below), we determine the maximal dimension of its isometry group and show that the space is isometric to a Riemannian manifold, provided the dimension of its isometry group is maximal. We also determine a gap in the possible dimensions of the isometry groups and show that if the Alexandrov space is symmetric, then it is isometric to a Riemannian manifold.
