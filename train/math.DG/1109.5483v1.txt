We propose a weak formulation for the binormal curvature flow of curves in \R^3. This formulation is sufficiently broad to consider integral currents as initial data, and sufficiently strong for the weak-strong uniqueness property to hold, as long as self-intersections do not occur. We also prove a global existence theorem in that framework.
