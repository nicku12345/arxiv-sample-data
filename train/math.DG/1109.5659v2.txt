In this work, we study graphs in \M^n\times\Real that are evolving by the mean curvature flow over a bounded domain on \M^n, with prescribed contact angle in the boundary. We prove that solutions converge to translating surfaces in \M^n\times\Real. Also, for a Riemannian manifold \M^2 with negative Gaussian curvature at each point, we show non-existence of complete vertically translating graphs in \M^2\times\Real.
