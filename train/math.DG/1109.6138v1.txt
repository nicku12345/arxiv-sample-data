We find a Simons type formula for submanifolds with parallel mean curvature vector (pmc submanifolds) in product spaces M^n(c)\times\mathbb{R}, where M^n(c) is a space form with constant sectional curvature c, and then we use it to prove a gap theorem for the mean curvature of certain complete proper-biharmonic pmc submanifolds, and classify proper-biharmonic pmc surfaces in \mathbb{S}^n(c)\times\mathbb{R}.
