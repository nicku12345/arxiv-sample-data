We identify a region \Bbb{W}_{\f{1}{3}} in a Grassmann manifold \grs{n}{m}, not covered by a usual matrix coordinate chart, with the following important property. For a complete n-submanifold in \ir{n+m} \, (n\ge 3, m\ge2) with parallel mean curvature whose image under the Gauss map is contained in a compact subset K\subset\Bbb{W}_{\f{1}{3}}\subset\grs{n}{m}, we can construct strongly subharmonic functions and derive a priori estimates for the harmonic Gauss map. While we do not know yet how close our region is to being optimal in this respect, it is substantially larger than what could be achieved previously with other methods. Consequently, this enables us to obtain substantially stronger Bernstein type theorems in higher codimension than previously known.
