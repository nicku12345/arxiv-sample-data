In this work, we study metrics which are both homogeneous and Ricci soliton. If there exists a transitive solvable group of isometries on a Ricci soliton, we show that it is isometric to a solvsoliton. Moreover, unless the manifold is flat, it is necessarily simply-connected and diffeomorphic to \mathbb R^n.   In the general case, we prove that homogeneous Ricci solitons must be semi-algebraic Ricci solitons in the sense that they evolve under the Ricci flow by dilation and pullback by automorphisms of the isometry group. In the special case that there exists a transitive semi-simple group of isometries on a Ricci soliton, we show that such a space is in fact Einstein. In the compact case, we produce new proof that Ricci solitons are necessarily Einstein.   Lastly, we characterize solvable Lie groups which admit Ricci soliton metrics.
