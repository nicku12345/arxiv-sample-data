In this article we introduce a method to construct \rm{G}_2-instantons on \rm{G}_2-manifolds arising from Joyce's generalised Kummer construction. The method is based on gluing ASD instantons over ALE spaces to flat bundles on \rm{G}_2-orbifolds of the form T^7/ \Gamma. We use this construction to produce non-trivial examples of \rm{G}_2-instantons.
