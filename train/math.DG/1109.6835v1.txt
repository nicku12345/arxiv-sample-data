Motivated by the theory of isoparametric hypersurfaces, we study submanifolds whose tubular hypersurfaces have some constant "higher order mean curvatures". Here a k-th order mean curvature Q_k (k\geq1) of a hypersurface M^n is defined as the k-th power sum of the principal curvatures, or equivalently, of the shape operator. Many necessary restrictions involving principal curvatures, higher order mean curvatures and Jacobi operators on such submanifolds are obtained, which, among other things, generalize some classical results in the theory of isoparametric hypersurfaces given by E. Cartan, K. Nomizu, H. F. M{\"u}nzner, Q. M. Wang, \emph{etc.}. As an application, we finally get a geometrical filtration for the focal varieties of isoparametric functions on a complete Riemannian manifold.
