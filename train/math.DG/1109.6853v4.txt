In this paper, we will first derive a DDVV-type optimal inequality for real skew-symmetric matrices, then we apply it to establish a Simons-type integral inequality for Riemannian submersions with totally geodesic fibres and Yang-Mills horizontal distributions. In this way, we show phenomenons of duality between Submanifold geometry and Riemannnian submersion, particularly between second fundamental form of a submanifold and integrability tensor of a Riemannian submersion.
