Special curves and their characterizations are one of the main area of mathematicians and physicians.   As a special curve we will mainly focus on Mannheim curve which has the following relation: k1={\beta}(k1^2+k2^) where k1 and k2 are curvature and torsion, respectively.   In the present paper we define Mannheim curves for 4-dimensional Galilean space and investigate some characterization of it.
