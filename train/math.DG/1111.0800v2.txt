We extend to the context of Courant algebroids several hierarchies that can be constructed on Poisson-Nijenhuis manifolds. More precisely, we introduce several notions (Poisson-Nijenhuis, deformation-Nijenhuis and Nijenhuis pairs) that extend to Courant algebroids the notion of a Poisson-Nijenhuis manifold, by using the idea that both the Poisson and the Nijenhuis structures, although they seem to be different in nature when considered on manifolds, are just (1,1)-tensors on the usual Courant algebroid TM \oplus T^*M  satisfying several constraints. For each of the generalizations mentioned, we show that there are natural hierarchies obtained by successive deformation by one of the (1,1)-tensor.
