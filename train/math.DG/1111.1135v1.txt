The first aim of this paper is to define the dual timelike - spacelike Mannheim partner curves in Dual Lorentzian Space ID3 1, the second aim of this paper is to obtain the relationships between the curvatures and the torsions of the dual timelike - spacelike Mannheim partner curves with respect to each other and the final aim of this paper is to get the necessary and sufficient conditions for the dual timelike -spacelike Mannheim partner curves in ID3 1 .
