We prove several Liouville theorems for F-harmonic maps from some complete Riemannian manifolds by assuming some conditions on the Hessian of the distance function, the degrees of F(t) and the asymptotic behavior of the map at infinity. In particular, the results can be applied to F-harmonic maps from some pinched manifolds, and can deduce a Bernstein type result for an entire minimal graph.
