Let F^{n+p}(c) be an (n+p)-dimensional simply connected space form with nonnegative constant curvature c. We prove that if M^n(n\geq4) is a compact submanifold in F^{n+p}(c), and if Ric_M>(n-2)(c+H^2), where H is the mean curvature of M, then M is homeomorphic to a sphere. We also show that the pinching condition above is sharp. Moreover, we obtain a new differentiable sphere theorem for submanifolds with positive Ricci curvature.
