We study here limit spaces (M_\alpha,g_\alpha,p_\alpha)\stackrel{GH}{\rightarrow} (Y,d_Y,p), where the M_\alpha have a lower Ricci curvature bound and are volume noncollapsed. Such limits Y may be quite singular, however it is known that there is a subset of full measure \cR(Y)\subseteq Y, called {\it regular} points, along with coverings by the almost regular points \cap_\epsilon \cup_r\cR_{\epsilon,r}(Y)=\cR(Y) such that each of the {\it Reifenberg sets} \cR_{\epsilon,r}(Y) is bi-H\"older homeomorphic to a manifold. It has been an ongoing question as to the bi-Lipschitz regularity the Reifenberg sets. Our results have two parts in this paper. First we show that each of the sets \cR_{\epsilon,r}(Y) are bi-Lipschitz embeddable into Euclidean space. Conversely, we show the bi-Lipschitz nature of the embedding is sharp. In fact, we construct a limit space Y which is even uniformly Reifenberg, that is, not only is each tangent cone of Y isometric to \RR^n but convergence to the tangent cones is at a uniform rate in Y, such that there exists no C^{1,\beta} embeddings of Y into Euclidean space for any \beta>0. Further, despite the strong tangential regularity of Y, there exists a point y\in Y such that every pair of minimizing geodesics beginning at y branches to any order at y. More specifically, given {\it any} two unit speed minimizing geodesics \gamma_1, \gamma_2 beginning at y and {\it any} 0\leq \theta\leq \pi, there exists a sequence t_i\to 0 such that the angle \angle \gamma_1(t_i)y\gamma_2(t_i) converges to \theta.
