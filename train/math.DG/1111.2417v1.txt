We consider three families of lattices on the oscillator group G, which is an almost nilpotent not completely solvable Lie group, giving rise to coverings G \to M_{k, 0} \to M_{k, \pi} \to M_{k, \pi/2} for k\in \Z. We show that the corresponding families of four dimensional solvmanifolds are not pairwise diffeomorphic and we compute their cohomology and minimal models. In particular, each manifold M_{k, 0} is diffeomorphic to a Kodaira--Thurston manifold, i.e. a compact quotient S^1 \times \Heis_3 (\R) /\Gamma_k where \Gamma_k is a lattice of the real three-dimensional Heisenberg group \Heis_3 (\R). We summarize some geometric aspects of those compact spaces. In particular, we note that any M_{k, 0} provides an example of a solvmanifold whose cohomology does not depend on the Lie algebra only and which admits many symplectic structures that are invariant by the group \R \times\Heis_3 (\R) but not under the oscillator group G.
