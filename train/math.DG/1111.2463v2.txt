We construct the Weil functor T^A corresponding to a general Weil algebra A = K \oplus N: this is a functor from the category of manifolds over a general topological base field or ring K (of arbitrary characteristic) to the category of manifolds over A. This result simultaneously generalizes results known for ordinary, real manifolds, and previous results by the first author for the case of the higher order tangent functors (A = T^k K) and for the case of jet rings (A = K[X]/(X^{k+1})). We investigate some algebraic aspects of these general Weil functors ("K-theory of Weil functors", action of the "Galois group" \Aut_K(A)), which will be of importance for subsequent applications to general differential geometry.
