In this paper, we establish the first variational formula and its Euler-Lagrange equation for the total 2p-th mean curvature functional \mathcal {M}_{2p} of a submanifold M^n in a general Riemannian manifold N^{n+m} for p=0,1,...,[\frac{n}{2}]. As an example, we prove that closed complex submanifolds in complex projective spaces are critical points of the functional \mathcal {M}_{2p}, called relatively 2p-minimal submanifolds, for all p. At last, we discuss the relations between relatively 2p-minimal submanifolds and austere submanifolds in real space forms, as well as a special variational problem.
