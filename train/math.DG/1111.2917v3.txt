Aim of this article is to introduce the notion of integral and geodesic flows on P-supermanifolds as certain partial actions of R . First I introduce the concept of parametrization over a `small' super algebra P, which leads to the notion of P-objects and is superized local deformation theory. It is shown how parametrization makes the theory much easier. A version of Palais' theorem for P-supermanifolds is obtained stating that every infinitesimal P-action of a simply connected P-super Lie group G on a P-supermanifold can be integrated to a whole action of G . Furthermore the faithful linearization of affine P-supermorphisms is proven. Finally I show that Newton's, Lagrange's and Hamilton's approach to mechanics can be formulated also for P- Riemannian supermanifolds and are infact equivalent.
