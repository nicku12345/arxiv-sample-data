We prove an Alexandrov type theorem for a quotient space of \mathbb H^2\times \mathbb R. More precisely we classify the compact embedded surfaces with constant mean curvature in the quotient of \mathbb H^2\times \mathbb R by a subgroup of isometries generated by a parabolic translation along horocycles of \mathbb H^2 and a vertical translation. Moreover, we construct some examples of periodic minimal surfaces in \mathbb H^2\times\mathbb R and we prove a multi-valued Rado theorem for small perturbations of the helicoid in \mathbb H^2\times\mathbb R.
