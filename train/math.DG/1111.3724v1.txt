Based on Lie group method, potential symmetry and invariant solutions for generalized quasilinear hyperbolic equations are studied. To obtain the invariant solutions in explicit form, we focus on the physically interesting situations which admit potential symmetries. Then by using the partial Lagrangian approach, we find conservation laws for this equation in three physically interesting cases.
