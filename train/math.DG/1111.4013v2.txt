In this paper, we study the Ricci flat manifolds with maximal volume growth using Perelman's reduced volume of Ricci flow. We show that if (M^n,g) is an noncompact complete Ricci flat manifold with maximal volume growth satisfying |Rm|(x)\to 0 as d(x)=d_g(x,p)\to \infty, then M^n has the quadratic curvature decay. Some applications to this result are also presented.
