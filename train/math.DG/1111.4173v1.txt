In this paper we describe the local Ricci and Bianchi identities for an h-normal N-linear connection D\Gamma(N) on the dual 1-jet space J^{1*}(T,M). To reach this aim, we firstly give the expressions of the local distinguished (d-) adapted components of torsion and curvature tensors produced by D\Gamma(N), and then we analyze their attached local Ricci identities. The derived deflection d-tensor identities are also presented. Finally, we expose the local expressions of the Bianchi identities (in the particular case of an h-normal N-linear connection of Cartan type), which geometrically connect the local torsion and curvature d-tensors of the linear connection D\Gamma(N).
