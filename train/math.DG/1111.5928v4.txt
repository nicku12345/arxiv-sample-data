Let (M,g) be a complete non-compact Riemannian surface. We consider operators of the form \Delta + aK + W, where \Delta is the non-negative Laplacian, K the Gaussian curvature, W a locally integrable function, and a a positive real number. Assuming that the positive part of W is integrable, we address the question "What conclusions on (M,g) and W can one draw from the fact that the operator \Delta + aK + W is non-negative ?" As a consequence of our main result, we get a new proof of Huber's theorem and Cohn-Vossen's inequality, and we improve earlier results in the particular cases in which W is non-positive and a = 1/4 or a \in (0,1/4).
