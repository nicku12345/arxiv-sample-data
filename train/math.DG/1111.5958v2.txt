In the present paper we study six dimensional solvable Lie algebras with special emphasis on those admitting a symplectic structure. We list all the symplectic structures that they admit and we compute their Betti numbers finding some properties about the codimension of the nilradical. Next, we consider the conjecture of Guan about step of nilpotency of a symplectic solvmanifold finding that it is true for all six dimensional unimodular solvable Lie algebras. Finally, we consider some cohomologies for symplectic manifolds introduced by Tseng and Yau in the context of symplectic Hogde theory and we use them to determine some six dimensional solvmanifolds for which the Hard Lefschetz property holds.
