For a real, non-singular, 2-step nilpotent Lie algebra \mathfrak{n}, the group \Aut(\mathfrak{n})/\Aut_0(\mathfrak{n}), where \Aut_0(\mathfrak{n}) is the group of automorphisms which act trivially on the center, is the direct product of a compact group with the 1-dimensional group of dilations. Maximality of some automorphisms groups of \mathfrak{n} follows and is related to how close is \mathfrak{n} to being of Heisenberg type. For example, at least when the dimension of the center is two, \dim \Aut(\mathfrak{n}) is maximal if and only if \mathfrak{n} is type H. The connection with fat distributions is discussed.
