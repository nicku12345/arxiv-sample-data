We prove some new rigidity results for proper biharmonic immersions in {\mathbb S}^n of the following types: Dupin hypersurfaces; hypersurfaces, both compact and non-compact, with bounded norm of the second fundamental form; hypersurfaces satisfying intrinsic properties; PMC submanifolds; parallel submanifolds.
