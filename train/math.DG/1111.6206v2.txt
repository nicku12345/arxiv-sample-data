In this paper, we build up a min-max theory for minimal surfaces using sweepouts of surfaces of genus g\geq 2. We develop a direct variational methods similar to the proof of the famous Plateau problem by J. Douglas and T. Rado. As a result, we show that the min-max value for the area functional can be achieved by a bubble tree limit consisting of branched genus-g minimal surfaces with nodes, and possibly finitely many branched minimal spheres. We also prove a Colding-Minicozzi type strong convergence theorem similar to the classical mountain pass lemma. Our results extend the min-max theory developed by Colding-Minicozzi and the author to all genera.
