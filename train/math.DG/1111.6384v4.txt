We consider four-dimensional homogeneous pseudo-Riemannian manifolds with non-trivial isotropy and completely classify the cases giving rise to non-trivial homogeneous Ricci solitons. In particular, we show the existence of non-compact homogeneous (and also invariant) pseudo-Riemannian Ricci solitons which are not isometric to solvmanifolds, and of conformally flat homogeneous pseudo-Riemannian Ricci solitons which are not symmetric.
