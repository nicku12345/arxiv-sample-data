We establish a regularity theorem for the Harmonic - Einstein Equation. As a byproduct of the local regularity, we also have a compactness theorem on Harmonic - Einstein equation. The method is mainly the Moser iteration technique which has been used and developed by \cite{BKN89}, \cite{Tian90}, \cite{TV05a} and others.
