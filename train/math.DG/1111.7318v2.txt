We construct many closed, embedded mean curvature self-shrinking surfaces \Sigma_g^2\subseteq\mathbb{R}^3 of high genus g=2k, k\in \mathbb{N}. Each of these shrinking solitons has isometry group equal to the dihedral group on 2g elements, and comes from the "gluing", i.e. desingularizing of the singular union, of the two known closed embedded self-shrinkers in \mathbb{R}^3: The round 2-sphere \mathbb{S}^2, and Angenent's self-shrinking 2-torus \mathbb{T}^2 of revolution. This uses the results and methods N. Kapouleas developed for minimal surfaces in \cite{Ka97}--\cite{Ka}.
