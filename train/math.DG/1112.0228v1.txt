Suppose S is a semispray on a manifold M. We know that the complete lift S^c of S is a semispray on TM with the property that geodesics of S^c correspond to Jacobi fields of S. In this note we generalize this result and show how geodesic variations of k-variables are related to geodesics of the kth iterated complete lift of S. Moreover, for sprays (that is, homogeneous semisprays) we show how geodesic variations of (n-1)-variables are related to a natural generalisation of Jacobi tensors.
