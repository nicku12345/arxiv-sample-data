This paper provides a study of algebraic Ricci solitons in the pseudo-Riemannian case. In the Riemannian case, all nontrivial homogeneous algebraic Ricci solitons are expanding algebraic Ricci solitons. In this paper, we obtain a steady algebraic Ricci soliton and a shrinking algebraic Ricci soliton in the Lorentzian setting.
