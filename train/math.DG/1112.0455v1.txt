For the dual operator s_g'^* of the linearization s_g' of the scalar curvature function, it is well-known that if \ker s_g'^*\neq 0, then s_g is a non-negative constant. In particular, if the Ricci curvature is not flat, then  {s_g}/(n-1) is an eigenvalue of the Laplacian of the metric g. In this work, some variational characterizations were performed for the space \ker s_g'^*. To accomplish this task, we introduce a fourth-order elliptic differential operator \mathcal A and a related geometric invariant \nu. We prove that \nu vanishes if and only if \ker s_g'^* \ne 0, and if the first eigenvalue of the Laplace operator is large compared to its scalar curvature, then \nu is positive and \ker s_g'^*= 0. Furthermore, we calculated the lower bound on \nu in the case of \ker s_g'^* = 0. We also show that if there exists a function which is \mathcal A-superharmonic and the Ricci curvature has a lower bound, then the first non-zero eigenvalue of the Laplace operator has an upper bound.
