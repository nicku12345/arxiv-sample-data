In this paper we will show the following result: Let \mathcal{N}  be a complete (noncompact) connected orientable Riemannian three-manifold with nonnegative scalar curvature S \geq 0 and bounded sectional curvature  K_{s} \leq K . Suposse that \Sigma \subset \mathcal{N}  is a complete orientable connected area-minimizing cylinder so that \pi_1 (\Sigma) \in \pi_1 (\mathcal{N}). Then \mathcal{N} is locally isometric either to \mathbb{S} ^1 \times \mathbb{R} ^2  or \mathbb{S}^1 \times \mathbb{S}^1 \times \mathbb{R} (with the standard product metric).   As a corollary, we will obtain: Let \mathcal{N}  be a complete (noncompact) connected orientable Riemannian three-manifold with nonnegative scalar curvature S \geq 0 and bounded sectional curvature  K_{s} \leq K . Assume that \pi_1 (\mathcal{N}) contains a subgroup which is isomorphic to the fundamental group of a compact surface of positive genus. Then, \mathcal{N} is locally isometric to \mathbb{S}^1 \times \mathbb{S}^1 \times \mathbb{R} (with the standard product metric).
