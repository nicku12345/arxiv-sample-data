We expound some results about the relationships between the Jacobi operators with respect to null vectors on a Lorentzian \mathcal{S}-manifold M and the Jacobi operators with respect to particular spacelike unit vectors on M. We study the number of the eigenvalues of such operators in a \phi-null Osserman Lorentzian \mathcal{S}-manifold, under suitable assumptions on the dimension of the manifold. Then, we generalize a curvature characterization, previously obtained by the first author for Lorentzian \phi-null Osserman \mathcal{S}-manifolds with exactly two characteristic vector fields, to the case of those with an arbitrary number of characteristic vector fields.
