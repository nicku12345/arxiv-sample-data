Let (M^n, g) be a compact K\"ahler manifold with nonpositive bisectional curvature. We show that a finite cover is biholomorphic and isometric to a flat torus bundle over a compact K\"ahler manifold N^k with c_1 < 0. This confirms a conjecture of Yau. As a corollary, for any compact K\"ahler manifold with nonpositive bisectional curvature, the Kodaira dimension is equal to the maximal rank of the Ricci tensor. We also prove a global splitting result under the assumption of certain immersed complex submanifolds.
