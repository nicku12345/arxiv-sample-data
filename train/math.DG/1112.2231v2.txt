Given a positive function F on \mathbb S^n which satisfies a convexity condition, for 1\leq r\leq n, we define for hypersurfaces in \mathbb{R}^{n+1} the r-th anisotropic mean curvature function H_{r; F}, a generalization of the usual r-th mean curvature function. We call a hypersurface is anisotropic minimal if H_F=H_{1; F}=0, and anisotropic r-minimal if H_{r+1; F}=0. Let W be the set of points which are omitted by the hyperplanes tangent to M. We will prove that if an oriented hypersurface M is anisotropic minimal, and the set W is open and non-empty, then x(M) is a part of a hyperplane of \mathbb R^{n+1}. We also prove that if an oriented hypersurface M is anisotropic r-minimal and its r-th anisotropic mean curvature H_{r; F} is nonzero everywhere, and the set W is open and non-empty, then M has anisotropic relative nullity n-r.
