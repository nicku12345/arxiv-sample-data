Given a positive function F on \mathbb S^n which satisfies a convexity condition, for 1\leq r\leq n, we define for hypersurfaces in \mathbb{R}^{n+1} the r-th anisotropic mean curvature function H_{r; F}, a generalization of the usual r-th mean curvature function. We also define L_{r; F} operator, the linearized operator of the r-th anisotropic mean curvature, which is a generalization of the usual L_r operator for hypersurfaces in the Euclidean space \mathbb R^{n+1}. The Reilly type inequalities for the first eigenvalue of the L_{r; F} operator have been proved.
