In Sol_3 space there are three uniparametric groups of isometries. In this work we study constant mean curvature surfaces invariant by one of these groups. We analyze the geometric properties of these surfaces by means of their computer graphics. We construct explicit examples of minimal surfaces and we shall relate them with recent examples of spheres with constant mean curvature.
