We show that symplectic forms taming complex structures on compact manifolds are related to special types of almost generalized K\"ahler structures. By considering the commutator Q of the two associated almost complex structures J_{\pm}, we prove that if either the manifold is 4-dimensional or the distribution {Im} \, Q is involutive, then the manifold can be expressed locally as a disjoint union of twisted Poisson leaves.
