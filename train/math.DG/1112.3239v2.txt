We show that any compact convex simple lattice polytope is the moment polytope of a K\"ahler-Einstein orbifold, unique up to orbifold covering and homothety. We extend the Wang-Zhu Theorem \cite{WZ} giving the existence of a K\"ahler-Ricci soliton on any toric monotone manifold on any compact convex simple labelled polytope satisfying the combinatoric condition corresponding to monotonicity. We obtain that any compact convex simple polytope P\subset \bR^n admits a set of inward normals, unique up to dilatation, such that there exists a symplectic potential satisfying the Guillemin boundary condition (with respect to these normals) and the K\"ahler-Einstein equation on P\times \bR^n. We interpret our result in terms of existence of singular K\"ahler-Einstein metrics on toric manifolds.
