Given a complete isometric immersion \phi: P^m \longrightarrow N^n in an ambient Riemannian manifold N^n with a pole and with radial sectional curvatures bounded from above by the corresponding radial sectional curvatures of a radially symmetric space M^n_w, we determine a set of conditions on the extrinsic curvatures of P that guarantees that the immersion is proper and that P has finite topology, in the line of the paper "On Submanifolds With Tamed Second Fundamental Form", (Glasgow Mathematical Journal, 51, 2009), authored by G. Pacelli Bessa and M. Silvana Costa. When the ambient manifold is a radially symmetric space, it is shown an inequality between the (extrinsic) volume growth of a complete and minimal submanifold and its number of ends which generalizes the classical inequality stated in Anderson's paper "The compactification of a minimal submanifold by the Gauss Map", (Preprint IEHS, 1984), for complete and minimal submanifolds in \erre^n. We obtain as a corollary the corresponding inequality between the (extrinsic) volume growth and the number of ends of a complete and minimal submanifold in the Hyperbolic space together with Bernstein type results for such submanifolds in Euclidean and Hyperbolic spaces, in the vein of the work due to A. Kasue and K. Sugahara "Gap theorems for certain submanifolds of Euclidean spaces and hyperbolic space forms", (Osaka J. Math. 24,1987).
