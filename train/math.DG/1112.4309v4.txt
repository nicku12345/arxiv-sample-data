This paper is motivated by a relatively recent work by Joyce in special Lagrangian geometry, but the basic idea of the present paper goes back to an earlier pioneering work of Donaldson in Yang--Mills gauge theory; Donaldson discovered a global structure of a (compactified) moduli space of Yang--Mills instantons, and a key step to that result was the proof of surjectivity of Taubes' gluing construction.   In special Lagrangian geometry we have currently no such a global understanding of (compactified) moduli spaces, but in the present paper we determine a neighbourhood of a `boundary' point. It is locally similar to Donaldson's result, and in particular as Donaldson's result implies the surjectivity of Taubes' gluing construction so our result implies the surjectivity of Joyce's gluing construction in a certain simple case.
