We prove a conjecture saying that complex projective space has maximal volume (degree) among all toric Kaehler-Einstein manifolds of dimension n. The proof is inspired by our recent work on sharp Moser-Trudinger and Brezis-Merle type inequalities for the complex Monge-Ampere operator, but is essentially self-contained.
