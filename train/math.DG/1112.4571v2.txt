In this paper, we investigate eigenvalues of Laplacian on a bounded domain in an n-dimensional Euclidean space and obtain a sharper lower bound for the sum of its eigenvalues, which gives an improvement of results due to A. D. Melas [15]. On the other hand, for the case of fractional Laplacian (-\Delta)^{\alpha/2}|_{D}, where \alpha\in(0,2], we obtain a sharper lower bound for the sum of its eigenvalues, which gives an improvement of results due to S.Y. Yolcu and T. Yolcu [23].
