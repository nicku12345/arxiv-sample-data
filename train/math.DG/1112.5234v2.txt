In this paper, we prove that for every bumpy Finsler n-sphere (S^n,\,F) with reversibility \lambda and flag curvature K satisfying (\frac{\lambda}{\lambda+1})^2<K\le 1, there exist 2[\frac{n+1}{2}] prime closed geodesics. This gives a confirmed answer to a conjecture of D. V. Anosov \cite{Ano} in 1974 for a generic case.
