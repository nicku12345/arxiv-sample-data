In this paper we study some splitting properties on complete noncompact manifolds with smooth measures when \infty-dimensional Bakry-\'Emery Ricci curvature is bounded from below by some negative constant and spectrum of the weighted Laplacian has a positive lower bound. These results extend the cases of Ricci curvature and m-dimensional Bakry-\'Emery Ricci curvature.
