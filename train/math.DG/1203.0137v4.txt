The canonical-type connection on the almost contact manifolds with B-metric is constructed. It is proved that its torsion is invariant with respect to a subgroup of the general conformal transformations of the almost contact B-metric structure. The basic classes of the considered manifolds are characterized in terms of the torsion of the canonical-type connection.
