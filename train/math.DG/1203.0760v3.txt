We study constant mean curvature 1/2 surfaces in H2xR that admit a compactification of the mean curvature operator. We show that a particular family of complete entire graphs over H2 admits a structure of infinite dimensional manifold with local control on the behaviors at infinity. These graphs also appear to have a half-space property and we deduce a uniqueness result at infinity. Deforming non degenerate constant mean curvature 1/2 annuli, we provide a large class of (non rotational) examples and construct (possibly embedded) annuli without axis, i.e. with two vertical, asymptotically rotational, non aligned ends.
