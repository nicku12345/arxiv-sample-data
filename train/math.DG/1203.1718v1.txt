It is known that complex constant mean curvature ({\sc CMC} for short) immersions in \mathbb C^3 are natural complexifications of {\sc CMC}-immersions in \mathbb R^3. In this paper, conversely we consider {\it real form surfaces} of a complex {\sc CMC}-immersion, which are defined from real forms of the twisted \mathfrak{sl}(2, \mathbb C) loop algebra \Lambda \mathfrak{sl}(2, \mathbb C)_\sigma, and classify all such surfaces according to the classification of real forms of \Lambda \mathfrak{sl}(2, \mathbb C)_\sigma. There are seven classes of surfaces, which are called {\it integrable surfaces}, and all integrable surfaces will be characterized by the (Lorentz) harmonicities of their Gau{\ss} maps into the symmetric spaces S^2, H^2, S^{1,1} or the 4-symmetric space SL(2, \mathbb C)/U(1). We also give a unification to all integrable surfaces via the generalized Weierstra{\ss} type representation.
