Jakobson and Nadirashvili \cite{JN} constructed a sequence of eigenfunctions on T^2 with a bounded number of critical points, answering in the negative the question raised by Yau \cite{Yau1} which asks that whether the number of the critical points of eigenfunctions for the Laplacian increases with the corresponding eigenvalues.   The present paper finds three interesting eigenfunctions on the minimal isoparametric hypersurface M^n in S^{n+1}(1). The corresponding eigenvalues are n, 2n and 3n, while their critical sets consist of 8 points, a submanifold(infinite many points) and 8 points, respectively. On one of its focal submanifolds, a similar phenomenon occurs.
