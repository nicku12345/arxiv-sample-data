In this note it is shown that every 7-dimensional Eschenburg space can be totally geodesically embedded into infinitely many topologically distinct 13-dimensional Bazaikin spaces. Furthermore, examples are given which show that, under the known construction, it is not always possible to totally geodesically embed a positively curved Eschenburg space into a Bazaikin space with positive curvature.
