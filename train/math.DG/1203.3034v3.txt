Simply connected 3-dimensional homogeneous manifolds E(\kappa, \tau), with 4-dimensional isometry group, have a canonical Spin^c structure carrying parallel or Killing spinors. The restriction to any hypersurface of these parallel or Killing spinors allows to characterize isometric immersions of surfaces into E(\kappa, \tau). As application, we get an elementary proof of a Lawson type correspondence for constant mean curvature surfaces in E(\kappa, \tau). Real hypersurfaces of the complex projective space and the complex hyperbolic space are also characterized via Spin^c spinors.
