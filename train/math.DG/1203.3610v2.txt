In this paper we get an explicit lower bound for the radius of a Bergman ball contained in the Dirichlet fundamental polyhedron of a torsion-free discrete group G\subset PU(n,1) acting on complex hyperbolic space. Consequently the volume of all complex hyperbolic n-manifolds is bounded below by the volume of this ball.
