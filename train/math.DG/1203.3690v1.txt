Let D be a set of smooth vector fields on the smooth manifold M.It is known that orbits of D are submanifolds of M. Partition F of M into orbits of D is a singular foliation. In this paper we are studying geometry of foliation which is generated by orbits of a family of Killing vector fields.In the case M=R^3 it is obtained full geometrical classification of F. Throughout this paper the word "smooth" refers to a class C^\infty.
