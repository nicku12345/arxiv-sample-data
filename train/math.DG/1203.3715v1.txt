We investigate singularities of all parallel surfaces to a given regular surface. In generic context, the types of singularities of parallel surfaces are cuspidal edge, swallowtail, cuspidal lips, cuspidal beaks, cuspidal butterfly and 3-dimensional D_4^\pm singularities. We give criteria for these singularities types in terms of differential geometry (Theorem 3.4 and 3.5).
