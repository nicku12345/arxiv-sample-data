We give a complete classification of submanifolds with parallel second fundamental form of a product of two space forms. We also reduce the classification of umbilical submanifolds with dimension m\geq 3 of a product \Q_{k_1}^{n_1}\times \Q_{k_2}^{n_2} of two space forms whose curvatures satisfy k_1+k_2\neq 0 to the classification of m-dimensional umbilical submanifolds of codimension two of \Sf^n\times \R and \Hy^n\times \R. The case of \Sf^n\times \R was carried out in \cite{mt}. As a main tool we derive reduction of codimension theorems of independent interest for submanifolds of products of two space forms.
