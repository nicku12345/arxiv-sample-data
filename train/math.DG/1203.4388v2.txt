Isophote curve consists of a locus of surface points whose normal vectors make a constant angle with a fixed vector (the axis). In this paper, we define an isophote curve on a spacelike surface in Lorentz-Minkowski space and then find its axis as timelike and spacelike vectors via the Darboux frame. Besides, we give some characterizations concerning isophote curve and its axis.
