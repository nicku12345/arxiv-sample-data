The largest class of Riemannian almost product manifolds, which is closed with respect to the group of the conformal transformations of the Riemannian metric, is the class of the conformal Riemannian P-manifolds. This class is an analogue of the class of the conformal K\"ahler manifolds in almost Hermitian geometry. The main aim of this work is to obtain properties of manifolds of this class with connections, whose curvature tensors have similar properties as the K\"ahler tensors in Hermitian geometry.
