Let (M,g) be a complete non-compact Riemannian manifold. We consider operators of the form \Delta_g + V, where \Delta_g is the non-negative Laplacian associated with the metric g, and V a locally integrable function. Let \rho : (\hat{M},\hat{g}) \to (M,g) be a Riemannian covering, with Laplacian \Delta_{\hat{g}} and potential \hat{V} = V \circ \rho. If the operator \Delta + V is non-negative on (M,g), then the operator \Delta_{\hat{g}} + \hat{V} is non-negative on (\hat{M},\hat{g}). In this note, we show that the converse statement is true provided that \pi_1(\hat{M}) is a co-amenable subgroup of \pi_1(M).
