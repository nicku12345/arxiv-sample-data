We consider gradient estimates to positive solutions of porous medium equations and fast diffusion equations: u_t=\Delta_\phi(u^p) associated with the Witten Laplacian on Riemannian manifolds. Under the assumption that the m-dimensional Bakry-Emery Ricci curvature is bounded from below, we obtain gradient estimates which generalize the results in [20] and [13]. Moreover, inspired by X. -D. Li's work in [19] we also study the entropy formulae introduced in [20] for porous medium equations and fast diffusion equations associated with the Witten Laplacian. We prove monotonicity theorems for such entropy formulae on compact Riemannian manifolds with non-negative m-dimensional Bakry-Emery Ricci curvature
