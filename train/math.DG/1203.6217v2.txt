In this study, we investigate the existence theorems for timelike ruled surfaces in Minkowski 3-space. We obtain a general system and give the existence theorems for a timelike ruled surface according to Gaussian curvature, distribution parameter and strictional distance. Moreover, we give some special cases such as the directirx of the surface is a geodesic, an asymptotic line, a line of curvature or a general helix.
