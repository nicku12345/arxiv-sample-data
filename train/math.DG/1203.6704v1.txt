We consider 2-dimensional orientable self-shrinkers \Sigma for the Mean Curvature Flow of polynomial volume growth immersed in \mathbb R^n. We look at closed one forms minimizing the norm \int_\Sigma \eterm |\omega|^2 in their cohomology class. Any closed form satisfying the Euler-Lagrange equation for this minimization will be called a Gaussian Harmonic one Form (GHF).   We then use these forms to show that if such a \Sigma has genus \geq 1, then we have a lower bound on the supremum norm of A^2. GHF's may also be applied to create an upperbound for the lowest eigenvalue of the operator L. In the codimension one case \Sigma \to \mathbb R^3, for certain conditions on the principal curvatures, we use GHF's to get a lower bound on the index of L depending on the genus g. Likewise, in the compact codimension one case we obtain an estimate of the lowest eigenvalue of L and also on \inf |x|^2.
