Cocalibrated G_2-structures are structures naturally induced on hypersurfaces in Spin(7)-manifolds. Conversely, one may start with a seven-dimensional manifold M endowed with a cocalibrated G_2-structure and construct via the Hitchin flow a Spin(7)-manifold which contains M as a hypersurface. In this article, we consider left-invariant cocalibrated G_2-structures on Lie groups G which are a direct product G=G_4\times G_3 of a four-dimensional Lie group G_4 and a three-dimensional Lie group G_3. We achieve a full classification of the Lie groups G=G_4\times G_3 which admit a left-invariant cocalibrated G_2-structure.
