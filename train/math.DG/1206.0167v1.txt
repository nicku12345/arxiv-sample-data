In this paper, we study strictly convex affine hypersurfaces centroaffinely congruent to their centre map, in the case when the shape operator has two distinct eigenvalues: one of multiplicity 1, and one nonzero of multiplicity n-1. We show how to construct them from (n-1)-dimensional affine hyperspheres.
