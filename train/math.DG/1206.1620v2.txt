A Ricci surface is a Riemannian 2-manifold (M,g) whose Gaussian curvature K satisfies K\Delta K+g(dK,dK)+4K^3=0. Every minimal surface isometrically embedded in \mathbb{R}^3 is a Ricci surface of non-positive curvature. At the end of the 19th century Ricci-Curbastro has proved that conversely, every point x of a Ricci surface has a neighborhood which embeds isometrically in \mathbb{R}^3 as a minimal surface, provided K(x)<0. We prove this result in full generality by showing that Ricci surfaces can be locally isometrically embedded either minimally in \mathbb{R}^3 or maximally in \mathbb{R}^{2,1}, including near points of vanishing curvature. We then develop the theory of closed Ricci surfaces, possibly with conical singularities, and construct classes of examples in all genera g\geq 2.
