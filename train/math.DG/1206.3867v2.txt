Sub-Riemannian structures on odd-dimensional spheres respecting the Hopf fibration naturally appear in quantum mechanics. We study the curvature maps for such a sub-Riemannian structure and express them using the Riemannian curvature tensor of the Fubini-Study metric of the complex projective space and the curvature form of the Hopf fibration. We also estimate the number of conjugate points of a sub-Riemannian extremal in terms of the bounds of the sectional curvature and the curvature form. It presents a typical example for the study of curvature maps and comparison theorms for a general corank 1 sub-Riemannian structure with symmetries done by C.Li and I.Zelenko.
