The Mishchenko-Fomenko conjecture says that for each real or complex finite-dimensional Lie algebra \goth g there exists a complete set of commuting polynomials on its dual space \goth g^*. In terms of the theory of integrable Hamiltonian systems this means that the dual space \goth g^* endowed with the standard Lie-Poisson bracket admits polynomial integrable Hamiltonian systems. Recently this conjecture has been proved by S.T. Sadetov. Following his idea, we give an explicit geometric construction for commuting polynomials on \goth g^* and consider some examples.
