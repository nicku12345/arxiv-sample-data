Defining Lorentzian Sabban frame of the unit speed time-like curves on de Sitter 2-space \mathbb{S}^{2}_{1} and introducing space-like height function on the unit speed time-like curves on \mathbb{S}^{2}_{1}, the invariants of the unit speed time-like curves on \mathbb{S}^{2}_{1} and geometric properties of de Sitter evolutes of the unit speed time-like curves on \mathbb{S}^{2}_{1} are studied. A relation between space-like Bertrand curves and helices is obtained. De Sitter Darboux images of space-like Bertrand curves are equal to de Sitter evolutes. The relations between time-like constant slope surfaces lying in the space-like cone and space-like Bertrand curves in Minkowski 3-space \mathbb{R}^{3}_{1} are obtained.
