We give numerous examples of almost Lie algebroids arising as Dirac structures in pre-Courant algebroids, e.g. from twisted Poisson structures, as well as from twisted actions of a Lie algebra. We moreover define a cohomology for them, motivated by a Q-structure, that is trivial for (bundles of) Lie algebras but characterizes the underlying integrable distribution the image of the anchor map.
