We compare two ways of interpreting higher order connections. The geometric approach lies in the decomposition of higher order tangent space into the horizontal and vertical structures while the jet--like approach considers a higher order connection as the section of a jet prolongation of a fibered manifold. Particularly, we use the Ehresmann prolongation of a general connection and study the result from the point of view of geometric theory. We pay attention to linear connections, too.
