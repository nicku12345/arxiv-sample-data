We construct lattices on six dimensional not completely solvable almost abelian Lie groups, for which the Mostow condition does not hold. For the corresponding compact quotients, we compute the de Rham cohomology (which does not agree in general with the Lie algebra one) and a minimal model. We show that some of these solvmanifolds admit not invariant symplectic structures and we study formality and Lefschetz properties.
