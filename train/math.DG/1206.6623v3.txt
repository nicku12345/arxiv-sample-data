The holonomy algebras of Einstein not Ricci-flat pseudo-Riemannian manifolds of arbitrary signature are classified. As illustrating examples, the cases of Lorentzian manifolds, pseudo-Riemannian manifolds of signature (2,n) and the para-quaternionic-K\"ahlerian manifolds with non-zero scalar curvature are considered. Einstein not Ricci-flat metrics of signature (2,n) with all possible holonomy algebras are given.
