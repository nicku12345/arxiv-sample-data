It is a classical result that any complex analytic Lie supergroup \mathcal{G} is split \cite{kosz}, that is its structure sheaf is isomorphic to the structure sheaf of a certain vector bundle. However, there do exist non-split complex analytic homogeneous supermanifolds.   We study the question how to find out whether a complex analytic homogeneous supermanifold is split or non-split. Our main result is a description of left invariant gradings on a complex analytic homogeneous supermanifold \mathcal{G}/\mathcal{H} in the terms of \mathcal{H}-invariants. As a corollary to our investigations we get some simple sufficient conditions for a complex analytic homogeneous supermanifold to be split in terms of Lie algebras.
