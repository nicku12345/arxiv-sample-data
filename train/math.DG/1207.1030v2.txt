Given a null hypersurface L of a Lorentzian manifold, we construct a Riemannian metric \widetilde{g} on it from a fixed transverse vector field \zeta. We study the relationship between the ambient Lorentzian manifold, the Riemannian manifold (L,\widetilde{g}) and the vector field \zeta. As an application, we prove some new results on null hypersurfaces, as well as known ones, using Riemannian techniques.
