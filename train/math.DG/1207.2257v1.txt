Recently, M. Atcken studied Contact CR-warped prod- uct submanifolds in cosymplectic space forms and established gen- eral sharp inequalities for CR-warped products in a cosymplectic manifold [1]. In the present paper, we obtain an inequality for the squared norm of the second fundamental form in terms of constant ?\phi-sectional curvature for hemi-slant products in cosymplectic mani- folds. An inequality for hemi-slant warped products in a cosymplectc manifold is also given. The equality case is considered.
