We extend to the eigenvalues of the hypersurface Spin^c Dirac operator well known lower and upper bounds. Examples of limiting cases are then given. Futhermore, we prove a correspondence between the existence of a Spin^c Killing spinor on homogeneous 3-dimensional manifolds \mathbb E^*(\kappa, \tau) with 4-dimensional isometry group and isometric immersions of \mathbb E^*(\kappa, \tau) into the complex space form \mathbb M^4(c) of constant holomorphic sectional curvature 4c, for some c\in \mathbb R^*. As applications, we show the non-existence of totally umbilic surfaces in \mathbb E^*(\kappa, \tau) and we give necessary and sufficient geometric conditions to immerse a 3-dimensional Sasaki manifold into \mathbb M^4(c).
