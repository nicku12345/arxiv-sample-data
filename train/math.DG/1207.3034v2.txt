Let M = G/H be a connected simply connected homogeneous manifold of a compact, not necessarily connected Lie group G. We will assume that the isotropy H-module \mathfrak {g/h} has a simple spectrum, i.e. irreducible submodules are mutually non-equivalent.   There exists a convex Newton polytope N=N(G,H), which was used for the estimation of the number of isolated complex solutions of the algebraic Einstein equation for invariant metrics on G/H (up to scaling). Using the moment map, we identify the space \mathcal{M}_1 of invariant Riemannian metrics of volume 1 on G/H with the interior of this polytope N.   We associate with a point {x \in \partial N} of the boundary a homogeneous Riemannian space (in general, only local) and we extend the Einstein equation to \bar{\mathcal{M}_1}= N. As an application of the Aleksevsky--Kimel'fel'd theorem, we prove that all solutions of the Einstein equation associated with points of the boundary are locally Euclidean.   We describe explicitly the set T\subset \partial N of solutions at the boundary together with its natural triangulation.   Investigating the compactification \bar{\mathcal{M}_1}  of \mathcal{M}_1, we get an algebraic proof of the deep result by B\"ohm, Wang and Ziller about the compactness of the set  \mathcal{E}_1 \subset \mathcal{M}_1 of Einstein metrics. The original proof by B\"ohm, Wang and Ziller was based on a different approach and did not use the simplicity of the spectrum.   In Appendix we consider the non-symmetric K\"ahler homogeneous spaces G/H with the second Betti number b_2=1. We write the normalized volumes 2,6,20,82,344 of the corresponding Newton polytopes and discuss the number of complex solutions of the algebraic Einstein equation and the finiteness problem.
