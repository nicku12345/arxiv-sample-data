We study the G_2 analogue of the Goldberg conjecture on non-compact solvmanifolds. In contrast to the almost-K\"ahler case we prove that a 7-dimensional solvmanifold cannot admit any left-invariant calibrated G_2-structure \varphi such that the induced metric g_{\varphi} is Einstein, unless g_{\varphi} is flat. We give an example of 7-dimensional solvmanifold admitting a left-invariant calibrated G_2-structure \varphi such that g_{\varphi} is Ricci-soliton. Moreover, we show that a 7-dimensional (non-flat) Einstein solvmanifold (S,g) cannot admit any left-invariant cocalibrated G_2-structure \varphi such that the induced metric g_{\varphi} = g.
