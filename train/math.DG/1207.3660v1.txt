To each second-order ordinary differential equation \sigma  on a smooth manifold M a G-structure P^\sigma  on J^1(\mathbb{R},M) is associated and the Chern connection \nabla ^\sigma  attached to \sigma  is proved to be reducible to P^\sigma ; in fact, P^\sigma  coincides generically with the holonomy bundle of \nabla ^\sigma . The cases of unimodular and orthogonal holonomy are also dealt with. Two characterizations of the Chern connection are given: The first one in terms of the corresponding covariant derivative and the second one as the only principal connection on P^\sigma  with prescribed torsion tensor field. The properties of the curvature tensor field of \nabla ^\sigma  in relationship to the existence of special coordinate systems for \sigma  are studied. Moreover, all the odd-degree characterictic classes on P^\sigma  are seen to be exact and the usual characteristic classes induced by \nabla ^\sigma  determine the Chern classes of M. The maximal group of automorphisms of the projection p\colon \mathbb{R}\times M\to \mathbb{R} with respect to which \nabla ^\sigma  has a functorial behaviour, is proved to be the group of p-vertical automorphisms. The notion of a differential invariant under such a group is defined and stated that second-order differential invariants factor through the curvature mapping; a structure is thus established for KCC theory.
