We prove that the Euler characteristic of an even-dimensional compact manifold with positive (nonnegative) sectional curvature is positive (nonnegative) provided that the manifold admits an isometric action of a compact Lie group G with principal isotropy group H and cohomogeneity k such that k - (\rank G - \rank H)\le 5. Moreover, we prove that the Euler characteristic of a compact Riemannian manifold M^{4l+4} or M^{4l+2} with positive sectional curvature is positive if M admits an effective isometric action of a torus T^l, i.e., if the symmetry rank of M is \ge l.
