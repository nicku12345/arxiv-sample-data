We refurbish our axiomatics of differential geometry introduced in [Mathematics for Applications,, 1 (2012), 171-182]. Then the notion of Euclideaness can naturally be formulated. The principal objective in this paper is to present an adaptation of our theory of differential forms developed in [International Journal of Pure and Applied Mathematics, 64 (2010), 85-102] to our present axiomatic framework.
