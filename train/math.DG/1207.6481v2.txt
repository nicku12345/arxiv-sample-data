The hermitian analog of Aleksandrov's area measures of convex bodies is investigated. A characterization of those area measures which arise as the first variation of unitarily invariant valuations is established. General smooth area measures are shown to form a module over smooth valuations and the module of unitarily invariant area measures is described explicitly.
