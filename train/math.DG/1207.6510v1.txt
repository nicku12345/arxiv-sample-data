It is the purpose of the present paper to outline an introduction in theory of embeddings in the manifold Osc^{2}M. First, we recall the notion of 2-osculator bundle. The second section is dedicated to the notion of submanifold in the total space of the 2-osculator bundle, the manifold Osc^{2}M. A moving frame is constructed. The induced N-linear connections and the relative covariant derivatives are discussed in third and fourth sections. The Ricci identities of the Liouville d-vector fields are present in the last section.
