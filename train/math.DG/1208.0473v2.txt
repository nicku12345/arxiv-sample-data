We consider a non-negative biminimal properly immersed submanifold M (that is, a biminimal properly immersed submanifold with \lambda\geq0) in a complete Riemannian manifold N with non-positive sectional curvature. Assume that the sectional curvature K^N of N satisfies K^N\geq-L(1+{\rm dist}_N(\cdot, q_0)^2)^{\frac{\alpha}{2}} for some L>0, 2>\alpha \geq 0 and q_0\in N. Then, we prove that M is minimal. As a corollary, we give that any biharmonic properly immersed submanifold in a hyperbolic space is minimal. These results give affirmative partial answers to the global version of generalized Chen's conjecture.
