In this paper almost complex surfaces of the nearly K\"ahler S^3\times S^3 are studied in a systematic way. We show that on such a surface it is possible to define a global holomorphic differential, which is induced by an almost product structure on the nearly K\"ahler S^3\times S^3. We also find a correspondence between almost complex surfaces in the nearly K\"ahler S^3\times S^3 and solutions of the general H-system equation introduced by Wente, thus obtaining a geometric interpretation of solutions of the general H-system equation. From this we deduce a correspondence between constant mean curvature surfaces in \mathbb R^3 and almost complex surfaces in the nearly K\"ahler S^3\times S^3 with vanishing holomorphic differential. This correspondence allows us to obtain a classification of the totally geodesic almost complex surfaces. Moreover, we will prove that almost complex topological 2-spheres in S^3\times S^3 are totally geodesic. Finally, we also show that every almost complex surface with parallel second fundamental form is totally geodesic.
