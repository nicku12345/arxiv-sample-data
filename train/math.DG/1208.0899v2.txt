We deal with Riemannian properties of the octonionic Hopf fibration S^{15}-->S^8, in terms of the structure given by its symmetry group Spin(9). In particular, we show that any vertical vector field has at least one zero, thus reproving the non-existence of S^1 subfibrations. We then discuss Spin(9)-structures from a conformal viewpoint and determine the structure of compact locally conformally parallel Spin(9)-manifolds. Eventually, we give a list of examples of locally conformally parallel Spin(9)-manifolds.
