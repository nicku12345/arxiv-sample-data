We consider non-degenerate centro-affine hypersurface immersions in R^n whose cubic form is parallel with respect to the Levi-Civita connection of the affine metric. There exists a bijective correspondence between homothetic families of proper affine hyperspheres with center in the origin and with parallel cubic form, and K\"ochers conic omega-domains, which are the maximal connected sets consisting of invertible elements in a real semi-simple Jordan algebra. Every level surface of the omega function in an omega-domain is an affine complete, Euclidean complete proper affine hypersphere with parallel cubic form and with center in the origin. On the other hand, every proper affine hypersphere with parallel cubic form and with center in the origin can be represented as such a level surface. We provide a complete classification of proper affine hyperspheres with parallel cubic form based on the classification of semi-simple real Jordan algebras. Centro-affine hypersurface immersions with parallel cubic form are related to the wider class of real unital Jordan algebras. Every such immersion can be extended to an affine complete one, whose conic hull is the connected component of the unit element in the set of invertible elements in a real unital Jordan algebra. Our approach can be used to study also other classes of hypersurfaces with parallel cubic form.
