The refined analytic torsion on compact Riemannian manifolds with boundary has been discussed by B. Vertman and the authors, but these two constructions are completely different. Vertman used a double of de Rham complex consisting of the minimal and maximal closed extensions of a flat connection and the authors used well-posed boundary conditions {\mathcal P}_{-, {\mathcal L}_{0}}, {\mathcal P}_{+, {\mathcal L}_{1}} for the odd signature operator. In this paper we compare these two constructions by using the BFK-gluing formula for zeta-determinants, the adiabatic method for stretching cylinder part near boundary and the deformation method used in [6], when the odd signature operator comes from a Hermitian flat connection and all de Rham cohomologies vanish.
