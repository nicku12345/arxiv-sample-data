Let M be a closed hypersurface in a noncompact rank-1 symmetric space (\bar{\mathbb{M}}, ds^2) with -4 \leq K_{\bar{\mathbb{M}}} \leq -1, or in a complete, simply connected Riemannian manifold \mathbb{M} such that 0 \leq K_{\mathbb{M}} \leq \delta^2 or K_{\mathbb{M}} \leq k where k = -\delta^2 or 0. In this paper we give sharp upperbounds for the first eigenvalue of laplacian of M.
