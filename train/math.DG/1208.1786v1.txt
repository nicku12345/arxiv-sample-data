Perez proved some L^2 inequalities for closed convex hypersurfaces immersed in the Euclidean space \mathbb{R}^{n+1}, more generally, for closed hypersurfaces with non-negative Ricci curvature, immersed in an Einstein manifold. In this paper, we discuss the rigidity of these inequalities when the ambient manifold is \mathbb{R}^{n+1}, the hyperbolic space \mathbb{H}^{n+1}, or the closed hemisphere \mathbb{S}_+^{n+1}. We also obtain a generalization of the Perez's theorem to the hypersurfaces without the hypothesis of non-negative Ricci curvature.
