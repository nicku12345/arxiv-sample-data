We characterize certain CR structures of arbitrary codimension (different from 3, 4 and 5) on Riemannian Spin^c manifolds by the existence of a Spin^c structure carrying a strictly partially pure spinor field. Furthermore, we study the geometry of Riemannian Spin^c manifolds carrying a strictly partially pure spinor which satisfies the generalized Killing equation in prescribed directions.
