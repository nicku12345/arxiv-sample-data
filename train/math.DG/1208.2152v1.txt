In our previous paper in \cite{C}, we generalized the almost-Schur lemma of De Lellis and Topping for closed manifolds with nonnegative Rcci curvature to any closed manifolds. In this paper, we generalize the above results to symmetric (2,0)-tensors and give the applications including rth mean curvatures of closed hypersurfaces in a space form and k scalar curvatures for closed locally conformally flat manifolds.
