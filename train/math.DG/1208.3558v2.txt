We develop Hodge theory for a Riemannian manifold (M,g) with a background closed 3-form, H. Precisely, we prove that if the metric connections with torsion \pm H have holonomy groups G_\pm, then the d^H-Laplacian preserves the irreducible representations of the Lie algebras of the holonomy groups on the space of forms.
