For an n-dimensional polytope \Omega in \mathbb{R}^{n}, we study lower bounds for eigenvalues of the Dirichlet eigenvalue problem of the Laplacian. In the asymptotic formula on the average of the first k eigenvalues, Li and Yau (1983) obtained the first term with the order k^{\frac2n}, which is optimal. The next landmark goal is to give the second term with the order k^{\frac1n} in the asymptotic formula. For this purpose, Kova\v{r}\'{\i}k, Vugalter and Weidl (2009) have made an important breakthrough in the case of dimension 2. It is our purpose to study the n-dimensional case for arbitrary dimension n. We obtain the second term in the asymptotic sense.
