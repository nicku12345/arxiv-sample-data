We construct the first examples of complete, properly embedded minimal surfaces in \mathbb{H}^2 \times \mathbb{R} with finite total curvature and positive genus. These are constructed by gluing copies of horizontal catenoids or other nondegenerate summands. We also establish that every horizontal catenoid is nondegenerate.   Finally, using the same techniques, we are able to produce properly embedded minimal surfaces with infinitely many ends. Each annular end has finite total curvature and is asymptotic to a vertical totally geodesic plane.
