As a generalization of slant submersions (Sahin, 2011), semi-slant submersions (Park and Prasad), and slant Riemannian maps (Sahin), we define the notion of semi-slant Riemannian maps from almost Hermitian manifolds to Riemannian manifolds. We study the integrability of distributions, the geometry of fibers, the harmonicity of such maps, etc. We also find a condition for such maps to be totally geodesic and investigate some decomposition theorems. Moreover, we give examples.
