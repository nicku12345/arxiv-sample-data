A well-known and interesting family of sub-Riemannian space are the systems involving two balls rolling against each other without slipping or twisting. In this note, we show how the sub-Riemannian geodesics of these space, when the two balls are embedded in \mathbb{R}^3 \times \mathbb{R}^3, are horizontal curves on the intersections of these balls with Euclidean 5-planes.
