There is a natural filtration on the space of degree-k homogeneous polynomials in n independent variables with coefficients in the algebra of smooth functions on the Grassmannian \mathrm{Gr}(n,s), determined by the tautological bundle. In this paper we show that the space of s-dimensional integral elements of a Cartan plane on J^{k-1}(E,n), with \mathrm{dim}\, E=n+m, has an affine bundle structure modeled by the the so-obtained bundles over \mathrm{Gr}(n,s), and we study a natural distribution associated with it. As an example, we show that a third-order nonlinear PDE of Monge-Amp\`ere type is not contact-equivalent to a quasi-linear one.
