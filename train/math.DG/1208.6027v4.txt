Assume (M,g,\Omega) is a closed, oriented Riemannian surface equipped with an Anosov magnetic flow. We establish certain results on the surjectivity of the adjoint of the magnetic ray transform, and use these to prove the injectivity of the magnetic ray transform on sums of tensors of degree at most two. In the final section of the paper we give an application to the entropy production of magnetic flows perturbed by symmetric 2-tensors.
