The last years have seen striking improvements on Vaisman's question about existence of locally conformally K\"ahler (lcK) metrics on compact complex surfaces. The aim of this paper is two-fold. We review results of different authors which, for all known examples of compact complex surfaces, give a complete answer to Vaisman's question. We also point out a relation between lcK surfaces and generalized K\"ahler geometry in four-dimension and prove a new result concerning generalized K\"ahler structures on Hyperbolic Inoue surfaces. We conclude with a simple observation on a question of Brunella.
