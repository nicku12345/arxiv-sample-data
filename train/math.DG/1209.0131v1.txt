This paper presents two results conserning real hypersurfaces in CP^{2} and CH^{2}. More precisely, it is proved that real hypersurfaces equipped with structure Jacobi operator satisfying condition \mathcal{L}_{X}l=\nabla_{X}l, where \emph{X} is a vector field orthogonal to structure vector field \xi, do not exist. Additional real hypersurfaces equipped with shape operator \emph{A} satisfying relation \mathcal{L}_{X}A=\nabla_{X}A, where \emph{X} is a vector field orthogonal to \xi, do not exist.
