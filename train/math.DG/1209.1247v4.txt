In this paper is proposed a kind of model theory for our axiomatic differential geometry. It is claimed that smooth manifolds, which have occupied the center stage in differential geometry, should be replaced by functors on the category of Weil algebras. Our model theory is geometrically natural and conceptually motivated, while the model theory of synthetic differential geometry is highly artificial and exquisitely technical.
