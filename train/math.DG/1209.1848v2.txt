In the paper we develop a framework for the alternative way of the study of a local geometry of almost cosymplectic manifolds with Kahlerian leaves. The main idea is to apply the concept of a geometry and analysis of CR manifolds. Locally the almost cosymplectic manifold is modeled on the 'mixed' space RxCn. There is given a complete local description of the underlying almost contact metric structure in the system of local, mixed - real, complex- coordinates. We also introduce a notion of a canonical Hermitian complex connection in the CR structure of a CR almost cosymplectic manifold. As an example we provide detailed descritpion of almost cosymplectic (-1,\mu,0)-spaces.
