We show that for every compact domain in a Euclidean space with d.c. (delta-convex) boundary there exists a unique Legendrian cycle such that the associated curvature measures fulfil a local version of the Gauss-Bonnet formula. This was known in dimensions two and three and was open in higher dimensions. In fact, we show this property for a larger class of sets including also lower-dimensional sets. We also describe the local index function of the Legendrian cycles and we show that the associated curvature measures fulfill the Crofton formula.
