We give a purely geometrical smooth characterization of closed infrasolv manifolds and orbifolds by showing that, up to diffeomorphism, these are precisely the spaces which admit a collapse with bounded curvature and diameter to compact flat orbifolds. Moreover, we distinguish irreducible smooth fake tori geometrically from standard ones by proving that the former have non-vanishing D-minimal volume.
