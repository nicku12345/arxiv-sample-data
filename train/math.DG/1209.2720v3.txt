The aim of this note is to prove that any compact non-trivial almost Ricci soliton \big(M^n,\,g,\,X,\,\lambda\big) with constant scalar curvature is isometric to a Euclidean sphere \Bbb{S}^{n}. As a consequence we obtain that every compact non-trivial almost Ricci soliton with constant scalar curvature is gradient. Moreover, the vector field X decomposes as the sum of a Killing vector field Y and the gradient of a suitable function.
