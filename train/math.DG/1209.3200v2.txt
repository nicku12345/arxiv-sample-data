Minimal and CMC surfaces in S^3 can be treated via their associated family of flat \SL(2,\C)-connections. In this the paper we parametrize the moduli space of flat \SL(2,\C)-connections on the Lawson minimal surface of genus 2 which are equivariant with respect to certain symmetries of Lawson's geometric construction. The parametrization uses Hitchin's abelianization procedure to write such connections explicitly in terms of flat line bundles on a complex 1-dimensional torus. This description is used to develop a spectral curve theory for the Lawson surface. This theory applies as well to other CMC and minimal surfaces with the same holomorphic symmetries as the Lawson surface but different Riemann surface structure. Additionally, we study the space of isospectral deformations of compact minimal surface of genus g\geq2 and prove that it is generated by simple factor dressing.
