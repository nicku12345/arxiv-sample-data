By the work of Li, a compact co-K\"ahler manifold M is a mapping torus K_\varphi, where K is a K\"ahler manifold and \varphi is a Hermitian isometry. We show here that there is always a finite cyclic cover \bar M of the form \bar M \cong K \times S^1, where \cong is equivariant diffeomorphism with respect to an action of S^1 on M and the action of S^1 on K \times S^1 by translation on the second factor. Furthermore, the covering transformations act diagonally on S^1, K and are translations on the S^1 factor. In this way, we see that, up to a finite cover, all compact co-K\"ahler manifolds arise as the product of a K\"ahler manifold and a circle.
