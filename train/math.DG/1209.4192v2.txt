Using the method of De Lellis-Topping, we prove some almost Schur type results. For example, one of our results gives a quantitative measure of how close the higher mean curvature of a submanifold is to its average value. We also derive another sharp Andrews-De Lellis-Topping type inequality involving the Riemannian curvature tensor and discuss its equality case.
