Let (M, g), (N, h) be compact Riemannian manifolds without boundary, and let f be a smooth map from M into N. We consider a covariant symmetric tensor T_f = {\displaystyle f^*h - \frac{1}{m} |df|^2 g}, where f^*h denotes the pull-back metric of h by f. The tensor T_f vanishes if and only if the map f is weakly conformal. The norm |T_f| is a quantity which is a measure of conformality of f at each point. We are concerned with maps which are critical points of the functional \Phi (f) = {\displaystyle \int_M |T_f|^2dv_g}. We call such maps {\it C-stationary maps}. Any conformal map or more generally any weakly conformal map is a C-stationary map. It is of interest to find when a C-stationary map is a (weakly) conformal map.   In this paper we prove the following result. If f is a stable C-stationary maps from the standard sphere {\mathrm S}^m (m \geq 5) or into the standard sphere {\mathrm S}^n (n \geq 5), then f is a weakly conformal map.
