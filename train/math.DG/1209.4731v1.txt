In monograph of D. E. Blair "Riemannian geometry of contact and symplectic manifolds" and in the paper of S. Zamkovoy "Canonical connections on paracontact manifolds", the curvature identities respectively for contact and paracontact metric manifold are proved. We obtain the curvature identity in the wider class of manifolds, which generalizes results presented in above mentioned publications. Moreover, we present some properties of almost (para)hermitian structure on a special semiproduct of R+ and an almost (para)contact metric manifold. This semiproduct plays an auxiliary role in proving main theorem.
