In this paper, by introducing a notion of local quasi holomorphic frame, we obtain a curvature formula for almost Hermitian manifolds which is similar to that of Hermitian manifolds. Moreover, as applications of the curvature formula, we extend a result of H.S. Wu and a result of F. Zheng to almost Hermitian manifolds.
