As a generalization of slant Riemannian maps (Sahin), semi-slant Riemannian maps (Park), almost h-slant submersions (Park 2012), and almost h-semi-slant submersions (Park 2011), we introduce the notion of almost h-semi-slant Riemannian maps from almost quaternionic Hermitian manifolds to Riemannian manifolds. We investigate the integrability of distributions, the harmonicity of such maps, the geometry of fibers, etc. We also deal with the condition for such maps to be totally geodesic and study some decomposition theorems. Moreover, we give some examples.
