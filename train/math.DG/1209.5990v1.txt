In this paper, by using the Bochner technique on almost Hermitian manifolds, we obtain a complex Hessian comparison for almost Hermitian manifolds generalizing the Laplacian comparison for almost Hermitian manifolds by Tossati, and reprove a diameter estimate for almost Hermitian manifolds by Gray. Moreover, we obtain a sharp eigenvalue estimate on quasi Kaehler manifolds and a sharp Hessian comparison on nearly Kaehler manifolds.
