We define Dorfman connections, which are to Courant algebroids what connections are to Lie algebroids. Several examples illustrate this analogy. A linear connection \nabla\colon \mathfrak{X}(M)\times\Gamma(E)\to\Gamma(E) on a vector bundle E over a smooth manifold M is tantamount to a linear splitting TE\simeq T^{q_E}E\oplus H_\nabla, where T^{q_E}E is the set of vectors tangent to the fibres of E. Furthermore, the curvature of the connection measures the failure of the horizontal space H_\nabla to be integrable. We show that linear horizontal complements to T^{q_E}E\oplus (T^{q_E}E)^\circ in the Pontryagin bundle over the vector bundle E can be described in the same manner via a certain class of Dorfman connections \Delta\colon \Gamma(TM\oplus E^*)\times\Gamma(E\oplus T^*M)\to\Gamma(E\oplus T^*M). Similarly to the tangent bundle case, we find that, after the choice of a linear splitting, the standard Courant algebroid structure of TE\oplus T^*E\to E can be completely described by properties of the Dorfman connection. As an application, we study splittings of TA\oplus T^*A over a Lie algebroid A and, following Gracia-Saz and Mehta, we compute the representations up to homotopy defined by any linear splitting of TA\oplus T^*A and the linear Lie algebroid TA\oplus T^*A\to TM\oplus A^*. Further, we characterise VB- and LA-Dirac structures in TA\oplus T^*A via Dorfman connections.
