In this paper, we prove a classification theorem for the stable compact minimal submanifolds of the Riemannian product of an m_1-dimensional (m_1\geq3) hypersurface M_1 in the Euclidean space and any Riemannian manifold M_2, when the sectional curvature K_{M_1} of M_1 satisfies \frac{1}{\sqrt{m_1-1}}\leq K_{M_1}\leq 1. This gives a generalization to the results of F. Torralbo and F. Urbano [9], where they obtained a classification theorem for the stable minimal submanifolds of the Riemannian product of a sphere and any Riemannian manifold. In particular, when the ambient space is an m-dimensional (m\geq3) complete hypersurface M in the Euclidean space, if the sectional curvature K_{M} of M satisfies \frac{1}{\sqrt{m+1}}\leq K_{M}\leq 1, then we conclude that there exist no stable compact minimal submanifolds in M.
