We prove that if a family of metrics, g_i, on a compact Riemannian manifold, M^n, have a uniform lower Ricci curvature bound and converge to g_\infty smoothly away from a singular set, S, with Hausdorff measure, H^{n-1}(S) = 0, and if there exists connected precompact exhaustion, W_j, of M^n \setminus S satisfying \diam_{g_i}(M^n) \le D_0 , \vol_{g_i}(\partial W_j) \le A_0  and \vol_{g_i}(M^n \setminus W_j) \le V_j where \lim_{j\to\infty}V_j=0  then the Gromov-Hausdorff limit exists and agrees with the metric completion of (M^n \setminus S, g_\infty). Recall that in the prior work with Sormani the same conclusion is reached but the singular set is assumed to be a submanifold of codimension two. We have a second main theorem in which the Hausdorff measure condition on S is replaced by diameter estimates on the connected components of the boundary of the exhaustion, \partial W_j. In addition, we show that the uniform lower Ricci curvature bounds in these theorems can be replaced by the existence of a uniform linear contractibility function. If this condition is removed altogether, then we prove that \lim_{j\to \infty} d_{\mathcal{F}}(M_j', N')=0, in which M_j' and N' are the settled completions of (M, g_j) and (M_\infty\setminus S, g_\infty) respectively and d_{\mathcal{F}} is the Sormani-Wenger Intrinsic Flat distance. We present examples demonstrating the necessity of many of the hypotheses in our theorems.
