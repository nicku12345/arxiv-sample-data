Laurent Hauswirth and Harold Rosenberg developed the theory of minimal surfaces with finite total curvature in \H^2\times\R. They showed that the total curvature of one such a surface must be a non-negative integer multiple of -2\pi. The first examples appearing in this context are vertical geodesic planes and Scherk minimal graphs over ideal polygonal domains. Other non simply-connected examples have been constructed recently. In the present paper, we show that the only complete minimal surfaces in \H^2\times\R of total curvature -2\pi are Scherk minimal graphs over ideal quadrilaterals. We also construct properly embedded simply-connected minimal surfaces with total curvature -4k\pi, for any integer k\geq 1, which are not Scherk minimal graphs over ideal polygonal domains.
