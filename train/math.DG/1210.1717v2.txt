We establish the cancellation of the first 2j terms in the diagonal asymptotic expansion of the restriction to the (0,2j)-forms of the Bergman kernel associated to the spin{}^c Dirac operator on high tensor powers of a positive line bundle twisted by a (non necessarily holomorphic) complex vector bundle, over a compact K\"{a}hler manifold. Moreover, we give a local formula for the first and the second (non-zero) leading coefficients.
