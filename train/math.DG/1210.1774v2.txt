We recently established a Toponogov type triangle comparison theorem for a certain class of Finsler manifolds whose radial flag curvatures are bounded below by that of a von Mangoldt surface of revolution (arXiv:1205.3913). In this article, as its applications, we prove the finiteness of topological type and a diffeomorphism theorem to Euclidean spaces.
