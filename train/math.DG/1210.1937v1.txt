It is proved the non-existence of Hopf hypersurfaces in G_{2}({\Bbb C}^{m+2}), m \geq 3, whose normal Jacobi operator is semi-parallel, if the principal curvature of the Reeb vector field is non-vanishing and the component of the Reeb vector field in the maximal quaternionic subbundle {\frak D} or its orthogonal complement {\frak D}^{\bot} is invariant by the shape operator.
