We glue two manifolds which have curvature operators at least k (in the sense of eigenvalues) along their common boundary. We show that if the sum of the second fundamental forms of the boundary is positive semidefinite, then the curvature operator of the resulting manifold is at least k up to an arbitrarily small error term. Similar results hold for Ricci, scalar, bi, isotropic and flag curvature, respectively.
