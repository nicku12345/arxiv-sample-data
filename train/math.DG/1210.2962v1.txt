We apply the Cartan equivalence method to the study of real analytic second order ODEs under the local real analytic diffeomorphism of \C^2 which are area-preserving. This enables us to give a characterization of the second order ODEs which are equivalent to y^{\prime\prime}=0 under such transformations. Moreover we associate to certain of these second order ODEs which satisfy an invariant condition given by the vanishing of a relative differential invariant, an affine normal Cartan connection on the first jet space whose curvature contains all the area-preserving relative differential invariants.
