In 1970, Samuel I. Goldberg and Kentaro Yano defined the notion of noninvariant hypersurface of a Sasakian manifold [1]. In this paper we have studied the properties of parallel vector fields with respect to induced connection on the noninvariant hypersurface M of a Sasakian manifold \tilde M with (\phi, g, u, v, \lambda)- structure and proved that if the vector field V is parallel with respect to induced connection on M then M is totally geodesic.
