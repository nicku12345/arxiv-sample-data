The principal objective in this paer is to study the relationship between the old kingdom of differential geometry (the category of smooth manifolds) and its new kingdom (the category of functors on the category of Weil algebras to some smooth category). It is shown that the canonical embedding of the old kingdom into the new kingdom preserves Weil functors.
