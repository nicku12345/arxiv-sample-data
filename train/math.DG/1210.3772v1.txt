In this article, we prove a Kahler extension theorem for real Kahler submanifolds of codimension 4 and rank at least 5. Our main theorem states that such a manifold is a holomorphic hypersurface in another real Kahler submanifold of codimension 2. This generalizes a result of Dajczer and Gromoll in 1997 which states that any real Kahler submanifolds of codimension 3 and rank at least 4 admits a Kahler extension.
