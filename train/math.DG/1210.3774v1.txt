In 1991, Dajczer and Rodriguez proved in [10] that a complete minimal real Kahler submanifold of codimension 2, if with complex dimension > 2, would be either holomorphic, or a cylinder, or complex ruled. In this article, we generalize their result to real analytic complete real Kahler submanifolds of codimension 4. The conclusion is that such the submanifold, if with complex dimension > 4, would be either partially holomorphic, or a cylinder, or a twisted cylinder in the sense that the complex relative nullity foliation is contained in a strictly larger holomorphic foliation, whose leaves are cylinders. We also examine the question of when such a submanifold is complex ruled.
