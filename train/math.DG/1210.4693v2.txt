We construct a natural generalized complex structure on the total space of any bundle endowed with a Chern connection and whose typical fibre is a homogeneous symplectic manifold. This extends known constructions of generalized complex structures on Lie groups and leads to natural examples of holomorphic maps between generalized complex manifolds.
