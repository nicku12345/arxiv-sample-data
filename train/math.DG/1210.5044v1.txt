In this paper we have studied the properties of covariant almost analytic vector field on Q - quasi umbilical hypersurface M of a Sasakian manifold \tilde M with (\phi, g, u, v, \lambda)-structure and obtained the scalars \alpha and \beta using 1 - form u, v covariant almost analytic for the hypersurface M to be totally umbilical and cylindrical.
