In this paper, we prove that Euclidean hypersurfaces with almost extremal extrinsic radius or \lambda_1 have a spectrum that asymptotically contains the spectrum of the extremal sphere in the Reilly or Hasanis-Koutroufiotis Inequalities. We also consider almost extremal hypersurfaces which satisfy a supplementary bound on v_M\|\B\|_\alpha^n and show that their spectral and topological properties depends on the position of \alpha with respect to the critical value \dim M. The study of the metric shape of these extremal hypersurfaces will be done in \cite{AG1}, using estimates of the present paper.
