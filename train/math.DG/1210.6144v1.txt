We are studying a relationship between isoparametric hypersurfaces in spheres with four distinct principal curvatures and the moment maps of certain Hamiltonian actions. In this paper, we consider the isoparametric hypersurfaces obtained from the isotropy representations of compact irreducible Hermitian symmetric spaces of rank two. We prove that the Cartan-M\"unzner polynomials of these hypersurfaces can be written as squared-norms of the moment maps for some Hamiltonian actions. The proof is based on the structure theory of symmetric spaces.
