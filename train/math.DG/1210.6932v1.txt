A version of Lichnerowicz' theorem giving a lower bound of the eigenvalues of the sub-Laplacian under a lower bound on the Sp(1)Sp(1) component of the qc-Ricci curvature on a compact seven dimensional quaternionic contact manifold is established. It is shown that in the case of a seven dimensional compact 3-Sasakian manifold the lower bound is reached if and only if the quaternionic contact manifold is a round 3-Sasakian sphere.
