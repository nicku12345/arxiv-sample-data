We prove a version of Gauss-Bonnet theorem in sub-Riemannian Heisenberg space H^1. The sub-Riemannian distance makes H^1 a metric space and consenquently with a spherical Hausdorff measure. Using this measure, we define a Gaussian curvature at points of a surface S where the sub-Riemannian distribution is transverse to the tangent space of S. If all points of S have this property, we prove a Gauss-Bonnet formula and for compact surfaces (which are topologically a torus) we obtain \int_S K = 0.
