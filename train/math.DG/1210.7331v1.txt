We prove the following result: Let (\mathcal{O},g_0) be a complete, connected 3-orbifold with uniformly positive scalar curvature, with bounded geometry, and containing no bad 2-suborbifolds. Then there is a finite collection \mathcal{F} of spherical 3-orbifolds, such that \mathcal{O} is diffeomorphic to a (possibly infinite) orbifold connected sum of copies of members in \mathcal{F}. This extends work of Perelman and Bessi\grave{e}res-Besson-Maillot. The proof uses Ricci flow with surgery on complete 3-orbifolds, and are along the lines of the author's previous work on 4-orbifolds with positive isotropic curvature.
