In this paper we give a geometrically invariant spinorial representation of surfaces in four-dimensional space forms. In the Euclidean space, we obtain a representation formula which generalizes the Weierstrass representation formula of minimal surfaces. We also obtain as particular cases the spinorial characterizations of surfaces in \R^3 and in S^3 given by T. Friedrich and by B. Morel
