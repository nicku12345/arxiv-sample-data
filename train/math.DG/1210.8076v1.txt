Let (M,\bar{g}, e^{-f}d\mu) be a complete metric measure space with Bakry-\'Emery Ricci curvature bounded below by a positive constant. We prove that, in M, there is no complete two-sided L_f-stable immersed f-minimal hypersurface with finite weighted volume. Further, if M is a 3-manifold, we prove a smooth compactness theorem for the space of complete embedded f-minimal surfaces in M with the uniform upper bounds of genus and weighted volume, which generalizes the compactness theorem for complete self-shrinkers in \mathbb{R}^3 by Colding-Minicozzi.
