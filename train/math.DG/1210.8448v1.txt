Let \Omega be a bounded domain with convex boundary in a complete noncompact Riemannian manifold with Bakry-\'Emery Ricci curvature bounded below by a positive constant. We prove a lower bound of the first eigenvalue of the weighted Laplacian for closed embedded f-minimal hypersurfaces contained in \Omega. Using this estimate, we prove a compactness theorem for the space of closed embedded f-minimal surfaces with the uniform upper bounds of genus and diameter in a complete 3-manifold with Bakry-\'Emery Ricci curvature bounded below by a positive constant and admitting an exhaustion by bounded domains with convex boundary.
