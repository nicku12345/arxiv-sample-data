In trying to generalize Bianchi's B\"acklund transformation of quadrics to B\"acklund transformations of isometric deformations of other (classes of) surfaces, we investigate basic features of the isometric deformation of surfaces via the B\"acklund transformation with isometric correspondence of leaves of a general nature (independent of the shape of the seed).
