In this paper, we derive curvature estimates for strongly stable hypersurfaces with constant mean curvature immersed in \mathbb{R}^{n+1}, which show that the locally controlled volume growth yields a globally controlled volume growth if \partial M=\emptyset. Moreover, we deduce a Bernstein-type theorem for complete stable hypersurfaces with constant mean curvature of arbitrary dimension, given a finite L^p-norm curvature condition.
