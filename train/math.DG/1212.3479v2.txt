Under a nondegeneracy condition, we show that an equiregular sub-Riemannian manifold of step size r admits a canonical, V-rigid complement defined from the sub-Riemannian data that is preserved the by action of sub-Riemannian isometries. We explore how the existence of such a complement relates to results from the literature and study the step size 2 case in more detail.
