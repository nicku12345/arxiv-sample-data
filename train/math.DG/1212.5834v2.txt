We generalise a result of Garofalo and Pauls: a horizontally minimal smooth surface embedded in the Heisenberg group is locally a (straight) ruled surface, i.e. it consists of straight lines tangent to a horizontal vector field along a smooth curve. We show additionally that any horizontally minimal surface is locally contactomorphic to the complex plane.
