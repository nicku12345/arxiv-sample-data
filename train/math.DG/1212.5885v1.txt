Let Gr_k(\H^n) be the Grassmannian manifold of Quaternionic k-planes in \H^n and let \gamma^n_k\to Gr_k(\H^n) denote the Stiefel bundle of quaternionic k-frames in \H^n. Let \sigma denote the first symplectic Pontrjagin form associated with the universal connection on \gamma^n_k. We show that every 4-form \omega on a smooth manifold M can be induced from \sigma by a smooth immersion f:M\to Gr_k(\H^n) (for sufficiently large k and n) provided there exists a continuous map f_0:M\to Gr_k(\H^n) which pulls back the cohomology class of \sigma onto that of \omega.
