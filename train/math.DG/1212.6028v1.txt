In this paper, we study complete self-shrinkers in Euclidean space and prove that an n-dimensional complete self-shrinker with polynomial volume growth in Euclidean space \mathbb{R}^{n+1} is isometric to either \mathbb{R}^{n}, S^{n}(\sqrt{n}), or \mathbb{R}^{n-m}\times S^m (\sqrt{m}), 1\leq m\leq n-1, if the squared norm S of the second fundamental form is constant and satisfies S<(10/7).
