We introduce generalized almost contact structures which admit the B-field transformations on odd dimensional manifolds. We provide definition of generalized Sasakain structures from the view point of the generalized almost contact structures. We obtain a generalized Sasakian structure on a non-compact manifold which does not arise as a pair of ordinary Sasakian structures. However we show that a generalized Sasakian structure on compact 3-dimensional manifold is equivalent to a pair of Sasakian structures with the same metric. Finally we extend a definition of a generalized almost contact structure.
