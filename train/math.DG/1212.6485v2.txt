For a Riemannian manifold M^{n+1} and a compact domain \Omega \subset M^{n+1} bounded by a hypersurface \partial \Omega with normal curvature bounded below, estimates are obtained in terms of the distance from O to \partial \Omega for the angle between the geodesic line joining a fixed interior point O in \Omega to a point on \partial \Omega and the outward normal to the surface. Estimates for the width of a spherical shell containing such a hypersurface are also presented.
