We study fibrations \cV of toric varieties over the flag variety G/T, where G is a compact semisimple Lie group and T is a maximal torus. From symplectic data, we construct test configurations of \cV and compute their Futaki invariants by employing a generalization of Pick's Theorem. We also give a simple form of the Mabuchi Functional.
