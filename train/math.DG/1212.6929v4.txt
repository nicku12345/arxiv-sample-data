Let M be a complete Ricci-flat Kahler manifold with one end and assume that this end converges at an exponential rate to [0,\infty) \times X for some compact connected Ricci-flat manifold X. We begin by proving general structure theorems for M; in particular we show that there is no loss of generality in assuming that M is simply-connected and irreducible with Hol(M) = SU(n), where n is the complex dimension of M. If n > 2 we then show that there exists a projective orbifold \bar{M} and a divisor \bar{D} in |{-K_{\bar{M}}}| with torsion normal bundle such that M is biholomorphic to \bar{M}\setminus\bar{D}, thereby settling a long-standing question of Yau in the asymptotically cylindrical setting. We give examples where \bar{M} is not smooth: the existence of such examples appears not to have been noticed previously. Conversely, for any such pair (\bar{M}, \bar{D}) we give a short and self-contained proof of the existence and uniqueness of exponentially asymptotically cylindrical Calabi-Yau metrics on \bar{M}\setminus\bar{D}.
