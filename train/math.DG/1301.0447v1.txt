Isothermic surfaces in S^n are characterised by the existence of a pencil \nabla^t of flat connections. Such a surface is special of type d if there is a family p(t) of \nabla^t-parallel sections whose dependence on the spectral parameter t is polynomial of degree d. We prove that any isothermic surface admits a family of \nabla^t-parallel sections which is a formal Laurent series in t. As an application, we give conformally invariant conditions for an isothermic surface in S^3 to be special.
