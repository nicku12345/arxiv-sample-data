A normal field on a spacelike surface in R^4_1 is called bi-normal if K^{\nu}, the determinant of Weingarten map associated with \nu, is zero. In this paper we give a relationship between the spacelike pseudo-planar surfaces and spacelike pseudo-umbilical surfaces, then study the bi-normal fields on spacelike ruled surfaces and spacelike surfaces of revolution.
