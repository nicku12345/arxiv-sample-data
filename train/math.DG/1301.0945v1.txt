Let (B^n, g) the n-dimensional Ball. In this paper we show the existence of a solution to the prescribing mean curvature equation:   In the case h is rotationally symetric, is well known that the Kazdan-Warner condition implies that a necesary condition for \eqref{main} to have a solution is: h>0 \text{somewhere and}h'(r) \text{change signs}   This condition was improved to: {eqnarray}\label{dos} h'(r) \text{changes signs where} h>0 {eqnarray} However, is this a sufficient condition?. In this paper we prove that if h(r) satisfies a flatness condition and is radially symmetric then \eqref{dos} is the necessary and suficient condition to have a solution on the subcritical level.
