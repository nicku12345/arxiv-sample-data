We study the provenance of singularity formation under mean curvature flow and volume preserving mean curvature flow in an axially symmetric setting. We prove that if the mean curvature is uniformly bounded on any finite time interval, then no singularities can develop during that time under both mean curvature flow and volume preserving mean curvature flow.
