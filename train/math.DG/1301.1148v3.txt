The aim of this paper is to obtain the fundamental tone for minimal submanifolds of the Euclidean or hyperbolic space under certain restrictions on the extrinsic curvature. We show some sufficient conditions on the norm of the second fundamental form that allow us to obtain the same upper and lower bound for the fundamental tone of minimal submanifolds in a Cartan-Hadamard ambient manifold. As an intrinsic result, we obtain a sufficient condition on the volume growth of a Cartan-Hadamard manifold to achieve the lowest bound for the fundamental tone given by McKean.
