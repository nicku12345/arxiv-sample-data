We introduce on any smooth oriented minimal surface in Euclidean 3-space a meromorphic quadratic differential, P, which we call the entropy differential. This differential arises naturally in a number of different contexts. Of particular interest is the realization of its real part as a conservation law for a natural geometric functional -- which is, essentially, the entropy of the Gauss curvature. We characterize several classical surfaces -- including Enneper's surface, the catenoid and the helicoid -- in terms of P. As an application, we prove a novel curvature estimate for embedded minimal surfaces with small entropy differential and an associated compactness theorem.
