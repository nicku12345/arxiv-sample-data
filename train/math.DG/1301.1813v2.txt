Let (M,F) be a connected Finsler space. An isometry of (M,F) is called a Clifford-Wolf translation (or simply CW-translation) if it moves all points the same distance. The compact Finsler space (M,F) is called restrictively Clifford-Wolf homogeneous (restrictively CW-homogeneous) if for any two sufficiently close points x_1,x_2\in M, there exists a CW-translation \sigma such that \sigma(x_1)=x_2. In this paper, we define the good normalized datum for a homogeneous non-Riemannian (\alpha,\beta)-space, and use it to study the restrictive CW-homogeneity of left invariant (\alpha,\beta)-metrics on a compact connected semisimple Lie group. We prove that a left invariant restrictively CW-homogeneous (\alpha,\beta)-metric on a compact semisimple Lie group must be of the Randers type. This gives a complete classification of left invariant (\alpha,\beta)-metrics on compact semi-simple Lie groups which are restrictively Clifford-Wolf homogeneous.
