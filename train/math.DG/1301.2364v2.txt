The Hessian Topology is a subject with interesting relations with some classical problems of analysis and geometry. In this article we prove a conjecture on this subject stated by V.I. Arnold concerning the number of connected components of hyperbolic homogeneous polynomials of degree n. The proof is constructive and provides models. Our approach uses index properties at isolated singularities of hyperbolic quadratic differential forms and combinatorial properties of recurrent functions.
