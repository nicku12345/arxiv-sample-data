In this paper, the notion of an almost contact K\"ahlerian structure is introduced. The interior geometry of almost contact K\"ahlerian spaces is investigated. On the zero-curvature distribution of an almost contact metric structure, as on the total space of a vector bundle, an almost contact K\"ahlerian structure is obtained.
