In this paper we obtain natural boundary conditions for a large class of variational problems with free boundary values. In comparison with the already existing examples, our framework displays complete freedom concerning the topology of Y, the manifold of dependent and independent variables underlying a given problem, as well as the order of its Lagrangian. Our result follows from the natural behavior, under boundary-friendly transformations, of an operator, similar to the Euler map, constructed in the context of relative horizontal forms on jet bundles (or Grassmann fibrations) over Y. Explicit examples of natural boundary conditions are obtained when Y is an (n+1)--dimensional domain in \R^{n+1}, and the Lagrangian is first-order (in particular, the hypersurface area).
