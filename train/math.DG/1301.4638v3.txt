It is a classical fact that the cotangent bundle T^* \M of a differentiable manifold \M enjoys a canonical symplectic form \Omega^*. If (\M,\j,g,\omega) is a pseudo-K\"ahler or para-K\"ahler 2n-dimensional manifold, we prove that the tangent bundle T\M also enjoys a natural pseudo-K\"ahler or para-K\"ahler structure (\J,\G,\Omega), where \Omega is the pull-back by g of \Omega^* and \G is a pseudo-Riemannian metric with neutral signature (2n,2n). We investigate the curvature properties of the pair (\J,\G) and prove that: \G is scalar-flat, is not Einstein unless g is flat, has nonpositive (resp.\ nonnegative) Ricci curvature if and only if g has nonpositive (resp.\ nonnegative) Ricci curvature as well, and is locally conformally flat if and only if n=1 and g has constant curvature, or n>2 and g is flat. We also check that (i) the holomorphic sectional curvature of (\J,\G) is not constant unless g is flat, and (ii) in n=1 case, that \G is never anti-self-dual, unless conformally flat.
