We show that the explicit ALE Ricci-flat Kahler metrics constructed by Eguchi-Hanson, Gibbons-Hawking, Hitchin and Kronheimer, and their free quotients are metrics obtained by Tian-Yau techniques. The proof relies on a construction of good compactifications of Q-Gorenstein deformations of quotient surface singularities as log del Pezzo surfaces with only cyclic quotient singularities at infinity.
