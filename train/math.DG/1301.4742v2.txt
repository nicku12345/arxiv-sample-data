A submanifold in space forms satisfies the well-known DDVV inequality due to De Smet, Dillen, Verstraelen and Vrancken. The submanifold attaining equality in the DDVV inequality at every point is called Wintgen ideal submanifold. As conformal invariant objects, Wintgen ideal submanifolds are studied in this paper using the framework of M\"{o}bius geometry. We classify Wintgen ideal submanfiolds of dimension m>2 and arbitrary codimension when a canonically defined 2-dimensional distribution \mathbb{D} is integrable. Such examples come from cones, cylinders, or rotational submanifolds over super-minimal surfaces in spheres, Euclidean spaces, or hyperbolic spaces, respectively.
