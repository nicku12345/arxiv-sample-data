Let (M_1,g_1) and (M_2,g_2) be two C^\infty--differentiable connected, complete Riemannian manifolds, k:M_1\to\mathbb R a C^\infty--differentiable function, having 0<k_0<k(x)\leq K_0, for any x\in M_1 and g:=g_1-kg_2 the semi Riemannian metric on the product manifold M:=M_1\times M_2. We associate to g a suitable family of Riemannian metrics G_r+g_2, with r>-K_0^{-1}, on M and we call Riemannian geodesics of g the geodesics of g which are geodesics of a metric of the previous family, via a suitable reparametrization. Among the properties of these geodesics, we quote: For any z_0=(x_0,y_0)\in M and for any y_1\in M_2 there exists a subset A of M_1, such that all the geodesics of g joining z_0 with a point (x_1,y_1), with x_1\in A, are Riemannian. The Riemannian geodesics of g determine a "partial" property of geodesic connection on M. Finally, we determine two new classes of semi Riemannian metrics (one of which includes some FLRM-metrics), geodesically connected by Riemannian geodesics of g.
