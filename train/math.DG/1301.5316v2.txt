In this paper we study some problems related to a vertical Liouville distribution (called vertical Liouville-Hamilton distribution) on the cotangent bundle of a Cartan space. We study the existence of some linear connections of Vr\u{a}nceanu type on Cartan spaces related to some foliated structures. Also, we identify a certain (n,2n-1)--codimensional subfoliation (\mathcal{F}_V,\mathcal{F}_{C^*}) on T^*M_0 given by vertical foliation \mathcal{F}_V and the line foliation \mathcal{F}_{C^*} spanned by the vertical Liouville-Hamilton vector field C^* and we give a triplet of basic connections adapted to this subfoliation. Finally, using the vertical Liouville foliation \mathcal{F}_{V_{C^*}} and the natural almost complex structure on T^*M_0 we study some aspects concerning the cohomology of c--indicatrix cotangent bundle.
