Motivated by the definition of the smooth manifold structure on a suitable mapping space, we consider the general problem of how to transfer local properties from a smooth space to an associated mapping space. This leads to the notion of smoothly local properties.   In realising the definition of a local property at a particular point it may be that there are choices that need to be made. To say that the local property is smoothly local is to say that those choices can be made smoothly dependent on the point. In particular, that a manifold has charts is a local property. A local addition is the structure needed to say that there is a way to choose a chart about each point so that it varies smoothly with that point.   To be able to extend these ideas beyond that of the local additivity of manifolds we work in a category of generalised smooth spaces. We are thus are able to consider more general mapping spaces than just those arising from the maps from one smooth manifold to another and thus able to generalise the standard result on when this space of maps is again a smooth manifold.   As applications of this generalisation we show that the mapping spaces involving the various figure 8s from String Topology are manifolds, and that they embed as submanifolds with tubular neighbourhoods in the corresponding loop spaces. We also show that applying the mapping space functor to a regular map of manifolds produces a regular map on the mapping spaces.
