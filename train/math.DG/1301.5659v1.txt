This article examines the coincidence of the projective and conformal Weyl tensors associated to a given connection D. The connection may be a general Weyl connection associated to a conformal class of metrics [g]. The main result for n>3 is that the Weyl tensors coincide iff D is the Levi-Civita connection of an Einstein metric.
