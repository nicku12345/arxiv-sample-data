We continue our investigations into Toda's algorithm [14,3]; a Weierstrass-type representation of Gauss curvature K=-1 surfaces in \mathbb{R}^3. We show that C^0 input potentials correspond in an appealing way to a special new class of surfaces, with K=-1, which we call C^{1M}. These are surfaces which may not be C^2, but whose mixed second partials are continuous and equal. We also extend several results of Hartman-Wintner [5] concerning special coordinate changes which increase differentiability of immersions of K=-1 surfaces. We prove a C^{1M} version of Hilbert's Theorem.
