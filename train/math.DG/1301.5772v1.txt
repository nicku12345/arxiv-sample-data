In this paper we study lightlike surfaces of Minkowski 3- space such that they have degenerate or non-degenerate planar normal sections. We first show that every lightlike surface of Minkowski 3- space has degenerate planar normal sections. Then we study lightlike surfaces with non-degenerate planar normal sections and obtain a characterization for such lightlike surfaces.
