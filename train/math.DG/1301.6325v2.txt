For a surface in the 3-dimensional real projective space, we define a Gauss map, which is a quadric in \mathbb R^{4} and called the first-order Gauss map. It will be shown that the surface is a Demoulin surface if and only if the first-order Gauss map is conformal, and the surface is a projective minimal coincidence surface or a Demoulin surface if and only if the first-order Gauss map is harmonic. Moreover for a Demoulin surface, it will be shown that the first-order Gauss map can be obtained by the natural projection of the Lorentz primitive map into a 6-symmetric space. We also characterize Demoulin surfaces via a family of flat connections on the trivial bundle \D \times \SL over a simply connected domain \mathbb{D} in the Euclidean 2-plane.
