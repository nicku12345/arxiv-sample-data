We prove the existence of extremal, non-csc, K\"ahler metrics on certain unstable projectivised vector bundles \P (E) \to M over a cscK-manifold M with discrete holomorphic automorphism group, in certain adiabatic K\"ahler classes. In particular, the vector bundles E \to M under consideration are assumed to split as a direct sum of stable subbundles E=E_1 \oplus \dots \oplus E_s all having different Mumford-Takemoto-slope, e.g. \mu(E_1) > \dots > \mu(E_s).
