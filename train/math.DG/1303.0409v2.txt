We prove a quaternionic contact versions of the Obata's sphere theorems. We show that if the first positive eigenvalue of the sub-Laplacian on a compact qc manifold of dimension bigger than seven takes the smallest possible value then, up to a homothety of the qc structure, the manifold is qc equivalent to the standard 3-Sasakian sphere. We also give a version of the theorem on non-compact qc manifold which is complete with respect to the associated Riemannian metric using the existence of a function with traceless horizontal Hessian. A qc version of the Liouville theorem is shown for qc-conformal maps between open connected sets of the 3-Sasakian sphere.
