In this paper we develop the geometry of bounded Fr\'echet manifolds. We prove that a bounded Fr\'echet tangent bundle admits a vector bundle structure. But the second order tangent bundle T^2M of a bounded Fr\'echet manifold M, becomes a vector bundle over M if and only if M is endowed with a linear connection. As an application, we prove the existence and uniqueness of the integral curve of a vector field on M.
