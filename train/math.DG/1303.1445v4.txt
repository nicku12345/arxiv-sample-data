In this paper we consider two special classes of constrained Willmore tori in the 3-sphere. The first class is given by the rotation of closed elastic curves in the upper half plane - viewed as the hyperbolic plane - around the x-axis. The second is given as the preimage of closed constrained elastic curves, i.e., elastic curve with enclosed area constraint, in the round 2-sphere under the Hopf fibration. We show that all conformal types can be isometrically immersed into S^3 as constrained Willmore (Hopf) tori and write down all constrained elastic curves in H^2 and S^2 in terms of the Weierstrass elliptic functions. Further, we determine the closing condition for the curves and compute the Willmore energy and the conformal type of the resulting tori.
