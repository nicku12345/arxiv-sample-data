We show that if \Gamma is an irreducible subgroup of {\rm SU}(2,1), then \Gamma contains a loxodromic element A. If A has eigenvalues \lambda_1 = \lambda e^{i\varphi}, \lambda_2 = e^{-2i\varphi}, \lambda_3 = \lambda^{-1}e^{i\varphi}, we prove that \Gamma is conjugate in {\rm SU}(2,1) to a subgroup of {\rm SU}(2,1,\mathbb{Q}(\Gamma,\lambda)), where \mathbb{Q}(\Gamma, \lambda) is the field generated by the trace field \mathbb{Q}(\Gamma) of \Gamma and \lambda. It follows from this that if \Gamma is an irreducible subgroup of {\rm SU}(2,1) such that the trace field \mathbb{Q}(\Gamma) is real, then \Gamma is conjugate in {\rm SU}(2,1) to a subgroup of {\rm SO}(2,1). As a geometric application of the above, we get that if G is an irreducible discrete subgroup of {\rm PU}(2,1), then G is an \mathbb{R}-Fuchsian subgroup of {\rm PU}(2,1) if and only if the invariant trace field k(G) of G is real.
