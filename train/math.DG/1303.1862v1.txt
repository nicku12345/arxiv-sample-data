Following Burstall and Hertrich-Jeromin we study the Ribaucour transformation of Legendre submanifolds in Lie sphere geometry. We give an explicit parametrization of the resulted Legendre submanifold \hat{F} of a Ribaucour transformation, via a single real function \tau which represents the regular Ribaucour sphere congruence s enveloped by the original Legendre submanifold F.
