Parabolic structures with rational weights encode certain iterated blowups of geometrically ruled surfaces. In this paper, we show that the three notions of parabolic polystability, K-polystability and existence of constant scalar curvature K\"ahler metrics on the iterated blowup are equivalent, for certain polarizations close to the boundary of the K\"ahler cone.
