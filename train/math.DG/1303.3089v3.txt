We study the existence and uniqueness problem of compact minimal vertical graphs in \mathbb{H}^n\times\mathbb{R}, n\geq 2, over bounded domains in the slice \mathbb{H}^n\times\{0\}, with non-connected boundary having a finite number of C^0 hypersufaces homeomorphic to the sphere \mathbb{S}^{n-1}, with prescribed bounded continuous boundary data, under hypotheses relating those data and the geometry of the boundary. We show the nonexistence of compact minimal vertical graphs in \mathbb{H}^n\times\mathbb{R} having the boundary in two slices and the height greater than or equal to \pi/(2n-2).
