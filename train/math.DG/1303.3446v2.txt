Let (M^n,g,\nabla f), n\geq 3, be an expanding gradient Ricci soliton with nonnegative sectional curvature whose asymptotic cone is isometric to C(\mathbb{S}^{n-1}(c)) where \mathbb{S}^{n-1}(c) is the standard (n-1)-sphere of curvature 1/c^2, with c\in(0,1). We prove that if the convergence to the asymptotic cone is smooth, (M^n,g,\nabla f) is rotationally symmetric. This is the expanding analogue of the Perelman conjecture on the Bryant soliton and this work is based on the proof by Brendle \cite{Bre-Rot-3d}. This has also been proved recently by Chodosh \cite{Cho-EGS}.
