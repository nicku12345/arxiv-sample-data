In this paper, we prove a half-space theorem with respect to constant mean curvature 1/2 entire graphs in \mathbb{E(-1,\tau)}. If \Sigma is such an entire graph and \Sigma' is a properly immersed constant mean curvature 1/2 surface included in the mean convex side of \Sigma then \Sigma' is a vertical translate of \Sigma. We also have an equivalent statement for the non mean convex side of \Sigma.
