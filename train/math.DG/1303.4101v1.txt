We prove spectral, stochastic and mean curvature estimates for complete m-submanifolds \varphi \colon M \to N of n-manifolds with a pole N in terms of the comparison isoperimetric ratio I_{m} and the extrinsic radius r_\varphi\leq \infty. Our proof holds for the bounded case r_\varphi< \infty, recovering the known results, as well as for the unbounded case r_{\varphi}=\infty. In both cases, the fundamental ingredient in these estimates is the integrability over (0, r_\varphi) of the inverse I_{m}^{-1} of the comparison isoperimetric radius. When r_{\varphi}=\infty, this condition is guaranteed if N is highly negatively curved.
