Given a non-compact, simply connected homogeneous three-manifold X and a sequence \{\Omega_n\}_n of isoperimetric domains in X with volumes tending to infinity, we prove that as n\to \infty : 1. The radii of the \Omega_n tend to infinity. 2. The ratios \{Area} (\partial \Omega_n)/\{Vol}(\Omega_n) converge to the Cheeger constant Ch(X), which we also prove to be equal to 2H(X) where H(X) is the critical mean curvature of X. 3. The values of the constant mean curvatures H_n of the boundary surfaces \partial \Omega_n converge to \frac{1}{2}\{Ch}(X). Furthermore, when Ch(X) is positive, we prove that for n large, \partial \Omega_n is well-approximated in a natural sense by the leaves of a certain foliation of X, where every leaf of the foliation is a surface of constant mean curvature H(X).
