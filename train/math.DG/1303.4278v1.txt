In this paper, a correspondence via duality is established between the set of locally strongly convex symmetric equiaffine hyperspheres and the set of minimal symmetric Lagrangian submanifolds in a certain complex space form. By using this correspondence theorem, we are able to provide an alternative proof of the classification theorem for the locally strongly convex equiaffine hypersurfaces with parallel Fubini-Pick forms, which has been established recently by Z.J. Hu etc in a totally different way.
