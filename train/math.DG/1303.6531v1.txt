We give a simple criterion for a pointwise curvature condition to be stable under surgery. Namely, a curvature condition C, which is understood to be an open, convex, O(n)-invariant cone in the space of algebraic curvature operators, is stable under surgeries of codimension at least c provided it contains the curvature operator corresponding to S^{c-1} \times \reals^{n-c+1}, c \geq 3.   This is used to generalize the well-known classification result of positive scalar curvature in the simply-connected case in the following way: Any simply-connected manifold M^n, n \geq 5, which is either spin with vanishing \alpha-invariant or else is non-spin admits for any \epsilon > 0 a metric such that the curvature operator satisfies R > - \epsilon \norm{R}.
