In this note, we complete the classification of the geometry of non-compact two-dimensional gradient Ricci solitons. As a consequence, we obtain two corollaries: First, a complete two-dimensional gradient Ricci soliton has bounded curvature. Second, we give examples of complete two-dimensional expanding Ricci solitons with negative curvature that are topologically disks and are not hyperbolic space.
