We show that a harmonic map from a Riemann surface into the exceptional symmetric space G_2/{\mathrm SO}(4) has a J_2-holomorphic twistor lift into one of the three flag manifolds of G_2 if and only if it is `nilconformal', i.e., has nilpotent derivative. Then we find relationships with almost complex maps from a surface into the 6-sphere; this enables us to construct examples of nilconformal harmonic maps into G_2/{\mathrm SO}(4) which are not of finite uniton number, and which have lifts into any of the three twistor spaces. Harmonic maps of finite uniton number are all nilconformal; for such maps, we show that our lifts can be constructed explicitly from extended solutions.
