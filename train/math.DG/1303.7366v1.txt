Let U \subset \mathbb A^n be an open subset of real affine space. We consider functions F: U \to \mathbb R with non-degenerate Hessian such that the first or the third derivative of F is parallel with respect to the Levi-Civita connection defined by the Hessian metric F". In the former case the solutions are given precisely by the logarithmically homogeneous functions, while the latter case is closely linked to metrised Jordan algebras. Both conditions together are related to unital metrised Jordan algebras. Both conditions combined with convexity provide a local characterization of canonical barriers on symmetric cones.
