In this paper, we analyze the problem of constructing a surface pencil from a given spacelike (timelike) line of curvature. By using the Frenet frame of the given curve in Minkowski 3-space, we express the surface pencil as a linear combination of this frame and derive the necessary and sufficient conditions for the coefficients to satisfy the line of curvature requirement. To illustrate the method some examples showing members of the surface pencil with their line of curvature are given.
