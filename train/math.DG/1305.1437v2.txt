We introduce a new volume definition on normed vector spaces. We show that the induced k-area functionals are convex for all k. In the particular case k=2, our theorem implies that Busemann's 2-volume density is convex, which was recently shown by Burago-Ivanov. We also show how the new volume definition is related to the centroid body and prove some affine isoperimetric inequalities.
