Let (\Sigma_1,g_1) and (\Sigma_2,g_2) be connected, complete and orientable Riemannian two manifolds. Consider the two canonical K\"ahler structures (G^{\epsilon},J,\Omega^{\epsilon}) on the product 4-manifold \Sigma_1\times\Sigma_2 given by  G^{\epsilon}=g_1\oplus \epsilon g_2, \epsilon=\pm 1 and J is the canonical product complex structure. Thus for \epsilon=1 the K\"ahler metric G^+ is Riemannian while for \epsilon=-1, G^- is of neutral signature. We show that the metric G^{\epsilon} is locally conformally flat iff the Gauss curvatures \kappa(g_1) and \kappa(g_2) are both constants satisfying \kappa(g_1)=-\epsilon\kappa(g_2). We also give conditions on the Gauss curvatures for which every G^{\epsilon}-minimal Lagrangian surface is the product \gamma_1\times\gamma_2\subset\Sigma_1\times\Sigma_2, where \gamma_1 and \gamma_2 are geodesics of (\Sigma_1,g_1) and (\Sigma_2,g_2), respectively. Finally, we explore the Hamiltonian stability of projected rank one Hamiltonian G^{\epsilon}-minimal surfaces.
