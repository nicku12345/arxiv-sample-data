Given a piecewise linear (PL) function p defined on an open subset of \R^n, one may construct by elementary means a unique polyhedron with multiplicities \D(p) in the cotangent bundle \R^n\times \R^{n*} representing the graph of the differential of p. Restricting to dimension 2, we show that any smooth function f(x,y) may be approximated by a sequence p_1,p_2,\dots of PL functions such that the areas of the \D(p_i) are locally dominated by the area of the graph of df times a universal constant.
