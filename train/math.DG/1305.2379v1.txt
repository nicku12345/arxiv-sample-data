We derive the Simons' type equation for f-minimal hypersurfaces in weighted Riemannian manifolds and apply it to obtain a pinching theorem for closed f-minimal hypersurfaces immersed in the product manifold \mathbb{S}^n(\sqrt{2(n-1)})\times \mathbb{R} with f=\frac {t^2}{4}. Also we classify closed f-minimal hypersurfaces with L_f-index one immersed in \mathbb{S}^n(\sqrt{2(n-1)})\times \mathbb{R} with the same f as above.
