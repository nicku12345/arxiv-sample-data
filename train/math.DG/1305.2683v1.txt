Using the navigation data (h,W) of a Kropina space, we characterize weakly-Berwald Kropina spaces and Berwald Kropina spaces by means of the Killing vector field W and the parallel vector field W, respectively. Moreover, the local 1-parameter group of Finslerian local isometries of the Kropina space coincides with the local 1-parameter group Riemannian of local isometries on (M, h).
