Coassociative submanifolds are 4-dimensional calibrated submanifolds in G_{2}-manifolds. In this paper, we construct explicit examples of coassociative submanifolds in \Lambda^{2}_{-} S^{4}, which is the complete G_{2}-manifold constructed by Bryant and Salamon. Classifying the Lie groups which have 3- or 4-dimensional orbits, we show that the only homogeneous coassociative submanifold is the zero section of \Lambda^{2}_{-} S^{4} up to the automorphisms and construct many cohomogeneity one examples explicitly. In particular, we obtain examples of non-compact coassociative submanifolds with conical singularities and their desingularizations.
