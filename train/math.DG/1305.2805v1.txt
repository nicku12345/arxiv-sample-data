This paper gives a new characterization of geodesic spheres in the hyperbolic space in terms of a ``weighted'' higher order mean curvature. Precisely, we show that a compact hypersurface \Sigma^{n-1} embedded in \H^n with VH_k being constant for some k=1,\cdots,n-1 is a centered geodesic sphere. Here H_k is the k-th normalized mean curvature of \Sigma induced from \H^n and V=\cosh r, where r is a hyperbolic distance to a fixed point in \H^n. Moreover, this result can be generalized to a compact hypersurface \Sigma embedded in \H^n with the ratio V\left(\frac{H_k}{H_j}\right)\equiv\mbox{constant},\;0\leq j< k\leq n-1 and H_j not vanishing on \Sigma.
