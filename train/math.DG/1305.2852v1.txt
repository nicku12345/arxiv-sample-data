Let (M,\omega) be a symplectic manifold and F be a Finsler structure on M. In the present paper we define a lift of the symplectic two-form \omega on the manifold TM\backslash 0, and find the conditions that the Chern connection of the Finsler structure F preserves this lift of \omega. In this situation if M admits a nowhere zero vector field then we have a non-empty family of Fedosov structures on M.
