We introduce the new class of submanifolds of co-Banach type in tame Fr\'echet manifolds and construct tame Fr\'echet submanifolds as inverse images of regular values of certain tame maps. Our method furnishes an easy way to construct tame Fr\'echet manifolds. The results presented are key ingredients in the construction of affine Kac-Moody symmetric spaces; they have also important applications in the study of isoparametric submanifolds in tame Fr\'echet spaces.
