Submanifolds of coordinate finite-type were introduced in HV1. A submanifold of a Euclidean space is called a coordinate finite-type submanifold if its coordinate functions are eigenfunctions of {\Delta}. In the present study we consider coordinate finite-type surfaces in E^4. We give necessary and sufficient conditions for generalized rotation surfaces in E^4 to become coordinate finite-type. We also give some special examples.
