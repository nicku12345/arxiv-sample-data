Let X be a differentiable manifold endowed with a transitive action \alpha:A\times X\longrightarrow X of a Lie group A. Let K be a Lie group. Under suitable technical assumptions, we give explicit classification theorems, in terms of explicit finite dimensional quotients, of three classes of objects: {enumerate} equivalence classes of \alpha-invariant K-connections on X,   \alpha-invariant gauge classes of K-connections on X, and   \alpha-invariant isomorphism classes of pairs (Q,P) consisting of a holomorphic K^\C-bundle Q\longrightarrow X and a K-reduction P of Q (when X has an \alpha-invariant complex structure). {enumerate}
