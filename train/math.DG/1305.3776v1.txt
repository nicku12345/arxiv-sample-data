In the present paper a generalized K\"ahlerian space \mathbb{G}\underset 1 {\mathbb{K}}{}_N of the first kind is considered, as a generalized Riemannian space \mathbb{GR}_N with almost complex structure F^h_i, that is covariantly constant with respect to the first kind of covariant derivative.   Using the non-symmetric metric tensor we find necessary and sufficient conditions for a geodesic mapping f:\mathbb{GR}_N\to \mathbb{G}\underset 1 {\mathbb{\bar{K}}}{}_N with respect to the four kinds of covariant derivatives.
