I In this paper, first we study a complete smooth metric measure space (M^n,g, e^{-f}dv) with the (\infty)-Bakry-\'Emery Ricci curvature \textrm{Ric}_f\ge \frac a2g for some positive constant a. It is known that the spectrum of the drifted Laplacian \Delta_f for M is discrete and the first nonzero eigenvalue of \Delta_f has lower bound \frac a2. We prove that if the lower bound \frac a2 is achieved with multiplicity k\geq 1, then k\leq n, M is isometric to \Sigma^{n-k}\times \mathbb{R}^k for some complete (n-k)-dimensional manifold \Sigma and by passing an isometry, (M^n,g, e^{-f}dv) must split off a gradient shrinking Ricci soliton (\mathbb{R}^k, g_{can}, \frac{a}{4}|t|^2), t\in \mathbb{R}^k. This result has an application to gradient shrinking Ricci solitons. Secondly, we study the drifted Laplacian \mathcal{L} for properly immersed self-shrinkers in the Euclidean space \mathbb{R}^{n+p}, p\geq1 and show the discreteness of the spectrum of \mathcal{L} and a logarithmic Sobolev inequality.
