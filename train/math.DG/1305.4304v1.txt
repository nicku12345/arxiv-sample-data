We give necessary and sufficient conditions for warped product manifolds with 1-dimensional base, and in particular, for generalized Robertson-Walker spacetimes, to satisfy some generalized Einstein metric condition. We also construct suitable examples of such manifolds. They are quasi-Einstein or not.
