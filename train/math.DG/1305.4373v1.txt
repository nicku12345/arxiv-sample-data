A depth surface of E^3 is a range image observed from a single view can be represented by a digital graph (Monge patch) surface . That is, a depth or range value at a point (u,v) is given by a single valued function z=f(u,v). In the present study we consider the surfaces in Euclidean 4-space E^4 given with a Monge patch z=f(u,v),w=g(u,v). We investigated the curvature properties of these surfaces. We also give some special examples of these surfaces which are first defined by Yu. Aminov. Finally, we proved that every Aminov surface is a non-trivial Chen surface.
