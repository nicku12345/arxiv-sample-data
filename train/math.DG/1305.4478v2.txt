Let M be an n-dimensional differentiable manifold with a symmetric connection \nabla  and T^{\ast}M be its cotangent bundle. In this paper, we study some properties of the modified Riemannian extension % \widetilde{g}_{\nabla,c} on T^{\ast}M defined by means of a symmetric % (0,2)-tensor field c on M. We get the conditions under which T^{\ast}M  endowed with the horizontal lift ^{H}J of an almost complex structure J and with the metric \widetilde{g}_{\nabla,c} is a K\"{a}hler-Norden manifold. Also curvature properties of the Levi-Civita connection and another metric connection of the metric \widetilde{g}_{\nabla,c} are presented.
