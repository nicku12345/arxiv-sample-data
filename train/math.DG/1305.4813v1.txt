In this paper we develop the theory of properly immersed minimal surfaces in the quotient space \mathbb H^2\times\mathbb R/G, where G is a subgroup of isometries generated by a vertical translation and a horizontal isometry in \mathbb H^2 without fixed points. The horizontal isometry can be either a parabolic translation along horocycles in \mathbb H^2 or a hyperbolic translation along a geodesic in \mathbb H^2. In fact, we prove that if a properly immersed minimal surface in \mathbb H^2\times\mathbb R/G has finite total curvature then its total curvature is a multiple of 2\pi, and moreover, we understand the geometry of the ends. These theorems hold true more generally for properly immersed minimal surfaces in M\times\mathbb S^1, where M is a hyperbolic surface with finite topology whose ends are isometric to one of the ends of the above spaces \mathbb H^2\times\mathbb R/G.
