Conformally quasi-recurrent (CQR)_n pseudo-Riemannian manifolds are investigated, and several new results are obtained. It is shown that the Ricci tensor and the gradient of the fundamental vector are Weyl compatible tensors (the notion was introduced recently by the authors and applies to significative space-times), (CQR)_n manifolds with concircular fundamental vector are quasi-Einstein. For 4-dimensional (CQR)_4 Lorentzian manifolds the fundamental vector is null and unique up to a scaling, it is an eigenvector of the Ricci tensor, and its integral curves are geodesics. Such space-times are Petrov type-N with respect to the fundamental null vector.
