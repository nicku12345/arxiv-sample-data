The Schouten tensor \ A \ of a Riemannian manifold \ (M,g) provides important scalar curvature invariants \sigma_k, that are the symmetric functions on the eigenvalues of A, where, in particular, \sigma_1 \ coincides with the standard scalar curvature \ \Scal(g). Our goal here is to study compact manifolds with positive \ \Gamma_2-curvature, \ i.e., when \sigma_1(g)>0 and \sigma_2(g)>0. In particular, we prove that a 3-connected non-string manifold M admits a positive\Gamma_2-curvature metric if and only if it admits a positive scalar curvature metric. Also we show that any finitely presented group \pi can always be realised as the fundamental group of a closed manifold of positive \Gamma_2-curvature and of arbitrary dimension greater than or equal to six.
