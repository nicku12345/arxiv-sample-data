In this work we firstly classify space-like surfaces in Minkowski space \mathbb E^4_1, de-Sitter space \mathbb S^3_1 and hyperbolic space \mathbb H^3 with harmonic Gauss map. Then we give a characterization and classification of space-like surfaces with pointwise 1-type Gauss map of the first kind. We also give some explicit examples.
