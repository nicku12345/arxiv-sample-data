We will prove that \emph{there are no stable complete hypersurfaces of \mathbb{R}^4 with zero scalar curvature, polynomial volume growth and such that \dfrac{(-K)}{H^3}\geq c>0 everywhere, for some constant c>0}, where K denotes the Gauss-Kronecker curvature and H denotes the mean curvature of the immersion. Our second result is the Bernstein type one \emph{there is no entire graphs of \mathbb{R}^4 with zero scalar curvature such that \dfrac{(-K)}{H^3}\geq c>0 everywhere}. At last, it will be proved that, if there exists a stable hypersurface with zero scalar curvature and \dfrac{(-K)}{H^3}\geq c>0 everywhere, that is, with volume growth greater than polynomial, then its tubular neighborhood is not embedded for suitable radius.
