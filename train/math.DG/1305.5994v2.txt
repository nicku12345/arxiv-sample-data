In the present paper we study naturally reductive homogeneous (\alpha,\beta)-metric spaces. Under some conditions, we give some necessary and sufficient conditions for a homogeneous (\alpha,\beta)-metric space to be naturally reductive. Then we show that for such spaces the two definitions of naturally reductive homogeneous Finsler space, given in literature, are equivalent. Finally we compute the flag curvature of naturally reductive homogeneous (\alpha,\beta)-metric spaces.
