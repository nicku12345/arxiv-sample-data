Let F^{2n}=(M,M',F^{\ast}) be an even-dimensional pseudo-Finsler manifold. We construct an almost hypercomplex structure on any chart domain of a certain atlas of M' by using a considered non-linear connection. Then by using the almost hypercomplex structure we define two new families of Finsler connections. Also we show that for any Finsler connection \nabla there exists a linear connection D such that the local almost hypercomplex structure is parallel with respect to it.
