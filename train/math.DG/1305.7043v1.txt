In this paper, we define a new kind of slant helix called f-eikonal V_{n}-slant helix in Pseudo- Riemannian manifolds and give the definition of harmonic curvature functions related to the f-eikonal V_{n}-slant helix in Pseudo- Riemannian manifolds. Moreover, we give some characterizations of f-eikonal V_{n}-slant helix by making use of the harmonic curvature functions.
