We consider biharmonic maps \phi:(M,g)\rightarrow (N,h) from a complete Riemannian manifold into a Riemannian manifold with non-positive sectional curvature. Assume that \alpha satisfies 1<\alpha<\infty. If for such an \alpha, \int_M|\tau(\phi)|^{\alpha}dv_g<\infty and \int_M|d\phi|^2dv_g<\infty, where \tau(\phi) is the tension field of \phi, then we show that \phi is harmonic. For a biharmonic submanifold, we obtain that the above assumption \int_M|d\phi|^2dv_g<\infty is not necessary. These results give affirmative partial answers to the global version of generalized Chen's conjecture.
