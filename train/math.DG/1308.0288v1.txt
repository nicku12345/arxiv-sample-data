We investigate the geometric properties of hyperbolic affine flat, affine minimal surfaces in the equiaffine space \mathbb{A}^3. We use Cartan's method of moving frames to compute a complete set of local invariants for such surfaces. Using these invariants, we give a complete local classification of such surfaces and construct new examples.
