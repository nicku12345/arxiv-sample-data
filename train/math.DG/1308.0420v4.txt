We consider polyharmonic maps \phi:(M,g)\rightarrow \mathbb{E}^n of order k from a complete Riemannian manifold into the Euclidean space and let p be a real constant satisfying 1<p<\infty. (i) If, \int_M|W^{k-1}|^p dv_g<\infty, and \int_M|\bar \nabla W^{k-2}|^2dv_g<\infty. Then \phi is a polyharmonic map of order k-1. (ii) If, \int_M|W^{k-1}|^p dv_g<\infty, and Vol (M,g)=\infty. Then \phi is a polyharmonic map of order k-1. Here, W^s=\bar\Delta^{s-1}\tau(\phi) (s=1,2,...) and W^0=\phi. As a corollary, we give an affirmative partial answer to generalized Chen's conjecture.
