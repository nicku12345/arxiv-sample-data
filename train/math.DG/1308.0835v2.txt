Let \omega_\mathfrak{g} be a Lie algebra valued differential 1-form on a manifold M satisfying the structure equations d \omega_\mathfrak{g} + \frac{1}{2} \omega_\mathfrak{g}\wedge \omega_\mathfrak{g}=0 where \mathfrak{g} is solvable. We show that the problem of finding a smooth map \rho:M\to G, where G is an n-dimensional solvable Lie group with Lie algebra \mathfrak{g} and left invariant Maurer-Cartan form \tau, such that \rho^* \tau= \omega_\mathfrak{g} can be solved by quadratures and the matrix exponential. In the process we give a closed form formula for the vector fields in Lie's third theorem for solvable Lie algebras. A further application produces the multiplication map for a simply connected n-dimensional solvable Lie group using only the matrix exponential and n quadratures. Applications to finding first integrals for completely integrable Pfaffian systems with solvable symmetry algebras are also given.
