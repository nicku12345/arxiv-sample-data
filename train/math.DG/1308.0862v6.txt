We consider a set of gauge-theoretic equations on closed oriented four-manifolds, which was introduced by Vafa and Witten. The equations involve a triple consisting of a connection and extra fields associated to a principal bundle over a closed oriented four-manifold. They are similar to Hitchin's equations over compact Riemann surfaces, and as part of the resemblance, there is no L^2-bound on the curvature without an L^2-bound on the extra fields. In this article, however, we observe that under the particular circumstance where the curvature does not become concentrated and the limiting connection is not locally reducible, one obtains an L^2-bound on the extra fields.
