We define cuspidal curvature \kappa_c (resp. normalized cuspidal curvature \mu_c) along cuspidal edges (resp. at swallowtail singularity) in Riemannian 3-manifolds, and show that it gives a coefficient of the divergent term of the mean curvature function. Moreover, we show that the product \kappa_\Pi called the product curvature (resp. \mu_\Pi called normalized product curvature) of \kappa_c (resp. \mu_c) and the limiting normal curvature \kappa_\nu is an intrinsic invariant of the surface, and is closely related to the boundedness of the Gaussian curvature. We also consider the limiting behavior of \kappa_\Pi when cuspidal edges accumulate to other singularities. Moreover, several new geometric invariants of cuspidal edges and swallowtails are given.
