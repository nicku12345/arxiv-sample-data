We give a new method for manufacturing complete minimal submanifolds of compact Lie groups and their homogeneous quotient spaces. For this we make use of harmonic morphisms and basic representation theory of Lie groups. We then apply our method to construct many examples of compact minimal submanifolds of the special unitary groups.
