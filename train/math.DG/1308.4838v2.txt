We consider a three-dimensional Riemannian manifold equipped with two circulant structures - a metric g and a structure q, which is an isometry with respect to g and the third power of q is minus identity. We discuss some curvature properties of this manifold, we give an example of such a manifold and find a condition for q to be parallel with respect to the Riemannian connection of g.
