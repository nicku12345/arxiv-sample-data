It is well-known that the spectrum of a \text{spin}^{\mathbb{C}} Dirac operator on a closed Riemannian \text{spin}^{\mathbb{C}} manifold M^{2k} of dimension 2k for k \in \mathbb{N} is symmetric. In this article, we prove that over an odd-dimensional Riemannian product M_{1}^{2p} \times M_{2}^{2q+1} with a product \text{spin}^{\mathbb{C}} structure for p \geq 1, q \geq 0, the spectrum of a \text{spin}^{\mathbb{C}} Dirac operator given by a product connection is symmetric if and only if either the \text{spin}^{\mathbb{C}} Dirac spectrum of M_{2}^{2q+1} is symmetric or (e^{\frac{1}{2}c_{1}(L_{1})} \hat{A}(M_1))[M_{1}]=0, where L_1 is the associated line bundle for the given \text{spin}^{\mathbb{C}} structure of M_1.
