An isometric immersion f:M^n\to \tilde M^n from a Riemannian n-manifold M^n into a K\"ahler n-manifold \tilde M^n is called {\it Lagrangian} if the complex structure J of the ambient manifold \tilde M^n interchanges each tangent space of M^n with the corresponding normal space. In this paper, we completely classify spherical Lagrangian submanifolds in complex Euclidean spaces. Furthermore, we also provide two corresponding classification theorems for Lagrangian submanifolds in the complex pseudo-Euclidean spaces with arbitrary complex index.
