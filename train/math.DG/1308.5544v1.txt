In this paper, firstly, inspired by Nat\'{a}rio's recent work \cite{Na}, we use the isoperimetric inequality to derive some Alexandrov-Fenchel type inequalities for closed convex hypersurfaces in the hyperbolic space \H^{n+1} and in the sphere \SS^{n+1}. We also get the rigidity in the spherical case. Secondly, we use the inverse mean curvature flow in sphere \cite{gerh,Mak-Sch} to prove an optimal Sobolev type inequality for closed convex hypersurfaces in the sphere.
