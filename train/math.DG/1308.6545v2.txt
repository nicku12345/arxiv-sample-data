We consider the class of differential equations that describe pseudo-spherical surfaces of the form u\_t=F(u,u\_x,u\_{xx}) and u\_{xt}=F(u, u\_x) given in Chern-Tenenblat \cite{ChernTenenblat} and Rabelo-Tenenblat \cite{RabeloTenenblat90}. We answer the following question: Given a pseudo-spherical surface determined by a solution u of such an equation, do the coefficients of the second fundamental form of the local isometric immersion in \mathbb{R}^3 depend on a jet of finite order of u? We show that, except for the sine-Gordon equation, where the coefficients depend on a jet of order zero, for all other differential equations, whenever such an immersion exists, the coefficients are universal functions of x and t, independent of u.
