We study the global geometry of surfaces in Sasakian space forms whose mean curvature vector is parallel in the normal bundle (these include the Riemannian Heisenberg space of dimension 2n+1). We prove a codimension reduction theorem. We introduce two holomorphic quadratic differentials on anti-invariant such surfaces and use them to obtain classification theorems.
