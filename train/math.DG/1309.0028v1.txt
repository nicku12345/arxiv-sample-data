In this work we investigate families of compact Lorentzian manifolds in dimension four. We show that every lightlike geodesic on such spaces is periodic, while there are closed and non-closed spacelike and timelike geodesics. Their isometry groups are computed. We also show that there is a non trivial action by isometries of \Heis_3(\RR) on the nilmanifold S^1\times (\Gamma_k \bsh \Heis_3(\RR)) for \Gamma_k a lattice of \Heis_3(\RR).
