We study critical Riemannian 4-manifolds with a lower bound on Ricci curvature, but no a priori analytic constraints such as on Sobolev constants. We derive elliptic-type estimates for the local curvature radius, which itself controls sectional curvature. The primary method is construction of blow-ups of degenerating metrics, followed by a geometric/topological triviality result from a previous work.
