In this paper, first we give a notion for linear Weingarten spacelike hypersurfaces with P+aH=b in a locally symmetric Lorentz space L_{1}^{n+1}. Furthermore, we study complete or compact linear Weingarten spacelike hypersurfaces in locally symmetric Lorentz spaces L_{1}^{n+1} satisfying some curvature conditions. By modifying Cheng-Yau's operator \square given in {\cite{ChengYau77}}, we introduce a modified operator L and give new estimates of L(nH) and \square(nH) of such spacelike hypersurfaces. Finally, we give partial generalizations of some conjectures in locally symmetric Lorentz spaces L_{1}^{n+1}.
