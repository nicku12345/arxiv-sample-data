Space-like maximal surfaces and time-like minimal surfaces in Lorentz-Minkowski3-space are both characterized as zero mean curvature surfaces. We are interested in the case where the zero mean curvature surface changes type from space-like to time-like at a given non-degenerate null curve. We consider this phenomenon and its interesting connection to 2-dimensional fluid mechanics in this expository article.
