In this paper, we use the normalized Ricci-DeTurk flow to prove a stability result for strictly stable conformally compact Einstein manifolds. As an application, we show a local volume comparison of conformally compact manifolds with scalar curvature R\geq -n\left(n-1\right) and also the rigidity result when certain renormalized volume is zero.
