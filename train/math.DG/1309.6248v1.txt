In this work, we prove an optimal Penrose inequality for asymptotically locally hyperbolic manifolds which can be realized as graphs over Kottler space. Such inequality relies heavily on an optimal weighted Alexandrov-Fenchel inequality for the mean convex star shaped hypersurfaces in Kottler space.
