By the calculation of the gap of the consecutive eigenvalues of \Bbb S^n with standard metric, using the Weyl's asymptotic formula, we know the order of the upper bound of this gap is k^{\frac{1}{n}}. We conjecture that this order is also right for general Dirichlet problem of the Laplace operator, which is optimal if this conjecture holds, obviously. In this paper, using new method, we solve this conjecture in the Euclidean space case intrinsically. We think our method is valid for the case of general Riemannian manifolds and give some examples directly.
