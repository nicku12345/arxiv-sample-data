In this paper we prove that on a complete smooth metric measure space with non-negative Bakry-\'Emery-Ricci curvature if the space of weighted L^2 harmonic one-forms is non-trivial then the weighted volume of the manifold is finite and universal cover of the manifold splits isometrically as the product of the real line with an hypersurface.
