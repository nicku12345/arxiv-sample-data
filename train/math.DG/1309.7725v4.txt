We generalize A. Borb\'ely's condition for the conclusion of the Omori-Yau maximum principle for the Laplace operator on a complete Riemannian manifold to a second-order linear semi-elliptic operator L with bounded coefficients and no zeroth order term. Also, we consider a new sufficient condition for the existence of a tamed exhaustion function. As a corollary, we show that the existence of a tamed exhaustion function is more general than the hypotheses in the version of the Omori-Yau maximum principle that was given by A. Ratto, M. Rigoli and A.G. Setti.
