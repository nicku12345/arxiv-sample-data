We study generalized Killing spinors on round spheres \mathbb{S}^n. We show that on the standard sphere \mathbb{S}^8 any generalized Killing spinor has to be an ordinary Killing spinor. Moreover we classify generalized Killing spinors on \mathbb{S}^n whose associated symmetric endomorphism has at most two eigenvalues and recover in particular Agricola--Friedrich's canonical spinor on 3-Sasakian manifolds of dimension 7. Finally we show that it is not possible to deform Killing spinors on standard spheres into genuine generalized Killing spinors.
