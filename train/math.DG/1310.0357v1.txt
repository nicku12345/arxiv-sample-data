We find the first examples of real hypersurfaces with two nonconstant principal curvatures in complex projective and hyperbolic planes, and we classify them. It turns out that each such hypersurface is foliated by equidistant Lagrangian flat surfaces with parallel mean curvature or, equivalently, by principal orbits of a cohomogeneity two polar action.
