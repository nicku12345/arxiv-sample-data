Here, a non-linear analysis method is applied rather than classical one to study projective Finsler geometry. More intuitively, by means of an inequality on Ricci-Finsler curvature, a projectively invariant pseudo-distance is introduced and an analogous of Schwarz' lemma in Finsler geometry is proved. Next, the Schwarz' lemma is applied to show that the introduced pseudo-distance is a distance. This projectively invariant distance will be served in continuation of this work to investigate Einstein-Finsler spaces and classify Finsler spaces as well.
