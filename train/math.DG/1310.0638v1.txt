In this work an intrinsic projectively invariant distance is used to establish a new approach to the study of projective geometry in Finsler space. It is shown that the projectively invariant distance previously defined is a constant multiple of the Finsler distance in certain case. As a consequence, two projectively related complete Einstein Finsler spaces with constant negative scalar curvature are homothetic. Evidently, this will be true for Finsler spaces of constant flag curvature as well.
