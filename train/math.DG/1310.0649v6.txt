In this paper, we investigate complete curvature-adapted submanifolds with maximal flat section and trivial normal holonomy group in symmetric spaces of compact type or non-compact type under certain condition, and derive the constancy of the principal curvatures of such submanifolds. As its result, we can derive that such submanifolds are isoparametric.
