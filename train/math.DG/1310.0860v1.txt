For a compact Riemannian manifold (M, g_2) with constant Q-curvature of dimension n\geq 6 satisfying nondegeneracy condition, we show that one can construct many examples of constant Q-curvature manifolds by gluing construction. We provide a general procedure of gluing together (M,g_2) with any compact manifold (N, g_1) satisfying a geometric assumption. In particular, we can prove that there exists a metric with constant Q-curvature on the connected sum N #M.
