In this paper, we introduce a study of prolongations of homogeneous vector bundles. We give an alternative approach for the prolongation. For a given homogeneous vector bundle E, we obtain a new homogeneous vector bundle. The homogeneous structure and its corresponding representation are derived. The prolongation of induced representation, which is an infinite dimensional linear representation, is also defined.
