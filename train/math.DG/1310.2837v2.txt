We consider the evolution by mean curvature flow of Lagrangian submanifolds of the complex projective space CP^n. We prove that, if the initial value satisfies a suitable pinching condition, then the flow exists for all times and the manifold converges to a totally geodesic submanifold. As a corollary, we obtain that a Lagrangian submanifold satisfying our pinching condition is diffeomorphic to a real projective space.
