It is an interesting question whether a given equation of motion has a periodic solution or not, and in the positive case to describe them. We investigate periodic magnetic curves in elliptic Sasakian space forms and we obtain a quantization principle for periodic magnetic flowlines on Berger spheres. We give a criterion for periodicity of magnetic curves on the unit sphere {\mathbb{S}}^3.
