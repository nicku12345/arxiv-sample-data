It is known that, for Dirac operators on Riemann surfaces twisted by line bundles with Hermitian-Einstein connections, it is possible to obtain estimates for the first eigenvalue in terms of the topology of the twisting bundle \cite{JL2}. Attempts to generalize topological estimates for higher rank bundles or higher dimensional manifolds have been so far unsuccessful. In this work we construct a class of examples which indicates one problem that arises on such attempts to derive topological estimates.
