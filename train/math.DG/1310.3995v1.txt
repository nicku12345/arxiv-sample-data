We find out upper bounds for the first eigenvalue of the stability operator for compact constant mean curvature surfaces immersed into certain 3-dimensional Riemannian spaces, in particular into homogeneous 3-manifolds. As an application we derive some consequences for strongly stable surfaces in such ambient spaces. Moreover, we also get a characterization of Hopf tori in certain Berger spheres.
