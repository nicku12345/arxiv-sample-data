We find out upper bounds for the first eigenvalue of the stability operator for compact constant mean curvature orientable surfaces immersed in a Riemannian Killing submersion. As a consequence, the strong stability of such surfaces is studied. We also characterize constant mean curvature Hopf tori as the only ones attaining the bound in certain cases.
