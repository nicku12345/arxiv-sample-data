When a Lie group G has a central U(1)-extension, there is a cocycle in the simplicial de Rham complex \Omega^3(NG) which represents the Dixmier-Douady class. Mickelsson and Brylinski, McLaughlin constructed a central U(1)-extension \widehat{LSU(2)} \rightarrow LSU(2) whose Dixmier-Douady class in \Omega^3(NLSU(2)) is a kind of transgression of the second Chern class.   In this paper, we consider the case of unitary group and construct a central U(1)-extension of LU(2). After that we construct also a cocycle in a certain triple complex.
