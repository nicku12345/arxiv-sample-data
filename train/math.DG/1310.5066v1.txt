In this paper, we explicitly construct the Calabi composition of multiple affine hyperspheres possibly including some points viewing as 0-dimensional hypersheres. Then we compute all the basic affine invariants of the composed affine hyperspheres, proving that the composed affine hypersphere is symmetric one if and only if each of its composing factors of positive dimension is symmetric.
