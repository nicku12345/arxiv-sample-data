In this article we extend several foundational results of the theory of complete minimal surfaces of finite index in the Euclidean space to minimal surfaces in asymptotically flat manifolds and, more generally, to marginally outer-trapped surfaces in initial data sets of General Relativity. We show that if an asymptotically flat 3-manifold (M,g) of nonnegative scalar curvature contains a non-compact, properly embedded minimal surface which is stable and has quadratic area growth, then it is isometric to the flat R^{3}. This implies, for instance, that in presence of a positive ADM mass any sequence of solutions to the Plateau problem with diverging boundaries can never have uniform height bounds, even at a single point. The proof of this theorem is based on a characterization of finite index minimal surfaces, on classical infinitesimal rigidity results by Fischer-Colbrie and Schoen and on the positive mass theorem by Schoen-Yau. More specifically, we also show that a complete minimal surface of finite index inside an asymptotically flat 3-manifold has finitely many ends and each of these is a graph of a function that has a suitable expansion at infinity, in analogy with a classical result by Schoen for Euclidean spaces. In addition, we prove that a non-compact stable MOTS in an initial data set (M,g,k) is conformally diffeomorphic to either the plane C or to the cylinder A and in the latter case infinitesimal rigidity holds. If the data have harmonic asymptotics, the former case is also proven to be globally rigid in the sense that the presence of a stable MOTS forces an isometric embedding of (M,g,k) in the Minkowski space-time (\mathbb{M},\eta) as a space-like slice.
