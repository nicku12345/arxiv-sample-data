In this paper we give a characterization of real hypersurfaces in noncompact complex two-plane Grassmannian SU_{2,m}/S(U_2 U_m), m \geq 2 with Reeb vector field \xi belonging to the maximal quaternionic subbundle \mathcal Q. Then it becomes a tube over a totally real totally geodesic {\mathbb H}H^n, m=2n, in noncompact complex two-plane Grassmannian SU_{2,m}/S(U_2 U_m), a horosphere whose center at the infinity is singular or another exceptional case.
