Using 4-dimensional arithmetic hyperbolic manifolds, we construct some new homological quantum error correcting codes. They are LDPC codes with linear rate and distance n^\epsilon. Their rate is evaluated via Euler characteristic arguments and their distance using \mathbb{Z}_2-systolic geometry. This construction answers a queston of Z\'emor, who asked whether homological codes with such parameters could exist at all.
