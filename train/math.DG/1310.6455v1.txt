In this paper, we first deduce a formula of S-curvature of homogeneous Finsler spaces in terms of Killing vector fields. Then we prove that a homogeneous Finsler space has isotropic S-curvature if and only if it has vanishing S-curvature. In the special case that the homogeneous Finsler space is a Randers space, we give an explicit formula which coincides with the previous formula obtained by the second author using other methods.
