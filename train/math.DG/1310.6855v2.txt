We construct point invariants of ordinary differential equations that generalise the Cartan invariants of equations of order two and three. The vanishing of the invariants is equivalent to the existence of a totally geodesic paraconformal structure which consist of a paraconformal structure, an adapted GL(2,\R)-connection and a two-parameter family of totally geodesic hypersurfaces on the solution space. The structures coincide with the projective structures in dimension 2 and with the Einstein-Weyl structures of Lorentzian signature in dimension 3. We show that the totally geodesic paraconformal structures in higher dimensions can be described by a natural analogue of the Hitchin twistor construction. We present a general example of Veronese webs which correspond to the hyper-CR Einstein-Weyl structures in dimension 3. The Veronese webs are described by a hierarchy of integrable systems.
