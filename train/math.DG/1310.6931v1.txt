In this study, we give definitions and characterizations of eikonal slant helix curves, eikonal Darboux helices and non-normed eikonal Darboux helices in three dimensional Riemannian manifold 3 M . We show that every eikonal slant helix is also an eikonal Darboux helix. Furthermore, we obtain that if the curve a is a non-normed eikonal Darboux helix, then a is an eikonal slant helix if and only if k 2 +t 2 = constant, where k and t are curvature and torsion of a, respectively.
