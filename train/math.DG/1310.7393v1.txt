Horizontal endomorphisms, almost complex structures, vertical, horizontal and complete lifts on prolongation of a Lie algebroid are considered. Then using exact sequences, semisprays are constructed. Moreover, important geometrical objects such as classical distinguished connections, torsions and partial curvatures are studied on prolongation of Lie algebroids. Considering pullback bundle, covariant derivatives are scrutinized based on anchor map. Several Finsler geometry models on Lie algebroid structures, will organized via recent arguments. Finally, it will be overhaulled some special Finsler Lie algebroid spaces.
