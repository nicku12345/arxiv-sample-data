We investigate principal G-bundles on a compact K\"ahler manifold, where G is a complex algebraic group such that the connected component of it containing the identity element is reductive. Defining (semi)stability of such bundles, it is shown that a principal G-bundle E_G admits an Einstein-Hermitian connection if and only if E_G is polystable. We give an equivalent formulation of the (semi)stability condition. A question is to compare this definition with that of math.AG/0506511.
