We introduce a method to construct G_2-instantons over compact G_2-manifolds arising as the twisted connected sum of a matching pair of building blocks [Kov03,KL11,CHNP12]. Our construction is based on gluing G_2-instantons obtained from holomorphic bundles over the building blocks via the first named author's work [SE11]. We require natural compatibility and transversality conditions which can be interpreted in terms of certain Lagrangian subspaces of a moduli space of stable bundles on a K3 surface.
