Let (M,F) be a C^\infty Finsler manifold, p\geq 1 a real number, k a positive integer and H_k^p (M) a certain Sobolev space determined by a Finsler structure F.   Here, it is shown that the set of all real C^{\infty} functions with compact support on M is dense in the Sobolev space H_1^p (M).   This result permits to approximate certain solution of Dirichlet problem living on H_1^p (M) by C^ \infty functions with compact support on (M,F).   Moreover, let W \subset M be a regular domain with the C^r boundary \partial W, then the set of all real functions in C^r (W) \cap C^0 (\overline W) is dense in H_k^p (W), where k\leq r. This work is an extension of some density theorems of T. Aubin on Riemannian manifolds.
