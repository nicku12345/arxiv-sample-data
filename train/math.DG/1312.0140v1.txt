The purpose of this article is to give an explicit formula for all curves of constant torsion \tau in the unit two-sphere S^2(1). These curves and their basic properties have been known since the 1890's, and some of these properties are discussed in the Appendix. Some example curves, computed with a standard ODE package, with \tau=.1,.5,1,2 are shown in Figure \ref{peter}. Though their existence and some of their general properties were known, our explicit formulas for them, in terms of hypergeometric functions, are new.
