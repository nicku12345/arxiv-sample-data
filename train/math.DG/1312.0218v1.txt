In this paper, we obtain "universal" inequalities for eigenvalues of the weighted Hodge Laplacian on a compact self-shrinker of Euclidean space. These inequalities generalize the Yang-type and Levitin-Parnovski inequalities for eigenvalues of the Laplacian and Laplacian. From the recursion formula of Cheng and Yang \cite{ChengYang07}, the Yang-type inequality for eigenvalues of the weighted Hodge Laplacian are optimal in the sense of the order of eigenvalues.
