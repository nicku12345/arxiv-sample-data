We find the complete set of fundamental invariants for systems of ordinary differential equations of order \ge 4 under the group of point transformations generalizing similar results for contact invariants of a single ODE and point invariants of systems of the second and the third order.   It turns out that starting from systems of order (k+1)\ge 4, the complete set of fundamental invariants is formed by k generalized Wilczynski invariants coming from the linearized system and an additional invariant of degree 2.
