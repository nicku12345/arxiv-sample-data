In this paper, we first prove that any closed simply connected 4-manifold that admits a decomposition into two disk bundles of rank greater than 1 is diffeomorphic to one of the standard elliptic 4-manifolds: \mathbb{S}^4, \mathbb{CP}^2, \mathbb{S}^2\times\mathbb{S}^2, or \mathbb{CP}^2\#\pm \mathbb{CP}^2. As an application we prove that any closed simply connected 4-manifold admitting a nontrivial singular Riemannian foliation is diffeomorphic to a connected sum of copies of standard \mathbb{S}^4, \pm\mathbb{CP}^2 and \mathbb{S}^2\times\mathbb{S}^2. A classification of singular Riemannian foliations of codimension 1 on all closed simply connected 4-manifolds is obtained as a byproduct. In particular, there are exactly 3 non-homogeneous singular Riemannian foliations of codimension 1, complementing the list of cohomogeneity one 4-manifolds.
