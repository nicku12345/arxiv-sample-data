It is shown that analytic conformal submersions of S^3 are given by intersections of (not necessary closed) complex surfaces with a quadratic real hyper-surface in \mathbb{C}P^3. A new description of the space of circles in the 3-sphere in terms of a natural bilinear form on the tangent sphere bundle of S^3 is given. As an application it is shown that every conformal fibration of S^3 by circles is the Hopf fibration up to conformal transformations.
