We show that for any coboundary Poisson Lie group G, the Poisson structure on G^* is linearizable at the group unit. This strengthens a result of Enriquez-Etingof-Marshall, who had established formal linearizability of G^* for quasi-triangular Poisson Lie groups G. We also prove linearizability properties for the group multiplication in G^* and for Poisson Lie group morphisms, with similar assumptions.
