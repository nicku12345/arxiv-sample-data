We are interested in the class, in the Elie Cartan sense, of left invariant forms on a Lie group. We construct the class of Lie algebras provided with a contact form and classify the frobeniusian Lie algebras up to a contraction. We also study forms which are invariant by a subgroup. We show that the simple group SL(2n,R) which doesn't admit left invariant contact form, yet admits a contact form which is invariant by a maximal compact subgroup. We determine also Pfaffian forms on the Heisenberg 3-dimensional group invariant by a subgroup and obtain the Transport Equation.
