Let G be a connected Lie group and \mathfrak{g} its Lie algebra. We denote by \nabla^0 the torsion free bi-invariant linear connection on G given by \nabla^0_XY=\frac12[X,Y], for any left invariant vector fields X,Y. A Poisson structure on \mathfrak{g} is a commutative and associative product on \mathfrak{g} for which \mathrm{ad}_u is a derivation, for any u\in\mathfrak{g}.   A torsion free bi-invariant linear connections on G which have the same curvature as \nabla^0 is called special. We show that there is a bijection between the space of special connections on G and the space of Poisson structures on \mathfrak{g}. We compute the holonomy Lie algebra of a special connection and we show that the Poisson structures associated to special connections which have the same holonomy Lie algebra as \nabla^0 possess interesting properties. Finally, we study Poisson structures on a Lie algebra and we give a large class of examples which gives, of course, a large class of special connections.
