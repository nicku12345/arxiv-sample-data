The Gaussian curvature K is a fundamental geometric quantity discovered by Gauss in the case of surfaces embedded in \mathbb{R}^3. One can naturally extend the definition of the Gaussian curvature to arbitrary submanifolds of \mathbb{R}^k so that the extrinsic interpretation of K, the Theorema Egregium and the Gauss-Bonnet Theorem still hold. We give a concise exposition of these classical facts.
