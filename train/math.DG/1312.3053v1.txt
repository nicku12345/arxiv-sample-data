In this paper, using the framework of equivariant differential geometry, we study proper SO(p+1) \times SO(q+1)-invariant biconservative hypersurfaces into the Euclidean space {\mathbb R}^n (n=p+q+2) and proper SO(p+1)-invariant biconservative hypersurfaces into the Euclidean space {\mathbb R}^n (n=p+2). Moreover, we show that, in these two classes of invariant families, there exists no proper biharmonic immersion.
