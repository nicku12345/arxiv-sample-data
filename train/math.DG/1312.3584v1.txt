In this paper, we study rigidity problems for hypersurfaces with constant curvature quotients \frac{\mathcal{H}_{2k+1}}{\mathcal{H}_{2k}} in the warped product manifolds. Here \mathcal{H}_{2k} is the k-th Gauss-Bonnet curvature and \mathcal{H}_{2k+1} arises from the first variation of the total integration of \mathcal{H}_{2k}. Hence the quotients considered here are in general different from \frac{\sigma_{2k+1}}{\sigma_{2k}}, where \sigma_k are the usual mean curvatures. We prove several rigidity and Bernstein type results for compact or non-compact hypersurfaces corresponding to such quotients.
