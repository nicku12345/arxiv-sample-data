In this paper we obtain a simple upper bound for the infimum of the Ricci curvatures of a complete Riemannian manifold with nonzero injectivity radius i(M) depending only on of the i(M). In case of rigidity the Riemannian manifold must be an Euclidean sphere(Euclidean space) conform the injectivity radius be finite(infinite). Furthermore with the additional assumption that the second derivative of the Ricci tensor is null we prove that the same upper bound for the infimum of the Ricci curvatures holds for the supremum of the Ricci curvatures and M^n has, in fact, parallel Ricci tensor.
