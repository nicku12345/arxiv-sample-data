We list up all the possible local orbit types of hyperbolic or elliptic orbits for the isotropy representations of semisimple pseudo-Riemannian symmetric spaces. It is key to give a recipe to determine the local orbit types of hyperbolic principal orbits by using three kind of restricted root systems and Satake diagrams associated with semisimple pseudo-Riemannian symmetric spaces.
