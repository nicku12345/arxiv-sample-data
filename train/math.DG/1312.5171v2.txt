We provide new results and new proofs of results about the torsion of curves in \mathbb{R}^3. Let \gamma be a smooth curve in \mathbb{R}^3 that is the graph over a simple closed curve in \mathbb{R}^2 with positive curvature. We give a new proof that if \gamma has nonnegative (or nonpositive) torsion, then \gamma has zero torsion and hence lies in a plane. Additionally, we prove the new result that a simple closed plane curve, without any assumption on its curvature, cannot be perturbed to a closed space curve of constant nonzero torsion. We also prove similar statements for curves in Lorentzian \mathbb{R}^{2,1} which are related to important open questions about time flat surfaces in spacetimes and mass in general relativity.
