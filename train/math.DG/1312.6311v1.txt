For any closed Riemannian manifold X we prove that large isoperimetric regions in X\times{\mathbb R}^n are of the form X\times(Euclidean ball). We prove that if X has non-negative Ricci curvature then the only soap bubbles enclosing a large volume are the products X\times(Euclidean sphere). We give an example of a surface X, with Gaussian curvature negative somewhere, such that the product X\times{\mathbb R} contains stable soap bubbles of arbitrarily large enclosed volume which do not even project surjectively onto the X factor.
