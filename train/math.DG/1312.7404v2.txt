We investigate complete noncompact Ricci-flat manifolds which are not of maximal volume growth. We show that the manifolds with a curvature decay condition and a holonomy decay condition are asymptotic to torus fibrations over ALE spaces. In particular, we classify complete noncompact 4-dimensional hyperk\"aler manifolds by the volume growth. As an application, we give the uniqueness of tangent cones of collapsing manifolds with some conditions.
