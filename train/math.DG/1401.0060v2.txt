We show that for every complete Riemannian surface M diffeomorphic to a sphere with k \geq 0 holes there exists a Morse function f:M \rightarrow \mathbb{R}, which is constant on each connected component of the boundary of M and has fibers of length no more than 52 \sqrt{Area(M)}+length(\partial M). We also show that on every 2-sphere there exists a simple closed curve of length \leq 26 \sqrt{Area(S^2)} subdividing the sphere into two discs of area \geq \frac{1}{3}Area(S^2)
