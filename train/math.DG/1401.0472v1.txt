In this paper, we introduce a new type of Finsler metrics, called (\alpha_1,\alpha_2)-metrics. We define the notion of the good datum of a homogeneous (\alpha_1,\alpha_2)-metric and use that to study the geometric properties. In particular, we give a formula of the S-curvature and deduce a condition for the S-curvature to be vanishing identically. Moreover, we consider the restrictive Clifford-Wolf homogeneity of left invariant (\alpha_1,\alpha_2)-metrics on compact connected simple Lie groups. We prove that, in some special cases, a restrictively Clifford-Wolf homogeneous (\alpha_1,\alpha_2)-metric must be Riemannian. An unexpected interesting observation contained in the proof reveals the fact that the S-curvature may play an important role in the study of Clifford-Wolf homogeneity in Finsler geometry.
