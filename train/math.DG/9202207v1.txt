In the main part of this paper a connection is just a fiber projection onto a (not necessarily integrable) distribution or sub vector bundle of the tangent bundle. Here curvature is computed via the Froelicher-Nijenhuis bracket, and it is complemented by cocurvature and the Bianchi identity still holds. In this situation we determine the graded Lie algebra of all graded derivations over the horizontal projection of a connection and we determine their commutation relations. Finally, for a principal connection on a principal bundle and the induced connection on an associated bundle we show how one may pass from one to the other. The final results relate derivations on vector bundle valued forms and derivations over the horizontal projection of the algebra of forms on the principal bundle with values in the standard vector space.
