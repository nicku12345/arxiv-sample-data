This note announces a general construction of characteristic currents for singular connections on a vector bundle. It develops, in particular, a Chern-Weil-Simons theory for smooth bundle maps \alpha : E \rightarrow F which, for smooth connections on E and F, establishes formulas of the type  \phi \ = \ \text{\rm Res}_{\phi}\Sigma_{\alpha} + dT.  Here \phi is a standard charactersitic form, \text{Res}_{\phi} is an associated smooth ``residue'' form computed canonically in terms of curvature, \Sigma_{\alpha} is a rectifiable current depending only on the singular structure of \alpha, and T is a canonical, functorial transgression form with coefficients in \loc. The theory encompasses such classical topics as: Poincar\'e-Lelong Theory, Bott-Chern Theory, Chern-Weil Theory, and formulas of Hopf. Applications include:\ \ a new proof of the Riemann-Roch Theorem for vector bundles over algebraic curves, a C^{\infty}-generalization of the Poincar\'e-Lelong Formula, universal formulas for the Thom class as an equivariant characteristic form (i.e., canonical formulas for a de Rham representative of the Thom class of a bundle with connection), and a Differentiable Riemann-Roch-Grothendieck Theorem at the level of forms and currents. A variety of formulas relating geometry and characteristic classes are deduced as direct consequences of the theory.
