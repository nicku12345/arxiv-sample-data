We develop an asymptotic expansion of the spectral measures on a degenerating family of hyperbolic Riemann surfaces of finite volume. As an application of our results, we study the asymptotic behavior of weighted counting functions, which, if M is compact, is defined for w \geq 0 and T > 0 by N_{M,w}(T) = \sum\limits_{\lambda_n \leq T}(T-\lambda_n)^w  where \{\lambda_n\} is the set of eigenvalues of the Laplacian which acts on the space of smooth functions on M. If M is non-compact, then the weighted counting function is defined via the inverse Laplace transform. Now let M_{\ell} denote a degenerating family of compact or non-compact hyperbolic Riemann surfaces of finite volume which converges to the non-compact hyperbolic surface M_{0}. As an example of our results, we have the following theorem: There is an explicitly defined function G_{\ell,w}(T) which depends solely on \ell, w, and T such that for w > 3/2 and T>0, we have N_{M_{\ell},w}(T) = G_{\ell,w}(T) +N_{M_{0},w}(T) +o(1) for \ell \to 0. We also consider the setting when w < 3/2, and we obtain a new proof of the continuity of small eigenvalues on degenerating hyperbolic Riemann surfaces of finite volume.
