The Margulis constant for Kleinian groups is the smallest constant c such that for each discrete group G and each point x in the upper half space {\bold H}^3, the group generated by the elements in G which move x less than distance c is elementary. We take a first step towards determining this constant by proving that if \langle f,g \rangle is nonelementary and discrete with f parabolic or elliptic of order n \geq 3, then every point x in {\bold H}^3 is moved at least distance c by f or g where c=.1829\ldots. This bound is sharp.
