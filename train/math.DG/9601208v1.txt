The authors study the Hodge theory of the exterior differential operator d acting on q-forms on a smoothly bounded domain in \RR^{N+1}, and on the half space \rnp. The novelty is that the topology used is not an L^2 topology but a Sobolev topology. This strikingly alters the problem as compared to the classical setup. It gives rise to a boundary-value problem belonging to a class of problems first introduced by Vi\v{s}ik and Eskin, and by Boutet de Monvel.
