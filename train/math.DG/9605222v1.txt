We prove the existence of a complete, embedded, singly periodic minimal surface, whose quotient by vertical translations has genus one and two ends. The existence of this surface was announced in our paper in {\it Bulletin of the AMS}, 29(1):77--84, 1993. Its ends in the quotient are asymptotic to one full turn of the helicoid, and, like the helicoid, it contains a vertical line. Modulo vertical translations, it has two parallel horizontal lines crossing the vertical axis. The nontrivial symmetries of the surface, modulo vertical translations, consist of: 180^\circ rotation about the vertical line; 180^\circ rotation about the horizontal lines (the same symmetry); and their composition.
