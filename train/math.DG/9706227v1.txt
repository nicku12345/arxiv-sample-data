Let K be an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero, endowed with a complete nonarchimedean norm. Let X be a K-rigid analytic variety and \Sigma a semianalytic subset of X. Then the closure of \Sigma in X with respect to the canonical topology is again semianalytic. The proof uses Embedded Resolution of Singularities.
