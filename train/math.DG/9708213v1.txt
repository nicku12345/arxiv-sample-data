We classify simple singularities of functions on space curves. We show that their bifurcation sets have properties very similar to those of functions on smooth manifolds and complete intersections [1,2]: the k(pi, 1)-theorem for the bifurcations diagram of functions is true, and both this diagram and the discriminant are Saito's free divisors.
