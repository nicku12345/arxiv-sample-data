The ends of a complete embedded minimal surface of {\em finite total curvature} are well understood (every such end is asymptotic to a catenoid or to a plane). We give a similar characterization for a large class of ends of {\em infinite total curvature}, showing that each such end is asymptotic to a helicoid. The result applies, in particular, to the genus one helicoid and implies that it is embedded outside of a compact set in {\mathbb R}^3.
