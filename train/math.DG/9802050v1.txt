A closed spin K\"ahler manifold of positive scalar curvature with smallest possible first eigenvalue of the Dirac operator is characterized by holomorphic spinors. It is shown that on any spin K\"ahler-Einstein manifold each holomorphic spinor is a finite sum of eigenspinors of the square of the Dirac operator. Vanishing theorems for holomorphic spinors are proved.
