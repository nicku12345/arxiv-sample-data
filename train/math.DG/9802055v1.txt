In this paper we announce a gluing theorem for conformal structures with anti-self-dual (ASD) Weyl tensor that applies in geometrical situations that are more general than those considered by previous authors. By adapting a method proposed by Floer, sufficient conditions are given for the existence of ASD conformal structures on `generalized connected sums' of non-compact ASD 4-manifolds with cylindrical ends. The gluing theorem applies in particular to give results about connected sums of ASD orbifolds along (isolated) singular points.
