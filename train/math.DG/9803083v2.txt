This paper shows that there are symplectic four-manifolds M with the following property: a single isotopy class of smooth embedded two-spheres in M contains infinitely many Lagrangian submanifolds, no two of which are isotopic as Lagrangian submanifolds. The examples are constructed using a special class of symplectic automorphisms ("generalized Dehn twists"). The proof uses Floer homology.   Revised version: one footnote removed, one reference added
