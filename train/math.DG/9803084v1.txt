Let M be the cotangent bundle of S^2, with the standard symplectic structure. By adapting an argument of Gromov we determine the weak homotopy type of the group S of those symplectic automorphisms of M which are trivial at infinity. It turns out that S is weakly homotopy equivalent to \Z. \pi_0(S) is generated by the class of the standard "generalized Dehn twist". As a consequence, we show that there are different connected components of S which lie in the same connected component of the corresponding group of diffeomorphisms.
