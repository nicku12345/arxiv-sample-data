In this letter we investigate some aspects of the noncommutative differential geometry based on derivations of the algebra of endomorphisms of an oriented complex hermitian vector bundle. We relate it, in a natural way, to the geometry of the underlying principal bundle and compute the cohomology of its complex of noncommutative differential forms.
