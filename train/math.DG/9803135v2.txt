Let M= G/\Gamma be a compact nilmanifold endowed with an invariant complex structure. We prove that, on an open set of any connected component of the moduli space {\cal C} ({\frak g}) of invariant complex structures on M, the Dolbeault cohomology of M is isomorphic to the one of the differential bigraded algebra associated to the complexification \cg^\C of the Lie algebra of G. To obtain this result, we first prove the above isomorphism for compact nilmanifolds endowed with a rational invariant complex structure. This is done using a descending series associated to the complex structure and the Borel spectral sequences for the corresponding set of holomorphic fibrations. Then we apply the theory of Kodaira-Spencer for deformations of complex structures.
