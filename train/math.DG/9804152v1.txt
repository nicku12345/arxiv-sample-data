This paper constructs a Hodge theory of noncompact topologically tame manifolds M. The main result is an isomorphism between the de Rham cohomology with compact supports of M and the kernel of the Hodge--Witten--Bismut Laplacian \lap_\mu associated to a measure d\mu which has sufficiently rapid growth at infinity on M. This follows from the construction of a space of forms associated to \lap_\mu which satisfy an ``extension by zero'' property. The ``extension by zero'' property is proved for manifolds with cylindrical ends possessing gaussian growth measures.
