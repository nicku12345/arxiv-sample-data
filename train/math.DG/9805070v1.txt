The L^2-torsion is an invariant defined for compact L^2-acyclic manifolds of determinant class, for example odd dimensional hyperbolic manifolds. It was introduced by John Lott and Varghese Mathai and computed for hyperbolic manifolds in low dimensions.   In this paper we show that the L^2-torsion of hyperbolic manifolds of arbitrary odd dimension does not vanish. This was conjectured by J. Lott and W. Lueck.   Some concrete values are computed and an estimate of their growth with the dimension is given.
