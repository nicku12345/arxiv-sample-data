The main results on the theory of conformal and almost Grassmann structures are presented. The common properties of these structures and also the differences between them are outlined. In particular, the structure groups of these structures and their differential prolongations are found. A complete system of geometric objects of the almost Grassmann structure totally defining its geometric structure is determined. The vanishing of these objects determines a locally Grassmann manifold. It is proved that the integrable almost Grassmann structures are locally Grassmann. The criteria of semiintegrability of almost Grassmann structures is proved in invariant form.
