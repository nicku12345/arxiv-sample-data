In this paper we will prove new extrinsic upper bounds for the eigenvalues of the Dirac operator on an isometrically immersed surface M^2 \hookrightarrow {\Bbb R}^3 as well as intrinsic bounds for 2-dimensional compact manifolds of genus zero and genus one. Moreover, we compare the different estimates of the eigenvalue of the Dirac operator for special families of metrics.
