We develop Teichmuller theoretical methods to construct new minimal surfaces in \BE^3 by adding handles and planar ends to existing minimal surfaces in \BE^3. We exhibit this method on an interesting class of minimal surfaces which are likely to be embedded, and have a low degree Gau\ss map for their genus; the (Weierstrass data) period problem for these surfaces is of arbitrary dimension.   In particular, we exhibit a two-parameter family of complete minimal surfaces in the Euclidean three-space \BE^3 which generalize the breakthrough minimal surface of C. Costa; these new surfaces are embedded (at least) outside a compact set, and are indexed (roughly) by the number of ends they have and their genus. They have at most eight self-symmetries despite being of arbitrarily large genus, and are interesting for a number of reasons. Moreover, our methods also extend to prove that some natural candidate classes of surfaces cannot be realized as minimal surfaces in \BE^3. As a result of both aspects of this work, we obtain a classification of a family of surfaces as either realizable or unrealizable as minimal surfaces.
