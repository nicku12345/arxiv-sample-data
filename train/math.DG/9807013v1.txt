It is proved that the geometry of lightlike hypersurfaces of the de Sitter space S^{n+1}_1 is directly connected with the geometry of hypersurfaces of the conformal space C^n. This connection is applied for a construction of an invariant normalization and an invariant affine connection of lightlike hypersurfaces as well as for studying singularities of lightlike hypersurfaces.
