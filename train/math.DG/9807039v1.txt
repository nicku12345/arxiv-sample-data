We construct a new class of complete constant mean curvature surfaces in R^3. These are geometrically different than the surfaces constructed by Kapouleas' gluing technique. These are obtained by piecing together half-Delaunay surfaces to the truncations of minimal k-noids. The gluing techniques are new: the surfaces are obtained by matching Cauchy data from the infinite dimensional family of exact solutions of the problem on each of the component pieces. These surfaces are also proved to be nondegenerate in the CMC moduli space.
