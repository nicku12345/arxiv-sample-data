We introduce a 1-cocycle on the group of diffeomorphisms Diff(M) of a smooth manifold M endowed with a projective connection. This cocycle represents a nontrivial cohomology class of \Diff(M) related to the Diff(M)-modules of second order linear differential operators on M. In the one-dimensional case, this cocycle coincides with the Schwarzian derivative, while, in the multi-dimensional case, it represents its natural and new generalization. This work is a continuation of \cite{bo} where the same problems have been treated in one-dimensional case.
