Goresky, Kottwitz and MacPherson have recently shown that the computation of the equivariant cohomology ring of a G-manifold can be reduced to a computation in graph theory. This opens up the possibility that many of the fundamental theorems in equivariant de Rham theory may, on closer inspection, turn out simply to be theorems about graphs. In this paper we show that for some familiar theorems, this is indeed the case.
