Various transformations of isothermic surfaces are discussed and their interrelations are analyzed. Applications to cmc-1 surfaces in hyperbolic space and their minimal cousins in Euclidean space are presented: the Umehara-Yamada perturbation, the classical and Bryant's Weierstrass type representations, and the duality for cmc-1 surfaces are interpreted in terms of transformations of isothermic surfaces. A new Weierstrass type representation is introduced and a Moebius geometric characterization of cmc-1 surfaces in hyperbolic space and minimal surfaces in Euclidean space is given.
