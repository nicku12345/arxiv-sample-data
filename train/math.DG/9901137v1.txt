It is shown that every bundle \varSigma\to M of complex spinor modules over the Clifford bundle \Cl(g) of a Riemannian space (M,g) with local model (V,h) is associated with an lpin ("Lipschitz") structure on M, this being a reduction of the {\Ort}(h)-bundle of all orthonormal frames on M to the Lipschitz group \Lpin(h) of all automorphisms of a suitably defined spin space. An explicit construction is given of the total space of the \Lpin(h)-bundle defining such a structure. If the dimension m of M is even, then the Lipschitz group coincides with the complex Clifford group and the lpin structure can be reduced to a pin^{c} structure. If m=2n-1, then a spinor module \varSigma on M is of the Cartan type: its fibres are 2^n-dimensional and decomposable at every point of M, but the homomorphism of bundles of algebras \Cl(g)\to\End\varSigma globally decomposes if, and only if, M is orientable. Examples of such bundles are given. The topological condition for the existence of an lpin structure on an odd-dimensional Riemannian manifold is derived and illustrated by the example of a manifold admitting such a structure, but no pin^c structure.
