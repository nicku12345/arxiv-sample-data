A subset S of a Riemannian manifold N is called extrinsically homogeneous if S is an orbit of a subgroup of the isometry group of N. Thorbergsson proved the remarkable result that every complete, connected, full, irreducible isoparametric submanifold of a finite dimensional Euclidean space of rank at least 3 is extrinsically homogeneous. This result, combined with results of Palais-Terng and Dadok, finally classified irreducible isoparametric submanifolds of a finite dimensional Euclidean space of rank at least 3. While Thorbergsson's proof used Tits buildings, a simpler proof without using Tits buildings was given by Olmos. The main purpose of this paper is to extend Thorbergsson's result to the infinite dimensional case.
