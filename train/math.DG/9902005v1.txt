We consider the Dolbeault operator of K^{1/2} -- the square root of the canonical line bundle which determines the spin structure of a compact Hermitian spin surface (M,g,J). We prove that the Dolbeault cohomology groups of K^{1/2} vanish if the scalar curvature of g is non-negative and non-identically zero. Moreover, we estimate the first eigenvalue of the Dolbeault operator when the conformal scalar curvature k is non-negative and when k is positive. In the first case we give a complete list of limiting manifolds and in the second one we give non-K\"ahler examples of limiting manifolds.
