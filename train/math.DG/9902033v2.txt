We prove the vanishing of the first Betti number on compact manifolds admitting a Weyl structure whose Ricci tensor satisfies certain positivity conditions, thus obtaining a Bochner-type vanishing theorem in Weyl geometry. We also study compact Hermitian-Weyl manifolds with non-negative symmetric part of the Ricci tensor of the canonical Weyl connection and show that every such manifold has first Betti number b_1 =1 and Hodge numbers h^{p,0} =0 for p>0, h^{0,1} =1, h^{0,q} =0 for q>1.
