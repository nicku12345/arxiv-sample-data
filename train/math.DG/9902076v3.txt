I point out some very elementary examples of special Lagrangian tori in certain Calabi-Yau manifolds that occur as hypersurfaces in complex projective space. All of these are constructed as real slices of smooth hypersurfaces defined over the reals. This method of constructing special Lagrangian submanifolds is well known. What does not appear to be in the current literature is an explicit description of such examples in which the special Lagrangian submanifold is a 3-torus.
