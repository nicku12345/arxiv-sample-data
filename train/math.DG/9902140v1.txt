The authors study the geometry of lightlike hypersurfaces on a four-dimensional manifold (M, c) endowed with a pseudoconformal structure c = CO (2, 2). They prove that a lightlike hypersurface V \subset (M, c) bears a foliation formed by conformally invariant isotropic geodesics and two isotropic distributions tangent to these geodesics, and that these two distributions are integrable if and only if V is totally umbilical. The authors also indicate how, using singular points and singular submanifolds of a lightlike hypersurface V \subset (M, c), to construct an invariant normalization of V intrinsically connected with V.
