The one-skeleton of a G-manifold M is the set of points p in M where \dim G_p \geq \dim G -1; and M is a GKM manifold if the dimension of this one-skeleton is 2. Goresky, Kottwitz and MacPherson show that for such a manifold this one-skeleton has the structure of a ``labeled" graph, (\Gamma, \alpha), and that the equivariant cohomology ring of M is isomorphic to the ``cohomology ring'' of this graph. Hence, if M is symplectic, one can show that this ring is a free module over the symmetric algebra \SS(\fg^*), with b_{2i}(\Gamma) generators in dimension 2i, b_{2i}(\Gamma) being the ``combinatorial'' 2i-th Betti number of \Gamma. In this article we show that this ``topological'' result is , in fact, a combinatorial result about graphs.
