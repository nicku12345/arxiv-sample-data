Lower bounds on Ricci curvature limit the volumes of sets and the existence of harmonic functions on Riemannian manifolds. In 1975, Shing Tung Yau proved that a complete noncompact manifold with nonnegative Ricci curvature has no nonconstant harmonic functions of sublinear growth. In the same paper, Yau used this result to prove that a complete noncompact manifold with nonnegative Ricci curvature has at least linear volume growth. In this paper, we prove the following theorem concerning harmonic functions on these manifolds.   Theorem: Let M be a complete noncompact manifold with nonnegative Ricci curvature and at most linear volume growth. If there exists a nonconstant harmonic function, f, of polynomial growth of any given degree q, then the manifold splits isometrically, M= N x R.
