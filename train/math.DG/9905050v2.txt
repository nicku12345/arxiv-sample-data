We determine the Seiberg-Witten-Floer homology groups of the three-manifold which is the product of a surface of genus g \geq 1 times the circle, together with its ring structure, for spin-c structures which are non-trivial on the three-manifold. We give applications to computing Seiberg-Witten invariants of four-manifolds which are connected sums along surfaces and also we reprove the higher type adjunction inequalities previously obtained by Oszv\'ath and Szab\'o.
