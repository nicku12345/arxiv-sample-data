We construct exact solutions of the Einstein-Dirac equation, which couples the gravitational field with an eigenspinor of the Dirac operator via the energy-momentum tensor. For this purpose we introduce a new field equation generalizing the notion of Killing spinors. The solutions of this spinorial field equation are called weak Killing spinors (WK-spinors). They are special solutions of the Einstein-Dirac equation and in dimension n=3 the two equations essentially coincide. It turns out that any Sasakian manifold with Ricci tensor related in some special way to the metric tensor as well as to the contact structure admits a WK-spinor. This result is a consequence of the investigation of special spinorial field equations on Sasakian manifolds (Sasakian quasi-Killing spinors). Altogether, in odd dimensions a contact geometry generates a solution of the Einstein-Dirac equation. Moreover, we prove the existence of solutions of the Einstein-Dirac equations that are not WK-spinors in all dimensions n > 8.
