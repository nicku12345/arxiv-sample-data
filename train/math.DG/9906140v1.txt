Spinor fields on surfaces of revolution conformally immersed into 3-dimensional space are considered in the framework of the spinor representations of surfaces. It is shown that a linear problem (a 2-dimensional Dirac equation) related with a modified Veselov- Novikov hierarchy in the case of the surface of revolution reduces to a well-known Zakharov-Shabat system. In the case of one-soliton solution an explicit form of the spinor fields is given by means of linear Bargmann potentials and is expressed via the Jost functions of the Zakharov-Shabat system. It is shown also that integrable deformations of the spinor fields on the surface of revolution are defined by a modified Korteweg-de Vries hierarchy.
