The subgroups of GL(n,R) that act irreducibly on R^n and that can occur as the holonomy of a torsion-free affine connection on an n-manifold are classified, thus completing the work on this subject begun by M. Berger in the 1950s. The methods employed include representation theory, the theory of hermitian symmetric spaces, twistor theory, and Poisson geometry. The latter theory is especially important for the construction and classification of those torsion-free connections whose holonomy falls into one of the so-called `exotic' cases, i.e., those that were not included in Berger's original lists. Some remarks involving an interpretation of some of the examples in terms of supersymmetric constructions are also included.
