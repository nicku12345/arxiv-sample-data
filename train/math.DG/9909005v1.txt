We study Lagrangian subalgebras of a semisimple Lie algebra with respect to the imaginary part of the Killing form. We show that the variety \Lagr of Lagrangian subalgebras carries a natural Poisson structure \Pi. We determine the irreducible components of \Lagr, and we show that each irreducible component is a smooth fiber bundle over a generalized flag variety, and that the fiber is the product of the real points of a De Concini-Procesi compactification and a compact homogeneous space. We study some properties of the Poisson structure \Pi and show that it contains many interesting Poisson submanifolds.
