It has recently been conjectured that the eigenvalues \lambda of the Dirac operator on a closed Riemannian spin manifold M of dimension n\ge 3 can be estimated from below by the total scalar curvature:  \lambda^2 \ge \frac{n}{4(n-1)} \cdot \frac{\int_M S}{vol(M)}.  We show by example that such an estimate is impossible.
