A new technique for the study of geodesic connectedness in a class of Lorentzian manifolds is introduced. It is based on arguments of Brouwer's topological degree for the solution of functional equations. It is shown to be very useful for multiwarped spacetimes, which include different types of relativistic spacetimes.
