This paper achieves, among other things, the following: 1)It frees the main result of [BFKM] from the hypothesis of determinant class and extends this result from unitary to arbitrary representations. 2)It extends (and at the same times provides a new proof of) the main result of Bismut and Zhang [BZ] from finite dimensional representations of \Gamma to representations on an {\cal A}-Hilbert module of finite type ({\cal A} a finite von Neumann algebra). The result of [BZ] corresponds to {\cal A}=\bbc. 3)It provides interesting real valued functions on the space of representations of the fundamental group \Gamma of a closed manifold M. These functions might be a useful source of topological and geometric invariants of M. These objectives are achieved with the help of the relative torsion \cal R , first introduced by Carey, Mathai and Mishchenko [CMM] in special cases. The main result of this paper calculates explicitly this relative torsion (cf Theorem 0.1).
