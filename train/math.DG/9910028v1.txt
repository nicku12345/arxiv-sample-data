For any closed complex manifold X, we calculate the Poincar\'{e} and Hodge polynomials of the delocalized equivariant cohomology H^*(X^n, S_n) with a grading specified by physicists. As a consequence, we recover a special case of a formula for the elliptic genera of symmetric products in Dijkgraaf-Moore-Verlinde-Verlinde \cite{Dij-Moo-Ver-Ver}. For a projective surface X, our results matches with the corresponding formulas for the Hilbert scheme of X^[n]. We also give geometric construction of an action of a Heisenberg superalgebra on \sum_{n \geq 0} H^{*,*}(X^n, S_n), imitating the constructions for equivariant K-theory by Segal \cite{Seg} and Wang \cite{Wan}. There is a corresponding version for H^{-*, *}.
