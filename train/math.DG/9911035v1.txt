In LM, we proved a family version of the famous Witten rigidity theorems and several family vanishing theorems for elliptic genera. In this paper, we gerenalize our theorems LM in two directions. First we establish a family rigidity theorem for the Dirac operator on loop space twisted by general positive energy loop group representations. Second we prove a family rigidity theorem for spin^c-manifolds. Several vanishing theorems on both cases are also obtained.
