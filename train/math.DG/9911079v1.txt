We prove that any simply connected special Kaehler manifold admits a canonical immersion as a parabolic affine hypersphere. As an application, we associate a parabolic affine hypersphere to any nondegenerate holomorphic function. Also we show that a classical result of Calabi and Pogorelov on parabolic spheres implies Lu's theorem on complete special Kaehler manifolds with a positive definite metric.
