This text is dedicated to the real Killing equation on 3-dimensional Weyl manifolds. Any manifold admitting a real Killing spinor of weight 0 satisfies the conditions of a Gauduchon-Tod geometry. Conversely, any simply connected Gauduchon-Tod geometry has a 2-dimensional space of solutions of the real Killing equation on the spinor bundle of weight 0.
