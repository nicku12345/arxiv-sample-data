In this paper we introduce the notion of degree for C^1-cocycles over irrational rotations on the circle with values in the group SU(2). It is shown that if a C^1-cocycle \phi:S^1\to SU(2) over an irrational rotation by \alpha has nonzero degree, then the skew product S^1\times SU(2)\ni(x,g)\mapsto (x+\alpha,g\phi(x))\in S^1\times SU(2) is not ergodic and the group of essential values of \phi is equal to the maximal Abelian subgroup of SU(2). Moreover, if \phi is of class C^2 (with some additional assumptions) the Lebesgue component in the spectrum of the skew product has countable multiplicity. Possible values of degree are discussed, too.
