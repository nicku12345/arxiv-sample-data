In applications of centre manifold theory we need more flexible error estimates than that provided by, for example, the Approximation Theorem~3 by Carr (1981,1983). Here we extend the theory to cover the case where the order of approximation in parameters and that in dynamical variables may be completely different. This allows, for example, the effective evaluation of low-dimensional dynamical models at finite parameter values.
