We show that for the C^1-open set of partially hyperbolic diffeomorphisms constructed in (M. Shub and A. Wilkinson, "Pathological foliations and removable zero exponents," Invent. math. 139 (2000) 3, 495-508), Lebesgue measure on the 3-torus decomposes as atomic measure along the leaves of the central foliation.
