The paper introduces a new numerical characteristic of one dimensional stochastic systems. This quantity is a measure of minimal periodicity, can be detected in the process deep differential structure. The claim is that this new measure of stochasticity is also a well adapted characteristic for research of stochastic resonance phenomena.
