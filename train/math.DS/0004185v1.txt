We consider the class of autonomous systems \dot x=f(x), where x \in {\bf R}^{2n}, f \in C^1({\bf R}^{2n}) whose phase portrait is a Cartesian product of n two-dimensional {\em centres}. We also consider perturbations of this system, namely \dot x=f(x)+g(t,x), where g \in C^1({\bf R}\times{\bf R}^{2n}) and g is asymptotically small, that is g\Rightarrow 0 as t\to +\infty uniformly with respect to x. The rate of decrease of g is assumed to be t^{-p} where p>1. We prove under this conditions the existence of bounded solutions of the perturbed system and discuss their convergence to solutions of the unperturbed system. This convergence depends on p. Moreover, we show that the original unperturbed system may be reduced to the form \dot r=0, \dot\theta=A(r), and taking r\in {\bf R}^m_{+}, \theta\in {\bf T}^n, where {\bf T}^n denotes the n-dimensional torus, we investigate the more general case of systems whose phase portrait is foliated on invariant tori. We notice that integrable Hamiltonian systems are of the same nature. We give also several examples, showing that the conditions of our theorems cannot be improved.
