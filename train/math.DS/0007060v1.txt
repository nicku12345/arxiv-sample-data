Section 1 refines the theory of harmonic and potential maps. Section 2 defines a generalized Lorentz world-force law and shows that any PDEs system of order one generates such a law in suitable geometrical structure. In other words, the solutions of any PDEs system of order one are harmonic or potential maps, if we use semi-Riemann-Lagrange structures. Section 3 formulates open problems regarding the geometry of semi-Riemann manifolds (J^1(T,M), S_1), (J^2(T,M), S_2), and shows that the Lorentz-Udriste world-force law is equivalent to covariant Hamilton PDEs on (J^1(T,M), S_1).
