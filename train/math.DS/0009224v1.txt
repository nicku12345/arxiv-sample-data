Let \phi^t be a continuous flow on a metric space X and I be an isolated invariant set with an index pair (N,L) and a Morse decomposition \{M_i\}^n_{i=1}. For every category \nu on N/L, we prove that \nu(N/L)\leq \nu([L])+\sum_{i=1}^n \nu(M_i). As a result if \phi^t|_I is gradient-like and X is semi-locally contractible, then \phi^t has at least \nu_H(h(I))-1 rest points in I where h(I) is the Conley index of I and \nu_H is the Homotopy Lusternik-Schnirelmann category.
