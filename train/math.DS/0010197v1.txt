We consider systems of ordinary differential equations with quadratic homogeneous right hand side. We give a new simple proof of a result already obtained in [8,10] which gives the necessary conditions for the existence of polynomial first integrals. The necessary conditions for the existence of a polynomial symmetry field are given. It is proved that an arbitrary homogeneous first integral of a given degree is a linear combination of a fixed set of polynomials.
