We consider open sets of maps in a manifold M exhibiting non-uniform expanding behaviour in some domain S\subset M. Assuming that there is a forward invariant region containing S where each map has a unique SRB measure, we prove that under general uniformity conditions, the SRB measure varies continuously in the L^1-norm with the map. As a main application we show that the open class of maps introduced in [V] fits to this situation, thus proving that the SRB measures constructed in [A] vary continuously with the map.
