The classical representation of Hamiltonian systems in terms of action-angle variables are defined for simply connected domains such as an interior of a homoclinic orbit. On this basis methods of (local) perturbations leading, in particular, to chaotic systems have been studied in literature.   We are describing a new method for constructing global action-angle variables and successive perturbations based on a topological covering of the phase space. The method is demonstrated for representative example of the Duffing system.
