It is well known that the Lorenz system has Z_2-symmetry. Using introducted in math.DS/0105147 topological covering-coloring a new representation for the Lorenz system is obtained. Deleting coloring leads to the factorized Lorenz system that is in a sense more fundamental than the original one. Finally, Z_n extensions define a class of Lorenz-type systems. The approach admits a natural generalization for regular and chaotic systems with arbitrary symmetries.
