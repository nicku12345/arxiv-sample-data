We consider quasisymmetric reparametrizations of the parameter space of the quadratic family. We prove that the set of quadratic maps which are either regular or Collet-Eckmann with polynomial recurrence of the critical orbit has full Lebesgue measure.   (The intent of this work is just to be a rigorous reference for the companion preprint Statistical properties of unimodal maps: smooth families with negative Schwarzian derivative. It is based on the LaTeX file of the paper Statistical properties of unimodal maps: the quadratic family. The proofs are very similar and in many places differ just by change of constants.)
