We study the behavior of diffeomorphisms, contained in the closure \bar {\A_\a} (in the inductive limit topology) of the set \A_\a of real-analytic diffeomorphisms of the torus \Bbb T^2, conjugated to the rotation R_\a:(x,y)\mapsto (x + \a, y) by an analytic measure-preserving transformation. We show that for a generic \a\in [0,1], \bar {\A_\a} contains a dense set of uniquely ergodic diffeomorphisms. We also prove that \bar {\A_\a} contains a dense set of diffeomorphisms that are minimal and non-ergodic.
