This self-contained paper is part of a series \cite{FF2,FF3} on actions by diffeomorphisms of infinite groups on compact manifolds. The two main results presented here are:   1) Any homomorphism of (almost any) mapping class group or automorphism group of a free group into \Diff_+^r(S^1), r\geq 2 is trivial. For r=0 Nielsen showed that in many cases nontrivial (even faithful) representations exist. Somewhat weaker results are proven for finite index subgroups.   2) We construct a finitely-presented group of real-analytic diffeomorphisms of \R which is not residually finite.
