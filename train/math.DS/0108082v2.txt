Let M be a monoid (e.g. the lattice Z^D), and A an abelian group. A^M is then a compact abelian group; a linear cellular automaton (LCA) is a continuous endomorphism F:A^M --> A^M that commutes with all shift maps.   Let mu be a (possibly nonstationary) probability measure on A^M; we develop sufficient conditions on mu and F so that the sequence {F^N mu} (N=1,2,3,...) weak*-converges to the Haar measure on A^M, in density (and thus, in Cesaro average as well). As an application, we show: if A=Z/p (p prime), F is any ``nontrivial'' LCA on A^{(Z^D)}, and mu belongs to a broad class of measures (including most Bernoulli measures (for D >= 1) and ``fully supported'' N-step Markov measures (when D=1), then F^N mu weak*-converges to Haar measure in density.
