If M is a monoid (e.g. the lattice Z^D), and G is a finite (nonabelian) group, then G^M is a compact group; a `multiplicative cellular automaton' (MCA) is a continuous transformation F:G^M-->G^M which commutes with all shift maps, and where nearby coordinates are combined using the multiplication operation of G.   We characterize when MCA are group endomorphisms of G^M, and show that MCA on G^M inherit a natural structure theory from the structure of G. We apply this structure theory to compute the measurable entropy of MCA, and to study convergence of initial measures to Haar measure.
