Let M be a four-holed sphere and \Gamma the mapping class group of M fixing \partial M. The group \Gamma acts on the space {\mathcal M}_{\mathcal B}(SU(2)) of SU(2)-gauge equivalence classes of flat SU(2)-connections on M with fixed holonomy on \partial M. We give examples of flat SU(2)-connections whose holonomy groups are dense in SU(2), but whose \Gamma-orbits are discrete in {\mathcal M}_{\mathcal B}(SU(2)). This phenomenon does not occur for surfaces with genus greater than zero.
