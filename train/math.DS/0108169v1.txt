Asymptotic quadratic growth rates of saddle connections and families of periodic cylinders on translation tori with n marked points are studied. For any marking the existence of limits of the quadratic growth rate is shown using elementary methods (not Ratners theorem). We study the growth rate limit as function of the marking. We give precise formulas for this function in the case of two marked points and describe the sets where the growth function is maximal and continuous in any case. For rational two markings we calculate the index of the Veech group in SL(2,Z) using two different ways.
