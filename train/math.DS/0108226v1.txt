We prove that homoclinic classes for a residual set of C^1 vector fields X on closed n-manifolds are maximal transitive and depend continuously on periodic orbit data. In addition, X does not exhibit cycles formed by homoclinic classes. We also prove that a homoclinic class of X is isolated if and only if it is Omega-isolated, and that it is the intersection of its stable set and its unstable set. All these properties are well known for structurally stable Axiom A vector fields.
