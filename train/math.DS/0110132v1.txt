An effective version of Bautin's theory with explicit estimates on the size of the neighborhood on which the number of limit cycles is controlled is given here for the case of Lienard Systems. The Bautin ideal is computed and the conjecture of W. de Melo-A. Lins Neto-C.C. Pugh is checked at any order of the perturbation.
