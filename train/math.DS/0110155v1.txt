We prove that if the multipliers of the repelling periodic orbits of a complex polynomial grow at least like n^{5 + \epsilon}, for some \epsilon > 0, then the Julia set of the polynomial is locally connected when it is connected.   As a consequence for a polynomial the presence of a Cremer cycle implies the presence of a sequence of repelling periodic orbits with "small" multipliers.   Somehow surprinsingly the proof is based in measure theorical considerations.
