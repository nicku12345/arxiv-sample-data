We study the behaviour of sequences of blowing-ups under ramifications, and use the results to give a simple proof of Camacho-Sad's Theorem on the existence of Separatrices for singularities of plane holomorphic foliations. The main result we prove is that for any finite sequence \pi of blowing-ups, there is a ramification morphism \rho such that the elimination of indeterminations \tilde{\pi} of \pi^{-1}\circ \rho is a sequence of blowing-ups \emph{with centers at regular points of the exceptional divisors}; moreover, we show that if \pi is the reduction of singularities of a foliation \mathcal{F}, then \rho can be such that \tilde{\pi}^{\star}\rho^{\star}\mathcal{F} has only simple singularities.
