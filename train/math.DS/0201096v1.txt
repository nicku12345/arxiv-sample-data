This paper addresses the question of genericity of existence of elliptic islands for the billiard map associated to strictly convex closed curves. More precisely, we study 2-periodic orbits of billiards associated to C5 closed and strictly convex curves and show that the existence of elliptic islands is a dense property on the subset of those billiards having an elliptic 2-periodic point. Our main tools are normal perturbations, the Birkhoff Normal Form for elliptic fixed points and Moser's Twist Theorem.
