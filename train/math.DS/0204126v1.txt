Each topological group G admits a unique universal minimal dynamical system (M(G),G). When G is a non-compact locally compact group the phase space M(G) of this universal system is non-metrizable. There are however topological groups for which M(G) is the trivial one point system (extremely amenable groups), as well as topological groups G for which M(G) is a metrizable space and for which there is an explicit description of the dynamical system (M(G),G). One such group is the topological group S_\infty of all permutations of the integers {\mathbb Z}, with the topology of pointwise convergence. We show that (M(S_\infty),S_\infty) is a symbolic dynamical system (hence in particular M(S_\infty) is a Cantor set), and give a full description of all its symbolic factors. Among other facts we show that (M(G),G) (and hence also every minimal S_\infty) has the structure of a two-to-one group extension of proximal system and that it is uniquely ergodic.
