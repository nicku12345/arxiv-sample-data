The exact order of mixing for zero-dimensional algebraic dynamical systems is not entirely understood. Here non-Archimedean norms in function fields of positive characteristic are used to exhibit an asymptotic shape in non-mixing sequences for algebraic Z^2-actions. This gives a relationship between the order of mixing and the convex hull of the defining polynomial. Using these methods, we show that an algebraic dynamical system for which any shape of cardinality three is mixing is mixing of order three, and for any k\ge1 exhibit examples that are k-fold mixing but not (k+1)-fold mixing.
