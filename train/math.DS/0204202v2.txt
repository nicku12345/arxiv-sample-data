We discuss some techniques related to equivariant compactifications of uniform spaces and amenability of topological groups. In particular, we give a new proof of a recent result by Glasner and Weiss describing the universal minimal flow of the infinite symmetric group {\mathfrak S}_\infty with the standard Polish topology, and extend Bekka's concept of an amenable representation, enabling one to deduce non-amenability of the Banach--Lie groups \GL(L_p) and \GL(\ell_p), 1\leq p <\infty.
