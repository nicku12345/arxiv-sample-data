We show stable ergodicity of a class of conservative diffeomorphisms which do not have any hyperbolic invariant subbundle. Moreover the uniqueness of SRB measures for non-conservative C^1 perturbations of such diffeomorphisms. This class contains strictly non-partially hyperbolic robustly transitive diffeomorphisms by Bonatti-Viana and so we answer their question about the stable ergodicity of such systems.
