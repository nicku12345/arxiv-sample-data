If M is a compact or convex-cocompact negatively curved manifold, we associate to any Gibbs measure on \tm a quasi-invariant transverse measure for the horospherical foliation, and prove that this measure is uniquely determined by its Radon-Nikodym cocycle. (This extends the Bowen-Marcus unique ergodicity result for this foliation.) We shall also prove equidistribution properties for the leaves of the foliation w.r.t. these Gibbs measures. We use these results in the study of invaiant meausres for horospherical foliations on regular covers of M.
