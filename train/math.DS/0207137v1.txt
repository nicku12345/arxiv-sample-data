We investigate rigidity of measurable structure for higher rank abelian algebraic actions. In particular, we show that ergodic measures for these actions fiber over a 0 entropy measure with Haar measures along the leaves. We deduce various rigidity theorems for isomorphisms and joinings as corollaries.
