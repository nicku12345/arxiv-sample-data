Point vortices on a cylinder (periodic strip) are studied geometrically. The Hamiltonian formalism is developed, a non-existence theorem for relative equilibria is proved, equilibria are classified when all vorticities have the same sign, and several results on relative periodic orbits are established, including as corollaries classical results on vortex streets and leapfrogging.
