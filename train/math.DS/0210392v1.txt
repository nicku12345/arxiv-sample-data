In this work, under a mild assumption, we give the classification of the complete polynomial vector fields in two variables up to algebraic automorphisms of \C^2. The general problem is also reduced to the study of the combinatorics of certain resolutions of singularities. Whereas we deal with \C-complete vector fields, our results also apply to \R-complete ones thanks to a theorem of Forstneric \cite{forst}.
