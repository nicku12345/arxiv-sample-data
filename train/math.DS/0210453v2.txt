We consider a family of scalar delay differential equations x'(t)=f(t,x_t), with a nonlinearity f satisfying a negative feedback condition combined with a boundedness condition. We present a global stability criterion for this family, which in particular unifies the celebrated 3/2-conditions given for the Yorke and the Wright type equations. We illustrate our results with some applications.
