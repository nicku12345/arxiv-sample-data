In the setting of abstract Markov maps, we prove results concerning the convergence of renormalized Birkhoff sums to normal laws or stable laws. They apply to one-dimensional maps with a neutral fixed point at 0 of the form x+x^{1+\alpha}, for \alpha\in (0,1). In particular, for \alpha>1/2, we show that the Birkhoff sums of a H\"older observable f converge to a normal law or a stable law, depending on whether f(0)=0 or f(0)\not=0. The proof uses spectral techniques introduced by Sarig, and Wiener's Lemma in noncommutative Banach algebras.
