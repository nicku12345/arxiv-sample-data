We study the dynamics of polynomial-like mappings in several variables. A special case of our results is the following theorem. Let f be a proper holomorphic map from an open set U onto a Stein manifold V, U\subset\subset V. Assume f is of topological degree d_t>1. Then there is a probability measure \mu supported on \bigcap_{n\geq 0}f^{-n}(V) satisfying the following properties. 1. The measure \mu is invariant, K-mixing, of maximal entropy \log d_t. 2. If J is the Jacobian of f with respect to a volume form then \int \log J \d \mu \geq \log d_t. 3. For every probability measure \nu on V with no mass on pluripolar sets d_t^{-n} (f^n)^*\nu converges to \mu. 4. If the p.s.h. functions on V are \mu-integrables (\mu is PLB) then (a) The Lyapounov exponents for \mu are strictly positive. (b) \mu is exponentially mixing. (c) There is a proper analytic subset E of V such that for z\not\in\E, \mu^z_n:=d_t^{-n} (f^n)^*\delta_z converges to \mu. (d) The measure \mu is a limit of Dirac masses on the repelling periodic points. The condition \mu is PLB is stable under small pertubation of f. This gives large families where it is satisfied.
