Let P(x) be a real polynomial of degree 2g+1, H=y^2+P(x) and \delta(h) be an oval contained in the level set \{H=h\}. We study complete Abelian integrals of the form I(h)=\int_{\delta(h)} \frac{(\alpha_0+\alpha_1 x+... + \alpha_{g-1}x^{g-1})dx}{y}, h\in \Sigma, where \alpha_i are real and \Sigma\subset \R is a maximal open interval on which a continuous family of ovals \{\delta(h)\} exists. We show that the g-dimensional real vector space of these integrals is not Chebyshev in general: for any g>1, there are hyperelliptic Hamiltonians H and continuous families of ovals \delta(h)\subset\{H=h\}, h\in\Sigma, such that the Abelian integral I(h) can have at least [\frac32g]-1 zeros in \Sigma. Our main result is Theorem \ref{main} in which we show that when g=2, exceptional families of ovals \{\delta(h)\} exist, such that the corresponding vector space is still Chebyshev.
