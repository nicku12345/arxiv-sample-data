The purpose of this paper is to present a weighted kneading theory for unidimensional maps with holes. We consider extensions of the kneading theory of Milnor and Thurston to expanding discontinuous maps with holes and introduce weights in the formal power series. This method allows us to derive techniques to compute explicitly the topological entropy, the Hausdorff dimension and the escape rate.
