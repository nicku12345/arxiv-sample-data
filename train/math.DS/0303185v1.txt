The role of generalized Bowen-Franks groups (BF-groups) as topological conjugacy invariants for \mathbb{T}^{n} automorphisms is studied. Using algebraic number theory, a link is established between equality of BF-groups for different automorphisms (BF-equivalence) and an identical position in a finite lattice (\mathcal{L}-equivalence). Important cases of equivalence of the two conditions are proved. Finally, a topological interpretation of the classical BF-group \mathbb{Z}% ^{n}/\mathbb{Z}^{n}(I-A) in this context is presented.
