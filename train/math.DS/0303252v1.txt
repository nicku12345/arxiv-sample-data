An {\em attractor} is a transitive set of a flow to which all positive orbit close to it converges. An attractor is {\em singular-hyperbolic} if it has singularities (all hyperbolic) and is partially hyperbolic with volume expanding central direction \cite{MPP}. The geometric Lorenz attractor \cite{GW} is an example of a singular-hyperbolic attractor with topological dimension \geq 2. We shall prove that {\em all} singular-hyperbolic attractors on compact 3-manifolds have topological dimension \geq 2. The proof uses the methods in \cite{MP}.
