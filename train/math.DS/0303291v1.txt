We construct an example of a H\"older continuous vector field on the plane which is tangent to all foliations in a continuous family of pairwise distinct C^1 foliations. Given any 1 \le r <\infty, the construction can be done in such a way that each leaf of each foliation is the graph of a C^r function from \R to \R. We also show the existence of a continuous vector field X on \R^2 and two foliations \cal{F} and \cal{G} on \R^2 each tangent to X with a dense subset \cal E of \R^2 such that at every point x\in \cal E the leaves F_x and G_x of the foliation \cal{F} and \cal{G} through x are topologically transverse.
