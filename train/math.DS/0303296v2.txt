The main result of this paper is that every non-trivial Hamiltonian diffeomorphism of a closed oriented surface of genus at least one has periodic points of arbitrarily high period. The same result is true for S^2 provided the diffeomorphism has at least three fixed points. In addition we show that up to isotopy relative to its fixed point set, every orientation preserving diffeomorphism F: S --> S of a closed orientable surface has a normal form. If the fixed point set is finite this is just the Thurston normal form.
