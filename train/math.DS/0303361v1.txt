We prove that action of a semigroup T on compact metric space X by continuous selfmaps is strongly proximal if and only if T action on P(X), the space of probability measures on X with weak topology, is strongly proximal. As a consequence we prove that affine actions on certain compact convex subsets of finite-dimensional vector spaces are strongly proximal if and only if the action is proximal.
