In the moduli space of quadratic differentials over complex structures on a surface, we construct a set of full Hausdorff dimension of points with bounded Teichm\"uller geodesic trajectories.The main tool is quantitative nondivergence of Teichm\"uller horocycles, due to Minsky and Weiss. This has an application to billiards in rational polygons.
