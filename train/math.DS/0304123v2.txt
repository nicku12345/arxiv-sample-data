There is given a construction of the entropy of a dynamical system on arbitrary MV-algebra M. If M is the MV-algebra of characteristic functions of a \sigma-algebra (isomorphic to the \sigma-algebra), then the construction leads to the Kolmogorov - Sinaj entropy. If M is the MV-algebra (tribe) of fuzzy sets, then the construction coincides with the Mali\v{c}k\' y modification of the Kolmogorov - Sinaj entropy for fuzzy sets.
