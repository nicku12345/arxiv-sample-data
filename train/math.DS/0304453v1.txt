Standard bifurcation theory is concerned with families of vector fields dx/dt = f(x,\lambda), x \in \R^n, involving one or several constant real parameters \lambda. Viewed as a differential equation for the pair (x,\lambda), we observe a foliation of the total phase space by constant \lambda. Frequently, the presence of a trivial stationary solution x=0 is also imposed: 0 = f(0,\lambda).   Bifurcation without parameters, in contrast, discards the foliation by a constant parameter \lambda. Instead, we consider systems dx/dt = f(x,y), dy/dt = g(x,y). Standard bifurcation theory then corresponds to the special case y=\lambda, g=0. To preserve only the trivial solution x=0, instead, we only require 0 = f(0,y) = g(0,y) for all y. A rich dynamic phenomenology arises, when normal hyperbolicity of the trivial stationary manifold x=0 fails, due to zero or purely imaginary eigenvalues of the Jacobian f_x(0,y).   Specifically, we address the cases of failure of normal hyperbolicity due to a simple eigenvalue zero, a simple purely imaginary pair (Hopf bifurcation without parameters), a double eigenvalue zero (Takens-Bogdanov bifurcation without parameters), and due to a double eigenvalue zero with additional time reversal symmetries.   The results are joint work with Andrei Afendikov, James C. Alexander, and Stefan Liebscher.
