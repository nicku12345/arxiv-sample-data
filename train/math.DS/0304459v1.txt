The method of continuous averaging can be regarded as a combination of the Lie method, where a change of coordinates is constructed as a shift along solutions of a differential equation and the Neishtadt method, well-known in perturbation theory for ODE in the presence of exponentially small effects. This method turns out to be very effective in the analysis of one- and multi-frequency averaging, exponentially small separatrix splitting and in the problem of an inclusion of an analytic diffeomorphism into an analytic flow. We discuss general features of the method as well as the applications.
