If \a is an irrational number, we let \{p_n/q_n\}_{n\geq 0}, be the approximants given by its continued fraction expansion. The Bruno series B(\a) is defined as B(\a)=\sum_{n\geq 0} \frac{\log q_{n+1}}{q_n}.   The quadratic polynomial P_\a:z\mapsto e^{2i\pi \a}z+z^2 has an indifferent fixed point at the origin. If P_\a is linearizable, we let r(\a) be the conformal radius of the Siegel disk and we set r(\a)=0 otherwise. Yoccoz proved that if B(\a)=\infty, then r(\a)=0 and P_\a is not linearizable. In this article, we present a different proof and we show that there exists a constant C such that for all irrational number \a with B(\a)<\infty, we have B(\a)+\log r(\a) < C. Together with former results of Yoccoz (see \cite{y}), this proves the conjectured boundedness of B(\a)+\log r(\a).
