We introduce subshifts of quasi-finite type as a generalization of the well-known subshifts of finite type. This generalization is much less rigid and therefore contains the symbolic dynamics of many non-uniform systems, e.g., piecewise monotonic maps of the interval with positive entropy. Yet many properties remain: existence of finitely many ergodic invariant probabilities of maximum entropy; lots of periodic points; meromorphic extension of the Artin-Mazur zeta function.
