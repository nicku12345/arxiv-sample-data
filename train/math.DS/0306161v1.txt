A numerical technique used to solve boundary value problems is modified to find periodic steady-state solutions of nonautonomous dynamical systems. The technique uses a matrix representation of the time derivative obtained through trigonometric interpolation of a periodic function. Such a differentiation matrix yields exact values for the derivative of a trigonometric polynomial and therefore, can be used as the main ingredient of a numerical method to solve nonlinear dynamical systems. We apply this technique to obtain some limit cycles and bifurcation points of a sinusoidally driven pendulum and the steady-state response of an electric circuit.
