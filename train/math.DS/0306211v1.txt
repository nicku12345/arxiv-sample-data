A `right-sided, nearest neighbour cellular automaton' (RNNCA) is a continuous transformation F:A^Z-->A^Z determined by a local rule f:A^{0,1}-->A so that, for any a in A^Z and any z in Z, F(a)_z = f(a_{z},a_{z+1}) . We say that F is `bipermutative' if, for any choice of a in A, the map g:A-->A defined by g(b) = f(a,b) is bijective, and also, for any choice of b in A, the map h:A-->A defined by h(a)=f(a,b) is bijective.   We characterize the invariant measures of bipermutative RNNCA. First we introduce the equivalent notion of a `quasigroup CA', to expedite the construction of examples. Then we characterize F-invariant measures when A is a (nonabelian) group, and f(a,b) = a*b. Then we show that, if F is any bipermutative RNNCA, and mu is F-invariant, then F must be mu-almost everywhere K-to-1, for some constant K . We use this to characterize invariant measures when A^Z is a `group shift' and F is an `endomorphic CA'.
