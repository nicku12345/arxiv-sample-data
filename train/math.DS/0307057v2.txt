The symmetric group S_n acts as a reflection group on CP^{n-2} (for n\geq 3) . Associated with each of the \binom{n}{2} transpositions in S_n is an involution on CP^{n-2} that pointwise fixes a hyperplane--the mirrors of the action. For each such action, there is a unique S_n-symmetric holomorphic map of degree n+1 whose critical set is precisely the collection of hyperplanes. Since the map preserves each reflecting hyperplane, the members of this family are critically-finite in a very strong sense. Considerations of symmetry and critical-finiteness produce global dynamical results: each map's fatou set consists of a special finite set of superattracting points whose basins are dense.
