We show that, for a robust (C^2-open) class of random non-uniformly expanding maps, there exists equilibrium states for a large class of potentials.In particular, these sytems have measures of maximal entropy. These results also give a partial answer to a question posed by Liu-Zhao. The proof of the main result uses an extension of techniques in recent works by Alves-Ara\'ujo, Alves-Bonatti-Viana and Oliveira.
