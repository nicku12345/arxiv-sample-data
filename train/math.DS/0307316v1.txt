We study the omega-limit sets \omega_X(x) in an isolating block U of a singular-hyperbolic attractor for three-dimensional vector fields X. We prove that for every vector field Y close to X the set  \{x\in U:\omega_Y(x) contains a singularity\} is {\em residual} in U. This is used to prove the persistence of singular-hyperbolic attractors with only one singularity as chain-transitive Lyapunov stable sets. These results generalize well known properties of the geometric Lorenz attractor \cite{gw} and the example in \cite{mpu}.
