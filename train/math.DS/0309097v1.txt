An extension of the classic Enneper-Weierstrass representation for conformally parametrised surfaces in multi-dimensional spaces is presented. This is based on low dimensional CP^1 and CP^2 sigma models which allow the study of the constant mean curvature (CMC) surfaces immersed into Euclidean 3- and 8-dimensional spaces, respectively. Relations of Weierstrass type systems to the equations of these sigma models are established. In particular, it is demonstrated that the generalised Weierstrass representation can admit different CMC-surfaces in R^3 which have globally the same Gauss map. A new procedure for constructing CMC-surfaces in R^n is presented and illustrated in some explicit examples.
