For Young systems, i.e. for hyperbolic systems without/with singularities satisfying Lai-Sang Young's axioms (which imply exponential decay of correlation and the CLT) a local CLT is proven. In fact, a unified version of the local CLT is found, covering among others the absolutely contionuous and the arithmetic cases. For the planar Lorentz process with a finite horizon this result implies a.) the local CLT and b.) the recurrence. For the latter case (d=2, finite horizon), combining the global CLT with abstract ergodic theoretic ideas, K. Schmidt, and J.-P. Conze, could already establish recurrence.
