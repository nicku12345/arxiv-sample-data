Let \Gamma be a lattice in G=SL(n,R) and X=G/S a homogeneous space of G, where S is a closed subgroup of G which contains a real algebraic subgroup H such that G/H is compact. We establish uniform distribution of orbits of \Gamma in X analogous to the classical equidistribution on torus. To obtain this result, we first prove an ergodic theorem along balls in the connected component of Borel subgroup of G.
