The definition of principal nest is supplemented with a system of frames that make possible the classification of combinatorial types for every level of the nest. As a consequence, we give necessary and sufficient conditions for the admissibility of a type and prove that given a sequence of non-renormalizable finite admissible types, there is a quadratic polynomial whose nest realizes the sequence.
