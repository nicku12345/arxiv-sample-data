Let (X, \mathcal{B}, \mu) be a probability measure space and T_1, T_2, T_3 three not necessarily commuting measure preserving transformations on (X, \mathcal{B}, \mu). We prove that for all bounded functions f_1, f_2, f_3 the averages \frac{1}{N^2}\sum_{n, m =1}^N f_1(T_1^nx)f_2(T_2^mx)f_3(T_3^{n+m}x) converges a.e. Generalizations to averages of 2^k -1 functions are also given for not necessarily commuting weakly mixing systems.
