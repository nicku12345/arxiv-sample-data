Let M be a four-holed sphere and \Gamma the mapping class group of M fixing the boundary \partial M. The group \Gamma acts on M_B(SL(2,C)) = Hom_B^+(pi_1(M),SL(2,C))/SL(2,C) which is the space of completely reducible SL(2,C)-gauge equivalence classes of flat SL(2,C)-connections on M with fixed holonomy B on \partial M. Let B \in (-2,2)^4 and M_B be the compact component of the real points of M_B(SL(2,C)). These points correspond to SU(2)-representations or SL(2,R)-representations. The \Gamma-action preserves M_B and we study the topological dynamics of the \Gamma-action on M_B and show that for a dense set of holonomy B \in (-2,2)^4, the \Gamma-orbits are dense in M_B. We also produce a class of representations \rho \in \Hom_B^+(pi_1(M),SL(2,R)) such that the \Gamma-orbit of [\rho] is finite in the compact component of M_B(SL(2,R)), but \rho(\pi_1(M)) is dense in SL(2,R).
