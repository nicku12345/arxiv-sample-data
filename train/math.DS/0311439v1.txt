We consider families of transformations in multidimensional Riemannian manifolds with non-uniformly expanding behavior. We give sufficient conditions for the continuous variation (in the L^1-norm) of the densities of absolutely continuous (with respect to the Lebesgue measure) invariant probability measures for those transformations.
