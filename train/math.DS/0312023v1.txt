We carry the argument used in the proof of the Theorem of Denjoy over to the quasiperiodically forced case. Thus we derive that if a system of quasiperiodically forced circle diffeomorphisms with bounded variation of the derivative has no invariant graphs with a certain kind of topological regularity, then the system is topologically transitive.
