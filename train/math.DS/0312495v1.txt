Title: Global stabilization of control nonlinear system "inverted pendulum on a cart" using method of two Lyapunov functions Authors: B. L. Mazov (Nizhny Novgorod Technical University) Comments: 10 pages Subj-class: Dynamical Systems MSC-class: 34D23 (Primary); 93H10 (Secondary)   In this work a mathematical apparatus for method of several global Lyapunov functions is applied to study the stability properties of nonlinear model of concrete singularly perturbed mechanical system "inverted pendulum on a cart" with discontinuous relay-type control. In this analysis, the concept of solution in sense of Gelig et al. is used.
