Consider a H\"older continuous potential \phi defined on the full shift A^\nn, where A is a finite alphabet. Let X\subset A^\nn be a specified sofic subshift. It is well-known that there is a unique Gibbs measure \mu_\phi on X associated to \phi. Besides, there is a natural nested sequence of subshifts of finite type (X_m) converging to the sofic subshift X. To this sequence we can associate a sequence of Gibbs measures (\mu_{\phi}^m). In this paper, we prove that these measures weakly converge at exponential speed to \mu_\phi (in the classical distance metrizing weak topology). We also establish a strong mixing property (ensuring weak Bernoullicity) of \mu_\phi. Finally, we prove that the measure-theoretic entropy of \mu_\phi^m converges to the one of \mu_\phi exponentially fast. We indicate how to extend our results to more general subshifts and potentials. We stress that we use basic algebraic tools (contractive properties of iterated matrices) and symbolic dynamics.
