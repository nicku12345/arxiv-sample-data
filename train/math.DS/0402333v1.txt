Given \alpha in some set \Sigma of total (Haar) measure in {\bf T}={\bf R}/{\bf Z}, and A\in C^{\infty}({\bf T},SL(2,{\bf R})) which is homotopic to the identity, we prove that if the fibered rotation number of the skew-product system (\alpha,A):{\bf T}\times SL(2,{\bf R})\to {\bf T}\times SL(2,{\bf R}), (\alpha,A)(\theta,y)=(\theta+\alpha,A(\theta)y) is diophantine with respect to \alpha and if the fibered products are uniformly bounded in the C^0-topology then the cocycle (\alpha,A) is C^\infty-reducible --that is A(\cdot)=B(\cdot+\alpha)A_0 B(\cdot)^{-1}, for some A_0\in SL(2,{\bf R}), B\in C^{\infty}({\bf T},SL(2,{\bf R})). This result which can be seen as a non-pertubative version of a theorem by L.H. Eliasson has two interesting corollaries: the first one is a result of differentiable rigidity: if \alpha\in\Sigma and the cocycle (\alpha,A) is C^0-conjugated to a constant cocycle (\alpha,A_0) with A_0 in a set of total measure in SL(2,{\bf R}) then the conjugacy is C^\infty; the second consequence is: if \alpha\in \Sigma is fixed then the set of A\in C^\infty({\bf T},SL(2,{\bf R})) for which (\alpha,A) has positive Lyapunov exponent is C^\infty-dense. A similar result is true for the Schr\"odinger cocycle and for 2-frequencies conservative differential equations in the plane.
