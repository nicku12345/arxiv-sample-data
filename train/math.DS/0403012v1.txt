We study the dynamics of iterated cosine maps E\colon z \mapsto ae^z+be^{-z}, with a,b \in \C\setminus \{0\}. We show that the points which converge to infinity under iteration are organized in the form of rays and, as in the exponential family, every escaping point is either on one of these rays or the landing point of a unique ray. Thus we get a complete classification of the escaping points of the cosine family, confirming a conjecture of Eremenko in this case. We also get a particularly strong version of the ``dimension paradox'': the set of rays has Hausdorff dimension 1, while the set of points these rays land at has not only Hausdorff dimension 2 but infinite planar Lebesgue measure.
