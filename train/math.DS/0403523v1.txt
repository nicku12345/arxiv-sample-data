We study the dynamics of skew product endomorphisms acting on the cylinder \cyl, of the form  \tht \mapsto (\ell \theta, \la \theta + \tau (\theta)),  where  \ell \geq 2 is an integer, \la \in (0,1) and \tau: \T \to \R is a continuous function. We are interested on {\it topological} properties of the global attractor \Omegalt of this map. Given \ell and a Lipschitz function \tau, we show that the attractor set \Omegalt is homeomorphic to a closed topological annulus for all \la sufficiently close to 1. Moreover, we prove that \Omegalt is a Jordan curve for at most finitely many \la \in (0,1). These results rely on a detailed study of iterated ``cohomological'' equations of the form \tau = \cL_{\la_1} \mu_1, \mu_1 = \cL_{\la_2} \mu_2, >..., where \cL_\la \mu = \mu \circ \ml - \la \mu and \ml: \T \to \T denotes the multiplication by \ell map. We show the following finiteness result: each Lipschitz function \tau can be written in a canonical way as,  \tau = \cL_{\la_1} \circ ... \circ \cL_{\la_m} \mu,  where m \ge 0, \lambda_1, ..., \lambda_m \in (0, 1] and the Lipschitz function \mu satisfies \mu \neq \cL_\la \rho for every continuous function \rho and every \la \in (0,1].
