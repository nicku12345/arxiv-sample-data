Giordano, Putnam and Skau showed that topological full groups of Cantor minimal systems are complete invariants for flip conjugacy. We will completely determine the structure of normal subgroups of the topological full group. Moreover, a necessary and sufficient condition for the topological full group to be finitely generated will be given.
