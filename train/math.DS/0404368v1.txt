We consider endomorphisms of a compact manifold which are expanding except for a finite number of points and prove the existence and uniqueness of a physical measure and its stochastical stability. We also characterize the zero-noise limit measures for a model of the intermittent map and obtain stochastic stability for some values of the parameter. The physical measures are obtained as zero-noise limits which are shown to satisfy Pesin?s Entropy Formula.
