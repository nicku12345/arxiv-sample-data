If \G is a finitely generated group with generators \{g_1,...,g_j\} then an infinite order element f \in \G is a {\em distortion element} of \G provided \displaystyle{\liminf_{n \to \infty} |f^n|/n = 0,} where |f^n| is the word length of f^n in the generators. Let S be a closed orientable surface and let \Diff(S)_0 denote the identity component of the group of C^1 diffeomorphisms of S. Our main result shows that if S has genus at least two and if f is a distortion element in some finitely generated subgroup of \Diff(S)_0, then \supp(\mu) \subset \Fix(f) for every f-invariant Borel probability measure \mu. Related results are proved for S = T^2 or S^2.   For \mu a Borel probability measure on S, denote the group of C^1 diffeomorphisms that preserve \mu by \Diff_{\mu}(S). We give several applications of our main result showing that certain groups, including a large class of higher rank lattices, admit no homomorphisms to \Diff_{\mu}(S) with infinite image.
