In this paper we study conditions under which a free minimal \mz^d-action on the Cantor set is a topological extension of the action of d rotations, either on the product \mt^d of d 1-tori or on a single 1-torus \mt^1. We extend the notion of {\it linearly recurrent} systems defined for \mz-actions on the Cantor set to \mz^d-actions and we derive in this more general setting, a necessary and sufficient condition, which involves natural combinatorial data associated with the action, allowing the existence of a rotation topological factor of one these two types.
