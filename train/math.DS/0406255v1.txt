We discuss in detail the dynamics of maps z\mapsto ae^z+be^{-z} for which both critical orbits are strictly preperiodic. The points which converge to \infty under iteration contain a set R consisting of uncountably many curves called ``rays'', each connecting \infty to a well-defined ``landing point'' in \C, so that every point in \C is either on a unique ray or the landing point of finitely many rays.   The key features of this paper are the following two: (1) this is the first example of a transcendental dynamical system where the Julia set is all of \C and the dynamics is described in detail using symbolic dynamics; and (2) we get the strongest possible version (in the plane) of the ``dimension paradox'': the set R of rays has Hausdorff dimension 1, and each point in \C\sm R is connected to \infty by one or more disjoint rays in R; as a complement of a 1-dimensional set, \C\sm R has of course Hausdorff dimension 2 and full Lebesgue measure.
