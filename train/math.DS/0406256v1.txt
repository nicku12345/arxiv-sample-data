We discuss the space of complex exponential maps \Ek\colon z\mapsto e^{z}+\kappa. We prove that every hyperbolic component W has connected boundary, and there is a conformal isomorphism \Phi_W\colon W\to\half^- which extends to a homeomorphism of pairs \Phi_W\colon(\ovl W,W)\to(\ovl\half^-,\half^-). This solves a conjecture of Baker and Rippon, and of Eremenko and Lyubich, in the affirmative. We also prove a second conjecture of Eremenko and Lyubich.
