We prove the L^{2} convergence for the linear multiple ergodic averages of commuting transformations T_{1}, ..., T_{l}, assuming that each map T_i and each pair T_iT_j^{-1} is ergodic for i\neq j. The limiting behavior of such averages is controlled by a particular factor, which is an inverse limit of nilsystems. As a corollary we show that the limiting behavior of linear multiple ergodic averages is the same for commuting transformations.
