We investigate topological mixing for Z and R actions associated with primitive substitutions on two letters. The characterization is complete if the second eigenvalue \theta_2 of the substitution matrix satisfies |\theta_2|\ne 1. If |\theta_2|<1, then (as is well-known) the substitution system is not topologically weak mixing, so it is not topologically mixing. We prove that if |\theta_2|> 1, then topological mixing is equivalent to topological weak mixing, which has an explicit arithmetic characterization. The case |\theta_2|=1 is more delicate, and we only obtain some partial results.
