A planar polygonal billiard \P is said to have the finite blocking property if for every pair (O,A) of points in \P there exists a finite number of ``blocking'' points B_1, ..., B_n such that every billiard trajectory from O to A meets one of the B_i's. Generalizing our construction of a counter-example to a theorem of Hiemer and Snurnikov (see \cite{Mo}), we show that the only regular polygons that have the finite blocking property are the square, the equilateral triangle and the hexagon. Then we extend this result to translation surfaces. We prove that the only Veech surfaces with the finite blocking property are the torus branched coverings. We also provide a local sufficient condition for a translation surface to fail the finite blocking property. This enables us to give a complete classification for the L-shaped surfaces as well as to obtain a density result in the space of translation surfaces in every genus g\geq 2.
