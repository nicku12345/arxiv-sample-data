Despite its homotopical stability, new relevant dynamics appear in the isotopy class of a pseudo-Anosov homeomorphism. We study these new dynamics by identifying homotopically equivalent orbits, obtaining a more complete description of the topology of the corresponding quotient spaces, and their stable and unstable sets. In particular, we get some insight on how new periodic points appear, among other corollaries. A list of further questions and problems is added at the end of the paper.
