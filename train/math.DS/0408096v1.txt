Let the map f:[-1,1]\to[-1,1] have a.c.i.m. \rho (absolutely continuous f-invariant measure with respect to Lebesgue). Let \delta\rho be the change of \rho corresponding to a perturbation X=\delta f\circ f^{-1} of f. Formally we have, for differentiable A,  \delta\rho(A)=\sum_{n=0}^\infty\int\rho(dx) X(x){d\over dx}A(f^nx)  but this expression does not converge in general. For f real-analytic and Markovian in the sense of covering (-1,1) m times, and assuming an {\it analytic expanding} condition, we show that \lambda\mapsto\Psi(\lambda)=\sum_{n=0}^\infty\lambda^n \int\rho(dx) X(x){d\over dx}A(f^nx)  is meromorphic in {\bf C}, and has no pole at \lambda=1. We can thus formally write \delta\rho(A)=\Psi(1).
