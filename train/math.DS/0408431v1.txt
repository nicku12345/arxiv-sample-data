A planar polygonal billiard \P is said to have the finite blocking property if for every pair (O,A) of points in \P there exists a finite number of ``blocking'' points B_1, ..., B_n such that every billiard trajectory from O to A meets one of the B_i's. As a counter-example to a theorem of Hiemer and Snurnikov, we construct a family of rational billiards that lack the finite blocking property.
