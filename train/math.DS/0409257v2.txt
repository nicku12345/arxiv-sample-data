If \alpha  is an irreducible nonexpansive ergodic automorphism of a compact abelian group X (such as an irreducible nonhyperbolic ergodic toral automorphism), then \alpha  has no finite or infinite state Markov partitions, and there are no nontrivial continuous embeddings of Markov shifts in X. In spite of this we are able to construct a symbolic space V and a class of shift-invariant probability measures on V each of which corresponds to an \alpha-invariant probability measure on X. Moreover, every \alpha-invariant probability measure on X arises essentially in this way.   The last part of the paper deals with the connection between the two-sided beta-shift V_\beta  arising from a Salem number \beta  and the nonhyperbolic ergodic toral automorphism \alpha  arising from the companion matrix of the minimal polynomial of \beta , and establishes an entropy-preserving correspondence between a class of shift-invariant probability measures on V_\beta  and certain \alpha -invariant probability measures on X. This correspondence is much weaker than, but still quite closely modelled on, the connection between the two-sided beta-shifts defined by Pisot numbers and the corresponding hyperbolic ergodic toral automorphisms.
