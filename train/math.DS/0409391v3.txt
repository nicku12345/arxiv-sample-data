We consider diffeomorphisms of a compact manifold with a dominated splitting which is hyperbolic except for a "small" subset of points (Hausdorff dimension smaller than one, e.g. a denumerable subset) and prove the existence of physical measures and their stochastical stability. The physical measures are obtained as zero-noise limits which are shown to satisfy the Entropy Formula.
