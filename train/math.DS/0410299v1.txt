We present a sufficient condition that a pseudointegrable system has weak mixing property. The result is derived from Veech's weak mixing theorem for interval exhange [Veech, W.A. Amer.J.Math. {\bf 106}, 1331 (1984)]. We also present an example whose weak mixing property can be proved by the result.
