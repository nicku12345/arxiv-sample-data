Let Aut(X,\mathcal{B}) be the group of all Borel automorphisms of a standard Borel space (X,\mathcal{B}). We study topological properties of Aut(X,\mathcal{B}) with respect to the uniform and weak topologies, \tau and p, defined in [Bezuglyi S., Dooley A.H., Kwiatkowski J., Topologies on the group of Borel automorphisms of a standard Borel space, Preprint, 2003]. It is proved that the class of smooth automorphisms is dense in (Aut(X,\mathcal B),p). Let Ctbl(X) denote the group of Borel automorphisms with countable support. It is shown that the topological group Aut_0(X,\mathcal B)=Aut(X,\mathcal{B})/Ctbl(X) is path-connected with respect to the quotient topology \tau_0. It is also proved that Aut_0(X,\mathcal B) has the Rokhlin property in the quotient topology p_0, i.e., the action of Aut_0(X,\mathcal B) on itself by conjugation is topologically transitive.
