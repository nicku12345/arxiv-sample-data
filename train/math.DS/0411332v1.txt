This paper deals with random walks on isometry groups of Gromov hyperbolic spaces, and more precisely with the dimension of the harmonic measure \nu associated with such a random walk. We first establish a link of the form \dim \nu \leq h/l between the dimension of the harmonic measure, the asymptotic entropy h of the random walk and its rate of escape l. Then we use this inequality to show that the dimension of this measure can be made arbitrarily small and deduce a result on the type of the harmonic measure.
