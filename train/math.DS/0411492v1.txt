Freire, Lopes and Mane proved that for any rational map f there exists a natural invariant measure \mu_f [5]. Mane showed there exists an n>0 such that (f^n, \mu_f) is measurably conjugate to the one-sided d^n-shift, with Bernoulli measure (\frac 1{d^n},... ,\frac 1{d^n}) \[15]. In this paper we show that (f,\mu_f)is conjugate to the one-sided Bernoulli d-shift. This verifies a conjecture of Freire, Lopes and Mane [5] and Lyubich [11].
