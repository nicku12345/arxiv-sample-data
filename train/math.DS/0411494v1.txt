A {\it uniformly p-to-one endomorphism} is a measure-preserving map with entropy log p which is almost everywhere p-to-one and for which the conditional expectation of each preimage is precisely 1/p. The {\it standard} example of this is a one-sided p-shift with uniform i.i.d. Bernoulli measure. We give a characterization of those uniformly finite-to-one endomorphisms conjugate to this standard example by a condition on the past tree of names which is analogous to {\it very weakly Bernoulli} or {\it loosely Bernoulli.} As a consequence we show that a large class of isometric extensions of the standard example are conjugate to it.
