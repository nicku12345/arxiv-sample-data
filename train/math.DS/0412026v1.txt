Let d > 1, and let (X,\alpha) and (Y,\beta) be two zero-entropy {\mathbb{Z}}^d-actions on compact abelian groups by d commuting automorphisms. We show that if all lower rank subactions of \alpha and \beta have completely positive entropy, then any measurable equivariant map from X to Y is an affine map. In particular, two such actions are measurably conjugate if and only if they are algebraically conjugate.
