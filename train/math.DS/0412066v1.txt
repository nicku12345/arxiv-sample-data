A holomorphic foliation \mathscr{F} on a compact complex manifold M is said to be an \mathscr{L}-foliation if there exists an action of a complex Lie group G such that the generic leaf of \mathscr{F} coincides with the generic orbit of G. We study \mathscr{L}-foliations of codimension one, in particular in projective space, in the spirit of classical invariant theory, but here the invariants are sometimes transcendantal ones. We give a bestiary of examples and general properties. Some classification results are obtained in low dimensions.
