For measure preserving dynamical systems on metric spaces we study the time needed by a typical orbit to return back close to its starting point. We prove that when the decay of correlation is super-polynomial the recurrence rates and the pointwise dimensions are equal. This gives a broad class of systems for which the recurrence rate equals the Hausdorff dimension of the invariant measure.
