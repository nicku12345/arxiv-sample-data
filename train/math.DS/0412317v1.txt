We show that if f: M^3\to M^3 is an A-diffeomorphism with a surface two-dimensional attractor or repeller \mathcal B and  M^2_ \mathcal B is a supporting surface for  \mathcal B, then \mathcal B = M^2_{\mathcal B} and there is k\geq 1 such that: 1) M^2_{\mathcal B} is a union M^2_1\cup...\cup M^2_k of disjoint tame surfaces such that every M^2_i is homeomorphic to the 2-torus T^2. 2) the restriction of f^k to M^2_i (i\in\{1,...,k\}) is conjugate to Anosov automorphism of T^2.
