We present an overview and some new applications of the approximation by conjugation method introduced by Anosov and the second author more than thirty years ago \cite{AK}. Michel Herman made important contributions to the development and applications of this method beginning from the construction of minimal and uniquely ergodic diffeomorphisms jointly with Fathi in \cite{FH} and continuing with exotic invariant sets of rational maps of the Riemann sphere \cite{H3}, and the construction of invariant tori with nonstandard and unexpected behavior in the context of KAM theory \cite{H1, H2}.   Recently the method has been experiencing a revival. Some of the new results presented in the paper illustrate variety of uses for tools available for a long time, others exploit new methods, in particular possibility of mixing in the context of Liouvillean dynamics discovered by the first author \cite{F1, F2}.
