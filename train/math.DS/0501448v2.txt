It is shown that if f and g are any two analytic critical circle mappings with the same irrational rotation number, then the conjugacy that maps the critical point of f to that of g has regularity C^{1+\alpha} at the critical point, with a universal value of \alpha>0. As a consequence, a new proof of the hyperbolicity of the full renormalization horseshoe of critical circle maps is given.
