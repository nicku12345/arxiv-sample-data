Lind and Schmidt have shown that the homoclinic group of a cyclic \Z^k algebraic dynamical system is isomorphic to the dual of the phase group. We show that this duality result is part of an exact sequence if k=1. The exact sequence is a well known algebraic object, which has been applied by Schmidt in his work on rigidity. We show that it can be derived from dynamical considerations only. The constructions naturally lead to an almost 1-1-coding of certain Pisot automorphisms by their associated \beta-shift, generalizing similar results for Pisot automorphisms of the torus.
