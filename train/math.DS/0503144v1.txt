We consider dynamical systems generated by skew products of affine contractions on the real line over angle-multiplying maps on the circle S^1:  T:S^{1}\times \R\to S^1\times \R, T(x,y)=(\ell x, \lambda y+f(x))  where \ell\geq 2, 0<\lambda<1 and f is a C^r function on S^1. We show that, if \lambda^{1+2s}\ell>1 for some 0\leq s< r-2, the density of the SBR measure for T is contained in the Sobolev space W^s(S^1\times \R) for almost all (C^r generic, at least) f.
