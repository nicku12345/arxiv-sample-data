We construct SRB measures for endomorphisms satisfying conditions far weaker than the non-uniformly expansion. As a consequence, the definition of non-uniformly expanding map can be weakened. We also prove the existence of an absolutely continuous invariant measure for local diffeomorphisms, only assuming the existence of hyperbolic times for Lebesgue almost all point of the manifold.
