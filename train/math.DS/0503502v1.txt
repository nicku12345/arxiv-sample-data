If L=Z^D and A is a finite set, then A^L is a compact space. A cellular automaton (CA) is a continuous transformation F:A^L--> A^L that commutes with all shift maps. A quasisturmian (QS) subshift is a shift-invariant subset obtained by mapping the trajectories of an irrational torus rotation through a partition of the torus. The image of a QS shift under a CA is again QS. We study the topological dynamical properties of CA restricted to QS shifts, and compare them to the properties of CA on the full shift A^L. We investigate injectivity, surjectivity, transitivity, expansiveness, rigidity, fixed/periodic points, and invariant measures. We also study `chopping': how iterating the CA fragments the partition generating the QS shift.
