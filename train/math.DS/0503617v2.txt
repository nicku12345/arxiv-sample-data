The well-known Conley's theorem states that the complement of chain recurrent set equals the union of all connecting orbits of the flow \phi on the compact metric space X, i.e. X-\mathcal{CR}(\phi)=\bigcup [B(A)-A], where \mathcal{CR}(\phi) denotes the chain recurrent set of \phi, A stands for an attractor and B(A) is the basin determined by A. In this paper we show that by appropriately selecting the definition of random attractor, in fact we define a random local attractor to be the \omega-limit set of some random pre-attractor surrounding it, and by considering appropriate measurability, in fact we also consider the universal \sigma-algebra \mathcal F^u-measurability besides \mathcal F-measurability, we are able to obtain the random case of Conley's theorem.
