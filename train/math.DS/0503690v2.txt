We prove measurable Livsic theorems for dynamical systems modelled by Markov Towers. Our regularity results apply to solutions of cohomological equations posed on Henon-like mappings and a wide variety of nonuniformly hyperbolic systems. We consider both Holder cocycles and cocycles with singularities of prescribed order.
