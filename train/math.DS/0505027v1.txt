We consider a planar differential system \dot{x}= P(x,y), \dot{y} = Q(x,y), where P and Q are \mathcal{C}^1 functions in some open set \mathcal{U} \subseteq \mathbb{R}^2, and \dot{}=\frac{d}{dt}. Let \gamma be a periodic orbit of the system in \mathcal{U}. Let f(x,y): \mathcal{U} \subseteq \mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{R} be a \mathcal{C}^1 function such that \[ P(x,y) \frac{\partial f}{\partial x}(x,y) + Q(x,y) \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} (x,y) = k(x,y) f(x,y), \] where k(x,y) is a \mathcal{C}^1 function in \mathcal{U} and \gamma \subseteq \{(x,y)   | f(x,y) = 0\}. We assume that if p \in \mathcal{U} is such that f(p)=0 and \nabla f(p)=0, then p is a singular point.   We prove that \int_{0}^{T} (\frac{\partial P}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial Q}{\partial y})(\gamma(t)) dt= \int_0^{T} k(\gamma(t)) dt, where T>0 is the period of \gamma. As an application, we take profit from this equality to show the hyperbolicity of the known algebraic limit cycles of quadratic systems.
