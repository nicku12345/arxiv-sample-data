We review the motivation and fundamental properties of the Hausdorff dimension of metric spaces and illustrate this with a number of examples, some of which are expected and well-known. We also give examples where the Hausdorff dimension has some surprising properties: we construct a set E\subset\C of positive planar measure and with dimension 2 such that each point in E can be joined to \infty by one or several curves in \C such that all curves are disjoint from each other and from E, and so that their union has Hausdorff dimension 1. We can even arrange things so that every point in \C which is not on one of these curves is in E. These examples have been discovered very recently; they arise quite naturally in the context of complex dynamics, more precisely in the iteration theory of simple maps such as z\mapsto \pi\sin(z).
