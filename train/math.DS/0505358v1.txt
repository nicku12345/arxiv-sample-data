We present an equation-free dynamic renormalization approach to the computational study of coarse-grained, self-similar dynamic behavior in multidimensional particle systems. The approach is aimed at problems for which evolution equations for coarse-scale observables (e.g. particle density) are not explicitly available. Our illustrative example involves Brownian particles in a 2D Couette flow; marginal and conditional Inverse Cumulative Distribution Functions (ICDFs) constitute the macroscopic observables of the evolving particle distributions.
