The Newton map N_f of an entire function f turns the roots of f into attracting fixed points. Let U be the immediate attracting basin for such a fixed point of N_f.   We study the behavior of N_f in a component V of C\U. If V can be surrounded by an invariant curve within U and satisfies the condition that each point in the extended plane has at most finitely many preimages in V, we show that V contains another immediate basin of N_f or a virtual immediate basin. A virtual immediate basin is an unbounded invariant Fatou component in which the dynamics converges to infty through an absorbing set.
