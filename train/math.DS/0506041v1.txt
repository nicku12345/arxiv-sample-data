In this paper, we study pseudo-rotations of the open annulus, \emph{i.e.} conservative homeomorphisms of the open annulus whose rotation set is reduced to a single irrational number (the angle of the pseudo-rotation). We prove in particular that, for every pseudo-rotation h of angle \rho, the rigid rotation of angle \rho is in the closure of the conjugacy class of h. We also prove that pseudo-rotations are not persistent in C^r topology for any r\geq 0.
