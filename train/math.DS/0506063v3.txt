Using probabilistic methods, we prove new rigidity results for groups and pseudo-groups of diffeomorphisms of one dimensional manifolds with intermediate regularity class ({\em i.e.} between C^1 and C^2). In particular, we demonstrate some generalizations of Denjoy's Theorem and the classical Kopell's Lemma for Abelian groups. After that, these techniques are applied to the study of codimension 1 foliations. We obtain for instance several generalized versions of Sacksteder's Theorem in class C^1. We conclude with some remarks about the stationary measure.
