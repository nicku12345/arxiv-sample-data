Group valued edge labellings \lambda of a Bratteli diagram B give rise to a skew-product Bratteli diagram B(\lambda) on which the group acts. The quotient by the group action of the associated dynamics can be a nontrivial extension of the dynamics of B. We exhibit a Bratteli diagram for this quotient and construct a morphism to B with unique path lifting property. This is shown to be an isomorphism for the dynamics if a property `loops lifting to loops' is satisfied by B(\lambda)\to B.
