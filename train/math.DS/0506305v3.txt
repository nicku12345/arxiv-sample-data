In another article we associated a dynamical system to a non-properly ordered Bratteli diagram. In this article we describe how to compute the K-group K_0 of the dynamical system in terms of the Bratteli diagram. In the case of properly ordered Bratteli diagrams this description coincides with what is already known, namely the so-called dimension group of the Bratteli diagram. The new ordered group defined here is more relevant for non-properly ordered Bratteli diagrams. We use our main result to describe K_0 of a substitutional system.
