The presence of noise in non linear dynamical systems can play a constructive role, increasing the degree of order and coherence or evoking improvements in the performance of the system. An example of this positive influence in a biological system is the impulse transmission in neurons and the synchronization of a neural network. Integrating numerically the Fokker-Planck equation we show a self-induced synchronized oscillation. Such an oscillatory state appears in a neural network coupled with a feedback term, when this system is excited by noise and the noise strength is within a certain range.
