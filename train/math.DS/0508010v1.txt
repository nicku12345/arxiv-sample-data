We note an elementary proof of the existence and uniqueness of a solution % \mu \in \mathbb{P(X)} to the equation \mu =p\mu_{0}+q\hat{F}\mu . Here \mathbb{X} is a topological space, \mathbb{P(X)} is the set of Borel measures of unit mass on \mathbb{X}, \mu_{0}\in  \mathbb{P(X)} is given, p>0, and q\geq 0 with p+q=1. The transformation \hat{F}:% \mathbb{P(X)\to P(X)} is defined by \hat{F}\upsilon =\tsum\limits_{n=1}^{N}p_{n}\upsilon \circ f_{n}^{-1} where f_{n}:\mathbb{% X\to X} is continuous, p_{n}>0 for n=1,2,...,N, N is a finite strictly positive integer, and \tsum\limits_{n=1}^{N}p_{n}=1. This problem occurs in connection with iterated function systems (IFS).
