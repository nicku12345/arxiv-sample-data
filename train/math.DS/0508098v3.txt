We prove the existence of a continuous family of positive and generally non-monotone travelling fronts in delayed reaction-diffusion equations u_t(t,x) = \Delta u(t,x)- u(t,x) + g(u(t-h,x)) (*), when g \in C^2(R_+,R_+) has exactly two fixed points: x_1= 0 and x_2= a >0. Recently, non-monotonic waves were observed in numerical simulations by various authors. Here, for a wide range of parameters, we explain why such waves appear naturally as the delay h grows. For the case of g with negative Schwarzian, our conditions are rather optimal; we observe that the well known Mackey-Glass type equations with diffusion fall within this subclass of (*). As an example, we consider the diffusive Nicholson's blowflies equation.
