Following the analysis of differentiable mappings of Y. Yomdin, M. Gromov has stated a very elegant "Algebraic Lemma" which says that the "differentiable size" of an algebraic subset may be bounded in terms only of its dimension, degree and diameter. We give a complete and elementary proof of Gromov's result using the ideas presented in his Bourbaki talk as well as other necessary ingredients.
