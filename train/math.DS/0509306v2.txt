An attractor \Lambda for a 3-vector field X is singular-hyperbolic if all its singularities are hyperbolic and it is partially hyperbolic with volume expanding central direction. We prove that C^{1+\alpha} singular-hyperbolic attractors, for some \alpha>0, always have zero volume, thus extending an analogous result for uniformly hyperbolic attractors. The same result holds for a class of higher dimensional singular attractors. Moreover, we prove that if \Lambda is a singular-hyperbolic attractor for X then either it has zero volume or X is an Anosov flow. We also present examples of C^1 singular-hyperbolic attractors with positive volume. In addition, we show that C^1 generically we have volume zero for C^1 robust classes of singular-hyperbolic attractors.
