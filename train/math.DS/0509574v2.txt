We prove that if F is a finitely generated abelian group of orientation preserving C^1 diffeomorphisms of R^2 which leaves invariant a compact set then there is a common fixed point for all elements of F. We also show that if F is any abelian subgroup of orientation preserving C^1 diffeomorphisms of S^2 then there is a common fixed point for all elements of a subgroup of F with index at most two.
