Let \Lambda be a compact locally maximal invariant set of a C^2-diffeomorphism f:M\to M on a smooth Riemannian manifold M. In this paper we study the topological pressure P_{\rm top}(\phi) (with respect to the dynamical system f|\Lambda) for a wide class of H\"older continuous potentials and analyze its relation to dynamical, as well as geometrical, properties of the system. We show that under a mild nonuniform hyperbolicity assumption the topological pressure of \phi is entirely determined by the values of \phi on the saddle points of f in \Lambda. Moreover, it is enough to consider saddle points with ``large'' Lyapunov exponents. We also introduce a version of the pressure for certain non-continuous potentials and establish several variational inequalities for it. Finally, we deduce relations between expansion and escape rates and the dimension of \Lambda. Our results generalize several well-known results to certain non-uniformly hyperbolic systems.
