Let (\az,F) be a bipermutative algebraic cellular automaton. We present conditions which force a probability measure which is invariant for the \N\times\Z-action of F and the shift map \s to be the Haar measure on \gs, a closed shift-invariant subgroup of the Abelian compact group \az. This generalizes simultaneously results of B. Host, A. Maass and S. Mart\'{\i}nez \cite{Host-Maass-Martinez-2003} and M. Pivato \cite{Pivato-2003}. This result is applied to give conditions which also force a (F,\s)-invariant probability measure to be the uniform Bernoulli measure when F is a particular invertible expansive cellular automaton on \an.
