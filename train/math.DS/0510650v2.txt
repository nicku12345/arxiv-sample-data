We show that special perturbations of a particular holomorphic map on \mathbf{P}^k give us examples of maps that possess chaotic nonalgebraic attractors. Furthermore, we study the dynamics of the maps on the attractors. In particular, we construct invariant hyperbolic measures supported on the attractors with nice dynamical properties.
