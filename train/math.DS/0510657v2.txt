In this article, the Galois groupoid of the first Painlev\'{e} equation is computed. This computation use E. Cartan's classification of structural equations of pseudogroups acting on C^2 and the degeneration of the first Painlev\'{e} equation on an elliptic equation (y'' = 6y^2). A definition of reducibility for singular holomorphic foliations is proposed. A characterisation of reducible foliations on their Galois groupoid is given and applied to prove the foliation irreducibility of the first Painlev\'{e} equation.
