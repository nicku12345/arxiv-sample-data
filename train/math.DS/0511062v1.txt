We study the pointwise convergence of some weighted averages linked to averages along cubes. We show that if (X,\mathcal{B},\mu, T_i) are not necessarily commuting measure preserving systems on the same finite measure space and if f_i, 1\leq i\leq 6 are bounded functions then the averages   \frac{1}{N^3}\sum_{n, m, p=1}^N f_1(T_1^nx) f_2(T_2^mx) f_3(T_3^px) f_4(T_4^{n+m}x) f_5(T_5^{n+p}x) f_6(T_6^{m+p}x)   converge almost everywhere.
