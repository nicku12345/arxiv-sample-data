Consider the cellular automata (CA) of \mathbb{Z}^{2}-action \Phi on the space of all doubly infinite sequences with values in a finite set \mathbb{Z}_{r}, r \geq 2 determined by cellular automata T_{F[-k, k]} with an additive automaton rule F(x_{n-k},...,x_{n+k})=\sum\limits_{i=-k}^{k}a_{i}x_{n+i}(mod r). It is investigated the concept of the measure theoretic directional entropy per unit of length in the direction \omega_{0}. It is shown that h_{\mu}(T_{F[-k,k]}^{u})=uh_{\mu}(T_{F[-k,k]}), h_{\mu}(\Phi^{u})=uh_{\mu}(\Phi) and h_{\vec{v}}(\Phi^{u})=uh_{\vec{v}}(\Phi) for \vec{v} \in \mathbb{Z}^{2} where h is the measure-theoretic entropy.
