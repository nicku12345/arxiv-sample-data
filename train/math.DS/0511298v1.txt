We provide a complete system of invariants for the formal classification of complex analytic unipotent germs of diffeomorphism at \cn{n} fixing the orbits of a regular vector field. We reduce the formal classification problem to solve a linear differential equation. Then we describe the formal invariants; their nature depends on the position of the fixed points set Fix \phi with respect to the regular vector field preserved by \phi. We get invariants specifically attached to higher dimension (n \geq 3) although generically they are analogous to the one-dimensional ones.
