In 1993, E. Lesigne proved a polynomial extension of the Wiener-Wintner ergodic theorem and asked two questions: does this result have a uniform counterpart and can an assumption of total ergodicity be replaced by ergodicity? The purpose of this article is to answer these questions, the first one positively and the second one negatively.
