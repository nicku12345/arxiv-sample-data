The main result given in Theorem~1.1 is a condition for a map X, defined on the complement of a disk D in R^2 with values in R^2, to be extended to a topological embedding of R^2, not necessarily surjective. The map X is supposed to be just differentiable with the condition that, for some e>0, at each point the eigenvalues of the differential do not belong to the real interval (-e,\infty). The extension is obtained by restricting X to the complement of some larger disc. The result has important connections with the property of asymptotic stability at infinity for differentiable vector fields.
