We investigate the connection between the abelian rank of a countable amenable group and the existence of good averaging sequences (e.g. for the pointwise ergodic theorem). We show that if G is a group of abelian rank r(G) then any Tempel'man sequence must have constant at least 2^{r(G)} and if G is abelian this constant is achieved. On the other hand, infinite rank excludes the existence of Tempel'man sequences and forces all tempered sequences to grow super-exponentially.
