Results of Wyner and Ziv and of Ornstein and Weiss show that if one observes the first k outputs of a finite-valued ergodic process, then the waiting time until this block appears again is almost surely asymptotic to 2^{hk}, where h is the entropy of the process. We examine this phenomenon when the allowed return times are restricted to some subset of times, and generalize the results to processes parameterized by other discrete amenable groups.   We also obtain a uniform density version of the waiting time results: For a process on s symbols, within a given realization, the density of the initial k-block within larger n-blocks approaches 2^{-hk}, uniformly in n>s^k, as k tends to infinity. Again, similar results hold for processes with other indexing groups.
