We consider actions of the free semigroup with two generators on the real line, where the generators act as affine maps, one contracting and one expanding, with distinct fixed points. Then every orbit is dense in a half-line, which leads to the question whether it is, in some sense, uniformly distributed. We present answers to this question for various interpretations of the phrase ``uniformly distributed''.
