We obtain estimates for derivative and cross--ratio distortion for C^{2+\eta} (any \eta>0) unimodal maps with non--flat critical points. We do not require any `Schwarzian--like' condition.   For two intervals J \subset T, the cross--ratio is defined as the value B(T,J):=\frac{|T||J|}{|L||R|} where L,R are the left and right connected components of T\setminus J respectively. For an interval map g \st g_T:T \to \RRR is a diffeomorphism, we consider the cross--ratio distortion to be B(g,T, J):=\frac{B(g(T),g(J))}{B(T,J)}.   We prove that for all 0<K<1 there exists some interval I_0 around the critical point \st for any intervals J \subset T, if f^n|_T is a diffeomorphism and f^n(T) \subset I_0 then B(f^n, T, J)> K. Then the distortion of derivatives of f^n|_J can be estimated with the Koebe Lemma in terms of K and B(f^n(T),f^n(J)). This tool is commonly used to study topological, geometric and ergodic properties of f. This extends a result of Kozlovski.
