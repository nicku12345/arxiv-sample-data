The objective of this paper is to investigate the stability of limit cycles of a mathematical model with a distributed delay which describes the interaction between p53 and mdm2. Choosing the delay as a bifurcation parameter we study the direction and stability of the bifurcating periodic solutions using the normal form and the center manifold theorem. Some numerical examples are finally made in order to confirm the theoretical results.
