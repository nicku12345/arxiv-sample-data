In this paper, we extend a result of Kesten and Spitzer (1979). Let us consider a stationary sequence (\xi\_k:=f(T^k(.)))\_k given by an invertible probability dynamical system and some centered function f. Let (S\_n)\_n be a simple symmetric random walk on Z independent of (\xi\_k)\_k. We give examples of partially hyperbolic dynamical systems and of functions f such that n^{-3/4}(\xi(S\_1)+...+\xi(S\_k)) converges in distribution as n goes to infinity.
