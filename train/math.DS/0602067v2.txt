We investigate the statistical properties of a piecewise smooth dynamical system by studying directly the action of the transfer operator on appropriate spaces of distributions. We accomplish such a program in the case of two-dimensional maps with uniformly bounded second derivative, but we are confident that the present approach can be successful in much greater generality (we hope including higher dimensional billiards). For the class of systems at hand, we obtain a complete description of the SRB measures, their statistical properties and their stability with respect to many types of perturbations, including deterministic and random perturbations and holes.
