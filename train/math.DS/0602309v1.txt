We consider existence and stability of an almost periodic solution of the quasilinear system of differential equations with piecewise constant argument of generalized type. The associated linear homogeneous system satisfies exponential dichotomy. The deviations of the argument are not restricted by any sign assumption when existence is considered. The problem of positive (almost periodic) solutions of the logistic equation is discussed as an example.   A new technique of investigation of equations with piecewise argument, based on integral representation, is developed.
