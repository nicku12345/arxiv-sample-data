The uniform norm of the differential of the n-th iteration of a diffeomorphism is called the growth sequence of the diffeomorphism. In this paper we show that there is no lower universal growth bound for volume preserving diffeomorphisms on manifolds with an effective two dimensions torus action by constructing a set of volume-preserving diffeomorphisms with arbitrarily slow growth.
