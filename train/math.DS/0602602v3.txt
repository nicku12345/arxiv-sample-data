We give a combinatorial classification of postsingularly finite exponential maps in terms of external addresses starting with the entry 0. This is an extension of the classification results for critically preperiodic polynomials \cite{BFH} to exponential maps. Our proof relies on the topological characterization of postsingularly finite exponential maps given recently in \cite{HSS}. Our results illustrate once again the fruitful interplay between combinatorics, topology and complex structure which has often been successful in complex dynamics.
