We prove that, for translation surfaces whose homology is generated by the periodic orbits, the notions of - finite blocking property - pure periodicity - torus branched covering are equivalent. In particular, we prove this equivalence for convex surfaces and on a dense open subset of full measure on every normalized stratum.
