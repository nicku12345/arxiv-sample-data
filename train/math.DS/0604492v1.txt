In this paper we recall the concepts of G-odometer and G-subodometer for G-actions, where G is a discrete finitely generated group, which generalize the notion of odometer in the case G=\ZZ. We characterize the G-regularly recurrent systems as the minimal almost 1-1 extensions of subodometers, from which we deduce that the family of the G-Toeplitz subshifts coincides with the family of the minimal symbolic almost 1-1 extensions of subodometers.
