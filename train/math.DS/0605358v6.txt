We consider the system of N (\ge2) elastically colliding hard balls of masses m_1,...,m_N and radius r on the flat unit torus \Bbb T^\nu, \nu\ge2. We prove the so called Boltzmann-Sinai Ergodic Hypothesis, i. e. the full hyperbolicity and ergodicity of such systems for every selection (m_1,...,m_N;r) of the external geometric parameters, provided that almost every singular orbit is geometrically hyperbolic (sufficient), i. e. the so called Chernov-Sinai Ansatz is true. The present proof does not use the formerly developed, rather involved algebraic techniques, instead it employs exclusively dynamical methods and tools from geometric analysis.
