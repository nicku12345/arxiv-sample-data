We construct new families of examples of (real) Anosov Lie algebras starting with algebraic units. We also give examples of indecomposable Anosov Lie algebras (not a direct sum of proper Lie ideals) of dimension 13 and 16, and we conclude that for every n \geq 6 with n \neq 7 there exists an indecomposable Anosov Lie algebra of dimension n.
