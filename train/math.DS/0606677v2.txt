We consider complex polynomials f(z) = z^\ell+c_1 for \ell \in 2\N and c_1 \in \R, and find some combinatorial types and values of \ell such that there is no invariant probability measure equivalent to conformal measure on the Julia set. This holds for particular Fibonacci-like and Feigenbaum combinatorial types when \ell sufficiently large and also for a class of `long-branched' maps of any critical order.
