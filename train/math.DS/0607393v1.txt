Let Y=(f,g,h):\mathbb{R}^{3} \to \mathbb{R}^{3} be a C^{2} map and let \spec(Y) denote the set of eigenvalues of the derivative DY_p, when p varies in \mathbb{R}^3. We begin proving that if, for some \epsilon>0, \spec(Y)\cap (-\epsilon,\epsilon)=\emptyset, then the foliation \mathcal{F}(k), with k\in \{f,g,h\}, made up by the level surfaces \{k={\rm constant}\}, consists just of planes. As a consequence, we prove a bijectivity result related to the three-dimensional case of Jelonek's Jacobian Conjecture for polynomial maps of \mathbb{R}^n.
