A numeration system originally implies a digitization of real numbers, but in this paper it rather implies a compactification of real numbers as a result of the digitization. By definition, a numeration system with G, where G is a nontrivial closed multiplicative subgroup of {\mathbb{R}}_+, is a nontrivial compact metrizable space \Omega admitting a continuous (\lambda\omega+t)-action of (\lambda,t)\in G\times{\mathbb{R}} to \omega\in\Omega, such that the (\omega+t)-action is strictly ergodic with the unique invariant probability measure \mu_{\Omega}, which is the unique G-invariant probability measure attaining the topological entropy |\log\lambda| of the transformation \omega\mapsto\lambda\omega for any \lambda\ne 1. We construct a class of numeration systems coming from weighted substitutions, which contains those coming from substitutions or \beta-expansions with algebraic \beta. It also contains those with G={\mathbb{R}}_+. We obtained an exact formula for the \zeta-function of the numeration systems coming from weighted substitutions and studied the properties. We found a lot of applications of the numeration systems to the \beta-expansions, Fractal geometry or the deterministic self-similar processes which are seen in \cite{K4}. This paper is based on \cite{K3} changing the way of presentation. The complete version of this paper is in \cite{K4}.
