Motivated by the Lagrange top coupled to an oscillator, we consider the quasi-periodic Hamiltonian Hopf bifurcation. To this end, we develop the normal linear stability theory of an invariant torus with a generic (i.e., non-semisimple) normal 1:-1 resonance. This theory guarantees the persistence of the invariant torus in the Diophantine case and makes possible a further quasi-periodic normal form, necessary for investigation of the non-linear dynamics. As a consequence, we find Cantor families of invariant isotropic tori of all dimensions suggested by the integrable approximation.
