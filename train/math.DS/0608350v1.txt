The concept of a configuration graph associated to a primitive, aperiodic substitution is introduced in [1] as a convenient graphical representation of the infinite indeterminism of the shift space of the substitution. The main result of [1] is an algorithm to calculate this graph from the substitution, in this paper we turn the tables and produce substitutions from graphs. We do this using the Zorro algorithm, an entirely constructive and easily applicable algorithm. In the process we show that any configuration graph can be obtained.   The first section contains standard definitions and the definition of configuration graphs. The second and third sections develop theory used in the proof of the algorithm as stated in section four. The algorithm is easily applied without knowledge of the underlying theory. Note that section three is nothing but a copy of results from [1] slightly modified to suit the present needs.
