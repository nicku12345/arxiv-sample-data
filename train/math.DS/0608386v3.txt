In this paper, we show that the H\'enon map \varphi_{a,b} has a generically unfolding cubic tangency for some (a,b) arbitrarily close to (-2,0) by applying results of Gonchenko-Shilnikov-Turaev [12]-[16]. Combining this fact with theorems in Kiriki-Soma [20], one can observe the new phenomena in the H\'enon family, appearance of persistent antimonotonic tangencies and cubic polynomial-like strange attractors.
