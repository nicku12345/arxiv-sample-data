Let M be a smooth finite-dimensional manifold, G be a Lie group, and \Phi:G \times M \to M be a smooth action. Consider the following mapping \phi: C^{\infty}(M,G) \to C^{\infty}(M,M), defined by \phi(\alpha)(x) = \alpha(x)\cdot x, for \alpha\in C^{\infty}(M,G) and x\in M. In this paper we describe the structure of inverse images of elements of C^{\infty}(M,M) under \phi for \dim G=1, i.e. when G is either \mathbb{R} or S^1. As an application we obtain a new proof of the well-known theorem by M. Newman concerning the interior of the fixed point set of a Lie group action.
