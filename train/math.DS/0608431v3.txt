We propose a new model of ergodic optimization for expansive dynamical systems: the holonomic setting. In fact, we introduce an extension of the standard model used in this theory. The formulation we consider here is quite natural if one wants a meaning for possible variations of a real trajectory under the forward shift. In another contexts (for twist maps, for instance), this property appears in a crucial way.   A version of the Aubry-Mather theory for symbolic dynamics is introduced. We are mainly interested here in problems related to the properties of maximizing probabilities for the two-sided shift. Under the transitive hypothesis, we show the existence of sub-actions for Holder potentials also in the holonomic setting. We analyze then connections between calibrated sub-actions and the Mane potential. A representation formula for calibrated sub-actions is presented, which drives us naturally to a classification theorem for these sub-actions. We also investigate properties of the support of maximizing probabilities.
