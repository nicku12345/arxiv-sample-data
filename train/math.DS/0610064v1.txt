On the one hand, we prove that the spaces of C^1 symplectomorphisms and of C^1 volume-preserving diffeomorphisms both contain residual subsets of diffeomorphisms whose centralizers are trivial. On the other hand, we show that the space of C^1 diffeomorphisms of the circle and a non-empty open set of C^1 diffeomorphisms of the two-sphere contain dense subsets of diffeomorphisms whose centralizer has a sub-group isomorphic to R.
