We consider the family f_{a,b}(x,y)=(y,(y+a)/(x+b)) of birational maps of the plane and the parameter values (a,b) for which f_{a,b} gives an automorphism of a rational surface. In particular, we find values for which f_{a,b} is an automorphism of positive entropy but no invariant curve. The Main Theorem: If f_{a,b} is an automorphism with an invariant curve and positive entropy, then either (1) (a,b) is real, and the restriction of f to the real points has maximal entropy, or (2) f_{a,b} has a rotation (Siegel) domain.
