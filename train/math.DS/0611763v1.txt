In this paper we investigate the growth rate of the number of all possible paths in graphs with respect to their length in an exact analytical way. Apart from the typical rates of growth, i.e. exponential or polynomial, we identify conditions for a stretched exponential type of growth. This is made possible by combining two or more graphs over the same alphabet, in order to obtain a discrete dynamical system generated by a triangular map, which can also be interpreted as a discrete non-autonomous system. Since the vertices and the edges of a graph usually are used to depict the states and transitions between states of a discrete dynamical system, the combination of two (or more) graphs can be interpreted as the driving, or perturbation, of one system by another.
