In this paper, we study asynchronous consensus problems of continuous-time multi-agent systems with discontinuous information transmission. The proposed consensus control strategy is implemented only based on the state information at some discrete times of each agent's neighbors. The asynchronization means that each agent's update times, at which the agent adjusts its dynamics, are independent of others'. Furthermore, it is assumed that the communication topology among agents is time-dependent and the information transmission is with bounded time-varying delays. If the union of the communication topology across any time interval with some given length contains a spanning tree, the consensus problem is shown to be solvable. The analysis tool developed in this paper is based on the nonnegative matrix theory and graph theory. The main contribution of this paper is to provide a valid distributed consensus algorithm that overcomes the difficulties caused by unreliable communication channels, such as intermittent information transmission, switching communication topology, and time-varying communication delays, and therefore has its obvious practical applications. Simulation examples are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of our theoretical results.
