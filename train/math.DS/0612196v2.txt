In this paper we revisit the existence of traveling waves for delayed reaction diffusion equations by the monotone iteration method. We show that Perron Theorem on existence of bounded solution provides a rigorous and constructive framework to find traveling wave solutions of reaction diffusion systems with time delay. The method is tried out on two classical examples with delay: the predator-prey and Belousov-Zhabotinskii models.
