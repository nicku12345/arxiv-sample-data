A property (D) of subshifts was defined in: Wolfgang Krieger, On g-functions for subshifts, IMS Lecture Notes- Monograph Series, Vol. 48, Dynamics & Stochastics (2006) 306 - 316, arXiv:math.DS/0608259. With a view towards a theory of g-fnctions beyond the case of finte type subshifts partially defined continuous g-functions of property (D) subshifts are studied.
