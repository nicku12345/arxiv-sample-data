Consider a transitive expanding dynamical system  \sigma: \Sigma \to \Sigma , and a H\"older potential  A . In ergodic optimization, one is interested in properties of A-maximizing probabilities. Assuming ergodicity, it is already known that the projection of the support of such probabilities is contained in the set of non-wandering points with respect to  A , denoted by  \Omega(A) . A separating sub-action is a sub-action such that the sub-cohomological equation becomes an identity just on  \Omega(A) . For a fixed H\"older potential  A , we prove not only that there exists H\"older separating sub-actions but in fact that they define a residual subset of the H\"older sub-actions.   We use the existence of such separating sub-actions in an application for the case one has more than one maximizing probability. Suppose we have a finite number of distinct A-maximizing probabilities with ergodic property:  \hat \mu_j ,  j \in \{1, 2, ..., l\} . Considering a calibrated sub-action  u , under certain conditions, we will show that it can be written in the form  u (\mathbf x)= u (\mathbf x^i) + h_A(\mathbf x^i, \mathbf x),  for all  \mathbf x \in \Sigma , where  \mathbf x^i  is a special point (in the projection of the support of a certain  \hat \mu_i ) and  h_A  is the Peierls barrier associated to  A .
