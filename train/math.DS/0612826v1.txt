This paper introduces a new difference scheme to the difference equations for N-body type problems. To find the non-collision periodic solutions and generalized periodic solutions in multi-radial symmetric constraint for the N-body type difference equations, the variational approach and the method of minimizing the Lagrangian action are adopted and the strong force condition is considered correspondingly, which is an efficient method in studying those with singular potentials. And the difference equation can also be taken into consideration of other periodic solutions with symmetric or choreographic constraint in further studies.
