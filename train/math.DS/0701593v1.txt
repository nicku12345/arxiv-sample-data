We study the effects of periodically time varying mass on the stability of the Helmholtz oscillator, which, when linearised, takes the form of Ince's equation and exhibits parametric resonance. The resonance regions in the parameter space are mapped and we use the Melnikov function to demonstrate that the parametric instability does not affect the qualitative dynamics of the nonlinear system.
