In this paper we introduce the idea of probability in the definition of Sequential Dynamical Systems, thus obtaining a new concept, Probabilistic Sequential System. The introduction of a probabilistic structure on Sequential Dynamical Systems is an important and interesting problem.   The notion of homomorphism of our new model, is a natural extension of homomorphism of sequential dynamical systems introduced and developed by Laubenbacher and Paregeis in several papers. Our model, give the possibility to describe the dynamic of the systems using Markov chains and all the advantage of stochastic theory. The notion of simulation is introduced using the concept of homomorphisms, as usual. Several examples of homomorphisms, subsystems and simulations are given.
