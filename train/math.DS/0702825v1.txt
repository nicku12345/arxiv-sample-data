Two types of population models are well known -- the continuous and the discrete types.The two have very different characteristics and methods of solutions and analysis.In this note, we point out that an iterative technique when applied to the continuous case mimics, surprisingly the discrete theory. The implication is that techniques and conclusions of the latter theory can now be applied to the former case (and vice versa).
