We reinvestigate the theory of deformations of tilings using P-equivariant cohomology. In particular we relate the notion of asymptotically negligible shape functions introduced by Clark and Sadun to weakly P-equivariant forms. We then investigate more closely the relation between deformations of patterns and homeomorphism or topological conjugacy of pattern spaces.
