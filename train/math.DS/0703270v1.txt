We consider intermittent maps T of the interval, with an absolutely continuous invariant probability measure \mu. Kim showed that there exists a sequence of intervals A_n such that \sum \mu(A_n)=\infty, but \{A_n\} does not satisfy the dynamical Borel-Cantelli lemma, i.e., for almost every x, the set \{n : T^n(x)\in A_n\} is finite. If \sum \Leb(A_n)=\infty, we prove that \{A_n\} satisfies the Borel-Cantelli lemma. Our results apply in particular to some maps T whose correlations are not summable.
