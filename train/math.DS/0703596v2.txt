The main change with respect to the previous version is a change of terminology : we call "ordinary" the webs previously called "regular". A holomorphic d-web of codimension one in dimension n is "ordinary", if it satisfies to some condition of genericity. In dimension at least 3, any such web has a rank bounded from above by a number \pi'(n,d) strictly smaller than the bound \pi(n,d) of castelnuovo. This bound \pi'(n,d) is optimal. Moreover, for some d's, the abelian relations are sections with vanishing covariant derivative of some bundle with a connection, the curvature of which generalizes the Blaschke curvature. In dimension 2, we recover results of H\'enaut and Pantazi
