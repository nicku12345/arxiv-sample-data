Motivated by mirror symmetry, we consider the Lagrangian fibration \R^4\to\R^2 and Lagrangian maps f:L\hookrightarrow \R^4\to \R^2, exhibiting an unstable singularity, and study how the bifurcation locus of gradient lines, the integral curves of \nabla f_x, for x\in B, where f_x(y)=f(y)-x\cdot y, changes when f is slightly perturbed. We consider the cases when f is the germ of a fold, of a cusp and, particularly, of an elliptic umbilic.
