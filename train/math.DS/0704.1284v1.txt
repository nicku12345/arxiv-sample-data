Food scientists at the U.S. Army's Natick Solider Center have developed a model for the lifecyle of the bacteria Staphylococcus aureus in intermediate moisture bread. In this article, we study this model using dynamical systems and Lie symmetry methods. We calculate center manifolds and Lie symmetries for different cases of parameter values and compare our results to those of the food scientists.
