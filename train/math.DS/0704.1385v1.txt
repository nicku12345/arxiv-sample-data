We study the rate of growth of ratios of intervals delimited by the post-critical orbit of a map in the quasi-quadratic family x\mapsto -|x|^\alpha +a. The critical order \alpha is an arbitrary real number \alpha>1. The range of the parameter a is confined to an interval (1,a_{\alpha}) of length depending on the critical order. We prove that in every power-law family there is a unique parameter p_{\alpha} corresponding to the kneading sequence RLRRRLRC. Subsequently, we obtain monotonicity results concerning ratios of all intervals labeled by infinite post-critical orbit in the case of the kneading sequence RLRL... This extends the results from \cite{P}, via refinement of the tools based on special properties of power-law mappings in non-euclidean metric.
