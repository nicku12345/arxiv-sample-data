We give an alternative proof of the Benedicks-Carleson theorem on the existence of strange attractors in H\'enon-like families in the plane. To bypass a huge inductive argument, we introduce an induction-free explicit definition of dynamically critical points. The argument is sufficiently general and in particular applies to the case of non-invertible maps as well. It naturally raises the question of an intrinsic characterization of dynamically critical points for dissipative surface maps.
