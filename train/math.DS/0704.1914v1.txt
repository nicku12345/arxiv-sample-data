We study the representations of the commutator subgroup K_{n} of the braid group B_{n} into a finite group . This is done through a symbolic dynamical system. Some experimental results enable us to compute the number of subgroups of K_{n} of a given (finite) index, and, as a by-product, to recover the well known fact that every representation of K_{n} into S_{r}, with n > r, must be trivial.
