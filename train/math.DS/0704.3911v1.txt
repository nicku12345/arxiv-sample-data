Let K be a compact metrizable group and \Ga be a group of automorphisms of K. We first show that each \ap \in \Ga is distal on K implies \Ga itself is distal on K, a local to global correspondence provided \Ga is a generalized \ov{FC}-group or K is a connected finite-dimensional group. We show that \Ga contains an ergodic automorphism when \Ga is nilpotent and ergodic on a connected finite-dimensional compact abelian group K.
