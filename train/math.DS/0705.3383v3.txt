The average R(t) of a smooth function with respect to the SRB measure of a smooth one-parameter family f_t of piecewise expanding interval maps is not always Lipschitz. We prove that if f_t is tangent to the topological class of f_0, then R(t) is differentiable at zero, and the derivative coincides with the resummation previously proposed by the first named author of the (a priori divergent) series given by Ruelle's conjecture.
