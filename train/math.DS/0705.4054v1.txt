In these lectures we consider how algebraic properties of discrete subgroups of Lie groups restrict the possible actions of those groups on surfaces. The results show a strong parallel between the possible actions of such a group on the circle S^1 and the measure preserving actions on surfaces.   Our aim is the study of the (non)-existence of actions of lattices in a large class of non-compact Lie groups on surfaces. A definitive analysis of the analogous question for actions on S^1 was carried out by \'E. Ghys. Our approach is topological and insofar as possible we try to isolate properties of a group which provide the tools necessary for our analysis. The two key properties we consider are almost simplicity and the existence of a distortion element. Both will be defined and described in the lectures.   Our techniques are almost all from low dimensional dynamics. But we are interested in how algebraic properties of a group -- commutativity, nilpotence, etc. affect the possible kinds of dynamics which can occur. For most of the results we will consider groups of diffeomorphisms which preserve a Borel probability measure.
