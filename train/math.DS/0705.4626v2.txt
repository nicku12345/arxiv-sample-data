We introduce new families of enhanced chaotic number generators in order to compute very fast long series of pseudorandom numbers. The key feature of these generators being the use of chaotic numbers themselves for sampling chaotic subsequence of chaotic numbers in order to hide the generating function. We explore numerically the properties of these new families and underline their very high qualities and usefulness as CPRNG when series are computed up to 10 trillions iterations.
