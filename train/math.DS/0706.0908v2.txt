Associated to a IFS one can consider a continuous map \hat{\sigma} : [0,1]\times \Sigma \to [0,1]\times \Sigma, defined by \hat{\sigma}(x,w)=(\tau_{X_{1}(w)}(x), \sigma(w)) were \Sigma=\{0,1, ..., d-1\}^{\mathbb{N}}, \sigma: \Sigma \to \Sigma is given by\sigma(w_{1},w_{2},w_{3},...)=(w_{2},w_{3},w_{4}...) and X_{k} : \Sigma \to \{0,1, ..., n-1\} is the projection on the coordinate k. A \rho-weighted system, \rho \geq 0, is a weighted system ([0,1], \tau_{i}, u_{i}) such that there exists a positive bounded function h : [0,1] \to \mathbb{R} and probability \nu  on [0,1] satisfying  P_{u}(h)=\rho h, \quad P_{u}^{*}(\nu)=\rho\nu. A probability \hat{\nu} on [0,1]\times \Sigma is called holonomic for \hat{\sigma} if  \int g \circ \hat{\sigma} d\hat{\nu}= \int g d\hat{\nu}, \forall g \in C([0,1]). We denote the set of holonomic probabilities by {\cal H}. Via disintegration, holonomic probabilities \hat{\nu} on [0,1]\times \Sigma are naturally associated to a \rho-weighted system. More precisely, there exist a probability \nu on [0,1] and u_i, i\in\{0, 1,2,..,d-1\} on [0,1], such that is P_{u}^*(\nu)=\nu. We consider holonomic ergodic probabilities. For a holonomic probability we define entropy. Finally, we analyze the problem: given \phi \in \mathbb{B}^{+}, find the solution of the maximization pressure problem p(\phi)=
