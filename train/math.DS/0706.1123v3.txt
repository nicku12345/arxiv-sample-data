Let f: S^2 \to S^2 be an expanding branched covering map of the sphere to itself with finite postcritical set P_f. Associated to f is a canonical quasisymmetry class \GGG(f) of Ahlfors regular metrics on the sphere in which the dynamics is (non-classically) conformal. We show \[ \inf_{X \in \GGG(f)} \hdim(X) \geq Q(f)=\inf_\Gamma \{Q \geq 2: \lambda(f_{\Gamma,Q}) \geq 1\}.\] The infimum is over all multicurves \Gamma \subset S^2-P_f. The map f_{\Gamma,Q}: \R^\Gamma \to \R^\Gamma is defined by \[ f_{\Gamma, Q}(\gamma) =\sum_{[\gamma']\in\Gamma} \sum_{\delta \sim \gamma'} \deg(f:\delta \to \gamma)^{1-Q}[\gamma'],\] where the second sum is over all preimages \delta of \gamma freely homotopic to \gamma' in S^2-P_f, and  \lambda(f_{\Gamma,Q}) is its Perron-Frobenius leading eigenvalue. This generalizes Thurston's observation that if Q(f)>2, then there is no f-invariant classical conformal structure.
