The global behaviour of nonlinear systems is extremely important in control and systems theory since the usual local theories will only give information about a system in some neighbourhood of an operating point. Away from that point, the system may have totally different behaviour and so the theory developed for the local system will be useless for the global one.   In this paper we shall consider the analytical and topological structure of systems on 2- and 3- manifolds and show that it is possible to obtain systems with 'arbitrarily strange' behaviour, i.e., arbitrary numbers of chaotic regimes which are knotted and linked in arbitrary ways. We shall do this by considering Heegaard Splittings of these manifolds and the resulting systems defined on the boundaries.
