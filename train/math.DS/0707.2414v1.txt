In this paper, we discuss delayed periodic dynamical systems, compare capability of criteria of global exponential stability in terms of various L^{p} (1\le p<\infty) norms. A general approach to investigate global exponential stability in terms of various L^{p} (1\le p<\infty) norms is given. Sufficient conditions ensuring global exponential stability are given, too. Comparisons of various stability criteria are given. More importantly, it is pointed out that sufficient conditions in terms of L^{1} norm are enough and easy to implement in practice.
