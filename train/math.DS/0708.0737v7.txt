Let F be a smooth vector field defined in a neighborhood of the origin in \mathbb{R}^n, F(O)=0, and let F_t be its local flow. Denote by E the set of germs of diffeomorphisms h:\mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^n preserving orbits of F and let E_{\mathrm{id}}^r be the identity component of E with respect to C^r-topology. Then every E_{\mathrm{id}}^{r} contains a subset Sh consisting of mappings of the form F_{f(x)}(x), where f: \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R} is a smooth function. It was proved earlier by the author that if F is a linear vector field, then Sh=E_{\mathrm{id}}^0. In this paper we present a class of vector fields for which Sh and E_{\mathrm{id}}^1 coincide on the level of \infty-jets. We also establish a parameter rigidity of linear vector fields and "reduced" Hamiltonian vector fields of real homogeneous polynomials in two variables.
