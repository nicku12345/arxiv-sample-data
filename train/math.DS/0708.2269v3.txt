We study quasi-periodic tori under a normal-internal resonance, possibly with multiple eigenvalues. Two non-degeneracy conditions play a role. The first of these generalizes invertibility of the Floquet matrix and prevents drift of the lower dimensional torus. The second condition involves a Kolmogorov-like variation of the internal frequencies and simultaneously versality of the Floquet matrix unfolding. We focus on the reversible setting, but our results carry over to the Hamiltonian and dissipative contexts.
