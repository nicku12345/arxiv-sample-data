Recently, the synchronization of coupled dynamical systems has been widely studied. Synchronization is referred to as a process wherein two (or many) dynamical systems are adjusted to a common behavior as time goes to infinity, due to coupling or forcing. Therefore, before discussing synchronization, a basic problem on continuation of the solution must be solved: For given initial conditions, can the solution of coupled dynamical systems be extended to the infinite interval [0,+\infty)? In this paper, we propose a general model of coupled dynamical systems, which includes previously studied systems as special cases, and prove that under the assumption of QUAD, the solution of the general model exists on [0,+\infty).
