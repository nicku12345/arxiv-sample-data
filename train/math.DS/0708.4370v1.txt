We afford the problem of counting the blocks of a given length made with symbols drawn from an alphabet and relate this number to Fibonacci-like recurrent relations. The recurrence polynomia allows to calculate the limit ratio of two adjacent terms and this information is used to determine the topological entropy of a discrete numbers of associate shift spaces. We then describe a scheme to build a shift space with a pre-selected entropy.
