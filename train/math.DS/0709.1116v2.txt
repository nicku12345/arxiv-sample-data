In this paper, we study the Arneodo-Coullet-Tresser map  F(x,y,z)=(ax-b(y-z), bx+a(y-z), cx-dx^k+e z) where a,b,c,d,e are real with bd\neq 0 and k>1 is an integer. We obtain stability regions for fixed points of F and symmetric period-2 points while c and e vary as parameters. Varying a and e as parameters, we show that there is a hyperbolic invariant set on which F is conjugate to the full shift on two or three symbols. We also show that chaotic behaviors of F while c and d vary as parameters and F is near an anti-integrable limit. Some numerical results indicates F has Hopf bifurcation, strange attractors, and nested structure of invariant tori.
