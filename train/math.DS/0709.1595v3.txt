In this note we consider a collection \cal{C} of one parameter families of unimodal maps of [0,1]. Each family in the collection has the form \{\mu f\} where \mu\in [0,1]. Denoting the kneading sequence of \mu f by K(\mu f), we will prove that for each member of \cal{C}, the map \mu\mapsto K(\mu f) is monotone. It then follows that for each member of \cal{C} the map \mu\mapsto h(\mu f) is monotone, where h(\u{f}) is the topological entropy of \mu f. For interest, \mu f(x)=4\mu x(1-x) and \mu f(x)=\mu\sin(\pi x) are shown to belong to \cal{C}. This extends the work of Masato Tsujii [1].
