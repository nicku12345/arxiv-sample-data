Let g:\mathbb{R}^2\to\mathbb{R} be a homogeneous polynomial of degree p>1, G=(-g'_{y}, g'_{x}) be its Hamiltonian vector field, and G_t be the local flow generated by G. Denote by E(G,O) the space of germs of C^{\infty} diffeomorphisms (\mathbb{R}^2,O)\to(\mathbb{R}^2,O) that preserve orbits of G. Let also E_{\mathrm{id}}(G,O) be the identity component of E(G,O) with respect to C^1-topology.   Suppose that g has no multiple prime factors. Then we prove that for every h\in E_{\mathrm{id}}(G,O) there exists a germ of a smooth function \alpha:\mathbb{R}^2\to\mathbb{R} at O such that h(z)=G_{\alpha(z)}(z).
