In this paper we prove the following renewal-type limit theorem. Given an irrational \alpha in (0,1) and R>0, let q_{n_R} be the first denominator of the convergents of \alpha which exceeds R. The main result in the paper is that the ratio q_{n_R}/R has a limiting distribution as R tends to infinity. The existence of the limiting distribution uses mixing of a special flow over the natural extension of the Gauss map.
