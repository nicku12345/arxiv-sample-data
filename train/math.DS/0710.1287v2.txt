We consider Birkhoff sums of functions with a singularity of type 1/x over rotations and prove the following limit theorem. Let S_N= S_N(\alpha,x) be the N^th non-renormalized Birkhoff sum, where x in [0,1) is the initial point, \alpha\in [0,1) is the rotation number and (\alpha, x) are uniformly distributed. We prove that S_N/N has a joint limiting distribution in (\alpha,x) as N tends to infinity. As a corollary, we get the existence of a limiting distribution for certain trigonometric sums.
