By using a suitable Banach space on which we let the transfer operator act, we make a detailed study of the ergodic theory of a unimodal map f of the interval in the Misiurewicz case. We show in particular that the absolutely continuous invariant measure \rho can be written as the sum of 1/square root spikes along the critical orbit, plus a continuous background. We conclude by a discussion of the sense in which the map f\mapsto\rho may be differentiable.
