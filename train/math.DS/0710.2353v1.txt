In this work we exhibit a new criteria for ergodicity of diffeomorphisms involving conditions on Lyapunov exponents and general position of some invariant manifolds. On one hand we derive uniqueness of SRB-measures for transitive surface diffeomorphisms. On the other hand, using recent results on the existence of blenders we give a positive answer, in the C^1 topology, to a conjecture of Pugh-Shub in the context of partially hyperbolic conservative diffeomorphisms with two dimensional center bundle.
