Our purpose in this paper is to study when a planar differential system polynomial in one variable linearizes in the sense that it has an inverse integrating factor which can be constructed by means of the solutions of linear differential equations. We give several families of differential systems which illustrate how the integrability of the system passes through the solutions of a linear differential equation. At the end of the work, we describe some families of differential systems which are Darboux integrable and whose inverse integrating factor is constructed using the solutions of a second--order linear differential equation defining a family of orthogonal polynomials.
