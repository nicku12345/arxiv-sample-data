Discrete dynamical systems defined on the state space {0,1,...,p-1}^n have been used in multiple applications, most recently for the modeling of gene and protein networks. In this paper we study to what extent well-known theorems by Smale and Hirsch, which form part of the theory of (continuous) monotone dynamical systems, generalize or fail to do so in the discrete case.   We show that that arbitrary m-dimensional systems cannot necessarily be embedded into n-dimensional cooperative systems for n=m+1, as in the Smale theorem for the continuous case, but we show that this is possible for n=m+2 as long as p is sufficiently large.   We also prove that a natural discrete analogue of strong cooperativity implies nontrivial bounds on the lengths of periodic orbits and imposes a condition akin to Lyapunov stability on all attractors. Finally, we explore several natural candidates for definitions of irreducibility of a discrete system. While some of these notions imply the strong cooperativity of a given cooperative system and impose even tighter bounds on the lengths of periodic orbits than strong cooperativity alone, other plausible definitions allow the existence of exponentially long periodic orbits.
