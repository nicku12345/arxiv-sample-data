In this article we study minimal homeomorphisms(all orbits are dense) of the tori T^{n}, n<5. The linear part of a homeomorphism \phi  of T^{n} is the linear mapping L induced by \phi  on the first homology group of T^{n}. It follows from the Lefschetz fixed point theorem that 1 is an eigenvalue of L if \phi  minimal. We show that if \phi  is minimal and n<5 then L is quasi-unipontent, i.e., all the eigenvalues of L are roots of unity and conversely if L\in GL(n,\Z) is quasi-unipotent and 1 is an eigenvalue of L then there exists a  C^{\infty} minimal skew-product diffeomorphism \phi  of T^{n} whose linear part is precisely L. We do not know if these results are true for n>4. We give a sufficient condition for a smooth skew-product diffeomorphism of a torus of arbitrary dimension to be smoothly conjugate to an affine transformation.
