We introduce a weak transversality condition for piecewise C^{1+\alpha} and piecewise hyperbolic maps which admit a C^{1+\alpha} stable distribution. We show good bounds on the essential spectral radius of the associated transfer operators acting on classical anisotropic Sobolev spaces of Triebel-Lizorkin type. In many cases, we obtain a spectral gap from which we deduce the existence of finitely many physical measures with basin of total measure. The analysis relies on standard techniques (in particular complex interpolation) and applies also to piecewise expanding maps and to Anosov diffeomorphisms, giving a unifying picture of several previous results.
