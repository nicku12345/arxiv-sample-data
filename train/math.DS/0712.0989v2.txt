Let (X,\mathcal{B}, \mu, T) be an ergodic dynamical system on a non-atomic finite measure space. We assume without loss of generality that \mu(X)=1. Consider the maximal function \dis R^*:(f, g) \in L^p\times L^q \to R^*(f, g)(x) = \sup_{n\geq 1} \frac{f(T^nx)g(T^{2n}x)}{n}. We obtain the following maximal inequality. For each 1<p\leq \infty there exists a finite constant C_p such that for each \lambda >0, and nonnegative functions f\in L^p and g\in L^1   \mu\{x: R^*(f,g)(x)>\lambda\} \leq   C_p \bigg(\frac{\|f\|_p\|g\|_1}{\lambda}\bigg)^{1/2}.   We also show that for each \alpha>2 the maximal function R^*(f,g) is a.e. finite for pairs of functions (f,g)\in (L(\log L)^{2\alpha}, L^1).
