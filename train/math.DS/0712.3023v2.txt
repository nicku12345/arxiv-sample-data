The thermodynamical formalism is studied for renormalisable maps of the interval and the natural potential -t \log|Df|. Multiple and indeed infinitely many phase transitions at positive t can occur for some quadratic maps. All unimodal quadratic maps with positive topological entropy exhibit a phase transition in the negative spectrum.
