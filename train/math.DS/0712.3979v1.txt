We introduce a notion of \ell-Volterra quadratic stochastic operator defined on (m-1)-dimensional simplex, where \ell\in\{0,1,...,m\}. The \ell-Volterra operator is a Volterra operator iff \ell=m. We study structure of the set of all \ell-Volterra operators and describe their several fixed and periodic points. For m=2 and 3 we describe behavior of trajectories of (m-1)-Volterra operators. The paper also contains many remarks with comparisons of \ell-Volterra operators and Volterra ones.
