This article proposes an initiation to \'Ecalle's mould calculus, a powerful combinatorial tool which yields surprisingly explicit formulas for the normalising series attached to an analytic germ of singular vector field. This is illustrated on the case of saddle-node singularities, generated by two-dimensional vector fields which are formally conjugate to Euler's vector field x^2\frac{\pa}{\pa x}+(x+y)\frac{\pa}{\pa y}, and for which the formal normalisation proves to be resurgent in 1/x.
