We prove that a certain family of flat surfaces in genus 3 does not fulfill Veech's Dichotomy. These flat surfaces provide uncountably many minimal but nonergodic directions. The conditions on this family are a combinatorical one and an irrationality condition. The Arnoux-Yoccoz surface fulfills this conditions.
