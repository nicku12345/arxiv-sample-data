We examine the itinerary of 0\in S^{1}=\R/\Z under the rotation by \alpha\in\R\bs\Q. The motivating question is: if we are given only the itinerary of 0 relative to I\subset S^{1}, a finite union of closed intervals, can we recover \alpha and I? We prove that the itineraries do determine \alpha and I up to certain equivalences. Then we present elementary methods for finding \alpha and I. Moreover, if g:S^{1}\to S^{1} is a C^{2}, orientation preserving diffeomorphism with an irrational rotation number, then we can use the orbit itinerary to recover the rotation number up to certain equivalences.
