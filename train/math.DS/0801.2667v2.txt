We investigate ergodic theory of Poisson suspensions. In the process, we establish close connections between finite and infinite measure preserving ergodic theory. Poisson suspensions thus provide a new approach to infinite measure preserving ergodic theory. Fields investigated here are mixing properties, spectral theory, joinings. We also compare Poisson suspensions to the apparently similar looking Gaussian dynamical systems.
