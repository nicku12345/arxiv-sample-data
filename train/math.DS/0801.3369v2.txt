The existence of equilibrium points and the effect of radiation pressure have been discussed numerically. The problem is generalized by considering bigger primary as a source of radiation and small primary as an oblate spheroid. We have also discussed the Poynting-Robertson(P-R) effect which is caused due to radiation pressure. It is found that the collinear points L_1,L_2,L_3 deviate from the axis joining the two primaries, while the triangular points L_4,L_5 are not symmetrical due to radiation pressure. We have seen that L_1,L_2,L_3 are linearly unstable while L_4,L_5 are conditionally stable in the sense of Lyapunov when P-R effect is not considered. We have found that the effect of radiation pressure reduces the linear stability zones while P-R effect induces an instability in the sense of Lyapunov.
