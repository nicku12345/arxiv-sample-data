We develop non-invertible Pesin theory for a new class of maps called cusp maps. These maps may have unbounded derivative, but nevertheless verify a property analogous to C^{1+\epsilon}. We do not require the critical points to verify a non-flatness condition, so the results are applicable to C^{1+\epsilon} maps with flat critical points. If the critical points are too flat, then no absolutely continuous invariant probability measure can exist. This generalises a result of Benedicks and Misiurewicz.
