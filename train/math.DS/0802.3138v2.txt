We study here weighted polynomial multiple ergodic averages. A sequence of weights is called universally good if any polynomial multiple ergodic average with this sequence of weights converges in L^{2}. We find a necessary condition and show that for any bounded measurable function \phi on an ergodic system, the sequence \phi(T^{n}x) is universally good for almost every x. The linear case was understood by Host and Kra.
