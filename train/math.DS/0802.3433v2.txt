Assume that x\in [0,1)  admits its continued fraction expansion x=[a_1(x), a_2(x),...]. The Khintchine exponent \gamma(x) of x is defined by \gamma(x):=\lim\limits_{n\to \infty}\frac{1}{n}\sum_{j=1}^n \log a_j(x) when the limit exists. Khintchine spectrum \dim E_\xi is fully studied, where  E_{\xi}:=\{x\in [0,1):\gamma(x)=\xi\} (\xi \geq 0) and \dim denotes the Hausdorff dimension. In particular, we prove the remarkable fact that the Khintchine spectrum \dim E_{\xi}, as function of \xi \in [0, +\infty), is neither concave nor convex. This is a new phenomenon from the usual point of view of multifractal analysis. Fast Khintchine exponents defined by \gamma^{\phi}(x):=\lim\limits_{n\to\infty}\frac{1}{\phi(n)} \sum_{j=1}^n \log a_j(x) are also studied, where \phi (n) tends to the infinity faster than n does. Under some regular conditions on \phi, it is proved that the fast Khintchine spectrum \dim (\{x\in [0,1]: \gamma^{\phi}(x)= \xi \})  is a constant function. Our method also works for other spectra like the Lyapunov spectrum and the fast Lyapunov spectrum.
