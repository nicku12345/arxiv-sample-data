We define observability and detectability for linear switching systems as the possibility of reconstructing and respectively of asymptotically reconstructing the hybrid state of the system from the knowledge of the output for a suitable choice of the control input. We derive a necessary and sufficient condition for observability that can be verified computationally. A characterization of control inputs ensuring observability of switching systems is given. Moreover, we prove that checking detectability of a linear switching system is equivalent to checking asymptotic stability of a suitable switching system with guards extracted from it, thus providing interesting links to Kalman decomposition and the theory of stability of hybrid systems.
