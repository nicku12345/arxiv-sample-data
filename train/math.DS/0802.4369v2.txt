We consider continuous extensions of minimal rotations on a locally connected compact group X by arbitrary locally compact Lie groups and prove regularity (i.e. the existence of orbit closures which project onto the whole basis X) in certain special situations beyond the already known nilpotent case. We further discuss an open question on cocycles acting on homogeneous spaces which seems to be the missing key for a general regularity theorem.
