We consider the static wall approximation to the dynamics of a particle bouncing on a periodically oscillating infinitely heavy plate while subject to a potential force. We assume the case of a potential given by a power of the particle's height and sinusoidal motions of the plate. We find that for powers smaller than 1 the set of escaping orbits has full Hausdorff dimension for all motions and obtain existence of elliptic island of period 2 for arbitrarily high energies for a full-measure set of motions. Moreover we obtain conditions on the potential to ensure that the total (Lebesgue) measure of elliptic islands of period 2 is either finite or infinite.
