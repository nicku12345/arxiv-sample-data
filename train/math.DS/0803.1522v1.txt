We study the multifractal analysis for smooth dynamical systems in dimension one. It is characterized the Hausdorff dimension of the level set obtained from the Birkhoff averages of a continuous function by the local dimensions of hyperbolic measures for a topologically mixing C^2 map modelled by an abstract dynamical system. A characterization which corresponds to above is also given for the ergodic basins of invariant probability measures. And it is shown that the complement of the set of quasi-regular points carries full Hausdorff dimension.
