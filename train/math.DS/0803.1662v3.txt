Dynamically stable periodic rotations of a driven pendulum provide a unique mechanism for generating a uniform rotation from bounded excitations. This paper studies the effects of a small ellipticity of the driving, perturbing the classical parametric pendulum. The first finding is that the region in the parameter plane of amplitude and frequency of excitation where rotations are possible increases with the ellipticity. Second, the resonance tongues, which are the most characteristic feature of the classical bifurcation scenario of a parametrically driven pendulum, merge into a single region of instability.
