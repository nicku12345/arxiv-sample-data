We give an equivalent characterisation for the existence of a semi-conjugacy to an irrational rotation for conservative homeomorphisms of the two-torus. This leads to an analogue of Poincare's classification of circle homeomorphisms for conservative toral homeomorphisms with unique rotation vector and a certain bounded mean motion property. For minimal toral homeomorphisms, the result extends to arbitrary dimensions. Further, we provide a basic classification for the dynamics of non-wandering toral homeomorphisms homotopic to the identitiy.
