We show that invariant submanifolds with boundary, and more generally with corners which are normally expanded by an endomorphism are persistent as a-regular stratifications. This result will be shown in class C^s, for s\ge 1. We present also a simple example of a submanifold with boundary which is normally expanded but non-persistent as a differentiable submanifold.
