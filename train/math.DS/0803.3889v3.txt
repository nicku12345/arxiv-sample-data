We show that Fatou components of a semi-hyperbolic rational map are John domains and that the converse does not hold. This generalizes a famous result of Carleson, Jones and Yoccoz.   We show that a connected Julia set is locally connected for a large class of non-uniformly hyperbolic rational maps. This class is more general than semi-hyperbolicity and includes Collet-Eckmann and Topological Collet-Eckmann maps and maps verifying a summability condition (as considered by Graczyk and Smirnov).
