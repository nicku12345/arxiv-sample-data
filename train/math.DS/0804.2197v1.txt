We study the parameter space of unicritical polynomials f_c:z\mapsto z^d+c. For complex parameters, we prove that for Lebesgue almost every c, the map f_c is either hyperbolic or infinitely renormalizable. For real parameters, we prove that for Lebesgue almost every c, the map f_c is either hyperbolic, or Collet-Eckmann, or infinitely renormalizable. These results are based on controlling the spacing between consecutive elements in the ``principal nest'' of parapuzzle pieces.
