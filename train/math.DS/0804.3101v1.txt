We present an unfolding of the codimension-two scenario of the simultaneous occurrence of a discontinuous bifurcation and an Andronov-Hopf bifurcation in a piecewise-smooth, continuous system of autonomous ordinary differential equations in the plane. We find the Hopf cycle undergoes a grazing bifurcation that may be very shortly followed by a saddle-node bifurcation of the orbit. We derive scaling laws for the bifurcation curves that emanate from the codimension-two bifurcation.
