We describe some recent results on the dynamics of singular-hyperbolic (or Lorenz-like) attractors: attractors in this class are expansive and so sensitive with respect to initial data; they admit a unique physical measure whose support is the whole attractor, which is hyperbolic and the equilibrium state with respect to the center-unstable Jacobian; the hitting time associated to a geometric Lorenz attractor satisfies a logarithm law; the rate of large deviations for the physical measure on the ergodic basin of a geometric Lorenz attractor is exponential.
