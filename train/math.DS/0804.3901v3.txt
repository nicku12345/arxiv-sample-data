Let L be a hyperbolic automorphism of \mathbb T^d, d\ge3. We study the smooth conjugacy problem in a small C^1-neighborhood \mathcal U of L.   The main result establishes C^{1+\nu} regularity of the conjugacy between two Anosov systems with the same periodic eigenvalue data. We assume that these systems are C^1-close to an irreducible linear hyperbolic automorphism L with simple real spectrum and that they satisfy a natural transitivity assumption on certain intermediate foliations.   We elaborate on the example of de la Llave of two Anosov systems on \mathbb T^4 with the same constant periodic eigenvalue data that are only H\"older conjugate. We show that these examples exhaust all possible ways to perturb C^{1+\nu} conjugacy class without changing periodic eigenvalue data. Also we generalize these examples to majority of reducible toral automorphisms as well as to certain product diffeomorphisms of \mathbb T^4 C^1-close to the original example.
