We confront existing definitions of chaos with the state of the art in topological dynamics. The article does not propose any new definition of chaos but, starting from several topological properties that can be reasonably called chaotic, tries to sketch a theoretical view of chaos. Among the main ideas in this article are the distinction between overall chaos and partial chaos, and the fact that some dynamical properties may be considered more chaotic than others.
