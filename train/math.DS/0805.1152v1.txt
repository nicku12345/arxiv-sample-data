We consider a real analytic diffeomorphism \psi_0 on a n-dimensional disk D, n >= 2, exhibiting a Feigenbaum-Coullet-Tresser (F.C.T.) attractor, being far, in the standard topology of the real analytic diffeomorphism space C(D), from the standard F.C.T. map \phi_0 fixed by the double renormalization. We prove that \psi_0 persists along a codimension-one manifold M \subset C(D), and that it is the bifurcating map along any one-parameter family in C(D) transversal to M, from diffeomorphisms attracted to sinks, to those which exhibit chaos. The main tool in the proofs is a theorem of Functional Analysis, which we state and prove in this paper, characterizing the existence of codimension one submanifolds in any abstract functional Banach space.
