For continuous maps on a compact manifold M, particularly for those that do not preserve the Lebesgue measure m, we define the observable invariant probability measures as a generalization of the physical measures. We prove that any continuous map has observable measures, and characterize those that are physical in terms of the observability. We prove that there exist physical measures whose basins cover Lebesgue a.e, if and only if the set of all observable measures is finite or infinite numerable. We define for any continuous map, its generalized attractors using the set of observable invariant measures where there is no physical measure, and prove that any continuous map defines a decomposition of the space in up to infinitely many generalized attractors whose basins cover Lebesgue a.e. We apply the results to the C1 expanding maps f in the circle, proving that the set of observable measures (even if f is not C1 plus Holder, is a subset of the equilibrium states.
