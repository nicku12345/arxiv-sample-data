We study differentiability of topological conjugacies between expanding piecewise C^{1+\epsilon} interval maps. If these conjugacies are not C^1, then they have zero derivative almost everywhere. We obtain the result that in this case the Hausdorff dimension of the set of points for which the derivative of the conjugacy does not exist lies strictly between zero and one. Using multifractal analysis and thermodynamic formalism, we show that this Hausdorff dimension is explicitly determined by the Lyapunov spectrum. Moreover, we show that these results give rise to a "rigidity dichotomy" for the type of conjugacies under consideration.
