A minimal subshift (X,T) is linearly recurrent if there exists a constant K so that for each clopen set U generated by a finite word u the return time to U, with respect to T, is bounded by K|u|. We prove that given a linearly recurrent subshift (X,T) the set of its non-periodic subshift factors is finite up to isomorphism. We also give a constructive characterization of these subshifts.
