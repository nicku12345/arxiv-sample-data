We present a modern proof of some extensions of the celebrated Hirsch-Pugh-Shub theorem on persistence of normally hyperbolic compact laminations. Our extensions consist of allowing the dynamics to be an endomorphism, of considering the complex analytic case and of allowing the laminations to be non compact. To study the analytic case, we use the formalism of deformations of complex structures. We present various persistent complex laminations which appear in dynamics of several complex variables: Henon maps, fibered holomorphic maps... In order to proof the persistence theorems, we construct a laminar structure on the stable and unstable of the normally hyperbolic laminations.
