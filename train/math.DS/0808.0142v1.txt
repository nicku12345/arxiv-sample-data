The purpose of this paper is to study ergodic averages with deterministic weights. More precisely we study the convergence of the ergodic averages of the type \frac{1}{N} \sum_{k=0}^{N-1} \theta (k) f \circ T^{u_k} where \theta = (\theta (k) ; k\in \NN) is a bounded sequence and u = (u_k ; k\in \NN) a strictly increasing sequence of integers such that for some \delta<1  S_N (\theta, u) := \sup_{\alpha \in \pRR} | \sum_{k=0}^{N-1} \theta (k) \exp (2i\pi \alpha u_k) | = O (N^{\delta}) \leqno{({\cal H}_1)}  i.e., there exists a constant C such that S_N (\theta, u) \leq C N^{\delta} . We define \delta (\theta, u) to be the infimum of the \delta  satisfying \H_1 for \theta  and u.
