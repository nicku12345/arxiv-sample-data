This paper is devoted to the study of limit laws of entrance times to cylinder sets for Cantor minimal systems of zero entropy using their representation by means of ordered Bratteli diagrams. We study in detail substitution subshifts and we prove these limit laws are piecewise linear functions. The same kind of results is obtained for classical low complexity systems given by non stationary ordered Bratteli diagrams.
