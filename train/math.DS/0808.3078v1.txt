The Decoration Conjecture describes the structure of the set of braid types of Smale's horseshoe map ordered by forcing, providing information about the order in which periodic orbits can appear when a horseshoe is created. A proof of this conjecture is given for the class of so-called lone decorations, and it is explained how to calculate associated braid conjugacy invariants which provide additional information about forcing for horseshoe braids.
