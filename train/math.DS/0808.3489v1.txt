Counting periodic orbits of endomorphisms on the 2-torus is considered, with special focus on the relation between global and local aspects and between the dynamical zeta function on the torus and its analogue on finite lattices. The situation on the lattices, up to local conjugacy, is completely determined by the determinant, the trace and a third invariant of the matrix defining the toral endomorphism.
