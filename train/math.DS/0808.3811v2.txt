We show that a cocycle has a dominated splitting if and only if there is a uniform exponential gap between singular values of its iterates. Then we consider sets \Sigma in GL(d,\mathbb{R}) with the property that any cocycle with values in \Sigma has a dominated splitting. We characterize these sets in terms of existence of invariant multicones, thus extending a 2-dimensional result by Avila, Bochi, and Yoccoz. We give an example showing how these multicones can fail to have convexity properties.
