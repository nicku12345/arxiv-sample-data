We show by means of a counterexample that a C^{1+Lip} diffeomorphism Holder conjugate to an Anosov diffeomorphism is not necessarily Anosov. The counterexample can bear higher smoothness up to C^3. Also we include a result from the 2006 Ph.D. thesis of T. Fisher: a C^{1+Lip} diffeomorphism Holder conjugate to an Anosov diffeomorphism is Anosov itself provided that Holder exponents of the conjugacy and its inverse are sufficiently large.
