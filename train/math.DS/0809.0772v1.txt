Using an aperiodic and repetitive subtree of the Cayley graph of the free Abelian group with two generators, described by Kenyon, Ghys has constructed an example of minimal Riemann surface lamination having both Euclidean and hyperbolic leaves. We prove that the transverse dynamics of this lamination is represented (in a measurable way) by a 2-adic odometer. In fact, we can describe its topological transverse dynamics, and prove that the Ghys-Kenyon lamination is affable.
