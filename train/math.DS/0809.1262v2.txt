We study the parameter space structure of degree d \ge 3 one complex variable polynomials as dynamical systems acting on \C. We introduce and study {\it straightening maps}. These maps are a natural higher degree generalization of the ones introduced by Douady and Hubbard to prove the existence of small copies of the Mandelbrot set inside itself. We establish that straightening maps are always injective and that their image contains all the corresponding hyperbolic systems. Also, we characterize straightening maps with compact domain. Moreover, we give two classes of bijective straightening maps. The first produces an infinite collection of embedded copies of the (d-1)-fold product of the Mandelbrot set in the connectedness locus of degree d \ge 3. The second produces an infinite collection of full families of quadratic connected filled Julia sets in the cubic connectedness locus, such that each filled Julia set is quasiconformally embedded.
