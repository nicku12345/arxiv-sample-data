We construct a resonant normal form for an area-preserving map near a generic resonant elliptic fixed point. The normal form is obtained by a simplification of a formal interpolating Hamiltonian. The resonant normal form is unique and therefore provides the formal local classification for area-preserving maps with the elliptic fixed point. The total number of formal invariants is infinite. We consider the cases of weak (of order n\ge5) and strong (of order n=3,4) resonances. We also construct unique normal forms for analytic families of area-preserving maps.   We note that our constructions involve non-linear grading functions.
