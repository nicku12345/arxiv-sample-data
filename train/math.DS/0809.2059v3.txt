We prove the existence and uniqueness, for wave speeds sufficiently large, of monotone traveling wave solutions connecting stable to unstable spatial equilibria for a class of N-dimensional lattice differential equations with unidirectional coupling. This class of lattice equations includes some spatial discretizations for hyperbolic conservation laws with a source term as well as a subclass of monotone systems. We obtain a variational characterization of the critical wave speed above which monotone traveling wave solutions are guaranteed to exist. We also discuss non-monotone waves, and the coexistence of monotone and non-monotone waves.
