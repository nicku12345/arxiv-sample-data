We derive the multifractal analysis of the conformal measure (or equivalently, the invariant measure) associated to a family of weights imposed upon a (multi-dimensional) graph directed Markov system (GDMS) using balls as the filtration. This analysis is done over a large subset of the limit set. In particular, it coincides with the limit set when the GDMS under scrutiny satisfies a boundary separation condition. It also applies to more general situations such as real or complex continued fractions.
