We generalize various notions of stability of invariant sets of dynamical systems to invariant measures, by defining a topology on the set of measures. The defined topology is similar, but not topologically equivalent to weak* topology, and it also differs from topologies induced by the Riesz Representation Theorem. It turns out that the constructed topology is a solution of a limit case of a p-optimal transport problem, for p=\infty.
