Let f be a homeomorphism of the closed annulus A that preserves orientation, boundary components and that has a lift \tilde f to the infinite strip \tilde A which is transitive. We show that, if the rotation number of both boundary components of A is strictly positive, then there exists a closed nonempty connected set \Gamma\subset\tilde A such that \Gamma\subset]-\infty,0]\times[0,1], \Gamma is unlimited, the projection of \Gamma to A is dense, \Gamma-(1,0)\subset\Gamma and \tilde{f}(\Gamma)\subset \Gamma. Also, if p_1 is the projection in the first coordinate in \tilde A, then there exists d>0 such that, for any \tilde z\in\Gamma, \limsup_{n\to\infty}\frac{p_1(\tilde f^n(\tilde z))-p_1(\tilde z)}{n}<-d.   In particular, using a result of Franks, we show that the rotation set of any homeomorphism of the annulus that preserves orientation, boundary components, which has a transitive lift without fixed points in the boundary is an interval with 0 in its interior.
