Let X and Y be Polish spaces with non-atomic Borel measures \mu and \nu of full support. Suppose that T and S are ergodic non-singular homeomorphisms of (X,\mu) and (Y,\nu) with continuous Radon-Nikodym derivatives. Suppose that either they are both of type III_1 or that they are both of type III_\lambda, 0<\lambda<1 and, in the III_\lambda case, suppose in addition that both `topological asymptotic ranges' (defined in the article) are \log\lambda\cdot\Bbb Z. Then there exist invariant dense G_\delta-subsets X'\subset X and Y'\subset Y of full measure and a non-singular homeomorphism \phi: X' \to Y' which is an orbit equivalence between T|_{X'} and S|_{Y'}, that is \phi\{T^{i}x\} = \{S^{i}x\} for all x \in X'. Moreover the Radon-Nikodym derivative d\nu\circ\phi/d\mu is continuous on X' and, letting S' = \phi^{-1}S \phi we have Tx= {S'}^{n(x)}x and S' = T^{m(x)}x where n and m are continuous on X'.
