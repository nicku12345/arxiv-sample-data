Truncated Taylor series representations of invariant manifolds are abundant in numerical computations. We present an aposteriori method to compute the convergence radii and error estimates of analytic parametrisations of non-resonant local invariant manifolds of a saddle of an analytic vector field, from such a truncated series. This enables us to obtain local enclosures, as well as existence results, for the invariant manifolds.
