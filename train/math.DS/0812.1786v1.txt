Pulse-coupled threshold units serve as paradigmatic models for a wide range of complex systems. When the state variable of a unit crosses a threshold, the unit sends a pulse that is received by other units, thereby mediating the interactions. At the same time, the state variable of the sending unit is reset. Here we study pulse-coupled models with a reset that may be partial only and is mediated by a partial reset function. Such a partial reset characterizes intrinsic physical or biophysical features of a unit (e.g., resistive coupling between dendrite and soma of compartmental neurons) and at the same time makes possible a rigorous mathematical investigation of the collective network dynamics.   The partial reset acts as a desynchronization mechanism. For all-to-all pulse-coupled oscillators an increase in the strength of the partial reset causes a sequence of desynchronizing bifurcations from the fully synchronous state via states with large clusters of synchronized units through states with smaller clusters to complete asynchrony. We analytically derive sufficient and necessary conditions for the existence and stability of periodic cluster states on the local dynamics of the oscillators and on the partial reset function to reveal the mechanism underlying the desynchronization transition. We show that the entire sequence may occur due to arbitrarily small changes of the partial reset and is robust against structural perturbations.
