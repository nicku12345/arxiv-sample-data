We prove that a Lebesgue measure-preserving linked-twist map defined in the plane is metrically isomorphic to a Bernoulli shift (and thus strongly mixing). This is the first such result for an explicitly defined linked-twist map on a manifold other than the two-torus. Our work builds on that of Wojtkowski who established an ergodic partition for this example using an invariant cone-field in the tangent space.
