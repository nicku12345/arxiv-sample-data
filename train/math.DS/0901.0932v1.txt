The classical theorem of Birkhoff states that the T^N f(x) = (1/N)\sum_{k=0}^{N-1} f(\sigma^k x) converges almost everywhere for x\in X and f\in L^{1}(X), where \sigma is a measure preserving transformation of a probability measure space X. It was shown that there are operators of the form T^N f(x)=(1/N)\sum_{k=0}^{N-1}f(\sigma^{n_k}x) for a subsequence \{n_k\} of the positive integers that converge in some L^p spaces while diverging in others. The topic of this talk will examine this phenomenon in the class of Orlicz spaces \{L{Log}^\beta L:\beta>0\}.
