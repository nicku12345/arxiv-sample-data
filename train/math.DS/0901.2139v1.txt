Let f:M\to M be a C^{1+\epsilon}-map on a smooth Riemannian manifold M and let \Lambda\subset M be a compact f-invariant locally maximal set. In this paper we obtain several results concerning the distribution of the periodic orbits of f|\Lambda. These results are non-invertible and, in particular, non-uniformly hyperbolic versions of well-known results by Bowen, Ruelle, and others in the case of hyperbolic diffeomorphisms.   We show that the topological pressure P_{\rm top}(\varphi) can be computed by the values of the potential \varphi on the expanding periodic orbits and also that every hyperbolic ergodic invariant measure is well-approximated by expanding periodic orbits. Moreover, we prove that certain equilibrium states are Bowen measures. Finally, we derive a large deviation result for the periodic orbits whose time averages are apart from the space average of a given hyperbolic invariant measure.
