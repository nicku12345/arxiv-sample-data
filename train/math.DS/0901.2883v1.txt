Let us give a two dimensional family of real vector fields. We suppose that there exists a stationary point where the linearized vector field has successively a stable focus, an unstable focus and an unstable node. When the parameter moves slowly, a bifurcation delay appears due to the Hopf bifurcation. The studied question in this article is the continuation of the delay after the focus-node bifurcation.
