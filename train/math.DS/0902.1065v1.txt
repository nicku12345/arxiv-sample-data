We prove that the boundary of a component U of the basin of an attracting periodic cycle (of period greater than 1) for an exponential map on the complex plane has Hausdorff dimension greater than 1 and less than 2. Moreover, the set of points in the boundary of U which do not escape to infinity has Hausdorff dimension (in fact: hyperbolic dimension) greater than 1, while the set of points in the boundary of U which escape to infinity has Hausdorff dimension 1.
