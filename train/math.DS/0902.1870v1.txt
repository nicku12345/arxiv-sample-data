In 1967, Ross and Str\"omberg published a theorem about pointwise limits of orbital integrals for the left action of a locally compact group G onto (G,\rho), where \rho is the right Haar measure. In this paper, we study the same kind of problem, but more generally for left actions of G onto any measured space (X,\mu), which leaves the \sigma-finite measure \mu relatively invariant, in the sense that s\mu = \Delta(s)\mu for every s\in G, where \Delta is the modular function of G. As a consequence, we also obtain a generalization of a theorem of Civin, relative to one-parameter groups of measure preserving transformations. The original motivation for the circle of questions treated here dates back to classical problems concerning pointwise convergence of Riemann sums relative to Lebesgue integrable functions.
