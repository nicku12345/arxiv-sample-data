We consider diffeomorphisms in the C^\infty-closure of the conjugancy class of translations of the 2-torus. By a theorem of Fathi and Herman, a generic diffeomorphism in that space is minimal and uniquely ergodic. We define a new mixing-like property, which takes into account the "directions" of mixing, and we prove that generic elements of the space in question satisfy this property. As a consequence, we show that there is a residual set of strictly ergodic diffeomorphisms without invariant foliations of any kind. We also obtain an analytic version of these results.
