It is shown that there exists an \alpha-rigid transformation with \alpha less or equal to \frac12 whose spectrum has Lebesgue component. This answers the question raised by Klemes and Reinhold in \cite{Klemes-Reinhold}. We exhibit also a large class of \alpha-rigid transformations with singular spectrum.
