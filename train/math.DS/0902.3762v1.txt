In this paper we consider invertible one-dimensional linear cellular automata (CA hereafter) defined on a finite alphabet of cardinality p^k, i.e. the maps T_{f[l,r]}:\mathbb{Z}^{\mathbb{Z}}_{p^k}\to\mathbb{Z}^{\mathbb{Z}}_{p^k} which are given by T_{f[l,r]}(x) = (y_n)_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} , y_{n} = f(x_{n+l}, ..., x_{n+r}) =\overset{r}{\underset{i=l}{\sum}}\lambda _{i}x_{n+i}(\text{mod} p^k), x=(x_n)_{n=-\infty}^{\infty}\in \mathbb{Z}^{\mathbb{Z}}_{p^k} and f:\mathbb{Z}^{r-l+1}_{p^k}\to \mathbb{Z}_{p^k}, over the ring \mathbb{Z}_{p^k} (k \geq 2 and p is a prime number), where gcd(p,\lambda_r)=1 and p| \lambda_i for all i \neq r  (or gcd(p, \lambda_l)=1 and p|\lambda_i for all i\neq l). Under some assumptions we prove that any right (left) permutative, invertible one-dimensional linear CA T_{f[l,r]} and its inverse are strong mixing. We also prove that any right(left) permutative, invertible one-dimensional linear CA is Bernoulli automorphism without making use of the natural extension previously used in the literature.
