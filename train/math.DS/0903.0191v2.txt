A weakly continuous near-action of a Polish group G on a standard Lebesgue measure space (X,\mu) is whirly if for every A\subseteq X of strictly positive measure and every neighbourhood V of identity in G the set VA has full measure. This is a strong version of ergodicity, and locally compact groups never admit whirly actions. On the contrary, every ergodic near-action by a Polish L\'evy group in the sense of Gromov and Milman, such as U(\ell^2), is whirly (Glasner--Tsirelson--Weiss). We give examples of closed subgroups of the group \Aut(X,\mu) of measure preserving automorphisms of a standard Lebesgue measure space (with the weak topology) whose tautological action on (X,\mu) is whirly, and which are not L\'evy groups, thus answering a question of Glasner and Weiss.
