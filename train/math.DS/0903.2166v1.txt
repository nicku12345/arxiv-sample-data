We consider iterated function systems on the interval with random perturbation. Let Y_\epsilon be uniformly distributed in [1- \epsilon, 1 + \epsilon] and let f_i \in C^{1+\alpha} be contractions with fixpoints a_i. We consider the iterated function system \{Y_\epsilon f_i + a_i (1 - Y_\epsilon) \}_{i=1}^n, were each of the maps are chosen with probability p_i. It is shown that the invariant density is in L^2 and the L^2-norm does not grow faster than 1/\sqrt{\epsilon}, as \epsilon vanishes.
