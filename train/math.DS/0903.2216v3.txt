We study the orthogonal projections of a large class of self-affine carpets, which contains the carpets of Bedford and McMullen as special cases. Our main result is that if \Lambda is such a carpet, and certain natural irrationality conditions hold, then every orthogonal projection of \Lambda in a non-principal direction has Hausdorff dimension \min(\gamma,1), where \gamma is the Hausdorff dimension of \Lambda. This generalizes a recent result of Peres and Shmerkin on sums of Cantor sets.
