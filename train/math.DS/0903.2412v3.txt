Symmetry analysis of Ermakov systems has attracted enormous treatments in recent times. In this paper we consider three classes of the Ermakov systems and obtain their nonlocal symmetries using a simple algebraic reduction process. We observed that these nonlocal symmetries are new to the literature.
