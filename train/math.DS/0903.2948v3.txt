Let f: M \to M be a C^r-diffeomorphism, r\geq 1, defined on a compact boundaryless d-dimensional manifold M, d\geq 2, and let H(p) be the homoclinic class associated to the hyperbolic periodic point p. We prove that if there exists a C^1 neighborhood \mathcal{U} of f such that for every g\in {\mathcal U} the continuation H(p_g) of H(p) is entropy-expansive then there is a Df-invariant dominated splitting for H(p) of the form E\oplus F_1\oplus... \oplus F_c\oplus G where E is contracting, G is expanding and all F_j are one dimensional and not hyperbolic.
