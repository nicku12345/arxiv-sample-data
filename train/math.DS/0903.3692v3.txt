We show that a class of robustly transitive diffeomorphisms originally described by Ma\~{n}\'{e} are intrinsically ergodic. More precisely we obtain an open set of diffeomorphisms which fail to be uniformly hyperbolic, but nevertheless have constant entropy and isomorphic unique measures of maximal entropy.
