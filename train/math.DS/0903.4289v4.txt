We continue the study of straightening maps for the family of polynomials of degree d \ge 3. The notion of straightening map is originally introduced by Douady and Hubbard to study relationship between polynomial-like renormalizations and self-similarity of the Mandelbrot set. In the quadratic case, straightening maps are always continuous, and this is one of the critical steps to prove the Mandelbrot set has small copies in itself.   On the other hand, for higher degree case, we do not have such a nice self-similar property: As expected from an example of a cubic-like family with discontinuous straightening map by Douady and Hubbard, we prove that the straightening map is discontinuous unless it is of disjoint type.
