We describe a fundamental domain for the punctured Riemann surface V_{3,m} which parametrises (up to M\"obius conjugacy) the set of quadratic rational maps with numbered critical points, such that the first critical point has period three, and such that the second critical point is not mapped in m iterates or less to the periodic orbit of the first. This gives, in turn, a description, up to topological conjugacy, of all dynamics in all type III hyperbolic components in V_{3}, and gives indications of a topological model for V_{3}, together with the hyperbolic components contained in it.
