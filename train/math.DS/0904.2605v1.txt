Ermakov systems have attracted enormous treatments in recent times particularly in symmetry analysis. In this paper we consider three classes of the Ermakov systems by using a simple algebraic reduction process with imposed conditions on the magnitude of the angular momentum of each system class to obtain new generalized symmetries. We note that this imposed condition transforms the Kepler-Ermakov systems to the generalized Ermakov systems.
