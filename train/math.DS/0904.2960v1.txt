Most differential equations found in chemical reaction networks (CRNs) have the form dx/dt=f(x)= Sv(x), where x lies in the nonnegative orthant, where S is a real matrix (the stoichiometric matrix) and v is a column vector consisting of real-valued functions having a special relationship to S. Our main interest will be in the Jacobian matrix, f'(x), of f(x), in particular in whether or not each entry f'(x)_{ij} has the same sign for all x in the orthant, i.e., the Jacobian respects a sign pattern. In other words species x_j always acts on species x_i in an inhibitory way or its action is always excitatory.   In Helton, Klep, Gomez we gave necessary and sufficient conditions on the species-reaction graph naturally associated to S which guarantee that the Jacobian of the associated CRN has a sign pattern. In this paper, given S we give a construction which adds certain rows and columns to S, thereby producing a stoichiometric matrix \widehat S corresponding to a new CRN with some added species and reactions. The Jacobian for this CRN based on \hat S has a sign pattern. The equilibria for the S and the \hat S based CRN are in exact one to one correspondence with each equilibrium e for the original CRN gotten from an equilibrium \hat e for the new CRN by removing its added species. In our construction of a new CRN we are allowed to choose rate constants for the added reactions and if we choose them large enough the equilibrium \hat e is locally asymptotically stable if and only if the equilibrium e is locally asymptotically stable. Further properties of the construction are shown, such as those pertaining to conserved quantities and to how the deficiencies of the two CRNs compare.
