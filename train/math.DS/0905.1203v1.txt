A sequence of non-negative integers is exactly realizable as the fixed point counts sequence of a dynamical system if and only if it gives rise to a sequence of non-negative orbit counts. This provides a simple realizability criterion based on the transformation between fixed point and orbit counts. Here, we extend the concept of exact realizability to realizability of integer sequences as differences of the two fixed point counts sequences originating from a dynamical system and a topological factor. A criterion analogous to the one for exact realizability is given and the structure of the resulting set of integer sequences is outlined.
