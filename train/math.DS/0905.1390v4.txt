It is known that the famous Feigenbaum-Coullet-Tresser period doubling universality has a counterpart for area-preserving maps of {\fR}^2. A renormalization approach has been used in \cite{EKW1} and \cite{EKW2} in a computer-assisted proof of existence of a "universal" area-preserving map F_* -- a map with orbits of all binary periods 2^k, k \in \fN. In this paper, we consider maps in some neighbourhood of F_* and study their dynamics.   We first demonstrate that the map F_* admits a "bi-infinite heteroclinic tangle": a sequence of periodic points \{z_k\}, k \in \fZ, |z_k| \converge{{k \to \infty}} 0, \quad |z_k| \converge{{k \to -\infty}} \infty, whose stable and unstable manifolds intersect transversally; and, for any N \in \fN, a compact invariant set on which F_* is homeomorphic to a topological Markov chain on the space of all two-sided sequences composed of N symbols. A corollary of these results is the existence of {\it unbounded} and {\it oscillating} orbits.   We also show that the third iterate for all maps close to F_* admits a horseshoe. We use distortion tools to provide rigorous bounds on the Hausdorff dimension of the associated locally maximal invariant hyperbolic set:  0.7673 \ge {\rm dim}_H(\cC_F) \ge \varepsilon \approx 0.00044 e^{-1797}.
