Let T be a competitive map on a rectangular region \mathcal{R}\subset \mathbb{R}^2, and assume T is C^1 in a neighborhood of a fixed point \bar{\rm x}\in \mathcal{R}. The main results of this paper give conditions on T that guarantee the existence of an invariant curve emanating from \bar{\rm x} when both eigenvalues of the Jacobian of T at \bar{\rm x} are nonzero and at least one of them has absolute value less than one, and establish that \mathcal{C} is an increasing curve that separates \mathcal{R} into invariant regions. The results apply to many hyperbolic and nonhyperbolic cases, and can be effectively used to determine basins of attraction of fixed points of competitive maps, or equivalently, of equilibria of competitive systems of difference equations. Several applications to planar systems of difference equations with non-hyperbolic equilibria are given.
