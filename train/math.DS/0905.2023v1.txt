We consider the basic model of virus dynamics in the modeling of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), in a 2D heterogenous environment. It consists of two ODEs for the non-infected and infected CD_4^+ T lymphocytes, T and I, and a parabolic PDE for the virus V. We define a new parameter \lambda_0 as an eigenvalue of some Sturm-Liouville problem, which takes the heterogenous reproductive ratio into account. For \lambda_0<0 the trivial non-infected solution is the only equilibrium. When \lambda_0>0, the former becomes unstable whereas there is only one positive infected equilibrium. Considering the model as a dynamical system, we prove the existence of a universal attractor. Finally, in the case of an alternating structure of viral sources, we define a homogenized limiting environment. The latter justifies the classical approach via ODE systems.
