We show that under some natural ergodicity assumptions extensions given by Rokhlin cocycles lift the multiplier property if the associated locally compact group extension has only countably many L^\infty-eigenvalues. We make use of some analogs of basic results from the theory of finite-rank modules associated to an extension of measure-preserving systems in the setting of a non-singular base.
