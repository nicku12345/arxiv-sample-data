It is known that the famous Feigenbaum-Coullet-Tresser period doubling universality has a counterpart for area-preserving maps of {\fR}^2. A renormalization approach has been used in \cite{EKW1} and \cite{EKW2} in a computer-assisted proof of existence of a "universal" area-preserving map F_* -- a map with orbits of all binary periods 2^k, k \in \fN. In this paper, we consider {\it infinitely renormalizable} maps -- maps on the renormalization stable manifold in some neighborhood of F_* -- and study their dynamics.   For all such infinitely renormalizable maps in a neighborhood of the fixed point F_* we prove the existence of a "stable" invariant set \cC^\infty_F such that the maximal Lyapunov exponent of F \arrowvert_{\cC^\infty_F} is zero, and whose Hausdorff dimension satisfies {\rm dim}_H(\cC_F^{\infty}) \le 0.5324.   We also show that there exists a submanifold, \bW_\omega, of finite codimension in the renormalization local stable manifold, such that for all F\in\bW_\omega the set \cC^\infty_F is "weakly rigid": the dynamics of any two maps in this submanifold, restricted to the stable set \cC^\infty_F, is conjugated by a bi-Lipschitz transformation that preserves the Hausdorff dimension.
