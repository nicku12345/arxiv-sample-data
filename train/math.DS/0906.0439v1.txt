Let h be a without fixed point lift to the plane of a homeomorphism of the open annulus isotopic to the identity and without wandering point. We show that h admits a h-invariant dense open set O on which it is conjugate to a translation and we study the action of h on the compactly connected components of the closed and without interior set {\bf R}^2 \setminus O.
