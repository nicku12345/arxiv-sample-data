We show that every partially hyperbolic diffeomorphism with a 1-dimensional center bundle has a principal symbolic extension. On the other hand, we show there are no symbolic extensions C^1-generically among diffeomorphisms containing non-hyperbolic robustly transitive sets with center indecomposable bundle of dimension at least 2.
