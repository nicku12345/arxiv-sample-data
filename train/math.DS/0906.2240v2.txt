We prove a criteria for uniform hyperbolicity based on the periodic points of the transformation. More precisely, if a mild (non uniform) hyperbolicity condition holds for the periodic points of any diffeomorphism in a residual subset of a C^1-open set \SU then there exists an open and dense subset \SA\subset \SU of Axiom A diffeomorphisms. Moreover, we also prove a noninvertible version of Ergodic Closing Lemma which we use to prove a counterpart of this result for local diffeomorphisms. As a simple corollary of our techniques, we have that an arbitrary \mathrm{C}^1-class local diffeomorphism f of a closed manifold M^n is uniformly expanding on the closure \mathrm{Cl}_{M^n}(\mathrm{Per}(f)) of its periodic point set \mathrm{Per}(f), if it is nonuniformly expanding on \mathrm{Per}(f).
