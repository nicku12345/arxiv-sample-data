Heaviness refers to a sequence of partial sums maintaining a certain lower bound and was recently introduced and studied in "Heaviness: and Extension of a Lemma of Y. Peres." After a review of basic properties to familiarize the reader with the ideas of heaviness, general principles of heaviness in symbolic dynamics are introduced. The classical Morse sequence is used to study a specific example of heaviness in a system with nontrivial rational eigenvalues. To contrast, Sturmian sequences are examined, including a new condition for a sequence to be Sturmian.
