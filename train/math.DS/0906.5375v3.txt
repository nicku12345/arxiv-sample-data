Let T be a piecewise expanding interval map and T_H be an abstract perturbation of T into an interval map with a hole. Given a number \ell, 0<\ell<1, we compute an upper-bound on the size of a hole needed for the existence of an absolutely continuous conditionally invariant measure (accim) with escape rate not greater than -\ln(1-\ell). The two main ingredients of our approach are Ulam's method and an abstract perturbation result of Keller and Liverani.
