The existence and bifurcation of homoclinic orbits in planar piecewise linear homogeneous systems with two regions separated by a discontinuity boundary are investigated in this paper. In addition, existence of periodic orbits and stability of the origin are also discussed without the assumption of continuity for the planar piecewise linear homogeneous systems.
