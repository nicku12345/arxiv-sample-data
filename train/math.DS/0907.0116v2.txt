We study the class of entire transcendental maps of finite order with one critical point and one asymptotic value, which has exactly one finite pre-image, and having a persistent Siegel disc. After normalisation this is a one parameter family f_a with a\in\mathbb{C}^* which includes the semi-standard map \lambda ze^z at a=1, approaches the exponential map when a\to0 and a quadratic polynomial when a\to\infty. We investigate the stable components of the parameter plane (capture components and semi-hyperbolic components) and also some topological properties of the Siegel disc in terms of the parameter.
