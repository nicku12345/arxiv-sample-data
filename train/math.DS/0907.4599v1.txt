Let F: \mathbb R \to \mathbb R be a real analytic increasing diffeomorphism with F-{\rm Id} being 1 periodic. Consider the translated family of maps (F_t :\mathbb R \to \mathbb R)_{t\in \mathbbR} defined as F_t(x)=F(x)+t. Let {\rm Trans}(F_t) be the translation number of F_t defined by: \[{\rm Trans}(F_t) := \lim_{n\to +\infty}\frac{F_t^{\circ n}-{\rm Id}}{n}.\] Assume there is a Herman ring of modulus 2\tau associated to F and let p_n/q_n be the n-th convergent of {\rm Trans}(F). Denoting \ell_{\theta} as the length of the interval \{t\in \mathbb R | {\rm Trans}(F_t)=\theta\}, we prove that the sequence (\ell_{p_n/q_n}) decreases exponentially fast with respect to q_n. More precisely \[\limsup_{n \to \infty} \frac{1}{q_n} \log {\ell_{p_n/q_n}} \le -2\pi \tau .\]
