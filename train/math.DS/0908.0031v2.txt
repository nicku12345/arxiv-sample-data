In this paper, we mainly use the Galerkin approximation method and the iteration inequalities of the L-Maslov type index theory to study the properties of brake subharmonic solutions for the first order non-autonomous Hamiltonian systems. We prove that when the positive integers j and k satisfies the certain conditions, there exists a jT-periodic nonconstant brake solution z_{j} such that z_{j} and z_{kj} are distinct.
