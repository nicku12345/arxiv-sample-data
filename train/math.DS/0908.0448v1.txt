We consider a smooth two-parameter family f_{a,L}\colon\theta\mapsto \theta+a+L\Phi(\theta) of circle maps with a finite number of critical points. For sufficiently large L we construct a set A_L^{(\infty)} of a-values of positive Lebesgue measure for which the corresponding f_{a,L} exhibits an exponential growth of derivatives along the orbits of the critical points. Our construction considerably improves the previous one of Wang and Young for the same class of families, in that the following asymptotic estimate holds: the Lebesgue measure of A_L^{(\infty)} tends to full measure in a-space as L tends to infinity.
