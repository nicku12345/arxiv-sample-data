Let {\mathcal F}_I=\{f:I \to I| f(x)= (Ax+B)/(Cx+D); AD-BC \neq 0 \}, where I is an interval. For x\in I, let {\Omega}_x be the orbit of x under the action of the semigroup of functions generated by f,g \in {\mathcal F}_I. Our main result in this paper is to describe all f,g \in {\mathcal F}_I such that \Omega_x is dense in I for all x.
