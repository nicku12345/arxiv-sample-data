We study the dynamics of complex polynomials. We obtain results on Poincare return maps defined on certain neighborhoods of a point with bounded orbit under a polynomial. We introduce a generalization of the Yoccoz tau-function, the Yoccoz return function, which codes the returns of a critical point with bounded orbit of any complex polynomial with a disconnect Julia set. We give necessary conditions on Yoccoz return functions, which allow for the recursive definition of an abstract tau-function. These conditions are also sufficient for polynomials that have a disconnected Julia set and exactly one critical point with bounded orbit.
