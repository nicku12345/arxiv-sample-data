We prove that there is a residual subset \mathcal{S} in \text{Diff}^1(M) such that, for every f\in \mathcal{S}, any homoclinic class of f with invariant one dimensional central bundle containing saddles of different indices (i.e. with different dimensions of the stable invariant manifold) coincides with the support of some invariant ergodic non-hyperbolic (one of the Lyapunov exponents is equal to zero) measure of f.
