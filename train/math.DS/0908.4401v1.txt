In this paper we established the condition for a curve to satisfy stochastic generalized fractional HP (Hamilton-Pontryagin) equations. These equations are described using Ito integral. We have also considered the case of stochastic generalized fractional Hamiltonian equations, for a hyperregular Lagrange function. From the stochastic generalized fractional Hamiltonian equations, Langevin generalized fractional equations were found and numerical simulations were done.
