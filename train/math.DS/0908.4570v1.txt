We consider a partially hyperbolic set K on a Riemannian manifold M whose tangent space splits as T_K M=E^{cu}\oplus E^{s}, for which the centre-unstable direction E^{cu} expands non-uniformly on some local unstable disk. We show that under these assumptions f induces a Gibbs-Markov structure. Moreover, the decay of the return time function can be controlled in terms of the time typical points need to achieve some uniform expanding behavior in the centre-unstable direction. As an application of the main result we obtain certain rates for decay of correlations, large deviations, an almost sure invariance principle and the validity of the Central Limit Theorem.
