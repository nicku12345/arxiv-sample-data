We prove a structure theorem for topologically conservative real skew product extensions of distal minimal compact metric \Z-flows. The main result states that every such extension can be represented by a perturbation of a Rokhlin skew product. Moreover, we give certain counterexamples to point out that all components of the construction are in fact inevitable.
