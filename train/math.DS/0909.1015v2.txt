Recently R\"ussmann proposed a new new variant of KAM theory based on a slowly converging iteration scheme. It is the purpose of this note to make this scheme accessible in an even simpler setting, namely for analytic perturbations of constant vector fields on a torus. As a side effect the result may be the shortest complete KAM proof for perturbations of integrable vector fields available so far.
