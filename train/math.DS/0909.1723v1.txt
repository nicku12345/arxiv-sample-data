In this article, we study finite dynamical systems defined over graphs, where the functions are applied asynchronously. Our goal is to quantify and understand stability of the dynamics with respect to the update sequence, and to relate this to structural properties of the graph. We introduce and analyze three different notions of update sequence stability, each capturing different aspects of the dynamics. When compared to each other, these stability concepts yield vastly different conclusions regarding the relationship between stability and graph structure, painting a more complete picture of update sequence stability.
