We prove two relative local variational principles of topological pressure functions P(T,\mathcal{F},\mathcal{U},y) andP(T,\mathcal{F},\mathcal{U}|Y) for a given factor map \pi, an open cover \mathcal{U}  and a subadditive sequence of real-valued continuous functions \mathcal{F}. By proving the upper semi-continuity and affinity of the entropy maps h_{\{\cdot\}}(T,\mathcal{U}\mid Y) and h^+_{\{\cdot\}}(T,\mathcal{U}\mid Y) on the space of all invariant Borel probability measures, we show that the relative local pressure P(T,\mathcal{\{\cdot\}},\mathcal{U}|Y) for subadditive potentials determines the local measure-theoretic conditional entropies.
