Let \alpha\in(0,1) be an irrational, and [0;a_1,a_2,...] the continued fraction expansion of \alpha. Let H_{\alpha,V} be the one-dimensional Schr\"odinger operator with Sturm potential of frequency \alpha. Suppose the potential strength V is large enough and (a_i)_{i\ge1} is bounded. We prove that the spectral generating bands possess properties of bounded distortion, bounded covariation and there exists Gibbs-like measure on the spectrum \sigma(H_{\alpha,V}). As an application, we prove that \dim_H \sigma(H_{\alpha,V})=s_*,\quad \bar{\dim}_B \sigma(H_{\alpha,V})=s^*, where s_* and s^* are lower and upper pre-dimensions.
