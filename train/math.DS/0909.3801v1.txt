A Hamiltonian level, say a pair (H,e) of a Hamiltonian H and an energy e \in \mathbb{R}, is said to be Anosov if there exists a connected component \mathcal{E}_{H,e} of H^{-1}({e}) which is uniformly hyperbolic for the Hamiltonian flow X_H^t. The pair (H,e) is said to be a Hamiltonian star system if there exists a connected component \mathcal{E}^\star_{H,e} of the energy level H^{-1}({{e}}) such that all the closed orbits and all the critical points of \mathcal{E}^\star_{H,e} are hyperbolic, and the same holds for a connected component of the energy level \tilde{H}^{-1}({\tilde{e}}), close to \mathcal{E}^\star_{H,e}, for any Hamiltonian \tilde{H}, in some C^2-neighbourhood of H, and \tilde{e} in some neighbourhood of e.   In this article we prove that for any four-dimensional Hamiltonian star level (H,e) if the surface \mathcal{E}^\star_{H,e} does not contain critical points, then X_H^t|_{\mathcal{E}^\star_{H,e}} is Anosov; if \mathcal{E}^\star_{H,e} has critical points, then there exists \tilde{e}, arbitrarily close to e, such that X_H^t|_{\mathcal{E}^\star_{H,\tilde{e}}} is Anosov.
