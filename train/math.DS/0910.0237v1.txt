In this paper we extend certain central results of zero dimensional systems to higher dimensions. The first main result shows that if (Y,f) is a finitely presented system, then there exists a Smale space (X,F) and a u-resolving factor map \pi_+: X\to Y. If the finitely presented system is transitive, then we show there is a canonical minimal u-resolving Smale space extension. Additionally, we show that any finite-to-one factor map between transitive finitely presented systems lifts through u-resolving maps to an s-resolving map.
