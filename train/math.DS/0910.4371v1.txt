This paper is concerned with realizing Lattes maps as subdivision maps of finite subdivision rules. The main result is that the Lattes maps in all but finitely many analytic conjugacy classes can be realized as subdivision maps of finite subdivision rules with one tile type. An example is given of a Lattes map which is not the subdivision map of a finite subdivision rule with either i) two tile types and 1-skeleton of the subdivision complex a circle or ii) one tile type.
