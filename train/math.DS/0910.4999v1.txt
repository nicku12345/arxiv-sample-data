We study the asymptotics, box dimension, and Minkowski content of trajectories of some discrete dynamical systems. We show that under very general conditions, trajectories corresponding to parameters where saddle-node bifurcation appears have box dimension equal to 1/2, while those corresponding to period-doubling bifurcation parameter have box dimension equal to 2/3. Furthermore, all these trajectories are Minkowski nondegenerate. The results are illustrated in the case of logistic map.
