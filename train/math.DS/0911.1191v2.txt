In 1954 Marstrand proved that if K is a subset of R^2 with Hausdorff dimension greater than 1, then its one-dimensional projection has positive Lebesgue measure for almost-all directions. In this article, we give a combinatorial proof of this theorem when K is the product of regular Cantor sets of class C^{1+a}, a>0, for which the sum of their Hausdorff dimension is greater than 1.
