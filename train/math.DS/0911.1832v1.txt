Denote by \Gamma the set of pointwise good sequences. Those are sequences of real numbers (a_k) such that for any measure preserving flow (U_t)_{t\in \mathbb R} on a probability space and for any f\in L^\infty, the averages \frac{1}{n} \sum_{k=1}^{n} f(U_{a_k}x)  converge almost everywhere.   We prove the following two results. [1.] If f: (0,\infty)\to\mathbb R is continuous and if \big(f(ku+v)\big)_{k\geq 1}\in\Gamma for all u, v>0, then f is a polynomial on some subinterval J\subset (0,\infty) of positive length. [2.] If f: [0,\infty)\to\mathbb R is real analytic and if \big(f(ku)\big)_{k\geq 1}\in\Gamma for all u>0, then f is a polynomial on the whole domain [0,\infty). These results can be viewed as converses of Bourgain's polynomial ergodic theorem which claims that every polynomial sequence lies in \Gamma.
