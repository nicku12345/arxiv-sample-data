We study holomorphic germs f:(\mathbb{C}^2, 0) \rightarrow (\mathbb{C}^2,0) with non-invertible differential df_0. In order to do this, we search for a modification \pi:X \rightarrow (\mathbb{C}^2,0) (i.e., a composition of point blow-ups over the origin), and an infinitely near point p \in \pi^{-1}(0), such that the germ f lifts to a holomorphic germ \hat{f}:(X,p) \rightarrow (X,p) which is rigid (i.e., the generalized critical set of \hat{f} is totally invariant and has normal crossings at p). We extend a previous result for superattracting germs to the general case, and deal with the uniqueness of this process in the semi-superattracting case (\operatorname{Spec}(df_0)=\{0, \lambda\} with \lambda \neq 0). We specify holomorphic normal forms for the nilpotent case and for the type (0,\mathbb{D}), that is \operatorname{Spec}(df_0)=\{0, \lambda\} with \lambda in the unitary disk \mathbb{D} \subset \mathbb{C}, and formal normal forms for the type (0, \mathbb{C} \setminus \mathbb{D}).
