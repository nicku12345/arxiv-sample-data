The Kuramoto-Daido model, which describes synchronization phenomena, is a system of ordinary differential equations on N-torus defined as coupled harmonic oscillators, whose natural frequencies are drawn from some distribution function. In this paper, the continuous model for the Kuramoto-Daido model is introduced and the linear stability of its trivial solution (incoherent solution) is investigated. Kuramoto's transition point K_c, at which the incoherent solution changes the stability, is derived for an arbitrary distribution function for natural frequencies. It is proved that if the coupling strength K is smaller than K_c, the incoherent solution is asymptotically stable, while if K is larger than K_c, it is unstable.
