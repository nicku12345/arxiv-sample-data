Let I\subset\mathbb{R} be an interval and T_a:[0,1]\to[0,1], a\in I, a one-parameter family of piecewise expanding maps such that for each a\in I the map T_a admits a unique absolutely continuous invariant probability measure \mu_a. We establish sufficient conditions on such a one-parameter family such that a given point x\in[0,1] is typical for \mu_a for a full Lebesgue measure set of parameters a, i.e.  \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}\delta_{T_a^i(x)} \overset{\text{weak-}*}{\longrightarrow}\mu_a,\qquad\text{as} n\to\infty,  for Lebesgue almost every a\in I. In particular, we consider C^{1,1}(L)-versions of \beta-transformations, skew tent maps, and Markov structure preserving one-parameter families. For the skew tent maps we show that the turning point is almost surely typical.
