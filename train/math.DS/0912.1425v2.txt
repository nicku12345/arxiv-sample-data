We compute explicitly the action of the group of affine diffeomorphisms on the relative homology of two remarkable origamis discovered respectively by Forni (in genus 3) and Forni-Matheus (in genus 4). We show that, in both cases, the action on the non trivial part of the homology is through finite groups. In particular, the action on some 4-dimensional invariant subspace of the homology leaves invariant a root system of D_4 type. This provides as a by-product a new proof of (slightly stronger versions of) the results of Forni and Matheus: the non trivial Lyapunov exponents of the Kontsevich-Zorich cocycle for the Teichmuller disks of these two origamis are equal to zero.
