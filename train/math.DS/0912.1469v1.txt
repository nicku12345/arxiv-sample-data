For piecewise C^1 interval maps possibly containing critical points and discontinuities with negative Schwarzian derivative, under two summability conditions on the growth of the derivative and recurrence along critical orbits, we prove the nonexistence of wandering intervals, the existence of absolutely continuous invariant measures, and the bounded backward contraction property. The proofs are based on the method of proving the existence of absolutely continuous invariant measures of unimodal map, developed by Nowicki and van Strien.
