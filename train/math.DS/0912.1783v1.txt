For a continuous self-map T of a compact metrizable space with finite topological entropy, the order of accumulation of entropy of T is a countable ordinal that arises in the theory of entropy structure and symbolic extensions. Given any compact manifold M and any countable ordinal \al, we construct a continuous, surjective self-map of M having order of accumulation of entropy \al. If the dimension of M is at least 2, then the map can be chosen to be a homeomorphism.
