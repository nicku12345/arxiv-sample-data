We prove that \mathcal{C}^2 surface diffeomorphisms have symbolic extensions, i.e. topological extensions which are subshifts over a finite alphabet. Following the strategy of T.Downarowicz and A.Maass \cite{Dow} we bound the local entropy of ergodic measures in terms of Lyapunov exponents. This is done by reparametrizing Bowen balls by contracting maps in a approach combining hyperbolic theory and Yomdin's theory.
