We extend constructions of Hahn-Katznelson and Pavlov to Z^d-actions on symbolic dynamical spaces with prescribed topological and ergodic properties. More specifically, we describe a method to build Z^d-actions which are (totally) minimal, (totally) strictly ergodic and have positive topological entropy.
