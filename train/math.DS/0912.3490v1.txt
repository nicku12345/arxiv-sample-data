Consider a family of planar systems depending on two parameters (n,b) and having at most one limit cycle. Assume that the limit cycle disappears at some homoclinic (or heteroclinic) connection when \Phi(n,b)=0. We present a method that allows to obtain a sequence of explicit algebraic lower and upper bounds for the bifurcation set {\Phi(n,b)=0}. The method is applied to two quadratic families, one of them is the well-known Bogdanov-Takens system. One of the results that we obtain for this system is the bifurcation curve for small values of n, given by b=\frac5 7 n^{1/2}+{72/2401}n- {30024/45294865}n^{3/2}- {2352961656/11108339166925} n^2+O(n^{5/2}). We obtain the new three terms from purely algebraic calculations, without evaluating Melnikov functions.
