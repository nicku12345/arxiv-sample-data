In this paper, we attempt to define and understand the orbits of the Koch snowflake fractal billiard KS. This is a priori a very difficult problem because \partial(KS), the snowflake curve boundary of KS, is nowhere differentiable, making it impossible to apply the usual law of reflection at any point of the boundary of the billiard table. Consequently, we view the prefractal billiards KS_n (naturally approximating KS from the inside) as rational polygonal billiards and examine the corresponding flat surfaces of KS_n, denoted by \mathcal{S}_{KS_n}. In order to develop a clearer picture of what may possibly be happening on the billiard KS, we simulate billiard trajectories on KS_n (at first, for a fixed n\geq 0). Such computer experiments provide us with a wealth of questions and lead us to formulate conjectures about the existence and the geometric properties of periodic orbits of KS and detail a possible plan on how to prove such conjectures.
