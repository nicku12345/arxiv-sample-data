We present three examples to illustrate that in the continuation of a family of normally hyperbolic C^1 manifolds, the normal hyperbolicity may break down as the continuation parameter approaches a critical value even though the corresponding generalized Lyapunov-type numbers remain uniformly bounded below their critical values throughout the process. In the first example, a C^1 manifold still exists at the critical parameter value, but it is no longer normally hyperbolic. In the other two examples, at the critical parameter value the family of C^1 manifolds converges to a nonsmooth invariant set, for which generalized Lyapunov-type numbers are undefined.
