Let F(u)=h be an operator equation in a Banach space X, \|F'(u)-F'(v)\|\leq \omega(\|u-v\|), where \omega\in C([0,\infty)), \omega(0)=0, \omega(r)>0 if r>0, \omega(r) is strictly growing on [0,\infty). Denote A(u):=F'(u), where F'(u) is the Fr\'{e}chet derivative of F, and A_a:=A+aI. Assume that (*) \|A^{-1}_a(u)\|\leq \frac{c_1}{|a|^b}, |a|>0, b>0, a\in L. Here a may be a complex number, and L is a smooth path on the complex a-plane, joining the origin and some point on the complex a-plane, 0<|a|<\epsilon_0, where \epsilon_0>0 is a small fixed number, such that for any a\in L estimate (*) holds. It is proved that the DSM (Dynamical Systems Method) \bee \dot{u}(t)=-A^{-1}_{a(t)}(u(t))[F(u(t))+a(t)u(t)-f],\quad u(0)=u_0,\ \dot{u}=\frac{d u}{dt}, \eee converges to y as t\to +\infty, where a(t)\in L, F(y)=f, r(t):=|a(t)|, and r(t)=c_4(t+c_2)^{-c_3}, where c_j>0 are some suitably chosen constants, j=2,3,4. Existence of a solution y to the equation F(u)=f is assumed. It is also assumed that the equation F(w_a)+aw_a-f=0 is uniquely solvable for any f\in X, a\in L, and \lim_{|a|\to 0,a\in L}\|w_a-y\|=0.
