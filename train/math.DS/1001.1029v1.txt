Let M be a closed 3-manifold that supports a partially hyperbolic diffeomorphism f. If \pi_1(M) is nilpotent, the induced action of f on H_1(M, R) is partially hyperbolic. If \pi_1(M) is almost nilpotent or if \pi_1(M) has subexponential growth, M is finitely covered by a circle bundle over the torus. If \pi_1(M) is almost solvable, M is finitely covered by a torus bundle over the circle. Furthermore, there exist infinitely many hyperbolic 3-manifolds that do not support dynamically coherent partially hyperbolic diffeomorphisms; this list includes the Weeks manifold.   If f is a strong partially hyperbolic diffeomorphism on a closed 3-manifold M and if \pi_1(M) is nilpotent, then the lifts of the stable and unstable foliations are quasi-isometric in the universal of M. It then follows that f is dynamically coherent.   We also provide a sufficient condition for dynamical coherence in any dimension. If f is center bunched and if the center-stable and center-unstable distributions are Lipschitz, then the partially hyperbolic diffeomorphism f must be dynamically coherent.
