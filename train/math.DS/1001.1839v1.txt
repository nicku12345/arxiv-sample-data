We introduce a class of coded systems that we construct from sofic systems and Dyck shifts and we study a class of subshifts that we obtain by excluding words of length two from Dyck shifts. We derive expressions for zeta functions and topological entropy. We derive an expression for the zeta function of certain subshifts that we obtain by excluding words from Dyck shifts and of certain subshifts that we obtain by excluding words from the subshifts that are constructed from full shifts and Dyck shifts.
