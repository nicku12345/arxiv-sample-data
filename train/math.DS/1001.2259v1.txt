It is shown that for each N>0 and for a wide class of Abelian non-compact locally compact second countable groups G including all infinite countable discrete ones and \Bbb R^{d_1}\times\Bbb Z^{d_2} with d_1,d_2\ge 0, there exists a weakly mixing probability preserving G-action with a homogeneous spectrum of multiplicity N.
