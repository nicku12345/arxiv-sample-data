We consider 1-dimensional, unimodular Pisot substitution tilings with three intervals, and discuss conditions under which pairs of such tilings are locally isomorhphic (LI), or mutually locally derivable (MDL). For this purpose, we regard the substitutions as homomorphisms of the underlying free group with three generators. Then, if two substitutions are conjugated by an inner automorphism of the free group, the two tilings are LI, and a conjugating outer automorphism between two substitutions can often be used to prove that the two tilings are MLD. We present several examples illustrating the different phenomena that can occur in this context. In particular, we show how two substitution tilings can be MLD even if their substitution matrices are not equal, but only conjugate in GL(n,\mathbb{Z}). We also illustrate how the (in our case fractal) windows of MLD tilings can be reconstructed from each other, and discuss how the conjugating group automorphism affects the substitution generating the window boundaries.
