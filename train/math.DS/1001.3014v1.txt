Consider piecewise linear Lorenz maps on [0, 1] of the following form \[ f_{a,b,c}(x)= {ll} ax+1-ac & x \in [0, c) b(x-c) & x \in (c, 1].\] We prove that f_{a,b,c} admits an absolutely continuous invariant probability measure (acim) \mu with respect to the Lebesgue measure if and only if f_{a,b,c}(0) \le f_{a,b,c}(1), i.e. ac+(1-c)b \ge 1. The acim is unique and ergodic unless f_{a,b,c} is conjugate to a rational rotation. The equivalence between the acim and the Lebesgue measure is also fully investigated via the renormalization theory.
