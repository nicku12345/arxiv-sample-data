Oseledets' celebrated Multiplicative Ergodic Theorem (MET) is concerned with the exponential growth rates of vectors under the action of a linear cocycle on R^d. When the linear actions are invertible, the MET guarantees an almost-everywhere pointwise splitting of R^d into subspaces of distinct exponential growth rates (called Lyapunov exponents). When the linear actions are non-invertible, Oseledets' MET only yields the existence of a filtration of subspaces, the elements of which contain all vectors that grow no faster than exponential rates given by the Lyapunov exponents. The authors recently demonstrated that a splitting over R^d is guaranteed even without the invertibility assumption on the linear actions. Motivated by applications of the MET to cocycles of (non-invertible) transfer operators arising from random dynamical systems, we demonstrate the existence of an Oseledets splitting for cocycles of quasi-compact non-invertible linear operators on Banach spaces.
