Given a factor code \pi from a one-dimensional shift of finite type X onto an irreducible sofic shift Y, if \pi is finite-to-one there is an invariant called the degree of \pi which is defined the number of preimages of a typical point in Y. We generalize the notion of the degree to the class degree which is defined for any factor code on a one-dimensional shift of finite type. Given an ergodic measure \nu on Y, we find an invariant upper bound on the number of ergodic measures on X which project to \nu and have maximal entropy among all measures in the fibre \pi^{-1}\{\nu\}. We show that this bound and the class degree of the code agree when \nu is ergodic and fully supported. One of the main ingredients of the proof is a uniform distribution property for ergodic measures of relative maximal entropy.
