In this paper we formulate and prove a structure theorem for area preserving diffeomorphisms of genus zero surfaces with zero entropy. As an application we relate the existence of faithful actions of a finite index subgroup of the mapping class group of a closed surface \Sigma_g on S^2 by area preserving diffeomorphisms to the existence of finite index subgroups of bounded mapping class groups MCG(S, \partial S) with non-trivial first cohomology.
