We show that under quite general conditions, various multifractal spectra may be obtained as Legendre transforms of functions T\colon \RR\to \RR arising in the thermodynamic formalism. We impose minimal requirements on the maps we consider, and obtain partial results for any continuous map f on a compact metric space. In order to obtain complete results, the primary hypothesis we require is that the functions T be continuously differentiable. This makes rigorous the general paradigm of reducing questions regarding the multifractal formalism to questions regarding the thermodynamic formalism. These results hold for a broad class of measurable potentials, which includes (but is not limited to) continuous functions. We give applications that include most previously known results, as well as some new ones.
