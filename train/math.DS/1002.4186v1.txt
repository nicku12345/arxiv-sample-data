We extend the renormalisation operator introduced in \cite{dCML} from period-doubling H\'enon-like maps to H\'enon-like maps with arbitrary stationary combinatorics. We show the renormalisation picture holds also holds in this case if the maps are taken to be \emph{strongly dissipative}. We study infinitely renormalisable maps F and show they have an invariant Cantor set \mathcal{O} on which F acts like a p-adic adding machine for some p>1. We then show, as for the period-doubling case in \cite{dCML}, the sequence of renormalisations have a universal form, but the invariant Cantor set \mathcal{O} is non-rigid. We also show \mathcal{O} cannot possess a continuous invariant line field.
