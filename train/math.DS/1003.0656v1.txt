This paper deals with the dynamics of time-reversible Hamiltonian vector fields with 2 and 3 degrees of freedom around an elliptic equilibrium point in presence of symplectic involutions. The main results discuss the existence of one-parameter families of reversible periodic solutions terminating at the equilibrium. The main techniques used are Birkhoff and Belitskii normal forms combined with the Liapunov-Schmidt reduction.
