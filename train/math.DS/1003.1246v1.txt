We prove that every closed "general" trajectory of the control system \Sigma_M has an open neighborhood on which \Sigma_M is controllable if 1) this orbit contains some point where the Lie algebra rank condition (LARC) is satisfied, and 2) the set of control vectors is "involved" at q. In particular, for the control systems \Sigma_M on the compact connected manifold M^n with an open control set this gives the following "Closed Orbit Controllability Criterium": The dynamical system \Sigma_M of the considered type is controllable on M^n if and only if for an arbitrary point q of M^n there exists a closed trajectory of the control system going through this point. We also present examples which show that our conditions are necessary.
