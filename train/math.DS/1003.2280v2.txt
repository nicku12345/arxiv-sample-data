We present new examples of generic diffeomorphisms without attractors. Also, we study how these wild classes are accumulated by infinitely many other classes (obtaining that the chain recurrence classes different from the only quasi-attractor are contained in center stable manifolds). The construction relies on some derived from Anosov (DA) constructions and uses strongly the semiconjugacy obtained by these diffeomorphisms. An interesting feature of this examples is that we can show that robustly, they present a unique attractor in the sense of Milnor.
