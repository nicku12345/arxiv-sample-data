Let \{S_i\}_{i=1}^{l} be an iterated function system(IFS) on \mathbb{R}^d with attractor K. Let \pi be the canonical projection. In this paper we define a new concept called "projection pressure" P_\pi(\phi) for \phi\in C(\mathbb{R}^d) under certain affine IFS, and show the variational principle about the projection pressure. Furthermore we check that the unique zero root of "projection pressure" still satisfies Bowen's equation when each S_i is the similar map with the same compression ratio. Using the root of Bowen's equation, we can get the Hausdorff dimension of the attractor K.
