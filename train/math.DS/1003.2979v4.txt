In this paper we prove a multifractal formalism of Birkhoff averages for interval maps with countably many branches. Furthermore, we prove that under certain regularity assumptions on the potential the Birkhoff spectrum is real analytic. Applications of these results to number theory are also given. Finally, we compute the Hausdorff dimension of the set of points for which the Birkhoff average is infinite.
