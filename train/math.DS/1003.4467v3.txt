Thurston introduced \si_d-invariant laminations (where \si_d(z) coincides with z^d:\ucirc\to \ucirc, d\ge 2) and defined \emph{wandering k-gons} as sets \T\subset \ucirc such that \si_d^n(\T) consists of k\ge 3 distinct points for all n\ge 0 and the convex hulls of all the sets \si_d^n(\T) in the plane are pairwise disjoint. He proved that \si_2 has no wandering k-gons. Call a lamination with wandering k-gons a \emph{WT-lamination}. In a recent paper it was shown that uncountably many cubic WT-laminations, with pairwise non-conjugate induced maps on the corresponding quotient spaces J, are realizable as cubic polynomials on their (locally connected) Julia sets. In the present paper we use a new approach to construct cubic WT-laminations with all of the above properties and the extra property that the corresponding wandering branch point of J has a dense orbit in each subarc of J (we call such orbits \emph{condense}), and to show that critical portraits corresponding to such laminations are uncountably dense in the space \A_3 of all cubic critical portraits.
