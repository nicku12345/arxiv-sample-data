In this paper we deal with the following family of exponential maps (f_\lambda:z\mapsto \lambda(e^z-1))_{\lambda\in [1,+\infty)}. Denoting d(\lambda) the hyperbolic dimension of f_\lambda. It is known that the function \lambda\mapsto d(\lambda) is real analytic in (1,+\infty), and that it is continuous in [1,+\infty). In this paper we prove that this map is C^1 on [1,+\infty), with d'(1^+)=0. Moreover, depending on the value of d(1), we give estimates of the speed of convergence towards 0.
