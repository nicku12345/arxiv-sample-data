In this paper we give a geometric description of the foliation of a generic real analytic family unfolding a real analytic vector field with a weak focus at the origin, and show that two such families are orbitally analytically equivalent if and only if the families of diffeomorphisms unfolding the complexified Poincar\'e map of the singularities are conjugate. Moreover, by shifting the leaves of the formal normal form in the blow-up (quasiconformal surgery) by means of a fibered transformation along a convenient complex cross-section, one constructs an abstract manifold of complex dimension 2 equipped with an elliptic holomorphic foliation whose monodromy map coincides with a given family of admissible diffeomorphisms.
