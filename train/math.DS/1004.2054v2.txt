We study homoclinic orbits of the Swift-Hohenberg equation near a Hamiltonian-Hopf bifurcation. It is well known that in this case the normal form of the equation is integrable at all orders. Therefore the difference between the stable and unstable manifolds is exponentially small and the study requires a method capable to detect phenomena beyond all algebraic orders provided by the normal form theory. We propose an asymptotic expansion for an homoclinic invariant which quantitatively describes the transversality of the invariant manifolds. We perform high-precision numerical experiments to support validity of the asymptotic expansion and evaluate a Stokes constant numerically using two independent methods.
