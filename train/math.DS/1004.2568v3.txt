The goal of this work is to study the space of continuous functions whose ergodic averages converge everywhere towards a continuous function. We will connect, as in the case of a metric study, the convergence of the ergodic averages and the projection of continuous functions on the subspace of invariant functions. We will see that this determines the continuity of the projection of the system onto a certain factor.
