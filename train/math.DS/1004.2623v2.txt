The goal of this paper is to analyze two measure preserving transformation of combinatorial and number-theoretical origin from the point of view of ergodic orbit theory. We study the Morse transformation (in its adic realization in the group \textbf{Z}_2 of integer dyadic numbers, as described by the author [{\sl J. Sov. Math.} {\textbf{28}}, 667-674 (1985); {\sl St. Petersburg Math. J.} {\textbf{6}} (1995), no. 3, 529-540]) and prove that it has the same orbit partition as the dyadic odometer. Then we give a precise description of time substitution of the odometer, which produces the Morse transformation. It is convenient to describe this time substitution in the form of random re-orderings of the group \mathbb Z, or in terms of random infinite permutations of the group \mathbb Z. We introduce the notion of {\it locally finite permutations (LFP) or locally finite bijection (LFB), and uniformly locally finite time substitution (ULFTS)} for the group \mathbb Z (and for all amenable groups). Two automorphisms which have the same orbit partitions are called {\it allied} if the time substitution of one to another is ULFTS. Our main result is that the Morse transformation and the odometer are allied. The theory of random infinite permutations on the group \mathbb Z (and on more general groups) is as strong as the ergodic theory of actions of the group. The main task in this area is the investigation of infinite permutations, and measures on the space of infinite permutations, as well as the study of linear orderings on \mathbb Z. The class of locally finite permutations is a useful class for such an analysis.
