We discuss recent progress in understanding the dynamical properties of partially hyperbolic diffeomorphisms that preserve volume. The main topics addressed are density of stable ergodicity and stable accessibility, center Lyapunov exponents, pathological foliations, rigidity, and the surprising interrelationships between these notions.
