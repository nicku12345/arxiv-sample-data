In the paper we throw the first light on studying systematically the local entropy theory for a countable discrete amenable group action. For such an action, we introduce entropy tuples in both topological and measure-theoretic settings and build the variational relation between these two kinds of entropy tuples by establishing a local variational principle for a given finite open cover. Moreover, based the idea of topological entropy pairs, we introduce and study two special classes of such an action: uniformly positive entropy and completely positive entropy. Note that in the building of the local variational principle, following Romagnoli's ideas two kinds of measure-theoretic entropy are introduced for finite Borel covers. These two kinds of entropy turn out to be the same, where Danilenko's orbital approach becomes an inevitable tool.
