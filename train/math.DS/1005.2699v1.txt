The system considered in this paper consists of two equations (k=1,2) \dot x(t)=(-1)^{k-1} (0\le t<\infty),\,k(0)=1,\,x(0)=0,\,x(t)\not\in\{0,1\}(-1\le t<0), that change mutually in every instant t for which x(t-\tau)\in\{0,1\}, where \tau={\rm const}>0 is given. In this paper the behavior of the solutions is characterized for every \tau\in(4/3, 3/2), i. e. in case not covered in \cite{ADM}; as it was noted there, this behavior turned out to be more complex then when \tau\in(3/2,\infty). Thus the behavior of the solutions of this system with critical set K=\{0,1\} is characterized for every \tau>0.
