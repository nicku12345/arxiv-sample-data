The topological classification of the inner mappings on the fully invariant regular components of the wandering set with a special attracting boundary up to the topological conjugacy is defined in terms of distinguishing graph. Two inner mappings of the same degree are topologically equivalent on their fully invariant regular components of a certain class if and only if their distinguishing graphs are equivalent.
