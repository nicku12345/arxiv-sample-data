This paper presents a novel Long Baseline (LBL) position and velocity navigation filter for underwater vehicles based directly on the sensor measurements. The solution departs from previous approaches as the range measurements are explicitly embedded in the filter design, therefore avoiding inversion algorithms. Moreover, the nonlinear system dynamics are considered to their full extent and no linearizations are carried out whatsoever. The filter error dynamics are globally asymptotically stable (GAS) and it is shown, under simulation environment, that the filter achieves similar performance to the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) and outperforms linear position and velocity filters based on algebraic estimates of the position obtained from the range measurements.
