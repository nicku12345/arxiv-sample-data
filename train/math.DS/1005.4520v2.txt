For q\geq 3, we let \mathcal{S}_q denote the projectivization of the set of symmetric q\times q matrices with coefficients in \mathbb{C}. We let I(x)=(x_{i,j})^{-1} denote the matrix inversion, and we let J(x)=(x_{i,j}^{-1}) be the matrix whose entries are the reciprocals of the entries of x. We let K|\mathcal{S}_q=I\circ J:\mathcal{S}_q\rightarrow \mathcal{S}_q denote the restriction of the composition I\circ J to \mathcal{S}_q. This is a birational map whose properties have attracted some attention in statistical mechanics. In this paper we compute the degree complexity of K|\mathcal{S}_q, thus confirming a conjecture of Angles d'Auriac, Maillard, and Viallet in [J. Phys. A: Math. Gen. 39 (2006), 3641--3654].
