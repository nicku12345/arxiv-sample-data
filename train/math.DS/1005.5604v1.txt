We give a simple proof of Kolmogorov's theorem on the persistence of a quasiperiodic invariant torus in Hamiltonian systems. The theorem is first reduced to a well-posed inversion problem (Herman's normal form) by switching the frequency obstruction from one side of the conjugacy to another. Then the proof consists in applying a simple, well suited, inverse function theorem in the analytic category, which itself relies on the Newton algorithm and on interpolation inequalities. A comparison with other proofs is included in appendix.
