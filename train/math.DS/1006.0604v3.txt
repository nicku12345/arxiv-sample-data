Let \phi(x) = |1 - \frac 1x| for all x > 0. Then we extend \phi(x) in the usual way to become a continuous map from the compact topological (but not metric) space [0, \infty] onto itself which also maps the set of irrational points in (0, \infty) onto itself. In this note, we show that (1) on [0, \infty], \phi(x) is topologically mixing, has dense irrational periodic points, and has topological entropy \log \lambda, where \lambda is the unique positive zero of the polynomial x^3 - 2x -1; (2) \phi(x) has bounded uncountable {\it invariant} 2-scrambled sets of irrational points in (0, 3); (3) for any countably infinite set X of points (rational or irrational) in (0, \infty), there exists a dense unbounded uncountable {\it invariant} \infty-scrambled set Y of irrational transitive points in (0, \infty) such that, for any x \in X and any y \in Y, we have \limsup_{n \to \infty} |\phi^n(x) - \phi^n(y)| = \infty and \liminf_{n \to \infty} |\phi^n(x) - \phi^n(y)| = 0. This demonstrates the true nature of chaos for \phi(x).
