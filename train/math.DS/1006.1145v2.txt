In this note we consider dynamical systems (X,G) on a Cantor set X satisfying some mild technical conditions. The considered class includes, in particular, minimal and transitive aperiodic systems. We prove that two such systems (X_1,G_1) and (X_2,G_2) are orbit equivalent if and only if their full groups are isomorphic as abstract groups. This result is a topological version of the well-known Dye's theorem established originally for ergodic measure-preserving actions.
