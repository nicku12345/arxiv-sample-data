A geometric generalization of discrete-time linear deadbeat observer is presented. The proposed method to generate a deadbeat observer for a given nonlinear system is constructive and makes use of sets that can be computed iteratively. For demonstration, derivations of observer dynamics are provided for various example systems. Based on the method, a simple algorithm that computes the deadbeat gain for a linear system with scalar output is given.
