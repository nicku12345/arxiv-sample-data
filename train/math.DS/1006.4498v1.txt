We deal with Besicovitch's problem of existence of discrete orbits for transitive cylindrical transformations T_\varphi:(x,t)\mapsto(x+\alpha,t+\varphi(x)) where Tx=x+\alpha is an irrational rotation on the circle \T and \varphi:\T\to\R is continuous, i.e.\ we try to estimate how big can be the set D(\alpha,\varphi):=\{x\in\T:|\varphi^{(n)}(x)|\to+\infty\text{as}|n|\to+\infty\}. We show that for almost every \alpha there exists \varphi such that the Hausdorff dimension of D(\alpha,\varphi) is at least 1/2. We also provide a Diophantine condition on \alpha that guarantees the existence of \varphi such that the dimension of D(\alpha,\varphi) is positive. Finally, for some multidimensional rotations T on \T^d, d\geq3, we construct smooth \varphi so that the Hausdorff dimension of D(\alpha,\varphi) is positive.
