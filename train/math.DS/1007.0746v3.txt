Blanc showed in his thesis that a compact minimal foliated space with a residual subset of 2-ended leaves can contain only 1 or 2 ended leaves. In this paper we give examples of compact minimal foliated spaces where a topologically generic leaf has 1 end, there is an uncountable set of leaves with 2 ends and a leaf with 2n ends, for a given n>1. The examples we present are weak solenoids, which allows us to represent the graph of the group action on the fibre as the inverse limit of finite coverings of a finite graph, which we call the Schreier continuum, which we use to obtain the result. While in certain cases the problem can be reduced to the study of a self-similar action of an automorphism group of a regular tree, our geometric technique is more general, as it applies to cases where the action is not self-similar.
