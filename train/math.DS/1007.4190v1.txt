We consider the regularity of measurable solutions \chi to the cohomological equation \[   \phi = \chi \circ T -\chi, \] where (T,X,\mu) is a dynamical system and \phi \colon X\rightarrow \R is a C^k valued cocycle in the setting in which T \colon X\rightarrow X is a piecewise C^k Gibbs--Markov map, an affine \beta-transformation of the unit interval or more generally a piecewise C^{k} uniformly expanding map of an interval. We show that under mild assumptions, bounded solutions \chi possess C^k versions. In particular we show that if (T,X,\mu) is a \beta-transformation then \chi has a C^k version, thus improving a result of Pollicott et al.~\cite{Pollicott-Yuri}.
