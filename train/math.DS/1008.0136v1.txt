We study the recurrence and ergodicity for the billiard on noncompact polygonal surfaces with a free, cocompact action of \Z or \Z^2. In the \Z-periodic case, we establish criteria for recurrence. In the more difficult \Z^2-periodic case, we establish some general results. For a particular family of \Z^2-periodic polygonal surfaces, known in the physics literature as the wind-tree model, assuming certain restrictions of geometric nature, we obtain the ergodic decomposition of directional billiard dynamics for a dense, countable set of directions. This is a consequence of our results on the ergodicity of \ZZ-valued cocycles over irrational rotations.
