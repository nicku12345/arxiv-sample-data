The Kuramoto model is a system of ordinary differential equations for describing synchronization phenomena defined as a coupled phase oscillators. In this paper, a bifurcation structure of the infinite dimensional Kuramoto model is investigated. For a certain non-selfadjoint linear operator, which defines a linear part of the Kuramoto model, the spectral theory on a space of generalized functions is developed with the aid of a rigged Hilbert space to avoid a continuous spectrum on the imaginary axis. Although the linear operator has an unbounded continuous spectrum on a Hilbert space, it is shown that it admits a spectral decomposition consisting of a countable number of eigenfunctions on a space of generalized functions. The semigroup generated by the linear operator is calculated by using the spectral decomposition to prove the linear stability of a steady state of the system. The center manifold theory is also developed on a space of generalized functions. It is proved that there exists a finite dimensional center manifold on a space of generalized functions, while a center manifold on a Hilbert space is of infinite dimensional because of the continuous spectrum on the imaginary axis. The results are applied to the stability and bifurcation theory of the Kuramoto model to obtain a bifurcation diagram conjectured by Kuramoto. If the coupling strength K between oscillators is smaller than some threshold K_c, the de-synchronous state proves to be asymptotically stable, and if K exceeds K_c, a nontrivial solution, which corresponds to the synchronization, bifurcates from the de-synchronous state.
