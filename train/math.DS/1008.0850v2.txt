We study the set S of ergodic probability Borel measures on stationary non-simple Bratteli diagrams which are invariant with respect to the tail equivalence relation. Equivalently, the set S is formed by ergodic probability measures invariant with respect to aperiodic substitution dynamical systems. The paper is devoted to the classification of measures \mu from S with respect to a homeomorphism. The properties of these measures related to the clopen values set S(\mu) are studied. It is shown that for every measure \mu in S there exists a subgroup G of \mathbb R such that S(\mu) is the intersection of G with [0,1], i.e. S(\mu) is group-like. A criterion of goodness is proved for such measures. This result is used to classify the measures from S up to a homeomorphism. It is proved that for every good measure \mu in S there exist countably many measures \{\mu_i\}_{i\in \mathbb N} from S such that \mu and \mu_i are homeomorphic measures but the tail equivalence relations on corresponding Bratteli diagrams are not orbit equivalent.
