We establish the background for the study of geodesics on noncompact polygonal surfaces. For illustration, we study the recurrence of geodesics on Z-periodic polygonal surfaces. We prove, in particular, that almost all geodesics on a topologically typical Z-periodic surface with boundary are recurrent.
