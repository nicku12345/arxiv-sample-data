In this paper we study Holder continuous linear cocycles over transitive Anosov diffeomorphisms. Under various conditions of relative pinching we establish properties including existence and continuity of measurable invariant sub-bundles and conformal structures. We use these results to obtain criteria for cocycles to be isometric or conformal in terms of their periodic data. We show that if the return maps at the periodic points are, in a sense, conformal or isometric then so is the cocycle itself with respect to a Holder continuous Riemannian metric.
