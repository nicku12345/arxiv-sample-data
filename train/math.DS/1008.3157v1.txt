We introduce the study of the local dynamics around a parabolic indifferent invariant curve for fibred holomorphic maps. As in the classical non-fibred case, we show that petals are the main ingredient. Nevertheless, one expects the properties of the base rotation number should play an important role in the arrangement of the petals. We exhibit examples where the existence and the number of petals depend not just on the complex coordinate of the map, but on the base rotation number. Furthermore, under additional hypothesis on the arithmetics and smoothness of the map, we present a theorem that allows to characterize the local dynamics around a parabolic invariant curve.
