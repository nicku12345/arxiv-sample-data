For a nonlinear Anosov diffeomorphism of the 2-torus, we present examples of measures so that the group of \mu-preserving diffeomorphisms is, up to zero-entropy transformations, cyclic. For families of equilibrium states \mu, we strengthen this to show that the group of \mu-preserving diffeomorphism is virtually cyclic.
