A tuple (T_1,\dots,T_n) of continuous linear operators on a topological vector space X is called hypercyclic if there is x\in X such that the the orbit of x under the action of the semigroup generated by T_1,\dots,T_n is dense in X. This concept was introduced by N.~Feldman, who have raised 7 questions on hypercyclic tuples. We answer those 4 of them, which can be dealt with on the level of operators on finite dimensional spaces. In particular, we prove that the minimal cardinality of a hypercyclcic tuple of operators on C^n (respectively, on R^n) is n+1 (respectively, \frac n2+\frac{5+(-1)^n}{4}), that there are non-diagonalizable tuples of operators on R^2 which possess an orbit being neither dense nor nowhere dense and construct a hypercyclic 6-tuple of operators on C^3 such that every operator commuting with each member of the tuple is non-cyclic.
