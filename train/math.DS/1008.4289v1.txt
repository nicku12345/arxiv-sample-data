We introduce a family of dynamical systems that generate negative \beta-expansions and study the support of the invariant measure which is absolutely continuous with respect to Lebesgue measure. We give a characterization of the set of digit sequences that is produced by a typical member of this family of transformations. We discuss the meaning of greedy expansions in the negative sense, and show that there is no transformation in the introduced family of dynamical systems that generates negative greedy. However, if one looks at random algorithms, then it is possible to define a greedy expansion in base -\beta.
