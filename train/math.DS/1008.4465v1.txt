This paper defines the pressure for asymptotically subadditive potentials under a mistake function, including the measuretheoretical and the topological versions. Using the advanced techniques of ergodic theory and topological dynamics, we reveals a variational principle for the new defined topological pressure without any additional conditions on the potentials and the compact metric space.
