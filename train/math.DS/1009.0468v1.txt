The main result of this paper is to show that if \H is a normal subgroup of a Kleinian group G such that G/\H contains a coset which is represented by some loxodromic element, then the Hausdorff dimension of the transient limit set of \H coincides with the Hausdorff dimension of the limit set of G. This observation extends previous results by Fern\'andez and Meli\'an for Riemann surfaces.
