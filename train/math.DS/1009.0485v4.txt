We prove that for every \epsilon>0 there exists a minimal diffeomorphism f:\T^{2}\rightarrow\T^{2} of class C^{3-\epsilon} and semiconjugate to an ergodic traslation, and have the following properties: zero entropy, sensitivity with respect to initial conditions and Li-Yorke chaos. These examples are obtained through the holonomy of the unstable foliation of Ma\~{n}\'e's example of derived from Anosov diffeomorphism on \T^3.
