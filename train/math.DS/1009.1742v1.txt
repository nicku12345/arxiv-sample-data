In this paper, an original result in terms of a sufficient condition to test identifiability of nonlinear delayed-differential models with constant delays and multi-inputs is given. The identifiability is studied for the linearized system and a criterion for linear systems with constant delays is provided, from which the identifiability of the original nonlinear system can be proved. This result is obtained by combining a classical identifiability result for nonlinear ordinary differential systems due to M.S. Grewal and K. Glover (1976) with the identifiability of linear delayed-differential models developed by Y. Orlov et al. (2002). This paper is a generalization of the results provided by L. Denis-Vidal, C. Jauberthie, G. Joly-Blanchard (2006), which deal with the specific case of nonlinear delayed-differential models with two delays and a single input.
