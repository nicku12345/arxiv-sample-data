The article addresses some open questions about the relations between the topological weak mixing property and the transitivity of the map f\times f^2 \times...\times f^m, where f\colon X\ra X is a topological dynamical system on a compact metric space. The theorem stating that a weakly mixing and strongly transitive system is \Delta-transitive is extended to a non-invertible case with a simple proof. Two examples are constructed, answering the questions posed by Moothathu [Colloq. Math. 120 (2010), no. 1, 127--138]. The first one is a multi-transitive non weakly mixing system, and the second one is a weakly mixing non multi-transitive system. The examples are special spacing shifts. The later shows that the assumption of minimality in the Multiple Recurrence Theorem can not be replaced by weak mixing.
