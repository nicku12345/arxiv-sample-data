In the general case of the \mathfrak{so}(n) free rigid body we give a list of integrals of motion, which generate the set of Mishchenko's integrals. In the case of \mathfrak{so}(5) we prove that there are fifteen coordinate type Cartan subalgebras which on a regular adjoint orbit give fifteen Weyl group orbits of equilibria. These coordinate type Cartan subalgebras are the analogues of the three axes of equilibria for the classical rigid body on \mathfrak{so}(3). The nonlinear stability and instability of these equilibria is analyzed. In addition to these equilibria there are ten other continuous families of equilibria.
