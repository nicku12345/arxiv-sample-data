We prove a geometric criterion on a \SL-invariant ergodic probability measure on the moduli space of holomorphic abelian differentials on Riemann surfaces for the non-uniform hyperbolicity of the Kontsevich--Zorich cocycle on the real Hodge bundle. Applications include measures supported on the \SL-orbits of all algebraically primitive Veech surfaces (see also \cite{Bouw:Moeller}) and of all Prym eigenforms discovered in \cite{McMullen2}, as well as all canonical absolutely continuous measures on connected components of strata of the moduli space of abelian differentials (see also \cite{Ftwo}, \cite{Avila:Viana}). The argument simplifies and generalizes our proof for the case of canonical measures \cite{Ftwo}. In an Appendix Carlos Matheus discusses several relevant examples which further illustrate the power and the limitations of our criterion.
