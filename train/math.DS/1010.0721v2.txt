We show that diffeomorphisms with a dominated splitting of the form E^s\oplus E^c\oplus E^u, where E^c is a nonhyperbolic central bundle that splits in a dominated way into 1-dimensional subbundles, are entropy-expansive. In particular, they have a principal symbolic extension and equilibrium states.
