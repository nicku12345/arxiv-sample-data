We prove that if G\subset\text{Diff}^{1}(\mathbb{R}^2) is an Abelian subgroup generated by a family of commuting diffeomorphisms of the plane, all of which are C^{1}-close to the identity in the strong C^{1}-topology, and if there exist a point p\in\mathbb{R}^2 whose orbit is bounded under the action of G, then the elements of G have a common fixed point in the convex hull of \bar{\mathcal{O}_{p}(G)}. Here, \bar{\mathcal{O}_{p}(G)} denotes the topological closure of the orbit of p by G.
