Let BS(1, n)=< a, b | aba^{-1} = b^n > be the solvable Baumslag-Solitar group, where  n\geq 2. It is known that B(1, n) is isomorphic to the group generated by the two affine maps of the line : f_0(x) = x + 1 and h_0(x) = nx . The action on S^1 = \RR \cup {\infty} generated by these two affine maps f_0 and h_0  is called the standard affine one. We prove that any representation of BS(1,n) into Diff^1(S^1) is (up to a finite index subgroup) semiconjugated to the standard affine action.
