We examine thermodynamic formalism for a class of renormalizable dynamical systems which in the symbolic space is generated by the Thue-Morse substitution, and in complex dynamics by the Feigenbaum-Coullet-Tresser map. The basic question answered is whether fixed points V of a renormalization operator \CR acting on the space of potentials are such that the pressure function \gamma \mapsto \CP(-\gamma V) exhibits phase transitions. This extends the work by Baraviera, Leplaideur and Lopes on the Manneville-Pomeau map, where such phase transitions were indeed detected. In this paper, however, the attractor of renormalization is a Cantor set (rather than a single fixed point), which admits various classes of fixed points of \CR, some of which do and some of which do not exhibit phase transitions. In particular, we show it is possible to reach, as a ground state, a quasi-crystal before temperature zero by freezing a dynamical system.
