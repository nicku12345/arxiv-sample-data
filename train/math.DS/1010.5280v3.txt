We give a combinatorial classification for the class of postcritically fixed Newton maps of polynomials as dynamical systems. This lays the foundation for classification results of more general classes of Newton maps.   A fundamental ingredient is the proof that for every Newton map (postcritically finite or not) every connected component of the basin of an attracting fixed point can be connected to \infty through a finite chain of such components.
