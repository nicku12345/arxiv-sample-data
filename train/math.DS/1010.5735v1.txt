We discuss properties of orbits of (semi)group actions on locally compact groups G. In particular, we show that if a compactly generated locally compact abelian group acts distally on G then the closure of each of its orbits is a minimal closed invariant set (i.e. the action has [MOC]). We also show that for such an action distality is preserved if we go modulo any closed normal invariant subgroup and hence [MOC] is also preserved. We also show that any semigroup action on G has [MOC] if and only if the corresponding actions on a compact invariant metrizable subgroup K and on the quotient space G/K has [MOC].
