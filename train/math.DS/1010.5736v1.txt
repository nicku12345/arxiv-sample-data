We consider a class of foliations on the complex projective plane that are determined by a quadratic vector field in a fixed affine neighborhood. Such foliations, as a rule, have an invariant line at infinity. Two foliations with singularities on \mathbb C P^2 are topologically equivalent provided that there exists a homeomorphism of the projective plane onto itself that preserves orientation both on the leaves and in \mathbb C P^2 and brings the leaves of the first foliation to that of the second one. We prove that a generic foliation of this class may be topologically equivalent to but a finite number of foliations of the same class, modulo affine equivalence. This property is called \emph{total rigidity}. Recent result of Lins Neto implies that the finite number above does not exceed 240. This is the first of the two closely related papers. It deals with the rigidity properties of quadratic foliations, whilst the second one studies the foliations of higher degree.
