Dynamical systems that describe the escape from the basins of attraction of stable invariant sets are presented and analyzed. It is shown that the stable fixed points of such dynamical systems are the index-1 saddle points. Generalizations to high index saddle points are discussed. Both gradient and non-gradient systems are considered. Preliminary results on the nature of the dynamical behavior are presented.
