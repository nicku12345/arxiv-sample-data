Given an ergodic flow T=(T_t)_{t\in\Bbb R}, let I(T) be the set of reals s\ne 0 for which the flows (T_{st})_{t\in\Bbb R} and T are isomorphic. It is proved that I(T) is a Borel subset of \Bbb R^*. It carries a natural Polish group topology which is stronger than the topology induced from \Bbb R. There exists a mixing flow T such that I(T) is an uncountable meager subset of \Bbb R^*. For a generic flow T, the transformations T_{t_1} and T_{t_2} are spectrally disjoint whenever |t_1|\ne |t_2|. A generic transformation (i) embeds into a flow T with I(T)=\{1\} and (ii) does not embed into a flow with I(T)\ne \{1\}. For each countable multiplicative subgroup S\subset\Bbb R^*, it is constructed a Poisson suspension flow T with simple spectrum such that I(T)=S. If S is without rational relations then there is a rank-one weakly mixing rigid flow T with I(T)=S.
