We study the symmetries and geodesics of an infinite translation surface which arises as a limit of translation surfaces built from regular polygons, studied by Veech. We find the affine symmetry group of this infinite translation surface, and we show that this surface admits a deformation into other surfaces with topologically equivalent affine symmetries. The geodesics on these new surfaces are combinatorially the same as the geodesics on the original.
