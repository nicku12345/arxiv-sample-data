We consider a rational system of first order difference equations in the plane with four parameters such that all fractions have a common denominator. We study, for the different values of the parameters, the global and local properties of the system. In particular, we discuss the boundedness and the asymptotic behavior of the solutions, the existence of periodic solutions and the stability of equilibria.
