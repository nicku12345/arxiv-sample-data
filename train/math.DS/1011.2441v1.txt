We prove that a C^1-generic symplectic diffeomorphism is either Anosov or the topological entropy is bounded from below by the supremum over the smallest positive Lyapunov exponent of the periodic points. We also prove that C^1-generic symplectic diffeomorphisms outside the Anosov ones do not admit symbolic extension and finally we give examples of volume preserving diffeomorphisms which are not point of upper semicontinuity of entropy function in C^1-topology.
