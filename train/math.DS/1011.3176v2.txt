Let f be a homeomorphism of the closed annulus A isotopic to the identity, and let X\subset {\rm Int}A be an f-invariant continuum which separates A into two domains, the upper domain U_+ and the lower domain U_-. Fixing a lift of f to the universal cover of A, one defines the rotation set \tilde \rho(X) of X by means of the invariant probabilities on X. For any rational number p/q\in \tilde\rho(X), f is shown to admit a p/q periodic point in X, provided that (1) X consists of nonwandering points or (2) X is an attractor and the frontiers of U_- and U_+ coincides with X. Also the Carath\'eodory rotation numbers of U_\pm are shown to be in \tilde\rho(X) for any separating invariant continuum X.
