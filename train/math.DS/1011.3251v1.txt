In the history of mechanics, there have been two points of view for studying mechanical systems: Newtonian and Cartesian.   According the Descartes point of view, the motion of mechanical systems is described by the first-order differential equations in the N dimensional configuration space .   In this paper we develop the Cartesian approach for mechanical systems with constraints which are linear with respect to velocity.
