In this part we study the dynamics of the following rational multi-parameter first order difference equation x_{n+1} =(ax_{n}^3+ bx_{n}^2+cx_{n} + d)/x_{n}^3, x_{0}\in R^{+} where the parameters a, b, d together with the initial condition x_{0} are positive while the parameter c could accept some negative values. We investigate the equilibria and 2-cycles of this equation and analyze qualitative and asymptotic behavior of it's solutions such as convergence to an equilibrium or to a 2-cycle.
