We consider the family of transcendental entire maps given by f_a(z)=a(z-(1-a))\exp(z+a) where a is a complex parameter. Every map has a superattracting fixed point at z=-a and an asymptotic value at z=0. For a>1 the Julia set of f_a is known to be homeomorphic to the Sierpi\'nski universal curve, thus containing embedded copies of any one-dimensional plane continuum. In this paper we study subcontinua of the Julia set that can be defined in a combinatorial manner. In particular, we show the existence of non-landing hairs with prescribed combinatorics embedded in the Julia set for all parameters a\geq 3. We also study the relation between non-landing hairs and the immediate basin of attraction of z=-a. Even as each non-landing hair accumulates onto the boundary of the immediate basin at a single point, its closure, nonetheless, becomes an indecomposable subcontinuum of the Julia set.
