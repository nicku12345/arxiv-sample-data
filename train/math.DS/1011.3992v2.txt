In the spirit of Goodman-Plante average condition for the existence of a transverse invariant measure for foliations, we give an averaging condition to find tangentially smooth measures with prescribed Radon-Nikodym cocycle. Harmonic measures are examples of tangentially smooth measures for foliations and laminations. We also present sufficient hypothesis on the averaging condition under which the tangentially smooth measure is harmonic.
