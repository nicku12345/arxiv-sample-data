In this paper we study the existence of periodic orbits in the flow of non-singular steady Euler fields X on closed 3-manifolds, that is X is a solution of time independent Euler equations. We show, that when X is C^2 the flow always posses a periodic orbit unless the manifold is a torus bundle over the circle. This result generalizes preavious result of J. Etnyre and R. Ghrist by weakening the real analytic hypothesis to C^2.
