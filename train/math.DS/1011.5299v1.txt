In this paper, we study two properties of the Lyapunov exponents under small perturbations: one is when we can remove zero Lyapunov exponents and the other is when we can distinguish all the Lyapunov exponents. The first result shows that we can perturb all the zero integrated Lyapunov exponents \int_M \lambda_j(x)d\omega(x) into nonzero ones, for any partially hyperbolic diffeomorphism. The second part contains an example which shows the local genericity of diffeomorphisms with non-simple spectrum and three results: one discusses the relation between simple-spectrum property and the existence of complex eigenvalues; the other two describe the difference on the spectrum between the diffeomorphisms far from homoclinic tangencies and those in the interior of the complement. Moreover, among the conservative diffeomorphisms far from tangencies, we prove that ergodic ones form a residual subset.
