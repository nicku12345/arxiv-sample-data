For an ergodic hyperbolic measure \omega of a C^{1+{\alpha}} diffeomorphism, there is an \omega full-measured set \tilde\Lambda such that every nonempty, compact and connected subset V of \mathbb{M}_{inv}(\tilde\Lambda) coincides with the accumulating set of time averages of Dirac measures supported at {\it one orbit}, where \mathbb{M}_{inv}(\tilde\Lambda) denotes the space of invariant measures supported on \tilde\Lambda. Such state points corresponding to a fixed V are dense in the support supp(\omega). Moreover, \mathbb{M}_{inv}(\tilde\Lambda) can be accumulated by time averages of Dirac measures supported at {\it one orbit}, and such state points form a residual subset of supp(\omega). These extend results of Sigmund [9] from uniformly hyperbolic case to non-uniformly hyperbolic case. As a corollary, irregular points form a residual set of supp(\omega).
