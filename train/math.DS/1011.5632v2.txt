We consider discontinuous dynamics of integrate-and-fire models, which consist of pulse-coupled biological oscillators. A thoroughly constructed map is in the basis of the analysis. Synchronization of non-identical oscillators is investigated. Significant advances for the solution of second Peskin's conjecture have been made. Examples with numerical simulations are given to validate the theoretical results. Perspectives are discussed.
