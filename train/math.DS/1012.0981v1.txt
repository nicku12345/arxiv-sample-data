Let f be a homeomorphism of the closed annulus A isotopic to the identity, and let X\subset {\rm Int}A be an f-invariant continuum which separates A into two domains, the upper domain U_+ and the lower domain U_-. Fixing a lift of f to the universal cover of A, one defines the rotation set \tilde \rho(X) of X by means of the invariant probabilities on X, as well as the prime end rotation number \check\rho_\pm of U_\pm. The purpose of this paper is to show that \check\rho_\pm belongs to \tilde\rho(X) for any separating invariant continuum X.
