The problem of genealogy of permutations has been solved partially by Stefan (odd order) and Acosta-Hum\'anez & Bernhardt (power of two). It is well known that Sharkovskii's theorem shows the relationship between the cardinal of the set of periodic points of a continuous map, but simple permutations will show the behavior of those periodic points. This paper studies the structure of permutations of mixed order 4n+2, its properties and a way to describe its genealogy by using Pasting and Reversing.
