We study the dimension spectrum for Lyapunov exponents for rational maps acting on the Riemann sphere and characterize it by means of the Legendre-Fenchel transform of the hidden variational pressure. This pressure is defined by means of the variational principle with respect to non-atomic invariant probability measures and is associated to certain \sigma-finite conformal measures. This allows to extend previous results to exceptional rational maps.
