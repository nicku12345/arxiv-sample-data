This paper studies non-autonomous Lyness type recurrences of the form x_{n+2}=(a_n+x_{n+1})/x_{n}, where \{a_n\} is a k-periodic sequence of positive numbers with primitive period k. We show that for the cases k\in\{1,2,3,6\} the behavior of the sequence \{x_n\} is simple (integrable) while for the remaining cases satisfying this behavior can be much more complicated (chaotic). We also show that the cases where k is a multiple of 5 present some different features.
