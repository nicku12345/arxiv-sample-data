Consider the vector field x'= -yG(x, y), y'=xG(x, y), where the set of critical points \{G(x, y) = 0\} is formed by K straight lines, not passing through the origin and parallel to one or two orthogonal directions. We perturb it with a general polynomial perturbation of degree n and study which is the maximum number of limit cycles that can bifurcate from the period annulus of the origin in terms of K and n. Our approach is based on the explicit computation of the Abelian integral that controls the bifurcation and in a new result for bounding the number of zeroes of a certain family of real functions. When we apply our results for K\le4 we recover or improve some results obtained in several previous works.
