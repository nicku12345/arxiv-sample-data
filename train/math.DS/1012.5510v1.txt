In this paper, we discuss the relationship between Li-Yorke chaos and distributional chaos in a sequence. We point out the set of all distributional \delta-scramble pairs in the sequence Q is a G_\delta set, and prove that Li-Yorke \delta-chaos is equivalent to distributional \delta-chaos in a sequence, a uniformly chaotic set is a distributional scramble set in some sequence and a class of transitive system implies distributional chaos in a sequence.
