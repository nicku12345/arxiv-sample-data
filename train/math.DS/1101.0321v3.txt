Berend gives necessary and sufficient conditions on a Z^r-action \alpha on a torus T^d by toral automorphisms in order for every orbit be either finite or dense. One of these conditions is that on every common eigendirection of the Z^r-action there is an element \mathbf n \in Z^r so that \alpha^\mathbf n expands this direction. In this paper, we investigate what happens when this condition is removed; more generally, we consider a partial orbit \{\alpha^\mathbf n.x : \mathbf n \in \Omega\} where \Omega is a set of elements which acts approximately as the identity on a given set of eigendirections. This analysis is used in an essential way in the work of the author with E. Lindenstrauss classifying topological self-joinings of maximal Z^r-actions on tori for r\geq 3.
