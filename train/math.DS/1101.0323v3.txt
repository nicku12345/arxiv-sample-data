We show that if r\geq 3 and \alpha is a faithful Z^r-Cartan action on a torus T^d by automorphisms, then any closed subset of (T^d)^2 which is invariant and topologically transitive under the diagonal \bZ^r-action by \alpha is homogeneous, in the sense that it is either the full torus (T^d)^2, or a finite set of rational points, or a finite disjoint union of parallel translates of some d-dimensional invariant subtorus. A counterexample is constructed for the rank 2 case.
