Let \Sigma and \bar\Sigma be finite alphabets. For topologically transitive sofic systems  X\subset \Sigma^{\Bbb Z} and \widetilde X\subset \widetilde\Sigma^{\Bbb Z} we give a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a homomorphism from X to \widetilde X. For topologically mixing sofic systems X \subset \Sigma^{\Bbb Z} and \widetilde X\subset \widetilde\Sigma^{\Bbb Z}, such that the topological entropy of \widetilde X is less than the topological entropy of X, we give a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a homomorphism of X onto \widetilde X.
