The Frobenius number F(\ba) of a lattice point \ba in \R^d with positive coprime coordinates, is the largest integer which can not be expressed as a non-negative integer linear combination of the coordinates of \ba. Marklof in \cite{M} proved the existence of the limit distribution of the Frobenius numbers, when \ba is taken to be random in an enlarging domain in \R^d. We will show that if the domain has piecewise smooth boundary, the error term for the convergence of the distribution functions is at most a polynomial in the enlarging factor.
