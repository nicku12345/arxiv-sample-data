We study skew-maps given by a minimal homeomorphism on the basis and a cocycle of affine isometries on the fibers. We call such a map a cylindrical vortex. We extend to this setting some classical results of Atkinson, Besicovitch, Matsumoto-Shishikura and Schinelman (among other people) about cylindrical cascades. In particular, we show that no cylindrical vortex is minimal, and we construct interesting examples of topologically transitive ones.
