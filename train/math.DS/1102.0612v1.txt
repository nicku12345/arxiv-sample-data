We describe dimensional entropies introduced in a previous work list some of their properties and give some new proofs. These entropies allowed the definition of entropy-expanding maps. We introduce a new notion of entropy-hyperbolicity for diffeomorphisms. We indicate some simple sufficient conditions (some of them new) for these properties. We conclude by some work in progress and more questions.
