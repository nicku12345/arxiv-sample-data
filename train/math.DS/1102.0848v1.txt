We study the problem of lifting various mixing properties from a base automorphism T\in {\rm Aut}\xbm to skew products of the form \tfs, where \va:X\to G is a cocycle with values in a locally compact Abelian group G, \cs=(S_g)_{g\in G} is a measurable representation of G in {\rm Aut}\ycn and \tfs acts on the product space   (X\times Y,\cb\ot\cc,\mu\ot\nu) by \tfs(x,y)=(Tx,S_{\va(x)}(y)). It is also shown that whenever T is ergodic (mildly mixing, mixing) but \tfs is not ergodic (is not mildly mixing, not mixing), then on a non-trivial factor \ca\subset\cc of \cs the corresponding Rokhlin cocycle x\mapsto S_{\va(x)}|_{\ca} is a coboundary (a quasi-coboundary).
