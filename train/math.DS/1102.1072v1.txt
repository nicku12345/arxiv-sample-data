We study the set M_\infty(X) of all infinite full non-atomic Borel measures on a Cantor space X. For a measure \mu from M_\infty(X) we define a defective set M_\mu = \{x \in X : for any clopen set U which contains x we have \mu(U) = \infty \}. We call a measure \mu from M_\infty(X) non-defective (\mu \in M_\infty^0(X)) if \mu(M_\mu) = 0. The paper is devoted to the classification of measures \mu from M_\infty^0(X) with respect to a homeomorphism. The notions of goodness and clopen values set S(\mu) are defined for a non-defective measure \mu. We give a criterion when two good non-defective measures are homeomorphic and prove that there exist continuum classes of weakly homeomorphic good non-defective measures on a Cantor space. For any group-like subset D \subset [0,\infty) we find a good non-defective measure \mu on a Cantor space X with S(\mu) = D and an aperiodic homeomorphism of X which preserves \mu. The set S of infinite ergodic R-invariant measures on non-simple stationary Bratteli diagrams consists of non-defective measures. For \mu \in S the set S(\mu) is group-like, a criterion of goodness is proved for such measures. We show that a homeomorphism class of a good measure from S contains countably many distinct good measures from S.
