We give sufficient conditions for the rigid body in the presence of an axisymmetric force field and a gyroscopic torque to admit a Hamilton-Poisson formulation. Even if by adding a gyroscopic torque we initially lose one of the conserved Casimirs, we recover another conservation law as a Casimir function for a modified Poisson structure. We apply this frame to several well known results in the literature.
