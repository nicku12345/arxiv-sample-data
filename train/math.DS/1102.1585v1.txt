Some Caputo q-fractional difference equations are solved. The solutions are expressed by means of a new introduced generalized type of q-Mittag-Leffler functions. The method of successive approximation is used to obtain the solutions. The obtained q-version of Mittag-Leffler function is thought as the q-analogue of the one introduced previously by Kilbas and Saigo.
