By varying a parameter of a one-dimensional piecewise smooth map, stable periodic orbits are observed. In this paper, complete analytic characterization of these stable periodic orbits is obtained. An interesting relationship between the cardinality of orbits and their period is established. It is proved that for any n, there exist \phi(n) distinct admissible patterns of cardinality n. An algorithm to obtain these distinct admissible patterns is outlined. Additionally, a novel algorithm to find the range of parameter for which the orbit exists is proposed.
