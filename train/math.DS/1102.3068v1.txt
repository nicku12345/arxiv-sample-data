We study the behavior of maximal multiplicities mm (R^n) for the powers of a weakly mixing automorphism R. For some special infinite set A we show the existence of a weakly mixing rank-one automorphism R such that mm (R^n)=n and mm(R^{n+1}) =1 for all n\in A. Moreover, the cardinality cardm(R^n) of the set of spectral multiplicities for R^n is not bounded. We have cardm(R^{n+1})=1 and cardm(R^n)=2^{m(n)}, m(n)\to\infty, n\in A. We also construct another weakly mixing automorphism R with the following properties: mm(R^{n}) =n for n=1,2,3,..., 2009, 2010 but mm(T^{2011}) =1, all powers (R^{n}) have homogeneous spectrum, and the set of limit points of the sequence \{\frac{mm (R^n)}{n} : n\in \N \} is infinite.
