We consider subsets of the (symbolic) sequence space that are invariant under the action of the semigroup of multiplicative integers. A representative example is the collection of all 0-1 sequences (x_k) such that x_k x_{2k}=0 for all k. We compute the Hausdorff and Minkowski dimensions of these sets and show that they are typically different. The proof proceeds via a variational principle for multiplicative subshifts.
