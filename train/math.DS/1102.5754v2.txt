Three topics in dynamical systems are discussed. In the first two sections we solve some open problems concerning, respectively, Furstenberg entropy of stationary dynamical systems, and uniformly rigid actions admitting a weakly mixing fully supported invariant probability measure. In the third section we provide a new example that displays some unexpected properties of strictly ergodic actions of non-amenable groups.
