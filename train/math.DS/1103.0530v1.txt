In this technical report the C_0 semigroup of Frobenius-Perron operators on L^1(X) is considered, where the underlying dynamical system is such that trajectories may leave the state space X and terminate. We introduce a discrete infinitesimal generator and show, that the operator semigroup generated by this discrete generator converges in L^1(X) pointwise to the Frobenius-Perron operator of the system.
