We introduce two square-tiled surfaces, one with 8 squares inside \Omega \mathcal{M}_3(2,2), and the other with 9 squares inside \Omega \mathcal{M}_4(3,3), respectively. In these examples, the dimensions of the isotropic subspaces (in absolute homology) generated by the waist curves of the maximal cylinders in any fixed rational direction are 2 and 3 respectively. Hence, a geometrical criterion of G. Forni for the non-uniform hyperbolicity of Kontsevich-Zorich (KZ) cocycle can not be applied to these examples. Nevertheless, we prove that there are no vanishing exponents and the spectrum is simple for these two square-tiled surfaces. In particular, the non-vanishing of exponents of KZ cocycle for a regular measure doesn't imply that the support of this measure contains a completely periodic surface whose waist curves of maximal cylinders generates a Lagrangian subspace in its absolute homology.
