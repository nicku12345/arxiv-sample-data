Let the adiabatic invariant of action variable in slow-fast Hamiltonian system with two degrees of freedom have two limiting values along the trajectories as time tends to infinity. The difference of two limits is exponentially small in analytic systems. An iso-energetic reduction and canonical transformations are applied to transform the slow-fast systems to form of systems depending on slowly varying parameters in a complexified phase space. On the basis of this method an estimate for the accuracy of conservation of adiabatic invariant is given for such systems.
