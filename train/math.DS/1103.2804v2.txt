Studying the dynamics of attracting rigid germs f:(\mathbb{C}^d, 0) \rightarrow (\mathbb{C}^d, 0) in dimension d \geq 3, a new phenomenon arise: principal resonances. The resonances of the classic Poincar\'e-Dulac theory are given by (multiplicative) relations between the eigenvalues of df_0; principal resonances arise as (multiplicative) relations between the non-null eigenvalues of df_0, and the "leading term" for the superattracting part of f. We shall prove that for attracting rigid germs there are only finitely-many principal resonances, and a Poincar\'e-Dulac renormalization theorem in this case. We shall conclude with some considerations on the classification of a special class of attracting rigid germs in any dimension, and we specialize the result to the 3-dimensional case.
