In this note we show that the regular part of the natural extension (in the sense of Lyubich and Minsky) of quadratic map f(z) = e^{2 \pi i \theta}z + z^2 with irrational \theta of bounded type has only parabolic leaves except the invariant lift of the Siegel disk.   We also show that though the natural extension of a rational function with a Cremer fixed point has a continuum of irregular points, it can not supply enough singularity to apply the Gross star theorem to find hyperbolic leaves.
