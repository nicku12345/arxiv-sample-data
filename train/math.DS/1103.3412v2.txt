Let (X,T) be a topological dynamical system and \mathcal{F} be a Furstenberg family (a collection of subsets of \mathbb{Z}_+ with hereditary upward property). A point x\in X is called an \mathcal{F}-transitive one if \{n\in\mathbb{Z}_+:\, T^n x\in U\}\in\F for every nonempty open subset U of X; the system (X,T) is called \F-point transitive if there exists some \mathcal{F}-transitive point. In this paper, we aim to classify transitive systems by \mathcal{F}-point transitivity. Among other things, it is shown that (X,T) is a weakly mixing E-system (resp.\@ weakly mixing M-system, HY-system) if and only if it is \{\textrm{D-sets}\}-point transitive (resp.\@ \{\textrm{central sets}\}-point transitive, \{\textrm{weakly thick sets}\}-point transitive).   It is shown that every weakly mixing system is \mathcal{F}_{ip}-point transitive, while we construct an \mathcal{F}_{ip}-point transitive system which is not weakly mixing. As applications, we show that every transitive system with dense small periodic sets is disjoint from every totally minimal system and a system is \Delta^*(\mathcal{F}_{wt})-transitive if and only if it is weakly disjoint from every P-system.
