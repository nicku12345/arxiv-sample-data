We generalize recent developments on normal forms and the spectral sequences method to make a foundation for parametric normal forms. We further introduce a new style and costyle to obtain unique parametric normal forms. The results are applied to systems of generalized Hopf singularity with multiple parameters. A different (new) version of this paper has been submitted for a possible publication in a refereed journal.
