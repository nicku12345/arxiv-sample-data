First approach of invariant densities of a Perron Frobenius operator. Asymptotic behaviours of ODE or PDE, as, are most interesting. The associed infinitesimal iteration is. If is partially linear, a random distribution can be asymptotic solution. Among applications, are asymptotic profiles of of Lorenz, Navier Stokes or Hamilton's \'equations.
