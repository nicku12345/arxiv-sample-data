This paper presents results concerning bifurcations of 2D piecewise-smooth dynamical systems governed by vector fields. Generic three-parameter families of a class of Non-Smooth Vector Fields are studied and the bifurcation diagrams are exhibited. Our main results describe the unfolding of the so called Resonant Fold-Saddle singularity.
