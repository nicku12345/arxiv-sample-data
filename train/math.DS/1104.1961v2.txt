Given a transformation T of a standard measure space (X,\mu), let \Cal M(T) denote the set of spectral multiplicities of the Koopman operator U_T defined in L^2(X,\mu)\ominus\Bbb C by U_Tf:=f\circ T. It is discussed in this survey paper which subsets of \Bbb N\cup\{\infty\} are realizable as \Cal M(T) for various T: ergodic, weakly mixing, mixing, Gaussian, Poisson, ergodic infinite measure preserving, etc. The corresponding constructions are considered in detail. Generalizations to actions of Abelian locally compact second countable groups are also discussed.
