The two-dimensional homogeneous Euclidean algorithm is the central motivation for the definition of the classical multidimensional continued fraction algorithms, as Jacobi-Perron, Poincar\'e, Brun and Selmer algorithms. The Rauzy induction, a generalization of the Euclidean algorithm, is a key tool in the study of interval exchange transformations. Both maps are known to be dissipative and ergodic with respect to Lebesgue measure. Here we prove that they are exact.
