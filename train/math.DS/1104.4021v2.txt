It is known that the Principal Poincar\'e Pontryagin Function is generically an Abelian integral. In non generic cases it is an iterated integral.   In previous papers one of the authors gives a precise description of the Principal Poincar\'e Pontryagin Function, an iterated integral af length at most 2, involving a logarithmic function with only one ramification at a point at infinity.   We show here that this property can be generalized to Hamiltonians having real points at infinity and satisfying some properties.
