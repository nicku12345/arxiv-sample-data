Let f be a volume-preserving diffeomorphism of a closed C1 n-dimensional Riemannian manifold M: In this paper, we prove the equivalence between the following conditions: (a) f belongs to the C1-interior of the set of volume-preserving diffeomorphisms which satisfy the weak shadowing property, (b) f belongs to the C1-interior of the set of volume-preserving diffeomorphisms which satisfy the limit weak shadowing property, (c) f is Anosov.
