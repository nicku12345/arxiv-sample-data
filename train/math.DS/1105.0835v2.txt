We show that any codimension one hyperbolic attractor of a diffeomorphism of a (d+1)-dimensional closed manifold is shape equivalent to a (d+1)-dimensional torus with a finite number of points removed, or, in the non-orientable case, to a space with a 2 to 1 covering by such a torus-less-points. Furthermore, we show that each orientable attractor is homeomorphic to a tiling space associated to an aperiodic tiling of Rd, but that the converse is generally not true. This work allows the definition of a new invariant for aperiodic tilings, in many cases finer than the cohomological or K-theoretic invariants studied to date.
