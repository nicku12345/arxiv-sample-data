We develop two notions of time-restricted sensitivity to initial conditions for measurable dynamical systems, where the time before divergence of a pair of paths is at most an asymptotically logarithmic function of a measure of their initial distance. In the context of finite measure-preserving transformations on a compact space, we relate these notions to the metric entropy of the system. We examine one of these notions for classes of non-measure-preserving, nonsingular transformations.
