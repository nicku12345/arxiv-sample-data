We show, when G is a nilpotent or reductive Lie group, that the entropy of any surjective endomorphism coincides with the entropy of its restriction to the toral component of the center of G. In particular, if G is a semi-simple Lie group, the entropy of any surjective endomorphism always vanishes. Since every compact group is reductive, the formula for the entropy of a endomorphism of a compact group reduces to the formula for the entropy of an endomorphism of a torus.
