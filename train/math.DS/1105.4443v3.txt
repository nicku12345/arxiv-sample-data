We study the group of C^{r}-diffeomorphisms of the closed annulus that are isotopic to the identity. We show that, for r different from 3, the linear space of homogeneous quasi-morphisms on this group is one dimensional. Therefore, the commutator length on this group is (stably) unbounded. In particular, this provides an example of a manifold whose diffeomorphisms group is unbounded in the sense of Burago, Ivanov and Polterovich.
