We define "slow" entropy invariants for Z^2 actions on infinite measure spaces, which measures growth of itineraries at subexponential scales. We use this to construct infinite-measure preserving Z^2 actions which cannot be realized as a group of diffeomorphisms of a compact manifold preserving a Borel measure, contrary to the situation for Z-actions, where every infinite-measure preserving action can be realized in this way.
