Semi-invertible multiplicative ergodic theorems establish the existence of an Oseledets splitting for cocycles of non-invertible linear operators (such as transfer operators) over an invertible base. Using a constructive approach, we establish a semi-invertible multiplicative ergodic theorem that for the first time can be applied to the study of transfer operators associated to the composition of piecewise expanding interval maps randomly chosen from a set of cardinality of the continuum.
