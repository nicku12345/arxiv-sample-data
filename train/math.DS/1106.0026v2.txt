For a normal subgroup N of the free group \F_d with at least two generators we introduce the radial limit set \Lr(N,\Phi) of N with respect to a graph directed Markov system \Phi associated to \F_d. These sets are shown to provide fractal models of radial limit sets of normal subgroups of Kleinian groups of Schottky type. Our main result states that if \Phi is symmetric and linear, then we have that \dim_{H}(\Lr(N,\Phi))=\dim_{H} \Lr(\F_d,\Phi)) if and only if the quotient group \F_d /N is amenable, where \dim_{H} denotes the Hausdorff dimension. This extends a result of Brooks for normal subgroups of Kleinian groups to a large class of fractal sets. Moreover, we show that if \F_d /N is non-amenable then \dim_{H}(\Lr(N,\Phi))>\dim_{H}(\Lr(\F_d,\Phi))/2, which extends results by Falk and Stratmann and by Roblin.
