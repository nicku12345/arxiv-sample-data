We investigate some properties of (universal) Banach spaces of real functions in the context of topological entropy. Among other things, we show that any subspace of C([0,1]) which is isometrically isomorphic to \ell_1 contains a functions with infinite topological entropy. Also, for any t \in [0, \infty], we construct a (one-dimensional) Banach space in which any nonzero function has topological entropy equal to t.
