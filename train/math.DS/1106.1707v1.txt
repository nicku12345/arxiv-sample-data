For a certain parametrized family of maps on the circle with critical points and logarithmic singularities where derivatives blow up to infinity, we construct a positive measure set of parameters corresponding to maps which exhibit nonuniformly expanding behavior. This implies the existence of "chaotic" dynamics in dissipative homoclinic tangles in periodically perturbed differential equations.
