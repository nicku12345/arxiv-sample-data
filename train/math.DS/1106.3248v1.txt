Let (X, \cal B, \nu) be a probability space and let \Gamma be a countable group of \nu-preserving invertible maps of X into itself. To a probability measure \mu on \Gamma corresponds a random walk on X with Markov operator P given by P\psi(x) = \sum_{a} \psi(ax) \, \mu(a). A powerful tool is the spectral gap property for the operator P when it holds. We consider various examples of ergodic \Gamma-actions and random walks and their extensions by a vector space: groups of automorphisms or affine transformations on compact nilmanifolds, random walk in random scenery on non amenable groups, translations on homogeneous spaces of simple Lie groups, random walks on motion groups. The spectral gap property is applied to obtain limit theorems, recurrence/transience property and ergodicity for random walks on non compact extensions of the corresponding dynamical systems.
