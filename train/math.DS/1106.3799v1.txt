In this note, we consider locally invertible analytic mappings in two dimensions, with coefficients in a non-archimedean field. Suppose such a map has a Jacobian with eigenvalues \lambda_1 and \lambda_2 so that |\lambda_1|>1 and \lambda_2 is a positive power of \lambda_1, or that \lambda_1=1 and |\lambda_2|\neq 1. We prove that two formal maps with eigenvalues satisfying either of these conditions are analytically equivalent if and only if they are formally equivalent.
