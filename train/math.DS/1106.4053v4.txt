For any \theta, \omega > 1/2 we prove that, if any d-pseudotrajectory of length \sim 1/d^{\omega} of a diffeomorphism f\in C^2 can be d^{\theta}-shadowed by an exact trajectory, then f is structurally stable. Previously it was conjectured by Hammel-Grebogi-Yorke that for \theta = \omega = 1/2 this property holds for a wide class of non-uniformly hyperbolic diffeomorphisms. In the proof we introduce the notion of sublinear growth property for inhomogenious linear equations and prove that it implies exponential dichotomy.
