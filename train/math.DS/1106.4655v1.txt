J.-P. Thouvenot and the author showed via different approaches that the centralizer of a mixing rank-one infinite measure preserving transformation was trivial. In this note the author presents his joining proof. We also consider constructions with algebraic spacers as well as a class of Sidon constructions to produce new examples of mixing rank one transformations. In connection with Gordin's question on the existence of homoclinic ergodic actions for a zero entropy system we also discuss Poisson suspensions of some modifications of Sidon rank one constructions.
