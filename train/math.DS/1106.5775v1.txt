In this work the existence and properties of a global attractor for the solution semiflow of the Oregonator system are proved. The Oregonator system is the mathematical model of the famous Belousov-Zhabotinskii reaction. A rescaling and grouping estimation method is developed to show the absorbing property and the asymptotic compactness of the solution trajectories of this three-variable reaction-diffusion system with quadratic nonlinearity from the autocatalytic kinetics. It is proved that the fractal dimension of the global attractor is finite. The existence of an exponential attractor for this Oregonator semiflow is also shown.
