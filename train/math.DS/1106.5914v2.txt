Let H_1(p,q), H_2(p,q) be two time-independent Hamiltonians with one degree of freedom and \{S_1^t\}, \{S_2^t\} be the one-parametric groups of shifts along the orbits of Hamiltonian systems generated by H_1, H_2. In some problems of population genetics there appear the transformations of the plane having the form T^{(h_1,h_2)}=S^{h_2}_2\cdot S_1^{h_1} under some conditions on H_1, H_2. We study in this paper asymptotical properties of trajectories of T^{(h_1,h_2)}.
