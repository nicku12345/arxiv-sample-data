We construct a sequence of generating functions (h_n)_{n\in\N}, arbitrarily close to an integrable system in the C^r topology with r<4 for n large enough. With the variational method, we prove that for a given rotation number \omega and n large enough, the exact monotone area-preserving twist maps generated by (h_n)_{n\in\N} admit no invariant circles with rotation number \omega.
