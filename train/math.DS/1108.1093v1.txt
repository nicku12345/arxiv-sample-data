We discuss dynamics of skew product maps defined by circle diffeomorphisms forced by expanding circle maps. We construct an open class of such systems that are robust topologically mixing and for which almost all points in the same fiber converge under iteration. This property follows from the construction of an invariant attracting graph in the natural extension, a skew product of circle diffeomorphisms forced by a solenoid homeomorphism.
