This paper is a systematic study about the syndetically proximal relation and the possible existence of syndetically scrambled sets for the dynamics of continuous self-maps of compact metric spaces. Especially we consider various classes of transitive subshifts, interval maps, and topologically Anosov maps. We also present many constructions and examples.
