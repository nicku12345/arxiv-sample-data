Let S=\{s_i\in\mathbb N\cup\{0\}:0\leq s_i<s_{i+1}\} and let d_{0}=s_{0} and \Delta(S)=\{d_{n}\}_{n} where d_{n}=s_{n}-s_{n-1}. In this note, we show that an S-gap shift is subshift of finite type (SFT) if and only if S is finite or cofinite, is almost-finite-type (AFT) if and only if \Delta(S) is eventually constant and is sofic if and only if \Delta(S) is eventually periodic. We also show that there is a one-to-one correspondence between the set of all S-gap shifts and \{r \in \mathbb R: r \geq 0\}\backslash \{\frac{1}{n}: n \in {\mathbb N}\} up to conjugacy. This enables us to induce a topology and measure structure on the set of all S-gaps. By using this, we give the frequency of certain S-gap shifts with respect to their dynamical properties.
