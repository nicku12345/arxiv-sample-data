Let S=\{s_{n}\} be an increasing finite or infinite subset of \mathbb N \bigcup \{0\} and X(S) the S-gap shift associated to S. Let f_{S}(x)=1-\sum\frac{1}{x^{s_{n}+1}} be the entropy function which will be vanished at 2^{h(X(S))} where h(X(S)) is the entropy of the system. Suppose X(S) is sofic with adjacency matrix A and the characteristic polynomial \chi_{A}. Then for some rational function  Q_{S} , \chi_{A}(x)=Q_{S}(x)f_{S}(x). This  Q_{S}  will be explicitly determined. We will show that \zeta(t)=\frac{1}{f_{S}(t^{-1})} or \zeta(t)=\frac{1}{(1-t)f_{S}(t^{-1})} when |S|<\infty or |S|=\infty respectively. Here \zeta is the zeta function of X(S). We will also compute the Bowen-Franks groups of a sofic S-gap shift.
