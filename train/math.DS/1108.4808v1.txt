We investigate rational maps with period one and two cluster cycles. Given the definition of a cluster, we show that, in the case where the degree is d and the cluster is fixed, the Thurston class of a rational map is fixed by the combinatorial rotation number \rho and the critical displacement \delta of the cluster cycle. The same result will also be proved in the case that the rational map is quadratic and has a period two cluster cycle, but that the statement is no longer true in the higher degree case.
