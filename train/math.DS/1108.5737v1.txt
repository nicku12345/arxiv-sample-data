Given a measure preserving transformation T on a Lebesgue \sigma algebra, a complete T invariant sub \sigma algebra is said to split if there is another complete T invariant sub \sigma algebra on which T is Bernoulli which is completely independent of the given sub \sigma algebra and such that the two sub \sigma algebras together generate the entire \sigma algebra. It is easily shown that two splitting sub \sigma algebras with nothing in common imply T to be K. Here it is shown that T does not have to be Bernoulli by exhibiting two such non-intersecting \sigma algebras for the T,T^{-1} transformation, negatively answering a question posed by Thouvenot in 1975.
