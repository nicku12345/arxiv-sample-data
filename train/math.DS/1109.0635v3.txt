For a measure preserving transformation T of a probability space (X,\mathcal F,\mu) we investigate almost sure and distributional convergence of random variables of the form x \to \frac{1}{C_n} \sum_{i_1<n,...,i_d<n} f(T^{i_1}x,...,T^{i_d}x),\, n=1,2,...,  where f (called the \emph{kernel}) is a function from X^d to \R and C_1, C_2,... are appropriate normalizing constants. We observe that the above random variables are well defined and belong to L_r(\mu) provided that the kernel is chosen from the projective tensor product L_p(X_1,\mathcal F_1, \mu_1) \otimes_{\pi}...\otimes_{\pi} L_p(X_d,\mathcal F_d, \mu_d)\subset L_p(\mu^d) with p=d\,r,\, r\ \in [1, \infty). We establish a form of the individual ergodic theorem for such sequences. Next, we give a martingale approximation argument to derive a central limit theorem in the non-degenerate case (in the sense of the classical Hoeffding's decomposition). Furthermore, for d=2 and a wide class of canonical kernels f we also show that the convergence holds in distribution towards a quadratic form \sum_{m=1}^{\infty} \lambda_m\eta^2_m in independent standard Gaussian variables \eta_1, \eta_2,.... Our results on the distributional convergence use a T--\,invariant filtration as a prerequisite and are derived from uni- and multivariate martingale approximations.
