Consider a rational map f of degree at least 2 acting on its Julia set J(f), a H\"older continuous potential \phi: J(f)\rightarrow \R and the pressure P(f,\phi). In the case where \sup_{J(f)}\phi<P(f,phi), the uniqueness and stochastic properties of the corresponding equilibrium states have been extensively studied. In this paper we characterize those potentials \phi for which this property is satisfied for some iterate of f, in terms of the expanding properties of the corresponding equilibrium states. A direct consequence of this result is that for a nonuniformly hyperbolic rational map every H\"older continuous potential has a unique equilibrium state and that this measure is exponentially mixing.
