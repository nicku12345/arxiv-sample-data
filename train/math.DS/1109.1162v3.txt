We adapt the notion of processes to introduce an abstract framework for dynamics in finite time, i.e.\ on compact time sets. For linear finite-time processes a notion of hyperbolicity namely exponential monotonicity dichotomy (EMD) is introduced, thereby generalizing and unifying several existing approaches. We present a spectral theory for linear processes in a coherent way, based only on a logarithmic difference quotient, prove robustness of EMD with respect to a suitable (semi-)metric and provide exact perturbation bounds. Furthermore, we give a complete description of the local geometry around hyperbolic trajectories, including a direct and intrinsic proof of finite-time analogues of the local (un)stable manifold theorem and theorem of linearized asymptotic stability. As an application, we discuss our results for ordinary differential equations on a compact time-interval.
