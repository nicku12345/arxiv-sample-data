Following [6,12], we study coupled map networks over arbitrary finite graphs. An estimate from below for a topological entropy of a perturbed coupled map network via a topological entropy of an unperturbed network by making use of the covering relations for coupled map networks is obtained. The result is quite general, particularly no assumptions on hyperbolicity of a local dynamics or linearity of coupling are made.
