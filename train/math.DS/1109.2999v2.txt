After relating the notion of \omega-recurrence in skew products to the range of values taken by partial ergodic sums and Lyapunov exponents, ergodic \mathbb{Z}-valued cocycles over an irrational rotation are presented in detail. First, the generic situation is studied and shown to be 1/n-recurrent. It is then shown that for any \omega(n) <n^{-\epsilon}, where \epsilon>1/2, there are uncountably many infinite staircases (a certain specific cocycle over a rotation) which are \textit{not} \omega-recurrent, and therefore have positive Lyapunov exponent. A further section makes brief remarks regarding cocycles over interval exchange transformations of periodic type.
