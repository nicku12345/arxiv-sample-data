We show that if f \colon S^1 \times S^1 \to S^1 \times S^1 is C^2, with f(x, t) = (f_t(x), t), and the rotation number of f_t is equal to t for all t \in S^1, then f is topologically conjugate to the linear Dehn twist of the torus (1&1 0&1). We prove a differentiability result where the assumption that the rotation number of f_t is t is weakened to say that the rotation number is strictly monotone in t.
