We investigate (local) Minkowski measurability of \mathcal C^{1+\alpha} images of self-similar sets. We show that (local) Minkowski measurability of a self-similar set K implies (local) Minkowski measurability of its image F and provide an explicit formula for the (local) Minkowski content of F in this case. A counterexample is presented which shows that the converse is not necessarily true. That is, F can be Minkowski measurable although K is not. However, we obtain that an average version of the (local) Minkowski content of both K and F always exists and also provide an explicit formula for the relation between the (local) average Minkowski contents of K and F.
