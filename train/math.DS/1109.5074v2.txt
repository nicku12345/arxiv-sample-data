We consider low-dimensional systems with the shadowing property. In dimension two, we show that the shadowing property for a homeomorphism implies the existence of periodic orbits in every \epsilon-transitive class, and in contrast we provide an example of a C^\infty Kupka-Smale diffeomorphism with the shadowing property exhibiting an aperiodic transitive class. Finally we consider the case of transitive endomorphisms of the circle, and we prove that the \alpha-H\"older shadowing property with \alpha>1/2 implies that the system is conjugate to an expanding map.
