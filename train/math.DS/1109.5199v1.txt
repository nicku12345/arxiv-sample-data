This paper generalizes the results of [13] and then provides an interesting example. We construct a family of W-like maps \{W_a\} with a turning fixed point having slope s_1 on one side and -s_2 on the other. Each W_a has an absolutely continuous invariant measure \mu_a. Depending on whether \frac{1}{s_1}+\frac{1}{s_2} is larger, equal or smaller than 1, we show that the limit of \mu_a is a singular measure, a combination of singular and absolutely continuous measure or an absolutely continuous measure, respectively. It is known that the invariant density of a single piecewise expanding map has a positive lower bound on its support. In Section 4 we give an example showing that in general, for a family of piecewise expanding maps with slopes larger than 2 in modulus and converging to a piecewise expanding map, their invariant densities do not necessarily have a positive lower bound on the support.
