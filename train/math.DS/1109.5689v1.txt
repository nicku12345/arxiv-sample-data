The well-studied Hindmarsh-Rose model of neural action potential is revisited from the point of view of global bifurcation analysis. This slow-fast system of three paremeterised differential equations is arguably the simplest reduction of Hodgkin-Huxley models capable of exhibiting all qualitatively important distinct kinds of spiking and bursting behaviour. First, keeping the singular perturbation parameter fixed, a comprehensive two-parameter bifurcation diagram is computed by brute force. Of particular concern is the parameter regime where lobe-shaped regions of irregular bursting undergo a transition to stripe-shaped regions of periodic bursting. The boundary of each stripe represents a fold bifurcation that causes a smooth spike-adding transition where the number of spikes in each burst is increased by one. Next, numerical continuation studies reveal that the global structure is organised by various curves of homoclinic bifurcations.   In particular the lobe to stripe transition is organised by a sequence of codimension-two orbit- and inclination-flip points that occur along {\em each} homoclinic branch. Each branch undergoes a sharp turning point and hence approximately has a double-cover of the same curve in parameter space. The sharp turn is explained in terms of the interaction between a two-dimensional unstable manifold and a one-dimensional slow manifold in the singular limit. Finally, a new local analysis is undertaken using approximate Poincar\'{e} maps to show that the turning point on each homoclinic branch in turn induces an inclination flip that gives birth to the fold curve that organises the spike-adding transition. Implications of this mechanism for explaining spike-adding behaviour in other excitable systems are discussed.
