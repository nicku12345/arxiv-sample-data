We extend the Killeen-Taylor study in \cite{KT} by investigating in different Banach spaces (\ell^\alpha(\N), c_0(\N),c_c(\N)) the point, continuous and residual spectra of stochastic perturbations of the shift operator associated to the stochastic adding machine in base 2 and in Fibonacci base. For the base 2, the spectra are connected to the Julia set of a quadratic map. In the Fibonacci case, the spectra involve the Julia set of an endomorphism of \C^2.
