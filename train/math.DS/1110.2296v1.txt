The paper consists of two sections. In Section 1, we give a short review of KAM theory with an emphasis on Whitney smooth families of invariant tori in typical Hamiltonian and reversible systems. In Section 2, we prove a KAM-type result for non-autonomous reversible systems (depending quasi-periodically on time) within the almost unexplored reversible context 2. This context refers to the situation where dim Fix G < (1/2) codim T, here Fix G is the fixed point manifold of the reversing involution G and T is the invariant torus one deals with.
