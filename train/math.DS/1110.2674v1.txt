Classical Kleinian groups are discrete subgroups of PSL(2,\C) acting on the complex projective line \P^1, which actually coincides with the Riemann sphere, with non-empty region of discontinuity. These can also be regarded as the monodromy groups of certain differential equations. These groups have played a major role in many aspects of mathematics for decades, and also in physics. It is thus natural to study discrete subgroups of the projective group PSL(n,\C),  n > 2. Surprisingly, this is a branch of mathematics which is in its childhood, and in this article we give an overview of it.
