In this paper we investigate multifractal decompositions based on values of Birkhoff averages of functions from a class of symbolically continuous functions. This will be done for an expanding interval map with infinitely many branches and is a generalisation of previous work for expanding maps with finitely many branches. We show that there are substantial differences between this case and the setting where the expanding map has only finitely many branches.
