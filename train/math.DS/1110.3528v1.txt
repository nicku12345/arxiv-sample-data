In this note we consider W-shaped map W_0=W_{s_1,s_2} with \frac {1}{s_1}+\frac {1}{s_2}=1 and show that eigenvalue 1 is not stable. We do this in a constructive way. For each perturbing map W_a we show the existence of the "second" eigenvalue \lambda_a, such that \lambda_a\to 1, as a\to 0, which proves instability of isolated spectrum of W_0. At the same time, the existence of second eigenvalues close to 1 causes the maps W_a behave in a metastable way. They have two almost invariant sets and the system spends long periods of consecutive iterations in each of them with infrequent jumps from one to the other.
