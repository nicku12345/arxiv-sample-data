We explore the convergence/divergence of the normal form for a singularity of a vector field on \C^n with nilpotent linear part. We show that a Gevrey-\alpha vector field X with a nilpotent linear part can be reduced to a normal form of Gevrey-1+\alpha type with the use of a Gevrey-1+\alpha transformation. We also give a proof of the existence of an optimal order to stop the normal form procedure. If one stops the normal form procedure at this order, the remainder becomes exponentially small.
