In computing the third order terms of the series of powers of the center manifold at an equilibrium point of a scalar delay differential equation, with a single constant delay r>0, some problems occur at the term w_{21}z^2\bar{z}. More precisely, in order to determine the values at 0, respectively -r of the function w_{21}(\,.\,), an algebraic system of equations must be solved. We show that the two equations are dependent, hence the system has an infinity of solutions. Then we show how we can overcome this lack of uniqueness and provide a formula for w_{21}(0).
