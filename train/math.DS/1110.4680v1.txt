The paper concerns fractal homeomorphism between the attractors of two bi-affine iterated function systems. After a general discussion of bi-affine functions, conditions are provided under which a bi-affine iterated function system is contractive, thus guaranteeing an attractor. After a general discussion of fractal homeomorphism, fractal homeomorphisms are constructed for a specific type of bi-affine iterated function system.
