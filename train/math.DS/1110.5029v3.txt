The classical Juzvinski\u{i} Addition Theorem states that the entropy of an automorphism of a compact group decomposes along invariant subgroups. Thomas generalized the theorem to a skew-product setting. Using L. Bowen's f-invariant we prove the addition theorem for actions of finitely generated free groups on skew-products with compact totally disconnected groups or compact Lie groups (correcting an error from [Bo10c]) and discuss examples.
