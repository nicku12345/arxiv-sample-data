We characterize finite sets S of nonwandering points for generic diffeomorphisms f as those which are {\em uniformly bounded}, i.e., there is an uniform bound for small perturbations of the derivative of f along the points in S up to suitable iterates. We use this result to give a C^1 generic characterization of the Morse-Smale diffeomorphisms related to the weak Palis conjecture \cite{c}. Furthermore, we obtain another proof of the result by Liao and Pliss about the finiteness of sinks and sources for star diffeomorphisms \cite{l}, \cite{Pl}.
