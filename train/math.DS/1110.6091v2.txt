In this paper we prove that for an ergodic hyperbolic measure \omega of a C^{1+\alpha} diffeomorphism f on a Riemannian manifold M, there is an \omega-full measured set \widetilde{\Lambda} such that for every invariant probability \mu\in \mathcal{M}_{inv}(\widetilde{\Lambda},f), the metric entropy of \mu is equal to the topological entropy of saturated set G_{\mu} consisting of generic points of \mu: h_\mu(f)=h_{\top}(f,G_{\mu}). Moreover, for every nonempty, compact and connected subset K of \mathcal{M}_{inv}(\widetilde{\Lambda},f) with the same hyperbolic rate, we compute the topological entropy of saturated set G_K of K by the following equality: \inf\{h_\mu(f)\mid \mu\in K\}=h_{\top}(f,G_K).   In particular these results can be applied (i) to the nonuniformy hyperbolic diffeomorphisms described by Katok, (ii) to the robustly transitive partially hyperbolic diffeomorphisms described by ~Ma{\~{n}}{\'{e}}, (iii) to the robustly transitive non-partially hyperbolic diffeomorphisms described by Bonatti-Viana. In all these cases \mathcal{M}_{inv}(\widetilde{\Lambda},f) contains an open subset of \mathcal{M}_{erg}(M,f).
