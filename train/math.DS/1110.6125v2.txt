Let f_i\in C^{2+\alpha}(S^1\setminus \{a_i,b_i\}), \alpha >0, i=1,2 be circle homeomorphisms with two break points a_i,b_i, i.e. discontinuities in the derivative f_i, with identical irrational rotation number rho and \mu_1([a_1,b_1])= \mu_2([a_2,b_2]), where \mu_i are invariant measures of f_i. Suppose the products of the jump ratios of Df_1 and Df_2 do not coincide, i.e. \frac{Df_1(a_1-0)}{Df_1(a_1+0)}\times \frac{Df_1(b_1-0)}{Df_1(b_1+0)}\neq \frac{Df_2(a_2-0)}{Df_2(a_2+0)}\times \frac{Df_2(b_2-0)}{Df_2(b_2+0)}. Then the map \psi conjugating f_1 and f_2 is a singular function, i.e. it is continuous on S^1, but D\psi = 0 a.e. with respect to Lebesgue measure
