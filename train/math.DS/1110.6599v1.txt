In this paper, d-step almost automorphic systems are studied for d\in\N, which are the generalization of the classical almost automorphic ones.   For a minimal topological dynamical system (X,T) it is shown that the condition x\in X is d-step almost automorphic can be characterized via various subsets of \Z including the dual sets of d-step Poincar\'e and Birkhoff recurrence sets, and Nil_d Bohr_0-sets by considering N(x,V)=\{n\in\Z: T^nx\in V\}, where V is an arbitrary neighborhood of x. Moreover, it turns out that the condition (x,y)\in X\times X is regionally proximal of order d can also be characterized via various subsets of \Z including d-step Poincar\'e and Birkhoff recurrence sets, SG_d sets, the dual sets of Nil_d Bohr_0-sets, and others by considering N(x,U)=\{n\in\Z: T^nx\in U\}, where U is an arbitrary neighborhood of y.
