The families of right (left) translation finite subsets of a discrete infinite group \Gamma are defined and shown to be ideals. Their kernels Z_R and Z_L are identified as the closure of the set of products pq (p\cdot q) in the \v{C}ech-Stone compactification \beta\Gamma. Consequently it is shown that the map \pi: \beta\Gamma \to \Gamma^{WAP}, the canonical semigroup homomorphism from \beta\Gamma onto \Gamma^{WAP}, the universal semitopological semigroup compactification of \Gamma, is a homeomorphism on the complement of Z_R \cup Z_L.
