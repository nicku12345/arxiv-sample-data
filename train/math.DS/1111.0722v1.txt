In this paper, we prove that there exist at least [\frac{n+1}{2}]+1 geometrically distinct brake orbits on every C^2 compact convex symmetric hypersurface \Sg in \R^{2n} for n\ge 2 satisfying the reversible condition N\Sg=\Sg with N=\diag (-I_n,I_n). As a consequence, we show that there exist at least [\frac{n+1}{2}]+1 geometrically distinct brake orbits in every bounded convex symmetric domain in \R^{n} with n\ge 2 which gives a positive answer to the Seifert conjecture of 1948 in the symmetric case for n=3. As an application, for n=4 and 5, we prove that if there are exactly n geometrically distinct closed characteristics on \Sg, then all of them are symmetric brake orbits after suitable time translation.
