Let K be a complete ultrametric field. We give lower and upper bounds for the size of linearization discs for power series over K near hyperbolic fixed points. These estimates are maximal in the sense that there exist examples where these estimates give the exact size of the corresponding linearization disc. In particular, at repelling fixed points, the linearization disc is equal to the maximal disc on which the power series is injective.
