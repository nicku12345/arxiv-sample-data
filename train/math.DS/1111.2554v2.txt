The entropy h(T_\alpha) of \alpha-continued fraction transformations is known to be locally monotone outside a closed, totally disconnected set \EE. We will exploit the explicit description of the fractal structure of \EE to investigate the self-similarities displayed by the graph of the function \alpha \mapsto h(T_\alpha). Finally, we completely characterize the plateaux occurring in this graph, and classify the local monotonic behaviour.
