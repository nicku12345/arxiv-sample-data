We investigate the local integrability and linearizability of three dimensional Lotka-Volterra equations at the origin. Necessary and sufficient conditions for both integrability and linearizability are obtained for (1,-1,1), (2,-1,1) and (1,-2,1)-resonance. To prove sufficiency, we mainly use the method of Darboux with extensions for inverse Jacobi multipliers, and the linearizability of a node in two variables with power-series arguments in the third variable.
