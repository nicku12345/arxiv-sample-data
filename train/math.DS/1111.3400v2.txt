We consider Holder continuous linear cocycles over partially hyperbolic diffeomorphisms. For fiber bunched cocycles with one Lyapunov exponent we show continuity of measurable invariant conformal structures and sub-bundles. Further, we establish a continuous version of Zimmer's Amenable Reduction Theorem. For cocycles over hyperbolic systems we also obtain polynomial growth estimates for the norm and quasiconformal distortion from the periodic data.
