Let f and g be smooth multimodal maps with no periodic attractors and no neutral points. If a topological conjugacy h between f and g is C^{1} at a point in the nearby expanding set of f, then h is a smooth diffeomorphism in the basin of attraction of a renormalization interval of f. In particular, if f:I \to I and g:J \to J are C^r unimodal maps and h is C^{1} at a boundary of I then h is C^r in I.
