A dynamical system is a triple (A,G,\alpha), consisting of a unital locally convex algebra A, a topological group G and a group homomorphism \alpha:G\rightarrow\Aut(A), which induces a continuous action of G on A. Further, a unital locally convex algebra A is called continuous inverse algebra, or CIA for short, if its group of units A^{\times} is open in A and the inversion \iota:A^{\times}\rightarrow A^{\times},\,\,\,a\mapsto a^{-1} is continuous at 1_A. For a compact manifold M, the Fr\'echet algebra of smooth functions C^{\infty}(M) is the prototype of such a continuous inverse algebra. We show that if A is a complete commutative CIA, G a compact group and (A,G,\alpha) a dynamical system, then each character of B:=A^G can be extended to a character of A. In particular, the natural map on the level of the corresponding spectra \Gamma_A\rightarrow\Gamma_B, \chi\mapsto\chi_{\mid B} is surjective.
