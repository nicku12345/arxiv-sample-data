This paper defines and discusses the dimension notion of topological slow entropy of any subset for Z^d actions. Also, the notion of measure-theoretic slow entropy for Z^d actions is presented, which is modified from Brin and Katok [2]. Relations between Bowen topological entropy [3,17] and topological slow entropy are studied in this paper, and several examples of the topological slow entropy in a symbolic system are given. Specifically, a variational principle is proved.
