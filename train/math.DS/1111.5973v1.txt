The purpose of this paper is to give an illustration of results on integrability of distributions and orbits of vector fields on Banach manifolds obtained in [Pe] and [LaPe]. Using arguments and results of these papers, in the context of a separable Hilbert space, we give a generalization of a Theorem of accessibility contained in [Ha], [Ro] and proved for a finite dimensional Hilbert space
