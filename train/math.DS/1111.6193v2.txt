We ascertain the diffusively scaled limit of a periodic Lorentz process in a strip with an almost reflecting wall at the origin. Here, almost reflecting means that the wall contains a small hole waning in time. The limiting process is a quasi-reflected Brownian motion, which is Markovian but not strong Markovian. Local time results for the periodic Lorentz process, having independent interest, are also found and used.
