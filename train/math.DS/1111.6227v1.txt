In this note we give simple examples of a one-dimensional mixing subshift with positive topological entropy which have two distinct measures of maximal entropy. We also give examples of subshifts which have two mutually singular equilibrium states for H\"{o}lder continuous functions. We also indicate how the construction can be extended to yield examples with any number of measures of maximal entropy of equilibrium states.
