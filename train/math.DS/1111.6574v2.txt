We study dimensions of strange non-chaotic attractors and their associated physical measures in so-called pinched skew products, introduced by Grebogi and his coworkers in 1984. Our main results are that the Hausdorff dimension, the pointwise dimension and the information dimension are all equal to one, although the box-counting dimension is known to be two. The assertion concerning the pointwise dimension is deduced from the stronger result that the physical measure is rectifiable. Our findings confirm a conjecture by Ding, Grebogi and Ott from 1989.
