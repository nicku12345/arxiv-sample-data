It is well-known that the existence of traveling wave solutions for reaction-diffusion partial differential equations can be proved by showing the existence of certain heteroclinic orbits for related autonomous planar differential equations. We introduce a method for finding explicit upper and lower bounds of these heteroclinic orbits. In particular, for the classical Fisher-Kolmogorov equation we give rational upper and lower bounds which allow to locate these solutions analytically and with very high accuracy.
