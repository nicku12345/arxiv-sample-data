We study a random map T which consists of intermittent maps \{T_{k}\}_{k=1}^{K} and a position dependent probability distribution \{p_{k,\varepsilon}(x)\}_{k=1}^{K}. We prove existence of a unique absolutely continuous invariant measure (ACIM) for the random map T. Moreover, we show that, as \varepsilon goes to zero, the invariant density of the random system T converges in the L^{1}-norm to the invariant density of the deterministic intermittent map T_{1}. The outcome of this paper contains a first result on stochastic stability, in the strong sense, of intermittent maps.
