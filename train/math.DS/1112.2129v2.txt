Using the damped pendulum system we introduce the averaging method to study the periodic solutions of a dynamical system with small perturbation. We provide sufficient conditions for the existence of periodic solutions with small amplitude of the non--linear perturbed damped pendulum. The averaging theory provides a useful means to study dynamical systems, accessible to Master and PhD students.
