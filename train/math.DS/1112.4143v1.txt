We explore different families of quasi-periodically Forced Logistic Maps for the existence of universality and self-similarity properties. In the bifurcation diagram of the Logistic Map it is well known that there exist parameter values s_n where the 2^n-periodic orbit is superattracting. Moreover these parameter values lay between one period doubling and the next. Under quasi-periodic forcing, the superattracting periodic orbits give birth to two reducibility-loss bifurcations in the two dimensional parameter space of the Forced Logistic Map, both around the points s_n. In the present work we study numerically the asymptotic behavior of the slopes of these bifurcations with respect to n. This study evidences the existence of universality properties and self-similarity of the bifurcation diagram in the parameter space.
