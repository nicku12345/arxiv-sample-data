We study dynamics in a neighborhood of a nonhyperbolic fixed point or an irreducible homoclinic tangent point. General type conditions for the existence of infinite sets of periodic points are obtained. A new method, based on the study of the dynamics of center disks, is introduced. Some results on shadowing near a non-hyperbolic fixed point of a homeomorphism are obtained.
