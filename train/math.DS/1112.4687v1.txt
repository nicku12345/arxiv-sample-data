In a previous work by the authors the one dimensional (doubling) renormalization operator was extended to the case of quasi-periodically forced one dimensional maps. The theory was used to explain different self-similarity and universality observed numerically in the parameter space of the Forced Logistic Maps. The extension proposed was not complete in the sense that we assumed a total of four conjectures to be true. In this paper we present numerical support for these conjectures. We also discuss the applicability of this theory to the Forced Logistic Map.
