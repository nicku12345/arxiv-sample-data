In the case when X is a sofic shift and \phi : X \to X is a homeomorphism such that \phi^2 = \text{id}_X and \phi \sigma_X = \sigma_X^{-1} \phi, the number of points in X that are fixed by \sigma_X^m and \sigma_X^n \phi, m=1,2,..., n\in\Bbb Z, is expressed in terms of a finite number of square matrices: The matrices are obtained from Krieger's joint state chain of a sofic shift which is conjugate to X.
