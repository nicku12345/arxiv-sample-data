Mixing (of all orders) rank-one actions T of Heisenberg group H_3(\Bbb R) are constructed. The restriction of T to the center of H_3(\Bbb R) is simple and commutes only with T. Mixing Poisson and mixing Gaussian actions of H_3(\Bbb R) are also constructed. A rigid weakly mixing rank-one action T is constructed such that the restriction of T to the center of H_3(\Bbb R) is not isomorphic to its inverse.
