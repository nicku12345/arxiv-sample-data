For n\geq 1 we consider the class JP(n) of dynamical systems whose every ergodic joining with a Cartesian product of k weakly mixing automorphisms (k\geq n) can be represented as the independent extension of a joining of the system with only n coordinate factors. For n\geq 2 we show that, whenever the maximal spectral type of a weakly mixing automorphism T is singular with respect to the convolution of any n continuous measures, i.e. T has the so-called convolution singularity property of order n, then T belongs to JP(n-1). To provide examples of such automorphisms, we exploit spectral simplicity on symmetric Fock spaces. This also allows us to show that for any n\geq 2 the class JP(n) is essentially larger than JP(n-1). Moreover, we show that all members of JP(n) are disjoint from ergodic automorphisms generated by infinitely divisible stationary processes.
