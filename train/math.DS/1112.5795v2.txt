We Investigate two types of dual identities for Riemann fractional sums and differences. The first type relates nabla and delta type fractional sums and differences. The second type represented by the Q-operator relates left and right fractional sums and differences. These dual identities insist that in the definition of right fractional differences we have to use both the nabla and delta operators. The solution representation for higher order Riemann fractional difference equation is obtained as well.
