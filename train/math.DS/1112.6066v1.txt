This article concerns a class of open billiards consisting of a finite number of strictly convex, non-eclipsing obstacles K. The non-wandering set M_0 of the billiard ball map is a topological Cantor set and its Hausdorff dimension has been previously estimated for billiards in \mathbb{R}^2, using well-known techniques. We extend these estimates to billiards in \mathbb{R}^n, and make various refinements to the estimates. These refinements also allow improvements to other results. We also show that in many cases, the non-wandering set is confined to a particular subset of \mathbb{R}^n formed by the convex hull of points determined by period 2 orbits. This allows more accurate bounds on the constants used in estimating Hausdorff dimension.
