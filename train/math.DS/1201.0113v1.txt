We consider the set of bimodal linear systems consisting of two linear dynamics acting on each side of a given hyperplane, assuming continuity along the separating hyperplane. Focusing on the unobservable planar ones, we obtain a simple explicit characterization of controllability. Moreover, we apply the canonical forms of these systems depending on two state variables to obtain explicitly miniversal deformations, to illustrate bifurcation diagrams and to prove that the unobservable controllable systems are stabilizable.
