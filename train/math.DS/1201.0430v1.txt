Domino tilings have been studied extensively for both their statistical properties and their dynamical properties. We construct a subshift of finite type using matching rules for several types of dominos. We combine the previous results about domino tilings to show that our subshift of finite type has a measure of maximal entropy with which the subshift has completely positive entropy but is not isomorphic to a Bernoulli shift.
