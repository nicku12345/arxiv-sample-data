This article deals with nonwandering (e.g. area-preserving) homeomorphisms of the torus \mathbb{T}^2 which are homotopic to the identity and strictly toral, in the sense that they exhibit dynamical properties that are not present in homeomorphisms of the annulus or the plane. This includes all homeomorphisms which have a rotation set with nonempty interior. We define two types of points: inessential and essential. The set of inessential points ine(f) is shown to be a disjoint union of periodic topological disks ("elliptic islands"), while the set of essential points ess(f) is an essential continuum, with typically rich dynamics (the "chaotic region"). This generalizes and improves a similar description by J\"ager. The key result is boundedness of these "elliptic islands", which allows, among other things, to obtain sharp (uniform) bounds of the diffusion rates. We also show that the dynamics in ess(f) is as rich as in \mathbb{T}^2 from the rotational viewpoint, and we obtain results relating the existence of large invariant topological disks to the abundance of fixed points.
