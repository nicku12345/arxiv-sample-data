In the present work, the notion of Super Fractal Interpolation Function (SFIF) is introduced for finer simulation of the objects of the nature or outcomes of scientific experiments that reveal one or more structures embedded in to another. In the construction of SFIF, an IFS is chosen from a pool of several IFS at each level of iteration leading to implementation of the desired randomness and variability in fractal interpolation of the given data. Further, an expository description of our investigations on the integral, the smoothness and determination of conditions for existence of derivatives of a SFIF is given in the present work.
