In the present paper, multiresolution analysis arising from Coalescence Hidden-variable Fractal Interpolation Functions (CHFIFs) is accomplished. The availability of a larger set of free variables and constrained variables with CHFIF in multiresolution analysis based on CHFIFs provides more control in reconstruction of functions in L2(\mathbb{R})than that provided by multiresolution analysis based only on Affine Fractal Interpolation Functions (AFIFs). In our approach, the vector space of CHFIFs is introduced, its dimension is determined and Riesz bases of vector subspaces Vk, k \in \mathbb{Z}, consisting of certain CHFIFs in L2(\mathbb{R}) \cap C0(\mathbb{R}) are constructed. As a special case, for the vector space of CHFIFs of dimension 4, orthogonal bases for the vector subspaces Vk, k \in \mathbb{Z}, are explicitly constructed and, using these bases, compactly supported continuous orthonormal wavelets are generated.
