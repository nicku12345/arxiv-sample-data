We propose a formalism for tilings with infinite local complexity (ILC), and especially fusion tilings with ILC. We allow an infinite variety of tile types but require that the space of possible tile types be compact. Examples include solenoids, pinwheel tilings, tilings with fault lines, and tilings with infinitely many tile sizes, shapes, or labels. Special attention is given to tilings where the infinite local complexity comes purely from geometry (shears) or comes purely from combinatorics (labels). We examine spectral properties of the invariant measures and define a new notion of complexity that applies to ILC tilings.
