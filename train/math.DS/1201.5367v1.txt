Consider homogeneous G/H and G/F, for an S-algebraic group G. A lattice {\Gamma} acts on the left strictly conservatively. The following rigidity results are obtained: morphisms, factors and joinings defined apriori only in the measurable category are in fact algebraically constrained. Arguing in an elementary fashion we manage to classify all the measurable {\Phi} commuting with the {\Gamma}-action: assuming ergodicity, we find they are algebraically defined.
