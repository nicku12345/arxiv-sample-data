The symbolic complexity of an infinite word W is the function p_W(l) counting the number of different subwords in W of length l. In this paper our main purpose is to study the complexity for a class of topological dynamical systems, called iceberg systems, given by the following symbolic procedure. Starting from a given finite word w_1 we construct a sequence of words w_{n+1} = w_n \rho_{a_n(1)}(w_n)...\rho_{a_n(q_n-1)}(w_n), where \rho_a(u) is the cyclic rotations of the word u by a positions, and consider an infinite word W extending each w_n to the right. It is shown that for iceberg systems given by the randomized parameters a_n(j) the complexity function almost surely satisfies the estimate p_W(l) > l^{3-\epsilon} for any \epsilon > 0 and l \ge l_0(\epsilon), and at the same time it is observed that this estimate represents up to a small correction the optimal lower bound for the complexity function, namely, p_{w_{n+1}}(l_n) \le l_n^3 along the subsequence l_n = |w_n|+1.
