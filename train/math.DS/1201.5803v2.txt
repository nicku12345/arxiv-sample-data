Let f: \mathbb{T}^2 \to \mathbb{T}^2 be a homeomorphism homotopic to the identity and F: \mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{R}^2 a lift of f such that the rotation set \rho(F) is a line segment of rational slope containing a point in \mathbb{Q}^2. We prove that if f is ergodic with respect to the Lebesgue measure on the torus and the average rotation vector (with respect to same measure) does not belong to \mathbb{Q}^2 then some power of f is an annular homeomorphism.
