We consider sufficient conditions to determine the global dynamics for equivariant maps of the plane with a unique fixed point which is also hyperbolic. When the map is equivariant under the action of a compact Lie group, it is possible to describe the local dynamics. In particular, if the group contains a reflection, there is a line invariant by the map. This allows us to use results based on the theory of free homeomorphisms to describe the global dynamical behaviour. We briefly discuss the case when reflections are absent, for which global dynamics may not follow from local dynamics near the unique fixed point.
