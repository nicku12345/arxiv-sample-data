This paper deals with front propagation dynamics of monostable equations with nonlocal dispersal in spatially periodic habitats. In the authors' earlier works, it is shown that a general spatially periodic monostable equation with nonlocal dispersal has a unique spatially periodic positive stationary solution and has a spreading speed in every direction. In this paper, we show that a spatially periodic nonlocal monostable equation with certain spatial homogeneity or small nonlocal dispersal distance has a unique stable periodic traveling wave solutions connecting its unique spatially periodic positive stationary solution and the trivial solution in every direction for all speeds greater than the spreading speed in that direction.
