We investigate Newton's method for complex polynomials of arbitrary degree d, normalized so that all their roots are in the unit disk. For each degree d, we give an explicit set \mathcal{S}_d of 3.33d\log^2 d(1 + o(1)) points with the following universal property: for every normalized polynomial of degree d there are d starting points in \mathcal{S}_d whose Newton iterations find all the roots with a low number of iterations: if the roots are uniformly and independently distributed, we show that with probability at least 1-2/d the number of iterations for these d starting points to reach all roots with precision \varepsilon is O(d^2\log^4 d + d\log|\log \varepsilon|). This is an improvement of an earlier result in \cite{Schleicher}, where the number of iterations is shown to be O(d^4\log^2 d + d^3\log^2d|\log \varepsilon|) in the worst case (allowing multiple roots) and O(d^3\log^2 d(\log d + \log \delta) + d\log|\log \varepsilon|) for well-separated (so-called \delta-separated) roots.   Our result is almost optimal for this kind of starting points in the sense that the number of iterations can never be smaller than O(d^2) for fixed \varepsilon.
