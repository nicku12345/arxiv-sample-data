We consider an abundant class of non-uniformly hyperbolic C^2-H\'enon like diffeomorphisms called strongly regular and which corresponds to Benedicks-Carleson parameters. We prove the existence of m>0 such that for any such diffeomorphism f, every invariant probability measure of f has a Lyapunov exponent greater than m, answering a question of L. Carleson. Moreover, we show the existence and uniqueness of a measure of maximal entropy, this answers a question of M. Lyubich and Y. Pesin. We also prove that the maximal entropy measure is equi-distributed on the periodic points and is finitarily Bernoulli, which gives an answer to a question of J.P. Thouvenot. Finally, we show that the maximal entropy measure is exponentially mixing and satisfies the central limit Theorem. The proof is based on a new construction of Young tower for which the first return time coincides with the symbolic return time, and whose orbit is conjugated to a strongly positive recurrent Markov shift.
