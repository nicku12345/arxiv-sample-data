We introduce the Plaque Topology on the inverse limit of a branched covering self-map of a Riemann surface of a finite degree greater than one. We present the notions of regular and irregular points in the setting of this Plaque Inverse Limit and study its local topological properties at the irregular points. We construct certain Boolean Algebra and certain sigma-lattice, derived from it, and use them to compute local topological invariants of the Plaque Inverse Limit. Finally, we obtain several results interrelating the dynamics of the forward iterations of the self-map and the topology of the Plaque Inverse Limit.
