If G is a finitely generated group with generators \{g_1,..., g_s\}, we say an infinite-order element f \in G is a distortion element of G provided that \displaystyle \liminf_{n \to \infty} \frac{|f^n|}{n} = 0, where |f^n| is the word length of f^n with respect to the given generators. Let S be a compact orientable surface, possibly with boundary, and let \Diff(S)_0 denote the identity component of the group of C^1 diffeomorphisms of S. Our main result is that if S has genus at least two, and f is a distortion element in some finitely generated subgroup of \Diff(S)_0, then \supp(\mu) \subseteq \Fix(f) for every f-invariant Borel probability measure \mu. Under a small additional hypothesis the same holds in lower genus.   For \mu a Borel probability measure on S, denote the group of C^1 diffeomorphisms that preserve \mu by \Diff_\mu(S). Our main result implies that a large class of higher-rank lattices admit no homomorphisms to \Diff_{\mu}(S) with infinite image. These results generalize those of Franks and Handel to surfaces with boundary.
