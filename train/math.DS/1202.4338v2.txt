We generalize two classical results of Maizel and Pliss that describe relations between hyperbolicity properties of linear system of difference equations and its ability to have a bounded solution for every bounded inhomogeneity. We also apply one of this generalizations in shadowing theory of diffeomorphisms to prove that some sort of limit shadowing is equivalent to structural stability.
