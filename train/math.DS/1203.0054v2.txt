We present a KAM theorem for presymplectic dynamical systems. The theorem has a " a posteriori " format. We show that given a Diophantine frequency \omega and a family of presymplectic mappings, if we find an embedded torus which is approximately invariant with rotation \omega such that the torus and the family of mappings satisfy some explicit non-degeneracy condition, then we can find an embedded torus and a value of the parameter close to to the original ones so that the torus is invariant under the map associated to the value of the parameter. Furthermore, we show that the dimension of the parameter space is reduced if we assume that the systems are exact.
