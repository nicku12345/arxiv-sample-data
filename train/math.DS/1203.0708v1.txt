This paper is the first in a series of papers which will address, on a case by case basis, the special cases of the following rational system in the plane, labeled system #11. x_{n+1}=\frac{\alpha_{1}}{A_{1}+y_{n}},\quad y_{n+1}=\frac{\alpha_{2}+\beta_{2}x_{n}+\gamma_{2}y_{n}}{A_{2}+B_{2}x_{n}+C_{2}y_{n}},\quad n=0,1,2,..., with \alpha_{1},A_{1}>0 and \alpha_{2}, \beta_{2}, \gamma_{2}, A_{2}, B_{2}, C_{2}\geq 0 and \alpha_{2}+\beta_{2}+\gamma_{2}>0 and A_{2}+B_{2}+C_{2}>0 and nonnegative initial conditions x_{0} and y_{0} so that the denominator is never zero. In this article we focus on the special cases which are reducible to the Riccati difference equation.
