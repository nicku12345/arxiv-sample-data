In this paper, we state with a variational method a general theorem providing the existence of a weak solution u for fractional Euler-Lagrange equations of the type:  \dfrac{\partial L}{\partial x} (u,D^\alpha_- u,t) + D^\alpha_+ (\dfrac{\partial L}{\partial y} (u,D^\alpha_- u,t)) = 0  on a real interval [a,b] and where D^\alpha_- and D^\alpha_+ are the fractional derivatives of Riemann-Liouville of order 0 < \alpha < 1.
