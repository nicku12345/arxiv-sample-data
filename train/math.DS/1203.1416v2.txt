Let M be a closed oriented C^\infty manifold and f a C^\infty Anosov diffeomorphism on M. We show that if M is the two torus T^2, then f is conjugate to a hyperbolic automorphism of T^2, either by a C^\infty diffeomorphism or by a singular homeomorphism. We also show that for general M, if f admits an absolutely continuous invariant measure \mu, then \mu is a C^\infty volume. The proofs are concatenations of well known results in the field.
