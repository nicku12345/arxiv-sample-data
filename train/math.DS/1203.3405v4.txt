Interval translation maps (ITMs) are a non-invertible generalization of interval exchange transformations (IETs). The dynamics of finite type ITMs is similar to IETs, while infinite type ITMs are known to exhibit new interesting effects. In this paper, we prove the finiteness conjecture for the ITMs of three intervals. Namely, the subset of ITMs of finite type contains an open, dense, and full Lebesgue measure subset of the space of ITMs of three intervals. For this, we show that any ITM of three intervals can be reduced either to a rotation or to a double rotation.
