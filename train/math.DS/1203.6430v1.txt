In paper [1] S. V. Tikhonov introduced a complete metric on the space of mixing transformations. It generates a topology called leash-topology. In [2] Tikhonov states the following problem: for what mixing transformation T its conjugacy class is dense in the space of mixing transformations with leash-topology? We show that it is true for every mixing T. As a corollary we get that generic mixing is rank-1.
