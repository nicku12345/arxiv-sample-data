On the set of genotypes \Phi=\{1,...,m\} we introduce a binary relation generated by Volterra quadratic stochastic operator V on (m-1) dimensional simplex S^{m-1} and prove that the operator V be non-ergodic if either there exists a Hamiltonian cycle or one of the vertices M_i=(\delta_{1i},\delta_{2i},...,\delta_{mi}) of the simplex S^{m-1} is a source and restriction of V to the invariant face F_i=\{x\in S^{m-1}: x_i=0\} is non-ergodic. In this paper we prove this result for m=2,3,4.
