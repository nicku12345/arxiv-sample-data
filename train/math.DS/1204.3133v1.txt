The Koch snowflake KS is a nowhere differentiable curve. The billiard table Omega(KS) with boundary KS is, a priori, not well defined. That is, one cannot a priori determine the minimal path traversed by a billiard ball subject to a collision in the boundary of the table. It is this problem which makes Omega(KS) such an interesting, yet difficult, table to analyze. In this paper, we approach this problem by approximating (from the inside) Omega(KS) by well-defined (prefractal) rational polygonal billiard tables Omega(KS_n). We first show that the flat surface S(KS_n) determined from the rational billiard Omega(KS_n) is a branched cover of the singly punctured hexagonal torus. Such a result, when combined with the results of [Gut2], allows us to define a sequence of compatible orbits of prefractal billiards. We define a hybrid orbit of a prefractal billiard Omega(KS_n) and show that every dense orbit of a prefractal billiard is a dense hybrid orbit of Omega(KS_n). This result is key in obtaining a topological dichotomy for a sequence of compatible orbits. Furthermore, we determine a sufficient condition for a sequence of compatible orbits to be a sequence of compatible periodic hybrid orbits. We then examine the limiting behavior of a sequence of compatible periodic hybrid orbits. We show that the trivial limit of particular (eventually) constant sequences of compatible hybrid orbits constitutes an orbit of Omega(KS). In addition, we show that the union of two suitably chosen nontrivial polygonal paths connects two elusive limit points of the Koch snowflake. Finally, we discuss how it may be possible for our results to be generalized to other fractal billiard tables and how understanding the structures of the Veech groups of the prefractal billiards may help in determining `fractal flat surfaces' naturally associated with the billiard flows.
