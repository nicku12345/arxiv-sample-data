We show that if M is a compact oriented surface of genus 0 and G is a subgroup of \Symp^\omega_\mu(M) which has an infinite normal solvable subgroup, then G is virtually abelian. In particular the centralizer of an infinite order f \in \Symp^\omega_\mu(M) is virtually abelian. Another immediate corollary is that if G is a solvable subgroup of \Symp^\omega_\mu(M) then G is virtually abelian. We also prove a special case of the Tits Alternative for subgroups of \Symp^\omega_\mu(S^2).
