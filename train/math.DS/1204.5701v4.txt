The main purpose of this paper is to prove the smooth local orbital linearization theorem for smooth vector fields which admit a complete set of first integrals near a nondegenerate singular point. The main tools used in the proof of this theorem are the formal orbital linearization theorem for formal integrable vector fields, the blowing-up method, and the Sternberg-Chen isomorphism theorem for formally-equivalent smooth hyperbolic vector fields.
