We give a new global presentation of our results on the asymptotic behavior of an iteration. This paper brings many improvements and corrections to our previous preprints on the subject. Among the applications, we use new methods to compute asymptotic results of PDE like Lorenz or Navier-Stokes equations. New questions as the resonance are studied.
