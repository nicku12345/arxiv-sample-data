The leafwise cohomology of the weak stable foliation of the geodesic flows is very important in the study of the space of actions whose orbit foliation is the weak stable foliation of geodesic flows.The dimension one cohomology was computed by S.Matsumoto and Y.Mitsumatsu in [MM].In this article we compute the second dimension cohomology completing the study of the cohomology of these foliations.
