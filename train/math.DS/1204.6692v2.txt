In this paper we construct an infinite sequence of binary irreducible polynomials starting from any irreducible polynomial f_0 \in \F_2 [x]. If f_0 is of degree n = 2^l \cdot m, where m is odd and l is a non-negative integer, after an initial finite sequence of polynomials f_0, f_1, ..., f_{s} with s \leq l+3, the degree of f_{i+1} is twice the degree of f_i for any i \geq s.
