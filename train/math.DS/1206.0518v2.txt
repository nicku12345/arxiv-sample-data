Let (X, T) be a topological dynamical system. Denote by h (T, K) and h^B (T, K) the covering entropy and dimensional entropy of K\subseteq X, respectively. (X, T) is called D-{\it lowerable} (resp. {\it lowerable}) if for each 0\le h\le h (T, X) there is a subset (resp. closed subset) K_h with h^B (T, K_h)= h (resp. h (T, K_h)= h); is called D-{\it hereditarily lowerable} (resp. {\it hereditarily lowerable}) if each Souslin subset (resp. closed subset) is D-lowerable (resp. lowerable).   In this paper it is proved that each topological dynamical system is not only lowerable but also D-lowerable, and each asymptotically h-expansive system is D-hereditarily lowerable. A minimal system which is lowerable and not hereditarily lowerable is demonstrated.
