We introduce a family of Banach spaces of measures, each containing the set of measures with density of bounded variation. These spaces are suitable for the study of weighted transfer operators of piecewise-smooth maps of the interval where the weighting used in the transfer operator is not better than piecewise H\"older continuous and the partition on which the map is continuous may possess a countable number of elements. For such weighted transfer operators we give upper bounds for both the spectral radius and for the essential spectral radius.
