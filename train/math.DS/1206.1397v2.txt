We study certain multiple ergodic averages of an iterated functions system generated by two contractions on the unit interval. By using the dynamical coding {0,1}^{\mathbb{N}} of the attractor, we compute the Hausdorff dimension of the set of points with a given frequency of the pattern 11 in positions k, 2k.
