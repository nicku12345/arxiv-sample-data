In this paper we compute the dimension of a class of dynamically defined non-conformal sets. Let X\subseteq\mathbb{T}^2 denote a Bedford-McMullen set and T:X\to X the natural expanding toral endomorphism which leaves X invariant. For an open set U\subset X we let X_U={x\in X : T^k(x)\not\in U \text{for all}k}. We investigate the box and Hausdorff dimensions of X_U for both a fixed Markov hole and also when U is a shrinking metric ball. We show that the box dimension is controlled by the escape rate of the measure of maximal entropy through U, while the Hausdorff dimension depends on the escape rate of the measure of maximal dimension.
