In this paper, we study asymptotic behavior arising in inverse limit spaces of dendrites. In particular, the inverse limit is constructed with a single unimodal bonding map, for which points have unique itineraries and the critical point is periodic. Using symbolic dynamics, sufficient conditions for two rays in the inverse limit space to have asymptotic parameterizations are given. Being a topological invariant, the classification of asymptotic parameterizations would be a useful tool when determining if two spaces are homeomorphic.
