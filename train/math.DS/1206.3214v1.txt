Let (X, T) be a topological dynamical system and let \Phi: X^r \to \mathbb{R} be a continuous function on the product space X^r= X\times ... \times X (r\ge 1). We are interested in the limit of V-statistics taking \Phi as kernel: [\lim_{n\to \infty} n^{-r}\sum_{1\le i_1, ..., i_r\le n} \Phi(T^{i_1}x, ..., T^{i_r} x).] The multifractal spectrum of topological entropy of the above limit is expressed by a variational principle when the system satisfies the specification property. Unlike the classical case (r=1) where the spectrum is an analytic function when \Phi is H\"{o}lder continuous, the spectrum of the limit of higher order V-statistics (r\ge 2) may be discontinuous even for very nice kernel \Phi.
