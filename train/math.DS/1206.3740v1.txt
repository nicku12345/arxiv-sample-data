This paper is concerned about the orbit equivalence types of C^\infty diffeomorphisms of S^1 seen as nonsingular automorphisms of (S^1,m), where m is the Lebesgue measure. Given any Liouville number \alpha, it is shown that each of the subspace formed by type {\rm II}_1, {\rm II}_\infty, {\rm III}_\lambda (\lambda>1), {\rm III}_\infty and {\rm III}_0 diffeomorphisms are C^\infty-dense in the space of the orientation preserving C^\infty diffeomorphisms with rotation number \alpha.
