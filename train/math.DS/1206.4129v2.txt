In the present paper, the wavelet transform of Fractal Interpolation Function (FIF) is studied. The wavelet transform of FIF is obtained through two different methods. The first method uses the functional equation through which FIF is constructed. By this method, it is shown that the FIF belongs to Lipschitz class of order \delta under certain conditions on free parameters. The second method is via Fourier transform of FIF. This approach gives the regularity of FIF under certain conditions on free parameters. Fourier transform of a FIF is also derived in this paper to facilitate the approach of wavelet transform of a FIF via Fourier transform.
