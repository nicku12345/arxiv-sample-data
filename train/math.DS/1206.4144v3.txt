Oscillator models are central to the study of system properties such as entrainment or synchronization. Due to their nonlinear nature, few system-theoretic tools exist to analyze those models. The paper develops a sensitivity analysis for phase-response curves, a fundamental one-dimensional phase reduction of oscillator models. The proposed theoretical and numerical analysis tools are illustrated on several system-theoretic questions and models arising in the biology of cellular rhythms.
