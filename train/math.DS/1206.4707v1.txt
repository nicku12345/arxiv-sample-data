We study the problem of existence of a periodic point in the boundary of an invariant domain for a surface homeomorphism. In the area-preserving setting, a complete classification is given in terms of rationality of Carath\'eordory's prime ends rotation number, similar to Poincar\'e's theory for circle homeomorphisms. In particular, we prove the converse of a classic result of Cartwright and Littlewood. This has a number of consequences for generic area preserving surface diffeomorphisms. For instance, we extend previous results of J. Mather on the boundary of invariant open sets for C^r-generic area preserving diffeomorphisms. Most results are proved in a general context, for homeomorphisms of arbitrary surfaces with a weak nonwandering-type hypothesis. This allows us to prove a conjecture of R. Walker about co-basin boundaries, and it also has applications in holomorphic dynamics.
