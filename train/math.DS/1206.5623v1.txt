We study particular solutions of the inner equation associated to the splitting of separatrices on generalized standard maps. An exponentially small complete expression for their difference is obtained. We also provide numerical evidence that the inner equation provides quantitative information of the splitting of separatrices even in the case when the limit flow does not.
