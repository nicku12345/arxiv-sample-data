Finite time coherent sets [8] have recently been defined by a measure based objective function describing the degree that sets hold together, along with a Frobenius-Perron transfer operator method to produce optimally coherent sets. Here we present an extension to generalize the concept to hierarchially defined relatively coherent sets based on adjusting the finite time coherent sets to use relative mesure restricted to sets which are developed iteratively and hierarchically in a tree of partitions. Several examples help clarify the meaning and expectation of the techniques, as they are the nonautonomous double gyre, the standard map, an idealized stratospheric flow, and empirical data from the Mexico Gulf during the 2010 oil spill. Also for sake of analysis of computational complexity, we include an appendic concerning the computational complexity of developing the Ulam-Galerkin matrix extimates of the Frobenius-Perron operator centrally used here.
