A prevailing trend in the stabilization of port-Hamiltonian systems is the assumption that the plant and the controller are both passive. In the standard approach of control by interconnection based on the generation of Casimir functions, this assumption leads to the dissipation obstacle, which essentially means that dissipation is admissible only on the coordinates of the closed-loop Hamiltonian that do not require shaping and thus severely restricts the scope of applications. In this contribution, we show that we can easily go beyond the dissipation obstacle by allowing the controller to have a negative semi-definite resistive structure, while guaranteeing stability of both the closed-loop and the controller.
