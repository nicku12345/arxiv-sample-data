In connection with Rokhlin's question on an automorphism with a homogeneous nonsimple spectrum, we indicate a class of measure-preserving maps T such that T\times T has a homogeneous spectrum of multiplicity 2. The automorphisms in question satisfy the condition \sigma\ast\sigma\perp \sigma, where \sigma is the spectral measure of T. We also show that there is a mixing automorphism possessing the above properties and their higher order analogs. This work has been published in the pilot issue of Selected Russian Mathematics, Vol.1 (1999), no.1, 13-24.
