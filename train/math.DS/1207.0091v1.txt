Let  X_{\beta} be a sofic  \beta -shift for  \beta \in (1, 2] . We show that there is an  S -gap shift  X(S)  such that  X_{\beta}  and  X(S)  are right-resolving almost conjugate. Conversely, a condition on  S \subseteq \mathbb N\cup \{0\}  is given such that for this S, there is a  \beta  such that  X(S)  and  X_{\beta}  have the same equivalency. We show that if X_\beta is SFT, then there is an S-gap shift conjugate to this X_\beta; however, if X_\beta is not SFT, then no S-gap shift is conjugate to X_\beta. Also we will investigate the existence of these sort of equivalencies for non-sofics.
