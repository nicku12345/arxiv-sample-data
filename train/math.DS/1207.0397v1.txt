In this paper we consider a non-smooth vector field Z=(X,Y), where X,Y are linear vector fields in dimension 3 and the discontinuity manifold \Sigma of Z is or the usual embedded torus or the unitary sphere at origin. We suppose that \Sigma is a sliding (stable/unstable) manifold with tangencies, by considering X,Y inelastic over \Sigma. In each case, we study the tangencies of the vector field Z with \Sigma and describe the behavior of the trajectories of the sliding vector field over \Sigma: they are basically closed.
