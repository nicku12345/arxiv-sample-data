We denote by \mathbb{M}^2_R a two dimensional space of constant positive Gaussian curvature. With methods of M\"obius geometry and using the classification of the M\"obius group of automorphisms {\rm \bf Mob}_2 \, (\hat{\mathbb{C}}) of the Riemman sphere \hat{\mathbb{C}}=\mathbb{M}_R^2 \cup \{\infty\}, we give algebraic conditions for the existence of M\"obius solutions on \hat{\mathbb{C}}, getting a complete classification of them. We show several families of this kind of solutions.
