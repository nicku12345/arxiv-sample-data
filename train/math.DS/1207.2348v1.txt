This memoir is concerned with the generic dynamical properties of conservative homeomorphisms of compact manifolds. Several important techniques allowing to prove genericity results are presented: we emphasize the important role played by periodic approximations of homeomorphisms, and by the embedding of the space of homeomorphisms in the space of bi-measurable automorphisms.
