In this article we show that the three-dimensional sphere admits {transitive} expansive flows in the sense of Komuro with hyperbolic equilibrium points. The result is based on a construction that allows us to see the geodesic flow of a hyperbolic three-punctured two-dimensional sphere as the flow of a smooth vector field on the three-dimensional sphere.
