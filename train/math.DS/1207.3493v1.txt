In this paper, we use permutation elements to record cylinder decompositions of a square-tiled surface X. Collecting all such possible permutation elements that record cylinder decompositions, we can enumerate the SL_2(\mathbb{Z}) orbit of a given surface X and give a method to determine whether or not a matrix A\in SL_2(\mathbb{Z}) is the differential of an affine diffeomorphism of X.
