Avila and Viana exhibit an explicit sufficient condition for the Lyapunov exponents of a linear cocycle over a Markov map to have multiplicity 1. Here, in terms of geometric perturbations, we prove that this sufficient criterion is generic in the space of all fiber bunched linear cocycles over Markov maps: the set of exceptional cocycles has infinite codimention, i.e. it is locally contained in finite unions of closed submanifolds with arbitrarily high codimension.
