We show that if (X,T) is an extension of an aperiodic subshift (a subsystem of ({1,2,...,l}^{\mathbb{Z}},\mathrm{shift}) for some l\in\mathbb{N}) and has mean dimension mdim(X,T)<\frac{D}{2} (D\in \mathbb{N}), then it embeds equivariantly in (([0,1]^{D})^{\mathbb{Z}},\mathrm{shift}). The result is sharp. If (X,T) is an extension of an aperiodic zero-dimensional system then it embeds equivariantly in (([0,1]^{D+1})^{\mathbb{Z}},\mathrm{shift}).
