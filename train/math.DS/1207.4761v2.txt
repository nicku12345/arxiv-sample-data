We study quadratic skew-products with parameters driven over piecewise expanding and Markov interval maps with countable many inverse branches, a generalization of the class of maps introduced by Viana. In particular we construct a class of multidimensional non-uniformly expanding attractors that exhibit both critical points and discontinuities and prove existence and uniqueness of an SRB measure with stretched-exponential decay of correlations, stretched-exponential large deviations and satisfying some limit laws. Moreover, generically such maps admit the coexistence of a dense subset of points with negative central Lyapunov exponent together with a full Lebesgue measure subset of points which have positive Lyapunov exponents in all directions. Finally, we discuss the existence of some non-uniformly hyperbolic attractors for skew-products associated to hyperbolic parameters.
