In this paper using Banach limit we have determined a Gibbs-like measure \mu_h supported by a cookie-cutter set E which is generated by a single cookie-cutter mapping f. For such a measure \mu_h and r\in (0, +\infty) we have shown that there exists a unique \kappa_r \in (0, +\infty) such that \kappa_r is the quantization dimension function of the probability measure \mu_h, and established its functional relationship with the temperature function of the thermodynamic formalism. The temperature function is commonly used to perform the multifractal analysis, in our context of the measure \mu_h. In addition, we have proved that the \kappa_r-dimensional lower quantization coefficient of order r of the probability measure is positive.
