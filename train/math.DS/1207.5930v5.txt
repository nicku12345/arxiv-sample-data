It is known that the dynamics of f and g vary to a large extent from that of its composite entire functions. Using Approximation theory of entire functions, we have shown the existence of entire functions f and g having infinite number of domains satisfying various properties and relating it to their composition. We have explored and enlarged all the maximum possible ways of the solution in comparison to the past result worked out.
