This paper is concerned with the local bifurcation analysis around typical singularities of piecewise smooth planar dynamical systems. Three-parameter families of a class of non-smooth vector fields are studied and the tridimensional bifurcation diagrams are exhibited. Our main results describe the unfolding of the so called fold-cusp singularity by means of the variation of 3 parameters.
