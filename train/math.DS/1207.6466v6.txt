In this paper, we study the action on C^n of any group G of holomorphic diffeomorphisms (automorphisms) of C^n fixing 0. Suppose that there is x in C^n, having an orbit which generates C^n and also E(x)=C^n, where E(x) is the vector space generated by L_{G}={D_{0}fx, f in G }. We give an important condition so that an orbit G(x) is isomorphic (by linear map) to the orbit L_{G}(x)of the linear group L_{G}. More if G is abelian, we prove the existence of a G-invariant open set U, dense in C^n, in which every orbit O is relatively minimal (i.e. the closure of O in U is a closed non empty, G-invariant set and has no proper subset with these properties). Moreover, if G has a dense orbit in C^n then every orbit of U is dense in C^n.
