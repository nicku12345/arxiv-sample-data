Teichm\"uller curves play an important role in the study of dynamics in polygonal billiards. In this article, we provide a criterion similar to the original M\"oller's criterion, to detect whether a complex curve, embedded in the moduli space of Riemann surfaces and endowed with a line subbundle of the Hodge bundle, is a Teichm\"uller curve, and give a dynamical proof of this criterion.
