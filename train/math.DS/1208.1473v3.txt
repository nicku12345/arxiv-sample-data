In this paper we consider C^{1+\epsilon} area-preserving diffeomorphisms of the torus f, either homotopic to the identity or to Dehn twists. We suppose that f has a lift \widetilde{f} to the plane such that its rotation set has interior and prove, among other things that if zero is an interior point of the rotation set, then there exists a hyperbolic \widetilde{f}-periodic point \widetilde{Q}\in {\rm I}\negthinspace {\rm R^2} such that W^u(\widetilde{Q}) intersects W^s(\widetilde{Q}+(a,b)) for all integers (a,b), which implies that \bar{W^u(\widetilde{Q})} is invariant under integer translations. Moreover, \bar{W^u(\widetilde{Q})}=\bar{W^s(\widetilde{Q})} and \widetilde{f} restricted to \bar{W^u(\widetilde{Q})} is invariant and topologically mixing. Each connected component of the complement of \bar{W^u(\widetilde{Q})} is a disk with uniformly bounded diameter. If f is transitive, then \bar{W^u(\widetilde{Q})}={\rm I}\negthinspace {\rm R^2} and \widetilde{f} is topologically mixing in the whole plane.
