We classify minimal sets of (closed and oriented) hyperbolic surface homeomorphisms by studying the connected components of their complement. This extends the classification given by F. Kwakkel, T.J\"ager and A. Passeggi in the torus. The given classification is studied in the non-wandering setting and in light of the Nielsen-Thurston Theory.
