Michael Handel proved in [7] the existence of a fixed point for an orientation preserving homeomorphism of the open unit disk that can be extended to the closed disk, provided that it has points whose orbits form an oriented cycle of links at infinity. Later, Patrice Le Calvez gave a different proof of this theorem based only on Brouwer theory and plane topology arguments [9]. These methods permitted to improve the result by proving the existence of a simple closed curve of index 1. We give a new, simpler proof of this improved version of the theorem and generalize it to non-oriented cycles of links at infinity
