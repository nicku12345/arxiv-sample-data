Parabolic bifurcations in one complex dimension demonstrate a wide variety of interesting dynamical phenomena. In this paper we consider parabolic bifurcations of families of diffeomorphisms in two complex dimensions. Specifically we consider a two variable family of diffeomorphisms F_\epsilon: M\to M given locally by F_\epsilon(x,y) = (x + x^2 + \epsilon^2+ ..., b_\epsilon y+...) where |b_\epsilon|<1, and the `...' terms involve x, y and \epsilon.
