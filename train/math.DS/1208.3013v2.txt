We consider the situation of a dominant meromorphic self-map f: X -rightarrow X, where X is a compact K\"ahler manifold of dimension n > 1. Suppose there is an embedded copy of \mathbb{P}^1 that is invariant under f, with f holomorphic and transversally superattracting with degree a in some neighborhood. Suppose f restricted to this line is given by z\mapsto z^b, with resulting invariant circle S. We prove that if a \geq b, then the local stable manifold W^s_\loc(S) is real analytic. In fact, we state and prove a suitable localized version that can be useful in wider contexts. We then show that the condition a \geq b cannot be relaxed without adding additional hypotheses by presenting two examples with a < b for which W^s_\loc(S) is not real analytic in the neighborhood of any point.
