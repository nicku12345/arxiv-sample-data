Let Diff^1(M) be the set of all C^1-diffeomorphisms f : M \rightarrow M, where M is a compact boundaryless d-dimensional manifold, d \geq 2. We prove that there is a residual subset R of Diff^1(M) such that if f \in R and if H(p) is the homoclinic class associated with a hyperbolic periodic point p, then either H(p) admits a dominated splitting of the form E\oplusF1 \oplus...\oplusFk \oplusG, where Fi is not hyperbolic and one-dimensional, or f|H(p) has no symbolic extensions.
