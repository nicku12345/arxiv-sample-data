For a continuous map f from the real line (half-open interval [0,1)) into itself let ent(f) denote the supremum of topological entropies of f|_K, where K runs over all compact f-invariant subsets of \mathbb{R} ([0,1), respectively). It is proved that if f is topologically transitive, then the best lower bound of ent(f) is \log\sqrt{3} (\log 3, respectively) and it is not attained. This solves a problem posed by C{\'a}novas [Dyn. Syst. \textbf{24} (2009), no. 4, 473--483].
