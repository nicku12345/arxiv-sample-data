For a finite alphabet \A and \eta\colon \Z\to\A, the Morse-Hedlund Theorem states that \eta is periodic if and only if there exists n\in\N such that the block complexity function P_\eta(n) satisfies P_\eta(n)\leq n, and this statement is naturally studied by analyzing the dynamics of a \Z-action associated to \eta. In dimension two, we analyze the subdynamics of a \ZZ-action associated to \eta\colon\ZZ\to\A and show that if there exist n,k\in\N such that the n\times k rectangular complexity P_{\eta}(n,k) satisfies P_{\eta}(n,k)\leq nk, then the periodicity of \eta is equivalent to a statement about the expansive subspaces of this action. As a corollary, we show that if there exist n,k\in\N such that P_{\eta}(n,k)\leq \frac{nk}{2}, then \eta is periodic. This proves a weak form of a conjecture of Nivat in the combinatorics of words.
