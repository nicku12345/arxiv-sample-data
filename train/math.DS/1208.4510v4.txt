We prove that a nilpotent subgroup of orientation preserving C^{1} diffeomorphisms of {\mathbb S}^{2} has a finite orbit of cardinality at most two. We also prove that a finitely generated nilpotent subgroup of orientation preserving C^{1} diffeomorphisms of {\mathbb R}^{2} preserving a compact set has a global fixed point. These results generalize theorems of Franks, Handel and Parwani for the abelian case.   We show that a nilpotent subgroup of orientation preserving C^{1} diffeomorphisms of {\mathbb S}^{2} that has a finite orbit of odd cardinality also has a global fixed point. Moreover we study the properties of the two-points orbits of nilpotent fixed-point-free subgroups of orientation preserving C^{1} diffeomorphisms of {\mathbb S}^{2}.
