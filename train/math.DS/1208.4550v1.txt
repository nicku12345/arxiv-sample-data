These expository notes are a somewhat embellished version of two rather informal evening review sessions given by the second author at the 2008 Bedlewo summer school on "Dynamical Systems - Geometric Structures and Rigidity"; they provide a brief overview of some of the basics of measure theory and its applications to dynamics which are foundational to the various courses at the school.
