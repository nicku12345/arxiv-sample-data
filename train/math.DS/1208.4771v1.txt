In this paper we consider the conjugacy classes of diffeomorphisms of the interval, endowed with the C^1-topology. We present several results in the spirit of the one below :   Given two diffeomorphisms f,g of the interval [0;1] without hyperbolic fixed point, we give a complete answer to the two following questions:   - under what conditions does there exist a sequence of smooth conjugates h_n f h_n^{-1} of f tending to g in the C^1-topology ?   - under what conditions does there exist a continuous path of C^1-diffeomorphisms h_t such that h_t f h_t^{-1} tends to g in the C^1 topology ?   We present also some consequences of these results as regards the study of the C^1-centralizers of C^1-contractions of [0;+\infty[ ; for instance we exhibit a C^1-contraction whose centralizer is uncountable and abelian, but is not a flow.
