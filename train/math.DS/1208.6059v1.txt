For ergodic measures we consider the return and entry times for a measure preserving transformation and its induced map on a positive measure subset. We then show that the limiting entry and return times distributions are the same for the induced maps as for the map on the entire system. The only assumptions needed are ergodicity and that the measures of the sets along which the limit is taken go to zero.
