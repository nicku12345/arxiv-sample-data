In this paper we continue the description of the possibilities to use numerical simulations for mathematically rigorous computer assisted analysis of integrability of dynamical systems. We sketch some of the algebraic methods of studying the integrability and present a constructive algorithm issued from the Ziglin's approach. We provide some examples of successful applications of the constructed algorithm to physical systems.
