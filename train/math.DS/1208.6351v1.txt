In this text matrix Volterra integral equation of the first kind is addressed. It is assumed that kernels of the equation have jump discontinuities on non-intersecting curves. Such equations appear in the theory of evolving dynamic systems. Differentiation of such equations with jump discontinue kernels yields the new class of the Volterra integral equations with functionally perturbed argument. The algorithm for construction of the logarithmic power asymptotics of the desired continuous solutions is proposed. The theorem of existance of the parametric families of solutions is proved. Finally the sufficient conditions for existence and uniqueness of continuous solution are derived.
