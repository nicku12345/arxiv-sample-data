In this paper, we introduce the notion of regular action of any abelian subgroup G of Diff^{1}(C^n) on C^n (i.e. the closure of every orbit of G in some open set is a topological sub-manifold of C^n). We prove that if G fixes 0 and dim(vect(L_{G}) =n, then the action of G, can not be p-chaotic for every 0<= p <=n-1. (i.e. If G has a dense orbit then the set of all regular orbit with order p can not be dense in C^{n}), where vect(L_{G}) is the vector space generated by all Df_{0}, f in G. Moreover, weprove that the action of any abelian lie subgroup of Diff^{1}(C^{n}), is regular.
