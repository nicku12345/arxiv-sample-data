In this paper we extend a method for iteratively improving slow manifolds so that it also can be used to approximate the fiber directions. The extended method is applied to general finite dimensional real analytic systems where we obtain exponential estimates of the tangent spaces to the fibers. The method is demonstrated on the Michaelis-Menten-Henri model and the Lindemann mechanism. The latter example also serves to demonstrate the method on a slow-fast system in non-standard slow-fast form. Finally, we extend the method further so that it also approximates the curvature of the fibers.
