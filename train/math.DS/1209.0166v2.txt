Let \mathcal{F}  be a pointwise almost periodic decomposition of a compact metrizable space X. Then \mathcal{F}  is R-closed if and only if \hat{\mathcal{F}}  is usc. Moreover, if there is a finite index normal subgroup H of an R-closed flow G on a compact manifold such that the orbit closures of H consist of codimension k compact connected elements and "few singularities" for k = 1 or 2, then the orbit class space of G is a compact k-dimensional manifold with conners. In addition, let v be a nontrivial R-closed vector field on a connected compact 3-manifold M. Then one of the following holds: 1) The orbit class space M/ \hat{v} is [0,1] or S^1 and each interior point of M/ \hat{v} is two dimensional. 2) \mathrm{Per}(v) is open dense and M = \mathrm{Sing}(v) \sqcup \mathrm{Per}(v). 3) There is a nontrivial non-toral minimal set. On the other hand, let G be a flow on a compact metrizable space and H a finite index normal subgroup. Then we show that G is R-closed if and only if so is H.
