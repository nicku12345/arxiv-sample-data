Let AC_D(M,SL(2,\mathbb R)) denote the pairs (f,A) so that f\in \mathcal A\subset \text{Diff}^{1}(M) is a C^{1}-Anosov transitive diffeomorphisms and A is an SL(2,\mathbb R) cocycle dominated with respect to f. We prove that open and densely in AC_D(M,SL(2,\mathbb R)) (in appropriate topologies) the pair (f,A) has simple spectrum with respect to the unique maximal entropy measure \mu_f. On the other hand, there exists a residual subset \mathcal{R}\subset \text{Aut}_{Leb}(M)\times L^\infty(M,SL(2,\mathbb R)), with respect to the separate topology, such that any element (f,A) in \mathcal{R} has trivial spectrum or it is hyperbolic. Then, we prove prevalence of trivial spectrum near the dynamical cocycle of an area-preserving map and also for generic cocycles in \text{Aut}_{Leb}(M)\times L^p(M,SL(2,\mathbb R)).
