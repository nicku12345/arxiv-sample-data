We introduce a family of polytope exchange transformations (PETs) acting on parallelotopes in \R^{2n} for n=1,2,3.... These PETs are constructed using a pair of lattices in \R^{2n}. The moduli space of these PETs is GL_n(\R). We study the case n=1 in detail. In this case, we show that the 2-dimensional family is completely renormalizable and that the (2,4,\infty) hyperbolic reflection triangle group acts (by linear fractional transformations) as the renormalization group on the moduli space. These results have a number of geometric corollaries for the system. Most of the paper is traditional mathematics, but some part of the paper relies on a rigorous computer-assisted proof involving integer calculations.
