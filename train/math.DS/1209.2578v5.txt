We consider partitioned graphs, by which we mean finite strongly connected directed graphs with a partitioned edge set  {\mathcal E} ={\mathcal E}^- \cup{\mathcal E}^+. With additionally given a relation \mathcal R between the edges in {\mathcal E}^- and the edges in \mathcal E^+ , and denoting the vertex set of the graph by {\frak P}, we speak of an an {\mathcal R}-graph {\mathcal G}_{\mathcal R}({\frak P},{\mathcal E}^-,{\mathcal E}^+) . From {\mathcal R}-graphs {\mathcal G}_{\mathcal R}({\frak P},{\mathcal E}^-,{\mathcal E}^+)  we construct semigroups (with zero) {\mathcal S}_{\mathcal R}({\frak P}, {\mathcal E}^-,{\mathcal E}^+)  that we call {\mathcal R}-graph semigroups. We describe a method of presenting subshifts by means of suitably structured labelled directed graphs ({\mathcal V}, \Sigma,\lambda) with vertex set {\mathcal V}, edge set \Sigma, and a label map that asigns to the edges in \Sigma labels in an {\mathcal R}-graph semigroup {\mathcal S}_{\mathcal R}({\frak P}, {\mathcal E}^-, {\mathcal E}^-). We call the presented subshift an {\mathcal S}_{\mathcal R}({\frak P}, {\mathcal E}^-, {\mathcal E}^-)-presentation.   We introduce a Property (B) and a Property (c), tof subshifts, and we introduce a notion of strong instantaneity. Under an assumption on the structure of the {\mathcal R}-graphs {\mathcal G}_{\mathcal R}({\frak P},{\mathcal E}^-, {\mathcal E}^-) we show for strongly instantaneous subshifts with Property (A) and associated semigroup {\mathcal S}_{\mathcal R}({\frak P},{\mathcal E}^-,{\mathcal E}^-), that Properties (B) and (c) are necessary and sufficient for the existence of an {\mathcal S}_{\mathcal R}({\frak P}, {\mathcal E}^-,{\mathcal E}^-)-presentation, to which the subshift is topologically conjugate,
