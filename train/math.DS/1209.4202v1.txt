This paper is devoted to problems stated by Z. Zhou and F. Li in 2009. They concern relations between almost periodic, weakly almost periodic, and quasi-weakly almost periodic points of a continuous map f and its topological entropy. The negative answer follows by our recent paper. But for continuous maps of the interval and other more general one-dimensional spaces we give more results; in some cases, the answer is positive.
