We present various properties of algebraic potentials, and then prove that some Morales-Ramis theorems readily apply for such potentials even if they are not in general meromorphic potentials. This allows in particular to precise some non-integrability proofs in celestial mechanics, where the mutual distances between the bodies appear in the potentials, and thus making this analysis unavoidable.
