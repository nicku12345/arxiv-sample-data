We prove that every self-homeomorphism h : K_s \to K_s on the inverse limit space K_s of the tent map T_s with slope s \in (\sqrt 2, 2] has topological entropy \htop(h) = |R| \log s, where R \in \Z is such that h and \sigma^R are isotopic. Conclusions on the possible values of the entropy of homeomorphisms of the inverse limit space of a (renormalizable) quadratic map are drawn as well.
