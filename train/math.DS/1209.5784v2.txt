For any C1 diffeomorphism with dominated splitting we consider a nonempty set of invariant measures which describes the asymptotic statistics of Lebesgue-almost all orbits. They are the limits of convergent subsequences of averages of the Dirac delta measures supported on those orbits. We prove that the metric entropy of each of these measures is bounded from below by the sum of the Lyapunov exponents on the dominating subbundle. As a consequence, if those exponents are non negative, and if the exponents on the dominated subbundle are non positive, those measures satisfy the Pesin Entropy Formula.
