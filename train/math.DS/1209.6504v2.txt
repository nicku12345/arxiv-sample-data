We consider the robust family of Geometric Lorenz attractors. These attractors are chaotic in the sense that they are transitive and have sensitive dependence on the initial conditions. Moreover, they support SRB measures whose ergodic basins cover a full Lebesgue measure subset of points in the topological basin of attraction. Here we prove that the SRB measures depend continuously on the dynamics in the weak^* topology.
