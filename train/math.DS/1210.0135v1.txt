For a continuous map f on a compact metric space we study the geometry and entropy of the generalized rotation set \R(\Phi). Here \Phi=(\phi_1,...,\phi_m) is a m-dimensional continuous potential and \R(\Phi) is the set of all \mu-integrals of \Phi and \mu runs over all f-invariant probability measures. It is easy to see that the rotation set is a compact and convex subset of \bR^m. We study the question if every compact and convex set is attained as a rotation set of a particular set of potentials within a particular class of dynamical systems. We give a positive answer in the case of subshifts of finite type by constructing for every compact and convex set K in \bR^m a potential \Phi=\Phi(K) with \R(\Phi)=K. Next, we study the relation between \R(\Phi) and the set of all statistical limits \R_{Pt}(\Phi). We show that in general these sets differ but also provide criteria that guarantee \R(\Phi)= \R_{Pt}(\Phi). Finally, we study the entropy function w\mapsto H(w), w\in \R(\Phi). We establish a variational principle for the entropy function and show that for certain non-uniformly hyperbolic systems H(w) is determined by the growth rate of those hyperbolic periodic orbits whose \Phi-integrals are close to w. We also show that for systems with strong thermodynamic properties (subshifts of finite type, hyperbolic systems and expansive homeomorphisms with specification, etc.) the entropy function w\mapsto H(w) is real-analytic in the interior of the rotation set.
