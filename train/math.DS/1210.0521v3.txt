There is a wealth of results in the literature on the thermodynamic formalism for potentials that are, in some sense, "hyperbolic". We show that for a sufficiently regular one-dimensional map satisfying a weak hyperbolicity assumption, every Holder continuous potential is hyperbolic. A sample consequence is the absence of phase transitions: The pressure function is real analytic on the space of Holder continuous functions. Another consequence is that every Holder continuous potential has a unique equilibrium state, and that this measure has exponential decay of correlations.
