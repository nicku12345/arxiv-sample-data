We develop the theory of compound functional differential equations, which are tensor and exterior products of linear functional differential equations. Of particular interest is the equation \dot x(t)=-\alpha(t)x(t)-\beta(t)x(t-1) with a single delay, where the delay coefficient is of one sign, say \delta\beta(t)\ge 0 with \delta\in{-1,1}. Positivity properties are studied, with the result that if (-1)^k=\delta then the k-fold exterior product of the above system generates a linear process which is positive with respect to a certain cone in the phase space. Additionally, if the coefficients \alpha(t) and \beta(t) are periodic of the same period, and \beta(t) satisfies a uniform sign condition, then there is an infinite set of Floquet multipliers which are complete with respect to an associated lap number. Finally, the concept of u_0-positivity of the exterior product is investigated when \beta(t) satisfies a uniform sign condition.
