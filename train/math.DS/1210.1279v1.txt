We study hyperbolized versions of cohomological equations that appear with cocycles by isometries of the euclidean space. These (hyperbolized versions of) equations have a unique continuous solution. We concentrate in to know whether or not these solutions converge to a genuine solution to the original equation, and in what sense we can use them as good approximative solutions. The main advantage of considering solutions to hyperbolized cohomological equations is that they can be easily described, since they are global attractors of a naturally defined skew-product dynamics. We also include some technical results about twisted Birkhoff sums and exponential averaging.
