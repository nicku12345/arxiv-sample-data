We give explicit pseudo-Anosov homeomorphisms with vanishing Sah-Arnoux-Fathi invariant. Any translation surface whose Veech group is commensurable to any of a large class of triangle groups is shown to have an affine pseudo-Anosov homeomorphism of this type. We also apply a reduction to finite triangle groups and thereby show the existence of non-parabolic elements in the periodic field of certain translation surfaces.
