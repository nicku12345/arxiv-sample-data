We show that an exponential map f_c(z)=e^z+c whose singular value c is combinatorially non-recurrent and non-escaping is uniquely determined by its combinatorics, i.e. the pattern in which its dynamic rays land together. We do this by constructing puzzles and parapuzzles in the exponential family. We also prove a theorem about hyperbolicity of the postsingular set in the case that the singular value is non-recurrent. Finally, we show that boundedness of the postsingular set implies combinatorial non-recurrence if c is in the Julia set.
