Uniform exponential (UE) stability of linear difference equations with infinite delay is studied using the notions of a stability radius and a phase space. The state space \X is supposed to be an abstract Banach space. We work both with non-fading phase spaces c_0 (\ZZ^-, \X) and \ll^\infty (\ZZ^-, \X) and with exponentially fading phase spaces of the \ll^p and c_0 types. For equations of the convolution type, several criteria of UE stability are obtained in terms of the Z-transform \wh K (\zeta) of the convolution kernel K (\cdot), in terms of the input-state operator and of the resolvent (fundamental) matrix. These criteria do not impose additional positivity or compactness assumptions on coefficients K(j). Time-varying (non-convolution) difference equations are studied via structured UE stability radii \r_\t of convolution equations. These radii correspond to a feedback scheme with delayed output and time-varying disturbances. We also consider stability radii \r_\c associated with a time-invariant disturbance operator, unstructured stability radii, and stability radii corresponding to delayed feedback. For all these types of stability radii two-sided estimates are obtained. The estimates from above are given in terms of the Z-transform \wh K (\zeta), the estimate from below via the norm of the input-output operator. These estimates turn into explicit formulae if the state space \X is Hilbert or if disturbances are time-invariant. The results on stability radii are applied to obtain various exponential stability tests for non-convolution equations. Several examples are provided.
