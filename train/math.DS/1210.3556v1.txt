We give a complete description of the behaviour of the sequence of displacements \eta_n(z)=\Phi^n(x) - \Phi^{n-1}(x) \ \rmod \ 1, z=\exp(2\pi \rmi x), along a trajectory \{\varphi^{n}(z)\}, where \varphi is an orientation preserving circle homeomorphism and \Phi:\mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R} its lift. If the rotation number \varrho(\varphi)=\frac{p}{q} is rational then \eta_n(z) is asymptotically periodic with semi-period q. This convergence to a periodic sequence is uniform in z if we admit that some points are iterated backward instead of taking only forward iterations for all z. If \varrho(\varphi) \notin \mathbb{Q} then the values of \eta_n(z) are dense in a set which depends on the map \gamma (semi-)conjugating \varphi with the rotation by \varrho(\varphi) and which is the support of the displacements distribution. We provide an effective formula for the displacement distribution if \varphi is C^1-diffeomorphism and show approximation of the displacement distribution by sample displacements measured along a trajectory of any other circle homeomorphism which is sufficiently close to the initial homeomorphism \varphi. Finally, we prove that even for the irrational rotation number \varrho the displacement sequence exhibits some regularity properties.
