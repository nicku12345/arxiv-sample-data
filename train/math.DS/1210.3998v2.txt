We study the ordinary differential equation \varepsilon\ddot x + \dot x + \varepsilon g(x) = \e f(\omega t), where g and f are real-analytic functions, with f quasi-periodic in t with frequency vector \omega. If c_{0} \in \mathbb{R} is such that g(c_0) equals the average of f and g'(c_0)\neq0, under very mild assumptions on \omega there exists a quasi-periodic solution close to c_0. We show that such a solution depends analytically on \varepsilon in a domain of the complex plane tangent more than quadratically to the imaginary axis at the origin.
