A partially hyperbolic diffeomorphism f is structurally quasi-stable if for any diffeomorphism g C^1-close to f, there is a homeomorphism \pi of M such that \pi\circ g and f\circ\pi differ only by a motion \tau along center directions. f is topologically quasi-stable if for any homeomorphism g C^0-close to f, the above holds for a continuous map \pi instead of a homeomorphism. We show that any partially hyperbolic diffeomorphism f is topologically quasi-stable, and if f has C^1 center foliation W^c_f, then f is structurally quasi-stable. As applications we obtain continuity of topological entropy for certain partially hyperbolic diffeomorphisms with one or two dimensional center foliation.
