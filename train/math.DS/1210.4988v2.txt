A partially hyperbolic diffeomorphism f has quasi-shadowing property if for any pseudo orbit {x_k}_{k\in \mathbb{Z}}, there is a sequence of points {y_k}_{k\in \mathbb{Z}} tracing it in which y_{k+1} is obtained from f(y_k) by a motion \tau along the center direction. We show that any partially hyperbolic diffeomorphism has quasi-shadowing property, and if f has C^1 center foliation then we can require \tau to move the points along the center foliation. As applications, we show that any partially hyperbolic diffeomorphism is topologically quasi-stable under C^0-perturbation. When f has uniformly compact C^1 center foliation, we also give partially hyperbolic diffeomorphism versions of some theorems holden for uniformly hyperbolic systems, such as Anosov closing lemma, cloud lemma and spectral decomposition theorem.
