Rudolph showed that the orbits of any measurable, measure preserving \mathbb R^d action can be measurably tiled by 2^d rectangles and asked if this number of tiles is optimal for d>1. In this paper, using a tiling of \mathbb R^d by notched cubes, we show that d+1 tiles suffice. Furthermore, using a detailed analysis of the set of invariant measures on tilings of \mathbb R^2 by two rectangles, we show that while for \mathbb R^2 actions with completely positive entropy this bound is optimal there exist mixing \mathbb R^2 actions whose orbits can be tiled by 2 tiles.
