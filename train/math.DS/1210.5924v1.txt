Stochastic invariant manifolds are crucial in modelling the dynamical behavior of dynamical systems under uncertainty. Under the assumption of exponential trichotomy, existence and smoothness of center manifolds for a class of stochastic evolution equations with linearly multiplicative noise are proved. The exponential attraction and approximation to center manifolds are also discussed.
