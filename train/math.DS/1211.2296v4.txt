An asymmetric-RLL(d_1,k_1,d_0,k_0) system is a subshift of \{0,1\}^{\mathbb Z} with run of  1  and  0 restricted to S=[d_1,k_1]\subseteq\mathbb N_{0}=\mathbb N\cup\{0\} and S'=[d_0,k_0]\subseteq\mathbb N_{0} respectively. We extend this concept to the case when S and S' are arbitrary subsets of \mathbb N_{0} and we call it a (S,S')-gap shift. Moreover, for i=1,2, if X_{i} is a synchronized system generated by V_{i}=\{v^{i}\alpha_{i}:\alpha_i v^{i}\alpha_i\in\mathcal B(X_i),\alpha_i\not\subseteq v^{i}\} where  \alpha_i  is a synchronizing word for  X_i , then a natural generalization of (S,S')-gap shifts is a coded system Z generated by \{v^{1}\alpha_1 v^{2}\alpha_2:v^{i}\alpha_i\in V_{i}, i=1,2\} and called the intertwined system. We investigate the dynamical properties of Z with respect to X_1 and X_2.
