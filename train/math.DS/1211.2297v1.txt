In ergodic theory, two systems are Kakutani equivalent if there exists a conjugacy between induced transformations. In Measured Topological Orbit and Kakutani Equivalence, del Junco, Rudolph, and Weiss defined nearly continuous even Kakutani equivalence as an orbit equivalence which restricts to a conjugacy between induced maps on nearly clopen sets. This paper defines nearly continuous even Kakutani equivalence between two nearly continuous dynamical systems as a nearly continuous conjugacy between induced maps on nearly clopen sets of the same size and shows that this definition is equivalent to the definition given by del Junco, Rudolph, and Weiss. The paper shows that, with an added restriction, if two systems are nearly continuously (non-even) Kakutani equivalent, then one system is isomorphic to an induced transformation of the other, and uses this result to prove that a class of transformations called strongly rank one and containing Chacon's map belongs to the same nearly continuous even Kakutani equivalence class as irrational rotations.
