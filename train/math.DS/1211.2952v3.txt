We study random perturbations of multidimensional piecewise expanding maps. We characterize absolutely continuous stationary measures (acsm) of randomly perturbed dynamical systems in terms of pseudo-orbits linking the ergodic components of absolutely invariant measures (acim) of the unperturbed system. We focus on those components, called least-elements, which attract pseudo-orbits. We show that each least element admits a neighbourhood which supports exactly one ergodic acsm of the random system. We use this result to identify random perturbations that exhibit a metastable behavior.
