We discuss rescaling limits for sequences of complex rational maps in one variable which approach infinity in parameter space.It is shown that any given sequence of maps of degree d \ge 2 has at most 2d-2 dynamically distinct rescaling limits which are not postcritically finite. For quadratic rational maps, a complete description of the possible rescaling limits is given. These results are obtained employing tools from non-Archimedean dynamics.
