We discuss when two rational functions f and g can have the same measure of maximal entropy. The polynomial case was completed by (Beardon, Levin, Baker-Eremenko,Schmidt-Steinmetz, etc., 1980s-90s), and we address the rational case following Levin-Przytycki (1997). We show: \mu_f = \mu_g implies that f and g share an iterate (f^n = g^m for some n and m) for general f with degree d \geq 3. And for generic f\in \Rat_{d\geq 3}, \mu_f = \mu_g implies g=f^n for some n \geq 1. For generic f\in \Rat_2, \mu_f = \mu_g implies that g= f^n or \sigma_f\circ f^n for some n\geq 1, where \sigma_f\in PSL_2(\C) permutes two points in each fiber of f. Finally, we construct examples of f and g with \mu_f = \mu_g such that f^n \neq \sigma\circ g^m for any \sigma \in PSL_2(\C) and m,n\geq 1.
