In this paper we study the family of \alpha-Farey-Minkowski functions \theta_\alpha, for an arbitrary countable partition \alpha of the unit interval with atoms which accumulate only at the origin, which are the conjugating homeomorphisms between each of the \alpha-Farey systems and the tent map. We first show that each function \theta_\alpha is singular with respect to the Lebesgue measure and then demonstrate that the unit interval can be written as the disjoint union of the following three sets: \Theta_0:={x\in\U:\theta_\alpha'(x)=0}, \Theta_\infty:={x\in\U:\theta_\alpha'(x)=\infty} and \Theta_\sim:=\U\setminus(\Theta_0\cup\Theta_\infty). The main result is that [\dim_{\mathrm{H}}(\Theta_\infty)=\dim_{\mathrm{H}}(\Theta_\sim)=\sigma_\alpha(\log2)<\dim_{\mathrm{H}}(\Theta_0)=1,] where \sigma_\alpha(\log2) is the Hausdorff dimension of the level set {x\in \U:\Lambda(F_\alpha, x)=s}, where \Lambda(F_\alpha, x) is the Lyapunov exponent of the map F_\alpha at the point x. The proof of the theorem employs the multifractal formalism for \alpha-Farey systems.
