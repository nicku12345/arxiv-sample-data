We describe the behaviour at infinity of the bifurcation current in the moduli space of quadratic rational maps. To this purpose, we extend it to some closed, positive (1, 1)-current on a two-dimensional complex projective space and then compute the Lelong numbers and the self-intersection of the extended current.
