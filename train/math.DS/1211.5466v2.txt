The theory of substitution sequences and their higher-dimensional analogues is intimately connected with symbolic dynamics. By systematically studying the factors (in the sense of dynamical systems theory) of a substitution dynamical system, one can reach a better understanding of spectral and topological properties. We illustrate this point of view by means of some characteristic examples, including a rather universal substitution in one dimension as well as the squiral and the table tilings of the plane.
