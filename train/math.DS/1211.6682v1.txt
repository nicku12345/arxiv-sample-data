We prove that a "positive probability" subset of the boundary of the set of hyperbolic (Axiom A) surface diffeomorphisms with no cycles \mathcal{H} is constituted by Kupka-Smale diffeomorphisms: all periodic points are hyperbolic and their invariant manifolds intersect transversally. Lack of hyperbolicity arises from the presence of a tangency between a stable manifold and an unstable manifold, one of which is not associated to a periodic point. All these diffeomorphisms that we construct lie on the boundary of the same connected component of \mathcal{H}.
