The first half of this paper is concerned with the topology of the space \AAA(M) of (not necessarily contact) Anosov vector fields on the unit tangent bundle M of closed oriented hyperbolic surfaces \Sigma. We show that there are countably infinite connected components of \AAA(M), each of which is not simply connected. In the second part, we study contact Anosov flows. We show in particular that the time changes of contact Anosov flows form a C^1-open subset of the space of the Anosov flows which leave a particular C^\infty volume form invariant, if the ambiant manifold is a rational homology sphere.
