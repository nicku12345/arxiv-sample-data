We prove that a hypothesis of Cassels, Swinnerton-Dyer, recast by Margulis as statement on the action of the diagonal group A on the space of unimodular lattices, is equivalent to several assertions about minimal sets for this action. More generally, for a maximal \mathbb{R}-diagonalizable subgroup A of a reductive group G and a lattice \Gamma in G, we give a sufficient condition for a compact A-minimal subset Y of G/\Gamma to be of a simple form, which is also necessary if G is \mathbb{R}-split. We also show that the stabilizer of Y has no nontrivial connected unipotent subgroups.
