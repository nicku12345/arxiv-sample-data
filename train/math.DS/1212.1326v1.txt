We study the problem of Arnold's diffusion in an example of isochronous system by using a geometrical method known as Windows Method. Despite the simple features of this example, we show that the absence of an anisochrony term leads to several substantial difficulties in the application of the method, requiring some additional devices as non-equally spaced transition chains and variable windows. In this way we are able to obtain a set of fast orbits whose drifting time matches, up to a constant, the time obtained via variational methods.
