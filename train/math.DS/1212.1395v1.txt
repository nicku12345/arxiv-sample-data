We develop the connection of Berg partitions with special substitution tilings of two tiles. We obtain a new proof that the number of Berg partitions with a fixed connectivity matrix is equal to half of the sum of its entries, \cite{S-W}.   This approach together with the formula of S\'{e}\'{e}bold \cite{Seb}, for the number of substitutions preserving a given Sturmian sequence, shows that all of the combinatorial substitutions can be realized geometrically as Berg partitions.   We treat Sturmian tilings as intersection tilings of bi-partitions. Using the symmetries of bi-partitions we obtain geometrically the palindromic properties of Sturmian sequences (Theorem 3) established combinatorially by de Luca and Mignosi, \cite{L-M}.
