We define the notion of \varepsilon-flexible periodic point: it is a periodic point with stable index equal to two whose dynamics restricted to the stable direction admits \varepsilon-perturbations both to a homothety and a saddle having an eigenvalue equal to one. We show that \varepsilon-perturbation to an \varepsilon-flexible point allows to change it in a stable index one periodic point whose (one dimensional) stable manifold is an arbitrarily chosen C^1 -curve. We also show that the existence of flexible point is a general phenomenon among systems with a robustly non-hyperbolic two dimensional center-stable bundle.
