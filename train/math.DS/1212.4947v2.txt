Definition of generalized normal form for a system of ODEs corresponding to an infinitesimal symplectic or contact transformation near a singular point, with an arbitrary polynomial unperturbed part, and a method of its finding are introduced. Applicability of the introduced method to studying the critical phenomena in non-ideal media is shown. As examples, generalized normal forms for the equations of state of a mixture of non-ideal gases and non-ideal multicomponent plasma are considered within the framework of perturbation theory. In particular, it is shown that the lowest order perturbation effects in the Debye-H\"uckel hydrogen plasmas are classified by only three constant parameters.
