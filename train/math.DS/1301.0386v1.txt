In this paper, we study "demi-caract\'eristique" and (Poisson) stability in the sense of Poincar\'e. Using the definitions \'a la Poincar\'e for \R-actions v on compact connected surfaces, we show that "R-closed" \Rightarrow "pointwise almost periodicity (p.a.p.)" \Rightarrow "recurrence" \Rightarrow non-wandering. Moreover, we show that the action v is "recurrence" with |\mathrm{Sing}(v)| < \infty iff v is regular non-wandering. If there are no locally dense orbits, then v is "p.a.p." iff v is "recurrence" without "orbits" containing infinitely singularities. If |\mathrm{Sing}(v)| < \infty, then v is "R-closed" iff v is "p.a.p.".
