A technique is presented for multiplexing two ergodic measure preserving transformations together to derive a third limiting transformation. This technique is used to settle a question regarding rigidity of weak mixing transformations. Namely, given any rigidity sequence for an ergodic measure preserving transformation, there exists a weak mixing transformation which is rigid along the same sequence. This establishes a wide range of rigidity sequences for weakly mixing dynamical systems.
