We consider a perturbed KdV equation:   [\dot{u}+u_{xxx} - 6uu_x = \epsilon f(x,u(\cdot)), \quad x\in \mathbb{T}, \quad\int_\mathbb{T} u dx=0.]   For any periodic function u(x), let I(u)=(I_1(u),I_2(u),...)\in\mathbb{R}_+^{\infty} be the vector, formed by the KdV integrals of motion, calculated for the potential u(x). Assuming that the perturbation \epsilon f(x,u(\cdot)) is a smoothing mapping (e.g. it is a smooth function \epsilon f(x), independent from u), and that solutions of the perturbed equation satisfy some mild a-priori assumptions, we prove that for solutions u(t,x) with typical initial data and for 0\leqslant t\lesssim \epsilon^{-1}, the vector I(u(t)) may be well approximated by a solution of the averaged equation.
