In connection with some recent results by J. Bourgain and H. Abdalaoui, M. Lemanczyk, T. De La Rue (ALR) we present a short proof of Bourgain's theorem on Mobius orthogonality property for bounded rank-one constructions. The proof of the fact (due to ALR) that bounded-recurrent constructions with Markov self-similarity have to be flat-recurrent is simplified as well.(v4 in Russian)
