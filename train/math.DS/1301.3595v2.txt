We consider the distribution of the orbits of the number 1 under the \beta-transformations T_\beta as \beta varies. Mainly, the size of the set of \beta>1 for which a given point can be well approximated by the orbit of 1 is measured by its Hausdorff dimension. That is, the dimension of the following set  E\big({\ell_n}_{n\ge 1}, x_0\big)=\Big{\beta>1: |T^n_{\beta}1-x_0|<\beta^{-\ell_n}, {for infinitely many} n\in \N\Big}  is determined, where x_0 is a given point in [0,1] and {\ell_n}_{n\ge 1} is a sequence of integers tending to infinity as n\to \infty. For the proof of this result, the notion of the recurrence time of a word in symbolic space is introduced to characterize the lengths and the distribution of cylinders (the set of \beta with a common prefix in the expansion of 1) in the parameter space {\beta\in \R: \beta>1}.
