The local topological dynamics of subgroups of {\rm Diff} ({\mathbb C^n}, 0), with special emphasis on {\rm Diff} ({\mathbb C^2}, 0), is discussed with a view towards integrability questions. It is proved in particular that a subgroup of {\rm Diff} ({\mathbb C^2}, 0) possessing locally finite orbits is necessarily solvable. Other results and examples related to higher-dimensional generalizations of Mattei-Moussu's celebrated topological characterization of integrability are also provided. These examples also settle a fundamental question raised by the previous work of Camara-Scardua.
