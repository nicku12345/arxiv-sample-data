We define a normal form (called the canonical image) of an arbitrary measurable function of several variables with respect to a natural group of transformations; describe a new complete system of invariants of such a function (the system of joint distributions); and relate these notions to the matrix distribution, another invariant of measurable functions found earlier, which is a random matrix.
