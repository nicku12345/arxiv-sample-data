In this paper, we are concerned with the boundedness of all the solutions for a kind of second order differential equations with p-Laplacian term (\phi_p(x'))'+a\phi_p(x^+)-b\phi_p(x^-)+f(x)=e(t), where x^+=\max (x,0), x^- =\max(-x,0), \phi_p(s)=|s|^{p-2}s, p\geq2, a and b are positive constants (a\not=b), and satisfy \frac{1}{a^{\frac{1}{p}}}+\frac{1}{b^{\frac{1}{p}}}=2\omega^{-1} ,where \omega \in \RR^+ \backslash \QQ, the perturbation f is unbounded, e(t)\in {\cal C}^{6} is is a smooth 2\pi_p-periodic function on t, where \pi_p=\frac{2\pi(p-1)^{\frac{1}{p}}}{p\sin\frac{\pi}{p}}.
