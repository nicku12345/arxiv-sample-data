The following observation must surely be "well-known", but it seems worth giving a simple and quite explicit proof. Take any finite subset X of Rn, n>1. Then, there is a polynomial function P:Rn -> R which has local minima on the set X, and has no other critical points. Applied to the negative gradient flow of P, this implies that there is a polynomial vector field with asymptotically stable equilibria on X and no other equilibria. Some trajectories of this vector field are not pre-compact; a complementary observation says that, again for arbitrary X, one can find a vector field with asymptotically stable equilibria on X, no other equilibria except saddles, and all omega-limit sets consisting of singletons.
