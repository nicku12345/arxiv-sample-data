In this paper we address the issues of absolute continuity for the center foliation (as well as the disintegration on the non-absolute continuous case) and rigidity of volume preserving partially hyperbolic diffeomorphisms isotopic to a linear Anosov on \mathbb T^3. It is shown that the disintegration of volume on center leaves may be neither atomic nor Lebesgue. It is also obtained results concerning the atomic disintegration. Moreover, the absolute continuity of the center foliation does not imply smooth conjugacy with its linearization. Imposing stronger conditions besides absolute continuity on the center foliation, smooth conjugacy is obtained.
