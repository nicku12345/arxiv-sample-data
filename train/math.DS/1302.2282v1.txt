Let f: M \to M be a diffeomorphism defined on a compact boundaryless d-dimensional manifold M, d\geq 2. C. Morales has proposed the notion of measure expansiveness. In this note we show that diffeomorphisms in a residual subset far from homoclinic tangencies are measure expansive.   We also show that surface diffeomorphisms presenting homoclinic tangencies can be C^1-approximated by non-measure expansive diffeomorphisms.
