Let 0<a<b<1 and let T be the doubling map. Set \mathcal J(a,b):=\{x\in[0,1] : T^nx\notin (a,b), n\ge0\}. In this paper we completely characterize the holes (a,b) for which any of the following scenarios holds: {enumerate} \mathcal J(a,b) contains a point x\in(0,1); \mathcal J(a,b)\cap [\de,1-\de] is infinite for any fixed \de>0; \mathcal J(a,b) is uncountable of zero Hausdorff dimension; \mathcal J(a,b) is of positive Hausdorff dimension. {enumerate} In particular, we show that (iv) is always the case if \[ b-a<\frac14\prod_{n=1}^\infty \bigl(1-2^{-2^n}\bigr)\approx 0.175092 \] and that this bound is sharp. As a corollary, we give a full description of first and second order critical holes introduced in \cite{SSC} for the doubling map.   Furthermore, we show that our model yields a continuum of "routes to chaos" via arbitrary sequences of products of natural numbers, thus generalizing the standard route to chaos via period doubling.
