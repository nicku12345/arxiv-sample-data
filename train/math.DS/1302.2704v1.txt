Let \{U_t \}_{t \in {\mathbb D}} be a family of topological disks on the Riemann sphere containing the origin 0 whose boundaries undergo a holomorphic motion over the unit disk \mathbb D. We study the question of when there exists a family of Riemann maps g_t:({\mathbb D},0) \to (U_t,0) which depends holomorphically on the parameter t. We give five equivalent conditions which provide analytic, dynamical and measure-theoretic characterizations for the existence of the family \{g_t \}_{t \in {\mathbb D}}, and explore the consequences.
