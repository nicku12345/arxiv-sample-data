By using a cocycle generated by the step function \varphi_{\beta, \gamma} = 1_{[0, \beta]} - 1_{[0, \beta]} (. + \gamma) over an irrational rotation x \to x + \alpha \mod 1, we present examples which illustrate different aspects of the general theory of cylinder maps. In particular, we construct non ergodic cocycles with ergodic compact quotients, cocycles generating an extension T_{\alpha, \varphi} with a small centralizer. The constructions are related to diophantine properties of \alpha, \beta, \gamma.
