In this article we intend to contribute in the understanding of the ergodic properties of the set RT of robustly transitive local diffeomorphisms on a compact manifold M without boundary. We prove that there exists a C^1 residual subset R_0 of RT such that any f in R_0 has a residual subset of M with dense pre-orbits. Moreover, C^1 generically in the space of local diffeomorphisms with no splitting and all points with dense pre-orbit, there are uncountably many ergodic expanding invariant measures with full support and exhibiting exponential decay of correlations. In particular, these results hold for an important class of robustly transitive maps considered in [Lizana-Pujals'12].
