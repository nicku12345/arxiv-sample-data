We introduce a new analytical method, which allows to find out chaotic dynamics in non-smooth dynamical systems. A simple mechanical system consisting of a mass and a dry friction element is considered as an example. The corresponding mathematical model is represented. We show that the considered dynamical system is a skew product over a piecewise smooth mapping of a segment (a base map). For this base map we demonstrate there is a domain of parameters where a robust chaotic dynamics can be observed. Namely, we prove existence of an infinite set of periodic points of arbitrarily big period. Moreover, a reduction of the considered map is semi-conjugated to a shift on the set of one-sided infinite boolean sequences. Also, we find conditions, sufficient for existence of a superstable periodic point of this map. The obtained result partially solves a general problem: theoretical confirmation of chaotic and periodic regimes numerically and experimentally observed for models of percussion drilling.
