We consider an orientation preserving homeomorphism h of S^2 which admits a repellor denoted \infty and an attractor -\infty, which is not a North-South map, such that the basins of \infty and -\infty intersect. We study various aspects of the rotation number of h:S^2\setminus\{\pm\infty\}\to S^2\setminus\{\pm\infty\}, especially its relationship with the existence of periodic orbits.
