Let M be a translation surface. We show that certain deformations of M supported on the set of all cylinders in a given direction remain in the GL(2,R)-orbit closure of M. Applications are given concerning complete periodicity, field of definition, and the number of of parallel cylinders which may be found on a translation surface in a given orbit closure.   The proof uses Eskin-Mirzakhani-Mohammadi's recent theorem on orbit closures of translation surfaces, as well as results of Minsky-Weiss and Smillie-Weiss on the dynamics of horocycle flow.
