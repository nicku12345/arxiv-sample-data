Let (M, \Omega) be a smooth symplectic manifold and f:M\rightarrow M be a symplectic diffeomorphism of class C^l (l\geq 3). Let N be a compact submanifold of M which is boundaryless and normally hyperbolic for f. We suppose that N is controllable and that its stable and unstable bundles are trivial. We consider a C^1-submanifold \d of M whose dimension is equal to the dimension of a fiber of the unstable bundle of T_NM. We suppose that \d transversely intersects the stable manifold of N. Then, we prove that for all \varepsilon>0, and for n \in \N large enough, there exists x_n \in N such that f^n(\d) is \varepsilon-close, in the C^1 topology, to the strongly unstable manifold of x_n.   As an application of this \lambda-lemma, we prove the existence of shadowing orbits for a finite family of invariant minimal sets (for which we do not assume any regularity) contained in a normally hyperbolic manifold and having heteroclinic connections. As a particular case, we recover classical results on the existence of diffusion orbits (Arnold's example).
