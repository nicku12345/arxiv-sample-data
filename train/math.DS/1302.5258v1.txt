In this paper, we prove the existence of infinitely many homoclinic orbits for the first order Hamiltonian systems J\dot{x}-M(t)x+ R'(t,x)=0, by the minimax methods in critical point theory, when R(t,y) satisfies the superquadratic condition {{R(t,x)}\over{\|x\r|^{2}}}\longrightarrow \pm\infty as \|x\|\longrightarrow\infty, uniformly in t, and need not satisfy the global Ambrosetti-Rabinowitz condition
