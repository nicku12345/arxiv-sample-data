In this paper we generalize [3] and prove that the class of accessible and saddle-conservative cocycles (a wide class which includes cocycles evolving in GL(d,R), SL(d,R) and Sp(d,R) Lp-densely have a simple spectrum. We also generalize [3, 1] and prove that for an Lp-residual subset of accessible cocycles we have a one-point spectrum, by using a different approach of the one given in [3]. Finally, we show that the linear differential system versions of previous results also hold and give some applications.
