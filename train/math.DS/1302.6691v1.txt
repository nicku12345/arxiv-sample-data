Let f_{i}, i=1,2 be piecewise-smooth C^{1} circle homeomorphisms with two break points, \log Df_{i}, i=1,2 are absolutely continuous on each continuity intervals of Df_{i} and D\log Df_{i}\in L^{p} for some p>1. Suppose, the jump ratios of f_{1}  and f_{2}  at their break points do not coincide but have the same total jumps (i.e. the product of jump ratios) and identical irrational rotation number of bounded type. Then the conjugation h between f_{1}  and f_{2}  is a singular function, i.e. it is continuous on S^1, but Dh(x)=0 a.e. with respect to Lebesgue measure.
