It is well known that the rotation number of a circle homeomorphism defined by H. Poincar\'e allows to completely understand the dynamics of such a map from the topological point of view. In this paper, we collect some results concerning the existence of topological dynamical models associated to rotation sets of homeomorphisms of \T^2.
