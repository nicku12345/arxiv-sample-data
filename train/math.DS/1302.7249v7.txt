We consider the dynamics associated with an arbitrary semigroup of transcendental entire functions. Fatou-Julia theory is used to investigate the dynamics of these semigroups. Several results of the dynamics associated with iteration of a transcendental entire function have been extended to transcendental semigroup case. We also investigate the dynamics of conjugate semigroups, Abelian transcendental semigroups and wandering and Baker domains of transcendental semigroups.
