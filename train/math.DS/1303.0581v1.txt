We study phase transitions for the topological pressure of geometric potentials of transitive sets. The sets considered are partially hyperbolic having a step skew product dynamics over a horseshoe with one-dimensional fibers corresponding to the central direction. The sets are genuinely non-hyperbolic containing intermingled horseshoes of different hyperbolic behavior (contracting and expanding center).   We prove that for every k\ge 1 there is a diffeomorphism F with a transitive set \Lambda as above such that the pressure map P(t)=P(t\, \varphi) of the potential \varphi= -\log \,\lVert dF|_{E^c}\rVert (E^c the central direction) defined on \Lambda has k rich phase transitions. This means that there are parameters t_\ell, \ell=1,...,k, where P(t) is not differentiable and this lack of differentiability is due to the coexistence of two equilibrium states of t_\ell\,\varphi with positive entropy and different Birkhoff averages. Each phase transition is associated to a gap in the central Lyapunov spectrum of F on \Lambda.
