It is known that the Principal Poincar\'e Pontryagin Function is generically an Abelian integral. We give a sufficient condition on monodromy to ensure that it is an Abelian integral also in non generic cases. In non generic cases it is an iterated integral. Uribe [17, 18] gives in a special case a precise description of the Principal Poincar\'e Pontryagin Function, an iterated integral of length at most 2, involving logarithmic functions with only one ramification at a point at infinity. We extend this result to some non isodromic families of real Morse polynomials.
