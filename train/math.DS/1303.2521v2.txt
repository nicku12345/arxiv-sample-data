We study the dynamics of iteration function systems generated by a pair of circle diffeomorphisms close to rotations in the C^{1+\mathrm{bv}}-topology. We characterize the obstruction to minimality and describe the limit set. In particular, there are no invariant minimal Cantor sets, which can be seen as a Denjoy/Duminy type theorem for iterated systems on the circle.
