It is a theorem of Denker and Urba\'nski ('91) that if T:\mathbb C\to\mathbb C is a rational map of degree at least two and if \phi:\mathbb C\to\mathbb R is H\"older continuous and satisfies the "thermodynamic expanding" condition P(T,\phi) > \sup(\phi), then there exists exactly one equilibrium state \mu for T and \phi, and furthermore (\mathbb C,T,\mu) is metrically exact. We extend these results to the case of a holomorphic random dynamical system on \mathbb C, using the concepts of relative pressure and relative entropy of such a system, and the variational principle of Bogensch\"utz ('92/'93). Specifically, if (T,\Omega,\textbf P,\theta) is a holomorphic random dynamical system on \mathbb C and \phi:\Omega\to H_\alpha(\mathbb C) is a H\"older continuous random potential function satisfying one of several sets of technical but reasonable hypotheses, then there exists a unique equilibrium state of (\mathbb X,\mathbb T,\phi) over (\Omega,\textbf P,\theta).   Also included is a general (non-thermodynamic) discussion of random dynamical systems acting on \mathbb C, generalizing several basic results from the deterministic case.
