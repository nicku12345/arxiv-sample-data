We prove maximal inequalities for concentric ball and spherical shell averages on a general Gromov hyperbolic group, in arbitrary probability preserving actions of the group. Under an additional condition, satisfied for example by all groups acting isometrically and properly discontinuously on CAT(-1) spaces, we prove a pointwise ergodic theorem with respect to a sequence of probability measures supported on concentric spherical shells.
