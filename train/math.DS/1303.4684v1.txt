Let H stand for the set of homeomorphisms on [0,1]. We prove the following dichotomy for Borel subsets A of [0,1]: either there exists a homeomorphism f in H such that the image f(A) contains no 3-term arithmetic progressions; or, for every f in H, the image f(A) contains arithmetic progressions of arbitrary finite length.   In fact, we show that the first alternative holds if and only if the set A is meager (a countable union of nowhere dense sets).
