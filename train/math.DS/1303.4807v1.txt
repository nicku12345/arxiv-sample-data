In this paper, two competitive Lotka-Volterra populations in the two-patch-system with diffusion are considered. Each of the two spiecies can diffuse indepently and discretely between its in intrapatch and interpatch. By means of constructing Liapunov function, under moderate condition, the system has a unique almost periodic solution and which is asymptotically stable and globally attractive .
