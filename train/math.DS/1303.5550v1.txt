The present work is the first of a serie of two papers, in which we analyse the higher variational equations associated to natural Hamiltonian systems, in their attempt to give Galois obstruction to their integrability. We show that the higher variational equations VE_{p} for p\geq 2, although complicated they are, have very particular algebraic structure. Preceisely they are solvable if VE_{1} is virtually Abelian since they are solvable inductively by what we call the \emph{second level integrals}. We then give necessary and sufficient conditions in terms of these second level integrals for VE_{p} to be virtually Abelian (see Theorem 3.1). Then, we apply the above to potentials of degree k=\pm 2 by considering their VE_{p} along Darboux points. And this because their VE_{1} does not give any obstruction to the integrablity. In Theorem 1.2, we show that under non-resonance conditions, the only degree two integrable potential is the \emph{harmonic oscillator}. In contrast for degree -2 potentials, all the VE_{p} along Darboux points are virtually Abelian (see Theorem 1.3)
