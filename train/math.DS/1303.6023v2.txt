Let H = \mathrm{SO}(n,1) and A =\{a(t) : t \in \mathbb{R}\} be a maximal \mathbb{R}-split Cartan subgroup of H. Let G be a Lie group containing H and \Gamma be a lattice of G. Let x = g\Gamma \in G/\Gamma be a point of G/\Gamma such that its H-orbit Hx is dense in G/\Gamma.   Let \phi: I= [a,b] \rightarrow H be an analytic curve, then \phi(I)x gives an analytic curve in G/\Gamma. In this article, we will prove the following result: if \phi(I) satisfies some explicit geometric condition, then a(t)\phi(I)x tends to be equidistributed in G/\Gamma as t \rightarrow \infty. It answers the first question asked by Shah in ~\cite{Shah_1} and generalizes the main result of that paper.
