Quasi-invariant measures for non-discrete groups of diffeomorphisms containing a Morse-Smale dynamics are studied. The assumption concerning the presence of a Morse-Smale dynamics allows us to extend to higher dimensions a number of recently established results for non-discrete groups acting on the circle. These results are also applied to show that, for many groups as above, every continuous orbit equivalence must coincide almost everywhere with a diffeomorphism of the corresponding manifold.
