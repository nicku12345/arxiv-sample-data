We show that a synchronized coded system X is intrinsically ergodic of full support if and only if  h(Y), the topological entropy of Y, is less than h(X)  whenever Y is a proper subsystem of  X . We also show that like systems with specification property, SVGL's the non-mixing extension of systems with specification property, are intrinsically ergodic of full support. Moreover, we compute the entropy of the underlying graph of the Fischer cover of a synchronized system.
