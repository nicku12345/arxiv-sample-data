Let T be a continuous self-map of a compact metric space X. The transformation T induces natural a continuous self-map T_K on the hyperspace K(X) of all non-empty closed subsets of X. In this paper, we show that the system (K(X),T_K) on the hyperspace is Devaney chaotic if and only if (K(X),T_K) is an HY-system if and only if (X,T) is an HY-system, where a system (Y,S) is called an HY-system if it is totally transitive and has dense small periodic sets.
