Starting from the notion of discriminantly separable polynomials of degree two in each of three variables, we construct a class of integrable dynamical systems. These systems can be integrated explicitly in genus two theta-functions in a procedure which is similar to the classical one for the Kowalevski top. The discriminnatly separable polynomials play the role of the Kowalevski fundamental equation. The natural examples include the Sokolov systems and the Jurdjevic elasticae.
