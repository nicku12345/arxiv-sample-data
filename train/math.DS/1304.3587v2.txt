We show that the images via z\mapsto z^m of the continuous part of the spectral measures of the dynamical systems generated by the 0-1 sequences of the Thue-Morse type are pairwise mutually singular for different odd numbers m\in\N. Sarnak's conjecture on orthogonality with the M\"obius function is shown to hold for such dynamical systems. The same conjecture is shown to hold for all systems induced by regular Toeplitz sequences. A non-regular Toeplitz sequence for which Sarnak's conjecture fails is constructed.
