We study a trajectory-planning problem whose solution path evolves by means of a Lie group action and passes near a designated set of target positions at particular times. This is a higher-order variational problem in optimal control, motivated by potential applications in computational anatomy and quantum control. Reduction by symmetry in such problems naturally summons methods from Lie group theory and Riemannian geometry. A geometrically illuminating form of the Euler-Lagrange equations is obtained from a higher-order Hamilton-Pontryagin variational formulation. In this context, the previously known node equations are recovered with a new interpretation as Legendre-Ostrogradsky momenta possessing certain conservation properties. Three example applications are discussed as well as a numerical integration scheme that follows naturally from the Hamilton-Pontryagin principle and preserves the geometric properties of the continuous-time solution.
