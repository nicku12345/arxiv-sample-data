We give an explicit family of polynomial maps called center unstable H\'enon-like maps and prove that they exhibits blenders for some parametervalues. Using this family, we also prove the occurrence of blenders near certain non-transverse heterodimensional cycles under high regularity assumptions. The proof involves a renormalization scheme along heteroclinic orbits. We also investigate the connection between the blender and the original heterodimensional cycle.
