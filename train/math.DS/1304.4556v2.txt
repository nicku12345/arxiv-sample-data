Let \Cal S be an abelian finitely generated semigroup of endomorphisms of a probability space (\Omega, {\Cal A}, \mu), with (T_1, ..., T_d) a system of generators in {\Cal S}. Given an increasing sequence of domains (D_n) \subset \N^d, a question is the convergence in distribution of the normalized sequence |D_n|^{-\frac12} \sum_{{\k} \, \in D_n} \, f \circ T^{\,{\k}}, for f \in L^2_0(\mu), where T^{\k}= T_1^{k_1} ... T_d^{k_d}, {\k}= (k_1, ..., k_d) \in {\N}^d. After a preliminary spectral study when the action of \Cal S has a Lebesgue spectrum, we consider \N^d- or \Z^d-actions given by commuting toral automorphisms or endomorphisms on \T^\rho, \rho \geq 1. For a totally ergodic action by automorphisms, we show a CLT for the above normalized sequence or other summation methods like barycenters, as well as a criterion of non-degeneracy of the variance, when f is regular on the torus. A CLT is also proved for some semigroups of endomorphisms. Classical results on the existence and the construction of such actions by automorphisms are recalled.
