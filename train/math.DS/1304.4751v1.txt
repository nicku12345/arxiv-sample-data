We prove here the smoothness and the irreducibility of the periodic dynatomic curves  (c,z)\in \C^2 such that z is n-periodic for z^d+c, where d\geq2. We use the method provided by Xavier Buff and Tan Lei in \cite{BT} where they prove the conclusion for d=2. The proof for smoothness is based on elementary calculations on the pushforwards of specific quadratic differentials, following Thurston and Epstein, while the proof for irreducibility is a simplified version of Lau-Schleicher's proof by using elementary arithmetic properties of kneading sequence instead of internal addresses.
