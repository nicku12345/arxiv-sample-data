By introducing a new invariant called the set of slidings, we give a complete strict classification of the class of germs of non-dicritical holomorphic foliations in the plan whose Camacho-Sad indices are not rational. Moreover, we will show that, in this class, the new invariant is finitely determined. Consequently, the finite determination of the class of isoholonomic non-dicritical foliations and absolutely dicritical foliations that have the same Dulac maps are proved.
