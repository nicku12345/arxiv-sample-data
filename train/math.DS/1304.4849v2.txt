We study the preperiodic dynatomic curves \mathcal{X}\_{n,p}, the closure of set of (c,z)\in \C^2 such that z is a preperiodic point of f\_c with preperiod n and period p (n,p\geq1). We prove that each \mathcal{X}\_{n,p} has exactly d-1 irreducible components, these components are all smooth and intersect pairwisely at the singular points of \mathcal{X}\_{n,p}. For each component, we calculate the genus of its compactification and then give a complete topological description of \mathcal{X}\_{n,p}. We also calculate the Galois group of the defining polynomial of \mathcal{X}\_{n,p}.
