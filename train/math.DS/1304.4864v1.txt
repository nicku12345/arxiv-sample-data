We consider in this paper a sequence of complex analytic functions constructed by the following procedure f_n(z)=f_{n-1}(z)f_{n-2}(z)+c, where c\in\C is a parameter. Our aim is to give a thorough dynamical study of this family, in particular we are able to extend the familiar notions of Julia sets and Green function and to analyze their properties. As a consequence, we extend some well-known results. Finally we study in detail the case where c is small.
