The paper presents derivation and interpretation of one type of variable order derivative definitions. For mathematical modelling of considering definition the switching and numerical scheme is given. The paper also introduces a numerical scheme for a variable order derivatives based on matrix approach. Using this approach, the identity of the switching scheme and considered definition is derived. The switching scheme can be used as an interpretation of this type of definition. Paper presents also numerical examples for introduced methods. Finally, the idea and results of analog (electrical) realization of the switching fractional order integrator (of orders 0.5 and 1) are presented and compared with numerical approach.
