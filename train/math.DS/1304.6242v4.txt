We start the study of the family of birational maps (f_{\alpha,\beta}) of \mathbb{P}^2_\mathbb{C} in \cite{Deserti}. For generic \alpha and \beta of modulus 1 the centraliser of f_{\alpha,\beta} is trivial, the topological entropy of f_{\alpha,\beta} is 0, there exist two areas of linearisation: in the first one the closure of the orbit of a point is a torus, in the other one the closure of the orbit of a point is the union of two circles. On \mathbb{P}^1_\mathbb{C}\times \mathbb{P}^1_\mathbb{C} any f_{\alpha,\beta} can be viewed as a cocyle; using recent results about \mathrm{SL}(2;\mathbb{C})-cocycles (\cite{Avila}) we determine the \textsc{Lyapunov} exponent of the cocyle associated to f_{\alpha,\beta}.
