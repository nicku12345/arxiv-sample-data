An infra-nilmanifold is a manifold which is constructed as a quotient space \Gamma\backslash G of a simply connected nilpotent Lie group G, where \Gamma is a discrete group acting properly discontinuously and cocompactly on G via so called affine maps. The manifold \Gamma\backslash G is said to be modeled on the Lie group G. This class of manifolds is conjectured to be the only class of closed manifolds allowing an Anosov diffeomorphism. However, it is far from obvious which of these infra--nilmanifolds actually do admit an Anosov diffeomorphism. In this paper we completely solve this question for infra-nilmanifolds modeled on a free c--step nilpotent Lie group.
