In this work we are going to study the dynamics of the linear automorphisms of a measure convolution algebra over a finite group, T(\mu)=\nu * \mu. In order to understand an classify the asymptotic behavior of this dynamical system we provide an alternative to classical results, a very direct way to understand convergence of the sequence \{\nu^{n}\}_{n\in\mathbb{N}}, where G is a finite group, \nu\in\mathcal{P}(G) and \nu^n=\underbrace{\nu\ast...\ast\nu}_n, trough the subgroup generated by his support.
