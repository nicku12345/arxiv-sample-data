Let H_3(\Bbb R) denote the 3-dimensional real Heisenberg group. Given a family of lattices \Gamma_1\supset\Gamma_2\supset\cdots in it, let T stand for the associated uniquely ergodic H_3(\Bbb R)-{\it odometer}, i.e. the inverse limit of the H_3(\Bbb R)-actions by rotations on the homogeneous spaces H_3(\Bbb R)/\Gamma_j, j\in\Bbb N. The decomposition of the underlying Koopman unitary representation of H_3(\Bbb R) into a countable direct sum of irreducible components is explicitly described. The ergodic 2-fold self-joinings of T are found. It is shown that in general, the H_3(\Bbb R)-odometers are neither isospectral nor spectrally determined.
