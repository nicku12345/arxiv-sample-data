In this paper we mainly address the problem of disintegration of Lebesgue measure and measure of maximal entropy along the central foliation of (conservative) Derived from Anosov (DA) diffeomorphisms. We prove that for accessible DA diffeomorphisms of \mathbb{T}^3, atomic disintegration has the peculiarity of being mono-atomic (one atom per leaf). We further provide open and non-empty condition for the existence of atomic disintegration. Finally, we prove some new relations between Lyapunov exponents of DA diffeomorphisms and their linearization.
