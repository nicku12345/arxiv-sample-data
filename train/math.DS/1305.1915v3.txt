We show that partially hyperbolic diffeomorphisms of d-dimensional tori isotopic to an Anosov diffeomorphism, where the isotopy is contained in the set of partially hyperbolic diffeomorphisms, are dynamically coherent. Moreover, we show a \textit{global stability result}, i.e. every partially hyperbolic diffeomorphism as above is \textit{leaf-conjugate} to the linear one. As a consequence, we obtain intrinsic ergodicity and measure equivalence for partially hyperbolic diffeomorphisms with one-dimensional center direction that are isotopic to Anosov diffeomorphisms through such a path.
