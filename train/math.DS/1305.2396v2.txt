Lecture notes of a course at the Brazilian Mathematical Colloquium. We review some basic notions in ergodic theory and thermodynamic formalism, as well as introductory results in the context of max-plus algebra, in order to exhibit some properties of equilibrium measures when temperature goes to zero.
