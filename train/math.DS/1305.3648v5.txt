We prove that any ergodic nonatomic probability-preserving action of an irreducible lattice in a semisimple group, at least one factor being connected and higher-rank, is essentially free. This generalizes the result of Stuck and Zimmer that the same statement holds when the ambient group is a semisimple real Lie group and every simple factor is higher-rank.   We also prove a generalization of a result of Bader and Shalom by showing that any probability-preserving action of a product of simple groups, at least one with property (T), which is ergodic for each simple subgroup is either essentially free or essentially transitive.   Our method involves the study of relatively contractive maps and the Howe-Moore property, rather than the relaying on algebraic properties of semisimple groups and Poisson boundaries, and introduces a generalization of the ergodic decomposition to invariant random subgroups of independent interest.
