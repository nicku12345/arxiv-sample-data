Planar hyperbolic diffeomorphisms can be referred to two cases: Poincar\'{e} domain (both eigenvalues lie inside the unit circle S^1) and Siegel domain (one eigenvalue inside S^1 but the other outside S^1). In Poincar\'{e} domain it was proved that C^{1,\alpha} smoothness with \alpha_0:=1-\log|\lambda_2|/\log|\lambda_1|<\alpha\le 1, where \lambda_1 and \lambda_2 are both eigenvalues such that 0<|\lambda_1|<|\lambda_2|<1, admits C^1 linearization and the linearization is actually C^{1,\beta}. While a sharp H\"older exponent \beta>0 is given, an interesting problem is: Is the exponent \alpha_0 also sharp? On the other hand, in Siegel domain we only know that C^{1,\alpha} smoothness with \alpha\in (0,1] admits C^1 linearization. In this paper we further study the sharpness for C^1 linearization in both cases.
