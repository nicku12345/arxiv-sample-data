Assuming Sarnak conjecture is true for any singular dynamical process, we prove that the spectral measure of the M\"{o}bius function is equivalent to Lebesgue measure. Conversely, under Elliott conjecture, we establish that the M\"{o}bius function is orthogonal to any uniquely ergodic dynamical system with singular spectrum. Furthermore, using Mirsky Theorem, we find a new simple proof of Cellarosi-Sinai Theorem on the orthogonality of the square of the M\"{o}bius function with respect to any weakly mixing dynamical system. Finally, we establish Sarnak conjecture for a particular random model.
