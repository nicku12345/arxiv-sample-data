We show that the space called shark teeth is a topological IFS-attractor, that is for every open cover of X=\bigcup_{i=1}^nf_i(X), its image under every suitable large composition from the family of continuous functions \{f_1,...,f_n\} lies in some set from the cover. In particular, there exists a space which is not homeomorphic to any IFS-attractor but is a topological IFS-attractor.
