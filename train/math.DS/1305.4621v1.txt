We study the structure of inverse limit space of so-called Fibonacci-like tent maps. The combinatorial constraints implied by the Fibonacci-like assumption allow us to introduce certain chains that enable a more detailed analysis of symmetric arcs within this space than is possible in the general case. We show that link-symmetric arcs are always symmetric or a well-understood concatenation of quasi-symmetric arcs. This leads to the proof of the Ingram Conjecture for cores of Fibonacci-like unimodal inverse limits.
