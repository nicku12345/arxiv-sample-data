According to a recent paper \cite{bopt13}, polynomials from the closure \bar{\rm PHD}_3 of the {\em Principal Hyperbolic Domain} {\rm PHD}_3 of the cubic connectedness locus have a few specific properties. The family \mathrm{CU} of all polynomials with these properties is called the \emph{Main Cubioid}. In this paper we describe the set \mathrm{CU}^c of laminations which can be associated to polynomials from \mathrm{CU}.
