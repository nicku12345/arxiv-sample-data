This paper is concerned with the analysis of a typical singularity of piecewise smooth vector fields on R^3 composed by two zones. In our object of study, the cusp-fold singularity, we consider the simultaneous occurrence of a cusp singularity for one vector field and a fold singularity for the other one. We exhibit a normal form that presents one of the most important property searched for in piecewise smooth vector fields: the asymptotical stability.
