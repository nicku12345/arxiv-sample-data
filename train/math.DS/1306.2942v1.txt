We study random circle maps that are expanding on the average. Uniform bounds on neither expansion nor distortion are required. We construct a coupling scheme, which leads to exponential convergence of measures (memory loss) and exponential mixing. Leveraging from the structure of the associated correlation estimates, we prove an almost sure invariance principle for vector-valued observables. The motivation for our paper is to explore these methods in a nonuniform random setting.
