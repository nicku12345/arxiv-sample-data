Discontinuous time derivatives are used to model threshold-dependent switching in such diverse applications as dry friction, electronic control, and biological growth. In a continuous flow, a discon- tinuous derivative can generate multiple outcomes from a single initial state. Here we show that well defined solution sets exist for flows that become multi-valued due to grazing a discontinuity. Loss of determinism is used to quantify dynamics in the limit of infinite sensitivity to initial conditions, then applied to the dynamics of a superconducting resonator and a negatively damped oscillator.
