In this article we will see some properties that guarantee that a product of an ergodic non-singular action and a probability preserving ergodic action is also an ergodic action. We will start by proving 'The multiplier theorem' for locally compact abelian groups. Then we will show that for certain locally compact Polish groups (Moore groups, and minimally weakly mixing groups), a non-singular G action is weakly mixing if and only if any finite dimensional G-invariant subspace of L_\infty is trivial. Finally, we will show that the Gaussian action associated to the infinite dimensional irreducible representation of the continuous Heisenberg group, H_3, is weakly mixing but not mildly mixing.
