In this paper, we will construct a pre-normal form for germs of codimension one holomorphic foliation having a particular type of separatrix, of cuspidal type. We will also give a sufficient condition, in the quasi-homogeneous, three-dimensional case, for these foliations to be of generalized surface type.
