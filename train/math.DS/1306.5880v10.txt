Suppose that \mathcal{C} is the space of all middle Cantor sets. We characterize all triples (\alpha,~\beta,~\lambda)\in \mathcal{C}\times\mathcal{C}\times \mathbb{R}^* that satisfy C_\alpha- \lambda C_\beta=[-\lambda,~1].  Also all triples (that are dense in \mathcal{C}\times\mathcal{C}\times \mathbb{R}^*) has been determined such that C_\alpha- \lambda C_\beta forms the attractor of an iterated function system. Then we found a new family of the pair of middle Cantor sets \mathcal{P} in a way that for each (C_\alpha,~ C_\beta)\in\mathcal{P}, there exists a dense subfield F\subset \mathbb{R} such that for each \mu \in F, the set C_\alpha- \mu C_\beta contains an interval or has zero Lebesgue measure. In sequel, conditions on the functions f, ~g and the pair (C_\alpha,~C_\beta) is provided which f(C_{\alpha})- g(C_{\beta}) contains an interval. This leads us to denote another type of stability in the intersection of two Cantor sets. We prove the existence of this stability for regular Cantor sets that have stable intersection and its absence for those which the sum of their Hausdorff dimension is less than one. At the end, special middle Cantor sets C_\alpha and C_\beta are introduced. Then the iterated function system corresponding to the attractor C_{\alpha}-\frac{2\alpha}{\beta}C_\beta is characterized. Some specifications of the attractor has been presented that keep our example as an exception.   We also show that \sqrt{C_{\alpha}} - \sqrt{C_{\beta}} contains at least one interval.
