Let E be a linear space and suppose that A is the global attractor of either (i) a homeomorphism F:E\rightarrow E or (ii) a semigroup S(\cdot) on E that is injective on A. In both cases A has trivial shape, and the dynamics on A can be described by a homeomorphism F:A\rightarrow A (in the second case we set F=S(t) for some t>0). If the topological dimension of A is finite we show that for any \epsilon>0 there is an embedding e:A\rightarrow{\mathbb R}^k, with k\sim{\rm dim}(A), and a (dynamical) homeomorphism f:\R^k\rightarrow\R^k such that F is conjugate to f on A (i.e.\ F|_A=e^{-1}\circ f\circ e) and f has an attractor A_f with e(A)\subset A_f\subset N(e(A),\epsilon). In other words, we show that the dynamics on A is essentially finite-dimensional.   We characterise subsets of {\mathbb R}^n that can be the attractors of homeomorphisms as cellular sets, give elementary proofs of various topological results connected to Borsuk's theory of shape and cellularity in Euclidean spaces, and prove a controlled homeomorphism extension theorem.
