We show that for every compact 3-manifold M there exists an open subset of \diff ^1(M) in which every generic diffeomorphism admits uncountably many ergodic probability measures which are hyperbolic while their supports are disjoint and admit a basis of attracting neighborhoods and a basis of repelling neighborhoods. As a consequence, the points in the support of these measures have no stable and no unstable manifolds. This contrasts with the higher regularity case, where Pesin theory gives us the stable and the unstable manifolds with complementary dimensions at almost every point. We also give such an example in dimension two, without local genericity.
