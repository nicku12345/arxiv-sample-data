Any periodic trajectory on an isosceles triangle gives rise to a periodic trajectory on a right triangle obtained by identifying the halves of the original triangle. We examine the relationship between periodic trajectories on isosceles triangles and the trajectories on right triangles obtained in this manner, and the consequences of this relationship for the existence of stable trajectories on isosceles triangles and the properties of their orbit tiles.
