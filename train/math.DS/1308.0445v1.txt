The goal of this paper is to define and investigate those topological pressures, which is an extension of topological entropy presented by Feng and Huang [13], of continuous transformations. This study reveals the similarity between many known results of topological pressure. More precisely, the investigation of the variational principle is given and related propositions are also described. That is, this paper defines the measure theoretic pressure P_{\mu}(T,f) for any \mu\in{\mathcal M(X)}, and shows that P_B(T,f,K)=\sup\bigr\{P_{\mu}(T,f):{\mu}\in{\mathcalM(X)},{\mu}(K)=1\bigr\}, where K\subseteq X is a non-empty compact subset and P_B(T,f,K) is the Bowen topological pressure on K. Furthermore, if Z\subseteq X is an analytic subset, then P_B(T,f,Z)=\sup\bigr\{P_B(T,f,K):K\subseteq Z\ \text{is compact}\bigr\}. However, this analysis relies on more techniques of ergodic theory and topological dynamics.
