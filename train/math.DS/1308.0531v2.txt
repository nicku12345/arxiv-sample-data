The current paper is devoted to the study of semilinear dispersal evolution equations of the form  u_t(t,x)=(\mathcal{A}u)(t,x)+u(t,x)f(t,x,u(t,x)),\quad x\in\mathcal{H},  where \mathcal{H}=\RR^N or \ZZ^N, \mathcal{A} is a random dispersal operator or nonlocal dispersal operator in the case \mathcal{H}=\RR^N and is a discrete dispersal operator in the case \mathcal{H}=\ZZ^N, and f is periodic in t, asymptotically periodic in x (i.e. f(t,x,u)-f_0(t,x,u) converges to 0 as \|x\|\to\infty for some time and space periodic function f_0(t,x,u)), and is of KPP type in u. It is proved that Liouville type property for such equations holds, that is, time periodic strictly positive solutions are unique. It is also proved that if u\equiv 0 is a linearly unstable solution to the time and space periodic limit equation of such an equation, then it has a unique stable time periodic strictly positive solution and has a spatial spreading speed in every direction.
