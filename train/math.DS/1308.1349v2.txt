We revisit the problem of well-defining rotation numbers for discrete random dynamical systems on the circle. We show that, contrasting with deterministic systems, the topological (i.e. based on Poincar\'{e} lifts) approach does depend on the choice of lifts (e.g. continuously for nonatomic randomness). Furthermore, the winding orbit rotation number does not agree with the topological rotation number. Existence and conversion formulae between these distinct numbers are presented. Finally, we prove a sampling in time theorem which recover the rotation number of continuous Stratonovich stochastic dynamical systems on S^1 out of its time discretisation of the flow.
