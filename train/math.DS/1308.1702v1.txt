Realization of d-dimensional effective subshifts as projective sub-actions of d+d'-dimensional sofic subshifts for d'\geq 1 is now well know~\cite{Hochman-2009,Durand-Romashchenko-Shen-2010,Aubrun-Sablik-2010}. In this paper we are interested in the speed of convergence of this realization. That is to say given an effective subshift \Sigma realized as projective sub-action of a sofic \T, we study the function which on input an integer k returns the smallest width of the strip which verify the local rules of \T necessary to obtain exclusively the language of size k of \Sigma in the central row of the strip. We study this topological conjugacy invariant for effective subshifts in order to exhibit algorithmic properties of these subshifts.
