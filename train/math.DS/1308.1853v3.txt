This article presents a generalization of the notion of \emph{Poincar\'e rotation set} to homeomorphisms of the ad\`ele class group \mathbb{A}/\mathbb{Q} of the rational numbers \mathbb{Q}, which is a connected compact abelian group which can be identified with the one-dimensional universal solenoid \mathbf{S}, \ie the algebraic universal covering of the circle. The definition is first introduced in general for homeomorphisms of \mathbf{S} which are isotopic to a translation, and then specializing in homeomorphisms of \mathbf{S} isotopic to the identity, in which case the rotation set is a closed interval contained in the base leaf (the connected component of the identity). If in the latter case the rotation interval reduces to a single element \rho and \rho is irrational (\ie it is a monothetic generator of \mathbf{S}), we show that the homeomorphism is semiconjugate to the translation z\mapsto\rho{z}, like in the classical theory of Poincar\'e. This theory is valid for any general compact abelian one dimensional solenoidal group \mathbf{S}_G, which are Pontryagin duals of dense subgroups G of the rational numbers with the discrete topology. These solenoidal groups are one-dimensional laminations which are locally homeomorphic to the product of a Cantor set by an interval so they behave very much like a ``diffuse'' version of the circle. Our approach differs from others because we use Pontryagin duality of compact abelian groups to define the rotation sets.   \end{abstract}
