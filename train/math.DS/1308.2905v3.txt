Let T:[0,1]\to[0,1] be the doubling map and let 0<a<b<1. We say that an integer n\ge3 is bad for (a,b) if all n-cycles for T intersect (a,b). Let B(a,b) denote the set of all n which are bad for (a,b). In this paper we completely describe the sets: \[ D_2=\{(a,b) : B(a,b)\,\text{is finite}\} \] and \[ D_3=\{(a,b) : B(a,b)=\varnothing\}. \] In particular, we show that if b-a<\frac16, then (a,b)\in D_2, and if b-a\le\frac2{15}, then (a,b)\in D_3, both constants being sharp.
