The Lorentz gas of \mathbb{Z}^2-periodic scatterers (or the so called Sinai billiards) can be used to model motion of electrons on an ionized medal. We investigate the linear response for the system under various external forces (during both the flight and the collision). We give some characterizations under which the forced system is time-reversible, and derive an estimate of the electrical current generated by the forced system. Moreover, applying Pesin entropy formula and Young dimension formula, we get several characterizations of the non-equilibrium steady state of the forced system.
