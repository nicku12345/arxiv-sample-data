We present some work relating to fractal transformations on masked iterated function systems and demonstrate how well known algorithms for generating fractal transformations can be modifed for these systems. We also demonstrate that these algorithms work equally well when applied to three dimensional data sets and suggest some possible applications to special effects and modelling.
