The principal results proved in this expository thesis are the IP polynomial Szemer\'edi theorem for nilpotent groups and the multiple term return times theorem with nilsequence weights. It also contains extensions of the convergence theorem for nilpotent polynomial multiple ergodic averages and the return times theorem to locally compact second countable amenable groups.
