It is known that Lotka - Volterra type differential equations with delays or distributed delays have an important role in modeling ecological systems. In this paper we study the effects of distributed delay on the dynamics of the harvested one predator - two prey model. Using the expectation of the distribution of the delay as a bifurcation parameter, we show that the equilibrium that was asymptotic stable becomes unstable and Hopf bifurcation can occur as the expectation crosses some critical values.
