This paper concerns the behaviour of the apsidal angle for orbits of central force system with homogenous potential of degree -2\leq \alpha\leq 1 and logarithmic potential. We derive a formula for the apsidal angle as a fixed-end points integral and we study the derivative of the apsidal angle with respect to the angular momentum \ell. The monotonicity of the apsidal angle as function of \ell is discussed and it is proved in the logarithmic potential case.
