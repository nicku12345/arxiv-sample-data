In this paper we study the interaction between natural convection and heat explosion in porous media. The model consists of the heat equation with a nonlinear source term describing heat production due to an exothermic chemical reaction coupled with the Darcy law. Stationary and oscillating convection regimes and oscillating heat explosion are observed. The models with quasi-stationary and unstationary Darcy equation are compared.
