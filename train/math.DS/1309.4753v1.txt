This paper is to investigate the dependence of the principal spectrum points of nonlocal dispersal operators on underlying parameters and to consider its applications. In particular, we study the effects of the spatial inhomogeneity, the dispersal rate, and the dispersal distance on the existence of the principal eigenvalues, the magnitude of the principal spectrum points, and the asymptotic behavior of the principal spectrum points of nonlocal dispersal operators with Dirichlet type, Neumann type, and periodic boundary conditions in a unified way. We also discuss the applications of the principal spectral theory of nonlocal dispersal operators to the asymptotic dynamics of two species competition systems with nonlocal dispersal.
