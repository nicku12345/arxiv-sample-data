Let I=[0,1] and consider disjoint closed regions G_{1},....,G_{n} in % I\times I and subintervals I_{1},......,I_{n}, such that G_{i} projects onto I_{i.} We define the lower and upper maps \tau_{1}, \tau_{2} by the lower and upper boundaries of G_{i},i=1,....,n, respectively. We assume \tau_{1}, \tau_{2} to be piecewise monotonic and preserving continuous invariant measures \mu_{1} and \mu_{2}, respectively. Let % F^{(1)} and F^{(2)} be the distribution functions of \mu_{1} and \mu_{2}. The main results shows that for any convex combination F of % F^{(1)}  and F^{(2)} we can find a map \eta  with values between the graphs of \tau_{1} and \tau_{2} (that is, a selection) such that F is the \eta -invariant distribution function. Examples are presented. We also study the relationship of the dynamics of multi-valued maps to random maps.
