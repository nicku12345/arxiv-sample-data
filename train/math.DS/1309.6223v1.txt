Given a \mathbb Z^r-action \alpha on a nilmanifold X by automorphisms and an ergodic \alpha-invariant probability measure \mu, we show that \mu is the uniform measure on X, unless modulo finite index modification, one of the following obstructions occurs for an algebraic factor action: 1. The factor measure has zero entropy under every element of the action; 2. The factor action is virtually cyclic. We also deduce a rigidity property for invariant closed subsets.
