We consider an isomorphism invariant for measure-preserving systems - types of generalized entropy convergence rates. We show the connections of this invariant with the types of Shannon entropy convergence rates. In the case when they differ we show several facts for aperiodic, completely ergodic and rank one systems. We use this concept to distinguish some measure-preserving systems with zero entropy.
