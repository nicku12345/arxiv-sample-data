Let (X, \sigma_X), (Y, \sigma_Y) be one-sided subshifts with the specification property and \pi:X\rightarrow Y a factor map. Let \mu be a unique invariant Gibbs measure for a sequence of continuous functions \F=\{\log f_n\}_{n=1}^{\infty} on X, which is an almost additive potential with bounded variation. We show that \pi\mu is also a unique invariant Gibbs measure for a sequence of continuous functions \G=\{\log g_n\}_{n=1}^{\infty} on Y. When (X, \sigma_X) is a full shift, we characterize \G and \mu by using relative pressure. This almost additive potential \G is a generalization of a continuous function found by Pollicott and Kempton in their work on the images of Gibbs measures for continuous functions under factor maps. We also consider the following question: Given a unique invariant Gibbs measure \nu for a sequence of continuous functions \F_2 on Y, can we find an invariant Gibbs measure \mu for a sequence of continuous functions \F_1 on X such that \pi\mu=\nu? We show that such a measure exists under a certain condition. If (X, \sigma_X) is a full shift and \nu is a unique invariant Gibbs measure for a function in the Bowen class, then we can find a preimage \mu of \nu which is a unique invariant Gibbs measure for a function in the Bowen class.
