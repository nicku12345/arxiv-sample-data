This paper is devoted to study ergodic optimisation problems for almost-additive sequences of functions (rather than a fixed potential) defined over countable Markov shifts (that is a non-compact space). Under certain assumptions we prove that any accumulation point of a family of Gibbs equilibrium measures is a maximising measure. Applications are given in the study of the joint spectral radius and to multifractal analysis of Lyapunov exponent of non-conformal maps.
