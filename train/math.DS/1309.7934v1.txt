We examine the renormalization operator determined by the Fibonacci substitution. We exhibit a fixed point and determine its stable leaf (under iteration of the operator). Then, we study the thermodynamic formalism for po- tentials in this stable leaf, and prove they have a freezing phase transition, with ground state supported on the attracting quasi-crystal associated to the Fibonacci substitution
