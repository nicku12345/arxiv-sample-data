Ultrafilters are very useful and versatile objects with applications throughout mathematics: in topology, analysis, combinarotics, model theory, and even theory of social choice. Proofs based on ultrafilters tend to be shorter and more elegant than their classical counterparts. In this thesis, we survey some of the most striking ways in which ultrafilters can be exploited in combinatorics and ergodic theory, with a brief mention of model theory.   In the initial sections, we establish the basics of the theory of ultrafilters in the hope of keeping our exposition possibly self-contained, and then proceed to specific applications. Important combinatorial results we discuss are the theorems of Hindman, van der Waerden and Hales-Jewett. Each of them asserts essentially that in a finite partition of, respectively, the natural numbers or words over a finite alphabet, one cell much of the combinatorial structure. We next turn to results in ergodic theory, which rely strongly on combinatorial preliminaries. They assert essentially that certain sets of return times are combinatorially rich. We finish by presenting the ultrafilter proof of the famous Arrow's Impossibility Theorem and the construction of the ultraproduct in model theory.
