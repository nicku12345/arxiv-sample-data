In this paper we consider several families of potential non-isochronous systems and study their associated period functions. Firstly, we prove some properties of these functions, like their local behavior near the critical point or infinity, or their global monotonicity. Secondly, we show that these properties are also present when we approach to the same questions using the Harmonic Balance Method.
