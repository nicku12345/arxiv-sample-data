We construct an extensive adiabatic invariant for a Klein-Gordon chain in the thermodynamic limit. In particular, given a fixed and sufficiently small value of the coupling constant a, the evolution of the adiabatic invariant is controlled up to times scaling as \beta^{1/\sqrt{a}} for any large enough value of the inverse temperature \beta. The time scale becomes a stretched exponential if the coupling constant is allowed to vanish jointly with the specific energy. The adiabatic invariance is exhibited by showing that the variance along the dynamics, i.e. calculated with respect to time averages, is much smaller than the corresponding variance over the whole phase space, i.e. calculated with the Gibbs measure, for a set of initial data of large measure. All the perturbative constructions and the subsequent estimates are consistent with the extensive nature of the system.
