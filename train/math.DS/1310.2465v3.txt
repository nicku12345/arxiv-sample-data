Let BS(1,n)= <a,b : a b a ^{-1} = b ^n> be the solvable Baumslag-Solitar group, where n \geq 2. We study representations of BS(1, n) by homeomorphisms of closed surfaces with (pseudo-)Anosov elements. That is, we consider a closed surface S, and homeomorphisms f, h: S \to S such that h f h^{-1} = f^n, for some  n\geq 2. It is known that f (or some power of f) must be homotopic to the identity. Suppose that h is pseudo-Anosov with stretch factor \lambda >1. We show that <f,h> is not a faithful representation of BS(1, n) if \lambda > n. Moreover, we show that there are no faithful representations of BS(1, n) by torus homeomorphisms with h an Anosov map and f area preserving (regardless of the value of \lambda).
