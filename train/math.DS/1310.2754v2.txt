We consider diffeomorphisms of compact Riemmanian manifolds which have a Gibbs-Markov-Young structures, consisting of a reference set \Lambda with a hyperbolic product structure and a countable Markov partition. We assume polynomial contraction on stable leaves, polynomial backward contraction on unstable leaves, a bounded distortion property and a certain regularity of the stable foliation. We establish a control on the decay of correlations and large deviations of the SRB measure of the dynamical system, based on a polynomial control on the Lebesgue measure of the tail of return times. Finally, we present an example of a dynamical system defined on the torus and prove that it verifies the properties of the Gibbs-Markov-Young structure that we considered.
