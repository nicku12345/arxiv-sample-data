Walsh has recently proved the norm convergence of all nonconventional ergodic averages involving polynomial sequences in discrete nilpotent acting groups. He deduces this convergence from an equivalent, `finitary' assertion of stability over arbitrarily long time-intervals for these averages, which is proved by essentially finitary means. The present paper shows how the induction at the heart of Walsh's proof can also be implemented using more classical notions of ergodic theory: in particular, couplings and characteristic factors.
