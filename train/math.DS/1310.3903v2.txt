We consider the Lagrange and the Markov dynamical spectra associated to horseshoes on surface with Hausdorff dimensions greater than 1. We show that for a "large" set of real functions on the surface and for "typical" horseshoes with Hausdorff dimensions greater than 1, then both the Lagrange and the Markov dynamical spectrum have persistently non-empty interior.
