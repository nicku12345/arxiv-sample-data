In this paper we study the dynamics of a family of diffeomorphisms in \bR^2 defined by  F(x,y)=(g(x)+h(y),h(x)),  where  g(x)  is a unimodal C^2-map which has the same dynamical properties as the logistic map P(x)=\mu x(1-x), and h(x)  is a C^2 map which is a small perturbation of a linear map. For certain maps of this form we show that there are exactly two periodic points, namely an attracting fixed point and a saddle fixed point and the boundary of the basin of attraction is the stable manifold of the saddle.   The basin boundary also has the same regularity as F, in contrast to the frequently observed fractal nature of basin boundaries. To establish these results we describe the orbits under forward and backward iteration of every point in the plane.
