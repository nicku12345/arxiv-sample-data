We investigate the behavior of trajectories of a (3,2)-rational p-adic dynamical system in the complex p-adic filed {\mathbb C}_p, when there exists a unique fixed point x_0. We study this p-adic dynamical system by dynamics of real radiuses of balls (with the center at the fixed point x_0). We show that there exists a radius r depending on parameters of the rational function such that: when x_0 is an attracting point then the trajectory of an inner point from the ball U_r(x_0) goes to x_0 and each sphere with a radius >r (with the center at x_0) is invariant; When x_0 is a repeller point then the trajectory of an inner point from a ball U_r(x_0) goes forward to the sphere S_r(x_0). Once the trajectory reaches the sphere, in the next step it either goes back to the interior of U_r(x_0) or stays in S_r(x_0) for some time and then goes back to the interior of the ball. As soon as the trajectory goes outside of U_r(x_0) it will stay (for all the rest of time) in the sphere (outside of U_r(x_0)) that it reached first.
