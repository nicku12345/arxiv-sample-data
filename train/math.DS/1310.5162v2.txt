There is a C^1-residual (Baire second class) subset \mathcal{R} of symplectic diffeomorphisms on 2d-dimensional manifold, d\geq 1, such that for every non-Anosov f in \mathcal{R} its topological entropy is lower bounded by the supremum of the Lyapunov exponents of their hyperbolic periodic points in the \emph{unbreakable central subbundle} (i.e., central direction with no dominated splitting) of f. The previous result deals with the fact that for f in a residual set \tilde{\mathcal{R}} of symplectic diffeomorphisms (containing \mathcal{R}) satisfies a trichotomy: or f is Anosov or f is robustly transitive partially hyperbolic with {\em unbreakable center} of dimension 2m, 0 < m < d, or f has totally elliptic periodic points dense on M. In the second case, we also show the existence of a sequence of m-{\em elliptic} periodic points converging to M. Indeed, \tilde{\mathcal{R}} contains an open and dense subset.
