A discrete dynamical system in Euclidean m-space generated by the iterates of an asymptotically zero map f, satisfying f(x) goes to zero as x goes to infinity, must have a compact global attracting set A . The question of what additional hypotheses are sufficient to guarantee that A has a minimal (invariant) subset A* that is a chaotic strange attractor is answered in detail for a few types of asymptotically zero maps. These special cases happen to have many applications (especially as mathematical models for a variety of processes in ecological and population dynamics), some of which are presented as examples and analyzed in considerable detail.
