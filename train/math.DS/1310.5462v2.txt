Consider perturbed KdV equations: \[u_t+u_{xxx}-6uu_x=\epsilon f(u(\cdot)),\quad x\in\mathbb{T}=\mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z},\;\int_{\mathbb{T}}u(x,t)dx=0,\] where the nonlinearity defines analytic operators u(\cdot)\mapsto f(u(\cdot)) in sufficiently smooth Sobolev spaces. Assume that the equation has an \epsilon-quasi-invariant measure \mu and satisfies some additional mild assumptions. Let u^{\epsilon}(t) be a solution. Then on time intervals of order \epsilon^{-1}, as \epsilon\to0, its actions I(u^{\epsilon}(t,\cdot)) can be approximated by solutions of a certain well-posed averaged equation, provided that the initial datum is \mu-typical.
