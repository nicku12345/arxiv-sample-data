We consider the iterates of a generic injective piecewise contraction of the interval defined by a finite family of contractions. Let \phi_i:[0,1]\to (0,1), 1\le i\le n, be C^2-diffeomorphisms with \sup_{x\in (0,1)} \vert D\phi_i(x)\vert<1 whose images \phi_1([0,1]), \ldots, \phi_n([0,1]) are pairwise disjoint. Let 0<x_1<\cdots<x_{n-1}<1 and let I_1,\ldots, I_n be a partition of the interval [0,1) into subintervals I_i having interior (x_{i-1},x_i), where x_0=0 and x_n=1. Let f_{x_1,\ldots,x_{n-1}} be the map given by x\mapsto \phi_i(x) if x\in I_i, for 1\le i\le n. Among other results we prove that for Lebesgue almost every (x_1,\ldots,x_{n-1}), the piecewise contraction f_{x_1,\ldots,x_{n-1}} is asymptotically periodic.
