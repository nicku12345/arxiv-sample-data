We present the following result: consider the space of complex polynomials of degree n>2 with n-1 distinct marked periodic orbits of given periods. Then this space is irreducible and the multipliers of the marked periodic orbits considered as algebraic functions on the above mentioned space, are algebraically independent over \mathbb C. Equivalently, this means that at its generic point, the moduli space of degree n polynomial maps can be locally parameterized by the multipliers of n-1 arbitrary distinct periodic orbits. A detailed proof of this result (together with a proof of a more general statement) is given in [arXiv:1305.0867]. In this exposition we substitute some of the technical lemmas from [arXiv:1305.0867] with more geometric arguments.
