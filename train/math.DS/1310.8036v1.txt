This paper is concerned with the traveling wave solutions of an integro-difference competition system, of which the purpose is to model the coinvasion-coexistence process of two competitors with age structure. The existence of nontrivial traveling wave solutions is obtained by constructing generalized upper and lower solutions. The asymptotic and nonexistence of traveling wave solutions are proved by combining the theory of asymptotic spreading with the idea of contracting rectangle.
