We prove for a generic star vector field X that, if for every chain recurrent class C of X all singularities in C have the same index, then the chain recurrent set of X is singular hyperbolic. We also prove that every Lyapunov stable chain recurrent class of X is singular hyperbolic. As a corollary, we prove that the chain recurrent set of a generic 4-dimensional star flow is singular hyperbolic.
