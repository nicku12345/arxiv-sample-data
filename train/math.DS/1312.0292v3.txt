In this paper, we explore a topological system f:M\rightarrow M with average shadowing property. We extend Sigmund's results and show that every non-empty, compact and connected subset V\subseteq\mathcal {M}_{inv}(f) coincides with V_f(y), where \mathcal {M}_{inv}(f) denotes the space of invariant Borel probability measures on M, and V_f(y) denotes the accumulation set of time average of Dirac measures supported at the orbit of y. We also show that the set M_{V}=\{y\in M\,\,|\,\,V_{f}(y)=V\} is dense in \Delta_{V}=\bigcup_{\nu\in V}supp(\nu). In particular, if \Delta_{max}=\bigcup_{\nu\in\mathcal {M}_{inv}(f)}supp(\nu) is isolated or coincides with M, then M_{max}=\{y: V_{f}(y)=\mathcal {M}_{inv}(f)\} is residual in \Delta_{max}.
