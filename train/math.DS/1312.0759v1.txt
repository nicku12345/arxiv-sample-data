Consider nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations with small nonlinearities   \[\frac{d}{dt}u+i(-\triangle u+V(x)u)=\epsilon \mathcal{P}(\triangle u,u,x),\quad x\in \mathbb{T}^d.\eqno{(*)}\]   Let \{\zeta_1(x),\zeta_2(x),\dots\} be the L_2-basis formed by eigenfunctions of the operator -\triangle +V(x). For any complex function u(x), write it as \mbox{u(x)=\sum_{k\geqslant1}v_k\zeta_k(x)} and set I_k(u)=\frac{1}{2}|v_k|^2. Then for any solution u(t,x) of the linear equation (*)_{\epsilon=0} we have I(u(t,\cdot))=const. In this work it is proved that if (*) is well posed on time-intervals t\lesssim \epsilon^{-1} and satisfies there some mild a-priori assumptions, then for any its solution u^{\epsilon}(t,x), the limiting behavior of the curve I(u^{\epsilon}(t,\cdot)) on time intervals of order \epsilon^{-1}, as \epsilon\to0, can be uniquely characterized by solutions of a certain well-posed effective equation.
