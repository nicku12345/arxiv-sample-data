This paper establishes bounds on norms of all orders for solutions on the global attractor of the 2D Navier-Stokes equations, complexified in time. Specifically, for periodic boundary conditions on [0,L]^2, and a force g\in\calD(A^{\frac{\alpha-1}{2}}), we show there is a fixed strip about the real time axis on which a uniform bound |A^{\alpha}u|< m_\alpha\nu\kappa_0^\alpha holds for each \alpha \in \bN. Here \nu is viscosity, \k0=2\pi/L, and m_\alpha is explicitly given in terms of g and \alpha. We show that if any element in \calA is in \D(A^\alpha), then all of \calA is in \D(A^\alpha), and likewise with \D(A^\alpha) replaced by C^\infty(\Omega). We demonstrate the universality of this "all for one, one for all" law on the union of a hierarchal set of function classes. Finally, we treat the question of whether the zero solution can be in the global attractor for a nonzero force by showing that if this is so, the force must be in a particular function class.
