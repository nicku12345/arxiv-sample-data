In this paper, we consider the following Hamilton-Jacobi equation with initial condition: \begin{equation*} \begin{cases} \partial_tu(x,t)+H(x,t,u(x,t),\partial_xu(x,t))=0, u(x,0)=\phi(x). \end{cases} \end{equation*} Under some assumptions on the convexity of H(x,t,u,p) w.r.t. p, we develop a dynamical approach to viscosity solutions and show that there exists an intrinsic connection between viscosity solutions and certain minimal characteristics.
