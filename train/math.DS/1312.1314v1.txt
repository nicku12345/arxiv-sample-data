Polygonal slap maps are piecewise affine expanding maps of the interval obtained by projecting the sides of a polygon along their normals onto the perimeter of the polygon. These maps arise in the study of polygonal billiards with non-specular reflections laws. We study the absolutely continuous invariant probabilities of the slap maps for several polygons, including regular polygons and triangles. We also present a general method for constructing polygons with slap maps having more than one ergodic absolutely continuous invariant probability.
