In this paper the local singularities of integrable Hamiltonian systems with two degrees of freedom are studied. The topological obstruction to the existence of focus-focus singularity with given complexity was found. It has been showed that only simple focus-focus singularities can appear in a typical mechanical system. The model examples of mechanical systems with complex focus-focus singularity are given.
