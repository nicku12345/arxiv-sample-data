In this paper, we prove the boundedness of all the solutions for the equation \ddot{x}+n^2x+g(x)+\psi'(x)=p(t) with the Lazer-Leach condition on g and p, where n\in \mathbb{N^+}, p(t) and \psi'(x) are periodic and g(x) is bounded. For the critical situation that \big |\int_0^{2\pi}p(t)e^{int}dt \big|=2\big|g(+\infty)-g(-\infty)\big|, we also prove a sufficient and necessary condition for the boundedness if \psi'(x)\equiv0.
