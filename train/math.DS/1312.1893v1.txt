Given a discrete group \Gamma of isometries of a negatively curved manifold \widetilde M, a nontrivial conjugacy class \mathfrak K in \Gamma and x_0\in\widetilde M, we give asymptotic counting results, as t\to +\infty, on the number of orbit points \gamma x_0 at distance at most t from x_0, when \gamma is restricted to be in \mathfrak K, as well as related equidistribution results. These results generalise and extend work of Huber on cocompact hyperbolic lattices in dimension 2. We also study the growth of given conjugacy classes in finitely generated groups endowed with a word metric.
