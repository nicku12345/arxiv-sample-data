Based on numerical results of a Silnikov equation, three period-doubling cascades, corresponding respectively to three different characters of the rotation number of a limit closed orbit, are studied, and the Feigenbaum constant is used successfully in the estimation of the critical parameter values for the period-doubling bifurcation. The conceptions of separaror and pseudo-attractor are also introduced in the discussion part of this paper.
