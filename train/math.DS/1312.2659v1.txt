We consider the synchronization of the solutions to coupled stochastic systems of N-stochastic ordinary differential equations (SODEs) driven by Non-Gaussian L\'evy noises (N\in \mathbb{N}). We discuss the synchronization between two solutions and among different components of solutions under certain dissipative and integrability conditions. Our results generalize the present work obtained in Liu et al (2010) and Shen et al (2010).
