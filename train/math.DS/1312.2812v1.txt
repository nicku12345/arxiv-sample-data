In this paper we consider functions of the type f(x) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty a_n g(b_nx+\theta_n), where (a_n) are independent random variables uniformly distributed on (-a^n, a^n) for some 0<a<1, b_{n+1}/b_n \geq b >1, a^2b> 1 and g is a C^1 periodic real function with finite number of critical points in every bounded interval. We prove that the occupation measure for f has L^2 density almost surely. Furthermore, the Hausdorff dimension of the graph of f is almost surely equal to D = 2+ \log{a}/\log{b} provided  b = \lim_{n\rightarrow \infty}b_{n+1}/b_n>1 and ab>1.
