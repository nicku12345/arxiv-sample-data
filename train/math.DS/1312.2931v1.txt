We show how the approach of Yosida approximation of the derivative serves to obtain new results for evolution systems. Using this method we obtain multivalued time dependent perturbation results. Additionally, translation invariant subspaces Y of the bounded and uniformly continuous functions are considered, to obtain criteria for the existence of solutions u\in Y to the equation  u^{\prime}(t)\in   A(t)u(t)+ \om u(t) + f(t), t\in \re,  or of solutions u asymptotically close to Y for the inhomogeneous differential equation \begin{eqnarray*} u^{\prime}(t)&\in& A(t)u(t) + \om u(t) + f(t), \ \ t > 0, u(0)&=&u_0, \end{eqnarray*} in general Banach spaces, where A(t) denotes a possibly nonlinear time dependent dissipative operator. Particular examples for the space Y are spaces of functions with various almost periodicity properties and more general types of asymptotic behavior. Further, an application to functional differential equations is given.
