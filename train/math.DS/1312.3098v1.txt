An \textit{algebraic} action of a discrete group \Gamma  is a homomorphism from \Gamma  to the group of continuous automorphisms of a compact abelian group X. By duality, such an action of \Gamma  is determined by a module M=\widehat{X} over the integer group ring \mathbb{Z}\Gamma  of \Gamma . The simplest examples of such modules are of the form M=\mathbb{Z}\Gamma /\mathbb{Z}\Gamma f with f\in \mathbb{Z}\Gamma ; the corresponding algebraic action is the \textit{principal algebraic \Gamma -action} \alpha _f defined by f.   In this note we prove the following extensions of results by Hayes \cite{Hayes} on ergodicity of principal algebraic actions: If \Gamma  is a countably infinite discrete group which is not virtually cyclic, and if f\in\mathbb{Z}\Gamma  satisfies that right multiplication by f on \ell ^2(\Gamma ,\mathbb{R}) is injective, then the principal \Gamma -action \alpha _f is ergodic (Theorem \ref{t:ergodic2}). If \Gamma  contains a finitely generated subgroup with a single end (e.g. a finitely generated amenable subgroup which is not virtually cyclic), or an infinite nonamenable subgroup with vanishing first \ell ^2-Betti number (e.g., an infinite property T subgroup), the injectivity condition on f can be replaced by the weaker hypothesis that f is not a right zero-divisor in \mathbb{Z}\Gamma  (Theorem \ref{t:ergodic1}). Finally, if \Gamma  is torsion-free, not virtually cyclic, and satisfies Linnell's \textit{analytic zero-divisor conjecture}, then \alpha _f is ergodic for every f\in \mathbb{Z}\Gamma  (Remark \ref{r:analytic zero divisor}).
