In this paper we consider Hausdorff dimension of the sets of Li-Yorke pairs for some chaotic dynamical systems including A-coupled expanding systems. We prove that Li-Yorke pairs of A- coupled-expanding system under some conditions have full hausdorff dimension on the invariant set. we generalize the result of [8] on the Hausdorff dimension of Li-Yorke pairs of dynamical systems topologically conjugate to the full shift and having a self-similar invariant set to the case of dynamical system conjugated to some kind of subshifts. And Hausdorff dimension of "chaotic invariant set" for some kind of A-coupled-expanding maps is shown.
