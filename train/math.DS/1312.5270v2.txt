Let (X,\mathcal{A}, \mu) be a probability measure space and let T_i, 1\leq i\leq H, be commuting invertible measure preserving transformations on this measure space. We prove the following pointwise results;   The averages   \frac{1}{N}\sum_{n=1}^N f_1(T_1^nx)f_2(T_2^nx)\cdots f_H(T_H^nx) converge a.e. for every function f_i \in L^{\infty}(\mu) .\\ As a consequence if T_i = T^i for 1\leq i \leq H where T is an invertible measure preserving transformation on (X, \mathcal{A}, \mu) then the averages   \frac{1}{N}\sum_{n=1}^N f_1(T^nx)f_2(T^{2n}x)...f_H(T^{Hn}x) converge a.e.   This solves a long open question on the pointwise convergence of nonconventional ergodic averages. For H=2 it provides another proof of J. Bourgain's a.e. double recurrence theorem.
