We say that a sequence of operators (T_n) possesses hereditarily hypercyclic subspaces along a sequence (n_k) if for any subsequence (m_k)\subset(n_k), the sequence (T_{m_k}) possesses a hypercyclic subspace. While so far no characterization of the existence of hypercyclic subspaces in the case of Fr\'{e}chet spaces is known, we succeed to obtain a characterization of sequences (T_n) possessing hereditarily hypercyclic subspaces along (n_k), under the assumption that the sequence (T_n) satisfies the Hypercyclicity Criterion along (n_k). We also obtain a characterization of operators possessing a hypercyclic subspace under the assumption that T satisfies the Frequent Hypercyclicity Criterion.
