We derive simplified normal forms for an area-preserving map in a neighbourhood of a degenerate resonant elliptic fixed point. Such fixed points appear in generic two-parameter families of area-preserving maps. We also derive a simplified normal form for a generic two-parametric unfolding. The normal forms are used to analyse bifurcations of n-periodic orbits. In particular, for n\ge6 we find regions of parameters where the normal form has "meandering'' invariant curves.
