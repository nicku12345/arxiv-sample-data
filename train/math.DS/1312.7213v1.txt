The well-known Jewett-Krieger's Theorem states that each ergodic system has a strictly ergodic model. Strengthening the model by requiring that it is strictly ergodic under some group actions, and building the connection of the new model with the convergence of pointwise non-conventional ergodic averages we prove that for an ergodic system (X,\X,\mu, T), d\in\N, f_1, \ldots, f_d \in L^{\infty}(\mu), %and any tempered F{\rm {\o}}lner sequence F_n of \Z^2, the averages \begin{equation*}   \frac{1}{N^2} \sum_{(n,m)\in F_N} f_1(T^nx)f_2(T^{n+m}x)\ldots f_d(T^{n+(d-1)m}x) \end{equation*} converge \mu a.e. We remark that the same method can be used to show the pointwise convergence of ergodic averages along cubes which was firstly proved by Assani and then extended to a general case by Chu and Franzikinakis.
