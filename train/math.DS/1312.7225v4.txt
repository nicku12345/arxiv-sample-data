The notion of metric entropy dimension is introduced to measure the complexity of entropy zero dynamical systems. For measure preserving systems, we define entropy dimension via the dimension of entropy generating sequences. This combinatorial approach provides us with a new insight to analyze the entropy zero systems. We also define the dimension set of a system to investigate the structure of the randomness of the factors of a system. The notion of a uniform dimension in the class of entropy zero systems is introduced as a generalization of a K-system in the case of positive entropy. We investigate the joinings among entropy zero systems and prove the disjointness property among entropy zero systems using the dimension sets. Given a topological system, we compare topological entropy dimension with metric entropy dimension.
