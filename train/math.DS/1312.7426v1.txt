We study relations between transitivity, mixing and periodic points on dendrites. We prove that when there is a point with dense orbit which is not an endpoint, then periodic points are dense and there is a terminal periodic decomposition (we provide an example of a dynamical system on a dendrite with dense endpoints satisfying this assumption). We also show that it may happen that all periodic points except one (and points with dense orbit) are contained in the (dense) set of endpoints. It may also happen that dynamical system is transitive but there is a unique periodic point, which in fact is the unique fixed point. We also prove that on almost meshed-continua (a class of continua containing topological graphs and dendrites with closed or countable set of endpoints), periodic points are dense if and only if they are dense for the map induced on the hyperspace of all nonempty compact subsets.
