In this paper, we prove the existence of a compact global attractor for the flow generated by equation      \frac{\partial u}{\partial t}(x,t)+u(x,t)= \int_{\mathbb{R}^{N}}J(x-y)(f( u(y,t))dy+ h, \quad h > 0, \quad x\in \mathbb{R}^{N}, \quad t\in\mathbb{R}_{+}    in the weight space L^{p}(\mathbb{R}^{N}, \rho). We also give uniform estimates on the size of the attractor and we exhibit a Lyapunov functional to the flow generated by this equation
