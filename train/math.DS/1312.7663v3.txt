Answering an open question affirmatively it is shown that every ergodic invariant measure of a mean equicontinuous (i.e. mean-L-stable) system has discrete spectrum. Dichotomy results related to mean equicontinuity and mean sensitivity are obtained when a dynamical system is transitive or minimal.   Localizing the notion of mean equicontinuity, notions of almost mean equicontinuity and almost Banach mean equicontinuity are introduced. It turns out that a system with the former property may have positive entropy and meanwhile a system with the later property must have zero entropy.
