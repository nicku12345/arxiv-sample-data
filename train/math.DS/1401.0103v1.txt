According to the long-memory principle appears in fractional-order dynamical systems, analysis of these systems is commonly more complicated than those described by nonlinear ordinary differential equations. Another difficulty is due to the fact that some classical tools such as the Lyapunov stability theorems cannot directly be applied to nonlinear fractional differential systems. The aim of this paper is to study the stability of a general form of the two-dimensional fractional-order Lotka-Volterra equation and numerically investigate the domain of attraction of its stable equilibrium points. It is also shown that the fractional-order Lotka-Volterra system can never have a stable focus although the linearized system has complex conjugate modes. Some other properties of the fractional-order Lotka-Volterra equation, which are not observed in integer-order case, are also discussed.
