In this work we consider the non local evolution equation with time-dependent terms which arises in models of phase separation in \mathbb{R}^N \[ \partial_t u=- u + g \left(\beta(J*u) +\beta h(t,u)\right) \] under some restrictions on h, growth restrictions on the nonlinear term g and \beta>1. We prove, under suitable assumptions, existence, regularity and upper-semicontinuity of pullback attractors with respect to functional parameter h(t) in some weighted spaces.
