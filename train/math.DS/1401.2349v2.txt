The concept of A-coupled-expanding map, which is one of the more natural and useful ideas generalized the horseshoe map, is well known as a criterion of chaos. It is well known that distributional chaos is one of the concepts which reflect strong chaotic behaviour. In this paper, we focus the relations between A-coupled-expanding and distributional chaos. We prove two theorems that give sufficient conditions for a strictly A-coupled-expanding map to be distributionally chaotic in the senses of two kinds, where A is an irreducible transition matrix.
