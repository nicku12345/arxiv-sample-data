We consider some nonuniformly hyperbolic invertible dynamical systems which are modeled by a Gibbs-Markov-Young tower. We assume a polynomial tail for the inducing time and a polynomial control of hyperbolicity, as introduced by Alves, Pinheiro and Azevedo. These systems admit a physical measure with polynomial rate of mixing. In this paper we prove that the distribution of the number of visits to a ball B(x, r) converges to a Poisson distribution as the radius r \to 0 and after suitable normalization.
