Let \mathcal G_2 denote the affine group GL(2,\mathbb Z) \ltimes \mathbb Z^{2}. For every point x=(x_1,x_2) \in \R2 let \orb(x)=\{y\in\R2\mid y=\gamma(x) for some \gamma \in \mathcal{G}_2 \}. Let G_{x} be the subgroup of the additive group \mathbb R generated by x_1,x_2, 1. If \rank(G_x)\in \{1,3\} then \orb(x)=\{y\in\R2\mid G_y=G_x\}. If \rank(G_x)=2, knowledge of G_x is not sufficient in general to uniquely recover \orb(x): rather, G_x classifies precisely \max(1,\phi(d)/2) different orbits, where d is the denominator of the smallest positive nonzero rational in G_x and \phi is Euler function. To get a complete classification, polyhedral geometry provides an integer c_x\geq 1 such that \orb(y)=\orb(x)  iff (G_{x},c_{x})=(G_{y},c_{{y}}).
