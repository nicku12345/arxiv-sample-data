We investigate the set V_f of horizontal critical points of a polynomial function f for the standard Engel structure defined by the 1-forms \omega_3=dx_3-x_1dx_2, \omega_4=dx_4-x_3dx_2, endowed with the sub-Riemannian metric g_{SR}=dx_1^2+dx_2^2. For a generic polynomial, we show that the intersection of any fiber of f and V_f does not contain a horizontal curve. Then we prove that each trajectory of the horizontal gradient of f approaching the set V_f has a limit.
