We study the accumulation of an elliptic fixed point of a real analytic Hamiltonian by quasi-periodic invariant tori. We show that a fixed point with Diophantine frequency vector \o_0 is always accumulated by invariant complex analytic KAM-tori. Indeed, the following alternative holds: If the Birkhoff normal form of the Hamiltonian at the invariant point satisfies a R\"ussmann transversality condition, the fixed point is accumulated by real analytic KAM-tori which cover positive Lebesgue measure in the phase space (in this part it suffices to assume that \o_0 has rationally independent coordinates). If the Birkhoff normal form is degenerate, there exists an analytic subvariety of complex dimension at least d+1 passing through 0 that is foliated by complex analytic KAM-tori with frequency \omega_0. This is an extension of previous results obtained in \cite{EFK} to the case of an elliptic fixed point.
