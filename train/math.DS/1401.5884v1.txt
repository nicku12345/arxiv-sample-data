We prove that if for the curved n-body problem in \mathbb{S}^{k-1}, k\geq 3, the masses are given, the minimum distance between the point masses of a specific type of relative equilibrium solution that is a generalisation of positive elliptic relative equilibria and positive elliptic-elliptic relative equilibria has a universal lower bound that is not equal to zero.
