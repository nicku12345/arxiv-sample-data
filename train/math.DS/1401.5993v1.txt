Some errors contained in the author's previous article "An example of Bautin-type bifurcation in a delay differential equation", JMAA, 329(2007), 777-789, are listed and corrected.   Original abstract: In a previous paper we gave sufficient conditions for a system of delay differential equations to present Bautin-type bifurcation. In the present work we present an example of delay equation that satisfies these conditions.
