Given an integer N\ge 2 and a real number {\beta}>1, let \Gamma_{{\beta},N} be the set of all x=\sum_{i=1}^\infty {d_i}/{{\beta}^i} with d_i\in\{0,1,\cdots,N-1\} for all i\ge 1. The infinite sequence (d_i) is called a {\beta}-expansion of x. Let \mathbf{U}_{{\beta},N} be the set of all x's in \Gamma_{{\beta},N} which have unique {\beta}-expansions. We give explicit formula of the Hausdorff dimension of \mathbf{U}_{{\beta},N} for {\beta} in any admissible interval [{{\beta}}_L,{{\beta}}_U], where {{\beta}_L} is a purely Parry number while {{\beta}_U} is a transcendental number whose quasi-greedy expansion of 1 is related to the classical Thue-Morse sequence. This allows us to calculate the Hausdorff dimension of \U{N} for almost every \beta>1. In particular, this improves the main results of G{\'a}bor Kall{\'o}s (1999, 2001). Moreover, we find that the dimension function f({\beta})=\dim_H\mathbf{U}_{{\beta},N} fluctuates frequently for {\beta}\in(1,N).
