In the present paper we want to focus on this dichotomy of the non-normal numbers -- on the one hand they are a set of measure zero and on the other hand they are residual -- for dynamical system fulfilling the specification property. These dynamical systems are motivated by \beta-expansions. We consider the limiting frequencies of digits in the words of the languagse arising from these dynamical systems, and show that not only a typical x in the sense of Baire is non-normal, but also its Ces\`aro variants diverge.
