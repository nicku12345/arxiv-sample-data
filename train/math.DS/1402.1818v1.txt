We study the rich behavior of ergodicity and conservativity of Cartesian products of infinite measure preserving transformations. A class of transformations is constructed such that for any subset R\subset \mathbb Q\cap (0,1) there exists T in this class such that T^p\times T^q is ergodic if and only if \frac{p}{q} \in R. This contrasts with the finite measure preserving case where T^p\times T^q is ergodic for all nonzero p and q if and only if T\times T is ergodic. We also show that our class is rich in the behavior of conservative products.   For each positive integer k, a family of rank-one infinite measure preserving transformations is constructed which have ergodic index k, but infinite conservative index.
