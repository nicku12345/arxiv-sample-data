We prove that large global systems of interacting (non necessarily similar) dynamical units that are coupled by cooperative impulses, recurrently exhibit the so called grand coalition, for which all the units arrive to their respective goals simultaneously. We bound from above the waiting time until the first grand coalition appears. Finally, we prove that if besides the units are mutually similar, then the grand coalition is the unique subset of goal-synchronized units that is recurrently shown by the global dynamics.
