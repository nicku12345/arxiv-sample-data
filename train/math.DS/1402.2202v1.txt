We revisit the visible points of a lattice in Euclidean n-space together with their generalisations, the kth-power-free points of a lattice, and study the corresponding dynamical system that arises via the closure of the lattice translation orbit. Our analysis extends previous results obtained by Sarnak and by Cellarosi and Sinai for the special case of square-free integers and sheds new light on previous joint work with Peter Pleasants.
