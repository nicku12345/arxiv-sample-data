It is often the case that a covering map of the open annulus is semiconjugate to a map of the circle of the same degree. We investigate this possibility and its consequences on the dynamics. In particular, we address the problem of the classification up to conjugacy. However, there are examples which are not semiconjugate to a map of the circle, and this opens new questions.
