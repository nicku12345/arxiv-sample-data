In this paper by using of generalized groups and their generalized actions, we define and study the notion of T-spaces. Moreover, we study properties of the quotient space of a T-space and we present the conditions that imply to the Hausdorff property for it. Moreover, we study the maps between two T-spaces and we consider the notion of T-transitivity.
