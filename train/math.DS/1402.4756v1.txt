For a family (F_{t,a} : x \mapsto x + t + a\phi(x)) of increasing homeomorphisms of \mathbb R with \phi being Lipschitz continuous of period 1, there is a parameter space consisting of the values (t,a) such that the map F_{t,a} is strictly increasing and it induces an orientation preserving circle homeomorphism. For each \theta \in \mathbb R there is an \textsf{Arnol'd tongue} \mathcal T_\theta of \textsf{translation number} \theta in the parameter space. Given a rational p/q, it is shown that the boundary \partial \mathcal T_{p/q} is a union of two Lipschitz curves which intersect at a=0 and there can be a non zero angle between them. In this direction we compute the first order asymptotic expansion of the boundaries of the rational and irrational tongues in the parameter space around a=0.   For the standard family (S_{t,a} : x \mapsto x + t + a \sin(2\pi x)), the boundary curves of \mathcal T_{p/q} have the same tangency at a=0 for q\ge 2 and it is known that q is their \textsf{order of contact}. Using the techniques of \textsf{guided} and \textsf{admissible family}, we give a new proof of this. In particular we relate this to the \textsf{parabolic multiplicity} of the map s_{p/q} : z \mapsto e^{i2\pi p/q}ze^{\pi z} at 0.
