We consider a class of piecewise hyperbolic maps from the unit square to itself preserving a contracting foliation and inducing a piecewise expanding quotient map, with infinite derivative (like the first return maps of Lorenz like flows). We show how the physical measure of those systems can be rigorously approximated with an explicitly given bound on the error, with respect to the Wasserstein distance. We apply this to the rigorous computation of the dimension of the measure. We present a rigorous implementation of the algorithms using interval arithmetics, and the result of the computation on a nontrivial example of Lorenz like map and its attractor, obtaining a statement on its local dimension.
