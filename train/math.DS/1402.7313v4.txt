For, 0<\lambda<1, consider the transformation T(x) = d x  (mod 1) on the circle S^1, a C^1 function A:S^1 \to \mathbb{R}, and, the map F(x,s) = ( T(x) , \lambda \, s + A(x)), (x,s)\in S^1 \times \mathbb{R}. We denote \mathcal{B}= \mathcal{B}_\lambda the upper boundary of the attractor (known as fat attractor). We are interested in the regularity of \mathcal{B}_\lambda, and, also in what happens in the limit when \lambda\to 1. We also address the analysis of the following conjecture which were proposed by R. Bam\'on, J. Kiwi, J. Rivera-Letelier and R. Urz\'ua: for any fixed \lambda, C^1 generically on the potential A, the upper boundary \mathcal{B}_\lambda is formed by a finite number of pieces of smooth unstable manifolds of periodic orbits for F. We show the proof of the conjecture for the class of C^2 potentials A(x) satisfying the twist condition (plus a combinatorial condition). We do not need the generic hypothesis for this result. We present explicit examples. On the other hand, when \lambda is close to 1 and the potential A is generic a more precise description can be done. In this case the finite number of pieces of C^1 curves on the boundary have some special properties. Having a finite number of pieces on this boundary is an important issue in a problem related to semi-classical limits and micro-support. This was consider in a recent published work by A. Lopes and J. Mohr. Finally, we present the general analysis of the case where A is Lipschitz and its relation with Ergodic Transport
