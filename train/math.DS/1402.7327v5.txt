We define weaker forms of topological and measure theoretical equicontinuity for topological dynamical systems and we study their relationships with systems with discrete spectrum and zero sequence entropy. In the topological category we show systems with zero topological sequence entropy are strictly contained in the diam-mean equicontinuous systems; and that transitive almost automorphic subshifts are diam-mean equicontinuous if and only if they are regular (i.e. the maximal equicontinuous factor map is 1-1 on a set of full Haar measure). In the measure category we show that for ergodic topological systems having discrete spectrum is equivalent of being {\mu}-mean equicontinuous. For both categories we find characterizations using stronger versions of the classical notion of sensitivity.
