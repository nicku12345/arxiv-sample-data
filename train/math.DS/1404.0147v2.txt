We consider quenched random perturbations of skew products of rotations on the unit circle over uniformly expanding maps on the unit circle. It is known that if the skew product satisfies a certain condition (shown to be generic in the case of linear expanding maps), then the transfer operator of the skew product has a spectral gap. Using semiclassical analysis we show that the spectral gap is preserved under small random perturbations. This implies exponential decay of quenched random correlation functions for smooth observables at small noise levels.
