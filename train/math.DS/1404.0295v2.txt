In this paper we study the distribution of hitting and return times for observations of dynamical systems. We apply this results to get an exponential law for the distribution of hitting and return times for rapidly mixing random dynamical systems. In particular, it allows us to obtain an exponential law for random expanding maps, random circle maps expanding in average and randomly perturbed dynamical systems.
