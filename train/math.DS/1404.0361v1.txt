1. We answer Michael Gordin's question providing singular spectrum for transformations with homoclinic Bernoulli flows via Poisson suspensions induced by modified Sidon rank-one constructions.   2. We give homoclinic proof of Emmanuel Roy's theorem on multiple mixing of Poisson suspensions, adding new examples to Jonathan King's ergodic homoclinic groups of special zero-entropy transformations.   3. Sasha Prikhod'ko found the fast decay of correlations for some iceberg automorphisms. We get similar correlations for a class of infinite rank-one Sidon transformations.   This version is based on "On Mixing Rank One Infinite Transformations" arXiv:1106.4655
