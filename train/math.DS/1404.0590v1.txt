Let X be a compact metric space and let |A| denote the cardinality of a set A. We prove that if f\colon X\to X is a homeomorphism and |X|=\infty then for all \delta>0 there is A\subset X such that |A|=4 and for all k\in Z there are x,y\in f^k(A), x\neq y, such that dist(x,y)<\delta. An observer that can only distinguish two points if their distance is grater than \delta, for sure will say that A has at most 3 points even knowing every iterate of A and that f is a homeomorphism. We show that for hyper-expansive homeomorphisms the same \delta-observer will not fail about the cardinality of A if we start with |A|=3 instead of 4. Generalizations of this problem are considered via what we call (m,n)-expansiveness.
