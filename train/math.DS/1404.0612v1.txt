We characterize the values of the parameters for which a zero--Hopf equilibrium point takes place at the singular points, namely, O (the origin), P_+ and P_- in the FitzHugh-Nagumo system. Thus we find two 2--parameter families of the FitzHugh-Nagumo system for which the equilibrium point at the origin is a zero-Hopf equilibrium. For these two families we prove the existence of a periodic orbit bifurcating from the zero--Hopf equilibrium point O. We prove that exist three 2--parameter families of the FitzHugh-Nagumo system for which the equilibrium point at P_+ and P_- is a zero-Hopf equilibrium point. For one of these families we prove the existence of 1, or 2, or 3 periodic orbits borning at P_+ and P_-.
