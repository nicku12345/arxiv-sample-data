A zero-Hopf equilibrium is an isolated equilibrium point whose eigenvalues are \pm \omega i\neq 0 and 0. In general for a such equilibrium there is no theory for knowing when from it bifurcates some small-amplitude limit cycle moving the parameters of the system. Here we study the zero-Hopf bifurcation using the averaging theory. We apply this theory to a Chua system depending on 6 parameters, but the way followed for studying the zero-Hopf bifurcation can be applied to any other differential system in dimension 3 or higher.   In this paper first we show that there are three 4-parameter families of Chua systems exhibiting a zero-Hopf equilibrium. After, by using the averaging theory, we provide sufficient conditions for the bifurcation of limit cycles from these families of zero-Hopf equilibria. From one family we can prove that 1 limit cycle bifurcate, and from the other two families we can prove that 1, 2 or 3 limit cycles bifurcate simultaneously.
