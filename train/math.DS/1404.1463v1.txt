The present note refers to a result proposed in [Elhadj and Sprott, 2012], and shows that the Theorem therein is not correct. We explain that a proof of that Theorem cannot be given, as the statement is not correct, and we underline a mistake occurring in their proof.   Since this note is supplementary to [Elhadj and Sprott, 2012], the reader should consult this paper for further explanations of the matter and the symbols used.
