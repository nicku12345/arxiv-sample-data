Let f: \mathbb{T}^3\to\mathbb{T}^3 be a partially hyperbolic diffeomorphism on the 3-torus \mathbb{T}^3. In his thesis, Hammerlindl proved that for lifted center foliation \mathcal{F}^c_f, there exists R>0, such that for any x\in \mathbb{R}^3, {\cal F}^c_f(x)\subset B_R (x+E^c), where \mathbb{R}^3=E^s\oplus E^c\oplus E^u is the partially hyperbolic splitting of the linear model of f. The same is true for the lifted center-stable and center-unstable foliations. Then he asked if the this property is true for strong stable and strong unstable foliations. In this note, we give a negative answer to Hammerlindl's question.
