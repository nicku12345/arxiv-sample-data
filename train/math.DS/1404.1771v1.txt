We study the rate of convergence to zero of the tail entropy of C^\infty maps. We give an upper bound of this rate in terms of the growth in k of the derivative of order k and give examples showing the optimality of the established rate of convergence. We also consider the case of multimodal maps of the interval. Finally we prove that homoclinic tangencies give rise to C^r (r\geq 2) robustly non h-expansive dynamical systems.
