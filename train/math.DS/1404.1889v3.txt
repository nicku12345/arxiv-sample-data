Let b\geq 2 be an integer and \hv a real number. Among other results, we compute the Hausdorff dimension of the set of real numbers \xi with the property that, for every sufficiently large integer N, there exists an integer n such that 1 \le n \le N and the distance between b^n \xi and its nearest integer is at most equal to b^{-\hv N}. We further solve the same question when replacing b^n\xi by T^n_\beta \xi, where T_\beta denotes the classical \beta-transformation.
