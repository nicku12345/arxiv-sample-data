We will give an example of a smooth free action of S^1=U(1) on S^7 whose orbits have unbounded lenghts (equivalently: unbounded periods). As an application of this example we construct a C^{\infty} vector field X, defined in a neighbourhood U of 0 \in \mathbb{R}^8, such that: U-\{0\} is foliated by closed integral curves of X, the differential DX(0) at 0 defines a 1-parameter group of nondegenerate rotations and X is {\it not} orbitally equivalent to its linearization. This proves in the C^{\infty} category that the classical Poincar\'e Centre Theorem, true for planar nondegenerate centres, is not generalizable to multicentres.
