We give a fairly complete characterization of the exact components of a large class of uniformly expanding Markov maps of \mathbb{R}. Using this result, for a class of \mathbb{Z}-invariant maps and finite modifications thereof, we prove certain properties of infinite mixing recently introduced by the author.
