We consider a finite but arbitrarily large Klein-Gordon chain, with periodic boundary conditions. In the limit of small couplings in the nearest neighbor interaction, and small (total or specific) energy, a high order resonant normal form is constructed with estimates uniform in the number of degrees of freedom. In particular, the first order normal form is a generalized discrete nonlinear Schroedinger model, characterized by all-to-all sites coupling with exponentially decaying strength.
