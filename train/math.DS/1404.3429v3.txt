We are interested in the following differential equation \ddot u(t) = -A u(t) - c A \dot u(t) + \lambda u(t) + F(u(t)) where c > 0 is a damping factor, A is a sectorial operator and F is a continuous map. We consider the situation where the equation is at resonance at infinity, which means that \lambda is an eigenvalue of A and F is a bounded map. We provide geometrical conditions for the nonlinearity F and determine the Conley index of the set K_\infty, that is the union of the bounded orbits of this equation.
