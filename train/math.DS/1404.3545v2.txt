We call that a vector field has the oriented shadowing property if for any \varepsilon>0 there is d>0 such that each d-pseudo orbit is \varepsilon-oriented shadowed by some real orbit. In this paper, we show that the C^1-interior of the set of vector fields with the oriented shadowing property is contained in the set of vector fields with the \Omega-stability.
