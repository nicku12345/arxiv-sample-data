Inou and Shishikura provided a class of maps that is invariant by near-parabolic renormalization, and that has proved extremely useful in the study of the dynamics of quadratic polynomials. We provide here another construction, using more general arguments. This will allow to extend the range of applications to unicritical polynomials of all degrees.
