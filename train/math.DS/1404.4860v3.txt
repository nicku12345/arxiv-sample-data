Given an arbitrary continuous flow on a manifold M, let CMin be the set of its compact minimal sets, endowed with the Hausdorff metric, and S the subset of those that are Lyapunov stable. A topological characterization of the interior of S, the set of Lyapunov stable compact minimal sets that are away from Lyapunov unstable ones is given, together with a description of the dynamics around it. In particular, int S is locally a Peano continuum (Peano curve) and each of its countably many connected components admits a complete geodesic metric.   This result establishes unexpected connections between the local topology of CMin and the dynamics of the flow, providing criteria for the local detection of Lyapunov instability by merely looking at the topology of CMin. For instance, if CMin is not locally connected at some compact minimal set Q (seen as a "point" of CMin), then every neighbourhood of Q in M contains Lyapunov unstable compact minimal sets (hence, if CMin is nowhere locally connected, then every neighbourhood of each compact minimal set contains infinitely many Lyapunov unstable compact minimal sets).
