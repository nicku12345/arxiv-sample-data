In a recent paper, Melbourne and Terhesiu [Operator renewal theory and mixing rates for dynamical systems with infinite measure, Invent. Math. 189 (2012), 61-110] obtained results on mixing and mixing rates for a large class of noninvertible maps preserving an infinite ergodic invariant measure.   Here, we are concerned with extending these results to the invertible setting. Mixing is established for a large class of infinite measure invertible maps. Assuming additional structure, in particular exponential contraction along stable manifolds, it is possible to obtain good results on mixing rates and higher order asymptotics.
