In this paper we discuss some connections between measurable dynamics and rigidity aspects of group representations and group actions. A new ergodic feature of familiar group boundaries is introduced, and is used to obtain rigidity results for group representations and to prove simplicity of Lyapunov exponents for some dynamical systems.
