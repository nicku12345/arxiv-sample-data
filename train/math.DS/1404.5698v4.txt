For a rank one Lie group G and a Zariski dense and geometrically finite subgroup \Gamma of G, we establish equidistribution of holonomy classes about closed geodesics for the associated locally symmetric space. Our result is given in a quantitative form for real hyperbolic geometrically finite manifolds whose critical exponents are big enough. In the case when G=PSL(2, C), our results can be interpreted as the equidistribution of eigenvalues of \Gamma in the complex plane.   When \Gamma is a lattice, this result was proved by Sarnak and Wakayama in 1999.
