The Nevo-Zimmer theorem classifies the possible intermediate G-factors Y in X \times G/P \to Y \to X, where G is a higher rank semisimple Lie group, P a minimal parabolic and X an irreducible G-space with an invariant probability measure.   An important corollary is the Stuck-Zimmer theorem, which states that a faithful irreducible action of a higher rank Kazhdan semisimple Lie group with an invariant probability measure is either transitive or free, up to a null set.   We present a different proof of the first theorem, that allows us to extend these two well-known theorems to linear groups over arbitrary local fields.
