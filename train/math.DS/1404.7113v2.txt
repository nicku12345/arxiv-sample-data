We show an elementary method to have (finite time and asymptotic) computer assisted explicit upper bounds on convergence to equilibrium (decay of correlations) and escape rate for systems satisfying a Lasota Yorke inequality. The bounds are deduced by the ones of suitable approximations of the system's transfer operator. We also present some rigorous experiment showing the approach and some concrete result.
