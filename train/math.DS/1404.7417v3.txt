We study critical orbits and bifurcations within the moduli space of quadratic rational maps on \mathbb{P}^1. We focus on the family of curves, Per_1(\lambda) for \lambda in \mathbb{C}, defined by the condition that each f\in Per_1(\lambda) has a fixed point of multiplier \lambda. We prove that the curve Per_1(\lambda) contains infinitely many postcritically-finite maps if and only if \lambda = 0; addressing a special case of [BD2, Conjecture 1.4]. We also show that the two critical points of a map f define distinct bifurcation measures along Per_1(\lambda).
