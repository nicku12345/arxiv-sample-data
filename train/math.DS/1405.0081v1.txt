Let f be a partially hyperbolic diffeomorphism. f is called has the quasi-shadowing property if for any pseudo orbit \{x_k\}_{k\in \mathbb{Z}}, there is a sequence \{y_k\}_{k\in \mathbb{Z}} tracing it in which y_{k+1} lies in the local center leaf of f(y_k) for any k\in \mathbb{Z}. f is called topologically quasi-stable if for any homeomorphism g C^0-close to f, there exist a continuous map \pi and a motion \tau along the center foliation such that \pi\circ g=\tau\circ f\circ\pi. In this paper we prove that if f is dynamically coherent then it has quasi-shadowing and topological quasi-stability properties.
