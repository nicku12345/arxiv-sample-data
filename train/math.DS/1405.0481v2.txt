For an integer m \geq 2, let \mathcal{P}_m be the partition of the unit interval I into m equal subintervals, and let \mathcal{F}_m be the class of piecewise linear maps on I with constant slope \pm m on each element of \mathcal{P}_m. We investigate the effect on mixing properties when f \in \mathcal{F}_m is composed with the interval exchange map given by a permutation \sigma \in S_N interchanging the N subintervals of \mathcal{P}_N. This extends the work in a previous paper [N.P. Byott, M. Holland and Y. Zhang, DCDS, {\bf 33}, (2013) 3365--3390], where we considered only the "stretch-and-fold" map f_{sf}(x)=mx \bmod 1.
