It is well known that, the existence of a Lyapunov function is a sufficient condition for stability, asymptotic stability, or global asymptotic stability of an equilibrium point of an autonomous system \dot{\mathbf{x}} = f(\mathbf{x}). In variants of Lyapunov theorems, the condition for a Lyapunov candidate V (continuously differentiable and positive definite function) to be a Lyapunov function is that its time derivative along system trajectories must be negative semi-definite or negative definite. Numerically checking positive definiteness of V is very difficult; checking negative definiteness of \dot{V}(\cdot)=\langle \nabla V(\cdot), f(\cdot) \rangle is even more difficult, because it involves dynamics of the system.   We give a necessary condition independent of the system dynamics, for every Lyapunov function corresponding to the globally asymptotically stable equilibrium point of \dot{\mathbf{x}} = f(\mathbf{x}). This necessary condition is numerically easier to check than checking positive definiteness of a function. Therefore, it can be used as a first level test to check whether a given continuously differentiable function is a Lyapunov function candidate or not. We also propose a method, which we call a generalized steepest descent method, to check this condition numerically. Generalized steepest descent method can be used for ruling out Lyapunov candidates corresponding to the globally asymptotically stable equilibrium point of \dot{\mathbf{x}} = f(\mathbf{x}). It can also be used as a heuristic to check the local positive definiteness of a function, which is a necessary condition for a Lyapunov function corresponding to a stable and/or asymptotically stable equilibrium point of an autonomous system.
