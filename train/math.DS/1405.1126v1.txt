This paper is concerned with the traveling wave solutions and asymptotic spreading of delayed lattice differential equations without quasimonotonicity. The spreading speed is obtained by constructing auxiliary equations and using the theory of lattice differential equations without time delay. The minimal wave speed of invasion traveling wave solutions is established by presenting the existence and nonexistence of traveling wave solutions.
