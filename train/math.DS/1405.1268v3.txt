The aim of this paper is to prove a Kolmogorov-type result for a nearly-integrable Hamiltonian, quadratic in the actions, with an aperiodic time dependence. The existence of a torus with a prefixed Diophantine frequency is shown in the forced system, provided that the perturbation is real-analytic and (exponentially) decaying with time. The advantage consists of the possibility to choose an arbitrarily small decaying coefficient, consistently with the perturbation size.
