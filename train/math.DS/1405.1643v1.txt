We consider the family of quadratic H\'enon diffeomorphisms of the plane {\bf R}^2. A map will be said to be a "horseshoe" if its restriction to the nonwandering set is hyperbolic and conjugate to the full 2-shift. We give a criterion for being a horseshoe based on an auxiliary coding which describes positions of points relative to the stable manifold of one of the fixed points. In addition we describe the topological conjugacy type of maps on the boundary of the horseshoe locus. We use complex techniques and we work with maps in a parameter region which is a 2-D analog of the familiar "{1\over 2}-wake" for the quadratic family p_c(z) = z^2.
