Let \Gamma be a lattice of a semisimple Lie group L. Suppose that one parameter Ad-diagonalizable subgroup \{g_t\} of L acts ergodically on L/\Gamma with respect to the probability Haar measure \mu. For certain proper subgroup U of the unstable horospherical subgroup of \{g_t\} we show that given x\in L/\Gamma for almost every u\in U the trajectory \{g_tux: 0\le t\le T\} is uniformly distributed with respect to \mu as T\to \infty.
