It is well-known that any \mathbb{Z} subshift with the specification property has the property that every factor is intrinsically ergodic, i.e., every factor has a unique factor of maximal entropy. In recent work, other \mathbb{Z} subshifts have been shown to possess this property as well, including \beta-shifts and a class of S-gap shifts. We give two results that show that the situation for \mathbb{Z}^d subshifts with d >1  is quite different. First, for any d>1, we show that any \mathbb{Z}^d subshift possessing a certain mixing property must have a factor with positive entropy which is not intrinsically ergodic. In particular, this shows that for d>1, \mathbb{Z}^d subshifts with specification cannot have all factors intrinsically ergodic. We also give an example of a \mathbb{Z}^2 shift of finite type, introduced by Hochman, which is not even topologically mixing, but for which every positive entropy factor is intrinsically ergodic.
