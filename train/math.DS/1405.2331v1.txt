Let G be connected nilpotent Lie group acting locally on a real surface M. Let \varphi be the local flow on M induced by a 1-parameter subgroup. Assume K is a compact set of fixed points of \varphi and U is a neighborhood of K containing no other fixed points.   Theorem: If the Dold fixed-point index of \varphi_t|U is nonzero for sufficiently small t>0, then {\rm Fix} (G) \cap K \ne \emptyset.
