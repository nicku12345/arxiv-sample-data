We give necessary integral conditions and sufficient ones for the existence of a general concept of \mu-dichotomy for evolution operators defined on the half-line which includes as particular cases the well-known concepts of nonuniform exponential dichotomy and nonuniform polynomial dichotomy, and also contains new situations. Additionally, we consider an adapted notion of Lyapunov function and use our results to obtain necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of nonuniform \mu-dichotomies using these Lyapunov functions.
