Model sets are always Meyer sets but the converse is generally not true. In this work we show that for a repetitive Meyer multiple sets of \mathbb{R}^d with associated dynamical system (\mathbb{X}, \mathbb{R}^d), the property of being a model multiple set is equivalent for (\mathbb{X}, \mathbb{R}^d) to be almost automorphic. We deduce this by showing that a repetitive Meyer multiple set can always be embedded into a repetitive model multiple set having a smaller group of topological eigenvalues.
