In this paper, the successive approximation method is applied to investigate the existence and uniqueness of solutions to the stochastic differential equations (SDEs) driven by L\'evy noise under non-Lipschitz condition which is a much weaker condition than Lipschiz one. The stability of the solutions to non-Lipschitz SDEs driven by L\'evy noise is also considered, and the stochastic stability is obtained in the sense of mean square.
