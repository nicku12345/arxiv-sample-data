For an ergodic probability-measure-preserving action G \curvearrowright (X, \mu) of a countable group G, we define the Rokhlin entropy h_G^{\mathrm{Rok}}(X, \mu) to be the infimum of the Shannon entropies of countable generating partitions. It is known that for free ergodic actions of amenable groups this notion coincides with classical Kolmogorov--Sinai entropy. It is thus natural to view Rokhlin entropy as a close analogue to classical entropy. Under this analogy we prove that Krieger's finite generator theorem holds for all countably infinite groups. Specifically, if h_G^{\mathrm{Rok}}(X, \mu) < \log(k) then there exists a generating partition consisting of k sets.
