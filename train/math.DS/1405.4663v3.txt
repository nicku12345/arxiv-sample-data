Given a family \{ f_{\lambda} \}_{\lambda \in \Lambda} of polynomial maps of degree d where \Lambda is the set of parameters, a polynomial map f_{\lambda_0} is called {\it J-stable in \Lambda} if there exists a neighborhood of \lambda_0 in \Lambda such that for any element \lambda in the neighborhood, there exists a conjugacy between the dynamics on the Julia sets of f_\lambda and f_{\lambda_0}. The aim of this paper is to show that a polynomial map f_{\lambda_0} over the field \mathbb{C}_p of p-adic complex numbers is J-stable in the family of polynomial maps over \mathbb{C}_p if f_{\lambda_0} is {\it immediately expanding}.
