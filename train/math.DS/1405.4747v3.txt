We investigate from a multifractal analysis point of view the increasing rate of the sums of partial quotients S\_n(x)=\sum\_{j=1}^n a\_j(x), where x=[a\_1(x), a\_2(x), \cdots ] is the continued fraction expansion of an irrational x\in (0,1). Precisely, for an increasing function \varphi: \mathbb{N} \rightarrow \mathbb{N}, one is interested in the Hausdorff dimension of the sets\[E\_\varphi = \left\{x\in (0,1): \lim\_{n\to\infty} \frac {S\_n(x)} {\varphi(n)} =1\right\}.\]Several cases are solved by Iommi and Jordan, Wu and Xu, and Xu. We attack the remaining subexponential case \exp(n^\gamma), \ \gamma \in [1/2, 1). We show that when \gamma \in [1/2, 1), E\_\varphi has Hausdorff dimension 1/2. Thus, surprisingly, the dimension has a jump from 1 to 1/2 at \varphi(n)=\exp(n^{1/2}). In a similar way, the distribution of the largest partial quotient is also studied.
