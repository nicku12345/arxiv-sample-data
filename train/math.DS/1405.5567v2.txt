Following ideas of Arnold and Seigal-Yakovenko, we prove that the space of matrix coefficients of a formal Lie group action belongs to a Noetherian ring. Using this result we extend the uniform intersection multiplicity estimates of these authors from the abelian case to general Lie groups. We also demonstrate a simple new proof for a jet-determination result of Baouendi et. al.   In the second part of the paper we use similar ideas to prove a result on embedding formal diffeomorphisms in one-parameter groups extending a result of Takens. In particular this implies that the results of Arnold and Seigal-Yakovenko are formal consequence of our result for Lie groups.
