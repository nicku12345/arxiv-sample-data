We develop the reducing multiplier theory for a special class of nonholonomic dynamical systems and show that the non-linear Poisson brackets naturally obtained in the framework of this approach are all isomorphic to the Lie-Poisson e(3)-bracket. As two model examples, we consider the Chaplygin ball problem on the plane and the Veselova system. In particular, we obtain an integrable gyrostatic generalisation of the Veselova system.
