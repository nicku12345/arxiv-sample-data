In ergodic theory, given sufficient conditions on the system, every weak mixing \mathbb{N}-action is strong mixing along a density one subset of \mathbb{N}. We ask if a similar statement holds in topological dynamics with density one replaced with thickness. We show that given sufficient initial conditions, a group action in topological dynamics is strong mixing on a thick subset of the group if and only if the system is k-transitive for all k, and conclude that an analogue of this statement from ergodic theory holds in topological dynamics when dealing with abelian groups.
