Consider the skew product F:\mathbb{T}^2 \to \mathbb{T}^2, F(x,y)= (f(x),y+\tau(x)), where f:\mathbb{T}^1\to \mathbb{T}^1 is a piecewise \mathscr{C}^{1+\alpha} expanding map on a countable partition and \tau:\mathbb{T}^1 \to \mathbb{R} is piecewise \mathscr{C}^1. It is shown that if \tau is not Lipschitz-cohomologous to a piecewise constant function on the joint partition of \tau and f, then F is mixing at a stretched-exponential rate.
