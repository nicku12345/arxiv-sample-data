We consider the skew product F: (x,u) \mapsto (f(x), u + \tau(x)), where the base map f : \mathbb{T}^{1} \to \mathbb{T}^{1} is piecewise \mathcal{C}^{2}, covering and uniformly expanding, and the fibre map \tau : \mathbb{T}^{1} \to \mathbb{R} is piecewise \mathcal{C}^{2}. We show the dichotomy that either this system mixes exponentially or \tau is cohomologous (via a Lipschitz function) to a piecewise constant.
