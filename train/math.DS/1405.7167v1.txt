Let f_c(x) = 1 - cx^2 be a one-parameter family of real continuous maps with parameter c \ge 0. For every positive integer n, let N_n denote the number of parameters c such that the point x = 0 is a (superstable) periodic point of f_c(x) whose least period divides n (in particular, f_c^n(0) = 0). In this note, we find a recursive way to depict how {\it some} of these parameters c appear in the interval [0, 2] and show that \liminf_{n \to \infty} (\log N_n)/n \ge \log 2 and this result is generalized to a class of one-parameter families of continuous real-valued maps that includes the family f_c(x) = 1 - cx^2.
