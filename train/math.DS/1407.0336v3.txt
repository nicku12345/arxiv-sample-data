In the present paper we give a positive answer to a question posed by Viana on the existence of positive Lyapunov exponents for symplectic cocycles. Actually, we prove that for an open and dense set of Holder symplectic cocycles over a non-uniformly hyperbolic diffeomorphism there are non-zero Lyapunov exponents with respect to any invariant ergodic measure with the local product structure.
