Consider a weakly nonlinear CGL equation on the torus~\mathbb{T}^d: \[u_t+i\Delta u=\epsilon [\mu(-1)^{m-1}\Delta^{m} u+b|u|^{2p}u+ ic|u|^{2q}u].\eqno{(*)}\] Here u=u(t,x), x\in\mathbb{T}^d, 0<\epsilon<<1, \mu\geqslant0, b,c\in\mathbb{R} and m,p,q\in\mathbb{N}. Define \mbox{I(u)=(I_{\dk},\dk\in\mathbb{Z}^d)}, where I_{\dk}=v_{\dk}\bar{v}_{\dk}/2 and v_{\dk}, \dk\in\mathbb{Z}^d, are the Fourier coefficients of the function~u we give. Assume that the equation (*) is well posed on time intervals of order \epsilon^{-1} and its solutions have there a-priori bounds, independent of the small parameter. Let u(t,x) solve the equation (*). If \epsilon is small enough, then for t\lesssim\epsilon^{-1}, the quantity I(u(t,x)) can be well described by solutions of an {\it effective equation}: \[u_t=\epsilon[\mu(-1)^{m-1}\Delta^m u+ F(u)],\] where the term F(u) can be constructed through a kind of resonant averaging of the nonlinearity b|u|^{2p}+ ic|u|^{2q}u.
