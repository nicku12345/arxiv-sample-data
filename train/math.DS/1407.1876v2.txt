The objective of this work is to prove, in a first step, the existence and the uniqueness of a solution of the following multivalued deterministic differential equation: dx(t)+\partial ^-\varphi (x(t))(dt)\ni dm(t),\ t>0, x(0)=x_0, where m:\mathbb{R}_+\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^d is a continuous function and \partial^-\varphi is the Fr\'{e}chet subdifferential of a semiconvex function \varphi; the domain of \varphi can be non-convex, but some regularities of the boundary are required.   The continuity of the map m\mapsto x:C([0,T];\mathbb{R}^{d})\rightarrow C([0,T] ;\mathbb{R}^{d}), which associate the input function m with the solution x of the above equation, as well as tightness criteria allow to pass from the above deterministic case to the following stochastic variational inequality driven by a multi-dimensional Brownian motion: X_t+K_t = \xi+\int_0^t F(s,X_{s})ds + \int_0^t G(s,X_s) dB_s,\; t\geq0, \; with dK_{t}(\omega)\in\partial^-\varphi( X_t (\omega))(dt).
