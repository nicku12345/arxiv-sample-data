In the present paper, the notion of Lidstone Fractal Interpolation Function (Lidstone \ FIF) is introduced to interpolate and approximate data generating functions that arise from real life objects and outcomes of several scientific experiments. A Lidstone FIF extends the classical Lidstone Interpolation Function which is generally found not to be satisfactory in interpolation and approximation of such functions. For a data \{(x_n,y_{n,2k}); n=0,1,\ldots,N \ \text{and} \ k=0,1,\ldots,p\} with N,p\in\mathbb{N}, the existence of Lidstone FIF is proved in the present work and a computational method for its construction is developed. The constructed Lidstone FIF is a C^{2p}[x_0,x_N] fractal function \ell_\alpha satisfying \ell_\alpha^{(2k)}(x_n)=y_{n,2k}, n=0,1,\ldots,N,\ k=0,1,\ldots,p. Our error estimates establish that the order of L^\infty-error in approximation of a data generating function in C^{2p}[x_0,x_N] by Lidstone FIF is of the order N^{-2p}, while L^\infty-error in approximation of 2k-order derivative of the data generating function by corresponding order derivative of Lidstone FIF is of the order N^{-(2p-2k)}. The results found in the present work are illustrated for computational constructions of a Lidstone FIF and its derivatives with an example of a data generating function.
