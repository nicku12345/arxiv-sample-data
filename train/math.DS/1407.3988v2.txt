A D_{\infty}-topological Markov chain can be represented by a pair of zero-one square matrices, which is called a flip pair. We introduce the concepts of D_{\infty}-strong shift equivalence and D_{\infty}-shift equivalence, which are equivalence relations between flip pairs. We investigate the relationships between the existence of a D_{\infty}-conjugacy, the existence of a D_{\infty}-strong shift equivalence, the existence of a D_{\infty}-shift equivalence and the coincidence of the Lind zeta functions.
