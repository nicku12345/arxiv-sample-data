This paper is about the integrability of complex vector fields in dimension three in a neighborhood of a singular point. More precisely, we study the existence of holomorphic first integrals for isolated singularities of holomorphic vector fields in complex dimension three, pursuing the discussion started in \cite{CaSc2009}. Under generic conditions, we prove a topological criteria for the existence of a holomorphic first integral. Our result may be seen as a kind of Reeb stability result for the framework of vector fields singularities in complex dimension three. As a consequence, we prove that, for the class of singularities we consider, the existence of a holomorphic first integral is invariant under topological equivalence.
