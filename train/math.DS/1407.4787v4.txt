Two examples concerning an application of topology in the study of the dynamics of an inverted plain mathematical pendulum with a pivot point moving along a horizontal straight line are considered. The first example is an application of the Wa{\.z}ewski principle to the problem of the existence of a solution without falling in the case of a arbitrary prescribed law of motion of the pivot point. The second example is a proof of the existence of periodic solution in the same system when the law of motion is periodic as well. Moreover, in the second case it is also shown that along the obtained periodic solution the pendulum never becomes horizontal (falls). The proof is an example of application of the recent developments in the fixed point theory based on the Lefschetz-Hopf theory.
