We present some inequalities that provide different sufficient conditions for an univariate monic polynomial to be Hurwitz unstable. These are motivated by difficult control problems where direct application of the Li\'enard-Chipart criterion is not feasible. Hurwitz stability of some polynomials of degree five is also discussed. These results may be interpreted as stability results for some interval polynomials.
