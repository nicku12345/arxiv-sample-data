The aim of this work is to study a kind of refinement of the entropy conjecture, in the context of partially hyperbolic diffeomorphisms with one dimensional central direction, of d-dimensional torus. We start by establishing a connection between the unstable index of hyperbolic sets and the index at algebraic level. Two examples are given which might shed light on which are the good questions in the higher dimensional center case.
