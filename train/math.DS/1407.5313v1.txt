We generalise Milnor-Thurston's kneading theory to the setting of piecewise continuous and monotone interval maps with weights. We define a weighted kneading determinant {\cal D}(t) and establish combinatorially two kneading identities, one with the cutting invariant and one with the dynamical zeta function. For the pressure \log \rho_1 of the weighted system, playing the role of entropy, we prove that {\cal D}(t) is non-zero when |t|<1/\rho_1 and has a zero at 1/\rho_1. Furthermore, our map is semi-conjugate to an analytic family h_t, 0 < t < 1/\rho_1 of Cantor PL maps converging to an interval PL map h_{1/\rho_1} with equal pressure
