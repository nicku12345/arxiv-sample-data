The aim of this work is to provide asymptotic estimates for the splitting of separatrices in a perturbed 3-degree-of-freedom Hamiltonian system, associated to a 2-dimensional whiskered torus (invariant hyperbolic torus) whose frequency ratio is a quadratic irrational number. We show that the dependence of the asymptotic estimates on the perturbation parameter is described by some functions which satisfy a periodicity property, and whose behavior depends strongly on the arithmetic properties of the frequencies.
