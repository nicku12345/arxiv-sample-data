In this paper, we study the number of limit cycles which bifurcate from the periodic orbits of cubic polynomial vector fields of Lotka-Volterra type having a rational first integral of degree 2, under polynomial perturbations of degree n. The analysis is carried out by estimating the number of zeros of the corresponding Abelian integrals. Moreover, using \emph{Chebyshev criterion}, we show that the sharp upper bound for the number of zeros of the Abelian integrals defined on each period annulus is 3 for n=3. The simultaneous bifurcation and distribution of limit cycles for the system with two period annuli under cubic polynomial perturbations are considered. All configurations (u,v) with 0\leq u, v\leq 3, u+v\leq5 are realizable.
