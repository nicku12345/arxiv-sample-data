We analyze canard explosions in delayed differential equations with a one-dimensional slow manifold. This study is applied to explore the dynamics of the van der Pol slow-fast system with delayed self-coupling. In the absence of delays, this system provides a canonical example of a canard explosion. We show that as the delay is increased a family of `classical' canard explosions ends as a Bogdanov-Takens bifurcation occurs at the folds points of the S-shaped critical manifold.
