We establish a strong form of local rigidity for hyperbolic automorphisms of the 3-torus with real spectrum. Namely, let L\colon\mathbb T^3\to\mathbb T^3 be a hyperbolic automorphism of the 3-torus with real spectrum and let f be a C^1 small perturbation of L. Then f is smoothly (C^\infty) conjugate to L if and only if obstructions to C^1 conjugacy given by the eigenvalues at periodic points of f vanish. By combining our result and a local rigidity result of Kalinin and Sadovskaya for conformal automorphisms this completes the local rigidity program for hyperbolic automorphisms in dimension 3. Our work extends de la Llave-Marco-Moriy\'on 2-dimensional local rigidity theory.
