In this paper we mainly study the global structure of the quaternion Bernoulli equations \dot q=aq+bq^n for q\in \mathbb H the quaternion field and also some other form of cubic quaternion differential equations. By using the Liouvillian theorem of integrability and the topological characterization of 2--dimensional torus: orientable compact connected surface of genus one, we prove that the quaternion Bernoulli equations may have invariant tori, which possesses a full Lebesgue measure subset of \mathbb H. Moreover, if n=2 all the invariant tori are full of periodic orbits; if n=3 there are nfiinitely many invariant tori fulfilling periodic orbits and also infinitely many invariant ones fulfilling dense orbits.
