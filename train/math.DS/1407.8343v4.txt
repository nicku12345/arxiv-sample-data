This paper considers the general question of when a topological action of a countable group can be factored into a direct product of a nontrivial actions. In the early 1980's D. Lind considered such questions for \mathbb{Z}-shifts of finite type. We study in particular direct factorizations of subshifts of finite type over \mathbb{Z}^d and other groups, and \mathbb{Z}-subshifts which are not of finite type. The main results concern direct factors of the multidimensional full n-shift, the multidimensional 3-colored chessboard and the Dyck shift over a prime alphabet.   A direct factorization of an expansive \mathbb{G}-action must be finite, but a example is provided of a non-expansive \mathbb{Z}-action for which there is no finite direct prime factorization. The question about existence of direct prime factorization of expansive actions remains open, even for \mathbb{G}=\mathbb{Z}.
