Let f be an orientation and area preserving diffeomorphism of an oriented surface M with an isolated degenerate fixed point z_0 with Lefschetz index one. Le Roux conjectured that z_0 is accumulated by periodic orbits. In this article, we will approach Le Roux's conjecture by proving that if f is isotopic to the identity by an isotopy fixing z_0 and if the area of M is finite, then z_0 is accumulated not only by periodic points, but also by periodic orbits in the measure sense. More precisely, the Dirac measure at z_0 is the limit in weak-star topology of a sequence of invariant probability measures supported on periodic orbits. Our proof is purely topological and will works for homeomorphisms and is related to the notion of local rotation set.
