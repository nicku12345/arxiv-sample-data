The paper concerns area preserving homeomorphisms of surfaces that are isotopic to the identity. The purpose of the paper is to find a maximal identity isotopy such that we can give a fine descriptions of the dynamics of its transverse foliation. We will define a kind of identity isotopies: torsion-low isotopies. In particular, when f is a diffeomorphism with finitely many fixed points such that every fixed point is not degenerate, an identity isotopy I of f is torsion-low if and only if for every point z fixed along the isotopy, the (real) rotation number \rho(I,z), which is well defined when one blows-up f at z, is contained in (-1,1). We will prove the existence of torsion-low maximal identity isotopies, and we will deduce the local dynamics of the transverse foliations of any torsion-low maximal isotopy near any isolated singularity.
