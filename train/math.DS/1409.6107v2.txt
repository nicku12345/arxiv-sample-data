Let f:M\rightarrow M be a C^1 diffeomorphism with a dominated splitting on a compact Riemanian manifold M without boundary.   We state and prove several sufficient conditions for the topological entropy of f to be positive. The conditions deal with the dynamical behaviour of the (non-necessarily invariant) Lebesgue measure. In particular, if the Lebesgue measure is \delta-recurrent then the entropy of f is positive. We give counterexamples showing that these sufficient conditions are not necessary. Finally, in the case of partially hyperbolic diffeomorphisms, we give a positive lower bound for the entropy relating it with the dimension of the unstable and stable sub-bundles.
