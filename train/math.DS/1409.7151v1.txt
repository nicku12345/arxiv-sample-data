A criterion of joint ergodicity of several sequences of transformations of a probability measure space X of the form T_{i}^{\phi_{i}(n)} is given for the case where T_{i} are commuting measure preserving transformations of X and \phi_{i} are integer valued generalized linear functions, that is, the functions formed from conventional linear functions by an iterated use of addition, multiplication by constants, and the greatest integer function. We also establish a similar criterion for joint ergodicity of families of transformations depending of a continuous parameter, as well as a condition of joint ergodicity of sequences T_{i}^{\phi_{i}(n)} along primes.
