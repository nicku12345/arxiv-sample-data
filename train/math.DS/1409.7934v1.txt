We prove trivialization of the first cohomology with coefficients in smooth vector fields, for a class of \mathbb Z^2 parabolic actions on (SL(2, \mathbb R)\times SL(2, \mathbb R))/\Gamma, where the lattice \Gamma is irreducible and co-compact. We also obtain a splitting construction involving first and second coboundary operators in the cohomology with coefficients in smooth vector fields.
