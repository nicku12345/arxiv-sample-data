The current paper is concerned with the existence of spreading speeds and linear determinacy for two species competition systems with nonlocal dispersal in time and space periodic habitats. The notion of spreading speed intervals for such a system is first introduced via the natural features of spreading speeds. The existence and lower bounds of spreading speed intervals are then established. When the periodic dependence of the habitat is only on the time variable, the existence of a single spreading speed is proved. It also shows that, under certain conditions, the spreading speed interval in any direction is a singleton, and, moreover, the linear determinacy holds.
