The boundaries of the hyperbolic components of odd period of the multicorns contain real-analytic arcs consisting of quasi-conformally conjugate parabolic parameters. One of the main results of this paper asserts that the Hausdorff dimension of the Julia sets is a real-analytic function of the parameter along these parabolic arcs. This is achieved by constructing a complex one-dimensional quasiconformal deformation space of the parabolic arcs which are contained in the dynamically defined algebraic curves \mathrm{Per}_n(1) of a suitably complexified family of polynomials. As another application of this deformation step, we show that the dynamically natural parametrization of the parabolic arcs has a non-vanishing derivative at all but (possibly) finitely many points.   We also look at the algebraic sets \mathrm{Per}_n(1) in various families of polynomials, the nature of their singularities, and the `dynamical' behavior of these singular parameters.
