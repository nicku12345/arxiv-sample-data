We consider a family \{ T_{r} \colon [0, 1] \circlearrowleft \}_{r \in [0, 1]} of Markov interval maps interpolating between the Tent map T_{0} and the Farey map T_{1}. Letting \mathcal{P}_{r} denote the Perron-Frobenius operator of T_{r}, we show, for \beta \in [0, 1] and \alpha \in (0, 1), that the asymptotic behaviour of the iterates of \mathcal{P}_{r} applied to observables with a singularity at \beta of order \alpha is dependent on the structure of the \omega-limit set of \beta with respect to T_{r}. Having a singularity it seems that such observables do not fall into any of the function classes on which convergence to equilibrium has been previously shown.
