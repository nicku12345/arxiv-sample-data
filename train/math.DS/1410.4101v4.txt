Let \beta_1,\beta_2>1 and T_i(x,y) = \bigl(\frac{x+i}{\beta_1}, \frac{y+i}{\beta_2}\bigr),\ i\in\{\pm1\}. Let A := A_{\beta_1, \beta_2} be the unique compact set satisfying A = T_{1}(A) \cup T_{-1}(A). In this paper we give a detailed analysis of A, and the parameters (\beta_1, \beta_2) whereA satisfies various topological properties. In particular, we show that if \beta_1<\beta_2<1.202,then A has a non-empty interior, thus significantly improving the bound from [1]. In the opposite direction,we prove that the connectedness locus for this family studied in [16] is not simply connected.We prove that the set of points of A which have a unique address has positive Hausdorff dimension for all (\beta_1,\beta_2).Finally, we investigate simultaneous (\beta_1,\beta_2)-expansions of reals, which were the initial motivation for studying this family in [5].
