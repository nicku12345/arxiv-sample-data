Bowen introduced a definition of topological entropy of subset inspired by Hausdorff dimension in 1973 \cite{B}. In this paper we consider the Bowen's entropy for amenable group action dynamical systems and show that under the tempered condition, the Bowen entropy of the whole compact space for a given F{\o}lner sequence equals to the topological entropy. For the proof of this result, we establish a variational principle related to the Bowen entropy and the Brin-Katok's local entropy formula for dynamical systems with amenable group actions.
