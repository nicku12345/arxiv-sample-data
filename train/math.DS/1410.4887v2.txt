Huang, Shao and Ye recently studied pointwise multiple averages by using suitable topological models. Using a notion of dynamical cubes introduced by the authors, the Huang-Shao-Ye technique and the Host machinery of magic systems, we prove that for a system (X,\mu,S,T) with commuting transformations S and T, the average \[\frac{1}{N^2} \sum_{i,j=0}^{N-1} f_0(S^i x)f_1(T^j x)f_2(S^i T^j x)\] converges a.e. as N goes to infinity for any f_1,f_2,f_3\in L^{\infty}(\mu).
