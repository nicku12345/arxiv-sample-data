Let K be the Cantor set. We prove that arbitrarily close to a homeomorphism T:K\rightarrow K there exists a homeomorphism \widetilde T:K\rightarrow K such that the \alpha-limit and the \omega-limit of every orbit is a periodic orbit. We also prove that arbitrarily close to an endomorphism T:K\rightarrow K there exists an endomorphism \widetilde T:K\rightarrow K close to T such that every orbit is finally periodic.
