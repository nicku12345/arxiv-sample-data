Bifurcations of the A_{n} type in Arnold's classification, in non-autonomous p-periodic difference equations generated by parameter depending families with p maps, are studied. It is proved that the conditions of degeneracy, non-degeneracy and unfolding are invariant relative to cyclic order of compositions for any natural number n. The main tool for the proofs is local topological conjugacy. Invariance results are essential to the proper definition of the bifurcations A_{n}, and lower codimension bifurcations associated, using all the possible cyclic compositions of the fiber families of maps of the p-periodic difference equation. Finally, we present two actual examples of A_{3} or swallowtail bifurcation occurring in period two difference equations for which the bifurcation conditions are invariant.
