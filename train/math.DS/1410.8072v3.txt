We investigate the integrability of 2-dimensional invariant distributions (tangent sub-bundles) which arise naturally in the context of dynamical systems on 3-manifolds. In particular we prove unique integrability of dynamically dominated and volume dominated Lipschitz continuous invariant decompositions as well as distributions with some other regularity conditions.
