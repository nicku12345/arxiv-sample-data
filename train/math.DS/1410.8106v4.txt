In this paper, we generalize and develop results of Queffelec allowing us to characterize the spectrum of an aperiodic substitution in \mathbb{Z}^d by describing the Fourier coefficients of mutually singular measures of pure type giving rise to the maximal spectral type of its Koopman representation. We note that this is done without the assumptions of primitivity or trivial height, and provides a simple algorithm for determining singularity to Lebesgue spectrum for such substitutions. This is used to show that the spectrum of any aperiodic bijective and commutative \mathbb{Z}^d substitution on a finite alphabet is purely singular. Additionally, we use the algorithm to show singularity of the spectrum for Queffelec's noncommutative bijective substitution, as well as the Table tiling, answering an open question of Solomyak.
