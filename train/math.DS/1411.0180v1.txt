For a finite alphabet \mathcal{A} and shift X\subseteq\mathcal{A}^{\mathbb{Z}} whose factor complexity function grows at most linearly, we study the algebraic properties of the automorphism group {\rm Aut}(X). For such systems, we show that every finitely generated subgroup of {\rm Aut}(X) is virtually {\mathbb Z}^d, in contrast to the behavior when the complexity function grows more quickly. With additional dynamical assumptions we show more: if X is transitive, then {\rm Aut}(X) is virtually \mathbb Z; if X has dense aperiodic points, then {\rm Aut}(X) is virtually {\mathbb Z}^d. We also classify all finite groups that arise as the automorphism group of a shift.
