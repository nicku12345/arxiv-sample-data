The stability of the solution to the equation \dot{u} = A(t)u + G(t,u)+f(t), t\ge 0, u(0)=u_0 is studied. Here A(t) is a linear operator in a Hilbert space H and G(t,u) is a nonlinear operator in H for any fixed t\ge 0. We assume that \|G(t,u)\|\le \alpha(t)\|u\|^p, p>1, and the spectrum of A(t) lies in the half-plane \Real \lambda \le \gamma(t) where \gamma(t) can take positive and negative values. We proved that the equilibrium solution u=0 to the equation is Lyapunov stable under persistantly acting perturbations f(t) if \sup_{t\ge 0}\int_0^t \gamma(\xi)\, d\xi <\infty and \int_0^\infty \alpha(\xi)\, d\xi<\infty. In addition, if \int_0^t \gamma(\xi)\, d\xi \to -\infty as t\to\infty, then we proved that the equilibrium solution u=0 is asymptotically stable under persistantly acting perturbations f(t). Sufficient conditions for the solution u(t) to be bounded and for \lim_{t\to\infty}u(t) = 0 are proposed and justified.
