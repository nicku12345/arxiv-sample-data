In this article, we give the exact interval of the cross section of the so called Mandelbric set generated by the polynomial z^3+c where z and c are complex numbers. Following that result, we show that the Mandelbric defined on the hyperbolic numbers \mathbb{D} is a square with its center at the origin. Moreover, we define the Multibrot sets generated by a polynomial of the form Q_{p,c}(\eta )=\eta^p+c (p \in \mathbb{N} and p \geq 2) for tricomplex numbers. More precisely, we prove that the tricomplex Mandelbric has four principal slices instead of eight principal 3D slices that arise for the case of the tricomplex Mandelbrot set. Finally, we prove that one of these four slices is an octahedron.
