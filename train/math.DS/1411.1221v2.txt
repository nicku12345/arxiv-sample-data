We build an example of a non-transitive, dynamically coherent partially hyperbolic diffeomorphism f on a closed 3-manifold with exponential growth in its fundamental group such that f^n is not isotopic to the identity for all n\neq 0. This example contradicts a conjecture in \cite{HHU}. The main idea is to consider a well-understood time-t map of a non-transitive Anosov flow and then carefully compose with a Dehn twist.
