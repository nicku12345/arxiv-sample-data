This paper considers discrete-time switched systems under dwell-time switching and in the presence of saturation nonlinearity. Based on Multiple Lyapunov Functions and using polytopic representation of nested saturation functions, a sufficient condition for asymptotic stability of such systems is derived. It is shown that this condition is equivalent to linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) and as a result, the estimation of domain of attraction is formulated into a convex optimization problem with LMI constraints. Through numerical examples, it is shown that the proposed approach is less conservative than the others in terms of both minimal dwell-time needed for stability and the size of the obtained domain of attraction.
