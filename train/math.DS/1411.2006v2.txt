The classification of all real and rational Anosov Lie algebras up to dimension 8 is given by Lauret and Will. In this paper we study 9-dimensional Anosov Lie algebras by using the properties of very special algebraic numbers and Lie algebra classification tools. We prove that there exists a unique (up to a Lie algebra isomorphism) complex 3-step Anosov Lie algebra of dimension 9. In the 2-step case, we prove that a 2-step real 9-dimensional Anosov Lie algebra with no abelian factor must have a 3-dimensional derived algebra and we characterize these Lie algebras in terms of their Pfaffian forms. Among these Lie algebras, we have found a family of infinitely many complex nonisomorphic Anosov Lie algebras.
