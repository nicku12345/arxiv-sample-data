We study the closure of the cubic Principal Hyperbolic Domain and its intersection \mathcal{P}_\lambda with the slice \mathcal{F}_\lambda of the space of all cubic polynomials with fixed point 0 defined by the multiplier \lambda at 0. We show that any bounded domain \mathcal{W} of \mathcal{F}_\lambda\setminus\mathcal{P}_\lambda consists of J-stable polynomials f with connected Julia sets J(f) and is either of \emph{Siegel capture} type (then f\in \mathcal{W} has an invariant Siegel domain U around 0 and another Fatou domain V such that f|_V is two-to-one and f^k(V)=U for some k>0) or of \emph{queer} type (then at least one critical point of f\in \mathcal{W} belongs to J(f), the set J(f) has positive Lebesgue measure, and carries an invariant line field).
