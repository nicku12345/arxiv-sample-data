In this paper we will show that if a sequence of natural numbers satisfies a certain growth rate, then there is a weak mixing diffeomorphism on \mathbb{T}^2 that is uniformly rigid with respect to that sequence. The proof is based on a quantitative version of the Anosov-Katok-method with explicitly defined conjugation maps and the constructions are done in the C^{\infty}-topology as well as in the real-analytic topology.
