We extend the results and techniques from \cite{FJJK} to study the combinatorial dynamics (\emph{forcing}) and entropy of quasiperiodically forced skew-products on the cylinder. For these maps we prove that a cyclic permutation \tau forces a cyclic permutation \nu as interval patterns if and only if \tau forces \nu as cylinder patterns. This result gives as a corollary the Sharkovski\u{\i} Theorem for quasiperiodically forced skew-products on the cylinder proved in \cite{FJJK}.   Next, the notion of s-horseshoe is defined for quasiperiodically forced skew-products on the cylinder and it is proved, as in the interval case, that if a quasiperiodically forced skew-product on the cylinder has an s-horseshoe then its topological entropy is larger than or equals to \log(s).   Finally, if a quasiperiodically forced skew-product on the cylinder has a periodic orbit with pattern \tau, then h(F) \ge h(f_{\tau}), where f_{\tau} denotes the \emph{connect-the-dots} interval map over a periodic orbit with pattern \tau. This implies that if the period of \tau is 2^n q with n \ge 0 and q \ge 1 odd, then h(F) \ge \tfrac{\log(\lambda_q)}{2^n}, where \lambda_1 = 1 and, for each q \ge 3, \lambda_q is the largest root of the polynomial x^{q} - 2x^{q-2} - 1. Moreover, for every m=2^n q with n \ge 0 and q \ge 1 odd, there exists a quasiperiodically forced skew-product on the cylinder F_m with a periodic orbit of period m such that h(F_m) = \tfrac{\log(\lambda_q)}{2^n}. This extends the analogous result for interval maps to quasiperiodically forced skew-products on the cylinder.
