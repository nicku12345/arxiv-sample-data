We show that the geometric limit as n \rightarrow \infty of the filled Julia sets K(P_{n,c}) for the maps P_{n,c}(z) = z^n + c does not exist for almost every c on the unit circle. Furthermore, we show that there is always a subsequence along which the limit does exist and equals the unit circle, and this is used to show that for certain parameters, the geometric limit of the Julia sets J(P_{n,c}) is the unit circle.
