We compute an explicit representation of the (topological) automorphism group or a particular Toeplitz subshift. The automorphism group is a (non-finitely generated) subgroup of rational numbers under addition and the shift map corresponds to the rational number 1. The group is the additive subgroup of the rational numbers generated by the powers of 5/2.
