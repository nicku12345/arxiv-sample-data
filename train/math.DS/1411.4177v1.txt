We are going to study the dynamical properties of the rational semigroup Q_{t}(\mu) where Q_{t}(\mu)= (1-t) \mu * (1- t \mu)^{-1}, for t \in [0,1), that is defined for \mu \in \mathcal{P}(G), the set of Borel probabilities over (G, \cdot) an abelian compact topological group where we define the \textbf{convolution}, \nu * \mu \in \mathcal{P}(G), as usual for a group \int f d(\nu * \mu)= \int \int f(xy) d\nu(x) d\mu(y), then (\mathcal{P}(G), *) became a \textbf{convolution measure algebra} (CM-algebra). We investigate several properties for this semigroup (as the Stable Manifold Theorem, Asymptotic behavior, invariant sets, differential properties, stationary points, etc) and how they are related with the Choquet-Deny equation. As an application we give a complete description of this semigroup for finite abelian groups.
