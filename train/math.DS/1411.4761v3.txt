We investigate a renewal scheme for non-uniformly hyperbolic semiflows that closely resembles the renewal scheme developed in the discrete time case, in order to obtain sharp estimates for the correlation function. Also, the involved observables are supported on a flow-box of unbounded length. The present abstract setting does not require the use of Markov structure. However, the classes of examples covered here are rather restrictive. In these examples, it is easier to exploit the full force of the method and get optimal results for observables supported on finite length flow-boxes.
