Dynamical systems generated by d\ge2 commuting homeomorphisms (topological \mathbb{Z}^d-actions) contain within them structures on many scales, and in particular contain many actions of \mathbb{Z}^k for 1\le k\le d. Familiar dynamical invariants for homeomorphisms, like entropy and periodic point data, become more complex and permit multiple definitions. We briefly survey some of these and other related invariants in the setting of algebraic \mathbb{Z}^d-actions, showing how, even in settings where the natural entropy as a \mathbb{Z}^d-action vanishes, a powerful theory of directional entropy and periodic points can be built. An underlying theme is uniformity in dynamical invariants as the direction changes, and the connection between this theory and problems in number theory; we explore this for several invariants. We also highlight Fried's notion of average entropy and its connection to uniformities in growth properties, and prove a new relationship between this entropy and periodic point growth in this setting.
