We introduce multifractal pressure and dynamical multifractal zeta-functions providing precise information of a very general class of multifractal spectra, including, for example, the fine multifractal spectra of graph-directed self-conformal measures and the fine multifractal spectra of ergodic Birkhoff averages of continuous functions on graph-directed self-conformal sets.
