We show, for every r>d\ge 0 or r=d\ge 2, the existence of a Baire generic set of C^d-families of C^r-maps (f_a)_{a\in (-1,1)^k} of a manifold M of dimension \ge 2, so that for every a small the map f_a has infinitely many sinks. When the dimension of the manifold is greater than 3, the generic set is formed by families of diffeomorphisms. This result is a counter-example to a conjecture of Pugh and Shub.
