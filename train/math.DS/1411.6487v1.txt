We consider ergodic series of the form \sum_{n=0}^\infty a_n f(T^n x) where f is an integrable function with zero mean value with respect to a T-invariant measure \mu. Under certain conditions on the dynamical system T, the invariant measure \mu and the function f, we prove that the series converges \mu-almost everywhere if and only if \sum_{n=0}^\infty |a_n|^2<\infty, and that in this case the sum of the convergent series is exponentially integrable and satisfies a Khintchine type inequality. We also prove that the system \{f\circ T^n\} is a Riesz system if and only if the spectral measure of f is absolutely continuous with respect to the Lebesgue measure and the Radon-Nikodym derivative is bounded from above as well as from below by a constant. We check the conditions for Gibbs measures \mu relative to hyperbolic dynamics T and for H\"{o}lder functions f. An application is given to the study of differentiability of the Weierstrass type functions \sum_{n=0}^\infty a_n f(3^n x).
