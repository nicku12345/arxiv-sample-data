In this work we obtain the general form of polynomial mappings that commute with a linear action of a relative symmetry group. The aim is to give results for relative equivariant polynomials that correspond to the results for relative invariants obtained in a previous paper [P.H. Baptistelli, M. Manoel (2013) Invariants and relative invariants under compact Lie groups, J. Pure Appl. Algebra 217, 2213{2220]. We present an algorithm to compute generators for relative equivariant submodules from the invariant theory applied to the subgroup formed only by the symmetries. The same method provides, as a particular case, generators for equivariants under the whole group from the knowledge of equivariant generators by a smaller subgroup, which is normal of finite index.
