We present here a construction of horseshoes for any \mathcal{C}^{1+\alpha} mapping f preserving an ergodic hyperbolic measure \mu with h_{\mu}(f)>0 and then deduce that the exponential growth rate of the number of periodic points for any \mathcal{C}^{1+\alpha} mapping f is greater than or equal to h_{\mu}(f). We also prove that the exponential growth rate of the number of hyperbolic periodic points is equal to the hyperbolic entropy. The hyperbolic entropy means the entropy resulting from hyperbolic measures.
