The key result of this article is key lemma: if a Jordan curve \gamma is invariant by a given C 1+\alpha -diffeomorphism f of a surface and if \gamma carries an ergodic hyperbolic probability \mu, then \mu is supported on a periodic orbit. From this Lemma we deduce three new results for the C 1+\alpha symplectic twist maps f of the annulus: 1. if \gamma is a loop at the boundary of an instability zone such that f |\gamma has an irrational rotation number, then the convergence of any orbit to \gamma is slower than exponential; 2. if \mu is an invariant probability that is supported in an invariant curve \gamma with an irrational rotation number, then \gamma is C 1 \mu-almost everywhere; 3. we prove a part of the so-called "Greene criterion", introduced by J. M. Greene in [16] in 1978 and never proved: assume that (pn qn) is a sequence of rational numbers converging to an irrational number \omega; let (f k (x n)) 1\lek\leqn be a minimizing periodic orbit with rotation number pn qn and let us denote by R n its mean residue R n = |1/2 -- Tr(Df qn (x n))/4|
