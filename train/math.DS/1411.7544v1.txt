We consider the substitution \sigma_{a,b} defined by \begin{array}{rlcl} \sigma_{a,b}: & 1 & \mapsto & \underbrace{1\ldots 1}_{a}2 \\ & 2 & \mapsto & \underbrace{1\ldots 1}_{b}3 \\ & 3 & \mapsto & 1 \end{array}  with a\geq b\geq 1. The shift dynamical system induced by \sigma_{a,b} is measure theoretically isomorphic to an exchange of three domains on a compact tile \mathcal{T}_{a,b} with fractal boundary.   We prove that \mathcal{T}_{a,b} is homeomorphic to the closed disk iff 2b-a\leq 3. This solves a conjecture of Shigeki Akiyama posed in 1997. To this effect, we construct a H\"older continuous parametrization C_{a,b}:\mathbb{S}^1\to\partial \mathcal{T}_{a,b} of the boundary of \mathcal{T}_{a,b}. As a by-product, this parametrization gives rise to an increasing sequence of polygonal approximations of \partial \mathcal{T}_{a,b}, whose vertices lye on \partial \mathcal{T}_{a,b} and have algebraic pre-images in the parametrization.
