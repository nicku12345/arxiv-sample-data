We provide a systematic approach for deducing statistical limit laws via martingale-coboundary decomposition, for nonuniformly hyperbolic systems with slowly contracting and expanding directions. In particular, if the associated return time function is square-integrable, then we obtain the central limit theorem, the weak invariance principle, and an iterated version of the weak invariance principle.
