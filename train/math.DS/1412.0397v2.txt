Let \Pi_g be the surface group of genus g (g\geq2), and denote by \RR_{\Pi_g} the space of the homomorphisms from \Pi_g into the group of the orientation preserving homeomorphisms of S^1. Let 2g-2=kl for some positive integers k and l. Then the subset of \RR_{\Pi_g} formed by those \varphi which are semiconjugate to k-fold lifts of some homomorphisms and which have Euler number eu(\varphi)=l is shown to be clopen. This leads to a new proof of the main result of Kathryn Mann \cite{Mann} from a completely different approach.
