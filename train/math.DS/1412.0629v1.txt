Despite the invertible setting, Anosov endomorphisms may have infinitely many unstable directions. Here we prove, under transitivity assumption, that an Anosov endomorphism on a closed manifold M, is either special (that is, every x \in M has only one unstable direction) or for a typical point in M there are infinitely many unstable directions. Other result of this work is the semi rigidity of the unstable Lyapunov exponent of a C^{1+\alpha} codimension one Anosov endomorphism and C^1 close to a linear endomorphism of \mathbb{T}^n for (n \geq 2). In the appendix we give a proof for ergodicity of C^{1+\alpha}, \alpha > 0, conservative Anosov endomorphism.
