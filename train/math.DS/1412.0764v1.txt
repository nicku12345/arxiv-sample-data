This article is devoted to level-1 large deviation properties in some nonuniformly hyperbolic systems via Pesin theory. In particular, our result can be applied to the nonuniformly hyperbolic diffeomorphisms described by Katok and several other classes of diffeomorphisms derived from Anosov systems.
