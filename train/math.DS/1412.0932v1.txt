We study main bifurcations of multidimensional diffeomorphisms having a non-transversal homoclinic orbit to a saddle-node fixed point. On a parameter plane we build a bifurcation diagram for single-round periodic orbits lying entirely in a small neighbourhood of the homoclinic orbit. Also a relation of our results to well-known codimension one bifurcations of a saddle fixed point with a quadratic homoclinic tangency and a saddle-node fixed point with a transversal homoclinic orbit is discussed.
