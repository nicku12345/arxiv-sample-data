Time-periodic perturbations of an asymmetric Duffing-Van-der-Pol equation close to an integrable equation with a homoclinic "figure-eight" of a saddle are considered. The behavior of solutions outside the neighborhood of "figure-eight" is studied analytically. The problem of limit cycles for an autonomous equation is solved and resonance zones for a nonautonomous equation are analyzed. The behavior of the separatrices of a fixed saddle point of the Poincare map in the small neighborhood of the unperturbed "figure-eight" is ascertained. The results obtained are illustrated by numerical computations.
