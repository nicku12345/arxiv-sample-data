We study chaotic dynamics in nonholonomic model of Celtic stone. We show that, for certain values of parameters characterizing geometrical and physical properties of the stone, a strange Lorenz-like attractor is observed in the model. We study also bifurcation scenarios for appearance and break-down of this attractor.
