In this paper, we study the dynamical properties of actions on the space of compact subsets of the phase space. More precisely, if X is a metric space, let 2^X denote the space of non-empty compact subsets of X provided with the Hausdorff topology. If f is a continuous self-map on X, there is a naturally induced continuous self-map f_* on 2^X. Our main theme is the interrelation between the dynamics of f and f_*. For such a study, it is useful to consider the space \mathcal{C}(K,X) of continuous maps from a Cantor set K to X provided with the topology of uniform convergence, and f_* induced on \mathcal{C}(K,X) by composition of maps. We mainly study the properties of transitive points of the induced system (2^X,f_*) both topologically and dynamically, and give some examples. We also look into some more properties of the system (2^X,f_*).
