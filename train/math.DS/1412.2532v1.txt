We consider the dynamical system given by a diagonalizable element a of a closed linear unimodular algebraic subgroup G of the special linear group over the p-adic numbers acting by translation on a finite volume quotient X. Assuming that this action is exponentially mixing (e.g.\ if G is simple) we give an effective version (in terms of K-finite vectors of the regular representation) of the following statement: If \mu is an a-invariant probability measure with measure-theoretical entropy close to the topological entropy of a then \mu is close to the unique G-invariant probability measure of X.
