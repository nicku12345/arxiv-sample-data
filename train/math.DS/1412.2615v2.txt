We consider the holomorphic normalization problem for a holomorphic vector field in the neighborhood of the product of a fixed point and an invariant torus. Supposing that the vector field is a perturbation of a linear part around the fixed point and of a rotation on the invariant torus (the unperturbed vector field is called the quasi-linear part of the perturbed one), it was shown by J.Aurouet that the system is holomorphically linearizable if there are no exact resonances in the quasi-linear part and if the quasi-linear part satisfies to Brjuno's arithmetical condition. In the presence of exact resonances, a conjecture by Brjuno states that the system will still be holomorphically conjugated to a normal form under the same arithmetical condition and a strong algebraic condition on the formal normal form. This article proves this conjecture.
