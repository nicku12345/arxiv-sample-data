Given k>0 and an Abelian countable discrete group G with elements of infinite order, we construct (i) rigid funny rank-one infinite measure preserving (i.m.p.) G-actions of ergodic index k, (ii) 0-type funny rank-one i.m.p. G-actions of ergodic index k, (iii) funny rank-one i.m.p. G-actions T of ergodic index 2 such that the product T\times T^{-1} is not ergodic. It is shown that T\times T^{-1} is conservative for each funny rank-one G-action T.
