We consider the class of diffeomorphisms of a manifold that its differential keeps invariant a one-dimensional subbundle E. For that type of diffeomorphisms is naturally defined a one-parameter family called E-translation. We prove that if a diffeomorphisms in above mentioned class is conjugate to its E-translation and the conjugacy is at distance \alpha-H\"older to the identity respect to the parameter and \alpha>1/2, then the E-direction is hyperbolic.   This theorem is also sharp as it is be discussed with some examples. We also deal with the continuously stable case in the Skew-Products context with one-dimensional fibers, requiring extra hypothesis along the fibers like either non-negative second derivative or negative Schwartzian.
