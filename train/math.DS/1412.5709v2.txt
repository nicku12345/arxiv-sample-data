In this paper we lay the foundations of a not necessarily rational negative imaginary systems theory and its relations with positive real systems theory and, hence, with passivity. In analogy with the theory of positive real functions, in our general framework, negative imaginary systems are defined in terms of a domain of analyticity of the transfer function and of a sign condition that must be satisfied in such domain. In this way, on the one hand, our theory does not require to restrict the attention to systems with rational transfer function and, on the other hand | just by suitably selecting the domain of analyticity to be either the right half complex plane or the complement of the unit disc in the complex plane | we particularize our theory to both continuous-time and to discrete-time systems. Indeed, to the best of our knowledge, this is first time that discrete-time negative imaginary systems are studied in the literature. In this work, we also aim to provide a unitary view of the different notions that have appeared so far in the literature within the framework of positive real and in the more recent theory of negative imaginary systems, and to show how these notions are characterized and linked to each other.   A stability analysis result for the interconnection of discrete-time systems is also derived.
