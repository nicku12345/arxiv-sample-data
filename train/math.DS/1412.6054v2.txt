We study the geometric and topological properties of strange non-chaotic attractors created in non-smooth saddle-node bifurcations of quasiperiodically forced interval maps. By interpreting the attractors as limit objects of the iterates of a continuous curve and controlling the geometry of the latter, we determine their Hausdorff and box-counting dimension and show that these take distinct values. Moreover, the same approach allows to describe the topological structure of the attractors and to prove their minimality.
