The commonly used spatial entropy h_{r}(\mathcal{U}) of the multi-dimensional shift space \mathcal{U} is the limit of growth rate of admissible local patterns on finite rectangular sublattices which expands to whole space \mathbb{Z}^{d}, d\geq 2. This work studies spatial entropy h_{\Omega}(\mathcal{U}) of shift space \mathcal{U} on general expanding system \Omega=\{\Omega(n)\}_{n=1}^{\infty} where \Omega(n) is increasing finite sublattices and expands to \mathbb{Z}^{d}. \Omega is called genuinely d-dimensional if \Omega(n) contains no lower-dimensional part whose size is comparable to that of its d-dimensional part. We show that h_{r}(\mathcal{U}) is the supremum of h_{\Omega}(\mathcal{U}) for all genuinely two-dimensional \Omega. Furthermore, when \Omega is genuinely d-dimensional and satisfies certain conditions, then h_{\Omega}(\mathcal{U})=h_{r}(\mathcal{U}). On the contrary, when \Omega(n) contains a lower-dimensional part, then h_{r}(\mathcal{U})<h_{\Omega}(\mathcal{U}) for some \mathcal{U}. Therefore, h_{r}(\mathcal{U}) is appropriate to be the d-dimensional spatial entropy.
