Consider a sufficiently smooth nearly integrable Hamiltonian system of two and a half degrees of freedom in action-angle coordinates \[   H_\epsilon (\varphi,I,t)=H_0(I)+\epsilon H_1(\varphi,I,t), \varphi\in T^2,\ I\in U\subset R^2,\ t\in T=R/Z. \] Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser Theorem asserts that a set of nearly full measure in phase space consists of three dimensional invariant tori carrying quasiperiodic dynamics.   In this paper we prove that for a class of nearly integrable Hamiltonian systems there is an orbit which contains these KAM tori in its \omega-limit set. This implies that the closure of the orbit has almost full measure in the phase space. As byproduct, we show that KAM tori are Lyapunov unstable. The proof relies in the recent developments in the study of Arnold diffusion in nearly integrable systems Bernard-Kaloshin-Zhang, Kaloshin-Zhang12. It is a combination of geometric and variational techniques.
