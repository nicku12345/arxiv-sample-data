We prove that the divisor function d(n) counting the number of divisors of the integer n, is a good weighting function for the pointwise ergodic theorem. For any measurable dynamical system (X, {\mathcal A},\nu,\tau) and any f\in L^p(\nu), p>1, the limit  \lim_{n\to \infty}{1\over \sum_{k=1}^{n} d(k)} \sum_{k=1}^{n} d(k)f(\tau^k x) exists \nu-almost everywhere. We also obtain similar results for other arithmetical functions, like \theta(n) function counting the number of squarefree divisors of n and the generalized Euler totient function J_s(n), s>0. We use Bourgain's method, namely the circle method based on the shift model.
