We develop a thermodynamic formalism for a strongly dissipative H\'enon-like map at the first bifurcation parameter at which the uniform hyperbolicity is destroyed by the formation of tangencies inside the limit set. For any t\in\mathbb R we prove the existence of an invariant Borel probability measure which minimizes the free energy associated with a non continuous geometric potential -t\log J^u, where J^u denotes the Jacobian in the unstable direction. Under a mild condition, we show that any accumulation point of these measures as t\to+\infty minimizes the unstable Lyapunov exponent. We also show that the equilibrium measures converge as t\to-\infty to a Dirac measure which maximizes the unstable Lyapunov exponent.
