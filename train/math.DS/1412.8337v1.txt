We study renormalization of highly dissipative analytic three dimensional H\'enon maps  F(x,y,z) = (f(x) - \varepsilon(x,y,z),\ x,\ \delta(x,y,z))  where  \varepsilon(x,y,z)  is a sufficiently small perturbation of  \varepsilon_{2d}(x,y) . Under certain conditions,  C^r  single invariant surfaces each of which is tangent to the invariant plane field over the critical Cantor set exist for  2 \leq r < \infty . The  C^r  conjugation from an invariant surface to the  xy- plane defines renormalization two dimensional  C^r  H\'enon-like map. It also defines two dimensional embedded  C^r  H\'enon-like maps in three dimension. In this class, universality theorem is re-constructed by conjugation. Geometric properties on the critical Cantor set in invariant surfaces are the same as those of two dimensional maps --- non existence of the continuous line field and unbounded geometry. The set of embedded two dimensional H\'enon-like maps is open and dense subset of the parameter space of average Jacobian,  b_{F_{2d}}  for any given smoothness,  2 \leq r < \infty .
