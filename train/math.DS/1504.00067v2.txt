In this article we give necessary and sufficient conditions that a complex number must satisfy to be a continuous eigenvalue of a minimal Cantor system. Similarly, for minimal Cantor systems of finite rank, we provide necessary and sufficient conditions for having a measure theoretical eigenvalue. These conditions are established from the combinatorial information of the Bratteli-Vershik representations of such systems. As an application, from any minimal Cantor system, we construct a strong orbit equivalent system without irrational eigenvalues which shares all measure theoretical eigenvalues with the original system. In a second application a minimal Cantor system is constructed satisfying the so-called maximal continuous eigenvalue group property.
