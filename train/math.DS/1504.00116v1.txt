We use rigorous numerical techniques to compute a lower bound for the exponent of expansivity outside a neighborhood of the critical point for thousands of intervals of parameter values in the quadratic family. We compute a possibly small radius of the critical neighborhood, and a lower bound for the corresponding expansivity exponent outside this neighborhood, valid for all the parameters in each of the intervals. We illustrate and study the distribution of the radii and these exponents. The results of our computations are mathematically rigorous. The source code of the software and the results of the computations are made publicly available at http://www.pawelpilarczyk.com/quadratic/..
