We present, in dimension n \geq 3, a survey of examples to: the Jacobian conjecture, the weak Markus--Yamabe conjecture. Furthermore, we show and construct new examples of vector fields where the origin is almost globally asymptotically stable by using the novel concept of density functions introduced by Rantzer.
