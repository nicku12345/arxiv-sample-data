In this paper we study several stronger forms of sensitivity for continuous surjective selfmaps on compact metric spaces and relations between them. The main result of the paper states that a minimal system is either multi-sensitive or an almost one-to-one extension of its maximal equicontinuous factor, which is an analog of the Auslander-Yorke dichotomy theorem. For minimal dynamical systems, we also show that all notions of thick sensitivity, multi-sensitivity and thickly syndetical sensitivity are equivalent, and all of them are much stronger than sensitivity.
