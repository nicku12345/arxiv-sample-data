In this paper we develop some new KAM-technique to prove two general KAM theorems for nearly integrable hamiltonian systems without assuming any non-degeneracy condition. Many of KAM-type results (including the classical KAM theorem) are special cases of our theorems under some non-degeneracy condition and some smoothness condition.   Moreover, we can obtain some interesting results about KAM tori with prescribed frequencies.
