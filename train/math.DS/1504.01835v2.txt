Let f: M \to M be a C^{1+\theta}-partially hyperbolic diffeomorphism. We introduce a type of modified Schmidt games which is induced by f and played on any unstable manifold. Utilizing it we generalize some results of \cite{Wu} as follows. Consider a set of points with non-dense forward orbit: E(f, y) := \{ z\in M: y\notin \overline{\{f^k(z), k \in \mathbb{N}\}}\} for some y \in M and E_{x}(f, y) := E(f, y) \cap W^u(x) for any x\in M. We show that E_x(f,y) is a winning set for such modified Schmidt games played on W^u(x), which implies that E_x(f,y) has Hausdorff dimension equal to \dim W^u(x). Then for any nonempty open set V \subset M we show that E(f, y) \cap V has full Hausdorff dimension equal to \dim M, by using a technique of constructing measures supported on E(f, y) with lower pointwise dimension approximating \dim M.
