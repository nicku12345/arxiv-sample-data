Piecewise smooth maps are known to exhibit a wide range of dynamical features including numerous types of periodic orbits. Predicting regions in parameter space where such periodic orbits might occur and determining their stability is crucial to characterize the dynamics of the system. However, obtaining the conditions of existence and stability of these periodic orbits generally use brute force methods which require successive application of the iterative map on a starting point. In this article, we propose a faster and more elegant way of obtaining those conditions without iterating the complete map. The method revolves around direct computation of higher powers of matrices without computing the lower ones and is applicable on any dimension of the phase space. In the later part of the article, we compare the speed of the proposed method with the other popular algorithms which shows the effectiveness of the proposed method in higher dimensions. We also illustrate the use of this method in computing the regions of existence and stability of a particular class of periodic orbits in three dimensions.
