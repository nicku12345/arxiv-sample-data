The dynamical system on T^2 which is a group extension over an irrational rotation on T^1 is investigated. The criterion when the extension is minimal, a system of order 2 and when the maximal equicontinuous factor is the irrational rotation is given. The topological complexity of the extension is computed, and a negative answer to the latter part of an open question raised by Host-Kra-Maass is obtained.
