We give sufficient conditions for a diffeomorphism of a compact surface to be robustly N-expansive and cw-expansive in the C^r-topology. We give examples on the genus two surface showing that they need not to be Anosov diffeomorphisms. The examples are axiom A diffeomorphisms with tangencies at wandering points.
