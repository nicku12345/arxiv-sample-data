Motivated by problems coming from different areas of the applied science we study the periodic solutions of the following differential system x'(t)=F_0(t,x)+\varepsilon F_1(t,x)+\varepsilon^2 R(t,x,\varepsilon), when F_0, F_1, and R are discontinuous piecewise functions, and \varepsilon is a small parameter. It is assumed that the manifold \mathbb{Z} of all periodic solutions of the unperturbed system x'=F_0(t,x) has dimension n or smaller then n. The averaging theory is one of the best tools to attack this problem. This theory is completely developed when F_0, F_1 and R are continuous functions, and also when F_0=0 for a class of discontinuous differential systems. Nevertheless does not exist the averaging theory for studying the periodic solutions of discontinuous differential system when F_0\neq0. In this paper we develop this theory for a big class of discontinuous differential systems.
