Let f : [0, 1] \to [0, 1] be a piecewise expanding unimodal map of class C^{k+1}, with k \geq 1, and \mu = \rho dx the (unique) SRB measure associated to it. We study the regularity of \rho. In particular, points \mathcal{N} where \rho is not differentiable has zero Hausdorff dimension, but is uncountable if the critical orbit of f is dense. This improves on a work of Szewc (1984). We also obtain results about higher orders of differentiability of \rho in the sense of Whitney.
