Despite there are numerous theoretical studies of stochastic differential equations with a symmetric \alpha-stable L\'evy noise, very few regularity results exist in the case of 0<\alpha\leq1. In this paper, we study the fractional Fokker-Planck equation with Ornstein-Uhlenbeck drift, and prove that there exists a unique solution, which is C^\infty in space for t>0 when \alpha\in (0, 2].
