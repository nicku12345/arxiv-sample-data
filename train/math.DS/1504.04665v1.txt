The paper develops and studies a very general notion of dichotomy, referred to as "nonuniform (h,k,\mu,\nu)-dichotomy". The new notion contains as special cases most versions of dichotomy existing in the literature. The paper then provides corresponding new versions of robustness, Hartman-Grobman theorem, and stable manifold theorem for nonautonomous dynamical systems in Banach spaces in term of the nonuniform (h,k,\mu,\nu)-dichotomy.
