We study heteroclinic networks in \mathbb{R}^4, made of a certain type of simple robust heteroclinic cycle. In simple cycles all the connections are of saddle-sink type in two-dimensional fixed-point spaces. We show that there exist only very few ways to join such cycles together in a network and provide the list of all possible such networks in \mathbb{R}^4. The networks involving simple heteroclinic cycles of type A are new in the literature and we describe the stability of the cycles in these networks: while the geometry of type A and type B networks is very similar, stability distinguishes them clearly.
