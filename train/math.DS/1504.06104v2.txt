In 64 E. Lima proved that commuting vector fields on surfaces with non-zero Euler characteristic have common zeros. Such statement is empty in dimension 3, since all the Euler characteristics vanish. Nevertheless, \cite{Bonatti_analiticos} proposed a local version, replacing the Euler characteristic by the Poincar\'e-Hopf index of a vector field X in a region U, denoted by \operatorname{Ind}(X,U); he asked:   \emph{Given commuting vector fields X,Y and a region U where \operatorname{Ind}(X,U)\neq 0, does U contain a common zero of X and Y?}   \cite{Bonatti_analiticos} gave a positive answer in the case where X and Y are real analytic.   In this paper, we prove the existence of common zeros for commuting C^1 vector fields X, Y on a 3-manifold, in any region U such that \operatorname{Ind}(X,U)\neq 0, assuming that the set of collinearity of X and Y is contained in a smooth surface. This is a strong indication that the results in \cite{Bonatti_analiticos} should hold for C^1-vector fields.
