We prove a Krieger like embedding theorem for asymptotically expansive systems with the small boundary property. We show that such a system (X; T) embeds in the K-full shift with h_{top}(T) < \log K  and \sharp Per_n(X; T) \leq \sharp Per_n(\{1,...,K\}^{\mathbb{Z}};\sigma) for any integer n. The embedding is in general not continuous (unless the system is expansive and X is zero-dimensional) but the induced map on the set of invariant measures is a topological embedding. It is shown that this property implies asymptotical expansiveness. We prove also that the inverse of the embedding map may be continuously extended to a faithful principal symbolic extension.
