Suppose that the set {\mathcal{T}}= \{T_1, T_2,...,T_q \}  of real n\times n matrices has joint spectral radius less than 1. Then for any digit set  D= \{d_1, \cdots, d_q\} \subset {\Bbb R}^n, there exists a unique nonempty compact set F=F({\mathcal{T}},D) satisfying  F = \bigcup _{j =1}^q T_j(F + d_j), which is called a self-affine fractal. We consider an existing criterion for the convex hull of F to be a polytope, which is due to Kirat and Kocyigit. In this note, we strengthen our criterion for the case T_1=T_2=\cdots =T_q . More specifically, we give an upper bound for the number of steps needed for deciding whether the convex hull of F is a polytope or not. This improves our earlier result on the topic.
