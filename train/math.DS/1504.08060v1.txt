In this paper, let n\geq2 be an integer, P=diag(-I_{n-\kappa},I_\kappa,-I_{n-\kappa},I_\kappa) for some integer \kappa\in[0, n-1), and \Sigma \subset {\bf R}^{2n} be a partially symmetric compact convex hypersurface, i.e., x\in \Sigma implies Px\in\Sigma. We prove that if \Sigma is (r,R)-pinched with \frac{R}{r}<\sqrt{\frac{5}{3}}, then \Sigma carries at least two geometrically distinct P-symmetric closed characteristics which possess at least 2n-4\kappa Floquet multipliers on the unit circle of the complex plane.
