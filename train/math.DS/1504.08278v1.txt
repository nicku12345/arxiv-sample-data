Let (f_n)_{n=1}^\infty be a sequence of nonlinear polynomials satisfying some mild conditions. Furthermore, let F_m(z)=(f_m\circ f_{m-1}\ldots \circ f_1)(z) and \rho_m be the leading coefficient for F_m. It is shown that on the Julia set J_{(f_n)}, the Chebyshev polynomial of the degree deg{F_m} is of the form F_m(z)/\rho_m-\tau_m for all m\in\mathbb{N} where \tau_m\in\mathbb{C}. This generalizes the result obtained for autonomous Julia sets.
