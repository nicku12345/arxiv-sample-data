The Krasnosel'skii type degree formula for the equation \dot u = - Au + F(u) where A:D(A)\to E is a linear operator on a separable Banach space E such that -A is a generator of a C_0 semigroup of bounsed linear operators of E and F:E\to E is a locally Lipschitz k-set contraction, is provided. Precisely, it is shown that if V is an open bounded subset of E such that 0\not\in (-A+F)(\partial V \cap D(A)), then the topological degree of -A+F with respect to V is equal to the fixed point index of the operator of translation along trajectories for sufficiently small positive time. The obtained degree formula is crucial for the method of translation along trajctories. It is applied to the nonautonomous periodic problem and an average principle is derived. As an application a first order system of partial differential equations is considered.
