We construct a renormalization operator which acts on analytic circle maps whose critical exponent \alpha is not necessarily an odd integer 2n+1, n\in\mathbb N. When \alpha=2n+1, our definition generalizes cylinder renormalization of analytic critical circle maps. In the case when \alpha is close to an odd integer, we prove hyperbolicity of renormalization for maps of bounded type. We use it to prove universality and C^{1+\alpha}-rigidity for such maps.
