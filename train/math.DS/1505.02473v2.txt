Let f be a C^{1+\alpha} diffeomorphism of a compact Riemannian manifold and \mu an ergodic hyperbolic measure with positive entropy. We prove that for every continuous potential \phi there exists a sequence of basic sets \Omega_n such that the topological pressure P(f|\Omega_n,\phi) converges to the free energy P_{\mu}(\phi) = h(\mu) + \int\phi{d\mu}. Then we introduce a class of potentials \phi for which there exists sequence of basic sets \Omega_n such that P(f|\Omega_n,\phi) \to P(\phi).
