In this paper we focused our study on Derived From Anosov diffeomorphisms (DA diffeomorphisms ) of the torus \mathbb{T}^3, it is, an absolute partially hyperbolic diffeomorphism on \mathbb{T}^3 homotopic to an Anosov linear automorphism of the \mathbb{T}^3. We can prove that if f: \mathbb{T}^3 \rightarrow \mathbb{T}^3  is a volume preserving DA diffeomorphism homotopic to linear Anosov A, such that the center Lyapunov exponent satisfies \lambda^c_f(x) > \lambda^c_A > 0, with x  belongs to a positive volume set, then the center foliation of f is non absolutely continuous. We construct a new open class U of non Anosov and volume preserving DA diffeomorphisms, satisfying the property \lambda^c_f(x) > \lambda^c_A > 0 for m-almost everywhere x \in \mathbb{T}^3. Particularly for every f \in U, the center foliation of f is non absolutely continuous.
