In this work, we address ergodicity of smooth actions of finitely generated semi-groups on an m-dimensional closed manifold M. We provide sufficient conditions for such an action to be ergodic with respect to the Lebesgue measure. Our results improve the main result in [8], where the ergodicity for one dimensional fiber was proved. We will introduce Markov partition for finitely generated semi-group actions and then we establish ergodicity for a large class of finitely generated semi-groups of C^{1+alpha}-diffeomorphisms that admit a Markov partition. Moreover, we present some transitivity criteria for semi-group actions and provide a weaker form of dynamical irreducibility that suffices to ergodicity in our setting.
