Rigorous nonlinear analysis of the physical model of Costas loop --- a classic phase-locked loop (PLL) based circuit for carrier recovery, is a challenging task. Thus for its analysis, simplified mathematical models and numerical simulation are widely used. In this work a short survey on nonlinear models of the BPSK Costas loop, used for pre-design and post-design analysis, is presented. Their rigorous derivation and limitations of classic analysis are discussed. It is shown that the use of simplified mathematical models, and the application of non rigorous methods of analysis (e.g., simulation and linearization) may lead to wrong conclusions concerning the performance of the Costas loop physical model.
