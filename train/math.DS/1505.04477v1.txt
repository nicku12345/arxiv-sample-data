It follows from Oseledec Multiplicative Ergodic Theorem that the Lyapunov-irregular set of points for which the Oseledec averages of a given continuous cocycle diverge has zero measure with respect to any invariant probability measure. In strong contrast, for any dynamical system f:X\rightarrow X with exponential specification property and a H\ddot{\text{o}}lder continuous matrix cocycle A:X\rightarrow G (m,\mathbb{R}), we show here that if there exist ergodic measures with different Lyapunov spectrum, then the Lyapunov-irregular set of A is residual (i.e., containing a dense G_\delta set).
