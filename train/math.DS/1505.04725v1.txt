Let F_2 denote the free group on two generators a,b. For any measure-preserving system (X, {\mathcal X}, \mu, (T_g)_{g \in F_2}) on a finite measure space X = (X,{\mathcal X},\mu), any f \in L^1(X), and any n \geq 1, define the averaging operators {\mathcal A}_n f(x) := \frac{1}{4 \times 3^{n-1}} \sum_{g \in F_2: |g| = n} f( T_g^{-1} x ), where |g| denotes the word length of g. We give an example of a measure-preserving system X and an f \in L^1(X) such that the sequence {\mathcal A}_n f(x) is unbounded in n for almost every x, thus showing that the pointwise and maximal ergodic theorems do not hold in L^1 for actions of F_2. This is despite the results of Nevo-Stein and Bufetov, who establish pointwise and maximal ergodic theorems in L^p for p>1 and for L \log L respectively, as well as an estimate of Naor and the author establishing a weak-type (1,1) maximal inequality for the action on \ell^1(F_2). Our construction is a variant of a counterexample of Ornstein concerning iterates of a Markov operator.
