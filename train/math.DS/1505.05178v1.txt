We consider the Lagrange and the Markov dynamical spectra associated to a geodesic flow on a surface of negative curvature. We show that for a large set of real functions on the unit tangent bundle and for typical metrics with negative curvature and finite volume, both the Lagrange and the Markov dynamical spectra have non-empty interior.
