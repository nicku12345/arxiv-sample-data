In this paper we consider fractal percolation random Cantor sets E on the plane constructed with non-homogeneous probabilities. We focus on the case when the probabilities are large enough to guarantee that the almost sure dimension of E is greater than 1.   Under this assumption in the case of homogeneous (equal) probabilities it was proved by Rams and the first author that the orthogonal projection of E contains an interval simultaneously in all directions. Moreover, Peres and Rams proved the stronger result that the orthogonal projection of the natural measure on E to every line is absolutely continuous with H\"older-continuous density.   We point out that in the case of non-homogeneous probabilities neither of the two previous assertions remain valid. However, we also prove that in the non-homogeneous case every line whose tangent is neither a rational nor a Liouville number is non-exceptional. That is, almost surely for all of these directions the projection of E contains some interval and the projection of the natural measure has H\"older-continuous density.
