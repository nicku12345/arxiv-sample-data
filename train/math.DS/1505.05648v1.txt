We give a short proof of the unique ergodicity of the strong stable foliation of the geodesic flow on the frame bundle of a hyperbolic manifold admitting a finite measure of maximal entropy. Equivalently, let G = S0o(n, 1), \Gamma \textless{} G be a discrete subgroup of G, and G = N AK the Iwasawa decomposition of G. If the geodesic flow on \Gamma\G admits a finite measure of maximal entropy, we prove that the action of N on \Gamma\G by right multiplication admits a unique invariant measure supported on points whose A-orbit does not diverge.
