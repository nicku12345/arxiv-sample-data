We show that for the attractor (K_{1},\dots,K_{q}) of a graph directed iterated function system, for each 1\leq j\leq q and \varepsilon>0 there exits a self-similar set K\subseteq K_{j} that satisfies the strong separation condition and \dim_{H}K_{j}-\varepsilon<\dim_{H}K. We show that we can further assume convenient conditions on the orthogonal parts and similarity ratios of the defining similarities of K. Using this property as a `black box' we obtain results on a range of topics including on dimensions of projections, intersections, distance sets and sums and products of sets.
