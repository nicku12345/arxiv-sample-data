We show the existence of Venice masks (i.e. nontransitive sectional Anosov flows with dense periodic orbits), containing two equilibria on certain compact 3-manifolds. Indeed, the only known examples of venice masks have one or three singularities, and they are characterized by having two properties: are the union non disjoint of two homoclinic classes and whose intersection is the closure of the unstable manifold of a singularity. Thus, we present two type of examples containing two equilibria in which the homoclinic classes composing their maximal invariant set intersect in a very different way.
