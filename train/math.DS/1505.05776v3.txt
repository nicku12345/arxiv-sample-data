We present a new kind of normalization theorem: linearization theorem for skew products. The normal form is a skew product again, with the fiber maps linear. It appears, that even in the smooth case, the conjugacy is only H\"older continuous with respect to the base. The normalization theorem mentioned above may be applied to perturbations of skew products and to the study of new persistent properties of attractors.
