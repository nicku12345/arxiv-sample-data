We study the integrable system of first order differential equations \omega_i(v)'=\alpha_i\,\prod_{j\neq i}\omega_j(v), (1\!\leq i, j\leq\! N) as an initial value problem, with real coefficients \alpha_i and initial conditions \omega_i(0). The analysis is based on its quadratic first integrals. For each dimension N, the system defines a family of functions, generically hyperelliptic functions. When N=3, this system generalizes the classic Euler system for the reduced flow of the free rigid body problem, thus we call it N-extended Euler system (N-EES). In this Part I the cases N=4 and N=5 are studied, generalizing Jacobi elliptic functions which are defined as a 3-EES. Taking into account the nested structure of the N-EES, we propose reparametrizations of the type {\rm d}v^*=g(\omega_i)\,{\rm d}v that separate geometry from dynamic. Some of those parametrizations turn out to be generalization of the {\sl Jacobi amplitude}. In Part II we consider geometric properties of the N-system and the numeric computation of the functions involved. It will be published elsewhere.
