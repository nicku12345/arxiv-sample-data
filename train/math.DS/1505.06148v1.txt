In this paper we establish a closing property and a hyperbolic closing property for thin trapped chain hyperbolic homoclinic classes with one dimensional center in partial hyperbolicity setting. Taking advantage of theses properties, we prove that the growth rate of the number of hyperbolic periodic points is equal to the topological entropy. We also obtain that the hyperbolic periodic measures are dense in the space of invariant measures.
