We define Baker omitted value, in short bov, of an entire or meromorphic function f in the complex plane as an omitted value for which there exists r0 > 0 such that for each ball Dr(a) centered at a and with radius r satisfying 0 < r < r0, every component of the boundary of f only asymptotic value. An entire function has bov if and only if the image of every unbounded curve is unbounded. It follows that an entire function has bov whenever it has a Baker wandering domain. Functions with bov has at most one completely invariant Fatou component.
