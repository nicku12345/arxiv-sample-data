We show that the robustly transitive diffeomorphisms constructed by Bonatti and Viana have unique equilibrium states for natural classes of potentials. In particular, we characterize the SRB measure as the unique equilibrium state for a suitable geometric potential. The techniques developed are applicable to a wide class of DA diffeomorphisms, and persist under C^1 perturbations of the map. These results are an application of general machinery developed by the first and last named authors.
