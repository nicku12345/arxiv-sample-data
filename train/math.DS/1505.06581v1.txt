The problem of genealogy of permutations has been solved partially by Stefan (odd order) and Acosta-Hum\'anez \& Bernhardt (power of two). It is well known that Sharkovskii's theorem shows the relationship between the cardinal of the set of periodic points of a continuous map, but simple permutations will show the behaviour of those periodic points. Recently Abdulla et al studied the structure of minimal 4n+2-orbits of the continuous endomorphisms on the real line. This paper studies some combinatorial dynamics structures of permutations of mixed order 4n+2, describing its genealogy, using Pasting and Reversing.
