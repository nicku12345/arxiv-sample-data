Consider G=\SL_{ d }(\mathbb R) and  \Gamma=\SL_{ d }(\mathbb Z). It was recently shown by the second-named author \cite{s} that for some diagonal subgroups \{g_t\}\subset G and unipotent subgroups U\subset G, g_t-trajectories of almost all points on all U-orbits on G/\Gamma are equidistributed with respect to continuous compactly supported functions \varphi on G/\Gamma. In this paper we strengthen this result in two directions: by exhibiting an error rate of equidistribution when \varphi is smooth and compactly supported, and by proving equidistribution with respect to certain unbounded functions, namely Siegel transforms of Riemann integrable functions on \R^d. For the first part we use a method based on effective double equidistribution of g_t-translates of U-orbits, which generalizes the main result of \cite{km12}. The second part is based on Schmidt's results on counting of lattice points. Number-theoretic consequences involving spiraling of lattice approximations, extending recent work of Athreya, Ghosh and Tseng \cite{agt1}, are derived using the equidistribution result.
