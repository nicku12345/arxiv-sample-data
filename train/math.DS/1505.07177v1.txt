Let f be a partially hyperbolic diffeomorphism on a closed (i.e., compact and boundaryless) Riemannian manifold M with a uniformly compact center foliation \mathcal{W}^{c}. The relationship among topological entropy h(f), entropy of the restriction of f on the center foliation h(f, \mathcal{W}^{c}) and the growth rate of periodic center leaves p^{c}(f) is investigated. It is first shown that if a compact locally maximal invariant center set \Lambda is center topologically mixing then f|_{\Lambda} has the center specification property, i.e., any specification with a large spacing can be center shadowed by a periodic center leaf with a fine precision. Applying the center spectral decomposition and the center specification property, we show that  h(f)\leq h(f,\mathcal{W}^{c})+p^{c}(f). Moreover, if the center foliation \mathcal{W}^{c} is of dimension one, we obtain an equality h(f)= p^{c}(f).
