This paper is concerned with the study of fuzzy dynamical systems. Let (X;M; *) be a fuzzy metric space in the sense of George and Veeramani. A fuzzy discrete dynamical system is given by any fuzzy continuous self-map defined on X. We introduce the various fuzzy shadowing and fuzzy topological transitivity on a fuzzy discrete dynamical systems. Some relations between this notions have been proved.
