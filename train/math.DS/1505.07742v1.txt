We prove existence and uniqueness of equilibrium states for a family of partially hyperbolic systems, with respect to Holder continuous potentials with small variation. The family comes from the projection, on the center-unstable direction, of a family of partially hyperbolic horseshoes introduced in [D\'iaz,L., Horita,V., Rios, I., Sambarino, M., Destroying horseshoes via heterodimensional cycles: generating bifurcations inside homoclinic classes, Ergodic Theory and Dynamical Systems, 2009]. For the original three dimensional system, we consider potentials with small variation, constant on local stable manifolds, obtaining existence and uniqueness of equilibrium states.
