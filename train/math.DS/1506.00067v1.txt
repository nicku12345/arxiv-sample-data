We study the dynamics of the attractor of the doubling map with an asymmetrical hole by associating to each hole an element of the lexicographic world. A description of the topological entropy function is given. We show that the set of parameters (a,b) such that the dynamics of the mentioned attractor corresponds to a subshift of finite type is open and dense. Using the connections between this family of open dynamical systems, intermediate \beta-expansions and Lorenz maps we study the topological transitivity and the specification property for such maps.
