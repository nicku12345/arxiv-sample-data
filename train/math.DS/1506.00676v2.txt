Given a rational map of the Riemann sphere and a subset A of its Julia set, we study the A-exceptional set, that is, the set of points whose orbit does not accumulate at A. We prove that if the topological entropy of A is less than the topological entropy of the full system then the A-exceptional set has full topological entropy. Furthermore, if the Hausdorff dimension of A is smaller than the dynamical dimension of the system then the Hausdorff dimension of the A-exceptional set is larger than or equal to the dynamical dimension, with equality in the particular case when the dynamical dimension and the Hausdorff dimension coincide.   We discuss also the case of a general conformal C^{1+\alpha} dynamical system and, in particular, certain multimodal interval maps on their Julia set.
