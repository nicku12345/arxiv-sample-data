Many physical and biological systems exhibit intrinsic cyclic dynamics that are altered by random external perturbations. We examine continuous-time autonomous dynamical systems exhibiting a stable limit cycle, perturbed by additive Gaussian white noise. We derive a formal approximation for the dynamics of sample paths that stay close to the limit cycle, in terms of a phase coordinate and a deviation perpendicular to the limit cycle. To leading order in the deviation, the phase advances at the deterministic speed superimposed by a Brownian-motion-like drift. The deviation itself takes the form of an (n-1)-dimensional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. We apply these results to the case of limit cycles emerging through a supercritical Hopf bifurcation, which is widespread in ecological and epidemiological models. We derive approximation formulas for the system's stationary autocovariance and power spectral density. The latter two reflect the effects of perturbations on the temporal coherence and spectral bandwidth of perturbed limit cycles. We verify our results using numerical simulations and exemplify their application to the El Ni\~no Southern Oscillation.
