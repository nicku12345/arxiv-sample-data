The two-fold singularity has played a significant role in our understanding of uniqueness and stability in piecewise smooth dynamical systems. When a vector field is discontinuous at some hypersurface, it can become tangent to that surface from one side or the other, and tangency from both sides creates a two-fold singularity. The local flow bears a superficial resemblance to so-called {\it folded singularities} in (smooth) slow-fast systems, which arise at the intersection of attractive and repelling branches of slow invariant manifolds, important in the local study of canards and mixed mode oscillations. Here we show that these two singularities are intimately related. When the discontinuity in a piecewise smooth system is regularized (smoothed out) at a two-fold singularity, the resulting system can be mapped onto a folded singularity. The result is not obvious since it requires the presence of nonlinear or `hidden' terms at the discontinuity, which turn out to be necessary for structural stability of the regularization (or smoothing) of the discontinuity, and necessary for mapping to the folded singularity.
