We show that two inverse limits of inverse sequences of closed intervals and quasi Markov bonding functions are homeomorphic, if the inverse sequences follow the same pattern. This significantly improves Holte's result about when two inverse limits of inverse sequences with Markov interval maps as bonding functions are homeomorphic.   Our result improves Holte's result in several directions: (1) it generalizes finite Markov partitions to Markov pairs of sets that may even be uncountable, (2) it generalizes Markov interval maps I\rightarrow I to quasi Markov functions I\rightarrow J (so the domains and the codomains of the bonding functions are not necessarily the same interval), (3) we no longer require the bonding functions to be surjective, and (4) we no longer require the bonding functions to be continuous.
