In this paper, an estimation of lower bound of topological entropy for coupled-expanding systems associated with transition matrices in compact Hausdorff spaces is given. Estimations of upper and lower bounds of topological entropy for systems in compact metric spaces are obtained by their topological equi-semiconjugacy to subshifts of finite type under certain conditions.
