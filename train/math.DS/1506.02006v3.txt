Following an earlier similar conjecture of Kellendonk and Putnam, Giordano, Putnam and Skau conjectured that all minimal, free {\mathbb Z}^d actions on Cantor sets admit "small cocycles." These represent classes in H^1 that are mapped to small vectors in {\mathbb R}^d by the Ruelle-Sullivan (RS) map. We show that there exist {\mathbb Z}^d actions where no such small cocycles exist, and where the image of H^1 under RS is {\mathbb Z}^d. Our methods involve tiling spaces and shape deformations, and along the way we prove a relation between the image of RS and the set of "virtual eigenvalues," i.e. elements of {\mathbb R}^d that become topological eigenvalues of the tiling flow after an arbitrarily small change in the shapes and sizes of the tiles.
