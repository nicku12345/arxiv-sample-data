The notion of topological pressure was introduced by Ruell and also he formulated a variational principle for the topological pressure. Pesin and Pitskel introduced a definition of topological on subsets inspired by Hausdorff dimension. In this paper, we considered the topological pressure of a noncompact subset for amenable group actions and showed that under the tempered condition, we get the variational principle for topological pressure.
