The correlation integral and determinism are quantitative characteristics of a dynamical system based on the recurrence of orbits. For strongly non-chaotic interval maps, the determinism equals 1 for every small enough threshold. This means that trajectories of such systems are perfectly predictable in the infinite horizon. In this paper we study the correlation integral and determinism for the family of 2^\infty non-chaotic maps, first considered by Delahaye in 1980. The determinism in a finite horizon equals 1. However, the behaviour of the determinism in the infinite horizon is counter-intuitive. Sharp bounds on the determinism are provided.
