The similarity differential equation f'''+ff''+\beta f'(f'-1)=0 with \beta\textgreater{}0 is considered. This differential equation appears in the study of mixed convection boundary-layer flows over a vertical surface embedded in a porous medium. In order to prove the existence of solutions satisfying the boundary conditions f(0)=a\geq0, f'(0)=b\geq0 and f'(+\infty)=0 or 1, we use shooting and consider the initial value problem consisting of the differential equation and the initial conditions f(0)=a, f'(0)=b and f''(0)=c.   For 0\textless{}\beta\leq1, we prove that there exists a unique solution such that f'(+\infty)=0, and infinitely many solutions such that f'(+\infty)=1. For \beta\textgreater{}1, we give only partial results and show some differences with the previous case.
