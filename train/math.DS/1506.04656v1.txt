Our original results refer to multivariate recurrences: discrete multitime diagonal recurrence, bivariate recurrence, trivariate recurrence, solutions tailored to particular situations, second order multivariate recurrences, characteristic equation, and multivariate diagonal recurrences of superior order. We find the solutions, we clarify the structural background and provides short, conceptual proofs. The original results include a new point of view on discrete minimal submanifolds.
