In this paper we revisit uniformly hyperbolic basic sets and the domination of Oseledets splittings at periodic points. We prove that periodic points with simple Lyapunov spectrum are dense in non-trivial basic pieces of Cr-residual diffeomorphisms on three-dimensional manifolds (r >= 1). In the case of the C1-topology we can prove that either all periodic points of a hyperbolic basic piece for a diffeomorphism f have simple spectrum C1- robustly (in which case f has a finest dominated splitting into one-dimensional sub-bundles and all Lyapunov exponent functions of f are continuous in the weak*-topology) or it can be C1-approximated by an equidimensional cycle associated to periodic points with robust different signatures. The later can be used as a mechanism to guarantee the coexistence of infinitely many periodic points with different signatures.
