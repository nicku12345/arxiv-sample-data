Let M be a 2d-dimensional compact connected Riemannian manifold and \omega be a symplectic form on M. In this paper, we prove that a symplectic diffeomorphism, with all Lyapunov exponent zero for almost everywhere, can be C^1 approximated by one with a positive Lyapunov exponent for a positive-measured subset of M. That is, the set \[ \left\{ f\in \mathcal{S}ym^1_{\omega}(M)\,| \begin{array}{ll} &\mbox{The largest Lyapunov exponent }\lambda_1(f,\,x)>0\\ &\mbox{ for a positive measure set } \end{array} \right\} \] is dense in \mathcal{S}ym^1_{\omega}(M). \end{abstract} \end{center}
