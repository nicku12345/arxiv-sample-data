We consider a multivalued function of the form H\_{\varepsilon}=P\_{\varepsilon}^{\alpha\_0}\prod^{k}\_{i=1}P\_i^{\alpha\_i}, P\_i\in\mathbb{R}[x,y], \alpha\_i\in\mathbb{R}^{\ast}\_+, which is a Darboux first integral of polynomial one-form \omega=M\_{\varepsilon}\frac{dH\_{\varepsilon}}{H\_{\varepsilon}}=0, M\_{\varepsilon}=P\_{\varepsilon}\prod^{k}\_{i=1}P\_i. We assume, for \varepsilon=0, that the polycyle \{H\_0=H=0\} has only cuspidal singularity which we assume at the origin and other singularities are saddles.   We consider families of Darboux first integrals unfolding H\_{\varepsilon} (and its cuspidal point) and pseudo-Abelian integrals associated to these unfolding. Under some conditions we show the existence of uniform local bound for the number of zeros of these pseudo-Abelian integrals.
