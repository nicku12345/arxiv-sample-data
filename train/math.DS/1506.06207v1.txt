In this paper we consider the shadowing property for iterated function systems,(IFS). Some important result about shadowing property are extended to iterated function systems. For example, we define topological conjugacy for IFS and prove that if F and G are two topological conjugate IFS then F has the shadowing property iff so does G. More- over, we introduce some examples and investigate the relationship between the original shadowing property and shadowing property for IFS.
