We analyze the rel leaf of the Arnoux-Yoccoz translation surface in genus 3. We show that the leaf is dense in the stratum \mathcal{H}(2,2)^{\mathrm{odd}} but that the real-rel trajectory of the surface is divergent. On this real-rel trajectory, the vertical foliation of one surface is invariant under a pseudo-Anosov map (and in particular is uniquely ergodic), but the vertical foliations on all other surfaces are completely periodic.
