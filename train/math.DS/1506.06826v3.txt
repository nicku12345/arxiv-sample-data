Given a surface M and a Borel probability measure \nu on the group of C^2-diffeomorphisms of M, we study \nu-stationary probability measures on M. We prove for hyperbolic stationary measures the following trichotomy: either the stable distributions are non-random, the measure is SRB, or the measure is supported on a finite set and is hence almost-surely invariant. In the proof of the above results, we study skew products with surface fibers over a measure preserving transformations equipped with a decreasing sub-\sigma-algebra \hat {\mathcal F} and derive a related result. A number of applications of our main theorem are presented.
