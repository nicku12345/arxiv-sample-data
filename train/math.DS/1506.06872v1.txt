Let X be a dendrite with set of endpoints E(X) closed and let f:~X \to X be a continuous map with zero topological entropy. Let P(f) be the set of periodic points of f. We prove that if L is an infinite \omega-limit set of f then L\cap P(f)\subset E(X)^{\prime}, where E(X)^{\prime} is the set of all accumulations points of E(X). Furthermore, if E(X) is countable and L is uncountable then L\cap P(f)=\emptyset. We also show that if E(X)^{\prime} is finite then any uncountable \omega-limit set of f has a decomposition and as a consequence if f has a Li-Yorke pair (x,y) with \omega\_f(x) or \omega\_f(y) is uncountable then f is Li-Yorke chaotic.
