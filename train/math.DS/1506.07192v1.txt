The aim of this note is to point out some observations concerning modified power entropy of \Z- and \N-actions. First, we provide an elementary example showing that this quantity is sensitive to transient dynamics, and therefore does not satisfy a variational principle. Further, we show that modified power entropy is not suitable to detect the break of equicontinuity which takes place during the transition from almost periodic to almost automorphic minimal systems. In this respect, it differs from power entropy and amorphic complexity, which are two further topological invariants for zero entropy systems (`slow entropies'). Finally, we construct an example of an irregular Toeplitz flow with zero modified power entropy.
