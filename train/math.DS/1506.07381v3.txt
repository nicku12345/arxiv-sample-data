We consider large but finite systems of identical agents on the line with up to next nearest neighbor asymmetric coupling. Each agent is modelled by a linear second order differential equation, linearly coupled to up to four of its neighbors. The only restriction we impose is that the equations are decentralized. In this generality we give the conditions for stability of these systems. For stable systems, we find the response to a change of course by the leader. This response is at least linear in the size of the flock. Depending on the system parameters, two types of solutions have been found: damped oscillations and reflectionless waves. The latter is a novel result and a feature of systems with at least next nearest neighbor interactions. Analytical predictions are tested in numerical simulations.
