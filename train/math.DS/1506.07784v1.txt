Recent works related to Palis conjecture of J. Yang, S. Crovisier, M. Sambarino and D. Yang showed that any aperiodic class of a C^1-generic diffeomorphism far away from homoclinic bifurcations (or homoclinic tangencies) is partially hyperbolic. We show in this paper that, generically, a non-trivial dominated splitting implies partial hyperbolicity for an aperiodic class if it is Lyapunov stable. More precisely, for C^1-generic diffeomorphisms, if a Lyapunov stable aperiodic class has a non-trivial dominated splitting E\oplus F, then one of the two bundles is hyperbolic (either E is contracted or F is expanded).
