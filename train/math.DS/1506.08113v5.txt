Given a discrete subgroup \Gamma of PU(1,n) it acts by isometries on the unit complex ball \Bbb{H}^n_{\Bbb{C}}, in this setting a lot of work has been done in order to understand the action of the group. However when we look at the action of \Gamma on all of  \Bbb{P}^n_{\Bbb{C}} little or nothing is known, in this paper study the action in the whole projective space and we are able to show that its equicontinuity agree with its Kulkarni discontuity set. Morever, in the non-elementary case, this set turns out to be the largest open set on which the group acts properly and discontinuously and can be described as the complement of the union of all complex projective hyperplanes in  \Bbb{P}^n_{\Bbb{C}} which are tangent to \partial \Bbb{H}^n_{\Bbb{C}} at points in the Chen-Greenberg limit set \Lambda_{CG}(\Gamma).
