This paper deals with asymptotic stability of a class of dynamical systems in terms of smooth Lyapunov pairs. We point out that well known converse Lyapunov results for differential inclusions cannot be applied to this class of dynamical systems. Following an abstract approach we put an assumption on the trajectories of the dynamical systems which demands for any trajectory the existence of a neighboring trajectory such that their difference grows linearly in time and distance of the starting points. Under this assumption, we prove the existence of a C^\infty-smooth Lyapunov pair. We also show that this assumption is satisfied by differential inclusions defined by Lipschitz continuous set-valued maps taking nonempty, compact and convex values.
