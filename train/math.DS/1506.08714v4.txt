Let M be a d\times d contracting matrix. In this paper we consider the self-affine iterated function system \{Mv-u, Mv+u\}, where u is a cyclic vector. Our main result is as follows: if |\det M|\ge 2^{-1/d}, then the attractor A_M has non-empty interior.   We also consider the set \mathcal U_M of points in A_M which have a unique address. We show that unless M belongs to a very special (non-generic) class, the Hausdorff dimension of \mathcal U_M is positive. For this special class the full description of \mathcal U_M is given as well.   This paper continues our work begun in two previous papers.
