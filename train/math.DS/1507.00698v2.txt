We show that for any finite configuration of closed curves \Gamma\subset \mathbb{R}^2, one can construct an explicit planar polynomial vector field that realizes \Gamma, up to homeomorphism, as the set of its limit cycles with prescribed periods, multiplicities and stabilities. The only obstruction given on this data is the obvious compatibility relation between the stabilities and the parity of the multiplicities. The constructed vector fields are Darboux integrable and admit a polynomial inverse integrating factor.
