We give a sufficient condition for the simplex of invariant measures for a hereditary system to be Poulsen. In particular, we show that this simplex is Poulsen in case of positive entropy \mathscr{B}-free systems. We also give an example of a positive entropy hereditary system whose simplex of invariant measures is not Poulsen.
