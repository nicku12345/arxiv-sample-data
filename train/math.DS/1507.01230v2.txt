We develop the Bohl spectrum for nonautonomous linear differential equation on a half line, which is a spectral concept that lies between the Lyapunov and the Sacker--Sell spectrum. We prove that the Bohl spectrum is given by the union of finitely many intervals, and we show by means of an explicit example that the Bohl spectrum does not coincide with the Sacker--Sell spectrum in general. We demonstrate for this example that any higher-order nonlinear perturbation is exponentially stable, although this not evident from the Sacker--Sell spectrum. We also analyze in detail situations in which the Bohl spectrum is identical to the Sacker-Sell spectrum.
