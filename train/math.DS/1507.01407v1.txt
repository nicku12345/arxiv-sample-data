Multiscale modelling methodologies build macroscale models of materials with complicated fine microscale structure. We propose a methodology to derive boundary conditions for the macroscale model of a prototypical non-linear heat exchanger. The derived macroscale boundary conditions improve the accuracy of macroscale model. We verify the new boundary conditions by numerical methods. The techniques developed here can be adapted to a wide range of multiscale reaction-diffusion-advection systems.
