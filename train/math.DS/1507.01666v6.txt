For the time-one map f of a contact Anosov flow on a compact Riemann manifold M, satisfying a certain regularity condition, we show that given a Gibbs measure on M, a sufficiently large Pesin regular set P_0 and an arbitrary \delta \in (0,1), there exist positive constants C and c such that for any integer n \geq 1, the measure of the set of those x\in M with f^k(x) \notin P_0 for at least \delta n values of k = 0,1, \ldots,n-1 does not exceed C e^{-cn}.
