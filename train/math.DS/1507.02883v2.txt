In the planar N-center problem, for a non-trivial free homotopy class of the configuration space satisfying certain mild condition, we show that there is at least one collision free T-periodic solution for any positive T. We use the direct method of calculus of variations and the main difficulty is to show that minimizers under certain topological constraints are free of collision.
