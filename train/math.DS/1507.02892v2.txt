In a preprint by Montgomery \cite{Mo99}, the author attempted to prove the existence of a shape space Figure-8 solution of the Newtonian three body problem with two equal masses (it looks like a figure 8 in the shape space, which is different from the famous Figure-8 solution with three equal masses \cite{CM00}). Unfortunately there is an error in the proof and the problem is still open.   Consider the \alpha-homogeneous Newton-type potential, 1/r^{\alpha}, using action minimization method, we prove the existence of this solution, for \alpha \in (1,2); for \alpha=1 (the Newtonian potential), an extra condition is required, which unfortunately seems hard to verify at this moment.
