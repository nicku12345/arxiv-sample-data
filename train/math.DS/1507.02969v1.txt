In this paper we prove the continuity of all Lyapunov exponents, as well as the continuity of the Oseledets decomposition, for a class of irreducible cocycles over strongly mixing Markov shifts. Moreover, gaps in the Lyapunov spectrum lead to a H\"older modulus of continuity for these quantities. This result is an application of the abstract continuity theorems obtained in [4], and generalizes a theorem of E. Le Page on the H\"older continuity of the maximal LE for one-parameter families of strongly irreducible and contracting cocycles over a Bernoulli shift.   This is a draft of a chapter in our forthcoming research monograph [4].
