We consider an abstract space of measurable linear cocycles and we assume the availability in this space of some appropriate uniform large deviation type estimates. Under these hypotheses we establish the continuity of the Oseledets filtration and decomposition as functions of the cocycle. The same assumptions lead in [6] to a general continuity theorem for the Lyapunov exponents. This result and other technical estimates derived in [6], along with the inductive scheme based on the Avalanche Principle, are the main ingredients of the arguments in this paper.   We also give a new proof of the classical Multiplicative Ergodic Theorem of V. Oseledets, using the Avalanche Principle (AP).   This is a draft of a chapter in our forthcoming research monograph [6].
