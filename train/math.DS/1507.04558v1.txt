The goal of this paper is to describe the connections between Perron-Frobenius theory and vertex maps on graphs. In particular, it is shown how Perron-Frobenius theory gives results about the sets of integers that can arise as periods of periodic orbits, about the concepts of transitivity and topological mixing, and about horseshoes and topological entropy.   This is a preprint. The final version will appear in the Journal of Difference Equations and Applications.
