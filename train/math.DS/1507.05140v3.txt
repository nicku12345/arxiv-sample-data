In 1987, J. H. Elton, has proved the first fundamental result in convergence of IFS, the Elton's Ergodic Theorem. In this work we prove the natural extension of this theorem to the projected Hutchinson measure \mu_{\alpha} associated to a GIFSpdp \mathcal{S}=\left(X, (\phi_j:X^{m} \to X)_{j=0,1, ..., n-1}, (p_j)_{j=0,1, ..., n-1}\right), in a compact metric space (X,d). More precisely, the average along of the trajectories x_{n}(a) of the GIFS, starting in any initial points x_0, ..., x_{m-1} \in X satisfies, for any f \in C(X , \mathbb{R}), \lim_{N\to +\infty} \frac{1}{N}\sum_{n=0 }^{N-1} f(x_{n}(a)) = \int_{X} f(t) d\mu_{\alpha}(t), for almost all a \in \Omega=\{0,1, ..., n-1\}^{\mathbb{N}}, the symbolic space. Additionally, we give some examples and applications to Chaos Games and Nonautonomous Dynamical Systems defined by finite difference equations.
