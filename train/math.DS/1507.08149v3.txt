In this paper, we manage to apply Schmidt games to certain non-algebraic dynamical systems. More precisely, we show that the set of points with non-dense forward orbit under a C^2-Anosov diffeomorphism with conformality on unstable manifolds is a winning set for Schmidt games. It is also proved that for a C^{1+\theta}-expanding endomorphism the set of points with non-dense forward orbit is a winning set for certain variants of Schmidt games.
