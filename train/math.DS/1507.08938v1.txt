It is proved that bounded solutions of modified (\theta-twisted) cohomological equations for expanding circle maps are \theta-H\"{o}lder continuous but are not (\theta+\gamma)-H\"{o}lder continuous for every \gamma>0 at almost every point. This gives new examples of "nonlinear" Weierstrass-like functions for which the optimal \holder exponent at most points is known.
