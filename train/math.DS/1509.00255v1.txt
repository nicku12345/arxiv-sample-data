We give sufficient conditions for intervals (a,b) such that the associated open dynamical system for the doubling map is intrinsically ergodic. We also show that the set of parameters (a,b) \in (\frac{1}{4}, \frac{1}{2}) \times (\frac{1}{2},\frac{3}{4}) such that the attractor (\Lambda_{(a,b)}, f_{(a,b)}) is intrinsically ergodic has full Lebesgue measure and we construct a set of points where intrinsic ergodicity does not hold.
