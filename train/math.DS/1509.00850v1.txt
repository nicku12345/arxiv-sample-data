The dynamics of the second order rational difference equation \displaystyle{z_{n+1}=\frac{\alpha + \beta z_{n}+ \gamma z_{n-1}}{A + B z_n + C z_{n-1}}} with complex parameters and arbitrary complex initial conditions is investigated. In the complex set up, the local asymptotic stability and boundedness are studied vividly for this difference equation. Several interesting characteristics of the solutions of this equation, using computations, which does not arise when we consider the same equation with positive real parameters and initial conditions are shown. The chaotic solutions of the difference equation is absolutely new feature in the complex set up which is also shown in this article. Some of the interesting observations led us to pose some open interesting problems regarding chaotic and higher order periodic solutions and global asymptotic convergence of this equation.
