For any subshift, define F_X(n) to be the collection of distinct follower sets of words of length n in X. Based on a similar result of the second and third authors, we conjecture that if there exists an n for which |F_X(n)| \leq n, then X is sofic. In this paper, we prove several results related to this conjecture, including verifying it for n \leq 3, proving that the conjecture is true for a large class of coded subshifts, and showing that if there exists n for which |F_X(n)| \leq \log_2(n+1), then X is sofic.
