Let \Gamma be a sofic group with a copy of \mathbb{Z} in its center. We construct an uncountable family of pairwise nonisomorphic measure-preserving \Gamma actions with completely positive entropy, none of which is a factor of a Bernoulli shift. Our construction shows that the relation of isomorphism among completely positive entropy \Gamma actions is not smooth, in contrast with the relation of isomorphism among Bernoulli shifts.
