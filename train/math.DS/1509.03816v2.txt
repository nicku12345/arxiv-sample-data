We consider Anosov actions of a Lie group G of dimension k on a closed manifold of dimension k+n.We introduce the notion of Nil-Anosov action of G (which includes the case where G is nilpotent) and establishes the invariance by the entire group Gof the associated stable and unstable foliations. We then prove a spectral decomposition Theoremfor such an action when the group G is nilpotent. Finally, we focus on the case where G is nilpotent andthe unstable bundle has codimension one. We prove that in this case the action is a Nil-extensionover an Anosov action of an abelian Lie group. In particular:i) if n \geq 3, then the action is topologically transitive,ii) if n=2, then the action is a Nil-extension over an Anosov flow.
