We consider a symbolic coding for geodesics on the family of Veech surfaces (translation surfaces rich with affine symmetries) recently discovered by Bouw and Moeller. These surfaces, as noticed by Hooper, can be realized by cutting and pasting a collection of semi-regular polygons. We characterize the set of symbolic sequences (cutting sequences) that arise by coding linear trajectories by the sequence of polygon sides crossed. We provide a full characterization for the closure of the set of cutting sequences, in the spirit of the classical characterization of Sturmian sequences and the recent characterization of Smillie-Ulcigrai of cutting sequences of linear trajectories on regular polygons. The characterization is in terms of a system of finitely many substitutions (also known as an S-adic presentation), governed by a one-dimensional continued fraction-like map. As in the Sturmian and regular polygon case, the characterization is based on renormalization and the definition of a suitable combinatorial derivation operator. One of the novelties is that derivation is done in two steps, without directly using Veech group elements, but by exploiting an affine diffeomorphism that maps a Bouw-Moeller surface to the dual Bouw-M\"oller surface in the same Teichmueller disk. As a technical tool, we crucially exploit the presentation of Bouw-M\"oller surfaces via Hooper diagrams.
