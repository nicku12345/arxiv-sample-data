We show that strong coincidences of a certain many choices of control points are equivalent to overlap coincidence for the suspension tiling of Pisot substitution. The result is valid for degree \ge 2 as well, under certain topological conditions. This result gives a converse of the paper by Akiyama-Lee and elucidates the tight relationship between two coincidences.
