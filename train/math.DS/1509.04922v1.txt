We characterize product Anosov diffeomorphisms in terms of the two-sided limit shadowing property. It is proved that an Anosov diffeomorphism is a product Anosov diffeomorphism if and only if any lift to the universal covering has the unique two-sided limit shadowing property. Then we introduce two maps in a suitable Banach space such that fixed points of these maps are related with shadowing orbits on the universal covering.
