In symmetric Hamiltonian systems, relative equilibria usually arise in continuous families. The geometry of these families in the setting of free actions of the symmetry group is well-understood. Here we consider the question for non-free actions. Some results are already known in this direction, and we use the so called bundle equations to provide a systematic treatment of this question which both consolidates the known results, extending the scope of the results to deal with non-compact symmetry groups, as well as producing new results. Specifically we address questions about the stability, persistence and bifurcations of these relative equilibria.
