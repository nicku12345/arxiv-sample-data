We construct partially hyperbolic diffeomorphisms having semi-local robustly transitive sets with C^1-robust cycles of any co-index. These constructions also provide a new method to create C^2-robust homoclinic, equidimensional and heterodimensional tangencies of large codimension in dimension d\geq 4. The method to generate robust homoclinic and equidimensional tangencies also works in the symplectic setting. Thus, these are mechanisms for the robust non-hyperbolicity of symplectomorphisms in higher dimension.
