We consider families of fast-slow skew product maps of the form \begin{align*} x_{n+1} = x_n+\epsilon a(x_n,y_n,\epsilon), \quad y_{n+1} = T_\epsilon y_n, \end{align*} where T_\epsilon is a family of nonuniformly expanding maps, and prove averaging and rates of averaging for the slow variables x as \epsilon\to0. Similar results are obtained also for continuous time systems \begin{align*} \dot x = \epsilon a(x,y,\epsilon), \quad \dot y = g_\epsilon(y). \end{align*} Our results include cases where the family of fast dynamical systems consists of intermittent maps, unimodal maps (along the Collet-Eckmann parameters) and Viana maps.
