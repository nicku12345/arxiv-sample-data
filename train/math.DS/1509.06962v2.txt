Multi-valued logical models can be used to describe biological networks on a high level of abstraction based on the network structure and logical parameters capturing regulatory effects. Interestingly, the dynamics of two distinct models need not necessarily be different, which might hint at either only non-functional characteristics distinguishing the models or at different possible implementations for the same behaviour. Here, we study the conditions allowing for such effects by analysing classes of dynamically equivalent models and both structurally maximal and minimal representatives of such classes. Finally, we present an efficient algorithm that constructs a minimal representative of the respective class of a given multi-valued model.
