Given a rational map R, we consider the complement of the postcritical set S_R. In this paper we discuss the existence of invariant Beltrami differentials supported on a R invariant subset A of S_R. Under some geometrical restrictions, either on the hyperbolic geometry of A or on the asymptotic behavior of infinitesimal geodesics of the Teichm\"uller space of S_R, we show the absence of invariant Beltrami differentials supported on A. In particular, we show that if A has finite hyperbolic area, then A can not support invariant Beltrami differentials except in the case where R is a Latt\`es map.
