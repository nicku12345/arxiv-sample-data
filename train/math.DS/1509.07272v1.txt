We apply set-valued numerical methods to compute an accurate enclosure of the rotation number. The described algorithm is supplemented with a method of proving the existence of periodic points, which is used to check the rationality of the rotation number. A few numerical experiments are presented to show that the implementation of interval methods produces a good enclosure of the rotation number of a circle map.
