The purpose of this article is to extend the earliest results of A.A. Brudno, connecting topological entropy of a subshift X over \mathbb{N} to the Kolmogorov complexity of words in X, to subshifts over computable groups that posses computable F{\o}lner monotilings, which we introduce in this work. The classical examples of such groups are the groups \mathbb{Z}^d and the groups of upper-triangular matrices with integer entries. Following the work of B. Weiss we show that the class of such groups is closed under group extensions.
