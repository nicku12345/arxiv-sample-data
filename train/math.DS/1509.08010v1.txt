Let B\subset \mathbb{N} and let \eta\in \{0,1\}^\mathbb{Z} be the characteristic function of the set F_B:=\mathbb{Z}\setminus\bigcup_{b}b\mathbb{Z} of B-free numbers. Consider (S,X_\eta), where X_\eta is the closure of the orbit of \eta under the left shift S. When B=\{p^2 : p\in P\}, (S,X_\eta) was studied by Sarnak. This case + some generalizations, including the case (*) of B infinite, coprime with \sum_{b}1/b<\infty, were discussed by several authors. For general B, contrary to (*), we may have X_\eta\subsetneq X_B:=\{x\in \{0,1\}^\mathbb{Z} : |\text{supp }x\bmod b|\leq b-1 \forall_b\}. Also, X_\eta may not be hereditary (heredity means that if x\in X and y\leq x coordinatewise then y\in X). We show that \eta is quasi-generic for a natural measure \nu_\eta. We solve the problem of proximality by showing first that X_\eta has a unique minimal (Toeplitz) subsystem. Moreover B-free system is proximal iff B contains an infinite coprime set. B is taut when \delta(F_B)<\delta(F_{B\setminus \{b\} }) for each b. We give a characterization of taut B in terms of the support of \nu_\eta. Moreover, for any B there exists a taut B' with \nu_\eta=\nu_{\eta'}. For taut sets B,B', we have B=B' iff X_B=X_{B'}. For each B there is a taut B' with \tilde{X}_{\eta'}\subset \tilde{X}_\eta and all invariant measures for (S,\tilde{X}_\eta) live on \tilde{X}_{\eta'}. (S,\tilde{X}_\eta) is shown to be intrinsically ergodic for all B. We give a description of all invariant measures for (S,\tilde{X}_\eta). The topological entropies of (S,\tilde{X}_\eta) and (S,X_B) are both equal to \overline{d}(F_B). We show that for a subclass of taut B-free systems proximality is the same as heredity. Finally, we give applications in number theory on gaps between consecutive B-free numbers. We apply our results to the set of abundant numbers.
