In this paper a model reduction technique is introduced for piecewise-smooth (PWS) vector fields, whose trajectories fall into a Banach space, but the domain of definition of the vector fields is a non-dense subset of the Banach space. The vector fields depend on a parameter that can assume different discrete values in two parts of the phase space and a continuous family of values on the boundary that separates the two parts of the phase space. In essence the parameter parametrizes the possible vector fields on the boundary. The problem is to find one or more values of the parameter so that the solution of the PWS system on the boundary satisfies certain requirements. In this paper we require continuous solutions. Motivated by the properties of applications, we assume that when the parameter is forced to switch between the two discrete values, trajectories become discontinuous. Discontinuous trajectories exist in systems whose domain of definition is non-dense. It is shown that under our assumptions the trajectories of such PWS systems have unique forward-time continuation when the parameter of the system switches. A finite-dimensional reduced order model is constructed, which accounts for the discontinuous trajectories. It is shown that this model retains uniqueness of solutions and other properties of the original PWS system. The model reduction technique is illustrated on a nonlinear bowed string model.
