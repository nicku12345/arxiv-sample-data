We prove the non integrability of the colinear 3 and 4 body problem, for any masses positive masses. To deal with resistant cases, we present strong integrability criterions for 3 dimensional homogeneous potentials of degree -1, and prove that such cases cannot appear in the 4 body problem. Following the same strategy, we present a simple proof of non integrability for the planar n body problem. Eventually, we present some integrable cases of the n body problem restricted to some invariant vector spaces.
