In this paper we consider dynamical properties of set-valued mappings and their implications on the associated inverse limit space. Specifically, we define the specification property and topological entropy for set-valued functions and prove some elementary results of these properties. We end with a few results regarding invariant measures for set-valued functions and their associated inverse limits.
