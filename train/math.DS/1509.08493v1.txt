The group of automorphisms of a symbolic dynamical system is countable, but often very large. For example, for a mixing subshift of finite type, the automorphism group contains isomorphic copies of the free group on two generators and the direct sum of countably many copies of \mathbb{Z}. In contrast, the group of automorphisms of a symbolic system of zero entropy seems to be highly constrained. Our main result is that the automorphism group of any minimal subshift of stretched exponential growth with exponent <1/2, is amenable (as a countable discrete group). For shifts of polynomial growth, we further show that any finitely generated, torsion free subgroup of Aut(X) is virtually nilpotent.
