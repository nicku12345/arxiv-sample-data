In this paper, we consider non-normal numbers occurring in dynamical systems fulfilling the specification property. It has been shown that in this case the set of non-normal numbers has measure zero. In the present papers we show that a smaller set, namely the set of particularly non-normal numbers, has full Hausdorff dimension. A particularly non-normal number is a number x such that there exist two digits, one whose limiting frequency in x exists and another one whose limiting frequency in x does not exist.
