We show that if (X,\mathcal{X},\mu,S,T) is an ergodic measure preserving system with commuting transformations S and T, then the average \[\frac{1}{N^3} \sum_{i,j,k=0}^{N-1} f_0(S^j T^k x) f_1 (S^{i+j} T^k x) f_2 (S^j T^{i+k} x)\] converges for \mu-a.e. x\in X as N\to \infty for f_0,f_1, f_2\in L^\infty(\mu). We also show that if (X,\mathcal{X},\mu,S,T) is a measurable distal system, the average \[ \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=0}^{N-1} f_1 (S^i x) f_2 (T^i x) \] converges for \mu-a.e. x\in X as N\to \infty for f_1,f_2\in L^{\infty}(\mu).
