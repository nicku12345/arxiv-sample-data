We present results on the broadband nature of the power spectrum S(\omega), \omega\in(0,2\pi), for a large class of nonuniformly expanding maps with summable and nonsummable decay of correlations. In particular, we consider a class of intermittent maps f:[0,1]\to[0,1] with f(x)\approx x^{1+\gamma} for x\approx 0, where \gamma\in(0,1). Such maps have summable decay of correlations when \gamma\in(0,\frac12), and S(\omega) extends to a continuous function on [0,2\pi] by the classical Wiener-Khintchine Theorem. We show that S(\omega) is typically bounded away from zero for H\"older observables.   Moreover, in the nonsummable case \gamma\in[\frac12,1), we show that S(\omega) is defined almost everywhere with a continuous extension \tilde S(\omega) defined on (0,2\pi), and \tilde S(\omega) is typically nonvanishing.
