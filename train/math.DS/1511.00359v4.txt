In [Acta Math. Univ. Comenianae Vol. LXXX, 1 (2011), pp. 63--70], Yang, Chen and Shi examined the system of difference equations   \[   x_n=\frac{a}{y_{n-p}},\qquad y_n=\frac{by_{n-p}}{x_{n-q}y_{n-q}},\qquad n=0,1,\ldots,   \] where q is a positive integer with p < q, p \nmid q, p \geq 3 is an odd number, both a and b are nonzero real constants, and the initial values x_{-q+1},x_{-q+2},\ldots, x_0,y_{-q+1},y_{-q+2},\ldots,y_0 are nonzero real numbers. At the end of their note, they posted a question regarding the behaviour of solutions of the given system when p is even. More precisely, they asked what the solutions of the system may look like if p is even. In this note we answer this question raised by the authors. Particularly, we show that the system may or may not admit a periodic solution depending on the coprimality of the parameters p and q and on the parity of the integer p/\gcd(p,q).
