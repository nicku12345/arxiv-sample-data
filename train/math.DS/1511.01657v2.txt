We prove a quenched limiting law for random measures on subshifts at periodic points. We consider a family of measures \{\mu_\omega\}_{\omega\in\Omega}, where the `driving space' \Omega is equipped with a probability measure which is invariant under a transformation \theta. We assume that the fibred measures \mu_\omega satisfy a generalised invariance property and are \psi-mixing. We then show that for almost every \omega the return times to cylinders A_n at periodic points are in the limit compound Poisson distributed for a parameter \vartheta which is given by the escape rate at the periodic point.
