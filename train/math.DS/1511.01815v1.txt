For small \epsilon>0, the system \dot x = \epsilon, \dot z = h(x,z,\epsilon)z, with h(x,0,0)<0 for x<0 and h(x,0,0)>0 for x>0, admits solutions that approach the x-axis while x<0 and are repelled from it when x>0. The limiting attraction and repulsion points are given by the well-known entry-exit function. For h(x,z,\epsilon)z replaced by h(x,z,\epsilon)z^2, we explain this phenomenon using geometric singular perturbation theory. We also show that the linear case can be reduced to the quadratic case, and we discuss the smoothness of the return map to the line z=z_0, z_0>0, in the limit \epsilon\to0.
