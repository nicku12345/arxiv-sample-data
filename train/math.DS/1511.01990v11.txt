Let P be a Borel probability measure on \mathbb R^2 supported by the Cantor dusts generated by a set of 4^u,\ u\geq 1, contractive similarity mappings satisfying the strong separation condition. For this probability measure, we determine the optimal sets of n-means and the nth quantization errors for all n\geq 2. In addition, it is shown that though the quantization dimension of the measure P is known, the quantization coefficient for P does not exist.
