For a given topological dynamical system (X,T) over a compact set X with a metric d, the "variational principle" states that \begin{equation*} \sup_{\mu}h_\mu(T) = h(T) = h_d(T), \end{equation*} where h_\mu(T) is the Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy, with the supremum taken over every T-invariant probability measure, h_d(T) is the Bowen entropy, and h(T) is the topological entropy as defined by Adler, Konheim and McAndrew. In [9], the concept of topological entropy was adapted for the case where T is a proper map and X is locally compact separable and metrizable, and the variational principle was extended to \begin{equation*} \sup_{\mu}h_\mu(T) = h(T) = \min_d h_d(T), \end{equation*} where the minimum is taken over every distance compatible with the topology of X. In the present work, we dropped the properness assumption, extending the above result for any continuous map T.   We also apply our results to extend some previous formulas for the topological entropy of continuous endomorphisms of connected Lie groups proved in [4]. In particular, we prove that any linear transformation T: V \to V over a finite dimensional vector space V has null topological entropy.
