The Hodgkin-Huxley equations constitute one of the more realistic neuronal models in literature and the most accepted one. It is well known that, depending on the value of the external stimuli current, it exhibits periodic solutions, both stable and unstable. Our aim is to detect and characterize such periodic solutions, exploiting a robust and manageable technique, mainly based on harmonic balance method
