We define a random walk adic transformation associated to an aperiodic random walk on G=\mathbb{Z}^{k}\times\mathbb{R}^{D-k} driven by a \beta-transformation and study its ergodic properties. In particular, this transformation is conservative, ergodic, infinite measure preserving and we prove that it is asymptotically distributionally stable and bounded rationally ergodic. Related earlier work appears in [AS] and [ANSS] for random walk adic transformations associated to an aperiodic random walk driven by a subshift of finite type.
