We study the dynamical behaviour of points in the boundaries of simply connected invariant Baker domains U of meromorphic maps f with a finite degree on U. We prove that if f|_U is of hyperbolic or simply parabolic type, then almost every point in the boundary of U with respect to harmonic measure escapes to infinity under iteration. On the contrary, if f|_U is of doubly parabolic type, then almost every point in the boundary of U with respect to harmonic measure has dense forward trajectory in the boundary of U, in particular the set of escaping points in the boundary of U has harmonic measure zero. We also present some extensions of the results to the case when f has infinite degree on U, including classical Fatou example.
