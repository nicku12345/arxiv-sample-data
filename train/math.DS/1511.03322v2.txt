This paper studies properties of a Renormalization Operator for potentials in symbolic dynamics. These operators first appeared in \cite{BLL} and the link with substitutions was done in \cite{BL1}. Their fixed points are natural candidates to have pathologic behavior such as phase transitions. If R is such an operator, we study the convergence of R^{n}(\varphi) to the non-nul fixed point.   We define the family of marked substitutions, which contains the Thue-Morse substitution, and show that the associated renormalization operators on potentials admits a unique non-nul continuous fixed point. Then, we show that R^{n}(\varphi) converges to the fixed point as soon as \varphi has the right germ close to \mathbb K.
