This paper concerns the compact group extension \[ f:\mathbb{T}^2\to \mathbb{T}^2,\quad f (x,s)= (E(x), s+\tau(x)\ \text{mod }1) \] of an expanding map E:\mathbb{S}^1\to \mathbb{S}^1. The dynamics of f and its stochastic perturbations have previously been studied under the so-called partial captivity condition. Here we prove a supplementary result that shows that partial captivity is a \mathscr{C}^r generic condition on \tau, once we fix E.
