The dynamics of the second order rational difference equation \displaystyle{z_{n+1}=\frac{\alpha + \alpha z_{n}+\beta z_{n-1}}{1+z_{n}}} with complex parameters \alpha, \beta and arbitrary complex initial conditions is investigated. The same difference equation is well studied with positive real parameters and initial values and one of the main results on trichotomy of parameters is revisited in the complex set-up and the similar result is found to be true. In addition, the chaotic solutions of the equation is fetched out in the complex set-up which was absent in the real scenario.
