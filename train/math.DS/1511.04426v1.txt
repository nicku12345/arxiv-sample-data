Conley indices and Morse decompositions of flows can be found by using algorithms which rigorously analyze discrete dynamical systems. This usually involves integrating a time discretization of the flow using interval arithmetic. We compare the old idea of fixing a time step as a parameters to a time step continuously varying in phase space. We present an example where this second strategy necessarily yields better numerical outputs and prove that our outputs yield a valid Morse decomposition of the given flow.
