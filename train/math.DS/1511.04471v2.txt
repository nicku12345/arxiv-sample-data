This paper surveys recent results on classifying partially hyperbolic diffeomorphisms. This includes the construction of branching foliations and leaf conjugacies on three-dimensional manifolds with solvable fundamental group. Classification results in higher-dimensional settings are also discussed. The paper concludes with an overview of the construction of new partially hyperbolic examples derived from Anosov flows.
