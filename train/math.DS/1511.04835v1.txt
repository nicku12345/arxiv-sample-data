In this paper we study existence of Normally Hyperbolic Invariant Laminations (NHIL) for a nearly integrable system given by the product of the pendulum and the rotator perturbed with a small coupling between the two. This example was introduced by Arnold. Using a {\it separatrix map}, introduced in a low dimensional case by Zaslavskii-Filonenko and studied in a multidimensional case by Treschev and Piftankin, for an open class of trigonometric perturbations we prove that NHIL do exist. Moreover, using a second order expansion for the separatrix map from [GKZ], we prove that the system restricted to this NHIL is a skew product of nearly integrable cylinder maps. Application of the results from [CK] about random iteration of such skew products show that in the proper \varepsilon-dependent time scale the push forward of a Bernoulli measure supported on this NHIL weakly converges to an Ito diffusion process on the line as \varepsilon tends to zero.
