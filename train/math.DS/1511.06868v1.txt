Let A be an expanding endomorphism on the torus {\Bbb T}^d = {\Bbb R}^d /{\Bbb Z}^d with its smallest eigenvalue \lambda >1. Consider the ergodic system ({\Bbb T}^d, A, \mu) where \mu is Haar measure. We prove that the correlation \rho_{f, g}(n) of a pair of functions f, g \in L^2(\mu) is controlled by the modulus of L^2-continuity \Omega_{f, 2}(\lambda^{-n}) and that the estimate is to some extent optimal. We also prove the central limit theorem for the stationary process f(A^n x) defined by a function f satisfying \Sigma_n \Omega_{f,2}(\lambda^{-n}) <\infty. An application is given to the Ulam-von Neumann system.
