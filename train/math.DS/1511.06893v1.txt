Let \mu be a self-affine measure on \mathbb{R}^{d} associated to a self-affine IFS \{\varphi_{\lambda}(x) = A_{\lambda}x + v_{\lambda}\}_{\lambda\in\Lambda} and a probability vector p=(p_{\lambda})_{\lambda}>0. Assume the strong separation condition holds. Let \gamma_{1}\ge...\ge\gamma_{d} and D be the Lyapunov exponents and dimension corresponding to \{A_{\lambda}\}_{\lambda\in\Lambda} and p^{\mathbb{N}}, and let \mathbf{G} be the group generated by \{A_{\lambda}\}_{\lambda\in\Lambda}. We show that if \gamma_{m+1}>\gamma_{m}=...=\gamma_{d}, if \mathbf{G} acts irreducibly on the vector space of alternating m-forms, and if the Furstenberg measure \mu_{F} satisfies \dim_{H}\mu_{F}+D>(m+1)(d-m), then \mu is exact dimensional with \dim\mu=D.
