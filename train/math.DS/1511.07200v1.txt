We study a class of planar continuous piecewise linear vector fields with three zones. Using the Poincar\'e map and some techniques for proving the existence of limit cycles for smooth differential systems, we prove that this class admits at least two limit cycles that appear by perturbations of a period annulus. Moreover, we describe the bifurcation of the limit cycles for this class through two examples of two-parameter families of piecewise linear vector fields with three zones.
