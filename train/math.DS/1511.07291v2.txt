The dynamics of a 1-parameter family of cluster maps \varphi_r associated to mutation-periodic quivers in dimension 4, is studied in detail. The use of presymplectic reduction leads to a globally periodic symplectic map, and this enables us to reduce the problem to the study of maps belonging to a group of symplectic birational maps of the plane which is isomorphic to SL(2,\mathbb{Z})\ltimes\mathbb{R}^2. We conclude that there are three different types of dynamical behaviour for \varphi_r characterized by the integer parameter values r=1, r=2 and r>2. For each type, the periodic points, the structure and the asymptotic behaviour of the orbits are completely described. A finer description of the dynamics is provided by using first integrals.
