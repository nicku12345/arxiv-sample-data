The design of a nonlinear Luenberger observer for a parametrized linear SISO (single-input single-output) system is studied. From an observability assumption of the system, the existence of such an observer is concluded. In a second step, a novel algorithm for the identification of such systems is suggested and is implemented on a third order system. Compared to the adaptive observer available in the litterature, it has the advantage to be of low dimension and to admit a strict Lyapunov function. This is a long version of a paper which is published in IEEE TAC 2017.
