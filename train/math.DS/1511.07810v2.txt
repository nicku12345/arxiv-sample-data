In this article we characterize the complex hyperbolic groups that leave invariant a copy of the Veronese curve in \Bbb{P}^2_{\Bbb{C}}. As a corollary we get that every discrete compact surface group in \PO^+(2,1) admits a deformation in \PSL(3,\Bbb{C}) with a non-empty region of discontinuity which is not conjugate to a complex hyperbolic subgroup. This provides a way to construct new examples of Kleinian groups acting on \Bbb{P}^2_\Bbb{C}.
