We investigate the persistence of synchronization in networks of diffusively coupled oscillators when the coupling functions are nonidentical. Under mild conditions, we uncover the influence of the network interaction structure on the mismatches of the coupling function. We show that Erd\"os-R\'enyi random graphs support large perturbations in the coupling function. In contrast scale-free graphs do not allow large perturbations in the coupling function, that is, as the network size n goes to infinity it forces the coupling functions to be identical.
