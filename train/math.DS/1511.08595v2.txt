We show that binary Toeplitz flows can be interpreted as Delone dynamical systems induced by model sets and analyse the quantitative relations between the respective system parameters. This has a number of immediate consequences for the theory of model sets. In particular, we use our results in combination with special examples of irregular Toeplitz flows from the literature to demonstrate that irregular proper model sets may be uniquely ergodic and do not need to have positive entropy. This answers questions by Schlottmann and Moody.
