This paper presents a mechanism for the coexistence of hyperbolic and non-hyperbolic dynamics arising in a neighbourhood of a conservative Bykov cycle where trajectories turn in opposite directions near the two saddle-foci. We show that {within the class of divergence-free vector fields that preserve the cycle,} tangencies of the invariant manifolds of two hyperbolic saddle-foci densely occur. The global dynamics is persistently dominated by heteroclinic tangencies and by the existence of infinitely many elliptic points coexisting with suspended hyperbolic horseshoes. A generalized version of the Cocoon bifurcations for conservative systems is obtained.
