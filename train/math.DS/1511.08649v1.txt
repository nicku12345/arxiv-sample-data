We consider hyperbolic toral automorphisms which are reversible with respect to a linear area-preserving involution. We will prove that within this context reversibility is linked to a generalized Pell equation whose solutions we will analyze. Additionally, we will verify to what extent reversibility is a common feature and characterize the generic setting.
