Let f, g:S^1\to S^1 be two C^3 critical homeomorphisms of the circle with the same irrational rotation number and the same (finite) number of critical points, all of which are assumed to be non-flat, of power-law type. In this paper we prove that if h:S^1\to S^1 is a topological conjugacy between f and g and h maps the critical points of f to the critical points of g, then h is quasisymmetric. When the power-law exponents at all critical points are integers, this result is a special case of a general theorem recently proved by T.~Clark and S.~van Strien \cite{CS}. However, unlike the proof given in \cite{CS}, which relies on heavy complex-analytic machinery, our proof uses purely real-variable methods, and is valid for non-integer critical exponents as well. We do not require h to preserve the power-law exponents at corresponding critical points.
