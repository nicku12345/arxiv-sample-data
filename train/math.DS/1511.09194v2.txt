In this article we provide sufficient conditions on a self-similar interval exchange map, whose renormalization matrix has complex eigenvalues of modulus greater than one, for the existence of affine interval exchange maps with wandering intervals and semi-conjugate with it. These conditions are based on the algebraic properties of the complex eigenvalues and the complex fractals built from the natural substitution emerging from self-similarity. We show that the cubic Arnoux-Yoccoz interval exchange map satisfies these conditions.
