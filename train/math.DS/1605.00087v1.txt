We show that any two trajectories of solutions of a one-dimensional fractional differential equation (FDE) either coincide or do not intersect each other. In contrary, in the higher dimensional case, two different trajectories can meet. Furthermore, one-dimensional FDEs and triangular systems of FDEs generate nonlocal fractional dynamical systems, whereas a higher dimensional FDE does, in general, not generate a nonlocal dynamical system.
