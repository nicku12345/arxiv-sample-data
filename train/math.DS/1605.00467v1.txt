In this paper escape rates and local escape rates for special flows are sudied. In a general context the first result is that the escape rate depends monotonically on the ceiling function and fulfills certain scaling, invariance, and continuity properties. For the metric setting local escape rates are considered. If the base transformation is ergodic and exhibits an exponential convergence in probability of ergodic sums, then the local escape rate with respect to the flow is just the local escape rate with respect to the base transformation, divided by the integral of the ceiling function. Also a reformulation with respect to induced pressure is presented. Finally, under additional regularity conditions higher order asymptotics for the local escape rate are established.
