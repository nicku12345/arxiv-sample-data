We consider a piecewise linear two-dimensional dynamical system that couples a linear equation with the so-called stop operator. Global dynamics and bifurcations of this system are studied depending on two parameters. The system is motivated by modifications to general-equilibrium macroeconomic models that attempt to capture the frictions and memory-dependence of realistic economic agents.
