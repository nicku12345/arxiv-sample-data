Let M be a closed and connected manifold, H:T^*M\times \mathbb{R} / \mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{R} a Tonelli 1-periodic Hamiltonian and \mathcal{L} \subset T^*M a Lagrangian submanifold Hamiltonianly isotopic to the zero section. We prove that if \mathcal{L} is invariant by the time-one map of H, then \mathcal{L} is a graph over M. An interesting consequence in the autonomous case is that in this case, \mathcal{L} is invariant by all the time t maps of the Hamiltonian flow of H.
