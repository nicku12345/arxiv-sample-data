Let (X,T) be a topological dynamical system, and \mathcal{F} be a family of subsets of \mathbb{Z}_+. (X,T) is strongly \mathcal{F}-sensitive, if there is \delta>0 such that for each non-empty open subset U, there are x,y\in U with \{n\in\mathbb{Z}_+: d(T^nx,T^ny)>\delta\}\in\mathcal{F}. Let \mathcal{F}_t (resp. \mathcal{F}_{ip}, \mathcal{F}_{fip}) be consisting of thick sets (resp. IP-sets, subsets containing arbitrarily long finite IP-sets).   The following Auslander-Yorke's type dichotomy theorems are obtained: (1) a minimal system is either strongly \mathcal{F}_{fip}-sensitive or an almost one-to-one extension of its \infty-step nilfactor. (2) a minimal system is either strongly \mathcal{F}_{ip}-sensitive or an almost one-to-one extension of its maximal distal factor. (3) a minimal system is either strongly \mathcal{F}_{t}-sensitive or a proximal extension of its maximal distal factor.
