It is widely known that when X is compact Hausdorff, and when T: X \to X and f: X \to \mathbb{R} are continuous, \begin{equation*} P(T,f) = \sup_{\text{\mu: Radon probability}} \left( h_\mu(T) + \int f\, \mathrm{d}\mu \right), \end{equation*} where P(T,f) is the "topological pressure" and h_\mu(T) is the measure theoretic entropy of T with respect to \mu. This result is known as "variational principle". We generalize the concept of "topological pressure" for the case where X is a separable locally compact metric space. Our definitions are quite similar to those used in the compact case. Our main result is the validity of the "variational principle".
