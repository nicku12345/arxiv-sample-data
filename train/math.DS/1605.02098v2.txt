We exhibit a class of Schottky subgroups of \mathbf{PU}(1,n) (n \geq 2) which we call well-positioned and show that the Hausdorff dimension of the limit set \Lambda_\Gamma associated with such a subgroup \Gamma, with respect to the spherical metric on the boundary of complex hyperbolic n-space, is equal to the growth exponent \delta_\Gamma.   For general \Gamma we establish (under rather mild hypotheses) a lower bound involving the dimension of the Patterson-Sullivan measure along boundaries of complex geodesics.   Our main tool is a version of the celebrated Ledrappier-Young theorem.
