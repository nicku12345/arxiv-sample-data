Let \Gamma be some discrete subgroup of \mathbf{SO}^o(n+1,\mathbf{R}) with finite Bowen-Margulis-Sullivan measure. We study the dynamics of the Bowen-Margulis-Sullivan measure with respect to closed connected subspaces of the N component in some Iwasawa decomposition \mathbf{SO}^o(n+1,\mathbf{R})=KAN. We also study the dimension of projected Patterson-Sullivan measures along some fixed small circle.
