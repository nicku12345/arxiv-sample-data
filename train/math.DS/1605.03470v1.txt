Let -1<\lambda<1 and f:[0,1)\to\mathbb{R} be a piecewise \lambda-affine map, that is, there exist points 0=c_0<c_1<\cdots <c_{n-1}<c_n=1 and real numbers b_1,\ldots,b_n such that f(x)=\lambda x+b_i for every x\in [c_{i-1},c_i). We prove that, for Lebesgue almost every \delta\in\mathbb{R}, the map f_{\delta}=f+\delta\,({\rm mod}\,1) is asymptotically periodic. More precisely, f_{\delta} has at most 2n periodic orbits and the \omega-limit set of every x\in [0,1) is a periodic orbit.
