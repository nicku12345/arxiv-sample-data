The Tribonacci sequence \mathbb{T} is the fixed point of the substitution \sigma(a,b,c)=(ab,ac,a). In this note, we get the explicit expressions of all squares, and then establish the tree structure of the positions of repeated squares in \mathbb{T}, called square trees. Using the square trees, we give a fast algorithm for counting the number of repeated squares in \mathbb{T}[1,n] for all n, where \mathbb{T}[1,n] is the prefix of \mathbb{T} of length n. Moreover we get explicit expressions for some special n such as n=t_m (the Tribonacci number) etc.
