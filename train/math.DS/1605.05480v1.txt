In this paper we prove an infinite dimensional KAM theorem, in which the assumptions on the derivatives of perturbation in \cite{GT} are weakened from polynomial decay to logarithmic decay. As a consequence, we apply it to 1d quantum harmonic oscillators and prove the reducibility of a linear harmonic oscillator, T=- \frac{d^2}{dx^2}+x^2, on L^2(\R) perturbed by a quasi-periodic in time potential V(x,\omega t; \omega) with logarithmic decay. This entails the pure-point nature of the spectrum of the Floquet operator K, where K:=-{\rm i}\sum_{k=1}^n\omega_k\frac{\partial}{\partial \theta_k}- \frac{d^2}{dx^2}+x^2+\varepsilon V(x,\theta;\omega), is defined on L^2(\R) \otimes L^2(\T^n) and the potential V(x,\theta;\omega) has logarithmic decay as well as its gradient in \omega.
