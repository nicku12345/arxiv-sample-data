The transcritical bifurcation without parameters (TBWP) describes a stability change along a line of equilibria, resulting from the loss of normal hyperbolicity at a given point of such a line. Memristive circuits systematically yield manifolds of non-isolated equilibria, and in this paper we address a systematic characterization of the TBWP in circuits with a single memristor. To achieve this we develop two mathematical results of independent interest; the first one is an extension of the TBWP theorem to explicit ordinary differential equations (ODEs) in arbitrary dimension; the second result drives the characterization of this phenomenon to semiexplicit differential-algebraic equations (DAEs), which provide the appropriate framework for the analysis of circuit dynamics. In the circuit context the analysis is performed in graph-theoretic terms: in this setting, our first working scenario is restricted to passive problems (exception made of the bifurcating memristor), and in a second step some results are presented for the analysis of non-passive cases. The latter context is illustrated by means of a memristive neural network model.
