This paper proves that a set-valued dynamical system is sensitively dependent on initial conditions (resp., \mathscr{F}-sensitive, multi-sensitive) if and only if its g-fuzzification is sensitively dependent on initial conditions (resp., \mathscr{F}-sensitive, multi-sensitive), where \mathscr{F} is a Furstenberg family. As an application, it is shown that there exists a sensitive dynamical system whose g-fuzzification does not have such sensitive dependence for any g in a certain domain. Moreover, a sufficient condition ensuring that the g-fuzzification of every nontrivial dynamical system is not transitive is obtained. These give an answer to a question posed in \cite[J. Kupka, Information Sciences, {\bf 279} (2014): 642--653]{Kupka2014}.
