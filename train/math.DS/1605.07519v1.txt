In this paper we provide an elementary proof of the existence of canard solutions for a class of singularly perturbed predator-prey planar systems in which there occurs a transcritical bifurcation of quasi steady states. The proof uses a one-dimensional theory of canard solutions developed by V. F. Butuzov, N. N. Nefedov and K. R. Schneider, and an appropriate monotonicity assumption on the vector field to extend it to the two-dimensional case. The result is applied to identify all possible predator-prey models with quadratic vector fields allowing for the existence of canard solutions.
