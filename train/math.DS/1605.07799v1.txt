We present a methodology for computer assisted proofs of Shil'nikov homoclinic intersections. It is based on geometric bounds on the invariant manifolds using rate conditions, and on propagating the bounds by an interval arithmetic integrator. Our method ensures uniqueness of the parameter for which the homoclinic takes place. We apply the method for the Lorenz-84 atmospheric circulation model, obtaining a sharp bound for the parameter, and also for where the homoclinic intersection of the stable/unstable manifolds takes place.
