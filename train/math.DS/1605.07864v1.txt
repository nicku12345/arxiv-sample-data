We are concerned with the dynamics of N point vortices z_1,\dots,z_N\in\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^2 in a planar domain. This is described by a Hamiltonian system \[ \Gamma_k\dot{z}_k(t)=J\nabla_{z_k} H\big(z(t)\big),\quad k=1,\dots,N, \] where \Gamma_1,\dots,\Gamma_N\in\mathbb{R}\setminus\{0\} are the vorticities, J\in\mathbb{R}^{2\times2} is the standard symplectic 2\times2 matrix, and the Hamiltonian H is of N-vortex type: \[ H(z_1,\dots,z_N)   = -\frac1{2\pi}\sum_{j\ne k}^N \Gamma_j\Gamma_k\log|z_j-z_k| - \sum_{j,k=1}^N\Gamma_j\Gamma_kg(z_j,z_k). \] Here g:\Omega\times\Omega\to\mathbb{R} is an arbitrary symmetric function of class C^2, e.g.\ the regular part of a hydrodynamic Green function. Given a nondegenerate critical point a_0\in\Omega of h(z)=g(z,z) and a nondegenerate relative equilibrium Z(t)\in\mathbb{R}^{2N} of the Hamiltonian system in the plane with g=0, we prove the existence of a smooth path of periodic solutions z^{(r)}(t)=\big(z^{(r)}_1(t),\dots,z^{(r)}_N(t)\big)\in\Omega^N, 0<r<r_0, with z^{(r)}_k(t)\to a_0 as r\to0. In the limit r\to0, and after a suitable rescaling, the solutions look like Z(t).
