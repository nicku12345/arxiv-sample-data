We study the dynamics of planar diffeomorphisms having a unique fixed point that is a hyperbolic local saddle. We obtain sufficient conditions under which the fixed point is a global saddle. We also address the special case of D_2-symmetric maps, for which we obtain a similar result for C^1 homeomorphisms. Some applications to differential equations are also given.
