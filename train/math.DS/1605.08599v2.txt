Using a recent Furstenberg structure theorem, we obtain Multiple Recurrence Theorems relative to any locally compact second countable Noetherian module G over a syndetic ring R, which generalizes Furstenberg's multiple recurrence theorem. In addition we study the multiple Birkhoff center and the pointwise multiple recurrence of a topological G-action on a compact metric space.
