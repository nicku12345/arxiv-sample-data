In this work, we give a new proof of the classification of the Lotka-Volterra and Reversible foliations, originally given by Gautier. This new proof, involves an unified technique for both cases, using the theory of foliations.   In addition, we obtain a linear family of elliptical foliations with a non-invariant tangency set.
