Downarowicz and Maass (2008) have shown that every Cantor minimal homeomorphism with finite topological rank K > 1 is expansive. Bezuglyi, Kwiatkowski, and Medynets (2009) extended the result to non-minimal aperiodic cases. In this paper, we show that all finite-rank zero-dimensional systems are expansive or have infinite odometer systems; this is an extension of the two aforementioned results. Nevertheless, the methods follow similar approaches.
