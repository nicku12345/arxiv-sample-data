For a measurable map T and a sequence of T-invariant probability measures \mu_n that converges in some sense to a T-invariant probability measure \mu, an estimate from below for the Kolmogorov--Sinai entropy of T with respect to \mu is suggested in terms of the entropies of T with respect to \mu_1, \mu_2, \dots. This result is obtained under the assumption that some generating partition has finite entropy. By an explicite example it is shown that, in general, this assumption cannot be removed.
