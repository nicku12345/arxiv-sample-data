Many years ago B.S. Pitskel observed that the metric entropy of the shift transformation in the sample space of a stationary random process X=\{X_n,\,n\in \mathbb Z\} with a countable number of states is equal to the conditional entropy H(X_0|X_{-1},X_{-2},\dots) if X is a stationary Markov chain (in which case the above conditional entropy is H(X_0|X_{-1})), whether the entropy H(X_0) is finite or not, while in general the statement is not true. In this note we present a class of processes for which Pitskel's observation holds, despite the fact that no of these processes is a Markov chain of some order.
