An algorithm is presented for numerical computation of choreographies in spaces of constant negative curvature in a hyperbolic cotangent potential, extending the ideas given in a companion paper for computing choreographies in the plane in a Newtonian potential and on a sphere in a cotangent potential. Following an idea of Diacu, P\'{e}rez-Chavela and Reyes Victoria, we use stereographic projection and study the problem in the Poincar\'{e} disk. Using approximation by trigonometric polynomials and optimization methods with exact gradient and exact Hessian matrix, we find new choreographies, hyperbolic analogues of the ones presented in the companion paper. The algorithm proceeds in two phases: first BFGS quasi-Newton iteration to get close to a solution, then Newton iteration for high accuracy.
