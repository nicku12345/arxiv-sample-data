For a truncated stochastically perturbed equation x_{n+1}=\max\{ f(x_n)+l\chi_{n+1}, 0 \} with f(x)<x on (0,m), which corresponds to the Allee effect, we observe that for very small perturbation amplitude l, the eventual behavior is similar to a non-perturbed case: there is extinction for small initial values in (0,m-\varepsilon) and persistence for x_0 \in (m+\delta, H] for some H satisfying H>f(H)>m. As the amplitude grows, an interval (m-\varepsilon, m+\delta) of initial values arises and expands, such that with a certain probability, x_n sustains in [m, H], and possibly eventually gets into the interval (0,m-\varepsilon), with a positive probability. Lower estimates for these probabilities are presented. If H is large enough, as the amplitude of perturbations grows, the Allee effect disappears: a solution persists for any positive initial value.
