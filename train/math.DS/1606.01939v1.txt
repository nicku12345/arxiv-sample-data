We consider the influence of stochastic perturbations on stability of a unique positive equilibrium of a difference equation subject to prediction-based control. These perturbations may be multiplicative x_{n+1}=f(x_n)-\left( \alpha + l\xi_{n+1} \right) (f(x_n)-x_n), \quad n=0, 1, \dots if they arise from stochastic variation of the control parameter, or additive x_{n+1}=f(x_n)-\alpha(f(x_n)-x_n) +l\xi_{n+1}, \quad n=0, 1, \dots  if they reflect the presence of systemic noise.   We begin by relaxing the control parameter in the deterministic equation, and deriving a range of values for the parameter over which all solutions eventually enter an invariant interval. Then, by allowing the variation to be stochastic, we derive sufficient conditions (less restrictive than known ones for the unperturbed equation) under which the positive equilibrium will be globally a.s. asymptotically stable:i.e. the presence of noise improves the known effectiveness of prediction-based control. Finally, we show that systemic noise has a "blurring" effect on the positive equilibrium, which can be made arbitrarily small by controlling the noise intensity. Numerical examples illustrate our results.
