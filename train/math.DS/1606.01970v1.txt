Given a deterministic difference equation x_{n+1}= f(x_n), we would like to stabilize any point x^{\ast}\in (0, f(b)), where b is a unique maximum point of f, by introducing proportional feedback (PF) control. We assume that PF control contains either a multiplicative x_{n+1}= f\left( (\nu + \ell\chi_{n+1})x_n \right) or an additive noise x_{n+1}=f(\lambda x_n) +\ell\chi_{n+1}. We study conditions under which the solution eventually enters some interval, treated as a stochastic (blurred) equilibrium. In addition, we prove that, for each \varepsilon>0, when the noise level \ell is sufficiently small, all solutions eventually belong to the interval (x^{\ast}-\varepsilon,x^{\ast}+\varepsilon).
