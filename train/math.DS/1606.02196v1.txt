We discuss the structure of radial solutions of some superlinear elliptic equations which model diffusion phenomena when both absorption and production are present. We focus our attention on solutions defined in R (regular) or in R \ {0} (singular) which are infinitesimal at infinity, discussing also their asymptotic behavior. The phenomena we find are present only if absorption and production coexist, i.e., if the reaction term changes sign. Our results are then generalized to include the case where Hardy potentials are considered.
