For a cocycle of invertible real n-by-n matrices, the Multiplicative Ergodic Theorem gives an Oseledets subspace decomposition of \mathbb{R}^n; that is, above each point in the base space, \mathbb{R}^n is written as a direct sum of equivariant subspaces, one for each Lyapunov exponent of the cocycle. It is natural to ask if these summands may be further decomposed into equivariant subspaces; that is, if the Oseledets subspaces are reducible. We prove a theorem yielding sufficient conditions for irreducibility of the trivial equivariant subspaces \mathbb{R}^2 and \mathbb{C}^2 for O_2(\mathbb{R})-valued cocycles and give explicit examples where the conditions are satisfied.
