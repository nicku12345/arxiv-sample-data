For a nonlinear equation with several variable delays  \dot{x}(t)=\sum_{k=1}^m f_k(t, x(h_1(t)),\dots,x(h_l(t)))-g(t,x(t)),  where the functions f_k increase in some variables and decrease in the others, we obtain conditions when a positive solution exists on [0, \infty), as well as explore boundedness and persistence of solutions. Finally, we present sufficient conditions when a solution is unbounded. Examples include the Mackey-Glass equation with non-monotone feedback and two variable delays; its solutions can be neither persistent nor bounded, unlike the well studied case when these two delays coincide.
