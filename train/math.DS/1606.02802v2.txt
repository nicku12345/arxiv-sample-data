We consider difference equations with several non-monotone deviating arguments and nonnegative coefficients. The deviations (delays and advances) are, generally, unbounded. Sufficient oscillation conditions are obtained in an explicit iterative form. Additional results in terms of \liminf  are obtained for bounded deviations. Examples illustrating the oscillation tests are presented.
