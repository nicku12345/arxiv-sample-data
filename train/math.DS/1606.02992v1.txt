For a physical or biological model whose dynamics is described by a higher order difference equation u_{n+1}=f(u_n,u_{n-1}, \dots, u_{n-k+1}), we propose a version of a target oriented control u_{n+1}=cT+(1-c)f(u_n,u_{n-1}, \dots, u_{n-k+1}), with T\ge 0, c\in [0,1). In ecological systems, the method incorporates harvesting and recruitment and for a wide class of f, allows to stabilize (locally or globally) a fixed point of f. If a point which is not a fixed point of f has to be stabilized, the target oriented control is an appropriate method for achieving this goal. As a particular case, we consider pest control applied to pest populations with delayed density-dependence. This corresponds to a proportional feedback method, which includes harvesting only, for higher order equations.
