For a wide class of second order nonlinear non-autonomous models, we illustrate that combining proportional state control with the feedback that is proportional to the derivative of the chaotic signal, allows to stabilize unstable motions of the system. The delays are variable, which leads to more flexible controls permitting delay perturbations; only delay bounds are significant for stabilization by a delayed control. The results are applied to the sunflower equation which has an infinite number of equilibrium points.
