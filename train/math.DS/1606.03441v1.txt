We prove some results on the behavior of infinite sums of the form \Sigma f\circ T^n(x)\frac{1}{n}, where T:S^1\to S^1 is an irrational circle rotation and f is a mean-zero function on S^1. In particular, we show that for a certain class of functions f, there are Liouville \alpha for which this sum diverges everywhere. We also show that there are Liouville \alpha for which the sum converges everywhere.
