The quantization scheme in probability theory deals with finding a best approximation of a given probability distribution by a probability distribution that is supported on finitely many points. Let P be a Borel probability measure on \mathbb R such that P=\frac 12 P\circ S_1^{-1}+\frac 12 P\circ S_2^{-1}, where S_1 and S_2 are two contractive similarity mappings given by S_1(x)=rx and S_2(x)=rx+1-r for 0<r<\frac 12 and x\in \mathbb R. Then, P is supported on the Cantor set generated by S_1 and S_2. The case r=\frac 13 was treated by Graf and Luschgy who gave an exact formula for the unique optimal quantization of the Cantor distribution P (Math. Nachr., 183 (1997), 113-133). In this paper, we compute the precise range of r-values to which Graf-Luschgy formula extends.
