We study the Schr\"odinger equation on \R with a polynomial potential behaving as x^{2l} at infinity, 1\leq l\in\N and with a small time quasiperiodic perturbation. We prove that if the symbol of the perturbation grows at most like (\xi^2+x^{2l})^{\beta/(2l)}, with \beta<l+1, then the system is reducible. Some extensions including cases with \beta=2l are also proved. The result implies boundedness of Sobolev norms. The proof is based on pseudodifferential calculus and KAM theory.
