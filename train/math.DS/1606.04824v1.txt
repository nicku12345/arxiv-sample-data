A non-autonomous version of the standard map with a periodic variation of the parameter is introduced and studied. Symmetry properties in the variables and parameters of the map are found and used to find relations between rotation numbers of invariant sets of the autonomous realization of the period-two case of the map. The role of the nonautonomous dynamics on period-one orbits, stability and bifurcation is studied. The critical boundaries for the global transport and the destruction of invariant circles with fixed rotation number are studied in detail using direct computation and a continuation method. In the case of global transport, the critical boundary has a particular symmetrical horn shape. The results are contrasted with similar calculations found in the literature.
