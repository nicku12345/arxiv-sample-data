In this paper we consider continued fraction (CF) expansions on intervals different from [0,1]. For every x in such interval we find a CF expansion with a finite number of possible digits. Using the natural extension, the density of the invariant measure is obtained in a number of examples. In case this method does not work, a Gauss-Kuzmin-L\'evy based approximation method is used. Finally, a subfamily of the N-expansions is studied. In particular, the entropy as a function of a parameter \alpha is estimated for N=2 and N=36. Interesting behavior can be observed from numerical results.
