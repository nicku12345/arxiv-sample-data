We consider the infinite one-sided sequence generated by the period-doubling substitution \sigma(a,b)=(ab,aa), denoted by \mathbb{D}. Since \mathbb{D} is uniformly recurrent, each factor \omega appears infinite many times in the sequence, which is arranged as \omega_p (p\ge 1). Let r_p(\omega) be the p-th return word over \omega. The main result is: for each factor \omega, the sequence \{r_p(\omega)\}_{p\geq1} is \Theta_1 or \Theta_2, which are substitutive sequences and determined completely in this paper.
