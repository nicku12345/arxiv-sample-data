In this article, we study the dynamics of the following family of rational maps with one parameter: \begin{equation*} f_\lambda(z)= z^n+\frac{\lambda^2}{z^n-\lambda}, \end{equation*} where n\geq 3 and \lambda\in\mathbb{C}^*. This family of rational maps can be viewed as a singular perturbations of the simple polynomial P_n(z)=z^n. We give a characterization of the topological properties of the Julia sets of the family f_\lambda according to the dynamical behaviors of the orbits of the free critical points.
