We relate the local specification and periodic shadowing properties. We also clarify the relation between local weak specification and local specification if the system is measure expansive. The notion of strong measure expansiveness is introduced, and an example of a non-expansive systems with the strong measure expansive property is given. Moreover, we find a family of examples with the N-expansive property, which are not strong measure expansive. We finally show a spectral decomposition theorem for strong measure expansive dynamical systems with shadowing.
