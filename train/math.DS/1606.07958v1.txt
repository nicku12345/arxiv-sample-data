In this manuscript we define the right fractional derivative and its corresponding right fractional integral with exponential kernel. Then, we provide the integration by parts formula and we use Q-operator to confirm our results. The related Euler-Lagrange equations were obtained and one example is analyzed. Moreover, we formulate and discus the discrete counterparts of our results.
