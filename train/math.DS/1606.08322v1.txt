On a real (\mathbb F=\mathbb R) or complex (\mathbb F=\mathbb C) analytic connected 2-manifold M with empty boundary consider two vector fields X,Y. We say that Y {\it tracks} X if [Y,X]=fX for some continuous function f\colon M\rightarrow\mathbb F. Let K be a compact subset of the zero set {\mathsf Z}(X) such that {\mathsf   Z}(X)-K is closed, with nonzero Poincar\'e-Hopf index (for example K={\mathsf Z}(X) when M is compact and \chi(M)\neq 0) and let \mathcal G be a finite-dimensional Lie algebra of analytic vector fields on M. \smallskip   {\bf Theorem.} Let X be analytic and nontrivial. If every element of \mathcal G tracks X and, in the complex case when {\mathsf i}_K (X) is positive and even no quotient of \mathcal G is isomorphic to {\mathfrak {s}}{\mathfrak {l}} (2,\mathbb C), then \mathcal G has some zero in K. \smallskip   {\bf Corollary.} If Y tracks a nontrivial vector field X, both of them analytic, then Y vanishes somewhere in K. \smallskip   Besides fixed point theorems for certain types of transformation groups are proved. Several illustrative examples are given.
