We disprove the conjecture that distributional chaos of type 3 (briefly, DC3) is iteration invariant and show that a slightly strengthened definition, denoted by DC2\frac{1}{2}, is preserved under iteration, i.e. f^n is DC2\frac{1}{2} if and only if f is too. Unlike DC3, DC2\frac{1}{2} is also conjugacy invariant and implies Li-Yorke chaos. The definition of DC2\frac{1}{2} is the following: a pair (x,y) is DC2\frac{1}{2} iff \Phi_{(x,y)}(0)<\Phi^*_{(x,y)}(0), where \Phi_{(x,y)}(\delta) (resp. \Phi^*_{(x,y)}(\delta)) is lower (resp. upper) density of times k when d(f^k(x),f^k(y))<\delta and both densities are defined at 0 as limits of their values for \delta\to 0^+. Hence DC2\frac{1}{2} shares similar properties with DC1 and DC2 but unlike them, strict DC2\frac{1}{2} systems must have zero topological entropy.
