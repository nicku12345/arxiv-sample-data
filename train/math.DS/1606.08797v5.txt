Consider the action of SL(n+1,\mathbb{R}) on \mathbb{S}^n arising as the quotient of the linear action on \mathbb{R}^{n+1}\setminus\{0\}. We show that for a semigroup \mathfrak{S} of SL(n+1,\mathbb{R}), the following are equivalent: (1) \mathfrak{S} acts distally on the unit sphere \mathbb{S}^n. (2) the closure of \mathfrak{S} is a compact group. We also show that if \mathfrak{S} is closed, the above conditions are equivalent to the condition that every cyclic subsemigroup of \mathfrak{S} acts distally on \mathbb{S}^n. On the unit circle \mathbb{S}^1, we consider the `affine' actions corresponding to maps in GL(2,\mathbb{R}) and discuss the conditions for the existence of fixed points and periodic points, which in turn imply that these maps are not distal.
