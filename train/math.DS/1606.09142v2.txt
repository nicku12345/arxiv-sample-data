For flows whose return map on a cross section has sufficient mixing property, we show that the hitting time distribution of the flow to balls is exponential in limit. We also establish a link between the extreme value distribution of the flow and its hitting time distribution, generalizing a previous work by Freitas et al. in the discrete time case. Finally we show that for maps that can be modeled by Young`s tower with polynomial tail, the extreme value law holds.
