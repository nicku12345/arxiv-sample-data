The polynomial automorphisms of the affine plane have been studied a lot: if f is such an automorphism, then either f preserves a rational fibration, has an uncountable centralizer and its first dynamical degree equals 1, or f preserves no rational curves, has a countable centralizer and its first dynamical degree is >1. In higher dimensions there is no such description. In this article we study a family (\Psi_\alpha)_\alpha of polynomial automorphisms of \mathbb{C}^3. We show that the first dynamical degree of \Psi_\alpha is >1, that \Psi_\alpha preserves a unique rational fibration and has an uncountable centralizer. We then describe the dynamics of the family (\Psi_\alpha)_\alpha, in particular the speed of points escaping to infinity. We also observe different behaviors according to the value of the parameter \alpha.
