We show that every effectively closed action of a finitely generated group G on a closed subset of \{0,1\}^{\mathbb{N}} can be obtained as a topological factor of the G-subaction of a (G \times H_1 \times H_2)-subshift of finite type (SFT) for any choice of infinite and finitely generated groups H_1,H_2. As a consequence, we obtain that every group of the form G_1 \times G_2 \times G_3 admits a non-empty strongly aperiodic SFT subject to the condition that each G_i is finitely generated and has decidable word problem. As a corollary of this last result we prove the existence of non-empty strongly aperiodic SFT in a large class of branch groups, notably including the Grigorchuk group.
