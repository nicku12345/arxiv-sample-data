A state feedback controller design is proposed to guarantee stability of a nonuniformly sampled system for arbitrary selections of sampling periods within an interval, assuming the controller can select the sampling period. It is also shown that such an interval always exists when the continuous time system - that is to be sampled nonuniformly - is stabilizable. The proposed method uses singular value assignment to guarantee the stability. Also, special selections for desired singular values are provided to demonstrate that this method can also be used to improve the performance at the expense of the maximum sampling period.
