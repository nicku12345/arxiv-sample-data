Given a homogeneous space X = G/\Gamma with G containing the group H = (\mathrm{SO}(n,1))^k. Let x\in X such that Hx is dense in X. Given an analytic curve \phi: I=[a,b] \rightarrow H, we will show that if \phi satisfies certain geometric condition, then for a typical diagonal subgroup A =\{a(t): t \in \mathbb{R}\} \subset H the translates \{a(t)\phi(I)x: t >0\} of the curve \phi(I)x will tend to be equidistributed in X as t \rightarrow +\infty. The proof is based on the study of linear representations of \mathrm{SO}(n,1) and H.
