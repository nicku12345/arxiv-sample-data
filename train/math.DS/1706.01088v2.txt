We answer the two questions left open in [Z.~Ko\v{c}an, Internat. J. Bifur. Chaos Appl. Sci. Engrg. \textbf{22}, article id: 125025 (2012)] i.e. whether there is a relation between \omega-chaos and distributional chaos and whether there is a relation between an infinite LY-scrambled set and distributional chaos for dendrite maps. We construct a continuous self-map of dendrite without any \textit{DC3} pairs but containing an uncountable \omega-scrambled set. To answer for the second question we construct dendrite \mathcal{D} and continuous dendrite map without an infinite LY-scrambled set but with \textit{DC1} pairs.
