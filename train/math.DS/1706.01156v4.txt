In this work we deal with partially hyperbolic diffeomorphisms whose central direction is two dimensional. We prove that in general the accessibility classes are immersed manifolds. If, furthermore, the diffeomorphism is dynamically coherent and satisfies certain bunching condition, then the accessibility classes are C^{1} immersed manifolds.
