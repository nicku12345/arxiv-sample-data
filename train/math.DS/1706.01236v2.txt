We consider a discrete time competition model. Populations compete for common limited resources but they have different fertilities and mortalities rates. We compare dynamical properties of this model with its continuous counterpart. We give sufficient conditions for competitive exclusion and the existence of periodic solutions related to the classical logistic, Beverton-Holt and Ricker models.
