In the present paper, by conducting research on the dynamics of the p-adic generalized Ising mapping corresponding to renormalization group associated with the p-adic Ising-Vannemenus model on a Cayley tree, we have determined the existence of the fixed points of a given function. Simultaneously, the attractors of the dynamical system have been found. We have come to a conclusion that the considered mapping is topologically conjugate to the symbolic shift which implies its chaoticity and as an application, we have established the existence of periodic p-adic Gibbs measures for the p-adic Ising-Vannemenus model.
