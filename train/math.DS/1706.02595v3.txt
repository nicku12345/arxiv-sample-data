A trajectory u_n := F^n(u_0), n = 0,1,2, \dots  is quasiperiodic if the trajectory lies on and is dense in some d-dimensional torus, and there is a choice of coordinates on the torus \mathbb{T} for which F has the form F(\theta) = \theta + \rho\bmod1 for all \theta\in\mathbb{T} and for some \rho\in\mathbb{T}. There is an ancient literature on computing three rotation rates \rho for the Moon. %There is a literature on determining the coordinates of the vector \rho, called the rotation rates of F. (For d>1 we always interpret \bmod1 as being applied to each coordinate.) However, even in the case d=1 there has been no general method for computing \rho given only the trajectory u_n, though there is a literature dealing with special cases. Here we present our Embedding Continuation Method for computing some components of \rho from a trajectory. It is based on the Takens Embedding Theorem and the Birkhoff Ergodic Theorem. Rotation rates are often called "rotation numbers" and both refer to a rate of rotation of a circle. However, the coordinates of \rho depend on the choice of coordinates of \mathbb{T}. We explore the various sets of possible rotation rates that \rho can yield. We illustrate our ideas with examples in dimensions d=1 and 2.
