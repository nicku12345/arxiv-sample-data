Let f be an orientation preserving homeomorphisms on the circle with several break points, that is, its derivative Df has jump discontinuities at these points. We study Rauzy-Veech renormalizations of piecewise smooth circle homeomorphisms, by considering such maps as generalized interval exchange maps with genus one. Suppose that Df is absolutely continuous on the each interval of continuity and D\ln{Df}\in \mathbb{L}_{p} for some p>1. We prove that, under certain combinatorial assumptions on f, renormalizations R^{n}(f) are approximated by piecewise M\"{o}bus functions in C^{1+L_{1}}-norm, that means, R^{n}(f) are approximated in C^{1}-norm and D^{2}R^{n}(f) are approximated in L_{1}-norm. In particular, if f has trivial product of size of breaks, then the renormalizations are approximated by piecewise affine interval exchange maps.
