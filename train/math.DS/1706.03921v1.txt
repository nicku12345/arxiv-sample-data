In this paper we consider a class of nonlinear wave equation with x-dependent coefficients and prove existence of families of time-periodic solutions under the general boundary conditions. Such a model arises from the forced vibrations of a nonhomogeneous string and the propagation of seismic waves in nonisotropic media. The proofs are based on a Lyapunov-Schmidt reduction together with a differentiable Nash-Moser iteration scheme.
