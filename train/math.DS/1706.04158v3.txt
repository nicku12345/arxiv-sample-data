We study random towers that are suitable to analyse the statistics of slowly mixing random systems. We obtain upper bounds on the rate of quenched correlation decay in a general setting. We apply our results to the random family of Liverani-Saussol-Vaienti maps with parameters in [\alpha_0,\alpha_1]\subset (0,1) chosen independently with respect to a distribution \nu on [\alpha_0,\alpha_1] and show that the quenched decay of correlation is governed by the fastest mixing map in the family. In particular, we prove that for every \delta >0, for almost every \omega \in [\alpha_0,\alpha_1]^\mathbb Z, the upper bound n^{1-\frac{1}{\alpha_0}+\delta} holds on the rate of decay of correlation for H\"older observables on the fibre over \omega. For three different distributions \nu on [\alpha_0,\alpha_1] (discrete, uniform, quadratic), we also derive sharp asymptotics on the measure of return-time intervals for the quenched dynamics, ranging from n^{-\frac{1}{\alpha_0}} to (\log n)^{\frac{1}{\alpha_0}}\cdot n^{-\frac{1}{\alpha_0}} to (\log n)^{\frac{2}{\alpha_0}}\cdot n^{-\frac{1}{\alpha_0}} respectively.
