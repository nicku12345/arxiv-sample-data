The goal of this work is to study the existence of quasi-periodic solutions in time to nonlinear beam equations with a multiplicative potential. The nonlinearities are required to only finitely differentiable and the frequency is along a pre-assigned direction. The result holds on any compact Lie group or homogenous manifold with respect to a compact Lie group, which includes the standard torus \mathbf{T}^{d}, the special orthogonal group SO(d), the special unitary group SU(d), the spheres S^d and the real and complex Grassmannians. The proof is based on a differentiable Nash-Moser iteration scheme.
