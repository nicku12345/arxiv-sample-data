We classify the Rauzy-Veech groups of all connected components of all strata of the moduli space of translation surfaces in absolute homology, showing, in particular, that they are commensurable to arithmetic lattices of symplectic groups. As a corollary, we prove a conjecture of Zorich about the Zariski-density of such groups.
