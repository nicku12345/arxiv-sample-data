In this paper, we consider the reducibility of the quasi-periodic linear Hamiltonian system \dot{x}=(A+\varepsilon Q(t))x,  where A is a constant matrix with possible multiple eigenvalues, Q(t) is analytic quasi-periodic with respect to t, and \varepsilon is a sufficiently small parameter. Under some non-resonant conditions, it is proved that, for most sufficiently small \varepsilon, the Hamiltonian system can be reduced to a constant coefficient Hamiltonian system by means of a quasi-periodic symplectic change of variables with the same basic frequencies as Q(t). Application to quasi-periodic Hill's equation is also given.
