In this paper we are concerned with the existence of invariant tori in nearly integrable Hamiltonian systems \begin{equation*} H=h(y)+f(x,y,t), \end{equation*} where y\in D\subseteq\mathbb{R}^n with D being a closed bounded domain, x\in \mathbb{T}^n, f(x,y,t) is a real analytic almost periodic function in t with the frequency {{\omega}}=(\cdots,{{\omega}}_\lambda,\cdots)_{\lambda\in \mathbb{Z}}\in \mathbb{R}^{\mathbb{Z}}. As an application, we will prove the existence of almost periodic solutions and the boundedness of all solutions for the second order differential equations with superquadratic potentials depending almost periodically on time.
