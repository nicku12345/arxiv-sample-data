In this paper, we are concerned with the impulsive Duffing equation  x''+x^{2n+1}+\sum_{i=0}^{2n}x^{i}p_{i}(t)=0,\ t\neq t_{j},  with impulsive effects x(t_{j}+)=x(t_{j}-),\ x'(t_{j}+)=-x'(t_{j}-),\ j=\pm1,\pm2,\cdots, where the time dependent coefficients p_i(t)\in C^1(\mathbb{S}^1)\ (n+1\leq i\leq 2n) and p_i(t)\in C^0(\mathbb{S}^1)\ (0\leq i\leq n) with \mathbb{S}^1=\mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}. If impulsive times are 1-periodic and t_{2}-t_{1}\neq\frac{1}{2} for 0< t_{1}<t_{2}<1, basing on a so-called large twist theorem recently established by X. Li, B. Liu and Y. Sun in \cite{XLi}, we find large invariant curves diffeomorphism to circles surrounding the origin and going to infinity, which confines the solutions in its interior and therefore leads to the boundedness of these solutions. Meanwhile, it turns out that the solutions starting at t=0 on the invariant curves are quasiperiodic.
