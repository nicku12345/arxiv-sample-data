Let \mu be a Borel probability measure on \mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb R) with a finite exponential moment, and assume that the subgroup \Gamma_{\mu} generated by the support of \mu is Zariski dense. Let \nu be the unique \mu-stationary measure on \mathbb P^1_{\mathbb R}. We prove that the Fourier coefficients \widehat{\nu}(k) of \nu converge to 0 as |k| tends to infinity. Our proof relies on a generalized renewal theorem for the Cartan projection.
