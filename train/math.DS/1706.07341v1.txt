We study the regularization of an oriented 1-foliation \mathcal{F} on M \setminus \Sigma where M is a smooth manifold and \Sigma \subset M is a closed subset, which can be interpreted as the discontinuity locus of \mathcal{F}. In the spirit of Filippov's work, we define a sliding and sewing dynamics on the discontinuity locus \Sigma as some sort of limit of the dynamics of a nearby smooth 1-foliation and obtain conditions to identify whether a point belongs to the sliding or sewing regions.
