We consider piecewise smooth vector fields (PSVF) defined in open sets M\subseteq R^n with switching manifold being a smooth surface \Sigma. The PSVF are given by pairs X = (X_+, X_-), with X = X_+ in \Sigma_+ and X = X_- in \Sigma_- where \Sigma _+ and \Sigma _- are the regions on M separated by \Sigma. A regularization of X is a 1-parameter family of smooth vector fields X^{\epsilon},\epsilon>0, satisfying that X^{\epsilon} converges pointwise to X on M\setminus\Sigma, when \epsilon\rightarrow 0. Inspired by the Fenichel Theory , the sliding and sewing dynamics on the discontinuity locus \Sigma can be defined as some sort of limit of the dynamics of a nearby smooth regularization X^{\epsilon}. While the linear regularization requires that for every \epsilon>0 the regularized field X^{\epsilon} is in the convex combination of X_+  and X_-  the nonlinear regularization requires only that X^{\epsilon} is in a continuous combination of X_+  and X_- . We prove that for both cases, the sliding dynamics on \Sigma is determined by the reduced dynamics on the critical manifold of a singular perturbation problem. \end{abstract}
