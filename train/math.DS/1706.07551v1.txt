We generalize notions of passivity and dissipativity to fractional order systems. Similar to integer order systems, we show that the proposed definitions generate analogous stability and compositionality properties for fractional order systems as well. We also study the problem of passivating a fractional order system through a feedback controller. Numerical examples are presented to illustrate the concepts.
