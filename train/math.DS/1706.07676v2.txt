The MSS-sequences (U-sequences) in a wide class of unimodal maps have the look \mathrm{P}=(\mathrm{R} \mathrm{L}^{q})^{n_1} \mathrm{S}_1(m_1,q-1) (\mathrm{R} \mathrm{L}^{q})^{n_2}\mathrm{S}_2(m_2,q-1)  \ldots  (\mathrm{R} \mathrm{L}^{q})^{n_r}  \mathrm{S}_r(m_r,q-1)\mathrm{C}, where \mathrm{S}_i(m_i, q-1) are sequences of \mathrm{R}s and \mathrm{L}s that contain at most q-1 consecutive \mathrm{L}s. The first block \mathrm{RL}^q and the sequence \mathrm{S}_1 following it are essential for an admissible sequence to be a MSS-sequence. Moreover \mathrm{S}_i(m_i,q-1), \ i=2, \ldots, r are determined by \mathrm{S}_1(m_1,q-1). Explicit structure of MSS-sequences will be given as well as the theorems that decompose the non-primary MSS-sequences. The cardinality will be calculated for some important sets of non-primary MSS-sequences and an algorithm to generate the blocks \mathrm{S}_i(m_i,q-1), \ i=1, \ldots, r will be provided, as the construction of the blocks \mathrm{S}_i(m_i,q-1) allows the construction of the MSS-sequences.
