In this article we characterize monotone extensions of cw-expansive homeomorphisms of compact metric spaces. We study the topology of its quotient space in the case of a compact surface. These results are applied to prove that there are cw-expansive homeomorphisms of compact surfaces with infinitely many fixed points and empty wandering set. The examples are quotients of topological perturbations of pseudo-Anosov diffeomorphisms. We also show that there is a cw-expansive homeomorphism with the shadowing property of the 2-sphere.
