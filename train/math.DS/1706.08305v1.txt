We consider the topological relation behind the spectral behavior of a linear operator that arises in the stability problem of traveling waves on a large bounded domain. When the domain size tends to infinity, the absolute and asymptotic essential spectra appears as accumulation sets of eigenvalues under separated and periodic boundary conditions, respectively. We present new proofs of Sandstede and Scheel [Theorems 4 and 5 of [14]] in a topological framework. The eigenfunction induces a curve on the Grassmannian manifold. To extract topological information from them, we decompose the Grassmannian into the submanifolds using the Schubert cycles, and analyze the curves on each submanifolds.
