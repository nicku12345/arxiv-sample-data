We show that if the base frequency is Diophantine, then the Lyapunov exponent of a C^{k} quasi-periodic SL(2,\mathbb{R}) cocycle is 1/2-H\"older continuous in the almost reducible regime, if k is large enough. As a consequence, we show that if the frequency is Diophantine, k is large enough, and the potential is C^k small, then the integrated density of states of the corresponding quasi-periodic Schr\"odinger operator is 1/2-H\"older continuous.
