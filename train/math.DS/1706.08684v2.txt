We prove that the set of diffeomorphisms having at most finitely many attractors contains a dense and open subset of the space of C^1 partially hyperbolic diffeomorphisms with one-dimensional center.   This is obtained thanks to a robust geometric property of partially hyperbolic laminations that we show to hold after perturbations of the dynamics. This technique also allows to prove that C^1-generic diffeomorphisms far from homoclinic tangencies in dimension 3 either have at most finitely many attractors, or satisfy Newhouse phenomenon.
