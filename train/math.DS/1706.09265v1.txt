Motivation to revisit the Conley index theory for discrete multivalued dynamical systems stems from the needs of broader real applications, in particular in sampled dynamics or in combinatorial dynamics. The new construction of the index in [B. Batko and M. Mrozek, {\em SIAM J. Applied Dynamical Systems}, 15(2016), pp. 1143-1162] based on weak index pairs, under the circumstances of the absence of index pairs caused by relaxing the isolation property, seems to be a promising step towards this direction. The present paper is a direct continuation of [B. Batko and M. Mrozek, {\em SIAM J. Applied Dynamical Systems}, 15(2016), pp. 1143-1162] and concerns properties of the index defined therin, namely Wa\.zewski property, the additivity property, the homotopy (continuation) property and the commutativity property. We also present the construction of weak index pairs in an isolating block.
