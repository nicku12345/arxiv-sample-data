On a closed manifold M, we consider a smooth vector field X that generates an Anosov flow. Let V\in C^{\infty}\left(M;\mathbb{R}\right) be a smooth potential function. It is known that for any C>0, there exists some anisotropic Sobolev space \mathcal{H}_{C} such that the operator A=-X+V has intrinsic discrete spectrum on \mathrm{Re}\left(z\right)>-C called Ruelle-Pollicott resonances. In this paper, we show that the density of resonances is bounded by O\left(\left\langle \omega\right\rangle ^{\frac{n}{1+\beta_{0}}}\right) where \omega=\mathrm{Im}\left(z\right), n=\mathrm{dim}M-1 and 0<\beta_{0}\leq1 is the H\"older exponent of the distribution E_{u}\oplus E_{s} (strong stable and unstable). We also obtain some more precise results concerning the wave front set of the resonances states and the group property of the transfer operator. We use some semiclassical analysis based on wave packet transform associated to an adapted metric on T^{*}M and construct some specific anisotropic Sobolev spaces.
