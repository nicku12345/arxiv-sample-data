We introduce a new version of expansiveness for flows. Let M be a compact Riemannian manifold without boundary and X be a C^1 vector field on M that generates a flow \varphi_t on M. We call X {\it rescaling expansive} on a compact invariant set \Lambda of X if for any \epsilon>0 there is \delta>0 such that, for any x,y\in \Lambda and any time reparametrization \theta:\mathbb{R}\to \mathbb{R}, if d(\varphi_t(x), \varphi_{\theta(t)}(y)\le \delta\|X(\varphi_t(x))\| for all t\in \mathbb R, then \varphi_{\theta(t)}(y)\in \varphi_{[-\epsilon, \epsilon]}(\varphi_t(x)) for all t\in \mathbb R. We prove that every multisingular hyperbolic set (singular hyperbolic set in particular) is rescaling expansive and a converse holds generically.
