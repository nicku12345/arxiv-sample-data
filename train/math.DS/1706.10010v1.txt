The ring of polynomial over a finite field F_q[x] has received much attention, both from a combinatorial viewpoint as in regards to its action on measurable dynamical systems. In the case of (\mathbb{Z},+) we know that the ideal generated by any nonzero element is an IP^*-set. In the present article we first establish that the analogous result is true for F_q[x]. We further use this result to establish some mixing properties of the action of (F_q[x],+). We shall also discuss on Khintchine's recurrence for the action of (F_q[x]\setminus\{0\},\cdot).
