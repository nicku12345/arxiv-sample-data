This continues the investigation of a combinatorial model for the variation of dynamics in the family of rational maps of degree two, by concentrating on those varieties in which one critical point is periodic. We prove some general results about nonrational critically finite degree two branched coverings, and finally identify the boundary of the rational maps in the combinatorial model, thus completing the proofs of results announced in Part 1.
