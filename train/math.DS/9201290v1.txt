We construct the "spectral" decomposition of the sets \bar{Per\,f}, \omega(f)=\cup\omega(x) and \Omega(f) for a continuous map f of the interval to itself. Several corollaries are obtained; the main ones describe the generic properties of f-invariant measures, the structure of the set \Omega(f)\setminus \bar{Per\,f} and the generic limit behavior of an orbit for maps without wandering intervals. The "spectral" decomposition for piecewise-monotone maps is deduced from the Decomposition Theorem. Finally we explain how to extend the results of the present paper for a continuous map of a one-dimensional branched manifold into itself.
