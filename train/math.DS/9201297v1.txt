We prove the existence of at least cl(M) periodic orbits for certain time dependant Hamiltonian systems on the cotangent bundle of an arbitrary compact manifold M. These Hamiltonians are not necessarily convex but they satisfy a certain boundary condition given by a Riemannian metric on M. We discretize the variational problem by decomposing the time 1 map into a product of ``symplectic twist maps''. A second theorem deals with homotopically non trivial orbits in manifolds of negative curvature.
