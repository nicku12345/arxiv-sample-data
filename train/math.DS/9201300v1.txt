A general construction for \sigma-finite absolutely continuous invariant measure will be presented. It will be shown that the local bounded distortion of the Radon-Nykodym derivatives of f^n_*(\lambda) will imply the existence of a \sigma-finite invariant measure for the map f which is absolutely continuous with respect to \lambda, a measure on the phase space describing the sets of measure zero. Furthermore we will discuss sufficient conditions for the existence of \sigma-finite invariant absolutely continuous measures for real 1-dimensional dynamical systems.
