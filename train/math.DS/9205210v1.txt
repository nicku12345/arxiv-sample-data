This paper concerns the dynamics of polynomial automorphisms of {\bf C}^2. One can associate to such an automorphism two currents \mu^\pm and the equilibrium measure \mu=\mu^+\wedge\mu^-. In this paper we study some geometric and dynamical properties of these objects. First, we characterize \mu as the unique measure of maximal entropy. Then we show that the measure \mu has a local product structure and that the currents \mu^\pm have a laminar structure. This allows us to deduce information about periodic points and heteroclinic intersections. For example, we prove that the support of \mu coincides with the closure of the set of saddle points. The methods used combine the pluripotential theory with the theory of non-uniformly hyperbolic dynamical systems.
