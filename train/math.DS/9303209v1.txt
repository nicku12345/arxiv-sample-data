We prove that if A is the basin of immediate attraction to a periodic attracting or parabolic point for a rational map f on the Riemann sphere, if A is completely invariant (i.e. f^{-1}(A)=A), and if \mu is an arbitrary f-invariant measure with positive Lyapunov exponents on the boundary of A, then \mu-almost every point q in the boundary of A is accessible along a curve from A. In fact we prove the accessability of every "good" q i.e. such q for which "small neighbourhoods arrive at large scale" under iteration of f. This generalizes Douady-Eremenko-Levin-Petersen theorem on the accessability of periodic sources.
