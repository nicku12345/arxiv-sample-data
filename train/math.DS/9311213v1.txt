According to Sullivan, a space {\cal E} of unimodal maps with the same combinatorics (modulo smooth conjugacy) should be treated as an infinitely-dimensional Teichm\"{u}ller space. This is a basic idea in Sullivan's approach to the Renormalization Conjecture. One of its principle ingredients is to supply {\cal E} with the Teichm\"{u}ller metric. To have such a metric one has to know, first of all, that all maps of {\cal E} are quasi-symmetrically conjugate. This was proved [Ji] and [JS] for some classes of non-renormalizable maps (when the critical point is not too recurrent). Here we consider a space of non-renormalizable unimodal maps with in a sense fastest possible recurrence of the critical point (called Fibonacci). Our goal is to supply this space with the Teichm\"{u}ller metric.
