In this paper we shall show that there exists a polynomial unimodal map f: [0,1] -> [0,1] which is   1) non-renormalizable(therefore for each x from a residual set, \omega(x) is equal to an interval),   2) for which \omega(c) is a Cantor set, and   3) for which \omega(x)=\omega(c) for Lebesgue almost all x.   So the topological and the metric attractor of such a map do not coincide. This gives the answer to a question posed by Milnor.
