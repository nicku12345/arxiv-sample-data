In this paper we shall show that there exists L_0 such that for each even integer L >= L_0 there exists c_1 \in \rz for which the Julia set of z --> z^L + c_1 has positive Lebesgue measure. This solves an old problem.   Editor's note: In 1997, it was shown by Xavier Buff that there was a serious flaw in the argument, leaving a gap in the proof. Currently (1999), the question of polynomials with a positive measure Julia sets remains open.
