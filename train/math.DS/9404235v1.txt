A dynamical zeta function \zeta and a transfer operator \scr L are associated with a piecewise monotone map f of the interval [0,1] and a weight function g. The analytic properties of \zeta and the spectral properties of \scr L are related by a theorem of Baladi and Keller under an assumption of ``generating partition''. It is shown here how to remove this assumption and, in particular, extend the theorem of Baladi and Keller to the case when f has negative Schwarzian derivative.
