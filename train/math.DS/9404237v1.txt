Let H^d be the set of all rational maps of degree d\ge 2 on the Riemann sphere which are expanding on Julia set. We prove that if f\in H^d and all or all but one critical points (or values) are in the immediate basin of attraction to an attracting fixed point then there exists a polynomial in the component H(f) of H^d containing f. If all critical points are in the immediate basin of attraction to an attracting fixed point or parabolic fixed point then f restricted to Julia set is conjugate to the shift on the one-sided shift space of d symbols.   We give exotic examples of maps of an arbitrary degree d with a non-simply connected, completely invariant basin of attraction and arbitrary number k \ge 2 of critical points in the basin. For such a map f\in H^d with k<d there is no polynomial in H(f).   Finally we describe a computer experiment joining an exotic example to a Newton's method (for a polynomial) rational function with a 1-parameter family of rational maps.
