Given a C^{1+\gamma} hyperbolic Cantor set C, we study the sequence C_{n,x} of Cantor subsets which nest down toward a point x in C. We show that C_{n,x} is asymptotically equal to an ergodic Cantor set valued process. The values of this process, called limit sets, are indexed by a H\"older continuous set-valued function defined on D. Sullivan's dual Cantor set. We show the limit sets are themselves C^{k+\gamma}, C^\infty or C^\omega hyperbolic Cantor sets, with the highest degree of smoothness which occurs in the C^{1+\gamma} conjugacy class of C. The proof of this leads to the following rigidity theorem: if two C^{k+\gamma}, C^\infty or C^\omega hyperbolic Cantor sets are C^1-conjugate, then the conjugacy (with a different extension) is in fact already C^{k+\gamma}, C^\infty or C^\omega.   Within one C^{1+\gamma} conjugacy class, each smoothness class is a Banach manifold, which is acted on by the semigroup given by rescaling subintervals. Conjugacy classes nest down, and contained in the intersection of them all is a compact set which is the attractor for the semigroup: the collection of limit sets. Convergence is exponentially fast, in the C^1 norm.
