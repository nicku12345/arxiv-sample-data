We announce the discovery of a diffeomorphism of a three-dimensional manifold with boundary which has two disjoint attractors. Each attractor attracts a set of positive 3-dimensional Lebesgue measure whose points of Lebesgue density are dense in the whole manifold. This situation is stable under small perturbations.
