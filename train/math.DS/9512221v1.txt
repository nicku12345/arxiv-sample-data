Using Thurston's characterization of postcritically finite rational functions as branched coverings of the sphere to itself, we give a new method of constructing new conformal dynamical systems out of old ones. Let f(z) be a rational map and suppose that the postcritical set P(f) is finite. Let \alpha be an embedded closed arc in the sphere and suppose that f|{\alpha} is a homeomorphism. Define a branched covering g as follows. Cut the sphere open along \alpha. Glue in a closed disc D. Map S^{2} - \Int (D) via f and \Int (D) by a homeomorphism to the complement of f(\alpha). We prove theorems which give combinatorial conditions on f and \alpha for g to be equivalent in the sense of Thurston to a rational map. The main idea in our proofs is a general theorem which forces a possible obstruction for g away from the disc D on which the new dynamics is defined.
