This is a continuation of the series of notes on the dynamics of quadratic polynomials. We show the following   Rigidity Theorem: Any combinatorial class contains at most one quadratic polynomial satisfying the secondary limbs condition with a-priori bounds.   As a corollary, such maps are combinatorially and topologically rigid, and as a consequence, the Mandelbrot set is locally connected at the correspoinding parameter values.
