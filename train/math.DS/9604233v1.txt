We study the characteristic exponents of the Hamiltonian system of n (\ge 2) point masses m_1,\dots,m_n freely falling in the vertical half line \{q|\, q\ge 0\} under constant gravitation and colliding with each other and the solid floor q=0 elastically. This model was introduced and first studied by M. Wojtkowski. Hereby we prove his conjecture: All relevant characteristic (Lyapunov) exponents of the above dynamical system are nonzero, provided that m_1\ge\dots\ge m_n (i. e. the masses do not increase as we go up) and m_1\ne m_2.
