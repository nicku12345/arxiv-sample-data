In this paper we give a combinatorial description of the renormlization limits of infinitely renormalizable unimodal maps with {\it essentially bounded} combinatorics admitting quadratic-like complex extensions. As an application we construct a natural analogue of the period-doubling fixed point. Dynamical hairiness is also proven for maps in this class. These results are proven by analyzing {\it parabolic towers}: sequences of maps related either by renormalization or by {\it parabolic renormalization}.
