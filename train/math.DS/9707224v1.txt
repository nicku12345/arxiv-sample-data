We prove uniform hyperbolicity of the renormalization operator for all possible real combinatorial types. We derive from it that the set of infinitely renormalizable parameter values in the real quadratic family P_c: x\mapsto x^2+c has zero measure. This yields the statement in the title (where ``regular'' means to have an attracting cycle and ``stochastic'' means to have an absolutely continuous invariant measure). An application to the MLC problem is given.
