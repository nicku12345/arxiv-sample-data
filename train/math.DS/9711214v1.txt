We prove that two C^r critical circle maps with the same rotation number of bounded type are C^{1+\alpha} conjugate for some \alpha>0 provided their successive renormalizations converge together at an exponential rate in the C^0 sense. The number \alpha depends only on the rate of convergence. We also give examples of C^\infty critical circle maps with the same rotation number that are not C^{1+\beta} conjugate for any \beta>0.
