We consider perturbations of quadratic maps f_a admitting an absolutely continuous invariant probability measure, where a is in a certain positive measure set \mathcal{A} of parameters, and show that in any neighborhood of any such an f_a, we find a rich fauna of dynamics. There are maps with periodic attractors as well as non-periodic maps whose critical orbit is absorbed by the continuation of any prescribed hyperbolic repeller of f_a. In particular, Misiurewicz maps are dense in \mathcal{A}. Almost all maps f_a in the quadratic family is known to possess a unique natural measure, that is, an invariant probability measure \mu_a describing the asymptotic distribution of almost all orbits. We discuss weak*-(dis)continuity properties of the map a\mapsto \mu_a near the set \mathcal{A}, and prove that almost all maps in \mathcal{A} have the property that \mu_a can be approximated with measures supported on periodic attractors of certain nearby maps. On the other hand, for any a \in \mathcal{A} and any periodic repeller \Gamma_a of f_a, the singular measure supported on \Gamma_a can also approximated with measures supported on nearby periodic attractors. It follows that a\mapsto \mu_a is not weak*continuous on any full-measure subset of (0,2]. Some of these results extend to unimodal families with critical point of higher order, and even to not-too-flat flat topped families.
