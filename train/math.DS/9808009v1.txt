Let F be a quadratic rational map of the sphere which has two fixed Siegel disks with bounded type rotation numbers theta and nu. Using a new degree 3 Blaschke product model for the dynamics of F and an adaptation of complex a priori bounds for renormalization of critical circle maps, we prove that F can be realized as the mating of two Siegel quadratic polynomials with the corresponding rotation numbers theta and nu.
