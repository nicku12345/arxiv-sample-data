The goals of this paper are first to describe and then to apply an ergodic-theoretic generalization of the Siegel integral formula from the geometry of numbers. The general formula will be seen to serve both as a guide and as a tool for questions concerning the distribution, in senses to be made precise, of the set of closed leaves of measured foliations subordinate to meromorphic quadratic differentials on closed Riemann surfaces.
