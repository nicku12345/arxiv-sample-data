For the ordinary differential equation (ODE) \dot{x}(t) = f(t,x), x(0) = x_0, t\geq 0, x\in R^d, assume f to be at least continuous in t and locally Lipshitz in x, and if necessary, several times continuously differentiable in t and x. We associate a conditioning function E(t) with each solution x(t) which captures the accumulation of global error in a numerical approximation in the following sense: if \tilde{x}(t;h) is an approximation derived from a single step method of time step h and order r then \norm{\tilde{x}(t;h) - x(t)} < K(E(t)+\epsilon)h^r for 0\leq t\leq T, any \epsilon > 0, sufficiently small h, and a constant K>0.   Using techniques from the stability theory of differential equations, this paper gives conditions on x(t) for E(t) to be upper bounded linearly or by a constant for t\geq 0. More concretely, these techniques give constant or linear bounds on E(t) when x(t) is a trajectory of a dynamical system which falls into a stable, hyperbolic fixed point; or into a stable, hyperbolic cycle; or into a normally hyperbolic and contracting manifold with quasiperiodic flow on the manifold.
