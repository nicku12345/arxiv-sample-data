Let f(z)=e^{2i\pi\theta} z+z^2, where \theta is a quadratic irrational. McMullen proved that the Siegel disk for f is self-similar about the critical point. We give a lower bound for the ratio of self-similarity, and we show that if \theta=(\sqrt 5-1)/2 is the golden mean, then there exists a triangle contained in the Siegel disk, and with one vertex at the critical point. This answers a 15 year old conjecture.
