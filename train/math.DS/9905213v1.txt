Given ergodic p-invariant measures {\mu_i} on the 1-torus T=R/Z, we give a sharp condition on their entropies, guaranteeing that the entropy of the convolution \muon converges to \log p. We also prove a variant of this result for joinings of full entropy on \T^\N. In conjunction with a method of Host, this yields the following. Denote \sig_q(x) = qx\pmod{1}. Then for every p-invariant ergodic \mu with positive entropy, \frac{1}{N}\sum_{n=0}^{N-1}\sig_{c_n}\mu converges weak^* to Lebesgue measure as N \goesto \infty, under a certain mild combinatorial condition on {c_k}. (For instance, the condition is satisfied if p=10 and c_k=2^k+6^k or c_k=2^{2^k}.) This extends a result of Johnson and Rudolph, who considered the sequence c_k = q^k when p and q are multiplicatively independent.   We also obtain the following corollary concerning Hausdorff dimension of sum sets: For any sequence {S_i} of p-invariant closed subsets of T, if \sum \dim_H(S_i) / |\log\dim_H(S_i)| = \infty, then \dim_H(S_1 + \cdots + S_n) \goesto 1.
