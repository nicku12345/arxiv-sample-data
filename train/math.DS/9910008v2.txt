Let M be a one-holed torus with boundary \partial M (a circle) and \Gamma the mapping class group of M fixing \partial M. The group \Gamma acts on {\mathcal M}_{\mathcal C}(SU(2)) which is the space of SU(2)-gauge equivalence classes of flat SU(2)-connections on M with fixed holonomy on \partial M. We study the topological dynamics of the \Gamma-action and give conditions for the individual \Gamma-orbits to be dense in {\mathcal M}_{\mathcal C}(SU(2)).
