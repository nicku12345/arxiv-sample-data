Let M be a Riemann surface with boundary \partial M and genus greater than zero. Let \Gamma be the mapping class group of M fixing \partial M. The group \Gamma acts on {\mathcal M}_{\mathcal C} = \Hom_{\mathcal C}(\pi_1(M),SU(2)/SU(2) which is the space of SU(2)-gauge equivalence classes of flat SU(2)-connections on M with fixed holonomy on \partial M. We study the topological dynamics of the \Gamma-action and give conditions for the individual \Gamma-orbits to be dense in {\mathcal M}_{\mathcal C}.
