We introduce a weakened version of the Dunford-Pettis property, and give examples of Banach spaces with this property. In particular, we show that every closed subspace of Schreier's space S enjoys it. As an application, we characterize the weak polynomial convergence of sequences, show that every closed subspace of S has the polynomial Dunford-Pettis property of Bistr\"om et al. and give other polynomial properties of S.
