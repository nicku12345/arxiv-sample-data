We show that a complemented subspace of a locally convex direct sum of an uncountable collection of Banach spaces is a locally convex direct sum of complemented subspaces of countable subsums. As a corollary we prove that a complemented subspace of a locally convex direct sum of arbitrary collection of \ell_{1}(\Gamma)-spaces is isomorphic to a locally convex direct sum of \ell_{1}(\Gamma)-spaces.
