Given Banach spaces E and F, we denote by {\mathcal P}(^k!E,F) the space of all k-homogeneous (continuous) polynomials from E into F, and by {\mathcal P}_{wb}(^k!E,F) the subspace of polynomials which are weak-to-norm continuous on bounded sets. It is shown that if E has an unconditional finite dimensional expansion of the identity, the following assertions are equivalent: (a) {\mathcal P}(^k!E,F)={\mathcal P}_{wb}(^k!E,F); (b) {\mathcal P}_{wb}(^k!E,F) contains no copy of c_0; (c) {\mathcal P}(^k!E,F) contains no copy of \ell_\infty; (d) {\mathcal P}_{wb}(^k!E,F) is complemented in {\mathcal P}(^k!E,F). This result was obtained by Kalton for linear operators. As an application, we show that if E has Pe\l czy\'nski's property (V) and satisfies {\mathcal P}(^k!E) ={\mathcal P}_{wb}(^k!E) then, for all F, every unconditionally converging P\in{\mathcal P}(^k!E,F) is weakly compact. If E has an unconditional finite dimensional expansion of the identity, then the converse is also true.
