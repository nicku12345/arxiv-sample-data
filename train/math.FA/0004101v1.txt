We show that, in some cases, the projective and the injective tensor products of two Banach spaces do not have the Dunford-Pettis property (DPP). As a consequence, we obtain that (c_0\hat{\otimes}_\pi c_0)^{**} fails the DPP. Since (c_0\hat{\otimes}_\pi c_0)^{*} does enjoy it, this provides a new space with the DPP whose dual fails to have it. We also prove that, if E and F are {\mathscr L}_1-spaces, then E\hat{\otimes}_\epsilon F has the DPP if and only if both E and F have the Schur property. Other results and examples are given.
