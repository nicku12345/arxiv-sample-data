Let \cal M be a semi-finite von Neumann algebra equipped with a distinguished faithful, normal, semi-finite trace \tau. We introduce the notion of equi-integrability in non-commutative spaces and show that if a rearrangement invariant quasi-Banach function space E on the positive semi-axis is \alpha-convex with constant 1 and satisfies a non-trivial lower q-estimate with constant 1, then the corresponding non-commutative space of measurable operators E({\cal M}, \tau) has the following property: every bounded sequence in E({\cal M}, \tau) has a subsequence that splits into a E-equi-integrable sequence and a sequence with pairwise disjoint projection supports. This result extends the well known Kadec-Pe\l czy\'nski subsequence decomposition for Banach lattices to non-commutative spaces. As applications, we prove that for 1\leq p <\infty, every subspace of L^p(\cal M, \tau) either contains almost isometric copies of \ell^p or is strongly embedded in L^p(\cal M, \tau).
