Let \M be a semi-finite von Neumann algebra equipped with a faithful normal trace \tau. We study the subspace structures of non-commutative Lorentz spaces L_{p,q}(\M, \tau), extending results of Carothers and Dilworth to the non-commutative settings. In particular, we show that, under natural conditions on indices, \ell_p can not be embedded into L_{p,q}(\M, \tau). As applications, we prove that for 0<p<\infty with p \neq 2 then \ell_p cannot be strongly embedded into L_p(\M,\tau). Thus providing a non-commutative extension of a result of Kalton for 0<p<1 and a result of Rosenthal for 1\leq p <2 on L_p[0,1].
