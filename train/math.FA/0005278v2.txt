Let X be a Banach space. We introduce a formal approach which seems to be useful in the study of those properties of operators on X which depend only on the norms of images of elements. This approach is applied to the Daugavet equation for norms of operators; in particular we develop a general theory of narrow operators and rich subspaces of X previously studied in the context of the classical spaces C(K) and L_1(\mu).
