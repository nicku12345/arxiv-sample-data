Using a calibration method, we prove that, if w is a function which satisfies all Euler conditions for the Mumford-Shah functional on a two-dimensional domain, and the discontinuity set S of w is a regular curve connecting two boundary points, then there exists a uniform neighbourhood U of S such that w is a minimizer of the Mumford-Shah functional on U with respect to its own boundary conditions. We show that Euler conditions do not guarantee in general the minimality of w in the class of functions with the same boundary value of w and whose extended graph is contained in a neighbourhood of the extended graph of w, and we give a sufficient condition in terms of the geometrical properties of the domain and the discontinuity set under which this kind of minimality holds.
