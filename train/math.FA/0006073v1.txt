Using a calibration method, we prove that, if w is a function which satisfies all Euler conditions for the Mumford-Shah functional on a two-dimensional open set \Omega, and the discontinuity set of w is a segment connecting two boundary points, then for every point (x_0, y_0) of \Omega there exists a neighbourhood U of (x_0, y_0) such that w is a minimizer of the Mumford-Shah functional on U with respect to its own boundary values on \partial U.
