In this paper we establish several relations between the determinants of the following structured matrices: Hankel matrices, symmetric Toeplitz + Hankel matrices and Toeplitz matrices. Using known results for the asymptotic behavior of Toeplitz determinants, these identities are used in order to obtain Fisher-Hartwig type results on the asymptotics of certain skewsymmetric Toeplitz determinants and certain Hankel determinants.
