In this paper we study the asymptotic behaviour via Gamma-convergence of some integral functionals which model some multi-dimensional structures and depend explicitly on the linearized strain tensor. The functionals are defined in particular classes of functions with bounded deformation while the limit problem is set in the usual framework of Sobolev spaces or BD. We also construct an example of such functionals showing that under some special assumptions we can have non local effects.
