Measures on a non-Archimedean Banach space X are considered with values in the real field \bf R and in the non- Archimedean fields. The non-Archimedean analogs of the Bochner- Kolmogorov and Minlos-Sazonov theorems are given. Moreover, infinite products of measures are studied and the analog of the Kakutani theorem is investigated.
