Let a sequence (P_n) of polynomials in one complex variable satisfy a recurre ce relation with length growing slowlier than linearly. It is shown that (P_n)  is an orthonormal basis in L^2_{\mu} for some measure \mu on \C, if and o ly if the recurrence is a 3-term relation with special coefficients. The supp rt of \mu lies on a straight line. This result is achieved by the analysis of a formally normal irreducible Hessenberg operator with only finitely many nonzero entries in every row. It generalizes the classical Favard's Theorem and the Representation Theorem.
