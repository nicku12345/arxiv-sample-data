We give criteria of total incomparability for certain classes of mixed Tsirelson spaces. We show that spaces of the form T[(M_k,\theta_k)_{k=1}^{\ell}] with index i(M_k) finite are either c_0 or \ell_p saturated for some p and we characterize when any two spaces of such a form are totally incomparable in terms of the index i(M_k) and the parameter \theta_k. Also, we give sufficient conditions of total incomparability for a particular class of spaces of the form T[(A_k,\theta_k)_{k=1}^\infty] in terms of the asymptotic behaviour of the sequence \Vert\sum_{i=1}^n e_i\Vert where (e_i) is the canonical basis.
