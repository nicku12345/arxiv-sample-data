Linear combinations of exponentials e^{i\lambda_kt} in the case where the distance between some points \lambda_k tends to zero are studied. D. Ullrich has proved the basis property of the divided differences of exponentials in the case when the groups consist of equal number of points all of them are close enough to integers. We have generalized this result for groups with arbitrary number of close points and obtained a full description of Riesz bases of exponential divided differences. The application to a control problem is presented.
