We study the existence of cubic quotients of finite-dimensional quasi-normed spaces, that is, quotients well isomorphic to \ell_{\infty}^k for some k. We give two results of this nature. The first guarantees a proportional dimensional cubic quotient when the envelope is cubic; the second gives an estimate for the size of a cubic quotient in terms of a measure of non-convexity of the quasi-norm.
