A class of growth functions u is introduced to construct Hida distributions and test functions. The Legendre transform \ell_{u} of u is used to define a sequence \a(n)=(\ell_{u}(n) n!)^{-1}, n\geq 0, of positive numbers. From this sequence we get a CKS-space. Under various conditions on u we show that the associated sequence \{\a(n)\} satisfies those conditions for carrying out the white noise distribution theory on the CKS-space. We show that u and its dual Legendre transform u^{*} are growth functions for test and generalized functions, respectively, in the characterization theorems.
