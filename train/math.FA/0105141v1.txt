Using a calibration method we prove that, if \Gamma\subset \Omega is a closed regular hypersurface and if the function g is discontinuous along \Gamma and regular outside, then the function u_{\beta} which solves  \begin{cases} \Delta u_{\beta}=\beta(u_{\beta}-g)& \text{in \Omega\setminus\Gamma} \partial_{\nu} u_{\beta}=0 & \text{on \partial\Omega\cup\Gamma} \end{cases}  is in turn discontinuous along \Gamma and it is the unique absolute minimizer of the non-homogeneous Mumford-Shah functional  \int_{\Omega\setminus S_u}|\nabla u|^2 dx +{\cal H}^{n-1}(S_u)+\beta\int_{\Omega\setminus S_u}(u-g)^2 dx,  over SBV(\Omega), for \beta large enough. Applications of the result to the study of the gradient flow by the method of minimizing movements are shown.
