If p\in [1,+\infty] and T is a linear operator with p-nuclear adjoint from a Banach space  X to a Banach space Y then if one of the spaces X^* or Y^{***} has the approximation property, then T belongs to the ideal N^p of operators which can be factored through diagonal oparators l_{p'}\to l_1. On the other hand, there is a Banach space W such that W^{**} has a basis and such that for each p\in [1,+\infty], p\neq 2, there exists an operator T: W^{**}\to W with p-nuclear adjoint that is not in the ideal N^p, as an operator from W^{**} to  W.
