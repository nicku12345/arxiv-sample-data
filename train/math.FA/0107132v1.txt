We show that if T is a narrow operator on X=X_{1}\oplus_{1} X_{2} or X=X_{1}\oplus_{\infty} X_{2}, then the restrictions to X_{1} and X_{2} are narrow and conversely. We also characterise by a version of the Daugavet property for positive operators on Banach lattices which unconditional sums of Banach spaces inherit the Daugavet property, and we study the Daugavet property for ultraproducts.
