We give conditions on a pair of Banach spaces X and Y, under which each operator from X to Y, whose second adjoint factors compactly through the space l^p, 1\le p\le+\infty, itself compactly factors through l^p. The conditions are as follows: either the space X^*, or the space Y^{***} possesses the Grothendieck approximation property. Leaving the corresponding question for parameters p>1, p\neq 2, still open, we show that for p=1 the conditions are essential.
