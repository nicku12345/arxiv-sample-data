We consider the nonlinear Sturm-Liouville differential operator F(u) = -u'' + f(u) for u \in H^2_D([0, \pi]), a Sobolev space of functions satisfying Dirichlet boundary conditions. For a generic nonlinearity f: \RR \to \RR we show that there is a diffeomorphism in the domain of F converting the critical set C of F into a union of isolated parallel hyperplanes. For the proof, we show that the homotopy groups of connected components of C are trivial and prove results which permit to replace homotopy equivalences of systems of infinite dimensional Hilbert manifolds by diffeomorphisms.
