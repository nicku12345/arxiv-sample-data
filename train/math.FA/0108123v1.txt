We investigate quasi-Banach operator ideal products ({\frak{A}}\circ{\frak{B}},\mathbf{A\circ B}) which contain (\frak{L}_2, \mathbf{L}_2) as a factor. In particular, we ask for conditions which guarantee that \mathbf{A\circ B} is even a norm if each factor of the product is a 1-Banach ideal. In doing so, we reveal the strong influence of the existence of such a norm in relation to the accessibility of the product ideal and the structure of its factors.
