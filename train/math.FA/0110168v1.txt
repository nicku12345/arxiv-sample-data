Let X be a rearrangement-invariant space. An operator T: X\to X is called narrow if for each measurable set A and each \epsilon > 0 there exists x \in X with x^2= \chi_A, \int x d \mu = 0 and \| Tx \| < \epsilon. In particular all compact operators are narrow. We prove that if X is a Lorentz function space L_{w,p} on [0,1] with p>2, then there exists a constant k_X>1 so that for every narrow projection P on L_{w,p} \| Id - P \| \geq k_X.  This generalizes earlier results on L_p and partially answers a question of E. M. Semenov. Moreover we prove that every rearrangement-invariant function space X with an absolutely continuous norm contains a complemented subspace isomorphic to X which is the range of a narrow projection and a non-narrow projection, which gives a negative answer to a question of A.Plichko and M.Popov.
