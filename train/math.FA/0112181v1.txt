We give a characterization of conditional expectation operators through a disjointness type property similar to band preserving operators. We say that the operator T:X\to X on a Banach lattice X is semi band preserving if and only if for all f, g \in X, f \perp Tg implies that Tf \perp Tg. We prove that when   X is a purely atomic Banach lattice, then an operator T on X is a weighted conditional expectation operator if and only if T is semi band preserving.
