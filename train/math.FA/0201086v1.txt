In this paper we have characterized the space of summability kernels for the case p=1 and p=2. For other values of p we give a necessary condition for a function \Lambda to be a summability kernel. For the case p=1, we have studied the properties of measures which are transferred from M(\mathbb Z) to M(\mathbb R) through summability kernels. Further, we have extended every l_p(\mathbb Z) sequences to L^q(\mathbb R) multipliers for certain values of p and q.
