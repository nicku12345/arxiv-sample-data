For a metric space (K,d) the Banach space \Lip(K) consists of all scalar-valued bounded Lipschitz functions on K with the norm \|f\|_{L}=\max(\|f\|_{\infty},L(f)), where L(f) is the Lipschitz constant of f. The closed subspace \lip(K) of \Lip(K) contains all elements of \Lip(K) satisfying the \lip-condition \lim_{0<d(x,y)\to 0}|f(x)-f(y)|/d(x,y)=0. For K=([0,1],| {\cdot} |^{\alpha}), 0<\alpha<1, we prove that \lip(K) is a proper M-ideal in a certain subspace of \Lip(K) containing a copy of \ell^{\infty}.
