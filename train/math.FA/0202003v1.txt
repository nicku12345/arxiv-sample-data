The methods of "minimal vectors" were introduced by Ansari and Enflo and strengthened by Pearcy, in order to prove the existence of hyperinvariant subspaces for certain operators on Hilbert space. In this note we present the method of minimal vectors for operators on super-reflexive Banach spaces and we give a new sufficient condition for the existence of hyperinvariant subspaces of certain operators on these spaces.
