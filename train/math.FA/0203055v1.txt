We consider real spaces only.   Definition. An operator T:X\to Y between Banach spaces X and Y is called a Hahn-Banach operator if for every isometric embedding of the space X into a Banach space Z there exists a norm-preserving extension \tilde T of T to Z.   A geometric property of Hahn-Banach operators of finite rank acting between finite-dimensional normed spaces is found. This property is used to characterize pairs of finite-dimensional normed spaces (X,Y) such that there exists a Hahn-Banach operator T:X\to Y of rank k. The latter result is a generalization of a recent result due to B.L. Chalmers and B. Shekhtman.
