Results on products of the distributions x_{\pm}^{a} and \de^{(p)}(x) with coinciding singularities are derived when the products are balanced so that they exist in the distribution space. These results follow the idea of a known result on distributional products published by Jan Mikusi\'nski in 1966. They are obtained in Colombeau algebra \EuScript{G}(\mathbb{R}) of generalized functions that contains the distribution space and the notion of 'association' in it allows obtaining results in terms of distributions.
