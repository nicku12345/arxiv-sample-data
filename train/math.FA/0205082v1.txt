We characterize norm one complemented subspaces of Orlicz sequence spaces \ell_M equipped with either Luxemburg or Orlicz norm, provided that the Orlicz function M is sufficiently smooth and sufficiently different from the square function. This paper concentrates on the more difficult real case, the complex case follows from previously known results.
