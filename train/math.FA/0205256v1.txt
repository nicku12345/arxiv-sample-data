We extend the concept of amenability of a Banach algebra A to the case that there is an extra \mathfrak A-module structure on A, and show that when S is an inverse semigroup with subsemigroup E of idempotents, then A=\ell^1(S) as a Banach module over \mathfrak A=\ell^1(E) is module amenable iff S is amenable. When S is a discrete group, \ell^1(E)=\mathbb C and this is just the celebrated Johnson's theorem.
