In this note we describe conditions under which, in idempotent functional analysis, linear operators have integral representations in terms of idempotent integral of V. P. Maslov. We define the notion of nuclear idempotent semimodule and describe idempotent analogs of the classical kernel theorems of L. Schwartz and A. Grothendieck. Our results provide a general description of a class of subsemimodules of the semimodule of all bounded functions with values in the Max-Plus algebra where some kind of kernel theorem holds, thus addressing an open problem posed by J. Gunawardena. Previously, some theorems on integral representations were obtained for a number of specific semimodules consisting of continuous or bounded functions taking values mostly in the Max-Plus algebra. In this work, a rather general case of semimodules over boundedly complete idempotent semirings is considered.
