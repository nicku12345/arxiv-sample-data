A topological description of various generalized function algebras over corresponding basic locally convex algebras is given. The framework consists of algebras of sequences with appropriate ultra(pseudo)metrics defined by sequences of exponential weights. Such an algebra with embedded Dirac's delta distribution induces discrete topology on the basic space. This result is in analogy to Schwartz' impossibility result concerning multiplication of distributions.
