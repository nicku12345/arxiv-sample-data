W.B. Johnson has constructed a series of Banach spaces non isomorphic to the Hilbert one that have the hereditarily approximation property (shortly hereditarily AP): all their subspaces also have the AP. All these examples were ''sufficiently'' non-symmetric and this fact allows Johnson to ask: whether there exists any Banach space X with symmetric (or, at least, subsymmetric) basis, distinct from the Hilbert space such that each its subspace has the AP? In this paper is shown that there is a Banach space with a subsymmetric basis (non-equivalent to any symmetric one), which enjoys the hereditarily AP.
