We prove three results on wavelets for the Hardy space H^2(\R). All wavelets constructed so far for H^2(\R) are MSF wavelets. We construct a family of H^2-wavelets which are not MSF. An equivalence relation on H^2-wavelets is introduced and it is shown that the corresponding equivalence classes are non-empty. Finally, we construct a family of H^2-wavelets with Fourier transform discontinuous at the origin.
