Many of the known complemented subspaces of L_p have realizations as sequence spaces. In this paper a systematic approach to defining these spaces which uses partitions and weights is introduced. This approach gives a unified description of many well-known complemented subspaces of L_p. It is proved that the class of spaces with such norms is stable under (p,2) sums. By introducing the notion of an envelope norm, we obtain a necessary condition for a Banach sequence space with norm given by partitions and weights to be isomorphic to a subspace of L_p. Using this we define a space Y_n with norm given by partitions and weights with distance to any subspace of L_p growing with n. This allows us to construct an example of a Banach space with norm given by partitions and weights which is not isomorphic to a subspace of L_p.
