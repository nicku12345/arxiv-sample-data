In a recent paper, we gave a topological description of Colombeau type algebras introducing algebras of sequences with exponential weights. Embeddings of Schwartz' spaces into the Colombeau algebra G are well known, but for ultradistribution and periodic hyperfunction type spaces we give new constructions. We show that the multiplication of regular enough functions (smooth, ultradifferentiable or quasianalytic), embedded into corresponding algebras, is the ordinary multiplication.
