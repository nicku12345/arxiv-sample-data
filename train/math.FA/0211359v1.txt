(1) Let A be an operator on a space {\cal H} of even finite dimension. Then for some decomposition {\cal H}={\cal F}\oplus{\cal F}^{\perp}, the compressions of A onto {\cal F} and {\cal F}^{\perp} are unitarily equivalent. (2) Let \{A_j\}_{j=0}^n be a family of strictly positive operators on a space {\cal H}. Then, for some integer k, we can dilate each A_j into a positive operator B_j on \oplus^k{\cal H} in such a way that: (i) The operator diagonal of B_j consists of a repetition of A_j. (ii) There exist a positive operator B on \oplus^k{\cal H} and an increasing function f_j : (0,\infty)\longrightarrow(0,\infty) such that B_j=f_j(B).
