In this paper we extend the Balian--Low theorem, which is a version of the uncertainty principle for Gabor (Weyl--Heisenberg) systems, to functions of several variables. In particular, we first prove the Balian--Low theorem for arbitrary quadratic forms. Then we generalize further and prove the Balian--Low theorem for differential operators associated with a symplectic basis for the symplectic form on {\mathbb R}^{2d}.
