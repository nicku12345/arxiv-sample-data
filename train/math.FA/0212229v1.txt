We consider linear operators T mapping a couple of weighted L_p spaces \{L_{p_0}(U_0), L_{p_1}(U_1)\} into \{L_{q_0}(V_0), L_{q_1}(V_1)\} for any 1\le p_0,  p_1, q_0, q_1\le\infty, and describe the interpolation orbit of any a\in L_{p_0}(U_0)+ L_{p_1}(U_1) that is we describe a space of all \{Ta\}, where T runs over all linear bounded mappings from \{L_{p_0}(U_0), L_{p_1}(U_1)\} into \{L_{q_0}(V_0),L_{q_1}(V_1)\}. We present in this paper the proofs of results which were announced in V.I.Ovchinnikov, C. R. Acad. Sci. Paris Ser. I 334 (2002) 881--884.   We show that interpolation orbit is obtained by the Lions--Peetre method of means with functional parameter as well as by the K-method with a weighted Orlicz space as a parameter.
