The class of operator-valued functions which are homogeneous of degree one, holomorphic in the open right polyhalfplane, have positive semidefinite real parts there and take selfadjoint operator values at real points, and its subclass consisting of functions representable in the form of Schur complement of a block of a linear pencil of operators with positive semidefinite operator coefficients, are investigated. The latter subclass is a generalization of the class of characteristic matrix functions of passive 2n-poles considered as functions of impedances of its elements, which was introduced by M. F. Bessmertny\u\i. Several equivalent characterizations of the generalized Bessmertny\u{\i} class are given, and its intimate connection with the Agler--Schur class of holomorphic contractive operator-valued functions on the unit polydisk is established.
