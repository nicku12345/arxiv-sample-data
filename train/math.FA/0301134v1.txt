We show that (g_2,a,b) is a Gabor frame when a>0, b>0, ab<1 and g_2(t)=({1/2}\pi \gamma)^{{1/2}} (\cosh \pi \gamma t)^{-1} is a hyperbolic secant with scaling parameter \gamma >0. This is accomplished by expressing the Zak transform of g_2 in terms of the Zak transform of the Gaussian g_1(t)=(2\gamma)^{{1/4}} \exp (-\pi \gamma t^2), together with an appropriate use of the Ron-Shen criterion for being a Gabor frame. As a side result it follows that the windows, generating tight Gabor frames, that are canonically associated to g_2 and g_1 are the same at critical density a=b=1. Also, we display the ``singular'' dual function corresponding to the hyperbolic secant at critical density.
