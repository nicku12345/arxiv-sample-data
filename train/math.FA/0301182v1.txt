We show that a minor refinement of the Bourgain-Rosenthal construction of a Banach space without the Radon-Nikodym property which contains no bounded \delta-trees yields a space with the Daugavet property and the Schur property. Using this example we answer some open questions on the structure of such spaces; in particular we show that the Daugavet property is not inherited by ultraproducts.
