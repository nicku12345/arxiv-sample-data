For a new class of topological vector spaces, namely \kappa -normed spaces, and associated quasisemilinear topological preordered space is defined and investigated. This structure arise naturally from the consideration of a \kappa -norm, that is a distance function between a point and a G_{\delta}-subset. For it, analogs of the Hahn-Banach theorem are proved.
