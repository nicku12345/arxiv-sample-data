This paper is a continuation of the paper (A.G.Ramm, Amer. Math. Monthly, 108, N 9, (2001), 855-860), where bounded Fredholm operators are studied. The theory of bounded linear Fredholm-type operators is presented in many texts. This paper is written for a broad audience and the author tries to give simple and short arguments.
