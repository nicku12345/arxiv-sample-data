We prove some inequalities for the spectral radius of positive operators on Banach function spaces. In particular, we show the following extension of Levinger's theorem. Let K be a positive compact kernel operator on L^2(X,\mu) with the spectral radius r(K). Then the function \phi defined by \phi(t) = r(t K + (1-t) K^*) is non-decreasing on [0, {1/2}]. We also prove that \| A + B^* \| \ge 2 \cdot \sqrt{r(A B)} for any positive operators A and B on L^2(X,\mu).
