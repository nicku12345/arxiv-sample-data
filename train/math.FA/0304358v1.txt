Suppose A is a positive real linear transformation on a finite dimensional complex inner product space V. The reproducing kernel for the Fock space of square integrable holomorphic functions on V relative to the Gaussian measure d\mu_A(z)=\frac {\sqrt {\det A}} {\pi^n}e^{-{\rm Re}< Az,z>} dz is described in terms of the holomorphic--antiholomorphic decomposition of the linear operator A. Moreover, if A commutes with a conjugation on V, then a restriction mapping to the real vectors in V is polarized to obtain a Segal--Bargmann transform, which we also study in the Gaussian-measure setting.
