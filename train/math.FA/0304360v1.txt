Wavelet and frames have become a widely used tool in mathematics, physics, and applied science during the last decade. In this article we discuss the construction of frames for L^2(\R^n) using the action of closed subgroups H\subset \mathrm{GL}(n,\mathbb{R}) such that H has an open orbit \cO in \R^n under the action (h,\omega)\mapsto (h^{-1})^T(\omega). If H has the form ANR, where A is simply connected and abelian, N contains a co-compact discrete subgroup and R is compact containing the stabilizer group of \omega\in\cO then we construct a frame for the space L^2_{\cO}(\R^n) of L^2-functions whose Fourier transform is supported in \cO. We apply this to the case where H^T=H and the stabilizer is a symmetric subgroup, a case discussed for the continuous wavelet transform in a paper by Fabec and Olafsson.
