The \Theta-spherical functions generalize the spherical functions on Riemannian symmetric spaces and the spherical functions on non-compactly causal symmetric spaces. In this article we consider the case of even multiplicity functions. We construct a differential shift operator D_m with smooth coefficients which generates the \Theta-spherical functions from finite sums of exponential functions. We then use this fact to prove a Paley-Wiener theorem for the \Theta-spherical transfrom.
