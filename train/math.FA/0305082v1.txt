We study some questions concerning the structure of the set of spreading models of a separable infinite-dimensional Banach space X. In particular we give an example of a reflexive X so that all spreading models of X contain \ell_1 but none of them is isomorphic to \ell_1. We also prove that for any countable set C of spreading models generated by weakly null sequences there is a spreading model generated by a weakly null sequence which dominates each element of C. In certain cases this ensures that X admits, for each \alpha < \omega_1, a spreading model (\tilde x_i^\alpha)_i such that if \alpha < \beta then (\tilde x_i^\alpha)_i is dominated by (and not equivalent to) (\tilde x_i^\beta)_i. Some applications of these ideas are used to give sufficient conditions on a Banach space for the existence of a subspace and an operator defined on the subspace, which is not a compact perturbation of a multiple of the inclusion map.
