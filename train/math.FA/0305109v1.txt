We prove that the set of all integrable functions whose sequences of negative (resp. nonnegative) Fourier coefficients belong to \ell^1\cap\ell^\Phi_{\phi,w} (resp. to \ell^1\cap\ell^\Psi_{\psi,\varrho}), where \ell^\Phi_{\phi,w} and \ell^\Psi_{\psi,\varrho} are two-weighted Orlicz sequence spaces, forms an algebra under pointwise multiplication whenever the weight sequences \[ \phi=\{\phi_n\},\quad \psi=\{\psi_n\},\quad w=\{w_n\},\quad \varrho=\{\varrho_n\} \] increase and satisfy the \Delta_2-condition.
