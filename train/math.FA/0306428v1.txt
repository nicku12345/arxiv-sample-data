The purpose of this paper is to study the lower semicontinuity with respect to the strong L^1-convergence, of some integral functionals defined in the space SBD of special functions with bounded deformation. Precisely, let U be a bounded open subset of R^n. If u\in SBD(U), (u_h)\subset SBD(U) converges to u strongly in L^1(U,R^n) and the measures |E^ju_h| converge weakly * to a measure \nu singular with respect to the Lebesgue measure, then \int_Uf(x,{\mathcal E}u)dx\leq\liminf_{h\to\infty} \int_Uf(x,{\mathcal E}u_h)dx provided f satisfies some weak convexity property and the standard growth assumptions of order p>1.
