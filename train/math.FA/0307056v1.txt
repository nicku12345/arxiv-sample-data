If A is an n\times n matrix whose n eigenvalues are ordered in terms of decreasing modules, |\lambda_1 | \geq |\lambda_2| \geq ... |\lambda_n|, it is often of interest to estimate \frac{|\lambda_2|}{|\lambda_1|}. If A is a row stochastic matrix (so \lambda_1 = 1), one can use an old formula of R. L. Dobrushin to give a useful, explicit formula for |\lambda_2|. The purpose of this note is to disseminate these known results more widely and to show how they imply, as a very special case, some recent theorems of Haveliwala and Kamvar about the second eigenvalue of the Google matrix.
