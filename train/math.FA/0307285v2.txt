In this paper we obtain some statements concerning ideals of polynomials and apply these results in a number of different situations. Among other results, we present new characterizations of \mathcal{L}_{\infty}-spaces, Coincidence theorems, Dvoretzky-Rogers and Extrapolation type theorems for dominated polynomials.
