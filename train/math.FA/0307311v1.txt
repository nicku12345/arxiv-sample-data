In this paper we study absolutely summing mappings on Banach spaces by exploring the cotype of their domains and ranges. It is proved that every n% -linear mapping from \mathcal{L}_{\infty}-spaces into \mathbb{K} is % (2;2,...,2,\infty)-summing and also shown that every n-linear mapping from \mathcal{L}_{\infty}-spaces into F is (q;2,...,2)-summing whenever F has cotype q. We also give new examples of analytic summing mappings and polynomial and multilinear versions of a linear Extrapolation Theorem.
