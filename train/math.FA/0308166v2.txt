We consider convex sets and functions over idempotent semifields, like the max-plus semifield. We show that if K is a conditionally complete idempotent semifield, with completion \bar{K}, a convex function K^n\to\bar{K} which is lower semi-continuous in the order topology is the upper hull of supporting functions defined as residuated differences of affine functions. This result is proved using a separation theorem for closed convex subsets of K^n, which extends earlier results of Zimmermann, Samborski, and Shpiz.
