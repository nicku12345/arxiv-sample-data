We develop the basic theory of smooth representations of locally compact groups on bornological vector spaces. In this setup, we are able to formulate better general theorems than in the topological case. Still, smooth representations of totally disconnected groups on vector spaces and of Lie groups on Frechet spaces remain special cases of our theory. We identify smooth representations with essential modules over an appropriate convolution algebra. We examine smoothening functors on representations and modules and show that they agree if they are both defined. We establish the basic properties of induction and compact induction functors using adjoint functor techniques. We describe the center of the category of smooth representations.
