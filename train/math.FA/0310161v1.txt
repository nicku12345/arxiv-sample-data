Two Bessel sequences are orthogonal if the composition of the synthesis operator of one sequence with the analysis operator of the other sequence is the 0 operator. We characterize when two Bessel sequences are orthogonal when the Bessel sequences have the form of translates of a finite number of functions in \ltwod. The characterizations are applied to Bessel sequences which have an affine structure, and a quasi-affine structure. These also lead to characterizations of superframes. Moreover, we characterize perfect reconstruction, i.e. duality, of subspace frames for translation invariant (bandlimited) subspaces of \ltwod.
