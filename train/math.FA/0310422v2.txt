In this paper, we study a class of Banach spaces, called \phi-spaces. In a natural way, we associate a measure of weak compactness in such spaces and prove an analogue of Sadovskii fixed point theorem for weakly sequentially continuous maps. A counter-example is given to justify our requirement. As an application, we establish an existence result for a Hammerstein integral equation in a Banach space.
