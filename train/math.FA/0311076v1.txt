Given a Coxeter system of large type we prove a non--commutative central limit theorem: After normalisation with the square root of n the characteristic function of the set of the first n generators tends in distribution to Wigners semi--circle law.   If one chooses the group presentation at random, now admitting a certain amount of commutation among the generators, the distributional limit will be the q--deformed semi--circle law, 1\leq q \leq 1, almost surely.
