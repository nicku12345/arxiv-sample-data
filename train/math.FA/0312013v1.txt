We study the existence of pointwise Kadec renormings for Banach spaces of the form C(K). We show in particular that such a renorming exists when K is any product of compact linearly ordered spaces, extending the result for a single factor due to Haydon, Jayne, Namioka and Rogers. We show that if C(K_1) has a pointwise Kadec renorming and K_2 belongs to the class of spaces obtained by closing the class of compact metrizable spaces under inverse limits of transfinite continuous sequences of retractions, then C(K_1\times K_2) has a pointwise Kadec renorming. We also prove a version of the three-space property for such renormings.
