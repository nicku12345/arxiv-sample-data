In this paper we study very smooth points of Banach spaces with special emphasis on spaces of operators. We show that when the space of compact operators is an M-ideal in the space of bounded operators, a very smooth operator T attains its norm at a unique vector x (up to a constant multiple) and T(x) is a very smooth point of the range space. We show that if for every equivalent norm on a Banach space, the dual unit ball has a very smooth point then the space has the Radon--Nikod\'{y}m property. We give an example of a smooth Banach space without any very smooth points.
