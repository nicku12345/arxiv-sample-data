We give biorthogonal system characterizations of Banach spaces that fail the Dunford-Pettis property, contain an isomorphic copy of c_0, or fail the hereditary Dunford-Pettis property. We combine this with previous results to show that each infinite dimensional Banach space has one of three types of biorthogonal systems.
