Let H be a Hilbert space. Using Ball's solution of the "complex plank problem" we prove that the following properties of a sequence a_n>0 are equivalent: (1) There is a sequence x_n \in H with \|x_n\|=a_n, having 0 as a weak cluster point; (2) \sum_1^\infty a_n^{-2}=\infty. Using this result we show that a natural idea of generalization of Ball's "complex plank" result to cylinders with k-dimensional base fails already for k=3. We discuss also generalizations of "weak cluster points" result to other Banach spaces and relations with cotype.
