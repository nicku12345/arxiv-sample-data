The well known formula of B. Fuglede expresses the mean value of the Radon k-plane transform on R^n as a Riesz potential. We extend this formula to the space of n \times m real matrices and show that the corresponding matrix k-plane transform f \to \hat f is injective if and only if n-k \ge m. Different inversion formulas for this transform are obtained. We assume that f \in L^p or f is a continuous function satisfying certain "minimal" conditions at infinity.
