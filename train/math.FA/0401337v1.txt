We prove a general result on the factorization of matrix-valued analytic functions. We deduce that if (E_0,E_1) and (F_0,F_1) are interpolation pairs with dense intersections, then under some conditions on the spaces E_0, E_1, F_0 and F_1, we have  [E_0\hat\otimes F_0,E_1\hat\otimes F_1]_t= [E_0, E_1]_t\hat\otimes[F_0, F_1]_t, 0 < t< 1.   We find also conditions on the spaces E_0, E_1, F_0 and F_1, so that the following holds  [E_0\wcheck\otimes F_0,E_1\wcheck\otimes F_1]_t= [E_0,E_1]_t\wcheck\otimes [F_0,F_1]_t, 0 <t< 1.   Some applications of these results are also considered.
