We study the semi-classical trace formula at a critical energy level for a h-pseudo-differential operator on \mathbb{R}^{n} whose principal symbol has a totally degenerate critical point for that energy. We compute the contribution to the trace formula of isolated non-extremum critical points under a condition of "real principal type". The new contribution to the trace formula is valid for all time in a compact subset of \mathbb{R} but the result is modest since we have restrictions on the dimension.
