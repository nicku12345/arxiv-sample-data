In connection with the classical Schwartz kernel theorem, we show that in the framework of Colombeau generalized functions a large class of linear mappings admit integral kernels. To do this, we need to introduce news spaces of generalized functions with slow growth and the corresponding adapted linear mappings. Finally, we show that in some sense Schwartz' result is contained in our main theorem.
