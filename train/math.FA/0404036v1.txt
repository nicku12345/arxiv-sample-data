Let G(p,n) and G(q,n) be the affine Grassmann manifolds of p- and q- planes in {\mathbb R}^n, respectively, and let \mathcal{R}^{(p,q)} be the Radon transform from smooth functions on G(p,n) to smooth functions on G(q,n) arising from the inclusion incidence relation. When p<q and \dim G(p,n) = \dim G(p,n), we present a range characterization theorem for \mathcal{R}^{(p,q)} via moment conditions. We then use this range result to prove a support theorem for \mathcal{R}^{(p,q)}. This complements a previous range characterization theorem for \mathcal{R}^{(p,q)} via differential equations when \dim G(p,n) < \dim G(p,n). We also present a support theorem in this latter case.
