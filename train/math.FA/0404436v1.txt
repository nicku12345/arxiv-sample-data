Let L be an unbounded linear operator in a real Hilbert space H, a generator of C_0 semigroup, and g:H\to H be a C^2_{loc} nonlinear map. The DSM (dynamical systems method) for solving equ F(v):=Lv+gv=0 consists of solving the Cauchy problem \dot {u}=\Phi(t,u), u(0)=u_0, where \Phi is a suitable operator, and proving that i) \exists u(t) \quad \forall t>0, ii) \exists u(\infty), and iii) F(u(\infty))=0.
