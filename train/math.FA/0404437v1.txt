Consider an operator equation (*) B(u)+\ep u=0 in a real Hilbert space, where \ep>0 is a small constant. The DSM (dynamical systems method) for solving equation (*) consists of a construction of a Cauchy problem, which has the following properties:   1) it has a global solution for an arbitrary initial data, 2) this solution tends to a limit as time tends to infinity,   3) the limit solves the equation B(u)=0. Existence of the unique solution is proved by the DSM for equation (*) with monotone hemicontinuous operators B defined on all of If \ep=0 and equation (**) B(u)=0 is solvable, the DSM yields solution to (**).
