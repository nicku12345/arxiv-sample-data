In the paper "Isoperimetry of waists and local versus global asymptotic convex geometries", it was proved that the existence of nicely bounded sections of two symmetric convex bodies K and L implies that the intersection of randomly rotated K and L is nicely bounded. In this appendix, we achieve a polynomial bound on the diameter of that intersection (in the ratio of the dimensions of the sections).
