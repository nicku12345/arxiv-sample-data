The Choquet - Bishop - de Leeuw theorem states that each element of a compact convex subset of a locally convex topological Hausdorff space is a barycenter of a probability measure supported by the set of extreme points of that set. By the Edgar - Mankiewicz result this remains true for nonempty closed bounded and convex set provided it has Radon - Nikodym property. In the paper it is shown, that Choquet - type theorem holds also for "moving" sets: they are values of a certain multifunction. Namely, the existence of a suitable weak* continuous family of probability measures "almost representing" points of such sets is proven. Both compact and noncompact cases are considered. The continuous versions of the Krein - Milman theorem are obtained as corollaries.
