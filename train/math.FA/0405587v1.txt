We construct three different families of commuting pairs of subnormal operators, jointly hyponormal but not admitting commuting normal extensions. Each such family can be used to answer in the negative a 1988 conjecture of R. Curto, P. Muhly and J. Xia. We also obtain a sufficient condition under which joint hyponormality does imply joint subnormality.
