In \cite{F} J.F. Feinstein constructed a compact plane set X such that R(X) has no non-zero, bounded point derivations but is not weakly amenable. In the same paper he gave an example of a separable uniform algebra A such that every point in the character space of A is a peak point but  A is not weakly amenable. We show that it is possible to modify the construction in order to produce examples which are also regular.
