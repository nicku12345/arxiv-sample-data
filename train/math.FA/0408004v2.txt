Necessary and sufficient conditions are given for when a sequence of finite dimensional subspaces (X_n) can be blocked to be a skipped blocking decompositon (SBD). These are very similar to known results about blocking of biorthogonal sequences. A separable space X has PCP, if and only if, every norming decomposition (X_n) can be blocked to be a boundedly complete SBD. Every boundedly complete SBD is a JT-decomposition.
