Let G be a locally compact group, and let {\cal R}(G) denote the ring of subsets of G generated by the left cosets of open subsets of G. The Cohen--Host idempotent theorem asserts that a set lies in {\cal R}(G) if and only if its indicator function is a coefficient function of a unitary representation of G on some Hilbert space. We prove related results for representations of G on certain Banach spaces. We apply our Cohen--Host type theorems to the study of the Fig\`a-Talamanca--Herz algebras A_p(G) with p \in (1,\infty). For arbitrary G, we characterize those closed ideals of A_p(G) that have an approximate identity bounded by 1 in terms of their hulls. Furthermore, we characterize those G such that A_p(G) is 1-amenable for some -- and, equivalently, for all -- p \in (1,\infty): these are precisely the abelian groups.
