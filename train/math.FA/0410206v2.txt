We introduce here a generalization of the modified Bernstein polynomials for Jacobi weights using the q-Bernstein basis proposed by G.M. Phillips to generalize classical Bernstein Polynomials. The function is evaluated at points which are in geometric progression in ]0,1[. Numerous properties of the modified Bernstein Polynomials are extended to their q-analogues: simultaneous approximation, pointwise convergence even for unbounded functions, shape-preserving property, Voronovskaya theorem, self-adjointness. Some properties of the eigenvectors, which are q-extensions of Jacobi polynomials, are given.
