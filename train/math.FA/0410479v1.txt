Let F:X\to X be a C^2_\loc map in a Banach space X, and A be its Fr\`echet derivative at the element w:=w_\ve, which solves the problem (\ast) \dotw=-A^{-1}_\ve(F(w)+\ve w), w(0)=w_0, where A_\ve:=A+\ve I. Assume that \|A^{-1}_\ve\|\leq c \ve^{-k}, 0<k\leq 1, 0<\ve>\ve_0. Then (\ast) has a unique global solution, w(t), there exists w(\infty), and (\ast\ast) F(w(\infty))+\ve w(\infty)=0. Thus the DSM (Dynamical Systems Method) is justified for equation (\ast\ast). The limit of w_\ve as \ve\to 0 is studied.
