This paper is concerned with the characterization of \alpha-modulation spaces by Banach frames, i.e., stable and redundant non-orthogonal expansions, constituted of functions obtained by a suitable combination of translation, modulation and dilation of a mother atom. In particular, the parameter \alpha \in [0,1] governs the dependence of the dilation factor on the frequency. The result is achieved by exploiting intrinsic properties of localization of such frames. The well-known Gabor and wavelet frames arise as special cases (\alpha = 0) and limiting case ( \alpha \to 1), to characterize respectively modulation and Besov spaces. This intermediate theory contributes to a further answer to the theoretical need of a common interpretation and framework between Gabor and wavelet theory and to the construction of new tools for applications in time-frequency analysis, signal processing, and numerical analysis.
