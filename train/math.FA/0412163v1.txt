We suggest a new version of the notion of \rho-dilation (\rho>0) of an N-tuple \mathbf{A}=(A_1,...,A_N) of bounded linear operators on a common Hilbert space. We say that \mathbf{A} belongs to the class C_{\rho,N} if \mathbf{A} admits a \rho-dilation \widetilde{\mathbf{A}}=(\widetilde{A}_1,...,\widetilde{A}_N) for which \zeta\widetilde{\mathbf{A}}:=\zeta_1\widetilde{A}_1+... +\zeta_N\widetilde{A}_N is a unitary operator for each \zeta:=(\zeta_1,...,\zeta_N) in the unit torus \mathbb{T}^N. For N=1 this class coincides with the class C_\rho of B. Sz.-Nagy and C. Foia\c{s}. We generalize the known descriptions of C_{\rho,1}=C_\rho to the case of C_{\rho,N}, N>1, using so-called Agler kernels. Also, the notion of operator radii w_\rho, \rho>0, is generalized to the case of N-tuples of operators, and to the case of bounded (in a certain strong sense) holomorphic operator-valued functions in the open unit polydisk \mathbb{D}^N, with preservation of all the most important their properties. Finally, we show that for each \rho>1 and N>1 there exists an \mathbf{A}=(A_1,...,A_N)\in C_{\rho,N} which is not simultaneously similar to any \mathbf{T}=(T_1,...,T_N)\in C_{1,N}, however if \mathbf{A}\in C_{\rho,N} admits a uniform unitary \rho-dilation then \mathbf{A} is simultaneously similar to some \mathbf{T}\in C_{1,N}.
