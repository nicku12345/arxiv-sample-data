We generalize our earlier results from \cite{K} on the Bessmertny\u{\i} class of operator-valued functions holomorphic in the open right poly-halfplane which admit representation as a Schur complement of a block of a linear homogeneous operator-valued function with positive semidefinite operator coefficients, to the case of a product of open right matrix halfplanes. Several equivalent characterizations of this generalized Bessmertny\u{\i} class are presented. In particular, its intimate connection with the Agler--Schur class of holomorphic contractive operator-valued functions on the product of matrix unit disks is established.
