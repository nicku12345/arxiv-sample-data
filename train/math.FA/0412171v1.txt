We give sufficient conditions on a Banach space X which ensure that \ell_{\infty} embeds in \mathcal{L}(X), the space of all operators on X. We say that a basic sequence (e_n) is quasisubsymmetric if for any two increasing sequences (k_n) and (\ell_n) of positive integers with k_n \leq \ell_n for all n, we have that (e_{k_n}) dominates (e_{\ell_n}). We prove that if a Banach space X has a seminormalized quasisubsymmetric basis then \ell_{\infty} embeds in \mathcal{L}(X).
