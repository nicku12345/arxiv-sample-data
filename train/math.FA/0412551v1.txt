We prove the following version of the Kreps-Yan theorem. For any norm closed convex cone C\subset L^\infty such that C\cap L_+^\infty=\{0\} and C\supset -L_+^\infty, there exists a strictly positive continuous linear functional, whose restriction on C is non-positive. The proof uses some tools from convex analysis in contrast to the case of a weakly Lindel\"of Banach space, where such approach is not needed.
