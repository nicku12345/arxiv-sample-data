In this paper, the generalized Hyers--Ulam--Rassias stability of (\sigma-\tau)-derivations on normed algebras into Banach bimodules is established. We introduce the notion of approximate (\sigma-\tau)-contractibility and prove that a Banach algebra is (\sigma-\tau)-contractible if and only if it is approximately (\sigma-\tau)-Contractible.
