In this work we shall be concerned with some stability aspects of the classical problem of extension of C(K)-valued operators. We introduce the class \mathscr{LP} of Banach spaces of Lindenstrauss-Pe{\l}czy\'{n}ski type as those such that every operator from a subspace of c_0 into them can be extended to c_0. We show that all \mathscr{LP}-spaces are of type \mathcal L_\infty but not the converse. Moreover, \mathcal L_\infty-spaces will be characterized as those spaces E such that E-valued operators from w^*(l_1,c_0)-closed subspaces of l_1 extend to l_1. Complemented subspaces of C(K) and separably injective spaces are subclasses of \mathscr{LP}-spaces and we show that the former does not contain the latter. It is established that \mathcal L_\infty-spaces not containing l_1 are quotients of \mathscr{LP}-spaces, while \mathcal L_\infty-spaces not containing c_0, quotients of an \mathscr{LP}-space by a separably injective space and twisted sums of \mathscr{LP}-spaces are \mathscr{LP}-spaces.
