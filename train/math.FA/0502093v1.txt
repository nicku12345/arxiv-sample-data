The family of harmonic Hilbert spaces is a natural enlargement of those classical L^{2}-Sobolev space on \R^d which consist of continuous functions. In the present paper we demonstrate that the use of basic results from the theory of Wiener amalgam spaces allows to establish fundamental properties of harmonic Hilbert spaces even if they are defined over an arbitrary locally compact abelian group \G. Even for \G = \R^{d} this new approach improves previously known results. In this paper we present results on minimal norm interpolators over lattices and show that the infinite minimal norm interpolations are the limits of finite minimal norm interpolations. In addition, the new approach paves the way for the study of stability problems and error analysis for norm interpolations in harmonic Hilbert and Banach spaces on locally compact abelian groups.
