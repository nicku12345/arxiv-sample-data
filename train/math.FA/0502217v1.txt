In this paper we construct frames of Gabor type for the space L^2_{rad}(\R^d) of radial L^2-functions, and more generally, for subspaces of modulation spaces consisting of radial distributions. Hereby, each frame element itself is a radial function. This construction is based on a generalization of the so called Feichtinger-Gr\"ochenig theory -- sometimes also called coorbit space theory -- which was developed in an earlier article. We show that this new type of Gabor frames behaves better in linear and non-linear approximation in a certain sense than usual Gabor frames when approximating a radial function. Moreover, we derive new embedding theorems for coorbit spaces restricted to invariant vectors (functions) and apply them to modulation spaces of radial distributions. As a special case this result implies that the Feichtinger algebra (S_0)_{rad}(\R^d) = M^1_{rad}(\R^d) restricted to radial functions is embedded into the Sobolev space H^{(d-1)/2}_{rad}(\R^d). Moreover, for d\geq 2 the embedding (S_0)_{rad}(\R^d) \hookrightarrow L^2_{rad}(\R^d) is compact.
