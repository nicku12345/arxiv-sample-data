For a bounded function f from the unit sphere of a closed subspace X of a Banach space Y, we study when the closed convex hull of its spatial numerical range W(f) is equal to its intrinsic numerical range V(f). We show that for every infinite-dimensional Banach space X there is a superspace Y and a bounded linear operator T:X\longrightarrow Y such that \bar{co} W(T)\neq V(T). We also show that, up to renormig, for every non-reflexive Banach space Y, one can find a closed subspace X and a bounded linear operator T\in L(X,Y) such that \bar{co} W(T)\neq V(T).   Finally, we introduce a sufficient condition for the closed convex hull of the spatial numerical range to be equal to the intrinsic numerical range, which we call the Bishop-Phelps-Bollobas property, and which is weaker than the uniform smoothness and the finite-dimensionality. We characterize strong subdifferentiability and uniform smoothness in terms of this property.
