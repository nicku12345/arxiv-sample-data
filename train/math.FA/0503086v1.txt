Chmieli\'{n}ski has proved in the paper [4] the superstability of the generalized orthogonality equation |< f(x), f(y) >| = |< x, y >|. In this paper, we will extend the result of Chmieli\'{n}ski by proving a theorem: Let D_{n} be a suitable subset of  \R^n. If a function f\hbox{:} D_{n} \to \R^n satisfies the inequality ||< f(x), f(y) >| - |< x, y >|| \leq \phi(x,y) for an appropriate control function \phi(x,y) and for all x, y \in D_{n}, then f satisfies the generalized orthogonality equation for any x, y \in D_{n}.
