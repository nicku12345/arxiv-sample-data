We introduce two notions of amenability for a Banach algebra \cal A. Let I be a closed two-sided ideal in \cal A, we say \cal A is I-weakly amenable if the first cohomology group of \cal A with coefficients in the dual space I^* is zero; i.e., H^1({\cal A},I^*)=\{0\}, and, \cal A is ideally amenable if \cal A is I-weakly amenable for every closed two-sided ideal I in \cal A. We relate these concepts to weak amenability of Banach algebras. We also show that ideal amenability is different from amenability and weak amenability. We study the I-weak amenability of a Banach algebra \cal A for some special closed two-sided\break ideal I.
