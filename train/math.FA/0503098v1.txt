Let G be a locally compact group with a fixed right Haar measure and X a separable Banach space. Let L^p(G,X) be the space of X-valued measurable functions whose norm-functions are in the usual L^{p}. A left multiplier of L^p(G,X) is a bounded linear operator on  L^p(G,X) which commutes with all left translations. We use the characterization of isometries of L^p(G,X) onto itself to characterize the isometric, invertible, left multipliers of L^p(G,X) for 1\leq p <\infty, p\neq 2, under the assumption that X is not the \ell^p-direct sum of two non-zero subspaces. In fact we prove that if T is an isometric left multiplier of L^p(G,X) onto itself then there exists a y \in G and an isometry U of X onto itself such that Tf(x)= U(R_yf)(x). As an application, we determine the isometric left multipliers of L^1 \bigcap L^p (G,X) and L^1 \bigcap C_0 (G,X) where G is non-compact and X is not the \ell^p-direct sum of two non-zero subspaces. If G is a locally compact abelian group and H is a separable Hilbert space, we define A^p (G,H) = \{f\in L^1(G,H)\hbox{:} \hat{f}\in L^p(\Gamma,H)\} where \Gamma is the dual group of G. We characterize the isometric, invertible, left multipliers of A^p (G,H), provided G is non-compact. Finally, we use the characterization of isometries of C(G,X) for G compact to determine the isometric left multipliers of C(G,X) provided X^* is strictly convex.
