As in Hokusai's series of paintings "Thirty six views of mount Fuji" in which mount Fuji's is sometimes scarcely visible, the central topic of this paper is the geometry of K-spaces although in some of the seven views presented K-spaces are not easily visible. We study the interplay between the behaviour of approximately convex (and approximately affine) functions on the unit ball of a Banach space and the geometry of Banach K-spaces.
