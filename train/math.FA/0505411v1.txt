For a given element f\in L^1 and a convex cone C\subset L^\infty, C\cap L^\infty_+=\{0\} we give necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of an element g\ge f lying in the polar of C. This polar is taken in (L^\infty)^* and in L^1. In the context of mathematical finance the main result concerns the existence of martingale measures, whose densities are bounded from below by prescribed random variable.
