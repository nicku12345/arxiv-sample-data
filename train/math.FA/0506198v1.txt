Refining some results of S. S. Dragomir, several new reverses of the generalized triangle inequality in inner product spaces are given. Among several results, we establish some reverses for the Schwarz inequality. In particular, it is proved that if a is a unit vector in a real or complex inner product space (H;< .,.>), r, s>0, p\in(0,s], D=\{x\in H,\|rx-sa\|\leq p\}, x_1, x_2\in D-\{0\} and  \alpha_{r,s}=\min\{\frac{r^2\|x_k\|^2-p^2+s^2}{2rs\|x_k\|}: 1\leq k\leq 2 \}, then \frac{\|x_1\|\|x_2\|-Re< x_1,x_2>}{(\|x_1\|+\|x_2\|)^2}\leq \alpha_{r,s}.
