The method of compatible sequences is introduced in order to produce non-trivial (closed) invariant subspaces of (bounded linear) operators. Also a topological tool is used which is new in the search of invariant subspaces: the extraction of continuous selections of lower semicontinuous set valued functions. The advantage of this method over previously known methods is that if an operator acts on a reflexive Banach space then it has a non-trivial invariant subspace if and only if there exist compatible sequences (their definition refers to a fixed operator). Using compatible sequences a result of Aronszajn-Smith is proved for reflexive Banach spaces. Also it is shown that if X be a reflexive Banach space, T \in {\mathcal L} (X), and A is any closed ball of X, then either there exists v \in A such that Tv=0, or there exists v \in A such that \bar{\text{Span}} \text{Orb}_T (Tv) is a non-trivial invariant subspace of T, or A \subseteq \bar{\text{Span}} \{T^k x_{\ell} : \ell \in {\mathbb N}, 1 \leq k \leq \ell \}  for every (x_n)_n \in A^{\mathbb N}.
