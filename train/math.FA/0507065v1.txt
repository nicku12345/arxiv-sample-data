In this paper we explore finite rank perturbations of unilateral weighted shifts W_\alpha. First, we prove that the subnormality of W_\alpha is never stable under nonzero finite rank pertrubations unless the perturbation occurs at the zeroth weight. Second, we establish that 2-hyponormality implies positive quadratic hyponormality, in the sense that the Maclaurin coefficients of D_n(s):=\text{det} P_n [(W_\alpha+sW_\alpha^2)^*, W_\alpha+s W_\alpha^2] P_n are nonnegative, for every n\ge 0, where P_n denotes the orthogonal projection onto the basis vectors \{e_0,...,e_n\}. Finally, for \alpha strictly increasing and W_\alpha 2-hyponormal, we show that for a small finite-rank perturbation \alpha^\prime of \alpha, the shift W_{\alpha^\prime} remains quadratically hyponormal.
