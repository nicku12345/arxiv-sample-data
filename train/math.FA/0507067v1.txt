Let \beta\equiv\beta^{(2n)} be an N-dimensional real multi-sequence of degree 2n, with associated moment matrix \mathcal{M}(n)\equiv \mathcal{M}(n)(\beta), and let r:=rank \mathcal{M}(n). We prove that if \mathcal{M}(n) is positive semidefinite and admits a rank-preserving moment matrix extension \mathcal{M}(n+1), then \mathcal{M}(n+1) has a unique representing measure \mu, which is r-atomic, with supp \mu equal to \mathcal{V}(\mathcal{M}(n+1)), the algebraic variety of \mathcal{M}(n+1). Further, \beta has an r-atomic (minimal) representing measure supported in a semi-algebraic set K_{\mathcal{Q}} subordinate to a family \mathcal{Q}% \equiv\{q_{i}\}_{i=1}^{m}\subseteq\mathbb{R}[t_{1},...,t_{N}] if and only if \mathcal{M}(n) is positive semidefinite and admits a rank-preserving extension \mathcal{M}(n+1) for which the associated localizing matrices \mathcal{M}_{q_{i}}(n+[\frac{1+\deg q_{i}}{2}]) are positive semidefinite (1\leq i\leq m); in this case, \mu (as above) satisfies supp \mu\subseteq K_{\mathcal{Q}}, and \mu has precisely rank \mathcal{M}(n)-rank \mathcal{M}_{q_{i}}(n+[\frac{1+\deg q_{i}}{2}]) atoms in \mathcal{Z}(q_{i})\equiv {t\in\mathbb{R}^{N}:q_{i}(t)=0}, 1\leq i\leq m.
