Let Q(x,y)=0 be an hyperbola in the plane. Given real numbers \beta \equiv\beta^{2n)}=\{\beta_{ij}\}_{i,j\geq0,i+j\leq2n}, with \beta_{00}>0, the truncated Q-hyperbolic moment problem for \beta entails finding necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of a positive Borel measure \mu, supported in Q(x,y)=0, such that \beta_{ij}=\int y^{i}x^{j} d\mu (0\leq i+j\leq2n). We prove that \beta admits a Q-representing measure \mu (as above) if and only if the associated moment matrix \mathcal{M}(n)(\beta) is positive semidefinite, recursively generated, has a column relation Q(X,Y)=0, and the algebraic variety \mathcal{V}(\beta) associated to \beta satisfies card\mathcal{V}(\beta)\geq\rank\mathcal{M}(n)(\beta). In this case, rank\mathcal{M}(n)\leq2n+1; if rank\mathcal{M}(n)\leq2n, then \beta admits a rank\mathcal{M}(n)-atomic (minimal) Q-representing measure; if rank\mathcal{M}(n)=2n+1, then \beta admits a Q-representing measure \mu satisfying 2n+1\leqcard supp\mu\leq2n+2.
