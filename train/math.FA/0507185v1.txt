Let a, b be two fixed positive constants. A function g\in L^2({\mathbb R}) is called a \textit{mother Weyl-Heisenberg frame wavelet} for (a,b) if g generates a frame for L^2({\mathbb R}) under modulates by b and translates by a, i.e., \{e^{imbt}g(t-na\}_{m,n\in\mathbb{Z}} is a frame for L^2(\mathbb{R}). In this paper, we establish a connection between mother Weyl-Heisenberg frame wavelets of certain special forms and certain strongly positive definite quadratic forms of infinite dimension. Some examples of application in matrix algebra are provided.
