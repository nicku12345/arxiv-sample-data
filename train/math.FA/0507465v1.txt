We generalize the theory of Wiener amalgam spaces on locally compact groups to quasi-Banach spaces. As a main result we provide convolution relations for such spaces. Also we weaken the technical assumption that the global component is invariant under right translations, which is even new for the classical Banach space case. To illustrate our theory we discuss in detail an example on the ax+b group.
