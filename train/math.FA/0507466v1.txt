We generalize the classical coorbit space theory developed by Feichtinger and Gr"ochenig to quasi-Banach spaces. As a main result we provide atomic decompositions for coorbit spaces defined with respect to quasi-Banach spaces. These atomic decompositions are used to prove fast convergence rates of best n-term approximation schemes. We apply the abstract theory to time-frequency analysis of modulation spaces M^{p,q}_m, 0< p,q \leq \infty.
