The purpose of this note is to describe some algebraic conditions on a Banach algebra which force it to be finite dimensional. One of the main results in Theorem~2 which states that for a locally compact group G, G is compact if there exists a measure \mu in \hbox{Soc}(L^{1}(G)) such that \mu(G) \neq 0. We also prove that G is finite if \hbox{Soc}(M(G)) is closed and every nonzero left ideal in M(G) contains a minimal left ideal.
