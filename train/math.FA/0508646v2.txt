Let \mathcal H be a Hilbert space. Given a bounded positive definite operator S on \mathcal H, and a bounded sequence \mathbf{c} = \{c_k \}_{k \in \mathbb N} of non negative real numbers, the pair (S, \mathbf{c}) is frame admissible, if there exists a frame \{f_k \}_{k \in \mathbb{N}}  on \mathcal H with frame operator S, such that \|f_k \|^2 = c_k, k \in \mathbb {N}. We relate the existence of such frames with the Schur-Horn theorem of majorization, and give a reformulation of the extended version of Schur-Horn theorem, due to A. Neumann. We use it to get necessary conditions (and to generalize known sufficient conditions) for a pair (S, \mathbf{c}), to be frame admissible.
