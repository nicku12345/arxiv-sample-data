For orthogonal polynomials defined by compact Jacobi matrix with exponential decay of the coefficients, precise properties of orthogonality measure is determined. This allows showing uniform boundedness of partial sums of orthogonal expansions with respect to L^\infty norm, which generalize analogous results obtained for little q-Legendre, little q-Jacobi and little q-Laguerre polynomials, by the authors.
