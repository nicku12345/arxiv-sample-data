If \H is a Hilbert space, A is a positive bounded linear operator on \cH and \cS is a closed subspace of \cH, the relative position between \cS and A^{-1}(\cS \orto) establishes a notion of compatibility. We show that the compatibility of (A,\cS) is equivalent to the existence of a convenient orthogonal projection in the operator range R(A^{1/2}) with its canonical Hilbertian structure.
