J. Elton proved that every normalized weakly null sequence in a Banach space admits a subsequence that is nearly unconditional which is a weak form of unconditionality. The notion of near-unconditionality is quantified by a constant K(\delta) depending on a parameter \delta \in (0,1]. It is unknown if \sup_{\delta>0} K(\delta) < \infty. This problem turns out to be closely related to the question whether every infinite-dimensional Banach space contains a quasi-greedy basic sequence. The notion of a quasi-greedy basic sequence was introduced recently by S. V. Konyagin and V. N. Temlyakov. We present an extension of Elton's result which includes Schreier unconditionality. The proof involves a basic framework which we show can be also employed to prove other partial unconditionality results including that of convex unconditionality due to Argyros, Mercourakis and Tsarpalias. Various constants of partial unconditionality are defined and we investigate the relationships between them. We also explore the combinatorial problem underlying the \sup_{\delta>0} K(\delta) < \infty problem and show that \sup_{\delta>0} K(\delta) > 5/4.
