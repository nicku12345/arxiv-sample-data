We consider 1-complemented subspaces (ranges of contractive projections) of vector-valued spaces \ell_p(X), where X is a Banach space with a 1-unconditional basis and p \in (1,2)\cup (2,\infty). If the norm of X is twice continuously differentiable and satisfies certain conditions connecting the norm and the notion of disjointness with respect to the basis, then we prove that every 1-complemented subspace of \ell_p(X) admits a basis of mutually disjoint elements. Moreover, we show that every contractive projection is then an averaging operator. We apply our results to the space \ell_p(\ell_q) with p,q\in (1,2)\cup (2,\infty) and obtain a complete characterization of its 1-complemented subspaces.
