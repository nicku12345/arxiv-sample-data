A factorization theory is proposed for Wiener-Hopf plus Hankel operators with almost periodic Fourier symbols. We introduce a factorization concept for the almost periodic Fourier symbols such that the properties of the factors will allow corresponding operator factorizations. Conditions for left, right, or both-sided invertibility of the Wiener-Hopf plus Hankel operators are therefore obtained upon certain indices of the factorizations. Under such conditions, the one-sided and two-sided inverses of the operators in study are also obtained.
