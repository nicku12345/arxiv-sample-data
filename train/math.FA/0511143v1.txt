We define an affine structure on \ltwor\oplus...\oplus\ltwor and, following some ideas developed in \cite{Dut1}, we construct a local trace function for this situation. This trace function is a complete invariant for a shift invariant subspace and it has a variety of properties which make it easily computable. The local trace is then used to give a characterization of super-wavelets and to analyze their multiplicity function, dimension function and spectral function. The "n\times" oversampling result of Chui and Shi \cite{CS} is refined to produce super-wavelets.
