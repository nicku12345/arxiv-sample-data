This paper contains results concerning the Borel reduction of the relation E_0 of eventual agreement between sequences of 0's and 1's, to the relation of permutative equivalence between basic sequences in a Banach space. For more clarity in this abstract, we state these results in terms of classification by real numbers.   If R is some (analytic) equivalence relation on a Polish space X, it is said that R is classifiable (by real numbers) if there exists a Borel map g from X into the real line such that x R x' if and only if g(x)=g(x'). If R is not classifiable, there must be 2^{\omega} R-classes. It is conjectured that any separable Banach space such that isomorphism between its subspaces is classifiable must be isomorphic to l_2.   We prove the following results:   - the relation \sim^{perm} of permutative equivalence between normalized basic sequences is analytic non Borel,   - if X is a Banach space with a Schauder basis (e_n), such that \sim^{perm} between normalized block-sequences of X is classifiable, then X is c_0 or \ell_p saturated for some 1 \leq p <+\infty,   - if (e_n) is shrinking unconditional, and \sim^{perm} between normalized disjointly supported sequences in X, resp. in X^*, are classifiable, then (e_n) is equivalent to the unit vector basis of c_0 or \ell_p,   - if (e_n) is unconditional, then either X is isomorphic to l_2, or X contains 2^{\omega} subspaces or 2^{\omega} quotients which are spanned by pairwise non permutatively equivalent normalized unconditional bases.
