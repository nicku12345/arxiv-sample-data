By iterative techniques,we present two fixed point theorems, whose modular formulations are relatively close to the Banach's fixed point theorem in the normed spaces.The first result concerns the fixed point of the strongly contraction mappings.The second result deals with the fixed point of the strict contraction mappings where the modular satisfies the delta-condition.   For the nonexpansive mappings,where the modular satisfies the regular growth condition,we present a fixed point theorem of the Shauder's type,without boundedness condition on the domain of theses mappings.
