We prove new estimates of the K-divisibility constants for some special Banach couples. In particular, we prove that the K-divisibility constant for a couple of the form (U\oplus V, U) where U and V are non-trivial Hilbert spaces equals 2/\sqrt{3}. We also prove estimates for the K-divisibility constant of the two-dimensional version of the couple (L_2,L_\infty), proving in particular that this couple is not exactly K-divisible. There are also several auxiliary results, including some estimates for relative Calder\'on constants for finite dimensional couples.
