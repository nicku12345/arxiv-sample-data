We denote by \bbt the unit circle and by \bbd the unit disc of \bbc. Let s be a non-negative real and \omega a weight such that \omega(n) = (1+n)^{s} \quad (n \geq 0) and such that the sequence \dsp \Big(\frac{\omega(-n)}{(1+n)^{s}} \Big)_{n \geq 0} is non-decreasing. We define the Banach algebra  A_{\omega}(\bbt) = \Big\{f \in \calc(\bbt) : \big\| f \big\|_{\omega} = \sum_{n = -\infty}^{+\infty} | \hat{f}(n) | \omega(n) < +\infty \Big\},  If I is a closed ideal of A_{\omega}(\bbt), we set h^{0}(I) = \Big\{z \in \bbt : f(z) = 0 \quad (f \in I) \Big\}. We describe here all closed ideals I of A_{\omega}(\bbt) such that h^{0}(I) is at most countable. A similar result is obtained for closed ideals of the algebra A_{s}^{+}(\bbt) = \Big\{f \in A_{\omega}(\bbt) : \hat{f}(n) = 0 \quad (n<0) \Big\} without inner factor. Then, we use this description to establish a link between operators with countable spectrum and interpolating sets for \textrm{{\LARGE a}}^{\infty}, the space of infinitely differentiable functions in the closed unit disc \bar{\bbd} and holomorphic in \bbd.
