In this work we investigate semigroups of operators acting on noncommutative L^p-spaces. We introduce noncommutative square functions and their connection to sectoriality, variants of Rademacher sectoriality, and H^\infty functional calculus. We discuss several examples of noncommutative diffusion semigroups. This includes Schur multipliers, q-Ornstein-Uhlenbeck semigroups, and the noncommutative Poisson semigroup on free groups.
