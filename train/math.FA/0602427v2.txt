Let H be a Hilbert space and E a Banach space. In this note we present a sufficient condition for an operator R: H\to E to be \gamma--radonifying in terms of Riesz sequences in H. This result is applied to recover a result of Lutz Weis and the second named author on the R-boundedness of resolvents, which is used to obtain a Datko-Pazy type theorem for the stochastic Cauchy problem. We also present some perturbation results.
