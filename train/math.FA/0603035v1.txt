In analogy to the classical isomorphism between \mathcal{L}(\mathcal{S}(\mathbb{R}^{n}) ,\mathcal{S}^{\prime}(\mathbb{R}^{m}) )  and \mathcal{S}^{\prime}(\mathbb{R}^{n+m}) , we show that a large class of moderate linear mappings acting between the space \mathcal{G}\_{\mathcal{S}}(\mathbb{R}^{n})  of Colombeau rapidly decreasing generalized functions and the space \mathcal{G}\_{\tau}(\mathbb{R}^{n})  of temperate ones admits generalized integral representations, with kernels belonging to \mathcal{G}\_{\tau}(\mathbb{R}^{n+m}) . Furthermore, this result contains the classical one in the sense of the generalized distribution equality.
