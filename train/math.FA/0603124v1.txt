We characterize projective and injective Banach modules in approximate terms, generalizing thereby a characterization of contractible Banach algebras given by F. Ghahramani and R. J. Loy. As a corollary, we show that each uniformly approximately amenable Banach algebra is amenable. Some applications to homological dimensions of Banach modules and algebras are also given.
