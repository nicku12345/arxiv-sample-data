A Banach space X has the Daugavet property if the Daugavet equation \|\Id + T\|= 1 + \|T\| holds for every rank-one operator T:X \longrightarrow X. We show that the most natural attempts to introduce new properties by considering other norm equalities for operators (like \|g(T)\|=f(\|T\|) for some functions f and g) lead in fact to the Daugavet property of the space. On the other hand there are equations (for example \|\Id + T\|= \|\Id - T\|) that lead to new, strictly weaker properties of Banach spaces.
