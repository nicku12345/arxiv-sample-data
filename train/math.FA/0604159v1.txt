Let X be a real or complex Banach space and T_t:X\to X is a power bounded operator (or a C_0-semigroup). If there exists a "occasionally" attracting compact subset K (for each x in unit ball \liminf_n \rho(T^n x, K)=0 then there exists attracting finite-dimensional subspace L (for each x in X \lim_n \rho(T^n x, L)=0. Also we define the compact-supercyclicity. Each infinity-dimentional X has no compact-supercyclic isometries. If T is a supercyclic and power bounded that T^nx vanishes for each x.
