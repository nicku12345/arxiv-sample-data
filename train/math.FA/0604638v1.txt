We consider two classes of actions on \mathbb{R}^n - one continuous and one discrete. For matrices of the form A = e^B with B \in M_n(\R), we consider the action given by \gamma \to \gamma A^t. We characterize the matrices A for which there is a cross-section for this action. The discrete action we consider is given by \gamma \to \gamma A^k, where A\in GL_n(\R). We characterize the matrices A for which there exists a cross-section for this action as well. We also characterize those A for which there exist special types of cross-sections; namely, bounded cross-sections and finite measure cross-sections. Explicit examples of cross-sections are provided for each of the cases in which cross-sections exist. Finally, these explicit cross-sections are used to characterize those matrices for which there exist MSF wavelets with infinitely many wavelet functions. Along the way, we generalize a well-known aspect of the theory of shift-invariant spaces to shift-invariant spaces with infinitely many generators.
