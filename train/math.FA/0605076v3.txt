The solution of a problem arising in integrable systems requires sharp asymptotics for the inverses and determinants of truncated Wiener-Hopf operators, both in the regular case (where the non-truncated Wiener-Hopf operator is invertible) and in singular cases. This paper treats the singular cases where the symbol of the Wiener-Hopf operator has one double zero or two simple zeros. We find formulas for the inverses that hold uniformly throughout the underlying interval with very small error, and formulas for the determinants with very small error.
