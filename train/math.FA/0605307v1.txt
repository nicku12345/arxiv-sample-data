In this paper we give a simple proof of inequalities of integrals of functions which are the composition of nonnegative continous convex functions on a vector space {\bf R}^m and vector-valued functions in a weakly compact subset of a Banach vector space generated by m L_\mu^p-spaces for 1\leq p<+\infty. Also, the same inequalities hold if these vector-valued functions are in a weakly* compact subset of a Banach vector space generated by m L_\mu^\infty-spaces instead.
