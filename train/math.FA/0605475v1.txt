We show that the classes of separable reflexive Banach spaces and of spaces with separable dual are strongly bounded. This gives a new proof of a recent result of E. Odell and Th. Schlumprecht, asserting that there exists a separable reflexive Banach space containing isomorphic copies of every separable uniformly convex Banach spaces.
