Let \Gamma be a discrete group and let f \in \ell^1(\Gamma). We observe that if the natural convolution operator \rho_f:\ell^{\infty}(\Gamma)\to \ell^{\inf ty}(\Gamma) is injective, then f is invertible in \ell^1(\Gamma). Our proof simplifies and generalizes calculations in a preprint of Deninger and Schmidt, by appealing to the direct finiteness of the algebra \ell^1(\Gamma). We give simple examples to show that in general one cannot replace \ell^{\infty} with \ell^p, 1\leq p< \infty, nor with L^{\infty}(G) for nondiscrete G. Finally, we consider the problem of extending the main result to the case of weighted convolution operators on \Gamma, and give some partial results.
