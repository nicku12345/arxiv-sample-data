We present closed graph and open mapping theorems for \wt{\C}-linear maps acting between suitable classes of topological and locally convex topological \wt{\C}-modules. This is done by adaptation of De Wilde's theory of webbed spaces and Adasch's theory of barrelled spaces to the context of locally convex and topological \wt{\C}-modules respectively. We give applications of the previous theorems to Colombeau theory as well to the theory of Banach \wt{\C}-modules. In particular we obtain a necessary condition for \Ginf-hypoellipticity on the symbol of a partial differential operator with generalized constant coefficients.
