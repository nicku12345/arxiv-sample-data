We investigate the boundedness of unimodular Fourier multipliers on modulation spaces. Surprisingly, the multipliers with general symbol e^{i|\xi|^\alpha}, where \alpha\in[0, 2], are bounded on all modulation spaces, but, in general, fail to be bounded on the usual L^p-spaces. As a consequence, the phase-space concentration of the solutions to the free Schr\"odinger and wave equations are preserved. As a byproduct, we also obtain boundedness results on modulation spaces for singular multipliers |\xi|^{-\delta} \sin (|\xi|^\alpha) for  0 \leq \delta \leq \alpha .
