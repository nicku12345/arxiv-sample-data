The Trudinger-Moser inequality states that for functions u \in H_0^{1,n}(\Omega) (\Omega \subset \mathbb R^n a bounded domain) with \int_\Omega |\nabla u|^ndx \le 1 one has \int_\Omega (e^{\alpha_n|u|^{\frac n{n-1}}}-1)dx \le c |\Omega|, with c independent of u. Recently, the second author has shown that for n = 2 the bound c |\Omega|  may be replaced by a uniform constant d independent of \Omega if the Dirichlet norm is replaced by the Sobolev norm, i.e. requiring \int_\Omega (|\nabla u|^n + |u|^n)dx \le 1. We extend here this result to arbitrary dimensions n > 2. Also, we prove that for \Omega = \mathbb R^n the supremum of \int_{\mathbb R^n} (e^{\alpha_n|u|^{\frac n{n-1}}}-1)dx over all such functions is attained. The proof is based on a blow-up procedure.
