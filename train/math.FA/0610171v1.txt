We introduce two notions of amenability for a Banach algebra \cal A. Let n\in \Bbb N and let I be a closed two-sided ideal in \cal A, \cal A is n-I-weakly amenable if the first cohomology group of \cal A with coefficients in the n-th dual space I^{(n)} is zero; i.e., H^1({\cal A},I^{(n)})=\{0\}. Further, \cal A is n-ideally amenable if \cal A is n-I-weakly amenable for every closed two-sided ideal I in \cal A. We find some relationships of n-I- weak amenability and m-J- weak amenability for some different m and n or for different closed ideals I and J of \cal A.
