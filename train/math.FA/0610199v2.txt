Let X be a left introverted subspace of dual of a Banach algebra. We study Z_t(X^*), the topological center of Banach algebra X^*. We fined the topological center of (X\cA)^*, when \cA has a bounded right approximate identity and \cA\subseteq X^*. So we introduce a new notation of amenability for a dual Banach algebra \cal A. A dual Banach algebra \cal A is weakly Connes-amenable if the first weak^*-continuous cohomology group of \cal A with coefficients in \cal A is zero; i.e., H^1_{w^*}(\cal A, \cal A)=\{o\}. We study the weak Connes-amenability of some dual Banach algebras.
