We investigate composition operators on Hardy-Orlicz spaces when the Orlicz function \Psi grows rapidly: compactness, weak compactness, to be p-summing, order bounded,..., and show how these notions behave according to the growth of \Psi. We introduce an adapted version of Carleson measure. We construct various examples showing that our results are essentially sharp. In the last part, we study the case of Bergman-Orlicz spaces.
