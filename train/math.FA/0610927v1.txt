Let G_{n,k}(\bbK) be the   Grassmannian manifold of k-dimensional \bbK-subspaces in \bbK^n where \bbK=\mathbb R, \mathbb C, \mathbb H is the field of real, complex or quaternionic numbers.   For 1\le k < k^\prime \le n-1 we define the Radon transform (\mathcal R f)(\eta), \eta \in G_{n,k^\prime}(\bbK), for functions f(\xi) on G_{n,k}(\bbK) as an integration over all \xi \subset \eta. When k+k^\prime \le n we give an inversion formula in terms of the G\aa{}rding-Gindikin fractional integration and the Cayley type differential operator on the symmetric cone of positive k\times k matrices over \bbK. This generalizes the recent results of Grinberg-Rubin for real Grassmannians.
