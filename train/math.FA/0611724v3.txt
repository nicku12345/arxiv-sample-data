We introduce the notion of uniform gamma-radonification of a family of operators, which unifies the notions of R-boundedness of a family of operators and gamma-radonification of an individual operator. We study the the properties of uniformly gamma-radonifying families of operators in detail and apply our results to the stochastic abstract Cauchy problem dU(t) = AU(t) dt + B dW(t); U(0) = 0 Here, A is the generator of a strongly continuous semigroup of operators on a Banach space E, B is a bounded linear operator from a separable Hilbert space H into E, and W is an H-cylindrical Brownian motion. When A and B are simultaneously diagonalisable, we prove that an invariant measure exists if and only if the family  \{\sqrt{\lambda} R(\lambda, A)B : \lambda > 0\}  is uniformly gamma-radonifying. This result can be viewed as a partial solution of a stochastic version of the Weiss conjecture in linear systems theory.
