The first representation theorem establishes a correspondence between positive, self-adjoint operators and closed, positive forms on Hilbert spaces. The aim of this paper is to show that some of the results remain true if the underlying space is a reflexive Banach space. In particular, the construction of the Friedrichs extension and the form sum of positive operators can be carried over to this case.
