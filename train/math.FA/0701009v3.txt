This paper deals with the interplay of the geometry of the norm and the weak topology in Banach spaces. Both dual and intrinsic connections between weak forms of rotundity and smoothness ared discussed. Weakly exposed points, weakly locally uniformly rotund spaces, smoothness, duality and the interplay of all the above are studied.
