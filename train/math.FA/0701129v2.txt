We prove an inequality that complements the famous Araki-Lieb-Thirring (ALT) inequality for positive matrices A and B, by giving a lower bound on the quantity \trace[A^r B^r A^r]^q in terms of \trace[ABA]^{rq} for 0\le r\le 1 and q\ge0, whereas the ALT inequality gives an upper bound. The bound contains certain norms of A and B as additional ingredients and is therefore of a different nature than the Kantorovich type inequality obtained by Bourin (\textit{Math. Inequal. Appl.} \textbf{8}(2005) pp. 373--378) and others. Secondly, we also prove a generalisation of the ALT inequality to general matrices.
