In this paper I explore a nonstandard formulation of Hausdorff dimension. By considering an adapted form of the counting measure formulation of Lebesgue measure, I prove a nonstandard version of Frostman's lemma and show that Hausdorff dimension can be computed through a counting argument rather than by taking the infimum of a sum of certain covers. This formulation is then applied to obtain a simple proof of the doubling of the dimension of certain sets under a Brownian motion.
