This paper explores the concept of reparametrization invariant norm (RPI-norm), that is any norm invariant under composition with diffeomorphisms. We prove the existence of an infinite family of RPI-norms, called standard RPI-norms, for which we exhibit both an integral and a discrete characterization. Our main result states that, for every one-time differentiable piecewise monotone function with compact support, its standard RPI-norms allow us to compute the value of any other RPI-norm of the same function. This is proved by using the standard RPI-norms in order to reconstruct the function up to reparametrization and an arbitrarily small error with respect to the total variation norm.
