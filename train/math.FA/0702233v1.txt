We prove Lp Poincare inequalities for functions on the discrete cube and their discrete gradient. We thus recover an exponential inequality and the concentration phenomenon for the uniform probability on the cube first obtained by Bobkov and Gotze. Inequalities involving the discrete gradient and powers of the discrete Laplacian are also considered, for the Lp norm or more general ones. Similar results hold true, replacing functions on the cube by elements of the CAR algebra and considering the annihilation operators and the number operator.
