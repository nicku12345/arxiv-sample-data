In this paper we show the weak Banach-Saks property of the Banach vector space (L_\mu^p)^m generated by m L_\mu^p-spaces for 1\leq p<+\infty, where m is any given natural number. When m=1, this is the famous Banach-Saks-Szlenk theorem. By use of this property, we also present inequalities for integrals of functions that are the composition of nonnegative continuous convex functions on a convex set of a vector space {\bf R}^m and vector-valued functions in a weakly compact subset of the space (L_\mu^p)^m for 1\leq p<+\infty and inequalities when these vector-valued functions are in a weakly* compact subset of the product space (L_\mu^\infty)^m generated by m L_\mu^\infty-spaces.
