In this paper we first take a detail survey of the study of the Banach-Saks property of Banach spaces and then show the Banach-Saks property of the product spaces generated by a finite number of Banach spaces having the Banach-Saks property. A more general inequality for integrals of a class of composite functions is also given by using this property.
