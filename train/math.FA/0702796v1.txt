Convoluted C-cosine functions and semigroups in a Banach space setting extending the classes of fractionally integrated C-cosine functions and semigroups are systematically analyzed. Structural properties of such operator families are obtained. Relations between convoluted C-cosine functions and analytic convoluted C-semigroups, introduced and investigated in this paper are given through the convoluted version of the abstract Weierstrass formula which is also proved in the paper. Ultradistribution and hyperfunction sines are connected with analytic convoluted semigroups and ultradistribution semigroups. Several examples of operators generating convoluted cosine functions, (analytic) convoluted semigroups as well as hyperfunction and ultradistribution sines illustrate the abstract approach of the authors. As an application, it is proved that the polyharmonic operator (-\Delta)^{2^{n}}, n\in {\mathbb N}, acting on L^{2}[0,\pi] with appropriate boundary conditions, generates an exponentially bounded K_{n}-convoluted cosine function, and consequently, an exponentially bounded analytic K_{n+1}-convoluted semigroup of angle \frac{\pi}{2}, for suitable exponentially bounded kernels K_{n}  and K_{n+1}.
