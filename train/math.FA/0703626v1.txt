We prove that if X,Y are Banach spaces, \Omega a compact Hausdorff space and U\hbox{\rm :} C(\Omega,X)\to Y is a bounded linear operator, and if U is a Dunford--Pettis operator the range of the representing measure G(\Sigma) \subseteq DP(X,Y) is an uniformly Dunford--Pettis family of operators and \|G\| is continuous at \emptyset. As applications of this result we give necessary and/or sufficient conditions that some bounded linear operators on the space C([0,1],X) with values in c_{0} or l_{p}, (1\leq p<\infty) be Dunford--Pettis and/or compact operators, in which, Khinchin's inequality plays an important role.
