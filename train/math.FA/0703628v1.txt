In this paper we establish the stability of Jensen's functional equation on some classes of groups. We prove that Jensen equation is stable on noncommutative groups such as metabelian groups and T(2, K), where K is an arbitrary commutative field with characteristic different from two. We also prove that any group A can be embedded into some group G such that the Jensen functional equation is stable on G.
