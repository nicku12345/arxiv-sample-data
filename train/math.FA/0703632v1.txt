After a review of how Boson Fock space (of arbitrary multiplicity) may be approximated by a countable Hilbert-space tensor product (known as toy Fock space) it is shown that vacuum-adapted multiple quantum Wiener integrals of bounded operators may be expressed as limits of sums of operators defined on this toy space, with strong convergence on the exponential domain. The vacuum-adapted quantum Ito product formula is derived with the aid of this approximation and a brief pointer is given towards the unbounded case.
