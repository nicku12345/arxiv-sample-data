A suitable notion of hypercontractivity for a nonlinear semigroup \{T_t\} is shown to imply Gagliardo--Nirenberg inequalities for its generator H, provided a subhomogeneity property holds for the energy functional (u,Hu). We use this fact to prove that, for semigroups generated by operators of p--Laplacian--type, hypercontractivity implies ultracontractivity. We then introduce the notion of subordinated nonlinear semigroups when the corresponding Bernstein function is f(x)=x^\alpha, and write down an explicit formula for the associated generator. It is shown that, in certain cases, hypercontractivity still holds for the subordinated semigroup and, hence, that Nash--type inequalities holds as well for the subordinated generator.
