Suppose \Gamma is a Carleson Jordan curve with logarithmic whirl points,   \varrho is a Khvedelidze weight, p:\Gamma\to(1,\infty) is a continuous function satisfying |p(\tau)-p(t)|\le -\mathrm{const}/\log|\tau-t| for |\tau-t|\le 1/2, and L^{p(\cdot)}(\Gamma,\varrho) is a weighted generalized Lebesgue space with variable exponent. We prove that all semi-Fredholm operators in the algebra of singular integral operators with N\times N matrix piecewise continuous coefficients are Fredholm on L_N^{p(\cdot)}(\Gamma,\varrho).
