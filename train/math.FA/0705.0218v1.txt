We prove that if (v_i) is a normalized basic sequence and X is a Banach space such that every normalized weakly null sequence in X has a subsequence that is dominated by (v_i), then there exists a uniform constant C\geq1 such that every normalized weakly null sequence in X has a subsequence that is C-dominated by (v_i). This extends a result of Knaust and Odell, who proved this for the cases in which (v_i) is the standard basis for \ell_p or c_0.
