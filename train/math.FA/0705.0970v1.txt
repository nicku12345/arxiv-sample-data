Let \mathfrak{T} denote the full Toeplitz algebra on the Bergman space of the unit ball \mathbb{B}_n. For each subset G of L^{\infty}, let \mathfrak{CI}(G) denote the closed two-sided ideal of \mathfrak{T} generated by all T_fT_g-T_gT_f with f,g\in G. It is known that \mathfrak{CI}(C(\bar{\mathbb{B}}_n))=\mathcal{K} - the ideal of compact operators and \mathfrak{CI}(C(\mathbb{B}_n))=\mathfrak{T}. Despite these ``extremal cases'', \mathfrak{T} does contain other non-trivial ideals. This paper gives a construction of a class of subsets G of L^{\infty} so that \mathcal{K}\subsetneq\mathfrak{CI}(G)\subsetneq\mathfrak{T}.
