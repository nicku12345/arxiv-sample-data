We study some properties of the randomized series and their applications to the geometric structure of Banach spaces. For n\ge 2 and 1<p<\infty, it is shown that \ell_\infty^n is representable in a Banach space X if and only if it is representable in the Lebesgue-Bochner L_p(X). New criteria for various convexity properties in Banach spaces are also studied. It is proved that a Banach lattice E is uniformly monotone if and only if its p-convexification E^{(p)} is uniformly convex and that a K\"othe function space E is upper locally uniformly monotone if and only if its p-convexification E^{(p)} is midpoint locally uniformly convex.
