A group G is representable in a Banach space X if G is isomorphic to the group of isometries on X in some equivalent norm. We prove that a countable group G is representable in a separable real Banach space X in several general cases, including when G=\{-1,1\} \times H, H finite and \dim X \geq |H|, or when G contains a normal subgroup with two elements and X is of the form c_0(Y) or \ell_p(Y), 1 \leq p <+\infty. This is a consequence of a result inspired by methods of S. Bellenot and stating that under rather general conditions on a separable real Banach space X and a countable bounded group G of isomorphisms on X containing -Id, there exists an equivalent norm on X for which G is equal to the group of isometries on X.   We also extend methods of K. Jarosz to prove that any complex Banach space of dimension at least 2 may be renormed to admit only trivial real isometries, and that any real Banach space which is a cartesian square may be renormed to admit only trivial and conjugation real isometries. It follows that every real space of dimension at least 4 and with a complex structure up to isomorphism may be renormed to admit exactly two complex structures up to isometry, and that every real cartesian square may be renormed to admit a unique complex structure up to isometry.
