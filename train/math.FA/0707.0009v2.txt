The paper deals with weighted spaces L_p^w(G) on a locally compact group G. If w is a positive measurable function on G then we define the space L_p^w(G), p\ge1, as L_p^w(G)=\{f:fw\in L_p(G)\}. We consider weights such that these weighted spaces are algebras with respect to usual convolution. It is shown that for p>1 such weights exists on any sigma-compact group. We prove also a criterion known earlier in special cases: L_1^w(G) is an algebra if and only if w is submultiplicative. It is proved that invariant algebras L_p^w(G), p>1, have approximate units of standard form, but this may not be true for a non-invariant algebra.
