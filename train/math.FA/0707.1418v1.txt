In this paper we introduce the notion of weighted (weakly) almost periodic compactifcation of a semitopological semigroup and generalize this notion to corresponding notion for transformation semigroup.The inclusion relation and equality of some well known function spaces on a weighted transformation semigroup is also investigated.
