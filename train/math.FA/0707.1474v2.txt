In this note, we find sufficient conditions for an operator with kernel of the form A(x)B(y)-A(x)B(y)/(x-y) (which we call a Tracy-Widom type operator) to be the square of a Hankel operator. We consider two contexts: infinite matrices on \ell^2, and integral operators on the Hardy space H^2(\mathbb{T}). The results can be applied to the discrete Bessel kernel, which is significant in random matrix theory.
