Structure of the quotient modules in \hh is very complicated. A good understanding of some special examples will shed light on the general picture. This paper studies the so-call N_{\p}-type quotient modules, namely, quotient modules of the form \hh\ominus [z-\p], where \p (w) is a function in the classical Hardy space H^2(\G) and [z-\p] is the submodule generated by z-\p (w). This type of quotient modules serve as good examples in many studies. A notable feature of the N_{\p}-type quotient module is its close connections with some classical single variable operator theories.
