A classification of weakly compact multiplication operators on L(L_p), 1<p<\infty, is given. This answers a question raised by Saksman and Tylli in 1992. The classification involves the concept of \ell_p-strictly singular operators, and we also investigate the structure of general \ell_p-strictly singular operators on L_p. The main result is that if an operator T on L_p, 1<p<2, is \ell_p-strictly singular and T_{|X} is an isomorphism for some subspace X of L_p, then X embeds into L_r for all r<2, but X need not be isomorphic to a Hilbert space.   It is also shown that if T is convolution by a biased coin on L_p of the Cantor group, 1\le p <2, and T_{|X} is an isomorphism for some reflexive subspace X of L_p, then X is isomorphic to a Hilbert space. The case p=1 answers a question asked by Rosenthal in 1976.
