Given a Banach space X, denote by SP_{w}(X) the set of equivalence classes of spreading models of X generated by normalized weakly null sequences in X. It is known that SP_{w}(X) is a semilattice, i.e., it is a partially ordered set in which every pair of elements has a least upper bound. We show that every countable semilattice that does not contain an infinite increasing sequence is order isomorphic to SP_{w}(X) for some separable Banach space X.
