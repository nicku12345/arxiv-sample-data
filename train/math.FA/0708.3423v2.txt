In this note, we answer a question raised by Johnson and Schechtman \cite{JS}, about the hypercontractive semigroup on \{-1,1\}^{\NN}. More generally, we prove the folllowing theorem. Let 1<p<2. Let (T(t))_{t>0} be a holomorphic semigroup on L_p (relative to a probability space). Assume the following mild form of hypercontractivity: for some large enough number s>0, T(s) is bounded from L_p to L_2. Then for any t>0, T(t) is in the norm closure in B(L_p) (denoted by \bar{\Gamma_2}) of the subset (denoted by {\Gamma_2}) formed by the operators mapping L_p to L_2 (a fortiori these operators factor through a Hilbert space).
