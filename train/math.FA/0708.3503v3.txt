Let X_{1},...,X_{n} be compact spaces and X=X_{1}\times ... \times X_{n}. Consider the approximation of a function f\in C(X) by sums g_{1}(x_{1})+... g_{n}(x_{n}), where g_{i}\in C(X_{i}), i=1,...,n. In [8], M.Golomb obtained a formula for the error of this approximation in terms of measures constructed on special points of X, called "projection cycles". However, his proof had a gap, which was pointed out by Marshall and O'Farrell [15]. But the question if the formula was correct, remained open. The purpose of the paper is to prove that Golomb's formula holds in a stronger form.
