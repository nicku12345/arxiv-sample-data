Let K be a Hausdorff space and C_b(K) be the Banach algebra of all complex bounded continuous functions on K. We study the G\^{a}teaux and Fr\'echet differentiability of subspaces of C_b(K). Using this, we show that the set of all strong peak functions in a nontrivial separating separable subspace H of C_b(K) is a dense G_\delta subset of H, if K is compact. This gives a generalized Bishop's theorem, which says that the closure of the set of strong peak point for H is the smallest closed norming subset of H. The classical Bishop's theorem was proved for a separating subalgebra H and a metrizable compact space K.   In the case that X is a complex Banach space with the Radon-Nikod\'ym property, we show that the set of all strong peak functions in A_b(B_X)=\{f\in C_b(B_X) : f|_{B_X^\circ} {is holomorphic}\} is dense. As an application, we show that the smallest closed norming subset of A_b(B_X) is the closure of the set of all strong peak points for A_b(B_X). This implies that the norm of A_b(B_X) is G\^{a}teaux differentiable on a dense subset of A_b(B_X), even though the norm is nowhere Fr\'echet differentiable when X is nontrivial. We also study the denseness of norm attaining holomorphic functions and polynomials. Finally we investigate the existence of numerical Shilov boundary.
