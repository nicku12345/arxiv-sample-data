This paper gives some simple estimates of the essential norm for the difference of composition operators induced by \phi and \psi acting on bounded function space in the unit polydiscs U^n, where \phi(z) and \psi(z)be holomorphic self-maps of U^n. As its applications, a characterization of compact difference is given for composition operators acting on the bounded function spaces.
