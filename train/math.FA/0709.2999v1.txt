Let Q denote the space of signed measures on the Borel \sigma-algebra of a separable complete space X. We endow Q with the norm \|q\|=\sup|\int\phi dq|, where the supremum is taken over all Lipschitz with constant 1 functions whose module does not exceed unity. This normed space is incomplete provided X is infinite and has at least one limit point. We call its completion the space of hypermeasures. Necessary and sufficient conditions for precompactness (=relative compactness) of a set of hypermeasures are found. They are similar to those of Prokhorov's and Fernique's theorems for measures.
