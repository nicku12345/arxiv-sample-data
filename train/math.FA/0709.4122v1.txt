We give an equivariant version of Packer and Rieffel's theorem on sufficient conditions for the existence of orthonormal wavelets in projective multiresolution analyses. The scaling functions that generate a projective multiresolution analysis are supposed to be invariant with respect to some finite group action. We give sufficient conditions for the existence of wavelets with similar invariance.
