We approximate a fuzzy almost quadratic function by a quadratic function in a fuzzy sense. More precisely, we establish a fuzzy Hyers--Ulam--Rassias stability of the quadratic functional equation f(x+y)+f(x-y)=2f(x)+2f(y). Our result can be regarded as a generalization of the stability phenomenon in the framework of normed spaces. We also prove a generalized version of fuzzy stability of the Pexiderized quadratic functional equation f(x+y)+f(x-y)=2g(x)+2h(y).
