I prove, under mild assumptions, that solutions to linear evolution equations admit sectorial solutions. The size of the sector depends on the regularity of the initial data. If it is regular enough the solution is holomorphic and unique otherwise it is sectorial. I also prove that the result is optimal for many partial differential systems (which includes KdV and other examples).
