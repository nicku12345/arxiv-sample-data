Let \mathfrak{H}_{0} denote the class of commuting pairs of subnormal operators on Hilbert space, and let \mathcal{TC}:=\{\mathbf{T}\in \mathfrak{% H}_{0}:c(\mathbf{T)} is of tensor form\}, where c(\mathbf{T}) is the core of \mathbf{T}. We obtain a concrete necessary and sufficient condition for the subnormality of \mathbf{T}\equiv (T_{1},T_{2})\in \mathcal{TC} in terms of c(\mathbf{T}), the marginal measures of T_{1} and T_{2}, and the weight \alpha_{01}.
