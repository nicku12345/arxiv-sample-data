Let S be a dense sub-semigroup of the positive real numbers, and let X be a separable, reflexive Banach space. This note contains a proof that every weakly continuous contractive semigroup of operators on X over S can be extended to a weakly continuous semigroup over the positive real numbers. We obtain similar results for non-linear, non-expansive semigroups as well. As a corollary we characterize all densely parametrized semigroups which are extendable to semigroups over the positive real numbers.
