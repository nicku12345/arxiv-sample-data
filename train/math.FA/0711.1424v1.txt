We introduce a new concept of the so-called {\it composite wavelet transforms}. These transforms are generated by two components, namely, a kernel function and a wavelet function (or a measure). The composite wavelet transforms and the relevant Calder\'{o}n-type reproducing formulas constitute a unified approach to explicit inversion of the Riesz, Bessel, Flett, parabolic and some other operators of the potential type generated by ordinary (Euclidean) and generalized (Bessel) translations. This approach is exhibited in the paper. Another concern is application of the composite wavelet transforms to explicit inversion of the k-plane Radon transform on \bbr^n. We also discuss in detail a series of open problems arising in wavelet analysis of L_p-functions of matrix argument.
