In this paper, first we give a simple criterion for the Arens regularity of a bilinear mapping on normed spaces, which applies in particular to Banach module actions and then we investigate those conditions under which the second adjoint of a derivation into a dual Banach module is again a derivation. As a consequence of the main result, a simple and direct proof for several older results is also included.
