In this paper, weakly homogeneous generalized functions in the special Colombeau algebras are determined up to equality in the sense of generalized distributions. This yields characterizations that are formally similar to distribution theory. Further, we give several characterizations of equality in the sense of generalized distributions in these algebras.
