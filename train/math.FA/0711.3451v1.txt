The dyadic paraproduct is bounded in weighted Lebesgue spaces L_p(w) if and only if the weight w belongs to the Muckenhoupt class A_p^d. However, the sharp bounds on the norm of the dyadic paraproduct are not known even in the simplest L_2(w) case. In this paper we prove the linear bound on the norm of the dyadic paraproduct in the weighted Lebesgue space L_2(w) using Bellman function techniques and extrapolate this result to the L_p(w) case.
