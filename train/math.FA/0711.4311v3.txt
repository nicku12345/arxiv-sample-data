It is known that {\cal B}(\ell^p) is not amenable for p =1,2,\infty, but whether or not {\cal B}(\ell^p) is amenable for p \in (1,\infty) \setminus \{2 \} is an open problem. We show that, if {\cal B}(\ell^p) is amenable for p \in (1,\infty), then so are \ell^\infty({\cal B}(\ell^p)) and \ell^\infty({\cal K}(\ell^p)). Moreover, if \ell^\infty({\cal K}(\ell^p)) is amenable so is \ell^\infty(\mathbb{I},{\cal K}(E)) for any index set \mathbb I and for any infinite-dimensional {\cal L}^p-space E; in particular, if \ell^\infty({\cal K}(\ell^p)) is amenable for p \in (1,\infty), then so is \ell^\infty({\cal K}(\ell^p \oplus \ell^2)). We show that \ell^\infty({\cal K}(\ell^p \oplus \ell^2)) is not amenable for p =1,\infty, but also that our methods fail us if p \in (1,\infty). Finally, for p \in (1,2) and a free ultrafilter \cal U over \posints, we exhibit a closed left ideal of ({\cal K}(\ell^p))_{\cal U} lacking a right approximate identity, but enjoying a certain, very weak complementation property.
