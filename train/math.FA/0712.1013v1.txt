Suppose that \Gamma is a continuous and self-adjoint Hankel operator on L^2(0, \infty) and that Lf=-(d/dx(a(x)df/dx))+b(x)f(x) with a(0)=0. If a and b are both quadratic, hyperbolic or trigonometric functions, and \phi satisfies a suitable form of Gauss's hypergeometric equation, or the confluent hypergeometric equation, then L\Gamma =\Gamma L. The paper catalogues the commuting pairs \Gamma and L, including important cases in random matrix theory. There are also results proving rapid decay of the singular numbers of Hankel integral operators with kernels that are analytic and of exponential decay in the right half plane.
