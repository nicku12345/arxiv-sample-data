Associated to a nonzero homomorphism \varphi of a Banach algebra A, we regard special functionals, say m_\varphi, on certain subspaces of A^\ast which provide equivalent statements to the existence of a bounded right approximate identity in the corresponding maximal ideal in A. For instance, applying a fixed point theorem yields an equivalent statement to the existence of a m_\varphi on A^\ast; and, in addition we expatiate the case that if a functional m_\varphi is unique, then m_\varphi belongs to the topological center of the bidual algebra A^{\ast\ast}. An example of a function algebra, surprisingly, contradicts a conjecture that a Banach algebra A is amenable if A is \varphi-amenable in every character \varphi and if functionals m_\varphi associated to the characters \varphi are uniformly bounded. Aforementioned are also elaborated on the direct sum of two given Banach algebras.
