The main purpose is to generalize a theorem of Arendt about uniqueness of C_0-semigroups from Banach space setting to the general locally convex vector spaces, more precisely, we show that cores are the only domains of uniqueness for C_0-semigroups on locally convex spaces. As an application, we find a necessary and sufficient condition for that the mass transport equation has one unique L^1(\R^d,dx) weak solution.
