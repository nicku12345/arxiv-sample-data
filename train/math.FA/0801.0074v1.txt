A new approach to the algebra G_{\tau} of temperate nonlinear generalized functions is proposed, in which G_{\tau} is based on the space O_{M} endowed with is natural topology in contrary to previous constructions. Thus, this construction fits perfectly in the general scheme of construction of Colombeau type algebras and reveals better properties of G_{\tau}. This is illustrated by the natural introduction of a regularity theory in G_{\tau}, of the Fourier transform, with the definition of G_{O_{C prime}}, the space of rapidly generalized distributions which is the Fourier image of G_{\tau}.
