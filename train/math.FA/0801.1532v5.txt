The algebra of Schur operators on l^2 is known not to be inverse-closed. When l^2=l^2(X) where X is a metric space, we can consider elements of the Schur algebra with certain decay at infinity. For instance if X has the doubling property, then Q. Sun has proved that the weighted Schur algebra for a strictly polynomial weight is inverse-closed. Here, we prove a result dealing with left-invertibility. Namely, if such an operator is bounded below in l^p for some p, then it is bounded below for all q, and it admits a left-inverse in the weighted Schur algebra.
