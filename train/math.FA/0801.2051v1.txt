Given an infinite-dimensional Banach space X and a Banach space Y with no finite cotype, we determine whether or not every continuous linear operator from X to Y is absolutely (q;p)-summing for almost all choices of p and q, including the case p=q. If X assumes its cotype, the problem is solved for all choices of p and q. Applications to the theory of dominated multilinear mappings are also provided.
