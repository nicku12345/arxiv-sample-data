Let \epsilon >0. A continuous linear operator   T:C(X) \ra C(Y) is said to be {\em \epsilon-disjointness preserving} if \vc (Tf)(Tg)\vd_{\infty} \le \epsilon, whenever f,g\in C(X) satisfy \vc f\vd_{\infty} =\vc g\vd_{\infty} =1 and fg\equiv 0. In this paper we address basically two main questions:   1.- How close there must be a weighted composition operator to a given \epsilon-disjointness preserving operator?   2.- How far can the set of weighted composition operators be from a given \epsilon-disjointness preserving operator?   We address these two questions distinguishing among three cases: X infinite, X finite, and Y a singleton (\epsilon-disjointness preserving functionals).   We provide sharp stability and instability bounds for the three cases.
