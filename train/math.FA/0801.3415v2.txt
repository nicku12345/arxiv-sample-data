We continue the investigation of notions of approximate amenability that were introduced in work of the second and third authors. It is shown that every boundedly approximately contractible Banach algebra has a bounded approximate identity.   Among our other results, it is shown that the Fourier algebra of the free group on two generators is not approximately amenable. Further examples are obtained of {\ell}^1-semigroup algebras which are approximately amenable but not amenable; using these, we show that bounded approximate amenability need not imply sequential approximate amenability. Results are also given for Segal subalgebras of L^1(G), where G is a locally compact group, and the algebras PF_p(\Gamma) of p-pseudofunctions on a discrete group \Gamma (of which the reduced C^*-algebra is a special case).
