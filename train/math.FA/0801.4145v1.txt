The paper gives a short account of some basic properties of \textit{Dirichlet-to-Neumann} operators \Lambda_{\gamma,\partial\Omega} including the corresponding semigroups motivated by the Laplacian transport in anisotropic media (\gamma \neq I) and by elliptic systems with dynamical boundary conditions. For illustration of these notions and the properties we use the explicitly constructed \textit{Lax semigroups}. We demonstrate that for a general smooth bounded convex domain \Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^d the corresponding {Dirichlet-to-Neumann} semigroup \left\{U(t):= e^{-t \Lambda_{\gamma,\partial\Omega}}\right\}_{t\geq0} in the Hilbert space L^2(\partial \Omega) belongs to the \textit{trace-norm} von Neumann-Schatten ideal for any t>0. This means that it is in fact an \textit{immediate Gibbs} semigroup. Recently Emamirad and Laadnani have constructed a \textit{Trotter-Kato-Chernoff} product-type approximating family \left\{(V_{\gamma, \partial\Omega}(t/n))^n \right\}_{n \geq 1} \textit{strongly} converging to the semigroup U(t) for n\to\infty. We conclude the paper by discussion of a conjecture about convergence of the \textit{Emamirad-Laadnani approximantes} in the the {\textit{trace-norm}} topology.
