Recently in [1] a new class of maximal monotone operators has been introduced. In this note we study domain range properties as well as connections with other classes and calculus rules for these operators we called strongly-representable. While not every maximal monotone operator is strongly-representable, every maximal monotone NI operator is strongly-representable, and every strongly representable operator is locally maximal monotone, maximal monotone locally, and ANA. As a consequence the conjugate of the Fitzpatrick function of a maximal monotone operator is not necessarily a representative function.
