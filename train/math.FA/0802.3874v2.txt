The article is devoted to different aspects of the question "What can be done with a matrix by low rank perturbation?" It is proved that one can change a geometrically simple spectrum drastically by a rank 1 permutation, but the situation is quite different if one restricts oneself to normal matrices. Also, the Jordan normal form of a perturbed matrix is considered. It is proved that with respect to rank as a distance all almost unitary matrices are near unitary.
