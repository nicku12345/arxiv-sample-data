For \alpha>-1, let A^2_{\alpha} be the corresponding weighted Bergman space of the unit ball in \mathbb{C}^n. For a bounded measurable function f, let T_f be the Toeplitz operator with symbol f on A^2_{\alpha}. This paper describes all the functions f for which T_f commutes with a given T_g, where g(z)=z_{1}^{L_1}... z_{n}^{L_n} for strictly positive integers L_1,..., L_n, or g(z)=|z_1|^{s_1}... |z_n|^{s_n}h(|z|) for non-negative real numbers s_1,..., s_n and a bounded measurable function h on [0,1).
