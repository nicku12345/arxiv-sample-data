For any function f in L^{\infty}(\mathbb{D}), let T_f denote the corresponding Toeplitz operator the Bergman space A^2(\mathbb{D}). A recent result of D. Luecking shows that if T_f has finite rank then f must be the zero function. Using a refined version of this result, we show that if all except possibly one of the functions f_1,..., f_{m} are radial and T_{f_1}... T_{f_m} has finite rank, then one of these functions must be zero.
