We prove strong hypercontractivity (SHC) inequalities for logarithmically subharmonic functions on \RR^n and different classes of measures: Gaussian measures on \RR^n, symmetric Bernoulli and symmetric uniform probability measures on \RR, as well as their convolutions. Surprisingly, a slightly weaker strong hypercontractivity property holds for {\em any} symmetric measure on \RR. For all measures on \R for which we know the (SHC) holds, we prove that a log--Sobolev inequality holds in the log-subharmonic category with a constant {\em smaller} than the one for Gaussian measure in the classical context. This result is extended to all dimensions for compactly-supported measures.
