Criterion of (Shilov) regularity for weighted algebras L_1^w(G) on a locally compact abelian group G is known by works of Beurling (1949) and Domar (1956). In the present paper this criterion is extended to translation invariant weighted algebras L_p^w(G) with p>1. Regular algebras L_p^w(G) are constructed on any sigma-compact abelian group G. It was proved earlier by the author that sigma-compactness is necessary (in the abelian case) for the existence of weighted algebras L_p^w(G) with p>1.
