In finitely-dimensional spaces the sum range of a series has to be an affine subspace. It is long known this is not the case in infinitely dimensional Banach spaces. In particular in 1984 M.I. Kadets and K. Wo\`{z}niakowski obtained an example of a series the sum range of which consisted of two points, and asked whether it is possible to obtain more than two, but finitely many points. This paper answers the question positively, by showing how to obtain an arbitrary finite set as the sum range of a series in any infinitely dimensional Banach space.
