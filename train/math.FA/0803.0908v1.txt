The Feichtinger Conjecture, if true, would have as a corollary that for each set E\subset \T and \Lambda \subset \Z, there is a partition \Lambda_1,...,\Lambda_N of \Z such that for each 1\le i \le N, \{\exp(2\pi i x\lambda): \lambda \in \Lambda_i\} is a Riesz sequence. In this paper, sufficient conditions on sets E\subset \T and \Lambda\subset \R are given so that \{\exp(2\pi i x\lambda) 1_E: \lambda \in \Lambda\} can be uniformly partitioned into Riesz sequences.
