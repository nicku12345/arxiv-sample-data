Let y=f(x) be a continuously differentiable implicit function solving the equation F(x,y)=0 with continuously differentiable F. In this paper we show that if F_\eps is a Lipschitz function such that the Lipschitz constant of F_\eps-F goes to 0 as \eps\to 0 then the equation F_\eps(x,y)=0 has a Lipschitz solution y=f_\eps(x) such that the Lipschitz constant of f_\eps-f goes to 0 as \eps\to 0 either. As an application we evaluate the length of time intervals where the right hand parts of some nonautonomous discontinuous systems of ODEs are continuously differentiable with respect to state variables. The latter is done as a preparatory step toward generalizing the second Bogolyubov's theorem for discontinuous systems.
