Let T_1: L_2(\Omega^2) \to L_2(\Omega^2) be a partial integral operator with the kernel from C(\Omega^3) where \Omega=[a,b ]^\nu. In this paper we investigate solvability of a partial integral equation f-\varkappa T_1 f=g_0 in the space L_2(\Omega^2) in the case when \varkappa is a characteristic number. We proved the theorem describing the necessary and sufficient condition for solvability of the partial integral equation f-\varkappa T_1 f=g_0.
