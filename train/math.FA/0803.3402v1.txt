In this article we answer a question raised by N. Feldman in \cite{Feldman} concerning the dynamics of tuples of operators on \mathbb{R}^n. In particular, we prove that for every positive integer n\geq 2 there exist n tuples (A_1, A_2, ..., A_n) of n\times n matrices over \mathbb{R} such that (A_1, A_2, ..., A_n) is hypercyclic. We also establish related results for tuples of 2\times 2 matrices over \mathbb{R} or \mathbb{C} being in Jordan form.
