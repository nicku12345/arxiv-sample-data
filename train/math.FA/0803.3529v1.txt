H. Landau's necessary density conditions for sampling and interpolation may be viewed as a general principle resting on a basic fact of Fourier analysis: The complex exponentials e^{i kx} (k in \mathbb{Z}) constitute an orthogonal basis for L^2([-\pi,\pi]). The present paper extends Landau's conditions to the setting of locally compact abelian (LCA) groups, relying in an analogous way on the basics of Fourier analysis. The technicalities--in either case of an operator theoretic nature--are however quite different. We will base our proofs on the comparison principle of J. Ramanathan and T. Steger.
