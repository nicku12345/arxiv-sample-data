We will introduce the countable separation property (CSP) of Banach spaces X, which is defined as follows: For each subset \mathcal{F} of X^{\ast}, which separates X, there exists a countable separating subset \mathcal{F}_{0} of \mathcal{F}. All separable Banach spaces have CSP and plenty of examples of non-separable CSP spaces are provided. Connections of CSP with Markucevic-bases, Corson property and related geometric issues are discussed.
