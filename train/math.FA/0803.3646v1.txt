We characterize Hilbert spaces in the class of all Banach spaces using Fourier transform of vector-valued functions over the field Q_p of p-adic numbers. Precisely, Banach space X is isomorphic to a Hilbert one if and only if Fourier transform F: L_2(Q_p,X)\to L_2(Q_p,X) in space of functions, which are square-integrable in Bochner sense and take value in X, is a bounded operator.
