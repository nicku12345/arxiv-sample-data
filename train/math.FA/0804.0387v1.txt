For a tuple A=(A_0, A_1, ..., A_n) of elements in a unital Banach algebra {\mathcal B}, its {\em projective spectrum} p(A) is defined to be the collection of z=[z_0, z_1, ..., z_n]\in \pn such that A(z)=z_0A_0+z_1A_1+... +z_nA_n is not invertible in {\mathcal B}. The pre-image of p(A) in {\cc}^{n+1} is denoted by P(A). When {\mathcal B} is the k\times k matrix algebra M_k(\cc), the projective spectrum is a projective hypersurface. In infinite dimensional cases, projective spectrums can be very complicated, but also have some properties similar to that of hypersurfaces. When A is commutative, P(A) is a union of hyperplanes. When {\mathcal B} is reflexive or is a C^*-algebra, the {\em projective resolvent set} P^c(A):=\cc^{n+1}\setminus P(A) is shown to be a disjoint union of domains of holomorphy. Later part of this paper studies Maurer-Cartan type {\mathcal B}-valued 1-form A^{-1}(z)dA(z) on P^c(A). As a consequence, we show that if {\mathcal B} is a C^*-algebra with a trace \phi, then \phi(A^{-1}(z)dA(z)) is a nontrivial element in the de Rham cohomology space H^1_d(P^c(A), \cc).
