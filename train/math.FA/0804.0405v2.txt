We shall consider the truncated singular integral operators T_{\mu, K}^{\epsilon}f(x)=\int_{\mathbb{R}^{n}\setminus B(x,\epsilon)}K(x-y)f(y)d\mu y and related maximal operators T_{\mu,K}^{\ast}f(x)=\underset{\epsilon >0}{\sup}| T_{\mu,K}^{\epsilon}f(x)|. We shall prove for a large class of kernels K and measures \mu and \nu that if \mu and \nu are separated by a Lipschitz graph, then T_{\nu,K}^{\ast}:L^p(\nu)\to L^p(\mu) is bounded for 1<p<\infty. We shall also show that the truncated operators T_{\mu, K}^{\epsilon} converge weakly in some dense subspaces of L^2(\mu) under mild assumptions for the measures and the kernels.
