A Banach space has the weak fixed point property if its dual space has a weak^* sequentially compact unit ball and the dual space satisfies the weak^* uniform Kadec-Klee property; and it has the \fpp if there exists \epsilon>0 such that, for every infinite subset A of the unit sphere of the dual space, A\cup (-A) fails to be (2-\epsilon)-separated. In particular, E-convex Banach spaces, a class of spaces that includes the uniformly nonsquare spaces, have the fixed point property.
