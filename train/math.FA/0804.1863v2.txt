This is a survey of recent results about bipotentials representing multivalued operators. The notion of bipotential is based on an extension of Fenchel's inequality, with several interesting applications related to non associated constitutive laws in non smooth mechanics, such as Coulomb frictional contact or non-associated Drucker-Prager model in plasticity.   Relations betweeen bipotentials and Fitzpatrick functions are described. Selfdual lagrangians, introduced and studied by Ghoussoub, can be seen as bipotentials representing maximal monotone operators. We show that bipotentials can represent some monotone but not maximal operators, as well as non monotone operators.   Further we describe results concerning the construction of a bipotential which represents a given non monotone operator, by using convex lagrangian covers or bipotential convex covers.
