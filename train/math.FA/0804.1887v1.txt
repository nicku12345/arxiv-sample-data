We show that if Z is "homogeneously multifractal" (in a sense we precisely define), then Z is the composition of a monofractal function g with a time subordinator f (i.e. f is the integral of a positive Borel measure supported by \zu). When the initial function Z is given, the monofractality exponent of the associated function g is uniquely determined. We study in details a classical example of multifractal functions Z, for which we exhibit the associated functions g and f. This provides new insights into the understanding of multifractal behaviors of functions.
