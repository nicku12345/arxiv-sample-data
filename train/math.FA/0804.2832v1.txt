We introduce a new concept of perturbation of closed linear subspaces and operators in Banach spaces called uniform lambda-adjustment which is weaker than perturbations by small gap, operator norm, q-norm, and K2-approximation. In arbitrary Banach spaces some of the classical Fredholm stability theorems remain true under uniform lambda-adjustment, while other fail. However, uniformly lambda-adjusted subspaces and linear operators retain their (semi--)Fredholm properties in a Banach space which dual is Fr\'{e}chet-Urysohn in weak* topology. We also introduce another concept of perturbation called uniform mu-approximation which is weaker than perturbations by small gap, norm, and compact convergence, yet stronger than uniform lambda-adjustment. We present Fredholm stability theorems for uniform mu-approximation in arbitrary Banach spaces and a theorem on stability of Riesz kernels and ranges for commuting closed essentially Kato operators. Finally, we define the new concepts of a tuple of subspaces and of a complex of subspaces in Banach spaces, and present stability theorems for index and defect numbers of Fredholm tuples and complexes under uniform lambda-adjustment and uniform mu-approximation.
