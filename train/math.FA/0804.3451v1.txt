In this note, we show that if a Banach space X has a predual, then every bounded linear operator on X with a continuous functional calculus admits a bounded Borel functional calculus. A consequence of this is that on such a Banach space, the classes of finitely spectral and prespectral operators coincide. We also apply this result to give some sufficient conditions for an operator with an absolutely continuous functional calculus to admit a bounded Borel one.
