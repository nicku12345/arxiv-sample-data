We prove that in variable exponent spaces L^{p(\cdot)}(\Omega), where p(\cdot) satisfies the log-condition and \Omega is a bounded domain in \mathbf R^n with the property that \mathbf R^n \backslash \bar{\Omega} has the cone property, the validity of the Hardy type inequality | 1/\delta(x)^\alpha \int_\Omega \phi(y) dy/|x-y|^{n-\alpha}|_{p(\cdot)} \leqq C |\phi|_{p(\cdot)}, \quad 0<\al<\min(1,\frac{n}{p_+}), where \delta(x)=\mathrm{dist}(x,\partial\Omega), is equivalent to a certain property of the domain \Om expressed in terms of \al and \chi_\Om.
