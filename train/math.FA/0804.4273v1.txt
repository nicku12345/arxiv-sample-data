We prove that the order k differentiability classes for k=0,1,...\infty in the "arc-generated" interpretation of the Lipschitz theory of differentiation by Frolicher and Kriegl can be obtained as particular cases of the general construction by Bertram, Glockner and Neeb leading to C^k differentiabilities from a given C^0 concept.
