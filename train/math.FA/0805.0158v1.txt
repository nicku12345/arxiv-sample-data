We consider BMO spaces of operator-valued functions, among them the space of operator-valued functions B which define a bounded paraproduct on L^2(H). We obtain several equivalent formulations of \|\pi_B\| in terms of the norm of the "sweep" function of B or of averages of the norms of martingales transforms of B in related spaces. Furthermore, we investigate a connection between John-Nirenberg type inequalities and Carleson-type inequalities via a product formula for paraproducts and deduce sharp dimensional estimates for John-Nirenberg type inequalities.
