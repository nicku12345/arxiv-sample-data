We investigate a scale of dyadic operator-valued BMO spaces, corresponding to the different yet equivalent characterizations of dyadic BMO in the scalar case. In the language of operator spaces, we investigate different operator space structures on the scalar dyadic BMO space which arise naturally from the different characterisations of scalar BMO. We also give sharp dimensional growth estimates for the sweep of functions and its bilinear extension in some of those different dyadic BMO spaces.
