We present a brief survey of recent results on boundedness of some classical operators within the frameworks of weighted spaces L^{p(\cdot)}(\varrho) with variable exponent p(x), mainly in the Euclidean setting and dwell on a new result of the boundedness of the Hardy-Littlewood maximal operator in the space L^{p(\cdot)}(X,\varrho) over a metric measure space X satisfying the doubling condition. In the case where X is bounded, the weight function satisfies a certain version of a general Muckenhoupt-type condition For a bounded or unbounded X we also consider a class of weights of the form \varrho(x)=[1+d(x_0,x)]^{\bt_\infty}\prod_{k=1}^m w_k(d(x,x_k)), x_k\in X, where the functions w_k(r) have finite upper and lower indices m(w_k) and M(w_k).   Some of the results are new even in the case of constant p.
