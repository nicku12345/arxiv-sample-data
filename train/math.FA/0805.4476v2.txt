We consider different types of (local) products f_1 f_2 in Fourier Lebesgue spaces. Furthermore, we prove the existence of such products for other distributions satisfying appropriate wave-front properties. We also consider semi-linear equations of the form  \qquad P(x,D)f = G(x,J_k f),  with appropriate polynomials P  and G. If the solution locally belongs to appropriate weighted Fourier Lebesgue space {\mathscr F}L^q_{(\omega)} (\rr d) and P is non-characteristic at (x_0,\xi_0), then we prove that (x_0,\xi_0)\not \in WF_{{\mathscr F}L^q_{(\widetilde {\omega})}} (f), where \widetilde{\omega} depends on \omega, P and G.
