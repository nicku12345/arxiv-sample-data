All compact AC(\sigma) operators have a representation analogous to that for compact normal operators. As a partial converse we obtain conditions which allow one to construct a large number of such operators. Using the results in the paper, we answer a number of questions about the decomposition of a compact AC(\sigma) into real and imaginary parts.
