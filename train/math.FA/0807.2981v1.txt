Let X be a Banach space. It is proved that an analogue of the Rubio de Francia square function estimate for partial sums of the Fourier series of X-valued functions holds true for all disjoint collections of subintervals of the set of integers of equal length and for all exponents p greater or equal than 2 if and only if the space X is a UMD space of type 2. The same criterion is obtained for the case of subintervals of the real line and Fourier integrals instead of Fourier series.
