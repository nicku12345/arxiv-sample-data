Let S be the semigroup with identity, generated by x and y, subject to y being invertible and yx=xy^2. We study two Banach algebra completions of the semigroup algebra \mathbb{C}S. Both completions are shown to be left-primitive and have separating families of irreducible infinite-dimensional right modules. As an appendix, we offer an alternative proof that \mathbb{C}S is left-primitive but not right-primitive. We show further that, in contrast to the completions, every irreducible right module for \mathbb{C}S is finite dimensional and hence that \mathbb{C}S has a separating family of such modules.
