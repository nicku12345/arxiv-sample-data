We show that the biflatness - in the sense of A. Ya. Helemskii - of the Fourier algebra A(G) of a locally compact group G forces G to either have an abelian subgroup of finite index or to be non-amenable without containing F_2, the free group in two generators, as a closed subgroup. An analogous dichotomy is obtained for biprojectivity.
