The present paper, is devoted to investigation of operator--valued Fourier multiplier theorems from B_{q_{1},r}^{s} to B_{q_{2},r}^{s}, optimal embedding of Besov spaces, the separability and positivity of differential operators. Here, we show that these differential operators generate analytic semigroup.
