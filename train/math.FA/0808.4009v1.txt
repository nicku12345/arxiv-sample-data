We consider Fourier transform of vector-valued functions on a locally compact group G, which take value in a Banach space X, and are square-integrable in Bochner sense. If G is a finite group then Fourier transform is a bounded operator. If G is an infinite group then Fourier transform F: L_2(G,X)\to L_2(\widehat G,X) is a bounded operator if and only if Banach space X is isomorphic to a Hilbert one.
