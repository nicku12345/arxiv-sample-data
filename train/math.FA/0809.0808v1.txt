In this paper, we use characteristic classes of the canonical vector bundles and the Poincar\' {e} dualality to study the structure of the real homology and cohomology groups of oriented Grassmann manifold G(k, n). Show that for k=2 or n\leq 8, the cohomology groups H^*(G(k,n),{\bf R}) are generated by the first Pontrjagin class, the Euler classes of the canonical vector bundles. In these cases, the Poincar\' {e} dualality: H^q(G(k,n),{\bf R}) \to H_{k(n-k)-q}(G(k,n),{\bf R}) can be given explicitly.
