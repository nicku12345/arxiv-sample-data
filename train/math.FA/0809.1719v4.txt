In this note we describe the dual and the completion of the space of finite linear combinations of (p,\infty)-atoms, 0<p\leq 1 on {\mathbb R}^n. As an application, we show an extension result for operators uniformly bounded on (p,\infty)-atoms, 0<p < 1, whose analogue for p=1 is known to be false. Let 0 < p <1 and let T be a linear operator defined on the space of finite linear combinations of (p,\infty)-atoms, 0<p < 1 , which takes values in a Banach space B. If T is uniformly bounded on (p,\infty)-atoms, then T extends to a bounded operator from H^p({\mathbb R}^n) into B.
