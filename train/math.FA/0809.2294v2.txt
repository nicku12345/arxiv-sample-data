We show that a separable real Banach space embeds almost isometrically in a space Y with a shrinking 1-unconditional basis if and only if \lim_{n \to \infty} \|x^* + x_n^*\| = \lim_{n \to \infty} \|x^* - x_n^*\| whenever x^* \in X^*, (x_n^*) is a weak^*-null sequence and both limits exist. If X is reflexive then Y can be assumed reflexive. These results provide the isometric counterparts of recent work of Johnson and Zheng.
