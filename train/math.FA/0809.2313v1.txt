The aim of the present paper is to obtain a Sj\"{o}lin-type maximal estimate for pseudo-differential operators with homogeneous symbols. The crux of the proof is to obtain a phase decomposition formula which does not involve the time traslation. The proof is somehow parallel to the paper by Pramanik and Terwilleger (P. Malabika and E. Terwilleger, A weak L^2 estimate for a maximal dyadic sum operator on R^n, Illinois J. Math, {\bf 47} (2003), no. 3, 775--813). In the present paper, we mainly concentrate on our new phase decomposition formula and the results in the Cotlar type estimate, which are different from the ones by Pramanik and Terwilleger.
