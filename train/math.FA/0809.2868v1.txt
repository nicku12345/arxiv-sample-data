Assume that m\ge 2 and let l be a nonnegative integer with l\ge m-4. We give an alternative proof of the fact that any smooth function defined locally around (0,0)\in \mathbb{R}^2 with the Taylor power series at (0,0) beginning with Re(x+iy)^m+0+...+0 (l zeros) is diffeomorphically equivalent to Re(x+iy)^m at (0,0). For m\ge 5 and C\ne 0 we show that the function Re(x+iy)^m+C(x^2+y^2)^{m-2} is not diffeomorphically equivalent to Re(x+iy)^m at (0,0).
