The main result is that the commutators on \ell_1 are the operators not of the form \lambda I + K with \lambda\neq 0 and K compact. We generalize Apostol's technique (1972, Rev. Roum. Math. Appl. 17, 1513 - 1534) to obtain this result and use this generalization to obtain partial results about the commutators on spaces \X which can be represented as \displaystyle \X\simeq (\bigoplus_{i=0}^{\infty} \X)_{p} for some 1\leq p<\infty or p=0. In particular, it is shown that every compact operator on L_1 is a commutator. A characterization of the commutators on \ell_{p_1}\oplus\ell_{p_2}\oplus...\oplus\ell_{p_n} is given. We also show that strictly singular operators on \ell_{\infty} are commutators.
