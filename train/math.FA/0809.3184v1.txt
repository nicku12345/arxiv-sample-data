Let T be a C_0--contraction on a separable Hilbert space. We assume that I_H-T^*T is compact. For a function f holomorphic in the unit disk \DD and continuous on \bar\DD, we show that f(T) is compact if and only if f vanishes on \sigma (T)\cap \TT, where \sigma (T) is the spectrum of T and \TT the unit circle. If f is just a bounded holomorphic function on \DD we prove that f(T) is compact if and only if \lim_{n\to \infty} T^nf(T) =0.
