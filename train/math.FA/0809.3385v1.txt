For a,\alpha>0 let E(a,\alpha) be the set of all compact operators A on a separable Hilbert space such that s_n(A)=O(\exp(-an^\alpha)), where s_n(A) denotes the n-th singular number of A. We provide upper bounds for the norm of the resolvent (zI-A)^{-1} of A in terms of a quantity describing the departure from normality of A and the distance of z to the spectrum of A. As a consequence we obtain upper bounds for the Hausdorff distance of the spectra of two operators in E(a,\alpha).
