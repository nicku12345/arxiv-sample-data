We construct an algebra of generalized functions ^*\mathcal{E}(\mathbb{R}^d). We also construct an embedding of the space of Schwartz distributions \mathcal{D}^\prime(\mathbb{R}^d) into ^*\mathcal{E}(\mathbb{R}^d) and thus present a solution of the problem of multiplication of Schwartz distributions which improves J.F. Colombeau's solution. As an application we prove the existence of a weak delta-like solution in {^*\mathcal{E}(\mathbb{R}^d)} of the Hopf equation. This solution does not have a counterpart in the classical theory of partial differential equations. Our result improves a similar result by M. Radyna obtained in the framework of perturbation theory.
