Frames for Fr\'echet spaces X_F with respect to Fr\'echet sequence spaces \Theta_F are studied and conditions, implying series expansions in X_F and X_F^*, are determined. If \{g_i\} is a \Theta_0-frame for X_0, we construct a sequence \{X_s\}_{s\in {\mathbb N}_0}, X_s\subset X_{s-1}, s\in {\mathbb N}, for given \Theta_F, respectively a sequence \{\Theta_s\}_{s\in {\mathbb N}_0}, \Theta_s\subset \Theta_{s-1}, s\in {\mathbb N}, for given X_F, so that \{g_i\} is a pre-F-frame (or F-frame) for X_F with respect to \Theta_F under different assumptions given on X_0, \Theta_0, \Theta_F or X_0, \Theta_0, X_F.
