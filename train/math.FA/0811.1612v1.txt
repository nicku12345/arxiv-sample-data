Let \ell^p, 1\le p\le \infty, be the space of all p-summable sequences and C_a be the convolution operator associated with a summable sequence a. It is known that the \ell^p- stability of the convolution operator C_a for different 1\le p\le \infty are equivalent to each other, i.e., if C_a has \ell^p-stability for some 1\le p\le \infty then C_a has \ell^q-stability for all 1\le q\le \infty. In the study of spline approximation, wavelet analysis, time-frequency analysis, and sampling, there are many localized operators of non-convolution type whose stability is one of the basic assumptions. In this paper, we consider the stability of those localized operators including infinite matrices in the Sj\"ostrand class, synthesis operators with generating functions enveloped by shifts of a function in the Wiener amalgam space, and integral operators with kernels having certain regularity and decay at infinity. We show that the \ell^p- stability (or L^p-stability) of those three classes of localized operators are equivalent to each other, and we also prove that the left inverse of those localized operators are well localized.
