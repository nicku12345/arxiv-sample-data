Let B_Y denote the unit ball of a normed linear space Y. A symmetric, bounded, closed, convex set A in a finite dimensional normed linear space X is called a {\it sufficient enlargement} for X if, for an arbitrary isometric embedding of X into a Banach space Y, there exists a linear projection P:Y\to X such that P(B_Y)\subset A. The main results of the paper: {\bf (1)} Each minimal-volume sufficient enlargement is linearly equivalent to a zonotope spanned by multiples of columns of a totally unimodular matrix. {\bf (2)} If a finite dimensional normed linear space has a minimal-volume sufficient enlargement which is not a parallelepiped, then it contains a two-dimensional subspace whose unit ball is linearly equivalent to a regular hexagon.
