We study Banach \widetilde{\mathbb C}-algebras, i.e., complete ultra-pseudo-normed algebras over the ring \widetilde{\mathbb C} of Colombeau generalized complex numbers. We develop a spectral theory in such algebras. We show by explicit examples that important parts of classical Banach algebra theory do not hold for general Banach \widetilde{\mathbb C}-algebras and indicate a particular class of Banach \widetilde{\mathbb C}-algebras that overcomes these limitations to a large extent. We also investigate C*-algebras over \widetilde{\mathbb C}.
