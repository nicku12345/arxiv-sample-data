A class of subharmonic functions are proved to have the growth estimates   u(x)= o(x_n^{1-\frac{\alpha}{p}}|x|^{\frac{\gamma}{p}+\frac{n-1}{q}-n+\frac{\alpha}{p}}) at infinity in the upper half space of {\bf R}^{n}, which generalizes the growth properties of analytic functions and harmonic functions.
