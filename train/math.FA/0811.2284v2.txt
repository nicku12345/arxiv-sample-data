Let X and Y be Banach spaces and (\Omega,\Sigma,\mu) a finite measure space. In this note we introduce the space L^p[\mu;L(X,Y)] consisting of all (equivalence classes of) functions \Phi:\Omega \mapsto L(X,Y) such that \omega \mapsto \Phi(\omega)x is strongly \mu-measurable for all x\in X and \omega \mapsto \Phi(\omega)f(\omega) belongs to L^1(\mu;Y) for all f\in L^{p'}(\mu;X), 1/p+1/p'=1. We show that functions in L^p[\mu;\L(X,Y)] define operator-valued measures with bounded p-variation and use these spaces to obtain an isometric characterization of the space of all L(X,Y)-valued multipliers acting boundedly from L^p(\mu;X) into L^q(\mu;Y), 1\le q< p<\infty.
