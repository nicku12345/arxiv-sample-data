By using the notion of contraction of Lie groups, we transfer L^p-L^2 estimates for joint spectral projectors from the unit complex sphere \sfera in {{\mathbb{C}}}^{n+1} to the reduced Heisenberg group h^{n}. In particular, we deduce some estimates recently obtained by H. Koch and F. Ricci on h^n. As a consequence, we prove, in the spirit of Sogge's work, a discrete restriction theorem for the sub-Laplacian L on h^n.
