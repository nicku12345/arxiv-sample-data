System of semilinear ordinary differential equation and fractional differential equation of distributed order is investigated and solved in a mild and classical sense. Such a system arises as a distributed derivative model of viscoelasticity and in the system identfica- tion theory. Also, the existence and uniqueness of a solution to a general linear fractional differential equation in the space of tempered distributions is given.
