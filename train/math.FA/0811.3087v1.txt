In this paper we study the L^p-convergence of the Riesz means for the sublaplacian on the sphere S^{2n-1} in the complex n-dimensional space C^n. We show that the Riesz means of order delta of a function f converge to f in L^p(S^{2n-1}) when delta>delta(p):=(2n-1)|1\2-1\p|. The index delta(p) improves the one found by Alexopoulos and Lohoue', 2n|1\2-1\p|, and it coincides with the one found by Mauceri and, with different methods, by Mueller in the case of sublaplacian on the Heisenberg group.
