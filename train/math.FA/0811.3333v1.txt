We define a scale of L^q Carleson norms, all of which characterize the membership of a function in BMO. The phenomenon is analogous to the John-Nirenberg inequality, but on the level of Carleson measures. The classical Carleson condition corresponds to the L^2 case in our theory.   The result is applied to give a new proof for the L^p-boundedness of paraproducts with a BMO symbol. A novel feature of the argument is that all p are covered at once in a completely interpolation-free manner. This is achieved by using the L^1 Carleson norm, and indicates the usefulness of this notion. Our approach is chosen so that all these results extend in a natural way to the case of X-valued functions, where X is a Banach space with the UMD property.
