Semiuniform semigroups provide a natural setting for the convolution of generalized finite measures on semigroups. A semiuniform semigroup is said to be ambitable if each uniformly bounded uniformly equicontinuous set of functions on the semigroup is contained in an ambit. In the convolution algebras constructed over ambitable semigroups, topological centres have a tractable characterization.
