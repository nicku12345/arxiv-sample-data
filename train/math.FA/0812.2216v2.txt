In order to measure qualitative properties we introduce a notion of a type for arbitrary normed spaces which measures the worst possible growth of partial sums of sequences weakly converging to zero. The ideas can be traced back to Banach and Mazur who used this type to compare the so-called linear dimension of classical Banach spaces. As an application we compare the linear dimension and investigate isomorphy of some classical Banach spaces.
