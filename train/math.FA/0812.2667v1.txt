A Banach space operator T\in B({\cal X}) is polaroid if points \lambda\in\iso\sigma\sigma(T) are poles of the resolvent of T. Let \sigma_a(T), \sigma_w(T), \sigma_{aw}(T), \sigma_{SF_+}(T) and \sigma_{SF_-}(T) denote, respectively, the approximate point, the Weyl, the Weyl essential approximate, the upper semi--Fredholm and lower semi--Fredholm spectrum of T. For A, B and C\in B({\cal X}), let M_C denote the operator matrix (A & C 0 & B). If A is polaroid on \pi_0(M_C)=\{\lambda\in\iso\sigma(M_C) 0<\dim(M_C-\lambda)^{-1}(0)<\infty\}, M_0 satisfies Weyl's theorem, and A and B satisfy either of the hypotheses (i) A has SVEP at points \lambda\in\sigma_w(M_0)\setminus\sigma_{SF_+}(A) and B has SVEP at points \mu\in\sigma_w(M_0)\setminus\sigma_{SF_-}(B), or, (ii) both A and A^* have SVEP at points \lambda\in\sigma_w(M_0)\setminus\sigma_{SF_+}(A), or, (iii) A^* has SVEP at points \lambda\in\sigma_w(M_0)\setminus\sigma_{SF_+}(A) and B^* has SVEP at points \mu\in\sigma_w(M_0)\setminus\sigma_{SF_-}(B), then \sigma(M_C)\setminus\sigma_w(M_C)=\pi_0(M_C). Here the hypothesis that \lambda\in\pi_0(M_C) are poles of the resolvent of A can not be replaced by the hypothesis \lambda\in\pi_0(A) are poles of the resolvent of A.   For an operator T\in B(\X), let \pi_0^a(T)=\{\lambda:\lambda\in\iso\sigma_a(T), 0<\dim(T-\lambda)^{-1}(0)<\infty\}. We prove that if A^* and B^* have SVEP, A is polaroid on \pi_0^a(\M) and B is polaroid on \pi_0^a(B), then \sigma_a(\M)\setminus\sigma_{aw}(\M)=\pi_0^a(\M).
