Let n\in \Bbb N, and let A,B be two rings. An additive map h: A\to B is called n-Jordan homomorphism if h(a^n)=(h(a))^n for all a \in {A}. Every Jordan homomorphism is an n-Jordan homomorphism, for all n\geq 2, but the converse is false, in general. In this paper we investigate the n-Jordan homomorphisms on Banach algebras. Indeed some results related to continuity are given as well.
