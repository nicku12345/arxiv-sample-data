Let A,B be two rings and let  X be an  A-module. An additive map h: A\to B is called n-ring homomorphism if h(\Pi^n_{i=1}a_i)=\Pi^n_{i=1}h(a_i), for all a_1,a_2, ...,a_n \in {A}. An additive map D: A\to X is called n-ring derivation if D(\Pi^n_{i=1}a_i)=D(a_1)a_2... a_n+a_1D(a_2)a_3... a_n+... +a_1a_2... a_{n-1}D(a_n), for all a_1,a_2, ...,a_n \in {\mathcal A}. In this paper we investigate the Hyers-Ulam-Rassias stability of n-ring homomorphisms and n-ring derivations.
