The purpose of this article is to define a capacity on certain topological measure spaces X with respect to certain function spaces V consisting of measurable functions. In this general theory we will not fix the space V but we emphasize that V can be the classical Sobolev space W^{1,p}(\Omega), the classical Orlicz-Sobolev space W^{1,\Phi}(\Omega), the Haj{\l}asz-Sobolev space M^{1,p}(\Omega), the Musielak-Orlicz-Sobolev space (or generalized Orlicz-Sobolev space) and many other spaces. Of particular interest is the space V:=\tW^{1,p}(\Omega) given as the closure of W^{1,p}(\Omega)\cap C_c(\overline\Omega) in W^{1,p}(\Omega). In this case every function u\in V (a priori defined only on \Omega) has a trace on the boundary \partial\Omega which is unique up to a \Cap_{p,\Omega}-polar set.
