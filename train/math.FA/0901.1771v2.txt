Motivated by applications to transition semigroups, we introduce the notion of a norming dual pair and study a Pettis-type integral on such pairs. In particular, we establish a sufficient condition for integrability. We also introduce and study a class of semigroups on such dual pairs which are an abstract version of transition semigroups. Using our results, we give conditions ensuring that a semigroup consisting of kernel operators has a Laplace transform which also consists of kernel operators. We also provide conditions under which a semigroup is uniquely determined by its Laplace transform.
