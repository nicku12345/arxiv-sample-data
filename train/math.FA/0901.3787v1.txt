In this paper, using the group-like property of local inverses of a finite Blaschke product \phi, we will show that the largest C^*-algebra in the commutant of the multiplication operator M_{\phi} by \phi on the Bergman space is finite dimensional, and its dimension equals the number of connected components of the Riemann surface of \phi^{-1}\circ\phi  over the unit disk. If the order of the Blaschke product \phi is less than or equal to eight, then every C^*-algebra contained in the commutant of M_{\phi} is abelian and hence the number of minimal reducing subspaces of M_{\phi} equals the number of connected components of the Riemann surface of \phi^{-1}\circ\phi  over the unit disk.
