The behavior of the volume of the tube of distance r, around a given compact set M, is an old and important question with relations to many fields, like differential geometry, geometric measure theory, integral geometry, and also probability and statistics. Federer (1959) introduces the class of sets with positive reach, for which the volume is given by a polynom in r. For applications, in numerical analysis and statistics for example, an almost polynomial behavior is of equal interest. We exhibit an example showing how far to a polynom can be the volume of the tube, for the simplest extension of the class of sets with positive reach, namely the class of locally finite union of sets with positive reach satisfying a tangency condition introduced by Zahle (1984).
