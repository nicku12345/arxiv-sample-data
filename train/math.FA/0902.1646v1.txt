We provide a characterization of the Banach spaces X with a Schauder basis (e_n)_{n\in\mathbb{N}} which have the property that the dual space X^* is naturally isomorphic to the space \mathcal{L}_{diag}(X) of diagonal operators with respect to (e_n)_{n\in\mathbb{N}} . We also construct a Hereditarily Indecomposable Banach space {\mathfrak X}_D with a Schauder basis (e_n)_{n\in\mathbb{N}} such that {\mathfrak X}^*_D is isometric to \mathcal{L}_{diag}({\mathfrak X}_D) with these Banach algebras being Hereditarily Indecomposable. Finally, we show that every T\in \mathcal{L}_{diag}({\mathfrak X}_D) is of the form T=\lambda I+K, where K is a compact operator.
