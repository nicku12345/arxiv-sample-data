Based on the recently introduced uniform \lambda-adjustment for closed subspaces of Banach spaces we extend the concept of the strictly singular and finitely strictly singular operators to the sequences of closed subspaces and operators in Banach spaces and prove theorems about lower semi--Fredholm stability. We also state some new open questions related to strict singularity and the geometry of Banach spaces.
