We study those Banach spaces X for which S_X does not admit a finite \eps-net consisting of elements of S_X for any \eps < 2. We give characterisations of this class of spaces in terms of \ell_1-type sequences and in terms of the almost Daugavet property. The main result of the paper is: a separable Banach space X is isomorphic to a space from this class if and only if X contains an isomorphic copy of \ell_1.
