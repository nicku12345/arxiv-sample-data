We study continuity and equicontinuity of semigroups on norming dual pairs with respect to topologies defined in terms of the duality. In particular, we address the question whether continuity of a semigroup already implies (local/quasi) equicontinuity. We apply our results to transition semigroups and show that, under suitable hypothesis on E, every transition semigroup on C_b(E) which is continuous with respect to the strict topology \beta_0 is automatically quasi-equicontinuous with respect to that topology. We also give several characterizations of \beta_0-continuous semigroups on C_b(E) and provide a convenient condition for the transition semigroup of a Banach space valued Markov process to be \beta_0-continuous.
