We find conditions under which two measure preserving actions of two groups on the same space have a common fundamental domain. Our results apply to commuting actions with separate fundamental domains, lattices in groups of polynomial growth, and some semidirect products. We prove that two lattices of equal co-volume in a group of polynomial growth, one acting on the left, the other on the right, have a common fundamental domain.
