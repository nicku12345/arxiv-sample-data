The well-known Kolmogorov compactness criterion is extended to the case of variable exponent Lebesgue spaces L^{p(\cdot)}({\Omega}), where \Omega is a bounded open set in \mathbb R^n and p(\cdot) satisfies some "standard" conditions. Our final result should be called Kolmogorov-Tulajkov Sudakov compactness criterion, since it includes the case p_-=1 and requires only the "uniform" condition.
