In 1931 Bohnenblust and Hille proved that for each m-homogeneous polynomial \sum_{|\alpha| = m} a_\alpha z^\alpha on \C^n the \ell^{\frac{2m}{m+1}}-norm of its coefficients is bounded from above by a constant C_m (depending only on the degree m) times the sup norm of the polynomial on the polydisc \mathbb{D}^n. We prove that this inequality is hypercontractive in the sense that the optimal constant C_m is \leq C^m where C \geq 1 is an absolute constant. From this we derive that the Bohr radius K_n of the n-dimensional polydisc in \mathbb{C}^n is up to an absolute constant \geq \sqrt{\log n/n}; this result was independently and with a differnt proof discovered by Ortega-Cerd{\`a}, Ouna\"ies and Seip. An alternative approach even allows to prove that the Bohr radius K_n^p, 1 \leq p \leq \infty  of the unit ball of \ell_n^p , is asymptotically  \geq (\log n/n) ^{1-1/ \min (p,2)}. This shows that the upper bounds for K_n^p given by Boas and Khavinson are optimal.
