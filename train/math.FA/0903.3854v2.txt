Let Z(Ann(r,R)) be the class of all continuous functions f on the annulus Ann(r,R) in \mathbb C^n with twisted spherical mean f \times \mu_s(z)=0, whenever z\in \mathbb C^n and s >0 satisfy the condition that the sphere S_s(z)\subseteq Ann(r, R)  and ball B_r(0)\subseteq B_s(z). In this paper, we give a characterization for functions in Z(Ann(r,R)) in terms of their spherical harmonic coefficients. We also prove support theorems for the twisted spherical means in \mathbb C^n which improve some of the earlier results.
