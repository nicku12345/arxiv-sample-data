Let G be a locally compact group, and consider the weakly-almost periodic functionals on M(G), the measure algebra of G, denoted by \wap(M(G)). This is a C^*-subalgebra of the commutative C^*-algebra M(G)^*, and so has character space, say K_\wap. In this paper, we investigate properties of K_\wap. We present a short proof that K_\wap can naturally be turned into a semigroup whose product is separately continuous: at the Banach algebra level, this product is simply the natural one induced by the Arens products. This is in complete agreement with the classical situation when G is discrete. A study of how K_\wap is related to G is made, and it is shown that K_\wap is related to the weakly-almost periodic compactification of the discretisation of G. Similar results are shown for the space of almost periodic functionals on M(G).
