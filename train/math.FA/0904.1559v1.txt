Let G_0=K\ltimes\mathfrak p be the Cartan motion group associated with a noncompact semisimple Riemannian symmetric pair (G, K). Let \frak a be a maximal abelian subspace of \mathfrak p and let \p=\a+\q be the corresponding orthogonal decomposition. A flat horocycle in \p is a G_0-translate of \q. A conical distribution on the space \Xi_0 of flat horocycles is an eigendistribution of the algebra \mathbb D(\Xi_0) of G_0-invariant differential operators on \Xi_0 which is invariant under the left action of the isotropy subgroup of G_0 fixing \q. We prove that the space of conical distributions belonging to each generic eigenspace of \mathbb D(\Xi_0) is one-dimensional, and we classify the set of all conical distributions on \Xi_0 when G/K has rank one.
