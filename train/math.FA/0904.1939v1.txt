Let A and B be unital semisimple commutative Banach algebras and T a map from the invertible group A^{-1} onto B^{-1}. Linearity and multiplicativity of the map are not assumed. We consider the hypotheses on T: (1) \sigma (TfTg)=\sigma (fg); (2) \sigma_{\pi}(TfTg-\alpha)\cap \sigma_{\pi}(fg-\alpha)\ne \emptyset; (3) \mathrm{r} (TfTg-\alpha )=\mathrm{r}(fg-\alpha) hold for some non-zero complex number \alpha and for every f, g\in A^{-1}, where \sigma (\cdot) (resp. \sigma_{\pi}(\cdot)) denotes the (resp. peripheral) spectrum and \rr(\cdot) denotes the spectral radius. Under each of the hypotheses we show representations for T and under additional assumptions we show that T is extended to an algebra isomorphism. In particular, if T is a surjective group homomorphism such that T preserves the spectrum or T is a surjective isometry with respect to the spectral radius, then T is extended to an algebra isomorphism. Similar results holds for maps from A onto B.
