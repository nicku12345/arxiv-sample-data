We show that if T is an isometry (as metric spaces) from an open subgroup of the group of the invertible elements in a unital semisimple commutative Banach algebra onto an open subgroup of the group of the invertible elements in a unital Banach algebra, then T(1)^{-1}T is an isometrical group isomorphism. In particular, T(1)^{-1}T is extended to an isometrical real algebra isomorphism from A onto B.
