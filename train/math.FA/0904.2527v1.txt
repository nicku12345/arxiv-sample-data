We study the composition operators on an algebra of Dirichlet series, the analogue of the Wiener algebra of absolutely convergent Taylor series, which we call the Wiener-Dirichlet algebra. The central issue is to understand the connection between the properties of the operator and of its symbol, with special emphasis on the compact, automorphic, or isometric character of this operator. We are led to the intermediate study of algebras of functions of several, or countably many, complex variables.
