Under the standard assumptions on the variable exponent p(x) (log- and decay conditions), we give a characterization of the variable exponent Bessel potential space \mathfrak B^\alpha[L^{p(\cdot)}(\mathbb R^n)] in terms of the rate of convergence of the Poisson semigroup P_t. We show that the existence of the Riesz fractional derivative \mathbb{D}^\al f in the space L^{p(\cdot)}(\rn) is equivalent to the existence of the limit \frac{1}{\ve^\al}(I-P_\ve)^\al f. In the pre-limiting case \sup_x p(x)<\frac{n}{\al} we show that the Bessel potential space is characterized by the condition \|(I-P_\ve)^\al f\|_{p(\cdot)}\leqq C \ve^\al
