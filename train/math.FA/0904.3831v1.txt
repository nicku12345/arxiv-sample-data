Counterexamples are presented to weighted forms of the Weiss conjecture in discrete and continuous time. In particular, for certain ranges of \alpha, operators are constructed that satisfy a given resolvent estimate, but fail to be \alpha-admissible. For \alpha \in (-1,0) the operators constructed are normal, while for \alpha \in (0,1) the operator is the unilateral shift on the Hardy space H^2(\mathbb{D}).
