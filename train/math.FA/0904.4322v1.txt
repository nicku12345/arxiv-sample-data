It is shown that the right shift semigroup on L^2(\mathbb{R}_+) does not satisfy the weighted Weiss conjecture for \alpha \in (0,1). In other words, \alpha-admissibility of scalar valued observation operators cannot always be characterised by a simple resolvent growth condition. This result is in contrast to the unweighted case, where 0-admissibility can be characterised by a simple growth bound. The result is proved by providing a link between discrete and continuous \alpha-admissibility and then translating a counterexample for the unilateral shift on H^2(\mathbb{D}) to continuous time systems.
