Redundancy is the qualitative property which makes Hilbert space frames so useful in practice. However, developing a meaningful quantitative notion of redundancy for infinite frames has proven elusive. Though quantitative candidates for redundancy exist, the main open problem is whether a frame with redundancy greater than one contains a subframe with redundancy arbitrarily close to one. We will answer this question in the affirmative for \ell^1-localized frames. We then specialize our results to Gabor multi-frames with generators in M^1(\R^d), and Gabor molecules with envelopes in W(C,l^1). As a main tool in this work, we show there is a universal function g(x) so that for every \epsilon>0, every Parseval frame \{f_i\}_{i=1}^M for an N-dimensional Hilbert space H_N has a subset of fewer than (1+\epsilon)N elements which is a frame for H_N with lower frame bound g(\epsilon/(2\frac{M}{N}-1)). This work provides the first meaningful quantative notion of redundancy for a large class of infinite frames. In addition, the results give compelling new evidence in support of a general definition of reudndancy given in [7].
