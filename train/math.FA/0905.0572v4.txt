Given a finite set \sigma of the unit disc \mathbb{D} and a holomorphic function f in \mathbb{D} which belongs to a class X we are looking for a function g in another class Y which minimizes the norm |g|_{Y} among all functions g such that g_{|\sigma}=f_{|\sigma}. Generally speaking, the interpolation constant considered is c(\sigma,\, X,\, Y)={sup}{}_{f\in X,\,\parallel f\parallel_{X}\leq1}{inf}\{|g|_{Y}:\, g_{|\sigma}=f_{|\sigma}\} \,. When Y=H^{\infty}, our interpolation problem includes those of Nevanlinna-Pick (1916), Caratheodory-Schur (1908). Moreover, Carleson's free interpolation (1958) has also an interpretation in terms of our constant c(\sigma,\, X,\, H^{\infty}).} If X is a Hilbert space belonging to the scale of Hardy and Bergman weighted spaces, we show that c(\sigma,\, X,\, H^{\infty})\leq a\phi_{X}(1-\frac{1-r}{n}) where n=#\sigma, r={max}{}_{\lambda\in\sigma}|\lambda| and where \phi_{X}(t) stands for the norm of the evaluation functional f\mapsto f(t) on the space X. The upper bound is sharp over sets \sigma with given n and r.} If X is a general Hardy-Sobolev space or a general weighted Bergman space (not necessarily of Hilbert type), we also found upper and lower bounds for c(\sigma,\, X,\, H^{\infty}) (sometimes for special sets \sigma) but with some gaps between these bounds.} This constrained interpolation is motivated by some applications in matrix analysis and in operator theory.}
