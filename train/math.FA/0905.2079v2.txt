The main goal of this note is to establish a connection between the cotype of the Banach space X and the parameters r for which every 2-homogeneous polynomial on X is r-dominated. Let cotX be the infimum of the cotypes assumed by X and (cotX)* be its conjugate. The main result of this note asserts that if cotX > 2, then for every 1<= r < (cotX)* there exists a non-r-dominated 2-homogeneous polynomial on X.
