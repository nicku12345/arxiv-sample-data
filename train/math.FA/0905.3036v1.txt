We consider the X-Greedy Algorithm and the Dual Greedy Algorithm in a finite-dimensional Banach space with a strictly monotone basis as the dictionary. We show that when the dictionary is an initial segment of the Haar basis in L_p[0,1] (1 < p < \infty) then the algorithms terminate after finitely many iterations and that the number of iterations is bounded by a function of the length of the initial segment. We also prove a more general result for a class of strictly monotone bases.
