We establish L^p-boundedness for a class of operators that are given by convolution with product kernels adapted to curves in the space. The L^p bounds follow from the decomposition of the adapted kernel into a sum of two kernels with sigularities concentrated respectively on a coordinate plane and along the curve. The proof of the L^p-estimates for the two corresponding operators involves Fourier analysis techniques and some algebraic tools, namely the Bernstein-Sato polynomials.
