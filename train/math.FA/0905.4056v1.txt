In this note, we study maximal monotonicity of linear relations (set-valued operators with linear graphs) on reflexive Banach spaces. We provide a new and simpler proof of a result due to Brezis-Browder which states that a monotone linear relation with closed graph is maximal monotone if and only if its adjoint is monotone. We also study Fitzpatrick functions and give an explicit formula for Fitzpatrick functions of order n for monotone symmetric linear relations.
