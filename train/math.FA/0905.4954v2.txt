We investigate the lifting property of modulation spaces and construct explicit isomorpisms between them. For each weight function \omega and suitable window function \fy , the Toeplitz operator (or localization operator) \tp_\fy (\omega) is an isomorphism from M^{p,q}_{(\omega_0)} onto M^{p,q}_{(\omega_0/\omega)} for every p,q \in [1,\infty ] and arbitrary weight function \omega_0. The methods involve the pseudo-differential calculus of Bony and Chemin and the Wiener algebra property of certain symbol classes of pseudo-differential operators.
