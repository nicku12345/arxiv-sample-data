Let X and Y be completely regular spaces and E and F be Hausdorff topological vector spaces. We call a linear map T from a subspace of C(X,E) into C(Y,F) a \emph{Banach-Stone map} if it has the form Tf(y) = S_{y}(f(h(y)) for a family of linear operators S_{y} : E \to F, y \in Y, and a function h: Y \to X. In this paper, we consider maps having the property:   \cap^{k}_{i=1}Z(f_{i}) \neq\emptyset\iff\cap^{k}_{i=1}Z(Tf_{i}) \neq \emptyset, where Z(f) = \{f = 0\}. We characterize linear bijections with property (Z) between spaces of continuous functions, respectively, spaces of differentiable functions (including C^{\infty}), as Banach-Stone maps. In particular, we confirm a conjecture of Ercan and \"Onal: Suppose that X and Y are realcompact spaces and E and F are Hausdorff topological vector lattices (respectively, C^{*}-algebras). Let T: C(X,E) \to C(Y,F) be a vector lattice isomorphism (respectively, *-algebra isomorphism) such that Z(f) \neq\emptyset\iff Z(Tf) \neq\emptyset. Then X is homeomorphic to Y and E is lattice isomorphic (respectively, C^{*}-isomorphic) to F. Some results concerning the continuity of T are also obtained.
