Let 1\le p <\infty, f\in L_p(\real) and \Lambda\subseteq \real. We consider the closed subspace of L_p(\real), X_p (f,\Lambda), generated by the set of translations f_{(\lambda)} of f by \lambda \in\Lambda. If p=1 and \{f_{(\lambda)} :\lambda\in\Lambda\} is a bounded minimal system in L_1(\real), we prove that X_1 (f,\Lambda) embeds almost isometrically into \ell_1. If \{f_{(\lambda)} :\lambda\in\Lambda\} is an unconditional basic sequence in L_p(\real), then \{f_{(\lambda)} : \lambda\in\Lambda\} is equivalent to the unit vector basis of \ell_p for 1\le p\le 2 and X_p (f,\Lambda) embeds into \ell_p if 2<p\le 4. If p>4, there exists f\in L_p(\real) and \Lambda \subseteq \zed so that \{f_{(\lambda)} :\lambda\in\Lambda\} is unconditional basic and L_p(\real) embeds isomorphically into X_p (f,\Lambda).
