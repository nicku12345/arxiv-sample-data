In this paper, we introduce the new concepts of subcompatibility and subsequential continuity which are respectively weaker than occasionally weak compatibilty and reciprocal continuity. With them, we establish several common fixed point theorems which extend corresponding results of Jungck and Rhoades (2006), Djoudi and Nisse (2003) and Mbarki (2002).
