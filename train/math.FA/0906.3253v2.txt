We study tensor norms that destroy unconditionality in the following sense: for every Banach space E with unconditional basis, the n-fold tensor product of E (with the corresponding tensor norm) does not have unconditional basis. We establish an easy criterion to check weather a tensor norm destroys unconditionality or not. Using this test we get that all injective and projective tensor norms different from \varepsilon and \pi destroy unconditionality, both in full and symmetric tensor products. We present applications to polynomial ideals: we show that many usual polynomial ideals never enjoy the Gordon-Lewis property. We also consider the unconditionality of the monomial basic sequence. Analogous problems for multilinear and operator ideals are addressed.
