Let X a Banach space and T a bounded linear operator on X. We denote by S(T) the set of all \lambda \in \cit such that T does not have the single-valued extension property at \lambda. In this note we prove equality up to S(T) between the left Drazin spectrum and the left B-Fredholm spectrum and between the semi-essential approximate point spectrum and the left Drazin spectrum. As applications we investigate generalized Weyl's theorem for operator matrices and multipliers operators.
