Let X and Y be compact Hausdorff spaces, and E, F be Banach lattices. Let C(X,E) denote the Banach lattice of all continuous E-valued functions on X equipped with the pointwise ordering and the sup norm. We prove that if there exists a Riesz isomorphism \mathnormal{\Phi}: C(X,E)\to C(Y,F) such that \mathnormal{\Phi}f is non-vanishing on Y if and only if f is non-vanishing on X, then X is homeomorphic to Y, and E is Riesz isomorphic to F. In this case, \mathnormal{\Phi} can be written as a weighted composition operator: \mathnormal{\Phi} f(y)=\mathnormal{\Pi}(y)(f(\varphi(y))), where \varphi is a homeomorphism from Y onto X, and \mathnormal{\Pi}(y) is a Riesz isomorphism from E onto F for every y in Y. This generalizes some known results obtained recently.
