Let X and Y be Banach spaces, A\in B(X), B\in B(Y), C\in B(Y, X), M_{C}=({cc}A&C 0&B) be the operator matrix acting on the Banach space X\oplus Y. In this paper, we give out 20 kind spectra structure of M_C, decide 18 kind spectra filling-in-hole properties of M_C, and present 10 examples to show that some conclusions about the spectra structure or filling-in-hole properties of M_C are not true.
