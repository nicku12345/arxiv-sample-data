This note corrects a gap and improves results in an earlier paper by the first named author.   More precisely, it is shown that on weakly compactly generated Banach spaces X which admit a C^{p} smooth norm, one can uniformly approximate uniformly continuous functions f:X->R by Lipschitz, C^{p} smooth functions. Moreover, there is a constant C>1 so that any L-Lipschitz function f:X->R can be uniformly approximated by CL-Lipschitz, C^{p} smooth functions.   This provides a `Lipschitz version' of the classical approximation results of Godefroy, Troyanski, Whitfield and Zizler.
