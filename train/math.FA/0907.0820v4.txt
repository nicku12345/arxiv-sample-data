In this article we develop the concepts of \sigma-relation and \sigma-function, following the same steps as in Set Theory. First we define the concept of ordered pair and then we build the Cartesian Product of \sigma-sets so that we can define the concepts of \sigma-relation and \sigma-function.   Now, as in \sigma-Set Theory there exist the concepts of \sigma-antielement and \sigma-antiset, we can build the new concepts of \sigma-antifunction, antidentity and antinverse. Finally, in the case that a \sigma-function f:A\to B is bijective and there exist A^{\st} and B^{\st} \sigma-antiset of A and B, we get 16 different \sigma-functions which are related in a diagram of \sigma-functions.
