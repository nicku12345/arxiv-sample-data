Let n\in \Bbb N-\{1\}, and let A be a Banach algebra. An additive map D: A\to A is called n-Jordan derivation if D(a^n)=D(a)a^{n-1}+aD(a)a^{n-2}+...+a^{n-2}D(a)a+a^{n-1}D(a), for all a \in {A}. Using fixed point methods, we investigate the stability of n--Jordan derivations (n--Jordan ^*-derivations) on Banach algebras (C^*-algebras). Also we show that to each approximate ^*-Jordan derivation f in a C^*- algebra there corresponds a unique ^*-derivation near to f.
