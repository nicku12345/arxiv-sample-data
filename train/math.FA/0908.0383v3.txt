In this paper, we unify the theory of SSD spaces and the theory of strongly representable sets, and we apply our results to the theory of the various classes of maximally monotone sets. In particular, we prove that type (ED), dense type, type (D), type (NI) and strongly representable are equivalent concepts and, consequently, that the known properties of strongly representable sets follow from known properties of sets of type (ED).
