We give sufficient conditions on an asymptotic \ell_p (for 1 < p < \infty) Banach space which ensure the space admits an operator which is not a compact perturbation of a multiple of the identity. These conditions imply the existence of strictly singular non-compact operators on the HI spaces constructed by G. Androulakis and the author and by I. Deliyanni and A. Manoussakis. Additionally we show that under these same conditions on the space X, \ell_\infty embeds isomorphically into the space of bounded linear operators on X.
