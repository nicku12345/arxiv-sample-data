Let K be a commutative compact hypergroup and L^1(K) the hypergroup algebra. We show that L^1(K) is amenable if and only if \pi_K, the Plancherel weight on the dual space \widehat{K}, is bounded. Furthermore, we show that if K is an infinite discrete hypergroup and there exists \alpha\in \widehat{K} which vanishes at infinity, then L^1(K) is not amenable. In particular, L^1(K) fails to be even \alpha-left amenable if \pi_K(\{\alpha\})=0.
