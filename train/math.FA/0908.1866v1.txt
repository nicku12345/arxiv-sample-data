In this paper, we show a parabolic version of the Ogawa type inequality in Sobolev spaces. Our inequality provides an estimate of the L^{\infty} norm of a function in terms of its parabolic BMO norm, with the aid of the square root of the logarithmic dependency of a higher order Sobolev norm. The proof is mainly based on the Littlewood-Paley decomposition and a characterization of parabolic BMO spaces.
