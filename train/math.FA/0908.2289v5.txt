Let Z_{r,R} be the class of all continuous functions f on the annulus \Ann(r,R) in the real hyperbolic space \mathbb B^n with spherical means M_sf(x)=0, whenever s>0 and x\in \mathbb B^n are such that the sphere S_s(x)\subset \Ann(r, R)  and B_r(o)\subseteq B_s(x). In this article, we give a characterization for functions in Z_{r,R}. In the case R=\infty, this result gives a new proof of Helgason's support theorem for spherical means in the real hyperbolic spaces.
