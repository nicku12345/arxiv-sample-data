In a recent work of the author, a parabolic extension of the elliptic Ogawa type inequality has been established. This inequality is originated from the Brezis-Gallouet-Wainger logarithmic type inequalities revealing Sobolev embeddings in the critical case. In this paper, we improve the parabolic version of Ogawa inequality by allowing it to cover not only the class of functions from Sobolev spaces, but the wider class of Holder continuous functions.
