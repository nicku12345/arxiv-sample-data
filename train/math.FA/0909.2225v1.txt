Recent results have shown that any closed operator A commuting with the backwards shift S^* restricted to K ^2_u := H^2 \ominus u H^2, where u is an inner function, can be realized as a Nevanlinna function of S^*_u := S^* |_{K^2_u}, A = \varphi (S^*_u), where \varphi belongs to a certain class of Nevanlinna functions which depend on u. In this paper this result is generalized to show that given any contraction T of class C_0 (N), that any closed (and not necessarily bounded) operator A commuting with the commutant of T is equal to \varphi (T) where \varphi  belongs to a certain class of Nevanlinna functions which depend on the minimal inner function m_T of T.
