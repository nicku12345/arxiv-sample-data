For an increasing sequence (\omega_n) of algebra weights on \mathbb R^+ we study various properties of the Fr\'{e}chet algebra A(\omega)=\bigcap_n L^1(\omega_n) obtained as the intersection of the weighted Banach algebras L^1(\omega_n). We show that every endomorphism of A(\omega) is standard, if for all n\in\mathbb N there exists m\in\mathbb N such that \omega_m(t)/\omega_n(t)\to\infty as t\to\infty. Moreover, we characterise the continuous derivations on this algebra: If for all n\in\mathbb N there exists m\in\mathbb N such that t*\omega_n(t)/\omega_m(t) is bounded on \mathbb R^+, then the continuous derivations on A(\omega) are exactly the linear maps D of the form D(f)=(Xf)*\mu for f\in A(\omega), where \mu is a measure in B(\omega)=\bigcap_n M(\omega_n) and (Xf)(t)=tf(t) for t\in\mathbb R^+ and f\in A(\omega). If the condition is not satisfied, we show that A(\omega) has no non-zero derivations.
