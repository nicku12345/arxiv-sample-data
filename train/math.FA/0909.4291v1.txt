We show that the variational inequality VI(C,A) has a unique solution for a relaxed (\gamma, r)-cocoercive, \mu-Lipschitzian mapping A: C\to H with r>\gamma \mu^2, where C is a nonempty closed convex subset of a Hilbert space H. From this result, it can be derived that, for example, the recent algorithms given in the references of this paper, despite their becoming more complicated, are not general as they should be.
