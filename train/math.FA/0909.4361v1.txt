Let K be a convex body in \mathbb R^n. We introduce a new affine invariant, which we call \Omega_K, that can be found in three different ways: as a limit of normalized L_p-affine surface areas, as the relative entropy of the cone measure of K and the cone measure of K^\circ, as the limit of the volume difference of K and L_p-centroid bodies. We investigate properties of \Omega_K and of related new invariant quantities. In particular, we show new affine isoperimetric inequalities and we show a "information inequality" for convex bodies.
