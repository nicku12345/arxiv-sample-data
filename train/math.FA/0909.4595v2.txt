The goal of this paper is to study the Riesz transforms \na A^{-1/2} where A is the Schr\"odinger operator -\D-V, V\ge 0, under different conditions on the potential V. We prove that if V is strongly subcritical, \na A^{-1/2} is bounded on L^p(\R^N), N\ge3, for all p\in(p_0';2] where p_0' is the dual exponent of p_0 where 2<\frac{2N}{N-2}
