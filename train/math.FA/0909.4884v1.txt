The paper introduces a notion of the Laplace operator of a polynomial p in noncommutative variables x=(x_1,...,x_g). The Laplacian Lap[p,h] of p is a polynomial in x and in a noncommuting variable h. When all variables commute we have Lap[p,h]=h^2\Delta_x p where \Delta_x p is the usual Laplacian. A symmetric polynomial in symmetric variables will be called harmonic if Lap[p,h]=0 and subharmonic if the polynomial q(x,h):=Lap[p,h] takes positive semidefinite matrix values whenever matrices X_1,..., X_g, H are substituted for the variables x_1,...,x_g, h. In this paper we classify all homogeneous symmetric harmonic and subharmonic polynomials in two symmetric variables. We find there are not many of them: for example, the span of all such subharmonics of any degree higher than 4 has dimension 2 (if odd degree) and 3 (if even degree). Hopefully, the approach here will suggest ways of defining and analyzing other partial differential equations and inequalities.
