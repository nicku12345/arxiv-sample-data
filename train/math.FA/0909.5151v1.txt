If E is an operator space, the non-commutative vector valued L^p spaces S^p[E] have been defined by Pisier for any 1 \leq p \leq \infty. In this paper a necessary and sufficient condition for a Hankel matrix of the form (a_{i+j})_{0 \le i,j} with a_k \in E to be bounded in S^p[E] is established. This extends previous results of Peller where E=\C or E=S^p. The main theorem states that if 1 \leq p < \infty, (a_{i+j})_{0 \le i,j} is bounded in S^p[E] if and only if there is an analytic function \phi in the vector valued Besov Space B_p^{1/p}(E) such that a_n = \hat \phi(n) for all n \in \N. In particular this condition only depends on the Banach space structure of E. We also show that the norm of the isomorphism \phi \mapsto (\hat \phi(i+j))_{i,j} grows as \sqrt p as p \to \infty, and compute the norm of the natural projection onto the space of Hankel matrices.
