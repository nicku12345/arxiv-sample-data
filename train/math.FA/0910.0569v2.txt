In this paper we present an abstract framework for construction of Banach spaces of distributions from group representations. This generalizes the theory of coorbit spaces initiated by H.G. Feichtinger and K. Gr\"ochenig in the 1980's. Spaces that can be described by this new technique include the whole Banach-scale of Bergman spaces on the unit disc. For these Bergman spaces we show that atomic decompositions can be constructed through sampling. We further present a wavelet characterization of Besov spaces on the forward light cone.
