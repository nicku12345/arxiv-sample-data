For metric spaces X and Y, normed spaces E and F, and certain subspaces A(X,E) and A(Y,F) of vector-valued continuous functions, we obtain a complete characterization of linear and bijective maps T:A(X,E)\to A(Y,F) preserving common zeros, that is, maps satisfying the property \setcounter{equation}{15} \label{dub} Z(f)\cap Z(g)\neq \emptyset \Longleftrightarrow Z(Tf)\cap Z(Tg)\neq \emptyset for any f,g\in A(X,E), where Z(f)=\{x\in X:f(x)=0\}. Moreover, we provide some examples of subspaces for which the automatic continuity of linear bijections having the property (\ref{dub}) is derived.
