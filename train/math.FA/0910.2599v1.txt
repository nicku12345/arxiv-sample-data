In this work a possibility of a decomposition of a bounded operator which acts in a Hilbert space H as a product of a J-unitary and a J-self-adjoint operators is studied, J is a conjugation (an antilinear involution). Decompositions of J-unitary and unitary operators which are analogous to decompositions in the finite-dimensional case are obtained. A possibility of a matrix representation for J-symmetric, J-skew-symmetric operators is studied. Also, some simple properties of J-symmetric, J-antisymmetric, J-isometric operators are obtained, a structure of a null set for a J-form is studied.
