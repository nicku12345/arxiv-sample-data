We prove thatthe Banach space (\oplus_{n=1}^\infty \ell_p^n)_{\ell_q}, which is isomorphic to certain Besov spaces, has a greedy basis whenever 1\leq p \leq\infty and 1<q<\infty. Furthermore, the Banach spaces (\oplus_{n=1}^\infty \ell_p^n)_{\ell_1}, with 1<p\le \infty, and (\oplus_{n=1}^\infty \ell_p^n)_{c_0}, with 1\le p<\infty do not have a greedy bases. We prove as well that the space (\oplus_{n=1}^\infty \ell_p^n)_{\ell_q} has a 1-greedy basis if and only if 1\leq p=q\le \infty.
