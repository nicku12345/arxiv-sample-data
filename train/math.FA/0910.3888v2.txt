Given an homogeneous polynomial on a Banach space E belonging to some maximal or minimal polynomial ideal, we consider its iterated extension to an ultrapower of E and prove that this extension remains in the ideal and has the same ideal norm. As a consequence, we show that the Aron-Berner extension is a well defined isometry for any maximal or minimal ideal of homogeneous polynomials. This allow us to obtain symmetric versions of some basic results of the metric theory of tensor products.
