We construct a weak Hilbert Banach space such that for every block subspace Y every bounded linear operator on Y is of the form D+S where S is a strictly singular operator and D is a diagonal operator. We show that this yields a weak Hilbert space whose block subspaces are not isomorphic to any of their proper subspaces.
