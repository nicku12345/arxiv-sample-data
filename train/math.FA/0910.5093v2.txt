The characteristic function for a contraction is a classical complete unitary invariant devised by Sz.-Nagy and Foias. Just as a contraction is related to the Szego kernel k_S(z,w) = (1 - z\ow)^{-1} for |z|, |w| < 1, by means of (1/k_S)(T,T^*) \ge 0, we consider an arbitrary open connected domain \Omega in \BC^n, a complete Nevanilinna-Pick kernel k on \Omega and a tuple T = (T_1, ..., T_n) of commuting bounded operators on a complex separable Hilbert space \clh such that (1/k)(T,T^*) \ge 0. For a complete Pick kernel the 1/k functional calculus makes sense in a beautiful way. It turns out that the model theory works very well and a characteristic function can be associated with T. Moreover, the characteristic function then is a complete unitary invariant for a suitable class of tuples T.
