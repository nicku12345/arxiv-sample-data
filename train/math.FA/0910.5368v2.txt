We construct an analytic self-map \phi of the unit disk and an Orlicz function \Psi for which the composition operator of symbol \phi is compact on the Hardy-Orlicz space H^\Psi, but not compact on the Bergman-Orlicz space {\mathfrak B}^\Psi. For that, we first prove a Carleson embedding theorem, and then characterize the compactness of composition operators on Bergman-Orlicz spaces, in terms of Carleson function (of order 2). We show that this Carleson function is equivalent to the Nevanlinna counting function of order 2.
