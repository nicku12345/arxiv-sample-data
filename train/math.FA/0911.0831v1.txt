Let G be a locally compact abelian group and let \mu be a complex valued regular Borel measure on G. In this paper we consider a generalisation of a class of Banach lattices introduced in [6]. We use Laplace transform methods to show that the norm of a convolution operator with symbol \mu on such a space is bounded below by the L_\infty norm of the Fourier-Stieltjes transform of \mu. We also show that for any Banach lattice of locally integrable functions on G with a shift-invariant norm, the norm of a convolution operator with symbol \mu is bounded above by the total variation of \mu.
