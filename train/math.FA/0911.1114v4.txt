We give an elementary proof of a generalization of Bourgain and Tzafriri's Restricted Invertibility Theorem, which says roughly that any matrix with columns of unit length and bounded operator norm has a large coordinate subspace on which it is well-invertible. Our proof gives the tightest known form of this result, is constructive, and provides a deterministic polynomial time algorithm for finding the desired subspace.
