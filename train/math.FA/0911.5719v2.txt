Let (B_0,B_1) be a Banach pair. Stafney showed that one can replace the space F(B_0,B_1) with its subspace G(B_0,B_1) in the definition of the norm in the Calderon complex interpolation method on the strip if the element belongs to the intersection of the spaces B_i. We shall extend this result to a more general setting, which contains well-known interpolation methods: the Calderon complex interpolation method on the annulus, the Lions-Peetre real method (with several different choices of norms), and the Peetre "plus minus" method.
