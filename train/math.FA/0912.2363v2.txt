Certain signal classes such as audio signals call for signal representations with the ability to adapt to the signal's properties. In this article we introduce the new concept of quilted frames, which aim at adaptivity in time-frequency representations. As opposed to Gabor or wavelet frames, this new class of frames allows for the adaptation of the signal analysis to the local requirements of signals under consideration. Quilted frames are constructed directly in the time-frequency domain in a signal-adaptive manner. Validity of the frame property guarantees the possibility to reconstruct the original signal. The frame property is shown for specific situations and the Bessel property is proved for the general setting. Strategies for reconstruction from coefficients obtained with quilted Gabor frames and numerical simulations are provided as well.
