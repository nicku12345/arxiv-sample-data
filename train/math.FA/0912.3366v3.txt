We introduce global wave-front sets \operatorname{WF}_{{\mathcal B}} (f), f\in {\mathscr S}^\prime(\textbf{R}^d), with respect to suitable Banach or Fr\'echet spaces {\mathcal B}. An important special case is given by the modulation spaces {\mathcal B}=M(\omega,\mathscr B), where \omega is an appropriate weight function and \mathscr B is a translation invariant Banach function space. We show that the standard properties for known notions of wave-front set extend to \operatorname{WF}_{{\mathcal B}} (f). In particular, we prove that micro locality and microellipticity hold for a class of globally defined pseudo-differential operators \operatorname{Op}_t(a), acting continuously on the involved spaces.
