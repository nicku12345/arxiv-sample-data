Let S be an inverse semigroup with an upward directed set of idempotents E. In this paper we define the module topological center of second dual of a Banach algebra which is a Banach module over another Banach algebra with compatible actions, and find it for  \ell ^{1}(S)^{**} (as an \ell^{1}(E)-module). We also prove that  \ell ^{1}(S)^{**} is \ell^{1}(E)-module amenable if and only if an appropriate group homomorphic image of S is finite.
