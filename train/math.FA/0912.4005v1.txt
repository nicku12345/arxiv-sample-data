In this paper we define module biprojctivity and module biflatness for a Banach algebra which is a Banach module over another Banach algebra with compatible actions, and find their relation to classical biprojectivity and biflatness. As a typical example, We show that for an inverse semigroup S with an upward directed set of idempotents E, the semigroup algebra  \ell ^{1}(S), as an \ell ^{1}(E)-module, is module biprojective if and only if an appropriate group homomorphic image of S is finite. Also we show that \ell ^{1}(S) is module biflat if and only if S is amenable.
