We investigate the norm identity \|uC_\phi + T\| = \|u\|_\infty + \|T\| for classes of operators on C(S), where S is a compact Hausdorff space without isolated point, and characterize those weighted composition operators which satisfy this equation for every weakly compact operator T : C(S)\to C(S). We also give a characterization of such weighted composition operator acting on the disk algebra A(D).
