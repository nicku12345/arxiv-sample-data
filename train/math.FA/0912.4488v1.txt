In this paper we study the main properties of the Ces\`aro means of bi-continuous semigroups, introduced and studied by K\"{u}hnemund in [24]. We also give some applications to Feller semigroups generated by second-order elliptic differential operators with unbounded coefficients in C_b(\R^N) and to evolution operators associated with nonautonomous second-order differential operators in C_b(\R^N) with time-periodic coefficients.
