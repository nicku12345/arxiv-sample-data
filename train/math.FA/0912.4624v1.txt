Let S be an inverse semigroup with the set of idempotents E. In this paper we define the module super-amenability of a Banach algebra which is a Banach module over another Banach algebra with compatible actions, and show that when E is upward directed and acts on S trivially from left and by multiplication from right, the semigroup algebra  \ell ^{1}(S) is \ell^{1}(E)-module super-amenable if and only if an appropriate group homomorphic image of S is finite.
