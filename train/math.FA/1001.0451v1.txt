Given a map from a rectangle in the n-dimensional real Euclidean space into a metric semigroup, we introduce a concept of the total variation, which generalizes a similar concept due to T. H. Hildebrandt (1963) for real functions of two variables and A. S. Leonov (1998) for real functions of n variables, and study its properties. We show that the total variation has many classical properties of Jordan's variation such as the additivity, generalized triangle inequality and sequential lower semicontinuity. We prove two variants of a pointwise selection principle of Helly-type, one of which is as follows: a pointwise precompact sequence of metric semigroup valued maps on the rectangle, whose total variations are uniformly bounded, admits a pointwise convergent subsequence.
