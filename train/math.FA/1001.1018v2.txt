We prove that if T is an operator on an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space whose spectrum and essential spectrum are both connected and whose Fredholm index is only 0 or 1, then the only nontrivial norm-stable invariant subspaces of T are the finite-dimensional ones. We also characterize norm-stable invariant subspaces of any weighted unilateral shift operator. We show that quasianalytic shift operators are points of norm continuity of the lattice of the invariant subspaces. We also provide a necessary condition for strongly stable invariant subspaces for certain operators.
