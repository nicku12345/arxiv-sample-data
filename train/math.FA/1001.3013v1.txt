We discuss boundedness and compactness properties of the embedding M_\Lambda^1\subset L^1(\mu), where M_\Lambda^1 is the closure of the monomials x^{\lambda_n} in L1([0,1]) and \mu is a finite positive Borel measure on the interval [0,1]. In particular, we introduce a class of "sublinear" measures and provide a rather complete solution of the embedding problem for the class of quasilacunary sequences \Lambda. Finally, we show how one can recapture some of Al Alam's results on boundedness and essential norm of weighted composition operators from M_\Lambda^1 to L1([0,1]).
