We generalize, on one hand, some results known for composition operators on Hardy spaces to the case of Hardy-Orlicz spaces H^\Psi: construction of a "slow" Blaschke product giving a non-compact composition operator on H^\Psi; construction of a surjective symbol whose composition operator is compact on H^\Psi and, moreover, is in all the Schatten classes S_p (H^2), p > 0. On the other hand, we revisit the classical case of composition operators on H^2, giving first a new, and simplier, characterization of closed range composition operators, and then showing directly the equivalence of the two characterizations of membership in the Schatten classes of Luecking and Luecking and Zhu.
