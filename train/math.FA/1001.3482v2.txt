Given a Hilbert space and the generator A of a strongly continuous, exponentially stable, semigroup on this Hilbert space. For any g(-s) \in {\mathcal H}_{\infty} we show that there exists an infinite-time admissible output operator g(A). If g is rational, then this operator is bounded, and equals the "normal" definition of g(A). In particular, when g(s)=1/(s + \alpha),  \alpha \in {\mathbb C}_0^+, then this admissible output operator equals (\alpha I - A)^{-1}. Although in general g(A) may be unbounded, we always have that g(A) multiplied by the semigroup is a bounded operator for every (strictly) positive time instant. Furthermore, when there exists an admissible output operator C such that (C,A) is exactly observable, then g(A) is bounded for all g's with g(-s) \in {\mathcal H}_{\infty}, i.e., there exists a bounded {\mathcal H}_{\infty}-calculus. Moreover, we rediscover some well-known classes of generators also having a bounded {\mathcal H}_{\infty}-calculus.
