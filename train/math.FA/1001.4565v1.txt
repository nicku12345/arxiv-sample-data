We consider a family of measures \mu supported in \br^d and generated in the sense of Hutchinson by a finite family of affine transformations. It is known that interesting sub-families of these measures allow for an orthogonal basis in L^2(\mu) consisting of complex exponentials, i.e., a Fourier basis corresponding to a discrete subset \Gamma in \br^d. Here we offer two computational devices for understanding the interplay between the possibilities for such sets \Gamma (spectrum) and the measures \mu themselves. Our computations combine the following three tools: duality, discrete harmonic analysis, and dynamical systems based on representations of the Cuntz C^*-algebras \mathcal O_N.
