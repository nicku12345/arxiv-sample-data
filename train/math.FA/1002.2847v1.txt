We continue our study of the Johnson-Lindenstrauss lemma and its connection to circulant matrices started in \cite{HV}. We reduce the bound on k from k=O(\epsilon^{-2}\log^3n) proven there to k=O(\epsilon^{-2}\log^2n). Our technique differs essentially from the one used in \cite{HV}. We employ the discrete Fourier transform and singular value decomposition to deal with the dependency caused by the circulant structure.
