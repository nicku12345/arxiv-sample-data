Motivated by the Invariant Subspace Problem, we describe explicitly the closed subspace H^2 generated by the limit points in the H^2 norm of the orbit of a thin Blaschke product B under composition operators C_\phi induced by non-elliptic automorphisms. This description exhibits a surprising connection to model spaces. Finally, we give a constructive characterization of the C_\phi-eigenfunctions in H^p for 1\le p\le \infty.
