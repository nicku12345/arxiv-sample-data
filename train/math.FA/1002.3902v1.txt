It is a translation of an old paper of mine. We describe the topology tau_p in the space Pi_p(Y,X), for which the closures of convex sets in tau_p and in *-weak topology of the space Pi_p(Y,X) are coincident. Thereafter, we investigate some properties of the space Pi_p, related to this new topology. 2010-remark: Occasionally, the topology is coincides with the lambda_p-topology from the paper "Compact operators which factor through subspaces of l_p", Math. Nachr. 281(2008), 412-423 by Deba Prasad Sinha and Anil Kumar Karn.
