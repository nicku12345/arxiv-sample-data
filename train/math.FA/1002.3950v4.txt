In the spirit of the work of Grothendieck, we introduce and study natural symmetric n-fold tensor norms. We prove that there are exactly six natural symmetric tensor norms for n\ge 3, a noteworthy difference with the 2-fold case in which there are four. We also describe the polynomial ideals associated to these natural symmetric tensor norms. Using a symmetric version of a result of Carne, we establish which natural symmetric tensor norms preserve Banach algebras.
