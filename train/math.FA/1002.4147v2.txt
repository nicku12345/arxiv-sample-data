Let us consider a Banach space X with the property that every real-valued Lipschitz function f can be uniformly approximated by a Lipschitz, C^1-smooth function g with \Lip(g)\le C \Lip(f) (with C depending only on the space X). This is the case for a Banach space X bi-Lipschitz homeomorphic to a subset of c_0(\Gamma), for some set \Gamma, such that the coordinate functions of the homeomorphism are C^1-smooth. Then, we prove that for every closed subspace Y\subset X and every C^1-smooth (Lipschitz) function f:Y\to\Real, there is a C^1-smooth (Lipschitz, respectively) extension of f to X. We also study C^1-smooth extensions of real-valued functions defined on closed subsets of X.
