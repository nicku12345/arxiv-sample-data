In this paper, we develop an abstract framework for John-Nirenberg inequalities associated to BMO-type spaces. This work can be seen as the sequel of [5], where the authors introduced a very general framework for atomic and molecular Hardy spaces. Moreover, we show that our assumptions allow us to recover some already known John-Nirenberg inequalities. We give applications to the atomic Hardy spaces too.
