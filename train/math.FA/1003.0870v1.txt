It is shown that every separable reflexive Banach space is a quotient of a reflexive Hereditarily Indecomposable space, which yields that every separable reflexive Banach is isomorphic to a subspace of a reflexive Indecomposable space. Furthermore, every separable reflexive Banach space is a quotient of a reflexive complementably \ell_p saturated space with 1<p<\infty and of a c_0 saturated space.
