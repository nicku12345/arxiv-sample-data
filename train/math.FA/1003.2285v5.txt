A real semi-inner-product space is a real vector space \M equipped with a function [.,.] : \M \times \M \to \Re which is linear in its first variable, strictly positive and satisfies the Schwartz inequality. It is well-known that the function ||x|| = \sqrt{[x,x]} defines a norm on \M. and vica versa, for every norm on X there is a semi-inner-product satisfying this equality. A linear operator A on \M is called \emph{adjoint abelian with respect to [.,.]}, if it satisfies [Ax,y]=[x,Ay] for every x,y \in \M. The aim of this paper is to characterize the diagonalizable adjoint abelian operators in finite dimensional real semi-inner-product spaces satisfying a certain smoothness condition.
