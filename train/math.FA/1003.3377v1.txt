In this paper, we will study the topological centers of n-th dual of Banach A-module and we extend some propositions from Lau and \ddot{U}lger into n-th dual of Banach A-modules. Let B be a Banach A-bimodule. By using some new conditions, we show that {{Z}^\ell}_{A^{(n)}}(B^{(n)})=B^{(n)} and {{Z}^\ell}_{B^{(n)}}(A^{(n)})=A^{(n)}. We also have some conclusions in dual groups.
