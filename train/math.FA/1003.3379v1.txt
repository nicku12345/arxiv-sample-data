Assume that A, B are Banach algebras and m:A\times B\to B, m^\prime:A\times A\to B are bounded bilinear mappings. We will study the relation between Arens regularities of m, m^\prime and the Banach algebras A, B. For Banach A-bimodule B, we show that B factors with respect to A if and only if B^{**} is an unital A^{**}-module, and we define locally topological center for elements of A^{**} and will show that when locally topological center of mixed unit of A^{**} is B^{**}, then B^* factors on both sides with respect to A if and only if B^{**} has a unit as A^{**}-module.
