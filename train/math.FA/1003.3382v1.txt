In this article, for Banach left and right module actions, we will extend some propositions from Lau and \ddot{U}lger into general situations and we establish the relationships between topological centers of module actions. We also introduce the new concepts as Lw^*w-property and Rw^*w-property for Banach A-bimodule B and we investigate the relations between them and topological center of module actions. We have some applications in dual groups.
