A linear continuous nonzero operator G:X->Y is a Daugavet center if every rank-1 operator T:X->Y satisfies ||G+T||=||G||+||T||. We study the case when either X or Y is a sum X_1 \oplus_F X_2 of two Banach spaces X_1 and X_2 by some two-dimensional Banach space F. We completely describe the class of those F such that for some spaces X_1 and X_2 there exists a Daugavet center acting from X_1\oplus_F X_2, and the class of those F such that for some pair of spaces X_1 and X_2 there is a Daugavet center acting into X_1\oplus_F X_2. We also present several examples of such Daugavet centers.
