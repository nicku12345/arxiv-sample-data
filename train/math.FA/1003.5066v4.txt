Given n\geq1 and r\in[0, 1), we consider the set \mathcal{R}_{n, r} of rational functions having at most n poles all outside of \frac{1}{r}\mathbb{D}, were \mathbb{D} is the unit disc of the complex plane. We give an asymptotically sharp Bernstein-type inequality for functions in \mathcal{R}_{n, r}\: (as n tends to infinity and r tends to 1-) in weighted Bergman spaces with "polynomially" decreasing weights. We also prove that this result can not be extended to weighted Bergman spaces with "super-polynomially" decreasing weights.
