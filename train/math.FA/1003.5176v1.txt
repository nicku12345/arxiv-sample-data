The main results of the paper: {\bf (1)} The dual Banach space X^* contains a linear subspace A\subset X^* such that the set A^{(1)} of all limits of weak^* convergent bounded nets in A is a proper norm-dense subset of X^* if and only if X is a non-quasi-reflexive Banach space containing an infinite-dimensional subspace with separable dual. {\bf (2)} Let X be a non-reflexive Banach space. Then there exists a convex subset A\subset X^* such that A^{(1)}\neq {\bar{A}\,}^* (the latter denotes the weak^* closure of A). {\bf (3)} Let X be a quasi-reflexive Banach space and A\subset X^* be an absolutely convex subset. Then A^{(1)}={\bar{A}\,}^*.
