For \alpha an ordinal, we investigate the class \mathscr{SZ}_\alpha consisting of all operators whose Szlenk index is an ordinal not exceeding \omega^\alpha. Our main result is that \mathscr{SZ}_\alpha is a closed, injective, surjective operator ideal for each \alpha. We also study the relationship between the classes \mathscr{SZ}_\alpha and several well-known closed operator ideals.
