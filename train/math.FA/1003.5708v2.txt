For \alpha an ordinal and 1<p<\infty, we determine a necessary and sufficient condition for an \ell_p-direct sum of operators to have Szlenk index not exceeding \omega^\alpha. It follows from our results that the Szlenk index of an \ell_p-direct sum of operators is determined in a natural way by the behaviour of the \epsilon-Szlenk indices of its summands. Our methods give similar results for c_0-direct sums.
