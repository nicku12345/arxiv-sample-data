For \alpha an ordinal, we investigate the class \mathscr{SZ}_\alpha consisting of all operators whose Szlenk index is an ordinal not exceeding \omega^\alpha. We show that each class \mathscr{SZ}_\alpha is a closed operator ideal and study various operator ideal properties for these classes. The relationship between the classes \mathscr{SZ}_\alpha and several well-known closed operator ideals is investigated and quantitative factorization results in terms of the Szlenk index are obtained for the class of Asplund operators.
