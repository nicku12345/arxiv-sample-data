It is known that there are complete, Hausdorff and regular convergence vector spaces X and Y such that Lc(X,Y), the space of continuous linear mappings from X into Y equipped with the continuous convergence structure, is not complete. In this paper, we give sufficient conditions on a convergence vector space Y such that Cc(X,Y) is complete for any convergence space X. In particular, we show that this is true for every complete and Hausdorff topological vector space Y.
