Let T:X\to X be a linear power bounded operator on Banach space. Let X_0 is a subspace of vectors tending to zero under iterating of T. We prove that if X_0 is not equal to X then there exists \lambda in Sp(T) such that, for every \epsilon>0, there is x such that |Tx-\lambda x|<\epsilon  but |T^nx|>1-\epsilon for all n. The technique we develop enables us to establish that if X is reflexive and there exists a compactum K in X such that for every norm-one x\in X \rho\{T^nx, K\}<\alpha (T)<1 for some n=n_1, n_2,... then codim(X_0)<\infty. The results hold also for a one-parameter semigroup.
