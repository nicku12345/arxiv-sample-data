The main goal of this paper is to characterize arbitrary nonlinear (non-multilinear) mappings f:X_{1}\times...\times X_{n}\rightarrow Y between Banach spaces that satisfy a quite natural Pietsch Domination-type theorem around a given point (a_{1},...,a_{n})\in X_{1}\times...\times X_{n}. As a consequence of our approach a notion of weighted summability arises naturally, which may be an interesting topic for further investigation.
