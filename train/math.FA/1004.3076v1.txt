An explicit construction of all the homogeneous holomorphic Hermitian vector bundles over the unit disc \mathbb D is given. It is shown that every such vector bundle is a direct sum of irreducible ones. Among these irreducible homogeneous holomorphic Hermitian vector bundles over \mathbb D, the ones corresponding to operators in the Cowen-Douglas class {\mathrm B}_n(\mathbb D) are identified. The classification of homogeneous operators in {\mathrm B}_n(\mathbb D) is completed using an explicit realization of these operators. We also show how the homogeneous operators in {\mathrm B}_n(\mathbb D) split into similarity classes.
