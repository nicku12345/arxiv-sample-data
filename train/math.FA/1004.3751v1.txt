For any n-by-n complex matrix T and any 1\leqslant k\leqslant n, let \Lambda_{k}(T) the set of all \lambda\in \C such that PTP=\lambda P for some rank-k orthogonal projection P be its higher rank-k numerical range. It is shown that if \bbS is the n-dimensional shift on {\C}^{n} then its rank-k numerical range is the circular disc centred in zero and with radius \cos\dfrac{k\pi}{n+1} if 1<k\leqslant\left[\frac{n+1}{2} \right] and the empty set if \left[\frac{n+1}{2} \right]<k\leqslant n, where \left[x \right]  denote the integer part of x. This extends and rafines previous results of U. Haagerup, P. de la Harpe \cite{Haagerup} on the classical numerical range of the n-dimensional shift on{\C}^{n}. An interesting result for higher rank-k numerical range of nilpotent operator is also established.
