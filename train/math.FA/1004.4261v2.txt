In this paper the Hamiltonian for the system of semi-relativistic particles interacting with a scalar bose field is investigated. A scaled total Hamiltonian of the system is defined and its scaling limit is considered. Then the semi-relativistic Schrodinger operator with an effective potential is derived.
