In this paper we prove an infinite-dimensional version of Sard's theorem for Fr\'{e}chet manifolds.   Let  M  and  N  be bounded Fr\'{e}chet manifolds such that the topologies of their model Fr\'{e}chet spaces are defined by metrics with absolutely convex balls.   Let  f: M \rightarrow N  be an  MC^k-Lipschitz-Fredholm map with  k > \max \lbrace {\Ind f,0} \rbrace . Then the set of regular values of  f  is residual in  N .
