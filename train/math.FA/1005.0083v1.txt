The left multiplicative continuous compactification of a semitopological semigroup is the universal semigroup compactification. In this paper an internal construction of a semigroup compactification of a semitopological semigroup is constructed as a space of filters. In \cite{Akbari}, we described an external construction of a semigroup compactification of a semitopological semigroup.
