Let X be a Banach space. We prove that, for a large class of Banach or quasi-Banach spaces E of X-valued sequences, the sets E-\bigcup _{q\in\Gamma}\ell_{q}(X), where \Gamma is any subset of (0,\infty], and E-c_{0}(X) contain closed infinite-dimensional subspaces of E (if non-empty, of course). This result is applied in several particular cases and it is also shown that the same technique can be used to improve a result on the existence of spaces formed by norm-attaining linear operators.
