Let X be a separable Banach space with a separating polynomial. We show that there exists C\geq 1 (depending only on X) such that for every Lipschitz function f:X\rightarrow\mathbb{R}, and every \epsilon>0, there exists a Lipschitz, real analytic function g:X\rightarrow\mathbb{R} such that |f(x)-g(x)|\leq \epsilon and \textrm{Lip}(g)\leq C\textrm{Lip}(f). This result is new even in the case when X is a Hilbert space. Furthermore, in the Hilbertian case we also show that C can be assumed to be any number greater than 1.
