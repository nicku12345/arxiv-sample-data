A nonempty closed convex bounded subset C of a Banach space is said to have the weak approximate fixed point property if for every continuous map f:C\to C there is a sequence \{x_n\} in C such that x_n-f(x_n) converge weakly to 0. We prove in particular that C has this property whenever it contains no sequence equivalent to the standard basis of \ell_1. As a byproduct we obtain a characterization of Banach spaces not containing \ell_1 in terms of the weak topology.
