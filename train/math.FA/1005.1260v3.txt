We study the problem of whether \mathcal{P}_w(^nE), the space of n-homogeneous polynomials which are weakly continuous on bounded sets, is an M-ideal in the space of continuous n-homogeneous polynomials \mathcal{P}(^nE). We obtain conditions that assure this fact and present some examples. We prove that if \mathcal{P}_w(^nE) is an M-ideal in \mathcal{P}(^nE), then \mathcal{P}_w(^nE) coincides with \mathcal{P}_{w0}(^nE) (n-homogeneous polynomials that are weakly continuous on bounded sets at 0). We introduce a polynomial version of property (M) and derive that if \mathcal{P}_w(^nE)=\mathcal{P}_{w0}(^nE) and \mathcal{K}(E) is an M-ideal in \mathcal{L}(E), then \mathcal{P}_w(^nE) is an M-ideal in \mathcal{P}(^nE). We also show that if \mathcal{P}_w(^nE) is an M-ideal in \mathcal{P}(^nE), then the set of n-homogeneous polynomials whose Aron-Berner extension do not attain the norm is nowhere dense in \mathcal{P}(^nE). Finally, we face an analogous M-ideal problem for block diagonal polynomials.
