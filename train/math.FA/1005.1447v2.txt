The system of semi-relativistic particles coupled to a scalar Bose field is considered. A scaled total Hamiltonian for the system is a self-adjoint operator on a tensor product of a square-integrable function space and a boson Fock space. We consider the strong resolvent limit of a renormalized Hamiltonian, which is defined by subtracting a divergent term from the scaled total Hamiltonian. Applying an abstract scaling limit theory and a unitary transformation, we derive the Yukawa potential and Coulomb potential as effective potentials.
