We introduce the symmetric-Radon-Nikod\'ym property (sRN property) for finitely generated s-tensor norms \beta of order n and prove a Lewis type theorem for s-tensor norms with this property. As a consequence, if \beta is a projective s-tensor norm with the sRN property, then for every Asplund space E, the canonical map \widetilde{\otimes}_{\beta}^{n,s} E' \to \Big(\widetilde{\otimes}_{\beta'}^{n,s} E \Big)' is a metric surjection. This can be rephrased as the isometric isomorphism \mathcal{Q}^{min}(E) = \mathcal{Q}(E) for certain polynomial ideal \Q. We also relate the sRN property of an s-tensor norm with the Asplund or Radon-Nikod\'{y}m properties of different tensor products. Similar results for full tensor products are also given. As an application, results concerning the ideal of n-homogeneous extendible polynomials are obtained, as well as a new proof of the well known isometric isomorphism between nuclear and integral polynomials on Asplund spaces.
