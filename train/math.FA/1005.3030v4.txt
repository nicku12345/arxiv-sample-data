In this paper we prove a discrete version of Tanaka's Theorem \cite{Ta} for the Hardy-Littlewood maximal operator in dimension n=1, both in the non-centered and centered cases. For the discrete non-centered maximal operator \widetilde{M}  we prove that, given a function f: \mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{R} of bounded variation, \textrm{Var}(\widetilde{M} f) \leq \textrm{Var}(f), where \textrm{Var}(f) represents the total variation of f. For the discrete centered maximal operator M we prove that, given a function f: \mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{R} such that f \in \ell^1(\mathbb{Z}), \textrm{Var}(Mf) \leq C \|f\|_{\ell^1(\mathbb{Z})}. This provides a positive solution to a question of Haj{\l}asz and Onninen \cite{HO} in the discrete one-dimensional case.
