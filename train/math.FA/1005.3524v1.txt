Using the method of forcing we prove that consistently there is a Banach space of continuous functions on a compact Hausdorff space with the Grothendieck property and with density less than the continuum. It follows that the classical result stating that ``no nontrivial complemented subspace of a Grothendieck C(K) space is separable'' cannot be strengthened by replacing ``is separable'' by ``has density less than that of l_\infty'', without using an additional set-theoretic assumption. Such a strengthening was proved by Haydon, Levy and Odell, assuming Martin's axiom and the negation of the continuum hypothesis. Moreover, our example shows that certain separation properties of Boolean algebras are quite far from the Grothendieck property.
