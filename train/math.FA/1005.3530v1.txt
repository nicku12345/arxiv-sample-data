We consider the question whether there exists a Banach space X of density continuum such that every Banach space of density not bigger than continuum isomorphically embeds into X (called a universal Banach space of density \cc). It is well known that \ell_\infty/c_0 is such a space if we assume the continuum hypothesis. However, some additional set-theoretic assumption is needed, as we prove in the main result of this paper that it is consistent with the usual axioms of set-theory that there is no universal Banach space of density \cc. Thus, the problem of the existence of a universal Banach space of density \cc is undecidable using the usual axioms of set-theory.   We also prove that it is consistent that there are universal Banach spaces of density \cc, but \ell_\infty/c_0 is not among them. This relies on the proof of the consistency of the nonexistence of an isomorphic embedding of C([0,\cc]) into \ell_\infty/c_0.
