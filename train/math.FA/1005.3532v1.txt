We show that for each natural n>1 it is consistent that there is a compact Hausdorff space K_{2n} such that in C(K_{2n}) there is no uncountable (semi)biorthogonal sequence (f_\xi,\mu_\xi)_{\xi\in \omega_1} where \mu_\xi's are atomic measures with supports consisting of at most 2n-1 points of K_{2n}, but there are biorthogonal systems (f_\xi,\mu_\xi)_{\xi\in \omega_1} where \mu_\xi's are atomic measures with supports consisting of 2n points. This complements a result of Todorcevic that it is consistent that each nonseparable Banach space C(K) has an uncountable biorthogonal system where the functionals are measures of the form \delta_{x_\xi}-\delta_{y_\xi} for \xi<\omega_1 and x_\xi,y_\xi\in K. It also follows that it is consistent that the irredundance of the Boolean algebra Clop(K) or the Banach algebra C(K) for K totally disconnected can be strictly smaller than the sizes of biorthogonal systems in C(K). The compact spaces exhibit an interesting behaviour with respect to known cardinal functions: the hereditary density of the powers K_{2n}^k is countable up to k=n and it is uncountable (even the spread is uncountable) for k>n.
