his paper deals with approximating properties of the newly defined q-generalization of the Sz\'{a}sz operators in the case q>1. Quantitative estimates of the convergence in the polynomial weighted spaces and the Voronovskaja's theorem are given. In particular, it is proved that the rate of approximation by the q-Sz\'{a}sz operators (q>1) is of order q^{-n} versus 1/n for the classical Sz\'{a}sz--Mirakjan operators.
