Inversion of Toeplitz matrices with singular symbol. Minimal eigenvalues. Three results are stated in this paper. The first one is devoted to the study of the orthogonal polynomial with respect of the weight \varphi_{\alpha} (\theta)=\vert 1- e^{i \theta} \vert ^{2\alpha} f_{1}(e^{i \theta}), with \alpha> \demi and \alpha \in \rr \setminus \nn , and f_{1} a regular function. We obtain an asymptotic expansion of the coefficients of these polynomials, and we deduce an asymptotic of the entries of \left( T_{N} (\varphi_{\alpha})\right)^{-1} where T_{N} (\varphi_{\alpha}) is a Toeplitz matrix with symbol \varphi_{\alpha}. Then we extend a result of A. B\"ottcher and H. Widom result related to the minimal eigenvalue of the Toeplitz matrix T_{N}(\varphi_{\alpha}). For N goes to the infinity it is well known that this minimal eigenvalue admit as asymptotic \frac{c_{\alpha}}{N^{2\alpha}} f_{1}(1). When \alpha\in \nn the previous authors obtain an asymptotic of c_{\alpha} for \alpha going to the infinity, and they have the bounds of c_{\alpha} for the other cases. Here we obtain the same type of results but for \alpha a positive real.
