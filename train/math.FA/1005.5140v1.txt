In this work, we are interested to develop new directions of the famous T(1)-theorem. More precisely, we develop a general framework where we look for replacing the John-Nirenberg space BMO (in the classical result) by a new BMO_{L}, associated to a semigroup of operators (e^{-tL})_{t>0}. These new spaces BMO_L (including BMO) have recently appeared in numerous works in order to extend the theory of Hardy and BMO space to more general situations. Then we give applications by describing boundedness for a new kind of paraproducts, built on the considered semigroup. In addition we obtain a version of the classical T(1) theorem for doubling Riemannian manifolds.
