We introduce two measures of weak non-compactness Ja_E and Ja that quantify, via distances, the idea of boundary behind James' compactness theorem. These measures tell us, for a bounded subset C of a Banach space E and for given x^*\in E^*, how far from E or C one needs to go to find x^{**}\in \bar{C}^{w^*}\subset E^{**} with x^{**}(x^*)=\sup x^* (C). A quantitative version of James' compactness theorem is proved using Ja_E and Ja, and in particular it yields the following result: {\it Let C be a closed convex bounded subset of a Banach space E and r>0. If there is an element x_0^{**} in \bar{C}^{w^*} whose distance to C is greater than r, then there is x^*\in E^* such that each x^{**}\in\bar{C}^{w^*} at which \sup x^*(C) is attained has distance to E greater than r/2.} We indeed establish that Ja_E and Ja are equivalent to other measures of weak non-compactness studied in the literature. We also collect particular cases and examples showing when the inequalities between the different measures of weak non-compactness can be equalities and when the inequalities are sharp.
