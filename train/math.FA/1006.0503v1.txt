Recently Flaminio and Montagna, \cite{FlMo}, extended the language of MV-algebras by adding a unary operation, called a state-operator. This notion is introduced here also for effect algebras. Having it, we generalize the Loomis--Sikorski Theorem for monotone \sigma-complete effect algebras with internal state. In addition, we show that the category of divisible state-morphism effect algebras satisfying (RDP) and countable interpolation with an order determining system of states is dual to the category of Bauer simplices \Omega such that \partial_e \Omega is an F-space.
