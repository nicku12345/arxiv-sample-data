In this paper we present two different results in the context of nonlinear analysis. The first one is essentially a nonlinear technique that, in view of its strong generality, may be useful in different practical problems. The second result, more technical, but also connected to the first one, is an extension of the well-known Pietsch Domination Theorem. The last decade witnessed the birth of different families of Pietsch Domination-type results and some attempts of unification. Our result, that we call "full general Pietsch Domination Theorem" is potentially a definitive Pietsch Domination Theorem which unifies the previous versions and delimits what can be proved in this line.The connections to the recent notion of weighted summability are traced.
