We study frequent hypercyclicity in the context of strongly continuous semigroups of operators. More precisely, we give a criterion (sufficient condition) for a semigroup to be frequently hypercyclic, whose formulation depends on the Pettis integral. This criterion can be verified in certain cases in terms of the infinitesimal generator of semigroup. Applications are given for semigroups generated by Ornstein-Uhlenbeck operators, and especially for translation semigroups on weighted spaces of p-integrable functions, or continuous functions that, multiplied by the weight, vanish at infinity.
