We describe \sigma-additive states on effect-tribes by integrals. Effect-tribes are monotone \sigma-complete effect algebras of functions where operations are defined by points. Then we show that every state on an effect algebra is an integral through a Borel regular probability measure. Finally, we show that every \sigma-convex combination of extremal states on a monotone \sigma-complete effect algebra is a Jauch-Piron state.
