Recently in \cite{FM, FlMo}, the language of MV-algebras was extended by adding a unary operation, an internal operator, called also a state-operator. In \cite{DD1}, a stronger version of state MV-algebras, called state-morphism MV-algebras was given. In this paper, we present Stone Duality Theorems for (i) the category of Boolean algebras with a fixed state-operator and the category of compact Hausdorff topological spaces with a fixed idempotent continuous function, and for (ii) the category of weakly divisible \sigma-complete state-morphism MV-algebras and the category of Bauer simplices whose set of extreme points is basically disconnected and with a fixed idempotent continuous function.
