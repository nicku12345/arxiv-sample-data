We revisit the notion of reduced spectra sp_{\Cal {F}} (\phi) for bounded measurable functions \phi \in L^{\infty} (J,\Bbb{X}), {\Cal {F}}\subset L^1_{loc}(J,\Bbb{X}). We show that it can not be obtained via Carleman spectra unless \phi\in BUC(J,\Bbb{X}) and {\Cal {F}} \subset BUC(J,\Bbb{X}). In section 3, we give two examples which seem to be of independent interest for spectral theory. In section 4, we prove a spectral criteria for bounded mild solutions of evolution equation (*) \frac{d u(t)}{dt}= A u(t) + \phi (t) , u(0)=x\in \Bbb{X}, t\in {J}, where   A is a closed linear operator on \Bbb{X} and \phi\in L^{\infty} ({J}, \Bbb{X}) where  {J} \in\{\r_+,\r\}.
