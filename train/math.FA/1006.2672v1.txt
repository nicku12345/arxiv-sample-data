Let X and Y be separable Banach spaces and denote by \sss\sss(X,Y) the subset of \llll(X,Y) consisting of all strictly singular operators. We study various ordinal ranks on the set \sss\sss(X,Y). Our main results are summarized as follows. Firstly, we define a new rank \rs on \sss\sss(X,Y). We show that \rs is a co-analytic rank and that dominates the rank \varrho introduced by Androulakis, Dodos, Sirotkin and Troitsky [Israel J. Math., 169 (2009), 221-250]. Secondly, for every 1\leq p<+\infty we construct a Banach space Y_p with an unconditional basis such that \sss\sss(\ell_p, Y_p) is a co-analytic non-Borel subset of \llll(\ell_p,Y_p) yet every strictly singular operator T:\ell_p\to Y_p satisfies \varrho(T)\leq 2. This answers a question of Argyros.
