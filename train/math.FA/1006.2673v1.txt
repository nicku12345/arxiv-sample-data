We prove that if X is a Polish space and F is a face of P(X) with the Baire property, then F is either a meager or a co-meager subset of P(X). As a consequence we show that for every abelian Polish group X and every analytic Haar-null set A\subseteq X, the set of test measures T(A) of A is either meager or co-meager. We characterize the non-locally-compact groups as the ones for which there exists a closed Haar-null set F\subseteq X with T(F) is meager. Moreover, we answer negatively a question of J. Mycielski by showing that for every non-locally-compact abelian Polish group and every \sigma-compact subgroup G of X there exists a G-invariant F_\sigma subset of X which is neither prevalent nor Haar-null.
