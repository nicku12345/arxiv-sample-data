We solve the following three questions concerning surjective linear isometries between spaces of Lipschitz functions \mathrm{Lip}(X,E) and \mathrm{Lip}(Y,F), for strictly convex normed spaces E and F and metric spaces X and Y: \begin{enumerate} \item Characterize those base spaces X and Y for which all isometries are weighted composition maps. \item Give a condition independent of base spaces under which all isometries are weighted composition maps. \item Provide the general form of an isometry, both when it is a weighted composition map and when it is not. \end{enumerate} In particular, we prove that requirements of completeness on X and Y are not necessary when E and F are not complete, which is in sharp contrast with results known in the scalar context.
