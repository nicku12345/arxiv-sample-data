We study the so-called signed discrete Choquet integral (also called non-monotonic discrete Choquet integral) regarded as the Lov\'asz extension of a pseudo-Boolean function which vanishes at the origin. We present axiomatizations of this generalized Choquet integral, given in terms of certain functional equations, as well as by necessary and sufficient conditions which reveal desirable properties in aggregation theory.
