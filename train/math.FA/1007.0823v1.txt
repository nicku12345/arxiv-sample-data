In this article we consider linear operators satisfying a generalized commutation relation of a type of the Heisenberg-Lie algebra. It is proven that a generalized inequality of the Hardy's uncertainty principle lemma follows. Its applications to time operators and abstract Dirac operators are also investigated.
