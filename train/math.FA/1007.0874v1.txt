We prove a formula expressing the gradient of the phase function of a function f: \mathbb R^d \mapsto \mathbb C as a normalized first frequency moment of the Wigner distribution for fixed time. The formula holds when f is the Fourier transform of a distribution of compact support, or when f belongs to a Sobolev space H^{d/2+1+\epsilon}(\mathbb R^d) where \epsilon>0. The restriction of the Wigner distribution to fixed time is well defined provided a certain condition on its wave front set is satisfied. Therefore we first study the wave front set of the Wigner distribution of a tempered distribution.
