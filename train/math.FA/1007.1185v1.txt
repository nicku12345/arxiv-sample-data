It is shown that that the fractional integral operators with the parameter \alpha, 0<\alpha<1, are not bounded between the generalized grand Lebesgue spaces L^{p), \theta_1} and L^{q), \theta_2} for \theta_2 < (1+\alpha q)\theta_1, where 1<p<1/\alpha and q=\frac{p}{1-\alpha p}. Besides this, it is proved that the one--weight inequality  \|I_{\alpha}(fw^{\alpha})\|_{L_{w}^{q),\theta(1+\alpha q)}}\leq c\|f\|_{L_{w}^{p),\theta}},  where I_{\alpha} is the Riesz potential operator on the interval [0,1], holds if and only if w\in A_{1+q/p'}.
