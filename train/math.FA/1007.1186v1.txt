We introduce grand Morrey spaces and establish the boundedness of Hardy--Littlewood maximal, Calder\'on--Zygmund and potential operators in these spaces. In our case the operators and grand Morrey spaces are defined on quasi-metric measure spaces with doubling measure. The results are new even for Euclidean spaces.
