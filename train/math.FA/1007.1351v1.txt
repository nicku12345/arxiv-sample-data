In the paper two-weighted norm estimates with general weights for Hardy-type transforms, maximal functions, potentials and Calder\'on-Zygmund singular integrals in variable exponent Lebesgue spaces defined on quasimetric measure spaces (X, d, \mu) are established. In particular, we derive integral-type easily verifiable sufficient conditions governing two-weight inequalities for these operators. If exponents of Lebesgue spaces are constants, then most of the derived conditions are simultaneously necessary and sufficient for appropriate inequalities. Examples of weights governing the boundedness of maximal, potential and singular operators in weighted variable exponent Lebesgue spaces are given.
