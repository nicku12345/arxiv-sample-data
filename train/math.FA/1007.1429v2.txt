We say that a tempered distribution A belongs to the class S^m(\Ge) on a homogeneous Lie algebra \Ge if its Abelian Fourier transform a=\hat{A} is a smooth function on the dual \Ges and satisfies the estimates  |D^{\alpha}a(\xi)|\le C_{\alpha}(1+|\xi|)^{m-|\alpha|}.  Let A\in S^0(\Ge). Then the operator f\mapsto f\star\widetilde{A}(x) is bounded on L^2(\Ge). Suppose that the operator is invertible and denote by B the convolution kernel of its inverse. We show that B belongs to the class S^0(\Ge) as well. As a corollary we generalize Melin's theorem on the parametrix construction for Rockland operators.
