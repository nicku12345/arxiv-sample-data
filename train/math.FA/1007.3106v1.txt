Let B be a Banach A-bimodule and let n\geq 0. We investigate the relationships between some cohomological groups of A, that is, if the topological center of the left module action \pi_\ell:A\times B\rightarrow B of A^{(2n)} on B^{(2n)} is B^{(2n)} and H^1(A^{(2n+2)},B^{(2n+2)})=0, then we have H^1(A,B^{(2n)})=0, and we find the relationships between cohomological groups such as H^1(A,B^{(n+2)}) and H^1(A,B^{(n)}), spacial H^1(A,B^*) and H^1(A,B^{(2n+1)}). We obtain some results in Connes-amenability of Banach algebras, and so for every compact group G, we conclude that H^1_{w^*}(L^\infty(G)^*,L^\infty(G)^{**})=0. Let G be an amenable locally compact group. Then there is a Banach L^1(G)-bimodule such as (L^\infty(G),.) such that Z^1(L^1(G),L^\infty(G))=\{L_{f}:~f\in L^\infty(G)\}. We also obtain some conclusions in the Arens regularity of module actions and weak amenability of Banach algebras. We introduce some new concepts as left-weak^*-to-weak convergence property [=Lw^*wc-property] and right-weak^*-to-weak convergence property [=Rw^*wc-property] with respect to A and we show that if A^* and A^{**}, respectively, have Rw^*wc-property and Lw^*wc-property and A^{**} is weakly amenable, then A is weakly amenable. We also show to relations between a derivation D:A\rightarrow A^* and this new concepts.
