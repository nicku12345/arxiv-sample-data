The distribution g_{cl} of a Gibbs cluster point process in X=\mathbb{R}^{d} (with i.i.d. random clusters attached to points of a Gibbs configuration with distribution g) is studied via the projection of an auxiliary Gibbs measure \hat{g} in the space of configurations \hat{gamma}=\{(x,\bar{y})\}\subset X\times\mathfrak{X}, where x\in X indicates a cluster "center" and \bar{y}\in\mathfrak{X}:=\bigsqcup_{n} X^n represents a corresponding cluster relative to x. We show that the measure g_{cl} is quasi-invariant with respect to the group \mathrm{Diff}_{0}(X) of compactly supported diffeomorphisms of X, and prove an integration-by-parts formula for g_{cl}. The associated equilibrium stochastic dynamics is then constructed using the method of Dirichlet forms. These results are quite general; in particular, the uniqueness of the background Gibbs measure g is not required. The paper is an extension of the earlier results for Poisson cluster measures %obtained by the authors [J. Funct. Analysis 256 (2009) 432-478], where a different projection construction was utilized specific to this "exactly soluble" case.
