We give characterizations for homogeneous and inhomogeneous Besov-Lizorkin-Triebel spaces in terms of continuous local means for the full range of parameters. In particular, we prove characterizations in terms of Lusin functions and spaces involving the Peetre maximal function to apply the classical coorbit space theory due to Feichtinger and Gr\"ochenig. This results in atomic decompositions and wavelet bases for homogeneous spaces. In particular we give sufficient conditions for suitable wavelets in terms of moment, decay and smoothness conditions.
