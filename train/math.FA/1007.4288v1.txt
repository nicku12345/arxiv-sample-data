In this work, we define new sequence spaces by combining generalized weighted mean and difference operator. Afterward, we investigate topological structure which are completeness, AK-property, AD-property. Also, we compute the alpha, beta and gamma duals, and obtain bases for these sequence spaces. Finally, necessary and sufficient conditions on an infinite matrix belonging to the classes (c(u,v,):\ell_{\infty}) and (c(u,v,):c) are established.
