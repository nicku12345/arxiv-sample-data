Compressed sensing is a new scheme which shows the ability to recover sparse signal from fewer measurements, using l_1 minimization. Recently, Chartrand and Staneva shown in \cite{CS1} that the l_p minimization with 0<p<1 recovers sparse signals from fewer linear measurements than does the l_1 minimization. They proved that l_p minimization with 0<p<1 recovers S-sparse signals x\in\RN from fewer Gaussian random measurements for some smaller p with probability exceeding 1 - 1 / {N\choose S}. The first aim of this paper is to show that above result is right for the case of random,Gaussian measurements with probability exceeding 1-2e^{-c(p)M}, where M is the numbers of rows of random, Gaussian measurements and c(p) is a positive constant that guarantees 1-2e^{-c(p)M}>1 - 1 / {N\choose S} for p smaller. The second purpose of the paper is to show that under certain weaker conditions, decoders \triangle_p are stable in the sense that they are (2,p) instance optimal for a large class of encoder for 0<p<1.
