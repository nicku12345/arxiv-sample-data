One of the couple of translatable radii of an operator in the direction of another operator introduced in earlier work[13] is studied in details. A necessary and sufficient condition for a unit vector f to be a stationary vector of the generalized eigenvalue problem  Tf = \lambda A f  is obtained. Finally a theorem of Williams[16] is generalized to obtain a translatable radius of an operator in the direction of another operator.
