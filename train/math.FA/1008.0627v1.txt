We present sampling theorems for reproducing kernel Banach spaces on Lie groups. Recent approaches to this problem rely on integrability of the kernel and its local oscillations. In this paper we replace the integrability conditions by requirements on the derivatives of the reproducing kernel. The results are then used to obtain frames and atomic decompositions for Banach spaces of distributions stemming from a cyclic representation, and it is shown that this is particularly easy, when the cyclic vector is a G{\aa}rding vector for a square integrable representation.
