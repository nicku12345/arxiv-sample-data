We study the Segal-Bargmann transform on the Heisenberg motion groups \mathbb{H}^n \ltimes K, where \mathbb{H}^n is the Heisenberg group and K is a compact subgroup of U(n) such that (K,\mathbb{H}^n) is a Gelfand pair. The Poisson integrals associated to the Laplacian for the Heisenberg motion group are also characterized using Gutzmer's formulae. Explicitly realizing certain unitary irreducible representations of \mathbb{H}^n \ltimes K, we prove the Plancherel theorem. A Paley-Wiener type theorem is proved using complexified representations.
