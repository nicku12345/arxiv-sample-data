In this paper, we study the Arens regularity properties of module actions and we extend some proposition from Baker, Dales, Lau and others into general situations. For Banach A-bimodule B, let Z_1(A^{**}), {Z}^\ell_{B^{**}}(A^{**}) and {Z}^\ell_{A^{**}}(B^{**}) be the topological centers of second dual of Banach algebra A, left module action \pi_\ell:~A\times B\rightarrow B and right module action \pi_r:~B\times A\rightarrow B, respectively. We establish some relationships between them and factorization properties of A^* and B^*. We search some necessary and sufficient conditions for factorization of A^*, B and B^* with some results in group algebras. We extend the definitions of the left and right multiplier for module actions.
