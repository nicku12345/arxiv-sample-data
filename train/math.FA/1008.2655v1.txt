In this paper, first we study some Arens regularity properties of module actions. Let B be a Banach A-bimodule and let {Z}^\ell_{B^{**}}(A^{**}) and {Z}^\ell_{A^{**}}(B^{**}) be the topological centers of the left module action \pi_\ell:~A\times B\rightarrow B and the right module action \pi_r:~B\times A\rightarrow B, respectively. We investigate some relationships between topological center of A^{**}, {Z}_1({A^{**}}) with respect to the first Arens product and topological centers of module actions {Z}^\ell_{B^{**}}(A^{**}) and {Z}^\ell_{A^{**}}(B^{**}). On the other hand, if A has Mazure property and B^{**} has the left A^{**}-factorization, then Z^\ell_{A^{**}}(B^{**})=B, and so for a locally compact non-compact group G with compact covering number card(G), we have Z^\ell_{M(G)^{**}}{(L^1(G)^{**})}= {L^1(G)} and Z^\ell_{L^1(G)^{**}}{(M(G)^{**})}= {M(G)}. By using the Arens regularity of module actions, we study some cohomological groups properties of Banach algebra and we extend some propositions from Dales, Ghahramani, Gr{\o}nb{\ae}k and others into general situations and we investigate the relationships between some cohomological groups of Banach algebra A. We obtain some results in Connes-amenability of Banach algebras, and so for every compact group G, we conclude that H^1_{w^*}(L^\infty(G)^*,L^\infty(G)^{**})=0. Suppose that G is an amenable locally compact group. Then there is a Banach L^1(G)-bimodule such as (L^\infty(G),.) such that Z^1(L^1(G),L^\infty(G))=\{L_{f}:~f\in L^\infty(G)\} where for every g\in L^1(G), we have L_f(g)=f.g.
