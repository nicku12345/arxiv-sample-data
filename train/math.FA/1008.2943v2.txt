According to a celebrated result by L\"owner, a real-valued function f is operator monotone if and only if its L\"owner matrix, which is the matrix of divided differences L_f=(\frac{f(x_i)-f(x_j)}{x_i-x_j})_{i,j=1}^N, is positive semidefinite for every integer N>0 and any choice of x_1,x_2,...,x_N. In this paper we answer a question of R. Bhatia, who asked for a characterisation of real-valued functions g defined on (0,+\infty) for which the matrix of divided sums K_g=(\frac{g(x_i)+g(x_j)}{x_i+x_j})_{i,j=1}^N, which we call its anti-L\"owner matrix, is positive semidefinite for every integer N>0 and any choice of x_1,x_2,...,x_N\in(0,+\infty). Such functions, which we call anti-L\"owner functions, have applications in the theory of Lyapunov-type equations.
