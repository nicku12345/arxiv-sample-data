Bonet, Frerick, Peris and Wengenroth constructed a hypercyclic operator on the locally convex direct sum of countably many copies of the Banach space \ell_1. We extend this result. In particular, we show that there is a hypercyclic operator on the locally convex direct sum of a sequence \{X_n\}_{n\in\N} of Fr\'echet spaces if and only if each X_n is separable and there are infinitely many n\in\N for which X_n is infinite dimensional. Moreover, we characterize inductive limits of sequences of separable Banach spaces which support a hypercyclic operator.
