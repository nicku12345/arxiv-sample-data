Jorgensen and Pedersen have proven that a certain fractal measure \nu has no infinite set of complex exponentials which form an orthonormal set in L^2(\nu). We prove that any fractal measure \mu obtained from an affine iterated function system possesses a sequence of complex exponentials which forms a Riesz basic sequence, or more generally a Bessel sequence, in L^2(\mu) such that the frequencies have positive Beurling dimension.
