We introduce a general definition of homogeneous Besov spaces on a stratified Lie group G, based on a Littlewood-Paley-type decomposition of Schwartz functions with all moments vanishing. We show that under mild and intuitive conditions the spaces thus defined are independent of the decomposition employed. A corollary of this is that previously constructed versions of homogeneous Besov spaces on G, relying on the spectral calculus of a sub-Laplacian of the group, are consistent, i.e., independent of the choice of sub-Laplacian.   We further prove characterizations of homogeneous Besov spaces using continuous wavelet transforms, with a large variety of analysing wavelets to choose from.
