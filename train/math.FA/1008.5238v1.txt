There has been a long-standing conjecture in Banach algebra that every amenable operator is similar to a normal operator. In this paper, we study the structure of amenable operators on Hilbert spaces. At first, we show that the conjecture is equivalent to every non-scalar amenable operator has a non-trivial hyperinvariant subspace and equivalent to every amenable operator is similar to a reducible operator and has a non-trivial invariant subspace; and then, we give two decompositions for amenable operators, which supporting the conjecture.
