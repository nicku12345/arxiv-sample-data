A complete characterization of Hilbert space operators that generate weakly amenable algebras remains open, even in the case of compact operator. Farenick, Forrest and Marcoux proposed the question that if T is a compact weakly amenable operator on a Hilbert space \mathfrak{H}, then is T similar to a normal operator?   In this paper we demonstrate an example of compact triangular operator on infinite-dimension Hilbert space which is a weakly amenable and character amenable operator but is not similar to a normal operator.
