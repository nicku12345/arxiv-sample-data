In this paper the concepts of character contractibility, approximate character amenability (contractibility) and uniform approximate character amenability (contractibility) are introduced. We are concerned with the relations among the generalized concepts of character amenability for Banach algebra. We prove that approximate character amenability and approximate character contractibility are the same properties, as are uniform approximate character amenability and character amenability, as are uniform approximate character contractibility and character contractibility. For commutative Banach algebra, we prove that character contractibility and contractibility are the same properties. Moreover, general theory for those concepts is developed.
