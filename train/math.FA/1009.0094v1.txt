We introduce the class of Beurling-Fourier algebras on locally compact groups and show that they are non-commutative analogs of classical Beurling algebras. We obtain various results with regard to the operator amenability, operator weak amenability and Arens regularity of Beurling-Fourier algebras on compact groups and show that they behave very similarly to the classical Beurling algebras of discrete groups. We then apply our results to study explicitly the Beurling-Fourier algebras on SU(2), the 2 \times 2 unitary group. We demonstrate that how Beurling-Fourier algebras are closely connected to the amenability of the Fourier algebra of SU(2). Another major consequence of our results is that our investigation allows us to construct families of unital infinite-dimensional closed Arens regular subalgebras of the Fourier algebra of certain products of SU(2).
