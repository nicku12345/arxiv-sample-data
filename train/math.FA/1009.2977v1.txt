Given an operator ideal I, a Banach space E has the I-approximation property if operators on E can be uniformly approximated on compact subsets of E by operators belonging to I. In this paper the I- approximation property is studied in projective tensor products, spaces of linear functionals, spaces of homogeneous polynomials (in particular, spaces of linear operators), spaces of holomorphic functions and their preduals.
