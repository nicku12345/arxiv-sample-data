The Pseudo-Differential Operator (p.d.o.) h_{\mu,a} associated with the Bessel Operator involving the symbol a(x,y) whose derivatives satisfy certain growth conditions depending on some increasing sequences is studied on certain Gevrey spaces. The p.d.o. h_{\mu,a} on Hankel translation \tau and Hankel convolution of Gevrey functions is continuous linear map into another Gevrey spaces.
