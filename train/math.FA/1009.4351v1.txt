Given a real, expansive dilation matrix we prove that any bandlimited function \psi \in L^2(\mathbb{R}^n), for which the dilations of its Fourier transform form a partition of unity, generates a wavelet frame for certain translation lattices. Moreover, there exists a dual wavelet frame generated by a finite linear combination of dilations of \psi with explicitly given coefficients. The result allows a simple construction procedure for pairs of dual wavelet frames whose generators have compact support in the Fourier domain and desired time localization. The construction relies on a technical condition on \psi, and we exhibit a general class of function satisfying this condition.
