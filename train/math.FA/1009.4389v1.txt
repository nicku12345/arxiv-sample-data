Let \xi = \{x^j\}_{j=1}^n be a grid of n points in the d-cube {\II}^d:=[0,1]^d, and \Phi = \{\phi_j\}_{j =1}^n a family of n functions on {\II}^d. We define the linear sampling algorithm L_n(\Phi,\xi,\cdot) for an approximate recovery of a continuous function f on {\II}^d from the sampled values f(x^1), ..., f(x^n), by L_n(\Phi,\xi,f)\ := \ \sum_{j=1}^n f(x^j)\phi_j.   For the Besov class B^\alpha_{p,\theta} of mixed smoothness \alpha (defined as the unit ball of the Besov space \MB), to study optimality of L_n(\Phi,\xi,\cdot) in L_q({\II}^d) we use the quantity r_n(B^\alpha_{p,\theta})_q \ := \ \inf_{H,\xi} \ \sup_{f \in B^\alpha_{p,\theta}} \, \|f - L_n(\Phi,xi,f)\|_q, where the infimum is taken over all grids \xi = \{x^j\}_{j=1}^n and all families \Phi = \{\phi_j\}_{j=1}^n in L_q({\II}^d). We explicitly constructed linear sampling algorithms L_n(\Phi,\xi,\cdot) on the grid \xi = \ G^d(m):= \{(2^{-k_1}s_1,...,2^{-k_d}s_d) \in \II^d : \ k_1 + ... + k_d \le m\}, with \Phi a family of linear combinations of mixed B-splines which are mixed tensor products of either integer or half integer translated dilations of the centered B-spline of order r. The grid G^d(m) is of the size 2^m m^{d-1} and sparse in comparing with the generating dyadic coordinate cube grid of the size 2^{dm}. For various 0<p,q,\theta \le \infty and 1/p < \alpha < r, we proved upper bounds for the worst case error  \sup_{f \in B^\alpha_{p,\theta}} \, \|f - L_n(\Phi,\xi,f)\|_q which coincide with the asymptotic order of r_n(B^\alpha_{p,\theta})_q in some cases. A key role in constructing these linear sampling algorithms, plays a quasi-interpolant representation of functions f \in B^\alpha_{p,\theta} by mixed B-spline series.
