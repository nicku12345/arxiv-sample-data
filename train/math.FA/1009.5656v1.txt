Suppose \alpha is an orientation preserving diffeomorphism (shift) of \mR_+=(0,\infty) onto itself with the only fixed points 0 and \infty. We establish sufficient conditions for the Fredholmness of the singular integral operator \[ (aI-bW_\alpha)P_++(cI-dW_\alpha)P_- \] acting on L^p(\mR_+) with 1<p<\infty, where P_\pm=(I\pm S)/2, S is the Cauchy singular integral operator, and W_\alpha f=f\circ\alpha is the shift operator, under the assumptions that the coefficients a,b,c,d and the derivative \alpha' of the shift are bounded and continuous on \mR_+ and may admit discontinuities of slowly oscillating type at 0 and \infty.
