We define localized modulation maps and modulation spaces of symbols suited to the study of Rieffel's deformation quantization pseudodifferential calculus. They are used to generate Hilbert space representations for the quantized C^*-algebras, starting from covariant representations of the corresponding twisted C^*-dynamical system. In the case of an Abelian undeformed algebra, orthogonal relations and extra information about the representations are obtained.
