A classical inequality due to Bohnenblust and Hille states that for every positive integer m there is a constant C_{m}>0 so that (\sum\limits_{i_{1},...,i_{m}=1}^{N}|U(e_{i_{^{1}}},...,e_{i_{m}})| ^{\frac{2m}{m+1}}) ^{\frac{m+1}{2m}}\leq C_{m}| U| for every positive integer N and every m-linear mapping U:\ell_{\infty}^{N}\times...\times\ell_{\infty}^{N}\rightarrow\mathbb{C}, where C_{m}=m^{\frac{m+1}{2m}}2^{\frac{m-1}{2}}. The value of C_{m} was improved to C_{m}=2^{\frac{m-1}{2}} by S. Kaijser and more recently H. Qu\'{e}ffelec and A. Defant and P. Sevilla-Peris remarked that C_{m}=(\frac{2}{\sqrt{\pi}})^{m-1} also works. The Bohnenblust--Hille inequality also holds for real Banach spaces with the constants C_{m}=2^{\frac{m-1}{2}}. In this note we show that a recent new proof of the Bohnenblust--Hille inequality (due to Defant, Popa and Schwarting) provides, in fact, quite better estimates for C_{m} for all values of m \in \mathbb{N}. In particular, we will also show that, for real scalars, if m is even with 2\leq m\leq 24, then C_{\mathbb{R},m}=2^{1/2}C_{\mathbb{R},m/2}. We will mainly work on a paper by Defant, Popa and Schwarting, giving some remarks about their work and explaining how to, numerically, improve the previously mentioned constants.
