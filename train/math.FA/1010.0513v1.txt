We study the range of time-frequency localization operators acting on modulation spaces and prove a lifting theorem. As an application we also characterize the range of Gabor multipliers, and, in the realm of complex analysis, we characterize the range of certain Toeplitz operators on weighted Bargmann-Fock spaces. The main tools are the construction of canonical isomorphisms between modulation spaces of Hilbert-type and a refined version of the spectral invariance of pseudodifferential operators. On the technical level we prove a new class of inequalities for weighted gamma functions.
