We investigate some multiplication properties of Kato-Sobolev spaces by adapting the techniques used in the study of Beurling algebras by Coifman and Meyer. Also we develop an analytic functional calculus for Kato-Sobolev algebras based on an integral representation formula belonging A. P. Calder\'{o}n.
