It is our aim in this note to give a counter example to an argument used in the proof of the main theorem of the paper: On iterations for families of asymptotically pseudocontractive mappings, Applied Mathematics Letters, 24 (2011), 33-38 by A. Rafiq; and give an alternative condition to correct the anomaly.
