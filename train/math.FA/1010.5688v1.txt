For Banach left and right module actions, we extend some propositions from Lau and \ddot{U}lger into general situations and we establish the relationships between topological centers of module actions. We also introduce the new concepts as Lw^*w-property and Rw^*w-property for Banach A-bimodule B and we obtain some conclusions in the topological center of module actions and Arens regularity of Banach algebras. we also study some factorization properties of left module actions and we find some relations of them and topological centers of module actions. For Banach algebra A, we extend the definition of \ast-involution algebra into Banach A-bimodule B with some results in the factorizations of B^*. We have some applications in group algebras.
