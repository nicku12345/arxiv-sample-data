We show that spaces of Colombeau generalized functions with smooth parameter dependence are isomorphic to those with continuous parametrization. Based on this result we initiate a systematic study of algebraic properties of the ring \widetilde{\mathbb{K}}_{sm} of generalized numbers in this unified setting. In particular, we investigate the ring and order structure of \widetilde{\mathbb{K}}_{sm} and establish some properties of its ideals.
