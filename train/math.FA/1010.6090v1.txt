For a given \delta, 0<\delta<1, a Blaschke sequence \sigma=\{\lambda_j\} is constructed such that every function f, f\in H^\infty, having \delta<\delta_f=\inf_{\lambda\in\sigma}|f(\lambda)|\le\|f\|_\infty\le1 is invertible in the trace algebra H^\infty|\sigma (with a norm estimate of the inverse depending on \delta_f only), but there exists f with \delta=\delta_f\le\|f\|_\infty\le1, which does not. As an application, a counterexample to a stronger form of the Bourgain--Tzafriri restricted invertibility conjecture for bounded operators is exhibited, where an ``orthogonal (or unconditional) basis'' is replaced by a ``summation block orthogonal basis''.
