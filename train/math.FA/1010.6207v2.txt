It is known, from results of B. MacCluer and J. Shapiro (1986), that every composition operator which is compact on the Hardy space H^p, 1 \leq p < \infty, is also compact on the Bergman space {\mathfrak B}^p = L^p_a (\D). In this survey, after having described the above known results, we consider Hardy-Orlicz H^\Psi and Bergman-Orlicz {\mathfrak B}^\Psi spaces, characterize the compactness of their composition operators, and show that there exist Orlicz functions for which there are composition operators which are compact on H^\Psi but not on {\mathfrak B}^\Psi.
