In this note, we study the Arens regularity of projective tensor product A\hat{\otimes}B whenever A and B are Arens regular. We establish some new conditions for showing that the Banach algebras A and B are Arens regular if and only if A\hat{\otimes}B is Arens regular. We also introduce some new concepts as left-weak^*-weak convergence property [Lw^*wc-property] and right-weak^*-weak convergence property [Rw^*wc-property] and for Banach algebra A, suppose that A^* and A^{**}, respectively, have Rw^*wc-property and Lw^*wc-property. Then if A^{**} is weakly amenable, it follows that A is weakly amenable. We also offer some results concerning the relation between these properties with some special derivation D:A\rightarrow A^*. We obtain some conclusions in the Arens regularity of Banach algebras.
