Given an isotropic random vector X with log-concave density in Euclidean space \Real^n, we study the concentration properties of |X| on all scales, both above and below its expectation. We show in particular that: \[ \P(\abs{|X| -\sqrt{n}} \geq t \sqrt{n}) \leq C \exp(-c n^{1/2} \min(t^3,t)) \;\;\; \forall t \geq 0 ~, \] for some universal constants c,C>0. This improves the best known deviation results on the thin-shell and mesoscopic scales due to Fleury and Klartag, respectively, and recovers the sharp large-deviation estimate of Paouris. Another new feature of our estimate is that it improves when X is \psi_\alpha (\alpha \in (1,2]), in precise agreement with Paouris' estimates. The upper bound on the thin-shell width \sqrt{\Var(|X|)} we obtain is of the order of n^{1/3}, and improves down to n^{1/4} when X is \psi_2. Our estimates thus continuously interpolate between a new best known thin-shell estimate and the sharp large-deviation estimate of Paouris. As a consequence, a new best known bound on the Cheeger isoperimetric constant appearing in a conjecture of Kannan--Lov\'asz--Simonovits is deduced.
