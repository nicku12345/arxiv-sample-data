In recent papers a number of authors have considered Borel probability measures \mu in \br^d such that the Hilbert space L^2(\mu) has a Fourier basis (orthogonal) of complex exponentials. If \mu satisfies this property, the set of frequencies in this set are called a spectrum for \mu. Here we fix a spectrum, say \Gamma, and we study the possibilities for measures \mu having \Gamma as spectrum.
