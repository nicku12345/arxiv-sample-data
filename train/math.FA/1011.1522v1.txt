A gap in the proof of Theorem 3.5 in the paper ``A new iteration process for approximation of common fixed points for finite families of total asymtotically nonexpansive mappings". Int. J. Math. Math. Sci. vol. 2009, doi:10.1155/2009/615107" is observed. The argument used on page 11, starting from line 8 from bottom to the end of the proof of the theorem is not correct. In this corrigendum, it is our aim to close this gap.
