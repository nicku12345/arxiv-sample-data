A generalized Nevanlinna function Q(z) with one negative square has precisely one generalized zero of nonpositive type in the closed extended upper halfplane. The fractional linear transformation defined by Q_\tau(z)=(Q(z)-\tau)/(1+\tau Q(z)), \tau \in \mathbb{R} \cup \{\infty\}, is a generalized Nevanlinna function with one negative square. Its generalized zero of nonpositive type \alpha(\tau) as a function of \tau defines a path in the closed upper halfplane. Various properties of this path are studied in detail.
