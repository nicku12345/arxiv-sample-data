Given a natural number k \geq 2, we construct a hereditarily indecomposable, \mathscr{L}_{\infty} space, X_k with dual isomorphic to \ell_1. We exhibit a non-compact, strictly singular operator S on X_k, with the property that S^k = 0 and S^j (0 \leq j \leq k-1) is not a compact perturbation of any linear combination of S^l, l \neq j. Moreover, every bounded linear operator on this space has the form \sum_{i=0}^{k-1} \lambda_i S^i +K where the \lambda_i are scalars and K is compact. In particular, this construction answers a question of Argyros and Haydon ("A hereditarily indecomposable space that solves the scalar-plus-compact problem").
