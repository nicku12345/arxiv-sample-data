We show that the absolute numerical index of the space L_p(\mu) is p^{-1/p} q^{-1/q} (where 1/p+1/q=1). In other words, we prove that  \sup\{\int |x|^{p-1}|Tx|\, d\mu \, : \ x\in L_p(\mu),\,\|x\|_p=1\} \,\geq \,p^{-\frac{1}{p}} q^{-\frac{1}{q}}\,\|T\|  for every T\in \mathcal{L}(L_p(\mu)) and that this inequality is the best possible when the dimension of L_p(\mu) is greater than one. We also give lower bounds for the best constant of equivalence between the numerical radius and the operator norm in L_p(\mu) for atomless \mu when restricting to rank-one operators or narrow operators.
