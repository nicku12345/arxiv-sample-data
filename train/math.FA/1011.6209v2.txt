The note shows that the operator-valued Hardy space \sH^1 introduced via Littlewood-Paley g-function coincides with the space of H^1_R(\T, \sL^1) of all Bochner integrable operator-valued functions with integrable analytic part. The proof is based on the noncommutative maximal inequality for Poisson group.
