In this paper we obtain necessary and sufficient conditions for a linear bounded operator in a Hilbert space H to have a three-diagonal complex symmetric matrix with non-zero elements on the first sub-diagonal in an orthonormal basis in H. It is shown that a set of all such operators is a proper subset of a set of all complex symmetric operators with a simple spectrum. Similar necessary and sufficient conditions are obtained for a linear bounded operator in H to have a three-diagonal complex skew-symmetric matrix with non-zero elements on the first sub-diagonal in an orthonormal basis in H.
