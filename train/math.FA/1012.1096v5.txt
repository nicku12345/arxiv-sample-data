We introduce and analyze spaces and algebras of generalized functions which correspond to H\" older, Zygmund, and Sobolev spaces of functions. The main scope of the paper is the characterization of the regularity of distributions that are embedded into the corresponding space or algebra of generalized functions with finite type regularities.
