In this paper we prove Korovkin type theorem for iterates of general positive linear operators T:C\left[ 0,1\right] \rightarrow C\left[ 0,1\right]  and derive quantitative estimates in terms of modulus of smoothness. In particular, we show that under some natural conditions the iterates T^{m}:C\left[ 0,1\right] \rightarrow C\left[ 0,1\right]  converges strongly to a fixed point of the original operator T. The results can be applied to several well-known operators; we present here the q-MKZ operators, the q-Stancu operators, the genuine q-Bernstein--Durrmeyer operators and the Cesaro operators.
