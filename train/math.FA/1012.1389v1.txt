We show that for a Banach algebra A with a bounded approximate identity, the amenability of the projective tensor product of A with A, the amenability of the projective tensor product of A with A^{op}and the amenability of A are equivalent. Also if A is a closed ideal in a commutative Banach algebra B, then the weak amenability of the projective tensor product of A and B implies the weak amenability of A.
