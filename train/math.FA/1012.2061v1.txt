We give a comprehensive study of interpolation inequalities for periodic functions with zero mean, including the existence of and the asymptotic expansions for the extremals, best constants, various remainder terms, etc. Most attention is paid to the critical (logarithmic) Sobolev inequality in the two-dimensional case, although a number of results concerning the best constants in the algebraic case and different space dimensions are also obtained.
