It is shown that variants of the HI methods could yield objects closely connected to the classical Banach spaces. Thus we present a new c_0 saturated space, denoted as \mathfrak{X}_0, with rather tight structure. The space \mathfrak{X}_0 is not embedded into a space with an unconditional basis and its complemented subspaces have the following structure. Everyone is either of type I, namely, contains an isomorph of \mathfrak{X}_0 itself or else is isomorphic to a subspace of c_0 (type II). Furthermore for any analytic decomposition of \mathfrak{X}_0 into two subspaces one is of type I and the other is of type II. The operators of \mathfrak{X}_0 share common features with those of HI spaces.
