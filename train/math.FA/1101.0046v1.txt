The paper is devoted to a development of the theory of self-adjoint operators in Krein spaces (J-self-adjoint operators) involving some additional properties arising from the existence of C-symmetries. The main attention is paid to the recent notion of stable C-symmetry for J-self-adjoint extensions of a symmetric operator S. The general results are specialized further by studying in detail the case where S has defect numbers <2,2>.
