In this paper, we introduce a generalized quadratic functional equation f(rx + sy) = rf(x) + sf(y) - rsf(x - y) where r, s are nonzero real numbers with r + s = 1. We show that this functional equation is quadratic if r, s are rational numbers. We also investigate its stability problem on restricted domains. These results are applied to study of an asymptotic behavior of these generalized quadratic mappings.
