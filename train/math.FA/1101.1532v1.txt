It is known that there are specific examples of ergodic transformations on measure spaces for which the calculation of the outer measure of transformation invariant sets leads to a condition closely resembling Carath\'eodory's condition for sets to be measurable. It is then natural to ask what functions are capable of `generating', that is leading to, the Carath\'eodory definition in the same way. The present work answers this question by showing that the property of generating Carath\'eodory's definition holds for the general class of outer measure preserving ergodic transformations on measure spaces. We further show that the previously found specific examples of functions generating Carath\'eodory's definition fall into this family of transformations.
