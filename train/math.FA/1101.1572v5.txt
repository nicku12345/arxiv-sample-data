Let L be a non-negative self-adjoint operator on L^2(X). Assume that operator L generates the analytic semigroup \{e^{-tL}\}_{t>0} whose kernels satisfy the standard Gaussian upper bounds. This paper investigates the sharp weighted inequalities for spectral multipliers F(L) and their commutators with BMO functions. The obtained results in this paper can be considered to be improvements of those in \cite{DSY}[Weighted norm inequalities, Gaussian bounds and sharp spectral multipliers, {\it J. Funct. Anal.}, {\bf 260} (2011), 1106-1131].
