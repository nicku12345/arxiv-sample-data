As established by R T. Rockafellar, real valued convex-concave functions are generically differentiable. It this paper we shall show that for a convex-concave function defined on an open convex set C \times D, there exist dense subsets {\cal N} of C and {\cal M} of D such that the partial derivative with respect to the first variable (resp. second variable) exists on {\cal N} \times D (resp. C \times {\cal M}) and therefore the function is differentiable on {\cal N} \times {\cal M}. This is an interesting property of convex-concave functions and it does not hold for convex-convex functions. As an immediate application we recover the generic single-valuedness of monotone operators.
