This short note has a twofold purpose:   (i) to solve the question that motivates a recent paper of D. Popa on multilinear variants of Pietsch's composition theorem for absolutely summing operators. More precisely, we remark that there is a natural perfect extension of Pietsch's composition theorem to the multilinear and polynomial settings. This fact was overlooked in the aforementioned paper;   (ii) to investigate extensions of some results of the aforementioned paper for particular situations, mainly by exploring cotype properties of the spaces involved.
