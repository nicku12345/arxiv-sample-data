The problem of factorization and parametrization of compactly supported biorthogonal wavelets was reduced to that of pseudoidentity matrix pairs by Resnikoff, Tian, and Wells in their 2001 paper. Based on a conjecture on the pseudoidentity matrix pairs of rank 2 stated in the same paper, they proved a theorem which gives a complete factorization result for rank 2 compactly supported biorthogonal wavelets. In this paper, we first provide examples to show that the conjecture is not true, then we prove a factorization theorem for pseudoidentity matrix pairs of rank m\ge 2. As a consequence, our result shows that a slightly modified version of the factorization theorem in the rank 2 case given by Resnikoff, Tian, and Wells holds. We also provide a concrete constructive method for the rank 2 case which is determined by applying the Euclidean algorithm to two polynomials.
