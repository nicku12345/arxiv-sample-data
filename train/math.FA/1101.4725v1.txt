Compactly supported shearlets have been studied in both theory and applications. In this paper, we construct symmetric compactly supported shearlet systems based on pseudo splines of type II. Specially, using B-splines, we construct shearlet frame having explicit analytical forms which is important for applications. The shearlet systems based on B-splines also provide optimally sparse approximation within cartoon-liked image.
