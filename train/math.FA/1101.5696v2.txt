The Banach space \ell_1(\Z) admits many non-isomorphic preduals, for example, C(K) for any compact countable space K, along with many more exotic Banach spaces. In this paper, we impose an extra condition: the predual must make the bilateral shift on \ell_1(\Z) weak^*-continuous. This is equivalent to making the natural convolution multiplication on \ell_1(\Z) separately weak*-continuous and so turning \ell_1(\Z) into a dual Banach algebra. We call such preduals \emph{shift-invariant}. It is known that the only shift-invariant predual arising from the standard duality between C_0(K) (for countable locally compact K) and \ell_1(\Z) is c_0(\Z). We provide an explicit construction of an uncountable family of distinct preduals which do make the bilateral shift weak^*-continuous. Using Szlenk index arguments, we show that merely as Banach spaces, these are all isomorphic to c_0. We then build some theory to study such preduals, showing that they arise from certain semigroup compactifications of \Z. This allows us to produce a large number of other examples, including non-isometric preduals, and preduals which are not Banach space isomorphic to c_0.
