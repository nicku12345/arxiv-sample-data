Someone knowledgeable in nonstandard analysis may get the feeling that in the nonlinear theory of generalized functions, too often one works directly on the nets and spends effort to obtain results that should be clear from general principles. We want to show that such principles can indeed be introduced and to illustrate their role to solve problems.   This text is intended as a tutorial on the use of nonstandard principles in generalized function theory intended for researchers in the nonlinear theory of generalized functions.
