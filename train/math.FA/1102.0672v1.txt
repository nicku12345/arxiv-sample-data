In this paper we study the density of polynomials in some L^2(M) spaces. Two choices of the measure M and polynomials are considered: 1) a (N\times N) matrix non-negative Borel measure on \mathbb{R} and vector-valued polynomials p(x) = (p_0(x),p_1(x),...,p_{N-1}(x)), p_j(x) are complex polynomials, N\in \mathbb{N}; 2) a scalar non-negative Borel measure in a strip \Pi = \{(x,\phi):\ x\in \mathbb{R}, \phi\in [-\pi,\pi) \} , and power-trigonometric polynomials: p(x,\phi) = \sum_{m=0}^\infty \sum_{n=-\infty}^\infty \alpha_{m,n} x^m e^{in\phi}, \alpha_{m,n}\in \mathbb{C}, where all but finite number of \alpha_{m,n} are zeros. We prove that polynomials are dense in L^2(M) if and only if M is a canonical solution of the corresponding moment problem. Using descriptions of canonical solutions, we get conditions for the density of polynomials in L^2(M). For this purpose, we derive a model for commuting self-adjoint and unitary operators with a spectrum of a finite multiplicity.
