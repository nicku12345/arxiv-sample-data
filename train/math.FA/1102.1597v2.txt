We address an open problem posed recently by Almeida and H\"ast\"o in \cite{AlHa10}. They defined the spaces \ellqp of variable integrability and summability and showed that \|\cdot|\ellqp\| is a norm if q is constant almost everywhere or if \esssup_{x\in\R^n}1/p(x)+1/q(x)\le 1. Nevertheless, the natural conjecture (expressed also in \cite{AlHa10}) is that the expression is a norm if p(x),q(x)\ge 1 almost everywhere. We show, that \|\cdot|\ellqp\| is a norm, if 1\le q(x)\le p(x) for almost every x\in\R^n. Furthermore, we construct an example of p(x) and q(x) with \min(p(x),q(x))\ge 1 for every x\in\R^n such that the triangle inequality does not hold for \|\cdot|\ellqp\|.
