Rajchman measures of locally compact Abelian groups are studied for almost a century now, and they play an important role in the study of trigonometric series. Eymard's influential work allowed generalizing these measures to the case of \emph{non-Abelian} locally compact groups G. The Rajchman algebra of G, which we denote by B_0(G), is the set of all elements of the Fourier-Stieltjes algebra that vanish at infinity.   In the present article, we characterize the locally compact groups that have amenable Rajchman algebras. We show that B_0(G) is amenable if and only if G is compact and almost Abelian. On the other extreme, we present many examples of locally compact groups, such as non-compact Abelian groups and infinite solvable groups, for which B_0(G) fails to even have an approximate identity.
