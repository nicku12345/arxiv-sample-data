A sequence (x_{n}) of points in a topological group is called \Delta-quasi-slowly oscillating if (\Delta x_{n}) is quasi-slowly oscillating, and is called quasi-slowly oscillating if (\Delta x_{n}) is slowly oscillating. A function f defined on a subset of a topological group is quasi-slowly (respectively, \Delta-quasi-slowly) oscillating continuous if it preserves quasi-slowly (respectively, \Delta-quasi-slowly) oscillating sequences, i.e. (f(x_{n})) is quasi-slowly (respectively, \Delta-quasi-slowly) oscillating whenever (x_{n}) is. We study these kinds of continuities, and investigate relations with statistical continuity, lacunary statistical continuity, and some other types of continuities in metrizable topological groups.
