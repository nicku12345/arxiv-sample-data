We study optimal algorithms in adaptive sampling recovery of smooth functions defined on the unit d-cube {\II}^d:= [0,1]^d. The recovery error is measured in the quasi-norm \|\cdot\|_q of L_q := L_q(\II^d). For B a subset in L_q, we define a sampling algorithm of recovery with the free choice of sample points and recovering functions from B as follows. For each f from the quasi-normed Besov space B^\alpha_{p,\theta}, we choose n sample points. This choice defines n sampled values. Based on these sample points and sampled values, we choose a function from B for recovering f. The choice of n sample points and a recovering function from B for each f \in B^\alpha_{p,\theta} defines a n-sampling algorithm S_n^B by functions in B. If \Phi = \{\phi_k\}_{k \in K} is a family of elements in L_q, let \Sigma_n(\Phi) be the non-linear set of linear combinations of n free terms from \Phi, that is \Sigma_n(\Phi):= \{\, \phi = \sum_{j=1}^n a_j \phi_{k_j}: \ k_j \in K \, \}. Denote by {\mathcal G} the set of all families \Phi in L_q such that the intersection of \Phi with any finite dimensional subspace in L_q is a finite set, and by \Cc(B^\alpha_{p,\theta}, L_q) the set of all continuous mappings from B^\alpha_{p,\theta} into L_q. We define the quantity \nu_n(B^\alpha_{p,\theta},L_q) := \inf_{\Phi \in {\mathcal G}} \inf_{S_n^B \in \Cc(X, L_q): B= \Sigma_n(\Phi)} \sup_{\|f\|_{B^\alpha_{p,\theta}} \le 1} \ \|f - S_n^B(f)\|_q. Let 0 < p,q, \theta \le \infty  and \alpha > d/p. Then we prove the asymptotic order  \nu_n(B^\alpha_{p,\theta},L_q) \asymp n^{- \alpha / d}. We also obtained the asymptotic order of quantities of optimal recovery by S_n^B in terms of best n-term approximation as well of other non-linear n-widths.
