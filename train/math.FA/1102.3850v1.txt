This paper is concerned with the study of M-structures in spaces of polynomials. More precisely, we discuss for E and F Banach spaces, whether the class of weakly continuous on bounded sets n-homogeneous polynomials, \mathcal P_w(^n E, F), is an M-ideal in the space of continuous n-homogeneous polynomials \mathcal P(^n E, F). We show that there is some hope for this to happen only for a finite range of values of n. We establish sufficient conditions under which the problem has positive and negative answers and use the obtained results to study the particular cases when E=\ell_p and F=\ell_q or F is a Lorentz sequence space d(w,q). We extend to our setting the notion of property (M) introduced by Kalton which allows us to lift M-structures from the linear to the vector-valued polynomial context. Also, when \mathcal P_w(^n E, F) is an M-ideal in \mathcal P(^n E, F) we prove a Bishop-Phelps type result for vector-valued polynomials and relate norm-attaining polynomials with farthest points and remotal sets.
