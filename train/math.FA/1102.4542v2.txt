A famous result due to Grothendieck asserts that every continuous linear operator from \ell_{1} to \ell_{2} is absolutely (1,1)-summing. If n\geq2, however, it is very simple to prove that every continuous n-linear operator from \ell_{1}\times...\times\ell_{1} to \ell_{2} is absolutely (1;1,...,1) -summing, and even absolutely (\frac{2}% {n};1,...,1) -summing. In this note we deal with the following problem:   Given a positive integer n\geq2, what is the best constant g_{n}>0 so that every n-linear operator from \ell_{1}\times...\times\ell_{1} to \ell_{2} is absolutely (g_{n};1,...,1) -summing?   We prove that g_{n}\leq\frac{2}{n+1} and also obtain an optimal improvement of previous recent results (due to Heinz Juenk \mathit{et} \mathit{al}, Geraldo Botelho \mathit{et} \mathit{al} and Dumitru Popa) on inclusion theorems for absolutely summing multilinear operators.
