In this survey, at first we review to many examples which have been made on cone metric spaces to verify some properties of cones on real Banach spaces and cone metrics and second, in continue like as examples that sandwich theorem doesn't hold and we shall present an other example that comparison test doesn't hold with an example for normal cones.
