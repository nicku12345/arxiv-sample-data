Let E and F be Banach lattices. Let G be a vector sublattice of E and T: G\rightarrow F be an order continuous positive compact (resp. weakly compact) operators. We show that if G is an ideal or an order dense sublattice of E, then T has a norm preserving compact (resp. weakly compact) positive extension to E which is likewise order continuous on E. In particular, we prove that every compact positive orthomorphism on an order dense sublattice of E extends uniquely to a compact positive orthomorphism on E.
