Let 1<p\not=2<\infty, \epsilon>0 and let T:\ell_p(\ell_2)\overset{into}{\rightarrow}L_p[0,1] be an isomorphism. Then there is a subspace Y\subset \ell_p(\ell_2) (1+\epsilon)-isomorphic to \ell_p(\ell_2) such that: T_{|Y} is an (1+\epsilon)-isomorphism and T(Y) is K_p-complemented in L_p[0,1], with K_p depending only on p. Moreover, K_p\le (1+\epsilon)\gamma_p if p>2 and K_p\le (1+\epsilon)\gamma_{p/(p-1)} if 1<p<2, where \gamma_r is the L_r norm of a standard Gaussian variable.
