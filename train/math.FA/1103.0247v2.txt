A cardinal k is called a Kunen cardinal if the sigma-algebra on k x k generated by all products AxB, coincides with the power set of k x k. For any cardinal k, let C(2^k) be the Banach space of all continuous real-valued functions on the Cantor cube 2^k. We prove that k is a Kunen cardinal if and only if the Baire sigma-algebra on C(2^k) for the pointwise convergence topology coincides with the Borel sigma-algebra on C(2^k) for the norm topology. Some other links between Kunen cardinals and measurability in Banach spaces are also given.
