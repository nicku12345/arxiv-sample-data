Let B_Y denote the unit ball of a normed linear space Y. A symmetric, bounded, closed, convex set A in a finite dimensional normed linear space X is called a {\it sufficient enlargement} for X if, for an arbitrary isometric embedding of X into a Banach space Y, there exists a linear projection P:Y\to X such that P(B_Y)\subset A. Each finite dimensional normed space has a minimal-volume sufficient enlargement which is a parallelepiped, some spaces have "exotic" minimal-volume sufficient enlargements. The main result of the paper is a characterization of spaces having "exotic" minimal-volume sufficient enlargements in terms of Auerbach bases.
