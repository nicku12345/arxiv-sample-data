We prove that the composition of a quasi-nearly subharmonic function and a quasiregular mappings of bounded multiplicity is quasi-nearly subharmonic. Also, we prove that if u\circ f is quasi-nearly subharmonic for all quasi-nearly subharmonic u and f satisfies some additional conditions, then f is quasiconformal. Similar results are further established for the class of regularly oscillating functions.
