We show that for spaces with 1-unconditional bases lushness, the alternative Daugavet property and numerical index~1 are equivalent. In the class of rearrangement invariant (r.i.)\ sequence spaces the only examples of spaces with these properties are c_0, \ell_1 and \ell_\infty. The only lush r.i.\ separable function space on [0,1] is L_1[0,1]; the same space is the only r.i.\ separable function space on [0,1] with the Daugavet property over the reals.
