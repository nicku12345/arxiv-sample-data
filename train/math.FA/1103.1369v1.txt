We develop a d-variable analog of the two-component de Bran-ges-Rovnyak reproducing kernel Hilbert space associated with a Schur-class function on the unit disk. In this generalization, the unit disk is replaced by the unit ball in d-dimensional complex Euclidean space, and the Schur class becomes the class of contractive multipliers on the Drury-Arveson space over the ball. We also develop some results on a model theory for commutative row contractions which are not necessarily completely noncoisometric (the case considered in earlier work of Bhattacharyya, Eschmeier and Sarkar)
