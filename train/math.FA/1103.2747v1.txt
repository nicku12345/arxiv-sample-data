We continue our previous study of improved Hardy, Rellich and Uncertainty principle inequalities on a Riemannian manifold M, started in \cite{Kombe-Ozaydin}.   In the present paper we prove new weighted Hardy-Poincar\'e, Rellich type inequalities as well as improved version of our Uncertainty principle inequalities on a Riemannian manifold M. In particular, we obtain sharp constants for these inequalities on the hyperbolic space \mathbb{H}^n.
