In the present paper our aim is to explore some spectral properties of the family two-particle discrete Schr\"odinger operators h^{\mathrm{d}}(k)=h^{\mathrm{d}}_0(k)+ \mathbf{v}, k\in \T^\mathrm{d}, on the \mathrm{d} dimensional lattice \Z^{\mathrm{d}}, \mathrm{d}\geq 1, k being the two-particle quasi-momentum. Under some condition in the case k\in \T^{\mathrm{d}}\setminus (-\pi,\pi)^{\mathrm{d}}, we establish necessary and sufficient conditions for existence of infinite discrete spectrum of the operator h^{\mathrm{d}}(k).
