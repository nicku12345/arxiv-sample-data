Let G be a locally compact, compactly generated group of polynomial growth and let \omega be a weight on G. Under proper assumptions on the weight \omega, the Banach space L^p(G,\omega) is a Banach \ast-algebra. In this paper we give examples of such weighted L^p-algebras and we study some of their harmonic analysis properties, such as symmetry, existence of functional calculus, regularity, weak Wiener property, Wiener property, existence of minimal ideals of a given hull.
