Let (\Omega,{\cal F},P) be a probability space and L^{0}({\cal F},R) the algebra of equivalence classes of real-valued random variables on (\Omega,{\cal F},P). When L^{0}({\cal F},R) is endowed with the topology of convergence in probability, we prove an intermediate value theorem for a continuous local function from L^{0}({\cal F},R) to L^{0}({\cal F},R). As applications of this theorem, we first give several useful expressions for modulus of random convexity, then we prove that a complete random normed module (S,\|\cdot\|) is random uniformly convex iff L^{p}(S) is uniformly convex for each fixed positive number p such that 1<p<+\infty.
