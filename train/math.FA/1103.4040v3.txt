In this paper we prove coincidence results concerning spaces of absolutely summing multilinear mappings between Banach spaces. The nature of these results arises from two distinct approaches: the coincidence of two \textit{a priori} different classes of summing multilinear mappings and the summability of all multilinear mappings defined on products of Banach spaces. Optimal generalizations of known results are obtained. We also introduce and explore new techniques in the field, for example a technique to extend coincidence results for linear, bilinear and even trilinear mappings to general multilinear ones.
