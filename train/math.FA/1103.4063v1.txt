For a compact group G we define the Beurling-Fourier algebra A_\omega(G) on G for weights \omega defined on the dual \what G and taking positive values. The classical Fourier algebra corresponds to the case \omega is the constant weight 1. We study the Gelfand spectrum of the algebra realizing it as a subset of the complexification G_{\mathbb C} defined by McKennon and Cartwright and McMullen. In many cases, such as for polynomial weights, the spectrum is simply G. We discuss the questions when the algebra A_\omega(G) is symmetric and regular. We also obtain various results concerning spectral synthesis for A_\omega(G).
