We study divergence properties of Fourier series on Cantor-type fractal measures, also called mock Fourier series. We show that in some cases the L^1-norm of the corresponding Dirichlet kernel grows exponentially fast, and therefore the Fourier series are not even pointwise convergent. We apply these results to the Lebesgue measure to show that a certain rearrangement of the exponential functions, which we call scrambled Fourier series, have a corresponding Dirichlet kernel whose L^1-norm grows exponentially fast, which is much worse than the known logarithmic bound. The divergence properties are related to the Mahler measure of certain polynomials and to spectral properties of Ruelle operators.
