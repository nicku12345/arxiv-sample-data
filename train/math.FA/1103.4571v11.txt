It is well known that a line in \mathbb R^2 is not a set of injectivity for the spherical means for odd functions about that line. We prove that any line passing through the origin is a set of injectivity for the twisted spherical means (TSM) for functions f\in L^2(\mathbb C), whose each of spectral projection  e^{\frac{1}{4}|z|^2}f\times\varphi_k is a polynomial. Then, we prove that any Coxeter system of even number of lines is a set of injectivity for the TSM for L^q(\mathbb C),~1\leq q\leq2.
