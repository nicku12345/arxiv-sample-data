Let \mu be a compactly supported absolutely continuous probability measure on {\Bbb R}^n, we show that \mu admits Fourier frames if and only if its Radon-Nikodym derivative is upper and lower bounded almost everywhere on its support. As a consequence, we prove that if an equal weight absolutely continuous self-similar measure on {\Bbb R}^1 admits Fourier frame, then the measure must be a characteristic function of self-similar tile. In particular, this shows for almost everywhere 1/2<\lambda<1, the \lambda-Bernoulli convolutions cannot admit Fourier frames.
