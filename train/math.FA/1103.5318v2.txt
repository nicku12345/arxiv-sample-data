In this paper, we present a geometric form of the Hahn-Banach extension theorem for L^{0}-linear functions and prove that the geometric form is equivalent to the analytic form of the Hahn-Banach extension theorem. Further, we use the geometric form to give a new proof of a known basic strict separation theorem in random locally convex modules. Finally, using the basic strict separation theorem we establish the Goldstine-Weston theorem in random normed modules under the two kinds of topologies----the (\epsilon,\lambda)-topology and the locally L^{0}-convex topology, and also provide a counterexample showing that the Goldstine-Weston theorem under the locally L^{0}-convex topology can only hold for random normed modules with the countable concatenation property.
