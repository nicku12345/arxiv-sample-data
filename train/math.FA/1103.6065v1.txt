In this paper we present a method to obtain Banach spaces of universal and almost-universal disposition with respect to a given class \mathfrak M of normed spaces. The method produces, among other, the Gurari\u{\i} space \mathcal G (the only separable Banach space of almost-universal disposition with respect to the class \mathfrak F of finite dimensional spaces), or the Kubis space \mathcal K (under {\sf CH}, the only Banach space with the density character the continuum which is of universal disposition with respect to the class \mathfrak S of separable spaces). We moreover show that \mathcal K is not isomorphic to a subspace of any C(K)-space -- which provides a partial answer to the injective space problem-- and that --under {\sf CH}-- it is isomorphic to an ultrapower of the Gurari\u{\i} space.   We study further properties of spaces of universal disposition: separable injectivity, partially automorphic character and uniqueness properties.
