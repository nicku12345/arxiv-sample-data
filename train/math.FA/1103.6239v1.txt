It is shown that, for maximally monotone linear relations defined on a general Banach space, the monotonicities of dense type, of negative-infimum type, and of Fitzpatrick-Phelps type are the same and equivalent to monotonicity of the adjoint. This result also provides affirmative answers to two problems: one posed by Phelps and Simons, and the other by Simons.
