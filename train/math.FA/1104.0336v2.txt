Multivariable, real-valued functions induce matrix-valued functions defined on the space of d-tuples of n-times-n pairwise-commuting self-adjoint matrices. We examine the geometry of this space of matrices and conclude that the best notion of differentiation of these matrix-valued functions is differentiation along curves. We prove that a C^1 real-valued function always induces a C^1 matrix function and give an explicit formula for the derivative. We also show that every real-valued C^m function defined on an open rectangle in the plane induces a matrix-valued function that can be m-times continuously differentiated along C^m curves.
