By definition, admissible matrix groups are those that give rise to a wavelet-type inversion formula. This paper investigates necessary and sufficient admissibility conditions for abelian matrix groups. We start out by deriving a block diagonalization result for commuting real valued matrices. We then reduce the question of deciding admissibility to the subclass of connected and simply connected groups, and derive a general admissibility criterion for exponential solvable matrix groups. For abelian matrix groups with real spectra, this yields an easily checked necessary and sufficient characterization of admissibility. As an application, we sketch a procedure how to check admissibility of a matrix group generated by finitely many commuting matrices with positive spectra.
