We define and study the metric, or extreme version of the notion of a projective normed module. The relevant definition takes into account the exact value of the norm of the module in question, in contrast with the standard known definition that is formulated in terms of norm topology. After some preliminary observations and discussion of the case where the base normed algebra A is just the field of complex numbers, we concentrate on the case of the next degree of complication, where A is a sequence algebra, satisfying some natural conditions. The main results give a full characterization of extremely projective objects within the subcategory of the category of non-degenerate normed A-modules, consisting of the so-called homogeneous modules. We consider two cases, `non-complete' and `complete', and the respective answers turn out to be essentially different. In particular, all Banach non-degenerate homogeneous modules, consisting of sequences, are extremely projective within the category of Banach non-degenerate homogeneous modules. However, neither of them is extremely projective within the category of all normed non-degenerate homogeneous modules, when it is infinite-dimensional. On the other hand, submodules of these modules, consisting of finite sequences, are extremely projective within the latter category.
