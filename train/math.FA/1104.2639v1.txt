We show that if K is Rosenthal compact which can be represented by functions with countably many discontinuities then every Radon measure on K is countably determined. We also present an alternative proof of the result stating that every Radon measure on an arbitrary Rosenthal compactum is of countable type. Our approach is based on some caliber-type properties of measures, parameterized by separable metrizable spaces.
