Let E be a Banach function space on a probability measure space (\Omega ,\Sigma,\mu). Let X be a Banach space and E(X) be the associated K\"{o}the-Bochner space. An operator on E(X) is called a multiplication operator if it is given by multiplication by a function in L^{\infty}(\mu). In the main result of this paper, we show that an operator T on E(X) is a multiplication operator if and only if T commutes with L^{\infty}(\mu) and leaves invariant the cyclic subspaces generated by the constant vector-valued functions in E(X). As a corollary we show that this is equivalent to T satisfying a functional equation considered by Calabuig, Rodr\'{i}guez, S\'{a}nchez-P\'{e}rez in [3].
