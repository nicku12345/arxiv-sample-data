In this article we investigate an action of some operators (not necessary to be linear or sublinear) in the so-called (Bilateral) Grand Lebesgue Spaces (GLS), in particular, double weight Fourier operators, maximal operators, imbedding operators etc. We intend to calculate an exact or at least weak exact values for correspondent imbedding constant. We obtain also interpolation theorems for GLS spaces.We construct several examples to show the exactness of offered estimations. In two last sections we introduce anisotropic Grand Lebesgue Spaces, obtain some estimates for Fourier two-weight inequalities and calculate Boyd's multidimensional indices for this spaces.
