We continue the analysis in [H. Osaka and J. Tomiyama, Double piling structure of matrix monotone functions and of matrix convex functions, Linear and its Applications 431(2009), 1825 - 1832] in which the followings three assertions at each label n are discussed: (1)f(0) \leq 0 and f is n-convex in [0, \alpha). (2)For each matrix a with its spectrum in [0, \alpha) and a contraction c in the matrix algebra M_n, f(c^*ac) \leq c^*f(a)c. (3)The function f(t)/t (= g(t)) is n-monotone in (0, \alpha). We know that two conditions (2) and (3) are equivalent and if f with f(0) \leq 0 is n-convex, then g is (n -1)-monotone. In this note we consider several extra conditions on g to conclude that the implication from (3) to (1) is true. In particular, we study a class Q_n([0, \alpha)) of functions with conditional positive Lowner matrix which contains the class of matrix n-monotone functions and show that if f \in Q_{n+1}([0, \alpha)) with f(0) = 0 and g is n-monotone, then f is n-convex. We also discuss about the local property of n-convexity.
