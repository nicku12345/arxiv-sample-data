It is well known that the quadratic Wasserstein distance W_2 (\mathord{\boldsymbol{\cdot}}, \mathord{\boldsymbol{\cdot}}) is formally equivalent, for infinitesimally small perturbations, to some weighted H^{-1} homogeneous Sobolev norm. In this article I show that this equivalence can be integrated to get non-asymptotic comparison results between these distances. Then I give an application of these results to prove that the W_2 distance exhibits some localisation phenomenon: if \mu and \nu are measures on \mathbf{R}^n and \varphi \colon \mathbf{R}^n \to \mathbf{R}_+ is some bump function with compact support, then under mild hypotheses, you can bound above the Wasserstein distance between \varphi \cdot \mu and \varphi \cdot \nu by an explicit multiple of W_2 (\mu, \nu).
