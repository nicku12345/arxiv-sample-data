We analyse several examples of separable Banach spaces, some of them new, and relate them to several dichotomies obtained in the previous paper Banach spaces without minimal subspaces, by classifying them according to which side of the dichotomies they fall. This paper may be seen as a more empirical continuation of Banach spaces without minimal subspaces, in which our stress is on the study of examples for the new classes of Banach spaces considered in that work.
