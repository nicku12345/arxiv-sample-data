Let g be a totally positive function of finite type. Then the Gabor set \{e^{2\pi i \beta l t} g(t-\alpha k), k,l \in Z \} is a frame for L^2(R), if and only if \alpha \beta <1. This result is a first positive contribution to a conjecture of I.\ Daubechies from 1990. So far the complete characterization of lattice parameters \alpha, \beta  that generate a frame has been known for only six window functions g. Our main result now provides an uncountable class of functions. As a byproduct of the proof method we derive new sampling theorems in shift-invariant spaces and obtain the correct Nyquist rate.
