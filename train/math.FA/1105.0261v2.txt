Tent spaces of vector-valued functions were recently studied by Hyt\"onen, van Neerven and Portal with an eye on applications to H^\infty-functional calculi. This paper extends their results to the endpoint cases p = 1 and p = \infty along the lines of earlier work by Harboure, Torrea and Viviani in the scalar-valued case. The main result of the paper is an atomic decomposition in the case p = 1, which relies on a new geometric argument for cones. A result on the duality of these spaces is also given.
