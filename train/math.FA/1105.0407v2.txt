Let a be a semi-almost periodic matrix function with the almost periodic representatives a_l and a_r at -\infty and +\infty, respectively. Suppose p:\mathbb{R}\to(1,\infty) is a slowly oscillating exponent such that the Cauchy singular integral operator S is bounded on the variable Lebesgue space L^{p(\cdot)}(\mathbb{R}). We prove that if the operator aP+Q with P=(I+S)/2 and Q=(I-S)/2 is Fredholm on the variable Lebesgue space L_N^{p(\cdot)}(\mathbb{R}), then the operators a_lP+Q and a_rP+Q are invertible on standard Lebesgue spaces L_N^{q_l}(\mathbb{R}) and L_N^{q_r}(\mathbb{R}) with some exponents q_l and q_r lying in the segments between the lower and the upper limits of p at -\infty and +\infty, respectively.
