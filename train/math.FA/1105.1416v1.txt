Using an integral formula on a homogeneous Siegel domain, we show a necessary and sufficient condition for composition operators on the weighted Bergman space of a minimal bounded homogeneous domain to be compact. To describe the compactness of composition operators, we see a boundary behavior of the Bergman kernel.
