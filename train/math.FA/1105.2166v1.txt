In this work, firstly in the direct sum of Hilbert spaces of vector-functions L^{2} (H,(-\infty,a_{1})) \oplus L^{2} (H,(a_{2},b_{2}))\oplus^{2} (H,(a_{3},+\infty)), - \infty<a_{1}<a_{2}<b_{2}<a_{3}<+\infty all normal extensions of the minimal operator generated by linear singular multipoint formally normal differential expression l=(l_{1},l_{2},l_{3}),l_{k} = \frac{d}{dt}+A_{k} with a selfadjoint operator coefficient A_k k=1,2,3 in any Hilbert space H, are described in terms of boundary values. Later structure of the spectrum of these extensions is investigated.
