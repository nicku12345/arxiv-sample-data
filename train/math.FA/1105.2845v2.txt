Two new applications of a technique for spaceability are given in this paper. For the first time this technique is used in the investigation of the algebraic genericity property of the weak form of Peano's theorem on the existence of solutions of the ODE u'=f(u) on c_0. The space of all continuous vector fields f on c_0 is proved to contain a closed \mathfrak{c}-dimensional subspace formed by fields f for which -- except for the null field -- the weak form of Peano's theorem fails to be true. The second application generalizes known results on the existence of closed \mathfrak{c}-dimensional subspaces inside certain subsets of \ell_p(X)-spaces, 0 < p < \infty, to the existence of closed subspaces of maximal dimension inside such subsets.
