In this paper we get the sharp estimates of the p-adic Hardy and Hardy-Littlewood-P\'olya operators on L^q(|x|^{\alpha}_pdx). Also, we prove that the commutators generated by the p-adic Hardy operators (Hardy-Littlewood-P\'olya operators) and the central BMO functions are bounded on L^q(|x|^{\alpha}_pdx), more generally, on Herz spaces.
