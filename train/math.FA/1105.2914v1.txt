In 1955, A. Grothendieck has shown that if the linear operator T in a Banach subspace of an L_\infty-space is 2/3-nuclear then the trace of T is well defined and is equal to the sum of all eigenvalues \{\mu_k(T)\} of T. V.B. Lidski\v{\i}, in 1959, proved his famous theorem on the coincidence of the trace of the S_1-operator in L_2(\nu) with its spectral trace \sum_{k=1}^\infty \mu_k(T). We show that for p\in[1,\infty] and s\in (0,1] with 1/s=1+|1/2-1/p|, and for every s-nuclear operator T in every subspace of any L_p(\nu)-space the trace of T is well defined and equals the sum of all eigenvalues of T.
