We prove that if a super-Poincar\'e inequality is satisfied by an infinitesimal generator -A of a symmetric contracting semigroup then it implies a corresponding super-Poincar\'e inequality for -g(A) with any Bernstein function g. We also study the converse statement. We deduce similar results for the Nash-type inequality. Our results applied to fractional powers of A and to \log(I+A) and thus generalize some results of Biroli and Maheux, and Wang 2007. We provide several examples.
