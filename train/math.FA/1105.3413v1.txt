If E is a Banach space, any element x^{**} in its bidual E^{**} is an affine function on the dual unit ball B_{E^*} that might possess variety of descriptive properties with respect to the weak* topology. We prove several results showing that descriptive properties of x^{**} are quite often determined by the behaviour of x^{**} on the set of extreme points of B_{E^*}, generalizing thus results of J. Saint Raymond and F. Jellett. We also prove several results on relation between Baire classes and intrinsic Baire classes of L_1-preduals which were introduced by S.A. Argyros, G. Godefroy and H.P. Rosenthal. Also, several examples witnessing natural limits of our positive results are presented.
