The aim of this paper is to give the text of a recent introduction to nonlinear generalized functions exposed in my talk in the congress gf2011, which was asked by several participants. Three representative topics were presented: two recalls "Nonlinear generalized functions and their connections with distribution theory", "Examples of applications", and a recent development: "Locally convex topologies and compactness: a functional analysis of nonlinear generalized functions".
