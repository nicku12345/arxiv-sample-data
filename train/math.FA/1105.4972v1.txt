In this paper, we give a polynomial lower bound for the resonances of -\Delta perturbed by an obstacle in even-dimensional Euclidean spaces, n\geq4. The proof is based on a Poisson Summation Formula which comes from the Hadamard factorization theorem in the open upper complex plane. We take advantage of the singularity of regularized wave trace to give the pole/resonance counting function over the principal branch of logarithmic plane a lower bound.
