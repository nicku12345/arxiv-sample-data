In this short note we prove the result stated in the title; that is, for every p>0 there exists an infinite dimensional closed linear subspace of L_{p}[0,1] every nonzero element of which does not belong to \bigcup\limits_{q>p} L_{q}[0,1]. This answers in the positive a question raised in 2010 by R. M. Aron on the spaceability of the above sets (for both, the Banach and quasi-Banach cases). We also complete some recent results from \cite{BDFP} for subsets of sequence spaces.
