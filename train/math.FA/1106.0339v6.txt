A bounded linear operator T on a Banach space X is called an (m, p)-isometry if it satisfies the equation \sum_{k=0}^{m}(-1)^{k} {m \choose k}\|T^{k}x\|^{p} = 0, for all x \in X. In this paper we study the structure which underlies the second parameter of (m, p)-isometric operators. We concentrate on determining when an (m, p)-isometry is a (\mu, q)-isometry for some pair (\mu, q). We also extend the definition of (m, p)-isometry, to include p=\infty and study basic properties of these (m, \infty)-isometries.
