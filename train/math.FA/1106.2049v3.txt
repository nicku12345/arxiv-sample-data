We explicitly describe all Hilbert function spaces that are interpolation spaces with respect to a given couple of Sobolev inner product spaces considered over \mathbb{R}^{n} or a half-space in \mathbb{R}^{n} or a bounded Euclidean domain with Lipschitz boundary. We prove that these interpolation spaces form a subclass of isotropic H\"ormander spaces. They are parametrized with a radial function parameter which is OR-varying at +\infty and satisfies some additional conditions. We give explicit examples of intermediate but not interpolation spaces.
