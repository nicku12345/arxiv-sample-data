In this paper we show that every g-frame for an \linebreak infinite dimensional Hilbert space \mathcal{H} can be written as a sum of three g-orthonormal bases for \mathcal{H}. Also, we prove that every g-frame can be represented as a linear combination of two g-orthonormal bases if and only if it is a g-Riesz basis. Further, we show each g-Bessel multiplier is a Bessel multiplier and investigate the inversion of g-frame multipliers. Finally, we introduce the concept of controlled g-frames and weighted g-frames and show that the sequence induced by each controlled g-frame (resp. weighted g-frame) is a controlled frame (resp. weighted frame).
