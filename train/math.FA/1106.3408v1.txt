We discuss the equivalence of the Feichtinger Conjecture with a weaker variant and we show its connection with a conjecture of Agler--McCarthy--Seip concerning complete Nevanlinna--Pick reproducing kernel spaces. Some new examples of sequences of normalized reproducing kernels satisfying the Feichtinger Conjecture are consequently obtained.
