We study the bounded operators on weighted spaces Lw^2 on R^+ commuting either with the right translations St or left translations and we establish the existence of a symbol for these operators. We characterize completely the spectrum of St. We give also a spectral results for the left translations and for the bounded operators commuting with the semi-group (St) or with the semi-group of the left translations.
