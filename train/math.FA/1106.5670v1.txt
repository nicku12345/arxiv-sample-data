Let (X, d) be a complete metric space, and let S, T : X to CB(X) be a duality of multi-valued generalized weak contraction mappings or a duality of generalized weak contraction mappings. We discuss the common fixed points and endpoints of the two kinds of multi-valued weak mappings. Our results extend and improve some results given by Daffer and Kaneko (1995), Rouhani and Moradi (2010), and Moradi and Khojasteh (2011).
