Motivated by the Schwartz space of tempered distributions \mathscr S^\prime and the Kondratiev space of stochastic distributions \mathcal S_{-1} we define a wide family of nuclear spaces which are increasing unions of (duals of) Hilbert spaces \mathscr H_p^\prime,p\in\mathbb N, with decreasing norms |\cdot|_{p}. The elements of these spaces are functions on a free commutative monoid. We characterize those rings in this family which satisfy an inequality of the form |f * g|_{p} \leq A(p-q) |f|_{q}|g|_{p} for all p\ge q+d, where * denotes the convolution in the monoid, A(p-q) is a strictly positive number and d is a fixed natural number (in this case we obtain commutative topological \mathbb C-algebras). Such an inequality holds in \mathcal S_{-1}, but not in \mathscr S^\prime. We give an example of such a ring which contains \mathscr S^\prime. We characterize invertible elements in these rings and present applications to linear system theory
