We prove a criterion for continuity of bilinear maps on countable direct sums of topological vector spaces. As a first application, we get a new proof for the fact (due to Hirai et al. 2001) that the map taking a pair of test functions on R^n to their convolution is continuous. The criterion also allows an open problem by K.-H. Neeb to be solved: If E is a locally convex space, regard the tensor algebra T(E) as the locally convex direct sum of the projective tensor powers T^j(E) of E. We show that T(E) is a topological algebra if and only if every sequence of continuous seminorms on E has an upper bound. In particular, if E is metrizable, then T(E) is a topological algebra if and only if E is normable. Also, T(E) is a topological algebra whenever E is a DFS-space, or a hemicompact k-space.
