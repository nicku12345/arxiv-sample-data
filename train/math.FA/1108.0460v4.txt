First, we consider some fundamental properties including dual spaces, complex interpolations of \alpha-modulation spaces M^{s,\alpha}_{p,q} with 0<p,q \le \infty. Next, necessary and sufficient conditions for the scaling property and the inclusions between \alpha_1-modulation and \alpha_2-modulation spaces are obtained. Finally, we give some criteria for \alpha-modulation spaces constituting multiplication algebra. As a by-product, we show that there exists an \alpha-modulation space which is not an interpolation space between modulation and Besov spaces.
