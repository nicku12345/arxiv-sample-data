In this paper we bring together results about the density of subsemigroups of abelian Lie groups, the minimal number of topological generators of abelian Lie groups and a result about actions of algebraic groups. We find the minimal number of generators of a finitely generated abelian semigroup or group of matrices with a dense or a somewhere dense orbit by computing the minimal number of generators of a dense subsemigroup (or subgroup) of the connected component of the identity of its Zariski closure.
