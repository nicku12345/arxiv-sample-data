In this paper, we construct maximally monotone operators that are not of Gossez's dense-type (D) in many nonreflexive spaces. Many of these operators also fail to possess the Br{\o}nsted-Rockafellar (BR) property. Using these operators, we show that the partial inf-convolution of two BC--functions will not always be a BC--function. This provides a negative answer to a challenging question posed by Stephen Simons. Among other consequences, we deduce that every Banach space which contains an isomorphic copy of the James space \mathbf{J} or its dual \mathbf{J}^*, or c_0 or its dual \ell^1, admits a non type (D) operator.
