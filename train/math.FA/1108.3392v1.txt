We prove that there is x_{\phi}\in X for which (*)\frac{d u(t)}{dt}= A u(t) + \phi (t) , u(0)=x has on \r a mild solution u\in C_{ub} (\r,X) (that is bounded and uniformly continuous) with u(0)=x_{\phi}, where A is the generator of a holomorphic C_0-semigroup (T(t))_{t\ge 0} on {X} with sup _{t\ge 0} \,||T(t)|| < \infty, \phi\in L^{\infty} (\r,{X}) and i\,sp (\phi)\cap \sigma (A)=\emptyset. As a consequence it is shown that if \n is the space of almost periodic AP, almost automorphic AA, bounded Levitan almost periodic LAP_b, certain classes of recurrent functions REC_b and \phi \in L^{\infty} (\r,{X}) such that M_h \phi:=(1/h)\int_0^h \phi (\cdot+s)\, ds \in \n for each h >0, then u\in \n\cap C_{ub}. These results seem new and generalize and strengthen several recent Theorems.
