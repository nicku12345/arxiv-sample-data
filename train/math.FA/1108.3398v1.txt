We prove that u'= A u + \phi  has on \Bbb{R} a mild solution u_{\phi}\in BUC (\Bbb{R},X) (that is bounded and uniformly continuous), where A is the generator of a C_0-semigroup on the Banach space {X} with resolvent satisfying ||R(it,A)||= O(|t|^{-\theta}), |t|\to \infty , with some \theta > 1/2, \phi\in L^{\infty} (\Bbb{R},{X}) and i\,sp (\phi)\cap \sigma (A)=\emptyset. As a consequence it is shown that if {\Cal F} is the space of almost periodic, almost automorphic, bounded Levitan almost periodic or certain classes of recurrent functions and \phi as above is such that M_h \phi:=(1/h)\int_0^h \phi (\cdot+s)\, ds \in \Cal {F} for each h >0, then u_{\phi}\in \Cal {F}\cap BUC (\Bbb{R},X). These results seem new and strengthen several recent theorems.
