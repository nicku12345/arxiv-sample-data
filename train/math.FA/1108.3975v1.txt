We use the Aron-Berner extension to prove that the set of extreme points of the unit ball of the space of integral polynomials over a real Banach space X is \{\pm \phi^k: \phi \in X^*, \| \phi\|=1\}. With this description we show that, for real Banach spaces X and Y, if X is a non trivial M-ideal in Y, then \hat\bigotimes^{k,s}_{\epsilon_{k,s}} X (the k-th symmetric tensor product of X endowed with the injective symmetric tensor norm) is \emph{never} an M-ideal in \hat\bigotimes^{k,s}_{\epsilon_{k,s}} Y. This result marks up a difference with the behavior of non-symmetric tensors since, when X is an M-ideal in Y, it is known that \hat\bigotimes^k_{\epsilon_k} X (the k-th tensor product of X endowed with the injective tensor norm) is an M-ideal in \hat\bigotimes^k_{\epsilon_k} Y. Nevertheless, if X is Asplund, we prove that every integral k-homogeneous polynomial in X has a unique extension to Y that preserves the integral norm. We explicitly describe this extension.   We also give necessary and sufficient conditions (related with the continuity of the Aron-Berner extension morphism) for a fixed k-homogeneous polynomial P belonging to a maximal polynomial ideal \Q(^kX) to have a unique norm preserving extension to \Q(^kX^{**}). To this end, we study the relationship between the bidual of the symmetric tensor product of a Banach space and the symmetric tensor product of its bidual and show (in the presence of the BAP) that both spaces have `the same local structure'. Other applications to the metric and isomorphic theory of symmetric tensor products and polynomial ideals are also given.
