In the study of concentration properties of isotropic log-concave measures, it is often useful to first ensure that the measure has super-Gaussian marginals. To this end, a standard preprocessing step is to convolve with a Gaussian measure, but this has the disadvantage of destroying small-ball information. We propose an alternative preprocessing step for making the measure seem super-Gaussian, at least up to reasonably high moments, which does not suffer from this caveat: namely, convolving the measure with a random orthogonal image of itself. As an application of this "inner-thickening", we recover Paouris' small-ball estimates.
