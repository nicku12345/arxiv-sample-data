We study the reduced Beurling spectra sp_{\Cal {A},V} (F) of functions   F \in L^1_{loc} (\jj,X) relative to certain function spaces \Cal{A}\st L^{\infty}(\jj,X) and V\st L^1 (\r) and compare them with other spectra including the weak Laplace spectrum. Here \jj is \r_+ or \r and X is a Banach space. If F belongs to the space  \f'_{ar}(\jj,X) of absolutely regular distributions and has uniformly continuous indefinite integral with 0\not\in sp_{\A,\f(\r)} (F) (for example if F is slowly oscillating and \A is \{0\} or C_0 (\jj,X)), then F is ergodic. If F\in \f'_{ar}(\r,X) and M_h F (\cdot)= \int_0^h F(\cdot+s)\,ds is bounded for all h > 0 (for example if F is ergodic) and if sp_{C_0(\r,X),\f} (F)=\emptyset, then {F}*\psi \in C_0(\r,X) for all \psi\in \f(\r).   We show that tauberian theorems for Laplace transforms follow from results about reduced spectra. Our results are more general than previous ones and we demonstrate this through examples
