Let M be a Riemmanian manifold with bounded geometry. We consider a generalization of Paley-Wiener functions and Lagrangian splines on M. An analog of the Paley-Wiener theorem is given. We also show that every Paley-Wiener function on a manifold is uniquely determined by its values on some discrete sets of points.   The main result of the paper is a generalization of the Whittaker-Shannon formula for reconstruction of a Paley-Wiener function from its values on a discrete set. It is shown that every Paley- Wiener function on M is a limit of some linear combinations of fundamental solutions of the powers of the Laplace-Beltrami operator.   The result is new even in the one-dimentional case.
