It is shown that a band limited function on a non-compact symmetric space can be reconstructed in a stable way from some countable sets of values of its convolution with certain distributions of compact support. A reconstruction method in terms of frames is given which is a generalization of the classical result of Duffin-Schaeffer about exponential frames on intervals. The second reconstruction method is given in terms of polyharmonic average splines.
