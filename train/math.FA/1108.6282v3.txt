In this paper we consider series expansions via a frame and a non-frame and the possibilities for interchange of the two sequences, both in the Hilbert and Banach space setting. First we give a characterization of frame-related concepts in Banach spaces (atomic decompositions, Banach frames, X_d-Riesz bases, X_d-frames, X_d-Bessel sequences, and sequences satisfying the lower X_d-frame condition). We also determine necessary and sufficient conditions for operators to preserve the type of the concepts listed above. Then we discuss differences and relationships between expansions in a Banach space and its dual space when interchanging the involved sequences. Finally, we apply some of the results to answer problems in Hilbert frame theory. We show that interchanging a frame and a non-Bessel sequence in series expansions is not always possible (leading to differentiation of analysis- and synthesis-pseudo-duals of a frame) and determine an appropriate subspace where interchange can be done. We characterize all the synthesis-pseudo-duals of a frame and determine a class of frames whose synthesis-pseudo-duals (resp. analysis-pseudo-duals) are necessarily frames. We also investigate connections between the lower frame condition and series expansions. Examples are given to illustrate statements in the paper and to show the optimality of some results.
