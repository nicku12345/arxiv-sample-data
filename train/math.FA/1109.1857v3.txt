In this paper we study two separate problems on interpolation. We first give some new equivalences of Stout's Theorem on necessary and sufficient conditions for a sequence of points to be an interpolating sequence on a finite open Riemann surface. We next turn our attention to the question of interpolation for reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces on the polydisc and provide a collection of equivalent statements about when it is possible to interpolation in the Schur-Agler class of the associated reproducing kernel Hilbert space.
