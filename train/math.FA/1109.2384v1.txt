This short but self-contained survey presents a number of elegant matrix/operator inequalities for general convex or concave functions, obtained with a unitary orbit technique. Jensen, sub or super-additivity type inequalities are considered. Some of them are substitutes to classical inequalities (Choi, Davis, Hansen-Pedersen) for operator convex or concave functions. Various trace, norm and determinantal inequalities are derived. Combined with an interesting decomposition for positive semi-definite matrices, several results for partitioned matrices are also obtained.
