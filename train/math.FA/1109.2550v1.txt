In this note we introduce grand grand Morrey spaces, in the spirit of the grand Lebesgue spaces. We prove a kind of \textit{reduction lemma} which is applicable to a variety of operators to reduce their boundedness in grand grand Morrey spaces to the corresponding boundedness in Morrey spaces. As a result of this application, we obtain the boundedness of the Hardy-Littlewood maximal operator and Calder\'on-Zygmund operators in the framework of grand grand Morrey spaces.
