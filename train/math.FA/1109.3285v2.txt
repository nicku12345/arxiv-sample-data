We construct a sequence {\phi_i(\cdot-j)\mid j\in{\ZZ}, i=1,...,r} which constitutes a p-frame for the weighted shift-invariant space [V^p_{\mu}(\Phi)=\Big{\sum\limits_{i=1}^r\sum\limits_{j\in{\mathbb{Z}}}c_i(j)\phi_i(\cdot-j) \Big| {c_i(j)}_{j\in{\mathbb{Z}}}\in\ell^p_{\mu}, i=1,...,r\Big}, p\in[1,\infty],] and generates a closed shift-invariant subspace of L^p_\mu(\mathbb{R}). The first construction is obtained by choosing functions \phi_i, i=1,...,r, with compactly supported Fourier transforms \hat{\phi}_i, i=1,...,r. The second construction, with compactly supported \phi_i,i=1,...,r, gives the Riesz basis.
