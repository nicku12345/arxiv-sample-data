This paper continues the study of infinite dimensional bicomplex Hilbert spaces introduced in previous articles on the topic. Besides obtaining a Best Approximation Theorem, the main purpose of this paper is to obtain a bicomplex analogue of the Riesz-Fischer Theorem. There are many statements of the Riesz-Fischer (R-F) Theorem in the literature, some are equivalent, some are consequences of the original versions. The one referred to in this paper is the R-F Theorem which establishes that the spaces l^2 is the canonical model space.
