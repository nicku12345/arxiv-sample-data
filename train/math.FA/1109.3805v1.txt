In this paper we prove the following: let \omega(t) be a continuous function, increasing in [0,\infty) and \omega(+0)=0. Then there exists a series of the form\sum_{k=-\infty}^\infty C_ke^{ikx} with \sum_{k=-\infty}^\infty C^2_k \omega(|C_k|)<\infty, C_{-k}=\bar{C}_k, with the following property: for each \epsilon>0 a weighted function \mu(x), 0<\mu(x) \le1,| \{x\in[0,2\pi]: \mu(x)\not =1 \}| <\epsilon  can be constructed, so that the series is universal in the weighted space L_\mu^1[0,2\pi] with respect to rearrangements.
