We give estimates for the essential norms of a positive Toeplitz operator on the Bergman space of a minimal bounded homogeneous domain in terms of the Berezin transform or the averaging function of the symbol. Using these estimates, we also give necessary and sufficient conditions for the positive Toeplitz operators to be compact.
