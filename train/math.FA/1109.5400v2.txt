The goal of this paper is to present an isometric representation of the dual space to Ces\`aro function space C_{p,w}, 1<p<\infty, induced by arbitrary positive weight function w on interval (0,l) where 0<l\leqslant\infty. For this purpose given a strictly decreasing nonnegative function \Psi on (0,l), the notion of essential \Psi-concave majorant \hat f of a measurable function f is introduced and investigated. As applications it is shown that every slice of the unit ball of the Ces\`aro function space has diameter 2. Consequently Ces\`aro function spaces do not have the Radon-Nikodym property, are not locally uniformly convex and they are not dual spaces.
