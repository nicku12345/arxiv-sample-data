We consider local "complementary" generalized Morrey spaces {\dual \cal M}_{\{x_0\}}^{p(\cdot),\om}(\Om) in which the p-means of function are controlled over \Om\backslash B(x_0,r) instead of B(x_0,r), where \Om \subset \Rn is a bounded open set, p(x) is a variable exponent, and no monotonicity type conditio is imposed onto the function \om(r) defining the "complementary" Morrey-type norm. In the case where \om is a power function, we reveal the relation of these spaces to weighted Lebesgue spaces. In the general case we prove the boundedness of the Hardy-Littlewood maximal operator and Calderon-Zygmund singular operators with standard kernel, in such spaces. We also prove a Sobolev type {\dual \cal M}_{\{x_0\}}^{p(\cdot),\om} (\Om)\rightarrow {\dual \cal M}_{\{x_0\}}^{q(\cdot),\om} (\Om)-theorem for the potential operators I^{\al(\cdot)}, also of variable order. In all the cases the conditions for the boundedness are given it terms of Zygmund-type integral inequalities on \om(r), which do not assume any assumption on monotonicity of \om(r).
