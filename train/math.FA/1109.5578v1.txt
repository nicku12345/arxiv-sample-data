We introduce and study properties of certain new harmonic function spaces on products of upper half-spaces.Norm estimates for the so-called expanded Bergman projections are obtained.Sharp theorems on multipliers acting on certain Sobolev type spaces of harmonic functions on the unit ball are also obtained
