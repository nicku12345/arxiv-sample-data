As is known, the class of weights for Morrey type spaces \mathcal{L}^{p,\lb}(\rn)  for which the maximal and/or singular operators are bounded, is different from the known Muckenhoupt class A_p of such weights for the Lebesgue spaces L^p(\Om). For instance, in the case of power weights |x-a|^\nu, \ a\in \mathbb{R}^1, the singular operator (Hilbert transform) is bounded in L^p(\mathbb{R}), if and only if -1<\nu <p-1, while it is bounded in the Morrey space \mathcal{L}^{p,\lb}(\mathbb{R}), 0\le \lb<1, if and only if the exponent \al runs the shifted interval \lb-1<\nu <\lb+p-1. A description of all the admissible weights similar to the Muckenhoupt class A_p is an open problem. In this paper, for the one-dimensional case, we introduce the class A_{p,\lb} of weights, which turns into the Muckenhoupt class A_p when \lb=0 and show that the belongness of a weight to A_{p,\lb} is necessary for the boundedness of the Hilbert transform in the one-dimensional case. In the case n>1 we also provide some \lb-dependent \textit{\`a priori} assumptions on weights and give some estimates of weighted norms \|\chi_B\|_{p,\lb;w} of the characteristic functions of balls.
