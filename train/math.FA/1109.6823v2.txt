Let E be a Banach space with the c^1-norm \|\cdot\| in  E \backslash \{0\} and S(E)=\{e\in E: \|e\|=1\}. In this paper, a geometry characteristic for E is presented by using a geometrical construct of S(E). That is, the following theorem holds : the norm of E is of c^1 in  E \backslash \{0\} if and only if S(E) is a c^1-submanifold of E, with {\rm codim}S(E)=1. The theorem is very clear, however, its proof is non-trivial, which shows an intrinsic connection between the continuous differentiability of the norm \|\cdot\| in  E \backslash \{0\} and differential structure of S(E).
