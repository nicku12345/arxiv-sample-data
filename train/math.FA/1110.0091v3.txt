Using methods from the theory of commutative graded Banach algebras, we obtain a generalization of the two dimensional Borsuk-Ulam theorem as follows: Let \phi:S^{2} \rightarrow S^{2} be a homeomorphism of order n and \lambda\neq 1 be an nth root of the unity, then for every complex valued continuous function f on S^{2} the function \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} \lambda^{i}f(\phi^{i}(x)) must be vanished at some point of S^{2}. We give a generalization in term of action of compact groups. We also discuss about some noncommutative versions of the Borsuk- Ulam theorem
