Let \mathcal{M}(\mathbb{R}^n) be the class of bounded away from one and infinity functions p:\mathbb{R}^n\to[1,\infty] such that the Hardy-Littlewood maximal operator is bounded on the variable Lebesgue space L^{p(\cdot)}(\mathbb{R}^n). We show that if a belongs to the H\"ormander class S_{\rho,\delta}^{n(\rho-1)} with 0<\rho\le 1, 0\le\delta<1, then the pseudodifferential operator \Op(a) is bounded on the variable Lebesgue space L^{p(\cdot)}(\R^n) provided that p\in\cM(\R^n). Let \mathcal{M}^*(\mathbb{R}^n) be the class of variable exponents p\in\mathcal{M}(\mathbb{R}^n) represented as 1/p(x)=\theta/p_0+(1-\theta)/p_1(x) where p_0\in(1,\infty), \theta\in(0,1), and p_1\in\mathcal{M}(\mathbb{R}^n). We prove that if a\in S_{1,0}^0 slowly oscillates at infinity in the first variable, then the condition \[ \lim_{R\to\infty}\inf_{|x|+|\xi|\ge R}|a(x,\xi)|>0 \] is sufficient for the Fredholmness of \Op(a) on L^{p(\cdot)}(\R^n) whenever p\in\cM^*(\R^n). Both theorems generalize pioneering results by Rabinovich and Samko \cite{RS08} obtained for globally log-H\"older continuous exponents p, constituting a proper subset of \mathcal{M}^*(\mathbb{R}^n).
