We develop a complete Fredholm and invertibility theory for Toeplitz+Hankel operators T(a)+H(b) on the Hardy space H^p, 1<p<\infty, with piecewise continuous functions a,b defined on the unit circle which are subject to the condition a(t)a(t^{-1})=b(t)b(t^{-1}), |t|=1. In particular, in the case of Fredholmness, formulas for the defect numbers are established. The results are applied to several important examples.
