Let \mu be a Borel probability measure with compact support. We consider exponential type orthonormal bases, Riesz bases and frames in L^2(\mu). We show that if L^2(\mu) admits an exponential frame, then \mu must be of pure type. We also classify various \mu that admits either kind of exponential bases, in particular, the discrete measures and their connection with integer tiles. By using this and convolution, we construct a class of singularly continuous measures that has an exponential Riesz basis but no exponential orthonormal basis. It is the first of such kind of examples.
