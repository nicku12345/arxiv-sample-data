Given the standard Gaussian measure \gamma on the countable product of lines \mathbb{R}^{\infty} and a probability measure g \cdot \gamma absolutely continuous with respect to \gamma, we consider the optimal transportation T(x) = x + \nabla \varphi(x) of g \cdot \gamma to \gamma. Assume that the function |\nabla g|^2/g is \gamma-integrable. We prove that the function \varphi is regular in a certain Sobolev-type sense and satisfies the classical change of variables formula g = {\det}_2(I + D^2 \varphi) \exp \bigl(\mathcal{L} \varphi - 1/2 |\nabla \varphi|^2 \bigr). We also establish sufficient conditions for the existence of third order derivatives of \varphi.
