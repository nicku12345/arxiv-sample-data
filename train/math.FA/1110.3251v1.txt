We study the space of p-compact operators \mathcal K_p, using the theory of tensor norms and operator ideals. We prove that \mathcal K_p is associated to /d_p, the left injective associate of the Chevet-Saphar tensor norm d_p (which is equal to g_{p'}'). This allows us to relate the theory of p-summing operators with that of p-compact operators. With the results known for the former class and appropriate hypothesis on E and F we prove that \mathcal K_p(E;F) is equal to \mathcal K_q(E;F) for a wide range of values of p and q, and show that our results are sharp. We also exhibit several structural properties of \mathcal K_p. For instance, we obtain that \mathcal K_p is regular, surjective, totally accessible and characterize its maximal hull \mathcal K_p^{max} as the dual ideal of the p-summing operators, \Pi_p^{dual}. Furthermore, we prove that \mathcal K_p coincides isometrically with \mathcal {QN}_p^{dual}, the dual ideal of the quasi p-nuclear operators.
