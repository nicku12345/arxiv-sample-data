In this article we introduce and investigate a new class of rearrangement invariant (r.i.) Banach function spaces, so-called Composed Grand Lebesgue Spaces (CGLS), in particular, Integral Grand Lebesgue Spaces (IGLS), which are some generalizations of known Grand Lebesgue Spaces (GLS).   We consider the fundamental functions of CGLS, calculate its Boyd's indices, obtain the norm boundedness some (regular and singular) operators in this spaces, investigate the conjugate and associate spaces, show that CGLS obeys the absolute continuous norm property etc.
