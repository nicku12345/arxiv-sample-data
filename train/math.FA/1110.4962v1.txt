Let f_{\bf c}(r)=\sum_{n=0}^\infty e^{c_n}r^n be an analytic function; {\bf c}=(c_n)\in l_\infty. We assume that r is some logarithmically convex and lower semicontinuous functional on a locally convex topological space L. In this paper we derive a formula on the Legendre-Fenchel transform of a functional \hat{\lambda}({\bf c},\phi)=\ln f_{\bf c}(e^{\lambda(\phi)}), where \lambda(\phi)=\ln r(\phi) (\phi\in L). In this manner we generalize to the infinite case Theorem 3.1 from \cite{OZ1}.
