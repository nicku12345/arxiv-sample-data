We say that a function f:[0,1]\rightarrow \R is \emph{nowhere L^q} if, for each nonvoid open subset U of [0,1], the restriction f|_U is not in L^q(U). For a fixed 1 \leq p <\infty, we will show that the set  S_p\doteq {f \in L^p[0,1]: f is nowhere L^q, for each p<q \leq \infty},  united with {0}, contains an isometric and complemented copy of \ell_p. In particular, this improves a result from G. Botelho, V. F\'avaro, D. Pellegrino, and J. B. Seoane-Sep\'ulveda, L_p[0,1]\setminus \cup_{q>p} L_q[0,1] is spaceable for every p>0, preprint, 2011., since S_p turns out to be spaceable. In addition, our result is a generalization of one of the main results from S. G{\l}\c{a}b, P. L. Kaufmann, and L. Pellegrini, Spaceability and algebrability of sets of nowhere integrable functions, preprint, 2011.
