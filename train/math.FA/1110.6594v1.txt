We show that the symmetrized product AB+BA of two positive operators A and B is positive if and only if f(A+B)\leq f(A)+f(B) for all non-negative operator monotone functions f on [0,\infty) and deduce an operator inequality. We also give a necessary and sufficient condition for that the composition f\circ g of an operator convex function f on [0,\infty) and a non-negative operator monotone function g on an interval (a,b) is operator monotone and give some applications.
