The Lifting Problem for Commuting Subnormals (LPCS) asks for necessary and sufficient conditions for a pair of subnormal operators on Hilbert space to admit commuting normal extensions. \ We study LPCS within the class of commuting 2-variable weighted shifts \mathbf{T} \equiv (T_1,T_2) with subnormal components T_1 and T_2, acting on the Hilbert space \ell ^2(\mathbb{Z}^2_+) with canonical orthonormal basis \{e_{(k_1,k_2)}\}_{k_1,k_2 \geq 0} . \ The \textit{core} of a commuting 2-variable weighted shift \mathbf{T}, c(\mathbf{T}), is the restriction of \mathbf{T} to the invariant subspace generated by all vectors e_{(k_1,k_2)} with k_1,k_2 \geq 1; we say that c(\mathbf{T}) is of \textit{tensor form} if it is unitarily equivalent to a shift of the form (I \otimes W_\alpha, W_\beta \otimes I), where W_\alpha and W_\beta are subnormal unilateral weighted shifts. \ Given a 2-variable weighted shift \mathbf{T} whose core is of tensor form, we prove that LPCS is solvable for \mathbf{T} if and only if LPCS is solvable for any power \mathbf{T}^{(m,n)}:=(T^m_1,T^n_2) (m,n\geq 1). \
