Function spaces are central topic in analysis. Often those spaces and related analysis involves symmetries in form of an action of a Lie group. Coorbit theory as introduced by Feichtinger and Gr\"ochenig and then later extended in [3] gives a unified method to construct Banach spaces of functions based on representations of Lie groups. In this article we identify the homogeneous Besov spaces on stratified Lie groups introduced in [13] as coorbit spaces in the sense of [3] and use this to derive atomic decompositions for the Besov spaces.
