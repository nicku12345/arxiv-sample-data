This paper generalizes results for alternate dual frames in Hilbert spaces on the situation of a Banach space. Additionally some properties of synthesys operator associated with alternate dual frame are investigated. The main result is that for a given cross-frame in Banach space we can not find such strongly continuous uniformely bounded one-parameter group of operators that the vectors from this cross-frame are eigenvectors of group's operators.
