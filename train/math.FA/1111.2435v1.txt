Unitary matrices which are zero below the secondary diagonal (Hessenberg unitary matrices) have many uses in analysis. Given a set of needed conditions on a unitary matrix, this algorithm will give the sparsest unitary matrix. We give an algorithm for constructing all real Hessenberg unitary matrices. The n\times n unitary matrices given by the algorithm have n-1 variables which can be chosen to give additional properties needed for a particular application.
