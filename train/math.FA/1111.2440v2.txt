In this paper we examine the general theory of continuous frame multipliers in Hilbert space. These operators are a generalization of the widely used notion of (discrete) frame multipliers. Well-known examples include Anti-Wick operators, STFT multipliers or Calder\'on- Toeplitz operators. Due to the possible peculiarities of the underlying measure spaces, continuous frames do not behave quite as well as their discrete counterparts. Nonetheless, many results similar to the discrete case are proven for continuous frame multipliers as well, for instance compactness and Schatten class properties. Furthermore, the concepts of controlled and weighted frames are transferred to the continuous setting.
