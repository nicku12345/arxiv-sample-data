The Bohnenblust-Hille inequality was obtained in 1931 and (in the case of real scalars) asserts that for every positive integer N and every m-linear mapping T:\ell_{\infty}^{N}\times...\times\ell_{\infty}^{N}\rightarrow \mathbb{R} one has (\sum\limits_{i_{1},...,i_{m}=1}^{N}|T(e_{i_{^{1}}},...,e_{i_{m}})|^{\frac{2m}{m+1}})^{\frac{m+1}{2m}}\leq C_{m}\VertT\Vert, for some positive constant C_{m}. Since then, several authors obtained upper estimates for the values of C_{m}. However, the novelty presented in this short note is that we provide lower (and non-trivial) bounds for C_{m}.
