We consider finitely generated shift-invariant spaces (SIS) with additional invariance in L^2(\R^d). We prove that if the generators and their translates form a frame, then they must satisfy some stringent restrictions on their behavior at infinity. Part of this work (non-trivially) generalizes recent results obtained in the special case of a principal shift-invariant spaces in L^2(\R) whose generator and its translates form a Riesz basis.
