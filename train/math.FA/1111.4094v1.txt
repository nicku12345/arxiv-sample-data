Let \omega be a continuous weight on \mathbb R^+ and let L^1(\omega) be the corresponding convolution algebra. By results of Gr{\o}nb{\ae}k and Bade & Dales the continuous derivations from L^1(\omega) to its dual space L^{\infty}(1/\omega) are exactly the maps of the form (D_{\phi}f)(t)=\int_0^{\infty}f(s)\,\frac{s}{t+s}\,\phi(t+s)\,ds\qquad\text{(t\in\mathbb R^+ and f\in L^1(\omega))} for some \phi\in L^{\infty}(1/\omega). Also, every D_{\phi} has a unique extension to a continuous derivation \bar{D}_{\phi}:M(\omega)\to L^{\infty}(1/\omega) from the corresponding measure algebra. We show that a certain condition on \phi implies that \bar{D}_{\phi} is weak-star continuous. The condition holds for instance if \phi\in L_0^{\infty}(1/\omega). We also provide examples of functions \phi for which \bar{D}_{\phi} is not weak-star continuous. Similarly, we show that D_{\phi} and \bar{D}_{\phi} are compact under certain conditions on \phi. For instance this holds if \phi\in C_0(1/\omega) with \phi(0)=0. Finally, we give various examples of functions \phi for which D_{\phi} and \bar{D}_{\phi} are not compact.
