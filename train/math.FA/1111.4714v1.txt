It is shown that for each separable Banach space X not admitting \ell_1 as a spreading model there is a space Y having X as a quotient and not admitting any \ell_p for 1 \leq p < \infty or c_0 as a spreading model.   We also include the solution to a question of W.B. Johnson and H.P. Rosenthal on the existence of a separable space not admitting as a quotient any space with separable dual.
