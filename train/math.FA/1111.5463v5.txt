In this paper, we show the strong and weak type boundedness of T_{\Omega,\alpha}^A and M_{\Omega,\alpha}^A, the multilinear fractional integral operators and the corresponding fractional maximal operators, on the two weights weighted Morrey space. Furthermore, we also obtain the mulitilinear singular integral operators T_{\Omega}^A and the corresponding maximal operators M_{\Omega}^A are strong bounded operators on the same spaces.
