Let \cal A and \cal B be Banach algebras. A linear map T:{\cal A} \rightarrow {\cal B} is called separating or disjointness preserving if ab=0 implies Ta\;Tb = 0 for all a,b\in {\cal A}. In this paper, we study a new class of regular Tauberian algebras and prove that some well-known Banach algebras in harmonic analysis belong to this class. We show that a bijective separating map between these algebras turns out to be continuous and the maximal ideal spaces of underlying algebras are homeomorphic. By imposing extra conditions on these algebras, we find a more thorough characterization of separating maps. The existence of a bijective separating map also leads to the existence of an algebraic isomorphism in some cases.
