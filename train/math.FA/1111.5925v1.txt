Let {\mathcal L} A(H) be the Lebesgue-Fourier space of a hypergroup H considered as a Banach space on H. In addition {\mathcal L}A(H) is a Banach algebra with the multiplication inherited from L^1(H). Moreover If H is a regular Fourier hypergroup, {\mathcal L}A(H) is a Banach algebra with pointwise multiplication. We study the amenability and character amenability of these two Banach algebras.
