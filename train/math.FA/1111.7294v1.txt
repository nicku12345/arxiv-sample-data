For E a Hilbert space, let \mathcal{H}(E) denote the Segal-Bargmann space (also known as the Fock space) over E, which is a reproducing kernel Hilbert space with kernel K(x,y)=\exp(< x,y>) for x,y in E. If \phi is a mapping on E, the composition operator C_{\phi} is defined by C_{\phi}h = h\circ\phi for h\in \mathcal{H}(E) for which h\circ\phi also belongs to \mathcal{H}(E). We determine necessary and sufficient conditions for the boundedness and compactness of C_{\phi}. Our results generalize results obtained earlier by Carswell, MacCluer and Schuster for finite dimensional spaces E.
