We collect and extend results on the limit of \sigma^{1-k}(1-\sigma)^k |v|_{l+\sigma,p,\Omega}^p as \sigma tends to 0^+ or 1^-, where \Omega is \mathbb{R}^n or a smooth bounded domain, k is 0 or 1, l is a nonnegative integer, p\in[1,\infty), and |.|_{l+\sigma,p,\Omega} is the intrinsic semi-norm of order l+\sigma in the Sobolev space W^{l+\sigma,p}(\Omega). In general, the above limit is equal to c[v]^p, where c and [.] are, respectively, a constant and a semi-norm that we explicitly provide. The particular case p=2 for \Omega=\mathbb{R}^n is also examined and the results are then proved by using the Fourier transform.
