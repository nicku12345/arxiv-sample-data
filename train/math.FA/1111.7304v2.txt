The classical Grothendieck inequality is viewed as a statement about representations of functions of two variables over discrete domains by integrals of two-fold products of functions of one variable. An analogous statement is proved, concerning continuous functions of two variables over general topological domains. The main result is a construction of a continuous map \Phi from l^2(A) into L^2(\Omega_A, P_A), where A is a set, \Omega_A = {-1,1}^A, and P_A is the uniform probability measure on \Omega_A, such that \sum_{\alpha \in A} x(\alpha) \bar{y}(\alpha)} = \int_{\Omega_A} \Phi(x)\Phi(\bar{y})dP_A, x \in l^2(A), y \in l^2(A), and  |\Phi(x)|_{L^{\infty}} \leq K |x|_2, x \in l^2(A), for an absolute constant K > 1. (\Phi is non-linear, and does not commute with complex conjugation.) The bilinear Parseval-like formula above is obtained by iterating the usual Parseval formula in a framework of harmonic analysis on dyadic groups. A modified construction implies a similar integral representation of the dual action between l^p and l^q, \ 1/p + 1/q= 1. Parseval-like formulas are derived in higher dimensions. These variants involve representations of functions of n variables in terms of functions of k variables, 0 < k < n. Multilinear extensions of the Grothendieck inequality are obtained, and are used to characterize the feasibility of integral representations of multilinear functionals on a Hilbert space.
