Let 1 < p \neq q < \infty  and (D, \mu) = (\{\pm 1\}, 1/2 \delta_{-1} + 1/2 \delta_1). Define by recursion: X_0 = \C and X_{n+1} = L_p(\mu; L_q(\mu; X_n)). In this paper, we show that there exist c_1=c_1(p, q)>1 depending only on p, q and  c_2 = c_2(p, q, s) depending on p, q, s, such that the \text{UMD}_s constants of X_n's satisfy c_1^n \leq C_s(X_n) \leq c_2^n for all 1 < s < \infty. Similar results will be showed for the analytic \text{UMD} constants. We mention that the first super-reflexive non-\text{UMD} Banach lattices were constructed by Bourgain. Our results yield another elementary construction of super-reflexive non-\text{UMD} Banach lattices, i.e. the inductive limit of X_n, which can be viewed as iterating infinitely many times L_p(L_q).
