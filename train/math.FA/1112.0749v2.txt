Inversion theorems of Wiener type are essential tools in analysis and number theory. We derive a weighted version of an inversion theorem of Wiener type for general Dirichlet series from that of Edwards from 1957, and we outline an alternative proof based on the duality theory of convex cones and extension techniques for characters of semigroups. Variants and arithmetical applications are described, including the case of multidimensional weighted generalized Dirichlet series.
