A definition of frames for Krein spaces is proposed, which extends the notion of J-orthonormal basis of Krein spaces. A J-frame for a Krein space (\HH, \K{\,}{\,}) is in particular a frame for \HH in the Hilbert space sense. But it is also compatible with the indefinite inner product \K{\,}{\,}, meaning that it determines a pair of maximal uniformly J-definite subspaces with different positivity, an analogue to the maximal dual pair associated to a J-orthonormal basis.   Also, each J-frame induces an indefinite reconstruction formula for the vectors in \HH, which resembles the one given by a J-orthonormal basis.
