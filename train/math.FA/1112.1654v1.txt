We study the duality of reconstruction systems, which are g-frames in a finite dimensional setting. These systems allow redundant linear encoding-decoding schemes implemented by the so-called dual reconstruction systems.   We are particularly interested in the projective reconstruction systems that are the analogue of fusion frames in this context. Thus, we focus on dual systems of a fixed projective system that are optimal with respect to erasures of the reconstruction system coefficients involved in the decoding process. We consider two different measures of the reconstruction error in a blind reconstruction algorithm.   We also study the projective reconstruction system that best approximate an arbitrary reconstruction system, based on some well known results in matrix theory. Finally, we present a family of examples in which the problem of existence of a dual projective system of a reconstruction system of this type is considered.
