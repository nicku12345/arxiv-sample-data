Given a probability measure \mu on the real line, there exists a semigroup \mu_t with real parameter t>1 which interpolates the discrete semigroup of measures \mu_n obtained by iterating its free convolution. It was shown in \cite{[BB2004]} that it is impossible that \mu_t has no mass in an interval whose endpoints are atoms. We extend this result to semigroups related to multiplicative free convolution. The proofs use subordination results.
