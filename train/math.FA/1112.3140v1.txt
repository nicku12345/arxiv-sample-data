We consider Toeplitz and Hankel operators with piecewise continuous generating functions on l^p-spaces and the Banach algebra generated by them. The goal of this paper is to provide a transparent symbol calculus for the Fredholm property and a handy formula for the Fredholm index for operators in this algebra.
