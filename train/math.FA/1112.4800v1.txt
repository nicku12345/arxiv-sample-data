Let \omega_1 be the first uncountable ordinal. By a result of Rudin, bounded operators on the Banach space C([0,\omega_1]) have a natural representation as [0,\omega_1]\times 0,\omega_1]-matrices. Loy and Willis observed that the set of operators whose final column is continuous when viewed as a scalar-valued function on [0,\omega_1] defines a maximal ideal of codimension one in the Banach algebra \mathscr{B}(C([0,\omega_1])) of bounded operators on C([0,\omega_1]). We give a coordinate-free characterization of this ideal and deduce from it that \mathscr{B}(C([0,\omega_1])) contains no other maximal ideals. We then obtain a list of equivalent conditions describing the strictly smaller ideal of operators with separable range, and finally we investigate the structure of the lattice of all closed ideals of \mathscr{B}(C([0,\omega_1])).
