We study, for a locally compact group G, the compactifications (\pi,G^\pi) associated with unitary representations \pi, which we call {\it \pi-Eberlein compactifications}. We also study the Gelfand spectra \Phi_{\mathcal{A}}(\pi)} of the uniformly closed algebras \mathcal{A}(\pi) generated by matrix coefficients of such \pi. We note that \Phi_{\mathcal{A}(\pi)}\cup\{0\} is itself a semigroup and show that the \v{S}ilov boundary of \mathcal{A}(\pi) is G^\pi. We study containment relations of various uniformly closed algebras generated by matrix coefficients, and give a new characterisation of amenability: the constant function 1 can be uniformly approximated by matrix coefficients of representations weakly contained in the left regular representation if and only if G is amenable. We show that for the universal representation \omega, the compactification (\omega,G^\omega) has a certain universality property: it is universal amongst all compactifications of G which may be embedded as contractions on a Hilbert space, a fact which was also recently proved by Megrelishvili. We illustrate our results with examples including various abelian and compact groups, and the ax+b-group. In particular, we witness algebras \fA(\pi), for certain non-self-conjugate \pi, as being generalised algebras of analytic functions.
