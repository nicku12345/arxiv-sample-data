Nonstationary Gabor frames were recently introduced in adaptive signal analysis. They represent a natural generalization of classical Gabor frames by allowing for adaptivity of windows and lattice in either time or frequency. In this paper we show a general existence result for this family of frames. We then give a perturbation result for nonstationary Gabor frames and construct nonstationary Gabor frames with non-compactly supported windows from a related painless nonorthogonal expansion. Finally, the theoretical results are illustrated by two examples of practical relevance.
