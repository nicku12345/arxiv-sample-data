We study the generalized roundness of finite metric spaces whose distance matrix D has the property that every row of D is a permutation of the first row. The analysis provides a way to characterize subsets of the Hamming cube \{ 0, 1 \}^{n} \subset \ell_{1}^{(n)} (n \geq 1) that have strict 1-negative type. The result can be stated in two ways: a subset S = \{ \vc{x}_0,\vc{x}_1,\ldots,\vc{x}_k \} of the Hamming cube \{ 0, 1 \}^{n} \subset \ell_{1}^{(n)} has generalized roundness one if and only if the vectors \{ \vc{x}_1 - \vc{x}_0,\vc{x}_2 - \vc{x}_0,\ldots,\vc{x}_k - \vc{x}_0 \} are linearly dependent in \mathbb{R}^n. Equivalently, S has strict 1-negative type if and only if the vectors \{ \vc{x}_1 - \vc{x}_0,\vc{x}_2 - \vc{x}_0,\ldots,\vc{x}_k - \vc{x}_0 \} are linearly independent in \mathbb{R}^n.
