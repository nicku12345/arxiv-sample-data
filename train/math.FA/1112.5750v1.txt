In functional analysis there are several reasonable approaches to the notion of a projective module. We show that a certain general-categorical framework contains, as particular cases, all known versions. In this scheme, the notion of a free object comes to the forefront, and in the best of categories, called freedom-loving, all projective objects are exactly retracts of free objects. We concentrate on the so-called metric version of projectivity and characterize metrically free `classical', as well as quantum (= operator) normed modules. Hitherto known the so-called extreme projectivity turns out to be, speaking informally, a kind of `asymptotically metric projectivity'.   Besides, we answer the following concrete question: what can be said about metrically projective modules in the simplest case of normed spaces? We prove that metrically projective normed spaces are exactly l_1^0(M), the subspaces of l_1(M), where M is a set, consisting of finitely supported functions. Thus in this case the projectivity coincides with the freedom.
