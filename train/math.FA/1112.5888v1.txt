Let X and Z be Banach spaces, A a closed subset of X and a mapping f:A \to Z. We give necessary and sufficient conditions to obtain a C^1 smooth mapping F:X \to Z such that F_{\mid_A}=f, when either (i) X and Z are Hilbert spaces and X is separable, or (ii) X^* is separable and Z is an absolute Lipschitz retract, or (iii) X=L_2 and Z=L_p with 1<p<2, or (iv) X=L_p and Z=L_2 with 2<p<\infty.
