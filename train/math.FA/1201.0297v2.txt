Let G be a locally compact group and also let H be a compact subgroup of G. It is shown that, if \mu is a relatively invariant measure on G/H then there is a well-defined convolution on L^1(G/H,\mu) such that the Banach space L^1(G/H,\mu) becomes a Banach algebra. We also find a generalized definition of this convolution for other L^p-spaces. Finally, we show that various types of involutions can be considered on G/H.
