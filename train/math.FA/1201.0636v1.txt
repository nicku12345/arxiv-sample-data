We give examples of results on composition operators connected with lens maps. The first two concern the approximation numbers of those operators acting on the usual Hardy space H^2. The last ones are connected with Hardy-Orlicz and Bergman-Orlicz spaces H^\psi and B^\psi, and provide a negative answer to the question of knowing if all composition operators which are weakly compact on a non-reflexive space are norm-compact.
