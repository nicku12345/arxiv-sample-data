Let H and K be locally compact groups and \tau:H\to Aut(K) be a continuous homomorphism and also let G_\tau=H\ltimes_\tau K be the semi-direct product of H and K with respect to \tau. We define left and also right \tau-convolution on L^1(G_\tau) such that L^1(G_\tau) with respect to each of them is a Banach algebra. Also we define \tau-convolution as a linear combination of the left and right \tau-convolution. We show that the \tau-convolution is commutative if and only if K is abelian and also when H and K are second countable groups, the \tau-convolution coincides with the standard convolution of L^1(G_\tau) if and only if H is the trivial group. We prove that there is a \tau-involution on L^1(G_\tau) such that L^1(G_\tau) with respect to the \tau-involution and \tau-convolution is a non-associative Banach *-algebra and also it is also shown that when K is abelian, the \tau-involution and \tau-convolution makes L^1(G_\tau) into a Jordan Banach *-algebra.
