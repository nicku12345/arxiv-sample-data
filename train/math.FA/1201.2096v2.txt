We define an {\it (X_1,\Theta, X_2)-frame} with Banach spaces X_2\subseteq X_1, |\cdot|_1 \leq |\cdot|_2, and a BK-space (\Theta, \snorm[\cdot]). Then by the use of decreasing sequences of Banach spaces {X_s}_{s=0}^\infty and of sequence spaces {\Theta_s}_{s=0}^\infty, we define a general Fr\' echet frame on the Fr\' echet space X_F=\bigcap_{s=0}^\infty X_s. We give frame expansions of elements of X_F and its dual X_F^*, as well of some of the generating spaces of X_F with convergence in appropriate norms. Moreover, we give necessary and sufficient conditions for a general pre-Fr\' echet frame to be a general Fr\' echet frame, as well as for the complementedness of the range of the analysis operator U:X_F\to\Theta_F.
