For an arbitrary matrix dilation, any integer n and any integer/semi-integer c, we describe all masks that are symmetric with respect to the point c and have sum rule of order n. For each such mask, we give explicit formulas for wavelet functions that are point symmetric/antisymmetric and generate frame-like wavelet system providing approximation order n. For any matrix dilations (which are appropriate for axial symmetry group on R^2 in some natural sense) and given integer n, axial symmetric/antisymmetric frame-like wavelet systems providing approximation order n are constructed. Also, for several matrix dilations the explicit construction of highly symmetric frame-like wavelet systems providing approximation order n is presented.
