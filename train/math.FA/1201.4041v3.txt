The first part of the paper is inspired by a theorem of H. Rosenthal, that if an operator on L_1[0,1] satisfies the assumption that for each measurable set A \subseteq [0,1] the restriction T \bigl|_{L_1(A)} is not an isomorphic embedding, then the operator is narrow.   (Here L_1(A) = \bigl\{x \in L_1: \,\, {\rm supp} \, x \subseteq A \bigr\}.) This leads to a natural question of finding mildest possible assumptions for operators on a given space X, which will imply that the operator is narrow. We find a partial answer to this question for operators on L_p(0,1) with 1<p<2. Namely we define a notion of a "gentle" growth of a function and we prove that for 1 < p < 2 every operator T on L_p which is unbounded from below on L_p(A), A \subseteq [0,1], by means of function having a "gentle" growth, is narrow.   In the second part of the paper we consider the question for what Banach spaces X, every operator T:L_p \lra X is narrow. We prove that for 2 < p, r < \infty every operator T: L_p\rightarrow\ell_r is narrow, which completes the list of results for operators from L_p to sequence and function Lebesgue spaces.
