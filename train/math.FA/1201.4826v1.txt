Following "An infinite dimensional Schur-Horn theorem and majorization theory", Journal of Functional Analysis 259 (2010) 3115-3162, this paper further studies majorization for infinite sequences. It extends to the infinite case classical results on "intermediate sequences" for finite sequence majorization. These and other infinite majorization properties are then linked to notions of infinite convexity and invariance properties under various classes of substochastic matrices to characterize arithmetic mean closed operator ideals and arithmetic mean at infinity closed operator ideals.
