Reflexive cones in Banach spaces are cones with weakly compact intersection with the unit ball. In this paper we study the structure of this class of cones. We investigate the relations between the notion of reflexive cones and the properties of their bases. This allows us to prove a characterization of reflexive cones in term of the absence of a subcone isomorphic to the positive cone of \ell_{1}. Moreover, the properties of some specific classes of reflexive cones are investigated. Namely, we consider the reflexive cones such that the intersection with the unit ball is norm compact, those generated by a Schauder basis and the reflexive cones regarded as ordering cones in a Banach spaces. Finally, it is worth to point out that a characterization of reflexive spaces and also of the Schur spaces by the properties of reflexive cones is given.
