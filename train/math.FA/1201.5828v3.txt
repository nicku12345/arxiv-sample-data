Let X be a metric space equipped with a metric d and a nonnegative Borel measure \mu satisfying the doubling property and let \{\mathcal{A}_t\}_{t>0}, be a generalized approximations to the identity, for example \{\mathcal{A}_t\} is a holomorphic semigroup e^{-tL} with Gaussian upper bounds generated by an operators L on L^2(X). In this paper, we introduce and study the weighted BMO space BMO_\mathcal{A}(X,w) associated to the the family \{\mathcal{A}_t\}. We show that for these spaces, the weighted John-Nirenberg inequality holds and we establish an interpolation theorem in scale of weighted L^p spaces. As applications, we prove the boundedness of two singular integrals with non-smooth kernels on the weighted BMO space BMO_\mathcal{A}(X,w).
