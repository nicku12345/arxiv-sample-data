Given a parametrized family of finite frames, we consider the optimization problem of finding the member of this family whose coefficient space most closely contains a given data vector. This nonlinear least squares problem arises naturally in the context of a certain type of radar system. We derive analytic expressions for the first and second partial derivatives of the objective function in question, permitting this optimization problem to be efficiently solved using Newton's method. We also consider how sensitive the location of this minimizer is to noise in the data vector. We further provide conditions under which one should expect the minimizer of this objective function to be unique. We conclude by discussing a related variational-calculus-based approach for solving this frame optimization problem over an interval of time.
