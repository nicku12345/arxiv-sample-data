We investigate uniform, strong, weak and almost weak stability of multiplication semigroups on Banach space valued L^p-spaces. We show that, under certain conditions, these properties can be characterized by analogous ones of the pointwise semigroups. Using techniques from selector theory, we prove a spectral mapping theorem for the point spectra of the pointwise and global semigroups and apply this as a major tool for determining almost weak stability.
