A pair of commuting operators (S,P) defined on a Hilbert space \mathcal H for which the closed symmetrized bidisc  \Gamma= \{(z_1+z_2,z_1z_2):: |z_1|\leq 1,\, |z_2|\leq 1 \}\subseteq \mathbb C^2,  is a spectral set is called a \Gamma-contraction in the literature. A \Gamma-contraction (S,P) is said to be pure if P is a pure contraction, i.e, {P^*}^n \rightarrow 0 strongly as n \rightarrow \infty . Here we construct a functional model and produce a complete unitary invariant for a pure \Gamma-contraction. The key ingredient in these constructions is an operator, which is the unique solution of the operator equation  S-S^*P=D_PXD_P, \textup{where} X\in \mathcal B(\mathcal D_P), and is called the fundamental operator of the \Gamma-contraction (S,P). We also discuss some important properties of the fundamental operator.
