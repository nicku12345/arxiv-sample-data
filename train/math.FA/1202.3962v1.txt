Let denote by S(\phi) the extremal operator defined by the compression of the unilateral shift S to the model subspace  H(\phi)=H^{2} \ominus \phi H^{2}  as the following S(\phi)f(z)=P(zf(z)), where P denotes the orthogonal projection from the Hardy space H^{2} onto  H(\phi) and \phi is an inner function on the unit disc. In this mathematical notes, we give an explicit formula of the numerical radius of the truncated shift S(\phi) in the particular case where \phi is a finite Blaschke product with unique zero and an estimate on the general case. We establish also a sharpened Schwarz-Pick operatorial inequality generalizing a U. Haagerup and P. de la Harpe result for nilpotent operators
