There have been a number of generalizations of fixed point results to the so called TVS-cone metric spaces, based on a distance function that takes values in some cone with nonempty interior (solid cone) in some topological vector space. In this paper we prove that the TVS-cone metric space can be equipped with a family of mutually equivalent (usual) metrics such that the convergence (resp. property of being Cauchy sequence, contractivity condition) in TVS sense is equivalent to convergence (resp. property of being Cauchy sequence, contractivity condition) in all of these metrics. As a consequence, we prove that if a topological vector space E and a solid cone P are given, then the category of TVS-cone metric spaces is a proper subcategory of metric spaces with a family of mutually equivalent metrics (Corollary 3.9). Hence, generalization of a result from metric spaces to TVS-cone metric spaces is meaningless. This, also, leads to a formal deriving of fixed point results from metric spaces to TVS-cone metric spaces and makes some earlier results vague. We also give a new common fixed point result in (usual) metric spaces context, and show that it can be reformulated to TVS-cone metric spaces context very easy, despite of the fact that formal (syntactic) generalization is impossible. Apart of main results, we prove that the existence of a solid cone ensures that the initial topology is Hausdorff, as well as it admits a plenty of convex open sets. In fact such topology is stronger then some norm topology.
