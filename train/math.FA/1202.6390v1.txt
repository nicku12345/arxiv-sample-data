We introduce the higher order spreading models associated to a Banach space X. Their definition is based on \ff-sequences (x_s)_{s\in\ff} with \ff a regular thin family and the plegma families. We show that the higher order spreading models of a Banach space X form an increasing transfinite hierarchy (\mathcal{SM}_\xi(X))_{\xi<\omega_1}. Each \mathcal{SM}_\xi (X) contains all spreading models generated by \ff-sequences (x_s)_{s\in\ff} with order of \ff equal to \xi. We also provide a study of the fundamental properties of the hierarchy.
