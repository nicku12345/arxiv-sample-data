The Bohnenblust--Hille (polynomial and multilinear) inequalities were proved in 1931 in order to solve Bohr's absolute convergence problem on Dirichlet series. Since then these inequalities have found applications in various fields of analysis and analytic number theory. The control of the constants involved is crucial for applications, as it became evident in a recent outstanding paper of Defant, Frerick, Ortega-Cerd\'{a}, Ouna\"{\i}es and Seip published in 2011. The present work is devoted to obtain lower estimates for the constants appearing in the Bohnenblust--Hille polynomial inequality and some of its variants. The technique that we introduce for this task is a combination of the Krein--Milman Theorem with a description of the geometry of the unit ball of polynomial spaces on \ell^2_\infty.
