An operator T \in \mathcal{B}(X) defined on a Banach space X satisfies property (gb) if the complement in the approximate point spectrum \sigma_{a}(T) of the upper semi-B-Weyl spectrum \sigma_{SBF_{+}^{-}}(T) coincides with the set \Pi(T) of all poles of the resolvent of T. In this note we continue to study property (gb) and the stability of it, for a bounded linear operator T acting on a Banach space, under perturbations by nilpotent operators, by finite rank operators, by quasi-nilpotent operators commuting with T. Two counterexamples show that property (gb) in general is not preserved under commuting quasi-nilpotent perturbations or commuting finite rank perturbations.
