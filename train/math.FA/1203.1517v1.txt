Let H be a locally compact group, K be an LCA group, \tau:H\to Aut(K) be a continuous homomorphism and G_\tau=H\ltimes_\tau K be the semi-direct product of H and K with respect to the continuous homomorphism \tau. In this article we introduce the \tau\times\hat{\tau}-time frequency group G_{\tau\times\hat{\tau}}. We define the \tau\times\hat{\tau}-continuous Gabor transform of f\in L^2(G_\tau) with respect to a window function u\in L^2(K) as a function defined on G_{\tau\times\hat{\tau}}. It is also shown that the \tau\times\hat{\tau}-continuous Gabor transform satisfies the Plancherel Theorem and reconstruction formula. This approach is tailored for choosing elements of L^2(G_\tau) as a window function. Finally, we illustrate application of these methods in the case of some well-known semi-direct product groups.
