Building on the author's recent work with Jan Maas and Jan van Neerven, this paper establishes the equivalence of two norms (one using a maximal function, the other a square function) used to define a Hardy space on \R^{n} with the gaussian measure, that is adapted to the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck semigroup. In contrast to the atomic Gaussian Hardy space introduced earlier by Mauceri and Meda, the h^{1}(\R^{n};d\gamma) space studied here is such that the Riesz transforms are bounded from h^{1}(\R^{n};d\gamma) to L^{1}(\R^{n};d\gamma). This gives a gaussian analogue of the seminal work of Fefferman and Stein in the case of the Lebesgue measure and the usual Laplacian.
