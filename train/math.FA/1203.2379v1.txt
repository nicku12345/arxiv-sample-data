The aim of this article is to prove a representation theorem for orthogonally additive polynomials in the spirit of the recent theorem on representation of orthogonally additive polynomials on Banach lattices but for the setting of Riesz spaces. To this purpose the notion of p--orthosymmetric multilinear form is introduced and it is shown to be equivalent to the orthogonally additive property of the corresponding polynomial. Then the space of positive orthogonally additive polynomials on an Archimedean Riesz space taking values on an uniformly complete Archimedean Riesz space is shown to be isomorphic to the space of positive linear forms on the n-power in the sense of Boulabiar and Buskes of the original Riesz space.
