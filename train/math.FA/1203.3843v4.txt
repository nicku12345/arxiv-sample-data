We define the finest order on inductive limits of ordered cones which makes the linear mappings monotone and gives rise to the definition of inductive limit topologies for cones. Using the polars of neighborhoods, we establish embeddings between direct sums, inductive limits and their duals. These lead us to investigate the weak topologies and the topologies of pointwise convergence in inductive limits.
