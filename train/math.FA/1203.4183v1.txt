We discuss a question which relates to Calderon's complex interpolation method. More precisely, we will consider the so-called "periodic" complex interpolation method, studied by Peetre. (Which also corresponds to the spaces obtained by Calderon's construction using Banach space valued analytic functions, but defined on an annulus instead of the strip used by Calderon.)   Cwikel showed that, using functions with a given period i\lambda in the complex method mechanism, one obtains the same interpolation spaces as in the original version of the complex method, up to equivalence of norms. He also showed that one of the constants of this equivalence will, in some cases, "blow up" as \lambda tends to zero.   We will show that the equivalence constants tend to 1 as \lambda tends to infinity. Intuitively, this means that when applying the complex method, it makes a very small difference if one restricts oneself to periodic functions, provided that the period is very large (or the corresponding annulus is very thin).
