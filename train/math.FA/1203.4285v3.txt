In this paper we first show that for a locally compact amenable group G, every proper abstract Segal algebra of the Fourier algebra on G is not approximately amenable; consequently, every proper Segal algebra on a locally compact abelian group is not approximately amenable. Then using the hypergroup generated by the dual of a compact group, it is shown that all proper Segal algebras of a class of compact groups including the 2\times 2 special unitary group, SU(2), are not approximately amenable.
