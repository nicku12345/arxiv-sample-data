We prove that b is in Lip_{\bz}(\bz) if and only if the commutator [b,L^{-\alpha/2}] of the multiplication operator by b and the general fractional integral operator L^{-\alpha/2} is bounded from the weighed Morrey space L^{p,k}(\omega) to L^{q,kq/p}(\omega^{1-(1-\alpha/n)q},\omega), where 0<\beta<1, 0<\alpha+\beta<n, 1<p<{n}/({\alpha+\beta}), {1}/{q}={1}/{p}-{(\alpha+\beta)}/{n}, 0\leq k<{p}/{q}, \omega^{{q}/{p}}\in A_1 and  r_\omega> \frac{1-k}{p/q-k}, and here r_\omega denotes the critical index of \omega for the reverse H\"{o}lder condition.
