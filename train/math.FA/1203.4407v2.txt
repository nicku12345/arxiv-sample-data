Let L be the infinitesimal generator of an analytic semigroup on L^2(R^n) with Gaussican kernel bounds, and let L^{-\alpha/2} be the fractional integrals of L for 0<\alpha<n. For any locally integrable function b, The commutators associated with L^{-\alpha/2} are defined by [b,L^{-\alpha/2}](f)(x)=b(x)L^{-\alpha/2}(f)(x)-L^{-\alpha/2}(bf)(x). When b\in BMO(\omega)(weighted BMO space) or b\in BMO, the author obtain the necessary and sufficient conditions for the boundedness of [b,L^{-\alpha/2}] on weighted Morrey spaces respectively.
