We introduce the concept of topological radical of a Banach module. This closed submodule have two description: the as the intersection of ranges of maximal contractive monomorphism (from outside) and as the union of ranges of small morphisms (from inside). This concept is a functional analytic analogue for radical of module over a unital ring and has the similar categorical properties.
