The shearlets are a special case of the wavelets with composite dilation that, among other things, have a basis-like structure and multi resolution analysis properties. These relatively new representation systems have encountered wide range of applications, generally surpassing the performance of their ancestors due to their directional sensitivity. However, little is known about their relation with spaces other than L^2. Here, we find a characterization of a kind of anisotropic inhomogeneous Triebel-Lizorkin spaces (to be defined) with the so called "shearlets on the cone" coefficients. We first prove the boundedness of the analysis and synthesis operators with the "traditional" shearlets coefficients. Then, with the development of the smooth Parseval frames of shearlets of Guo and Labate we are able to prove a reproducing identity, which was previously possible only for the L^2 case. We also find some embeddings of the (classical) dyadic spaces into these highly anisotropic spaces, and viceversa, for certain ranges of parameters. In order to keep a concise document we develop our results in the "weightless" case (w=1) and give hints on how to develop the weighted case.
