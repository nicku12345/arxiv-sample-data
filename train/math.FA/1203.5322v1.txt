In this work we study the vector-valued Hardy spaces H p (D; F) (1 \leq p \leq \infty) and their relationship with RNP, ARNP and the UMDP properties. By following the approach of Taylor in the scalar-valued case, we prove that, when F and F have the ARNP property, then H p (D; F) and H q (D; F) are canonically topologically isomorphic (for p, q \in (1, \infty) conjugate indices) if and only if F has the UMDP.
