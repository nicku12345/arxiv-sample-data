In this paper, we introduce the notion of strongly {\varphi}-convex functions with respect to c>0 and present some properties and representation of such functions. We obtain a characterization of inner product spaces involving the notion of strongly {\varphi}-convex functions. Finaly, a version of Hermite Hadamard-type inequalities for strongly {\varphi}-convex functions are established.
