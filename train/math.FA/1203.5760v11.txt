It was shown by Burchard and Fortier that the expected L^1 distance between f^* and n random polarizations of an essentially bounded function f with support in a ball of radius L is bounded by 2dm(B_{2L})||f||_{\infty}n^{-1}. The purpose of this note is to expand on that result. It is shown that the same expected L^1 distance is bounded by c_nn^{-1} with \limsup_{n\rightarrow \infty}c_n \leq 2^{d+1}||\nabla f||_1 for every f \in W_{1,1}(B_L) \cap L^{\infty}(B_L). Furthermore, the aforementioned expected L^1 distance is O(n^{-1/q}) for f \in L^p(B_L) with p>1 and \frac{1}{p} + \frac{1}{q} = 1. An exponential lower bound is provided for the expected measure of the symmetric difference between the random polarizations of measurable sets and their Schwarz symmetrization. Finally, the rate n^{-1} is shown to be, in a sense, best possible for the random polarizations of measurable sets: the expected symmetric difference between the random polarization of a ball and its corresponding Schwarz symmetrization decays at the rate n^{-1}.
