We show that, if M is a subspace lattice with the property that the rank one subspace of its operator algebra is weak* dense, L is a commutative subspace lattice and P is the lattice of all projections on a separable infinite dimensional Hilbert space, then the lattice L\otimes M\otimes P is reflexive. If M is moreover an atomic Boolean subspace lattice while L is any subspace lattice, we provide a concrete lattice theoretic description of L\otimes M in terms of projection valued functions defined on the set of atoms of M. As a consequence, we show that the Lattice Tensor Product Formula holds for \Alg M and any other reflexive operator algebra and give several further corollaries of these results.
