We show that the super fixed point property for nonexpansive mappings and for asymptotically nonexpansive mappings in the intermediate sense are equivalent. As a consequence, we obtain fixed point theorems for asymptotically nonexpansive mappings in uniformly nonsquare and uniformly noncreasy Banach spaces. The results are generalized for commuting families of asymptotically nonexpansive mappings.
