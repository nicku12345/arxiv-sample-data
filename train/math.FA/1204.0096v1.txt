In this article we develop a theory for frames in tensor product of Hilbert spaces. We show that like bases if Y_1, Y_2, \cdot \cdot \cdot, Y_n are frames for H_1,H_2, \cdot \cdot \cdot, H_n, respectively, then Y_1\otimesY_2\otimes...\otimesY_n is a frame for H_\otimes1H_2\otimes \cdot \cdot \cdot \otimesH_n. Moreover we consider the canonical dual frame in tensor product space. We further obtain a relation between the dual frames in Hilbert spaces, and their tensor product.
