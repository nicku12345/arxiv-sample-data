Koplienko gave a trace formula for perturbations of self-adjoint operators by operators of Hilbert-Schmidt class \mathcal{B}_2(\mathcal{H}). Recently Gesztesy, Pushnitski and Simon gave an alternative proof of the trace formula when the operators involved are bounded. In this article, we give a still another proof and extend the formula for unbounded case by reducing the problem to a finite dimensional one as in the proof of Krein trace formula by Voiculescu, Sinha and Mohapatra.
