In the present work we consider in L^2(\mathbb{R}_+) the Schr\"odinger operator \mathrm{H_{X,\alpha}}=-\mathrm{\frac{d^2}{dx^2}}+\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\alpha_n\delta(x-x_n). We investigate and complete the conditions of self-adjointness and nontriviality of deficiency indices for \mathrm{H_{X,\alpha}} obtained in \cite{karpiiKost}. We generalize the conditions found earlier in the special case d_n:=x_{n}-x_{n-1}=1/n, n\in \mathbb{N}, to a wider class of sequences \{x_n\}_{n=1}^\infty. Namely, for x_n=\frac{1}{n^{\gamma}\ln^\eta n} with <\gamma,\eta>\in(1/2, 1)\times(-\infty,+\infty)\:\cup\:\{1\}\times(-\infty,1], the description of asymptotic behavior of the sequence \{\alpha_n\}_{n=1}^{\infty} is obtained for \mathrm{H_{X,\alpha}} either to be self-adjoint or to have nontrivial deficiency indices.
