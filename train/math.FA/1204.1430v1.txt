In this paper we prove the Fourier restriction theorem for p=2 on Riemannian symmetric spaces of noncompact type with real rank one which extends the earlier result proved in \cite[Theorem 1.1]{KRS}. This result depends on the weak L^2 estimates of the Poisson transform of L^2 function. By using this estimate of the Poisson transform we also characterizes all weak L^2 eigenfunction of the Laplace--Beltrami operator of Riemannian symmetric spaces of noncompact type with real rank one and eigenvalue -(\lambda^2+\rho^2) for \lambda\in\R\setminus\{0\}.
