In this paper, we will show that for an operator T which is injective and has dense range, there exists an invertible operator X (in fact we can find U+K, where U is an unitary operator and K is a compact operator with norm less than a given positive real number) such that XT is strongly irreducible. As its application, strongly irreducible operators always exist in the orbit of Schauder matrices.
