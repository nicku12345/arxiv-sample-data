Let T be a bounded linear operator on a (real or complex) Banach space X. If (a_n) is a sequence of non-negative numbers tending to 0. Then, the set of x \in X such that \|T^nx\| \geqslant a_n \|T^n\| for infinitely many n's has a complement which is both \sigma-porous and Haar-null. We also compute (for some classical Banach space) optimal exponents q>0, such that for every non nilpotent operator T, there exists x \in X such that (\|T^nx\|/\|T^n\|) \notin \ell^{q}(\mathbb{N}), using techniques which involve the modulus of asymptotic uniform smoothness of X.
