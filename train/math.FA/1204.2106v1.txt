Recently Alan D. Sokal gave a very short and completely elementary proof of the uniform boundedness principle. The aim of this note is to point out that by using a similiar technique one can give a considerably short and simple proof of a stronger statement, namely a principle of condensation of singularities for certain double-sequences of non-linear operators on quasi-Banach spaces, which is a bit more general than a result of I.\,S. G\'al.
