Let (\Omega,\Sigma,\mu) be a measure space and 1< p < +\infty. In this paper we show that, under quite general conditions, the set L_{p}(\Omega) - \bigcup\limits_{1 \leq q < p}L_{q}(\Omega) is maximal spaceable, that is, it contains (except for the null vector) a closed subspace F of L_{p}(\Omega) such that \dim(F) = \dim(L_{p}(\Omega)). We also show that if those conditions are not fulfilled, then even the larger set L_p(\Omega) - L_q(\Omega), 1 \leq q < p, may fail to be maximal spaceable. The aim of the results presented here is, among others, to generalize all the previous work (since the 1960's) related to the linear structure of the sets L_{p}(\Omega) - L_{q}(\Omega) with q < p and L_{p}(\Omega) - \bigcup\limits_{1 \leq q < p}L_{q}(\Omega).
