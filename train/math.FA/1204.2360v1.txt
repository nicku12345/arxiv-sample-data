Recently in a series of papers it is observed that in many Banach spaces, which include classical spaces C(\Omega) and L_p-spaces, 1 \leq p < \infty, p \neq 2, any generalized bi-circular projection P is given by P = \frac{I+T}{2}, where I is the identity operator of the space and T is a reflection, that is, T is a surjective isometry with T^2 = I. For surjective isometries of order n \geq 3, the corresponding notion of projection is generalized n-circular projection as defined in \cite{AD}. In this paper we show that in a Banach space X, if generalized bi-circular projections are given by \frac{I+T}{2} where T is a reflection, then any generalized n-circular projection P, n \geq 3, is given by P = \frac{I+T+T^2+...+T^{n-1}}{n} where T is a surjective isometry and T^n = I. We prove our results for n=3 and for n > 3, the proof remains same except for routine modifications.
