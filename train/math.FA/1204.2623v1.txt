For two given symmetric sequence spaces E and F we study the (E,F)-multiplier space, that is the space all of matrices M for which the Schur product M\ast A maps E into F boundedly whenever A does. We obtain several results asserting continuous embedding of (E,F)-multiplier space into the classical (p,q)-multiplier space (that is when E=l_p, F=l_q). Furthermore, we present many examples of symmetric sequence spaces E and F whose projective and injective tensor products are not isomorphic to any subspace of a Banach space with an unconditional basis, extending classical results of S. Kwapie\'{n} and A. Pe{\l}czy\'{n}ski and of G. Bennett for the case when E=l_p, F=l_q.
