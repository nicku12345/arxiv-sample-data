In this article, we prove that any pair of perpendicular planes is a set of injectivity for the twisted spherical means (TSM) for L^p(\mathbb C^n) (n\geq2) with 1\leq p\leq2. Then, we imitate that any Coxeter system of even number of planes is a set of injectivity for the TSM for L^p(\mathbb C^n). We further observe that a set S_R^{2n-1}\times\mathbb C is a set of injectivity for the TSM for a ceratin class of functions on \mathbb C^{n+1}.
