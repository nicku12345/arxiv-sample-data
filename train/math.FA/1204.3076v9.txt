In this article, we review the Weyl correspondence of bigraded spherical harmonics and use it to extend the Hecke-Bochner identities for the spectral projections f\times\varphi_k^{n-1} for function f\in L^p(\mathbb C^n) with 1\leq p\leq\infty. We prove that spheres are sets of injectivity for the twisted spherical means with real analytic weight. Then, we derive a real analytic expansion for the spectral projections f\times\varphi_k^{n-1} for function f\in L^2(\mathbb C^n).
