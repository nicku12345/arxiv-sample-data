For positive definite matrices A and B, the Araki-Lieb-Thirring inequality amounts to an eigenvalue log-submajorisation relation for fractional powers \lambda(A^t B^t) \prec_{w(\log)} \lambda^t(AB), \quad 0<t\le 1, while for t\ge1, the reversed inequality holds. In this paper I generalise this inequality, replacing the fractional powers x^t by a larger class of functions. Namely, a continuous, non-negative, geometrically concave function f with domain \dom(f)=[0,x_0) for some positive x_0 (possibly infinity) satisfies \lambda(f(A) f(B)) \prec_{w(\log)} f^2(\lambda^{1/2}(AB)), for all positive semidefinite A and B with spectrum in \dom(f), if and only if 0\le xf'(x)\le f(x) for all x\in\dom(f). The reversed inequality holds for continuous, non-negative, geometrically convex functions if and only if they satisfy xf'(x)\ge f(x) for all x\in\dom(f). As an application I derive a complementary inequality to the Golden-Thompson inequality.
