Our basic element is a C^1 mapping f:X\to Y, with X,Y Banach spaces, and with derivative everywhere invertible. So f is a local diffeomorphism at every point. The aim of this paper is to find a sufficient condition for f to be injective, and so a global diffeomorphism X\to f(X), and a sufficient condition for f to be bijective and so a global diffeomorphism onto Y. This last condition is also necessary in the particular case X=Y=\R^n. In these theorems the key role is played by nonnegative auxiliary scalar coercive functions.
