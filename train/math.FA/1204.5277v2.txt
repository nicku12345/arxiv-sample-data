In this paper we introduce a new family of topological convolution algebras of the form \bigcup_{p\in\mathbb N} L_2(S,\mu_p), where S is a Borel semi-group in a locally compact group G, which carries an inequality of the type \|f*g\|_p\le A_{p,q}\|f\|_q\|g\|_p for p > q+d where d pre-assigned, and A_{p,q} is a constant. We give a sufficient condition on the measures \mu_p for such an inequality to hold. We study the functional calculus and the spectrum of the elements of these algebras, and present two examples, one in the setting of non commutative stochastic distributions, and the other related to Dirichlet series.
