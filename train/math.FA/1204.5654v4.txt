In this paper, we consider oscillating convolution operotors on the Heisenberg group H^n_a with respect to the norm \rho(x,t) = \rho_1(b x, b t) with \rho_1(x,t)= (|x|^4 + t^2)^{1/4}. We obtain L^2 boundedness properties using the oscillatory integral estimates for degenerate phases in the Euclidean setting. Our result contains an improvement of the Lyall's result for the cases \frac{a^2}{b^2} \geq C_{\beta}.
