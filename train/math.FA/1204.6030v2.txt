In this note we prove that \frac{1}{n!} \sum_{\pi} (\sum_{i=1}^n |x_i a_{i,\pi(i)} |^2)^{1/2} is equivalent to a Musielak-Orlicz norm \norm{x}_{\sum M_i}. We also obtain the inverse result, i.e., given the Orlicz functions, we provide a formula for the choice of the matrix that generates the corresponding Musielak-Orlicz norm. As a consequence, we obtain the embedding of 2-concave Musielak-Orlicz spaces into L_1.
