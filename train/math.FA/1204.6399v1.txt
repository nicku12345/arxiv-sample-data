In this paper we obtain some slight correction and generalization of the results of Ryabtseva on the generalized resolvents for isometric operators with a gap in their spectrum. Also, analogs of some McKelvey's results and a short proof of Inin's formula for the generalized resolvents of an isometric operator are obtained.
