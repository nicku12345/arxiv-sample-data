Using the extrapolation of one-sided weights, we establish the boundedness of commutators generated by weighted Lipschitz functions and one-sided singular integral operators from weighted Lebesgue spaces to weighted one-sided Triebel-Lizorkin spaces. The corresponding results for commutators of one-sided discrete square functions are also obtained.
