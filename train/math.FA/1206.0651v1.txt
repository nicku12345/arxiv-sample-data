We present a reflexive Banach space with an unconditional basis which is quasi-minimal and tight by range, i.e. of type (4) in Ferenczi-Rosendal list within the framework of Gowers' classification program of Banach spaces. The space is an unconditional variant of the Gowers Hereditarily Indecomposable space with asymptotically unconditional basis.
