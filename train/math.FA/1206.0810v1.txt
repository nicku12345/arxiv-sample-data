We study the homogeneous equation (*)  u' = \Delta u, t > 0, u(0)=f\in wX, where wX is a weighted Banach space, w(x)= (1+||x||)^k, x\in \r^n with k\ge 0,  \Delta is the Laplacian, Y a complex Banach space and X one of the spaces  BUC (\r^n,Y)\} ,  C_0 (\r^n,Y),  L^p (\r^n,Y), 1 \le p < \infty. It is shown that the mild solutions of (*) are still given by the classical Gauss-Poisson formula, a holomorphic C_0-semigroup.
