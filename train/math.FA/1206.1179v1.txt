We give estimates for the approximation numbers of composition operators on H^2, in terms of some modulus of continuity. For symbols whose image is contained in a polygon, we get that these approximation numbers are dominated by \e^{- c \sqrt n}. When the symbol is continuous on the closed unit disk and has a domain touching the boundary non-tangentially at a finite number of points, with a good behavior at the boundary around those points, we can improve this upper estimate. A lower estimate is given when this symbol has a good radial behavior at some point. As an application we get that, for the cusp map, the approximation numbers are equivalent, up to constants, to \e^{- c \, n / \log n}, very near to the minimal value \e^{- c \, n}. We also see the limitations of our methods. To finish, we improve a result of O. El-Fallah, K. Kellay, M. Shabankhah and H. Youssfi, in showing that for every compact set K of the unit circle \T with Lebesgue measure 0, there exists a compact composition operator C_\phi \colon H^2 \to H^2, which is in all Schatten classes, and such that \phi = 1 on K and |\phi | < 1 outside K.
