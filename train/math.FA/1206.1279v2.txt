We present a reflexive Banach space \mathfrak{X}_{_{^\text{usm}}} which is Hereditarily Indecomposable and satisfies the following properties. In every subspace Y of \mathfrak{X}_{_{^\text{usm}}} there exists a weakly null normalized sequence \{y_n\}_n, such that every subsymmetric sequence \{z_n\}_n is isomorphically generated as a spreading model of a subsequence of \{y_n\}_n. Also, in every block subspace Y of \mathfrak{X}_{_{^\text{usm}}} there exists a seminormalized block sequence \{z_n\} and T:\mathfrak{X}_{_{^\text{usm}}}\rightarrow\mathfrak{X}_{_{^\text{usm}}} an isomorphism such that for every n\in\mathbb{N} T(z_{2n-1}) = z_{2n}. Thus the space is an example of an HI space which is not tight by range in a strong sense.
