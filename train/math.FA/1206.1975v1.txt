An n-by-n (n\ge 3) weighted shift matrix A is one of the form [{array}{cccc}0 & a_1 & & & 0 & \ddots & & & \ddots & a_{n-1} a_n & & & 0{array}], where the a_j's, called the weights of A, are complex numbers. Assume that all a_j's are nonzero and B is an n-by-n weighted shift matrix with weights b_1,..., b_n. We show that B is unitarily equivalent to A if and only if b_1... b_n=a_1...a_n and, for some fixed k, 1\le k \le n, |b_j| = |a_{k+j}| (a_{n+j}\equiv a_j) for all j. Next, we show that A is reducible if and only if A has periodic weights, that is, for some fixed k, 1\le k \le \lfloor n/2\rfloor, n is divisible by k, and |a_j|=|a_{k+j}| for all 1\le j\le n-k. Finally, we prove that A and B have the same numerical range if and only if a_1...a_n=b_1...b_n and S_r(|a_1|^2,..., |a_n|^2)=S_r(|b_1|^2,..., |b_n|^2) for all 1\le r\le \lfloor n/2\rfloor, where S_r's are the circularly symmetric functions.
