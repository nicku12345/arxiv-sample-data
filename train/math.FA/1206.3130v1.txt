For 1< p <2 we obtain sharp inequalities for the supremum of products of homogeneous polynomials on L_p(\mu), whenever the number of factors is no greater than the dimension of these Banach spaces (a condition readily satisfied in the infinite dimensional settings). The results also holds for the Schatten classes \mathcal S_p. For p>2 we present some estimates on the involved constants.
