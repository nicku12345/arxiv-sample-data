Let C be a convex subset of a locally convex space. We provide optimal approximate fixed point results for sequentially continuous maps f\colon C\to\bar{C}. First we prove that if f(C) is totally bounded, then it has an approximate fixed point net. Next, it is shown that if C is bounded but not totally bounded, then there is a uniformly continuous map f\colon C\to C without approximate fixed point nets. We also exhibit an example of a sequentially continuous map defined on a compact convex set with no approximate fixed point sequence. In contrast, it is observed that every affine (not-necessarily continuous) self-mapping a bounded convex subset of a topological vector space has an approximate fixed point sequence. Moreover, it is constructed a affine sequentially continuous map from a compact convex set into itself without fixed points.
