Given a finite sequence of vectors \mathcal F_0 in \C^d we describe the spectral and geometrical structure of optimal completions of \mathcal F_0 obtained by adding a finite sequence of vectors with prescribed norms, where optimality is measured with respect to a general convex potential. In particular, our analysis includes the so-called Mean Square Error (MSE) and the Benedetto-Fickus' frame potential. On a first step, we reduce the problem of finding the optimal completions to the computation of the minimum of a convex function in a convex compact polytope in \R^d. As a second step, we show that there exists a finite set (that can be explicitly computed in terms of a finite step algorithm that depends on \cF_0 and the sequence of prescribed norms) such that the optimal frame completions with respect to a given convex potential can be described in terms of a distinguished element of this set. As a byproduct we characterize the cases of equality in Lindskii's inequality from matrix theory.
