We consider the Hodge Laplacian \Delta on the Heisenberg group H_n, endowed with a left-invariant and U(n)-invariant Riemannian metric. For 0\le k\le 2n+1, let \Delta_k denote the Hodge Laplacian restricted to k-forms.   Our first main result shows that L^2\Lambda^k(H_n) decomposes into finitely many mutually orthogonal subspaces \V_\nu with the properties: {itemize} \dom \Delta_k splits along the \V_\nu's as \sum_\nu(\dom\Delta_k\cap \V_\nu); \Delta_k:(\dom\Delta_k\cap \V_\nu)\longrightarrow \V_\nu for every \nu; for each \nu, there is a Hilbert space \cH_\nu of L^2-sections of a U(n)-homogeneous vector bundle over H_n such that the restriction of \Delta_k to \V_\nu is unitarily equivalent to an explicit scalar operator. {itemize}   Next, we consider L^p\Lambda^k, 1<p<\infty, and prove that the same kind of decomposition holds true. More precisely we show that: {itemize} the Riesz transforms d\Delta_k^{-\half} are L^p-bounded; the orthogonal projection onto \cV_\nu extends from (L^2\cap L^p)\Lambda^k to a bounded operator from L^p\Lambda^k to the the L^p-closure \cV_
