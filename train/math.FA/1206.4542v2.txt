This paper presents a bicomplex version of the Spectral Decomposition Theorem on infinite dimensional bicomplex Hilbert spaces. In the process, the ideas of bounded linear operators, orthogonal complements and compact operators on bicomplex Hilbert spaces are introduced and treated in relation with the classical Hilbert space M' imbedded in any bicomplex Hilbert space M.
