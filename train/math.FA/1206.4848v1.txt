Let (A_0, A_1) be an interpolation couple, and let B_j be the closure of A_0^\ast \cap A_1^\ast in A_j^\ast, j = 0, 1. For every \theta \in \, ]0, 1[, there exists a natural one to one contraction R^\theta : A^\theta \rightarrow (B_0^\ast, B_1^\ast)^\theta. For some \beta \in \, ]0, 1[, the closure of R^\beta (A^\beta) in (B_0^\ast, B_1^\ast)^\beta is supposed to be weakly LUR. Then A^\theta = A_\theta for every \theta \in \, ]0, 1[.
