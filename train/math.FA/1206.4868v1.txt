Let q(x) and p(x) denote density functions on the n-dimensional Euclidean space, and let p_i(\cdot|y_1,..., y_{i-1},y_{i+1},..., y_n) and Q_i(\cdot|x_1,..., x_{i-1},x_{i+1},..., x_n) denote their local specifications. For a class of density functions q we prove an inequality between the relative entropy D(p||q) and a weighted sum of the conditional relative entropies D(p_i(\cdot|Y_1,..., Y_{i-1},Y_{i+1},..., Y_n) ||Q_i(\cdot|Y_1,..., Y_{i-1},Y_{i+1},..., Y_n)) that holds for any p. The weights are proportional to the logarithmic Sobolev constants of the local specifications of q. Thereby we derive a logarithmic Sobolev inequality for a weighted Gibbs sampler governed by the local specifications of q. Moreover, this inequality implies a classical logarithmic Sobolev inequality for q, as defined for Gaussian distribution by L. Gross. This strengthens a result by F. Otto and M. Reznikoff. The proof is based on ideas developed by F. Otto and C. Villani in their paper on the connection between Talagrand's transportation-cost inequality and logarithmic Sobolev inequality.
