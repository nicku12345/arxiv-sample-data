In this paper we study various types of spectra of functions \phi:\jj\to X, where \jj\in\{\r_+,\r\} and X is a complex Banach space. We show that uniform spectrum defined in [15] coincides with Carleman spectrum for \phi\in L^{\infty}(\r,X). This result holds true also for Laplace (half-line) spectrum for \phi\in L^{\infty}(\r_+,X). We also indicate a class of bounded measurable functions for which Laplace spectrum and Carleman spectrum are equal
