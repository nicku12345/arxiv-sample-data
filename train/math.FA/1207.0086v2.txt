We give a characterization of commutative semispectral measures by means of Feller and Strong Feller Markov kernels. In particular:   {itemize} we show that a semispectral measure F is commutative if and only if there exist a self-adjoint operator A and a Markov kernel \mu_{(\cdot)}(\cdot):\Gamma\times\mathcal{B}(\mathbb{R})\to[0,1], \Gamma\subset\sigma(A), E(\Gamma)=\mathbf{1}, such that F(\Delta)=\int_{\Gamma}\mu_{\Delta}(\lambda)\,dE_{\lambda}, \noindent and \mu_{(\Delta)} is continuous for each \Delta\in R where, R\subset\mathcal{B}(\mathbb{R}) is a ring which generates the Borel \sigma-algebra of the reals \mathcal{B}(\mathbb{R}). Moreover, \mu_{(\cdot)}(\cdot) is a Feller Markov kernel and separates the points of \Gamma. we prove that F admits a strong Feller Markov kernel \mu_{(\cdot)}(\cdot), if and only if F is uniformly continuous. Finally, we prove that if F is absolutely continuous with respect to a regular finite measure \nu then, it admits a strong Feller Markov kernel. {itemize} The mathematical and physical relevance of the results is discussed giving a particular emphasis to the connections between \mu and the imprecision of the measurement apparatus.
