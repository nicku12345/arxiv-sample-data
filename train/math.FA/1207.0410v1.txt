In this paper we study (continuous) polynomials p: J\to X, where J is an abelian topological semigroup and X is a topological vector space. If J is a subsemigroup with non-empty interior of a locally compact abelian group G and G=J-J, then every polynomial p on J extends uniquely to a polynomial on  G. It is of particular interest to know when the spaces P^n (J,X) of polynomials of order at most n are finite dimensional. For example we show that for some semigroups the subspace P^n_{R} (J,\mathbf{C}) of Riss polynomials (those generated by a finite number of homomorphisms \alpha: J\to \mathbf{R}) is properly contained in P^n (G,\mathbf{C}). However, if P^1 (J,\mathbf{C}) is finite dimensional then P^n_{R} (J,\mathbf{C})= P^n (J,\mathbf{C}). Finally we exhibit a large family of groups for which P^n (G,\mathbf{C}) is finite dimensional.
