Suppose \mathcal{H} is a weighted Hardy space of analytic functions on the unit ball \mathbb{B}_n\subset\mathbb{C}^n such that the composition operator C_\psi defined by C_{\psi}f=f\circ\psi is bounded on \mathcal{H} whenever \psi is a linear fractional self-map of \mathbb{B}_n. If \varphi is an involutive Moebius automorphism of \mathbb{B}_n, we find a conjugation operator \mathcal{J} on \mathcal{H} such that C_{\varphi}=\mathcal{J} C^*_{\varphi}\mathcal{J}. The case n=1 answers a question of Garcia and Hammond.
