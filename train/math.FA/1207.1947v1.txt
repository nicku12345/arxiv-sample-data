For an operator ideal \mathcal A, we study the composition operator ideals {\mathcal A}\circ{\mathcal K}, {\mathcal K}\circ{\mathcal A} and {\mathcal K}\circ{\mathcal A}\circ{\mathcal K}, where \mathcal K is the ideal of compact operators. We introduce a notion of an \mathcal A-approximation property on a Banach space and characterise it in terms of the density of finite rank operators in {\mathcal A}\circ{\mathcal K} and {\mathcal K}\circ{\mathcal A}.   We propose the notions of \ell_{\infty}-extension and \ell_{1}-lifting properties for an operator ideal \mathcal A and study {\mathcal A}\circ{\mathcal K}, {\mathcal}\circ{\mathcal A} and the \mathcal A-approximation property where \mathcal A is injective or surjective and/or with the \ell_{\infty}-extension or \ell_{1}-lifting property. In particular, we show that if \mathcal A is an injective operator ideal with the \ell_\infty-extension property, then we have: (a) X has the \mathcal A-approximation property if and only if ({\mathcal A}^{min})^{inj}(Y,X)={\mathcal A}^{min}(Y,X), for all Banach spaces Y. (b) The dual space X^* has the \mathcal A-approximation property if and only if (({\mathcal A}^{dual})^{min})^{sur}(X,Y)=({\mathcal A}^{dual})^{min}(X,Y), for all Banach spaces Y.}For an operator ideal \mathcal A, we study the composition operator ideals {\mathcal A}\circ{\mathcal K},
