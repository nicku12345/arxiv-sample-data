The curvature \mathcal K_T(w) of a contraction T in the Cowen-Douglas class B_1(\mathbb D) is bounded above by the curvature \mathcal K_{S^*}(w) of the backward shift operator. However, in general, an operator satisfying the curvature inequality need not be contractive. In this note, we characterize a slightly smaller class of contractions using a stronger form of the curvature inequality. Along the way, we find conditions on the metric of the holomorphic Hermitian vector bundle E_T corresponding to the operator T in the Cowen-Douglas class B_1(\mathbb D) which ensures negative definiteness of the curvature function. We obtain a generalization for commuting tuples of operators in the class B_1(\Omega), for a bounded domain \Omega in \mathbb C^m.
