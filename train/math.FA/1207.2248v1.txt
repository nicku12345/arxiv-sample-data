Each bounded holomorphic function on the infinite dimensional polydisk \mathbb{D}^\infty, f \in H_\infty(\mathbb{D}^\infty), defines a formal monomial series expansion that in general does not converge to f. The set \mon H_\infty(\mathbb{D}^\infty) contains all  z 's in which the monomial series expansion of each function f \in H_\infty(\mathbb{D}^\infty) sums up to f(z). Bohr, Bohnenblust and Hille, showed that it contains \ell_{2} \cap \mathbb{D}^\infty, but does not contain any of the slices \ell_{2+\varepsilon} \cap \mathbb{D}^\infty. This was done in the context of Dirichlet series and our article is very much inspired by recent deep developments in this direction. Our main contribution shows that z \in \mon H_\infty(\mathbb{D}^\infty) whenever \bar{\lim} \big(\frac{1}{\log n} \sum_{j=1}^{n} z^{* 2}_{j} \big)^{1/2} < 1/\sqrt{2}, and conversely \bar{\lim} \big(\frac{1}{\log n} \sum_{j=1}^{n} z^{* 2}_{j} \big)^{1/2} \leq 1 for each z \in \mon H_\infty(\mathbb{D}^\infty). The Banach space H_\infty(\mathbb{D}^\infty) can be identified with the Hardy space H_\infty(\mathbb{T}^\infty); this motivates a study of sets of monomial convergence of H_p-functions on \mathbb{T}^\infty (consisting of all z's in \mathbb{D}^{\infty} for which the series \sum \hat{f}(\alpha) z^{\alpha} converges). We show that \mon H_\infty(\mathbb{T}^\infty) = \mon H_\infty(\mathbb{D}^\infty) and \mon H_{p}(\mathbb{T}^\infty) = \ell_{2} \cap \mathbb{D}^\infty for 1 \leq p < \infty and give a representation of H_{p}(\mathbb{T}^\infty) in terms of holomorphic functions on \mathbb{D}^{\infty}. This links our circle of ideas with well-known results due to Cole and Gamelin.
