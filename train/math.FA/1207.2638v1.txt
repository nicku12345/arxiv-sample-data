A densely defined composition operator in an L^2-space induced by a measurable transformation \phi is shown to be quasinormal if and only if the Radon-Nikodym derivatives h_{\phi^n} attached to powers \phi^n of \phi have the multiplicative property: h_{\phi^n} = h_{\phi}^n almost everywhere for n = 0, 1, 2, ....
