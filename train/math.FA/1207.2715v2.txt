Let \alpha\in (0,2), let {\cal E}(u,u)=\int_{\Bbb R^d}\int_{\Bbb R^d} (u(y)-u(x))^2\frac{A(x,y)}{|x-y|^{d+\alpha}}\, dy\, dx be the Dirichlet form for a stable-like operator, let \Gamma u(x)=\int_{\Bbb R^d} (u(y)-u(x))^2\frac{A(x,y)}{|x-y|^{d+\alpha}}\, dy, let L be the associated infinitesimal generator, and suppose A(x,y) is jointly measurable, symmetric, bounded, and bounded below by a positive constant. We prove that if u is the weak solution to Lu=h, then \Gamma u\in L^p for some p>2. This is the analogue of an inequality of Meyers for solutions to divergence form elliptic equations. As an application, we prove strong stability results for stable-like operators. If A is perturbed slightly, we give explicit bounds on how much the semigroup and fundamental solution are perturbed.
