We study the relations between some geometric properties of maximal monotone operators and generic geometric and analytical properties of the functions on the associate Fitzpatrick family of convex representations. We also investigate under which conditions a convex function represents a maximal monotone operator with bounded range and provide an example of a non type (D) operator on this class.
