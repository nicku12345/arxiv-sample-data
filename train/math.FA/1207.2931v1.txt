Let S be a subspace of L^2 (\bm{R}). We show that the operator M of multiplication by the independent variable has a simple symmetric regular restriction to S with deficiency indices (1,1) if and only if S = u h K^{2}_\theta is a nearly invariant subspace, with \theta a meromorphic inner function vanishing at i. Here u is unimodular, h is an isometric multiplier of K^{2}_\theta into H^2 and H^2 is the Hardy space of the upper half plane. Our proof uses the dilation theory of completely positive maps.
