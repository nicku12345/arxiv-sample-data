The local boundedness of classes of operators is analyzed on different subsets directly related to their Fitzpatrick functions and characterizations of the topological vector spaces for which that local boundedness holds is given in terms of the uniform boundedness principle. For example the local boundedness of a maximal monotone operator on the algebraic interior of its domain convex hull is a characteristic of barreled locally convex spaces.
