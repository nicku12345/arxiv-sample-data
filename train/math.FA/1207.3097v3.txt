We provide a partial answer to the question of Vladimir Kadets whether given an \mathcal F-basis of a Banach space X, with respect to some filter \mathcal F\subset \mathcal P(\mathbb N), the coordinate functionals are continuous. The answer is positive if the character of \mathcal F is less than \mathfrak{p}. In this case every \mathcal F-basis with individual brackets is an M-basis with brackets determined by a set from \mathcal F.
