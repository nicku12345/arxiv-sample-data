Let 1 \leq p <\infty. A sequence \lef x_n \rig in a Banach space X is defined to be p-operator summable if for each \lef f_n \rig \in l^{w^*}_p(X^*), we have \lef \lef f_n(x_k)\rig_k \rig_n \in l^s_p(l_p). Every norm p-summable sequence in a Banach space is operator p-summable, while in its turn every operator p-summable sequence is weakly p-summable. An operator T \in B(X, Y) is said to be p-limited if for every \lef x_n \rig \in l_p^w(X), \lef Tx_n \rig is operator p-summable. The set of all p-limited operators form a normed operator ideal. It is shown that every weakly p-summable sequence in X is operator p-summable if and only if every operator T \in B(X, l_p) is p-absolutely summing. On the other hand every operator p-summable sequence in X is norm p-summable if and only if every p-limited operator in B(l_{p'}, X) is absolutely p-summing. Moreover, this is the case if and only if X is a subspace of L_p(\mu) for some Borel measure \mu.
