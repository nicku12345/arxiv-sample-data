We prove that if continuum is not a Kunen cardinal, then there is a uniform Eberlein compact space K such that the Banach space C(K) does not embed isometrically into \ell_\infty/c_0. We prove a similar result for isomorphic embeddings. We also construct a consistent example of a uniform Eberlein compactum whose space of continuous functions embeds isomorphically into \ell_\infty/c_0, but fails to embed isometrically. As far as we know it is the first example of this kind.
