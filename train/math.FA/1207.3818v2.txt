We say that a real-valued function f defined on a positive Borel measure space (X,\mu) is nowhere q-integrable if, for each nonvoid open subset U of X, the restriction f|_U is not in L^q(U). When (X,\mu) satisfies some natural properties, we show that certain sets of functions defined in X which are p-integrable for some p's but nowhere q-integrable for some other q's (0<p,q<\infty) admit a variety of large linear and algebraic structures within them. The presented results answer a question from Bernal-Gonz\'alez, improve and complement recent spaceability and algebrability results from several authors and motivates new research directions in the field of spaceability.
