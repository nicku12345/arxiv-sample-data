We give an almost complete description of the coarse and uniform embeddability between Orlicz sequence spaces. We show that the embeddability between two Orlicz sequence spaces is in most cases determined only by the values of their upper Matuszewska-Orlicz indices. On the other hand, we present examples which show that sometimes the embeddability is not determined by the values of these indices.
