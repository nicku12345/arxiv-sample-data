We give an expression for the norm of the space constructed by Tsirelson. The implicit equation satisfied by this norm is dual to the implicit equation for the norm of the dual of Tsirelson space given by Figiel and Johnson. The expression can be modified to give the norm of the dual of any mixed Tsirelson space. In particular, our results can be adapted to give the norm for the dual of Schlumprecht space.
