Given a strictly increasing sequence \Lambda=(\lambda_n) of nonegative real numbers, with \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{\lambda_n}<\infty, the M\"untz spaces M_\Lambda^p are defined as the closure in L^p([0,1]) of the monomials x^{\lambda_n}. We discuss how properties of the embedding M_\Lambda^2\subset L^2(\mu), where \mu is a finite positive Borel measure on the interval [0,1], have immediate consequences for composition operators on M^2_\Lambda. We give criteria for composition operators to be bounded, compact, or to belong to the Schatten--von Neumann ideals.
