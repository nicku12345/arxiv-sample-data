The paper deals with totally geodesic Radon transforms on constant curvature spaces. We study applicability of the historically the first Funk-Radon-Helgason method of mean value operators to reconstruction of continuous and L^p functions from their Radon transforms. New inversion formulas involving Erd\'elyi-Kober type fractional integrals are obtained. Particular emphasis is placed on the choice of the differentiation operator in the spirit of the recent Helgason's formula.
