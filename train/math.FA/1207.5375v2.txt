Given a Banach space X, for n\in \mathbb N and p\in (1,\infty) we investigate the smallest constant \mathfrak P\in (0,\infty) for which every f_1,...,f_n:{-1,1}^n\to X satisfy \int_{{-1,1}^n}\Bigg|\sum_{j=1}^n \partial_jf_j(\varepsilon)\Bigg|^pd\mu(\varepsilon) \leq \mathfrak{P}^p\int_{{-1,1}^n}\int_{{-1,1}^n}\Bigg\|\sum_{j=1}^n \d_j\Delta f_j(\varepsilon)\Bigg\|^pd\mu(\varepsilon) d\mu(\delta), where \mu is the uniform probability measure on the discrete hypercube {-1,1}^n and {\partial_j}_{j=1}^n and \Delta=\sum_{j=1}^n\partial_j are the hypercube partial derivatives and the hypercube Laplacian, respectively. Denoting this constant by \mathfrak{P}_p^n(X), we show that \mathfrak{P}_p^n(X)\le \sum_{k=1}^{n}\frac{1}{k} for every Banach space (X,|\cdot|). This extends the classical Pisier inequality, which corresponds to the special case f_j=\Delta^{-1}\partial_j f for some f:{-1,1}^n\to X. We show that \sup_{n\in \N}\mathfrak{P}_p^n(X)<\infty if either the dual X^* is a \mathrm{UMD}^+ Banach space, or for some \theta\in (0,1) we have X=[H,Y]_\theta, where H is a Hilbert space and Y is an arbitrary Banach space. It follows that \sup_{n\in \N}\mathfrak{P}_p^n(X)<\infty if X is a Banach lattice of finite cotype.
