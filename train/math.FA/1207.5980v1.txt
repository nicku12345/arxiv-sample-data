We study weighted composition operators on Hilbert spaces of analytic functions on the unit ball with kernels of the form (1-<z,w>)^{-\gamma} for \gamma>0. We find necessary and sufficient conditions for the adjoint of a weighted composition operator to be a weighted composition operator or the inverse of a weighted composition operator. We then obtain characterizations of self-adjoint and unitary weighted composition operators. Normality of these operators is also investigated.
