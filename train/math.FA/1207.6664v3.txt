Considering the successful theory of multiple summing multilinear operators as a prototype, we introduce the classes of multiple Cohen strongly p-summing multilinear operators and polynomials. The adequacy of these classes under the viewpoint of the theory of multilinear and polynomial ideals and holomorphy types is discussed in detail. Some abstract results are also proved in the abstract setting of the full general Pietsch Domination Theorem due to Pellegrino, Santos and Seoane-Sep\'{u}lveda.
