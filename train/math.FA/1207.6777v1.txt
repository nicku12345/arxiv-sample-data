In this paper we establish some new results concerning the Cauchy-Peano problem in Banach spaces. Firstly, we prove that if a Banach space E admits a fundamental biorthogonal system, then there exists a continuous vector field f\colon E\to E such that the autonomous differential equation u'=f(u) has no solutions at any time. The proof relies on a key result asserting that every infinite-dimensional Fr\'echet space with a fundamental biorthogonal system possesses a nontrivial separable quotient. The later, is the byproduct of a mixture of known results on barrelledness and two fundamental results of Banach space theory (namely, a result of Pe{\l}czy\'nski on Banach spaces containing L_1(\mu) and the \ell_1-theorem of Rosenthal). Next, we introduce a natural notion of weak-approximate solutions for the non-autonomous Cauchy-Peano problem in Banach spaces, and prove that a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of such an approximation is the absence of \ell_1-isomorphs inside the underline space. We also study a kind of algebraic genericity for the Cauchy-Peano problem in spaces E having complemented subspaces with unconditional Schauder basis. It is proved that if \mathscr{K}(E) denotes the family of all continuous vector fields f\colon E\to E for which u'=f(u) has no solutions at any time, then \mathscr{K}(E)\bigcup \{0\} is spaceable in sense that it contains a closed infinite dimensional subspace of C(E), the locally convex space of all continuous vector fields on E with the linear topology of uniform convergence on bounded sets.
