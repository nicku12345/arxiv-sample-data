We present several sharp inequalities for the SL(n) invariant \Omega_{2,n}(K) introduced in our earlier work on centro-affine invariants for smooth convex bodies containing the origin. A connection arose with the Paouris-Werner invariant \Omega_K defined for convex bodies K whose centroid is at the origin. We offer two alternative definitions for \Omega_K when K \in C^2_+. The technique employed prompts us to conjecture that any SL(n) invariant of convex bodies with continuous and positive centro-affine curvature function can be obtained as a limit of normalized p-affine surface areas of the convex body.
