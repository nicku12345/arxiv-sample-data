We use KKM theorem to prove the existence of a new fixed point theorem for non-expansive mapping:Let M be a bounded closed convex subset of Hilbert space H, and A:M\rightarrow M be a non-expansive mapping, then exists a fixed point of A in M, we also apply this Theorem to study the solution for an integral equation,we can weak some conditions comparing with Banach's contraction principe.
