Let A be a densely defined simple symmetric operator in \gH, let \Pi=\bt be a boundary triplet for A^* and let M(\cd) be the corresponding Weyl function. It is known that the Weyl function M(\cd) determines the boundary triplet \Pi, in particular, the pair {A,A_0}, where A_0:= A^*\lceil\ker\G_0 (= A^*_0), uniquely up to unitary similarity. At the same time the Weyl function corresponding to a boundary triplet for a dual pair of operators defines it uniquely only up to weak similarity.   In this paper we consider symmetric dual pairs {A,A} generated by A\subset A^* and special boundary triplets \wt\Pi for {A,A}. We are interested whether the result on unitary similarity remains valid provided that the Weyl function corresponding to \wt\Pi is \wt M(z)= K^*(B-M(z))^{-1} K, where B is some non-self-adjoint bounded operator in \cH. We specify some conditions in terms of the operators A_0 and A_B= A^*\lceil \ker(\G_1-B\G_0), which determine uniquely (up to unitary equivalence) the pair {A,A_B} by the Weyl function \wt M(\cd). Moreover, it is shown that under some additional assumptions the Weyl function M_\Pi(\cdot) of the boundary triplet \Pi for the dual pair \DA determines the triplet \Pi uniquely up to unitary similarity. We obtain also some negative results demonstrating that in general the Weyl function \wt M(\cd) does not determine the operator A_B even up to similarity.
