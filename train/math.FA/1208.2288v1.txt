For every multivariable polynomial p, with p(0)=1, we construct a determinantal representation p=\det (I - K Z), where Z is a diagonal matrix with coordinate variables on the diagonal and K is a complex square matrix. Such a representation is equivalent to the existence of K whose principal minors satisfy certain linear relations. When norm constraints on K are imposed, we give connections to the multivariable von Neumann inequality, Agler denominators, and stability. We show that if a multivariable polynomial q, q(0)=0, satisfies the von Neumann inequality, then 1-q admits a determinantal representation with K a contraction. On the other hand, every determinantal representation with a contractive K gives rise to a rational inner function in the Schur--Agler class.
