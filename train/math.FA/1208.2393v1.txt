We introduce and investigate in this short article a new characteristic of rearrangement invariant (r.i.) (symmetric) space, namely so-called Tchebychev's characteristic. We reveal an important class of the r.i. spaces - so called regular r. i. spaces and show that the majority of known r.i. spaces: Lebesgue-Riesz, Grand Lebesgue Spaces, Orlicz, Lorentz and Marcinkiewicz r.i. spaces are regular. But we construct after several examples of r.i. spaces without the regular property.
