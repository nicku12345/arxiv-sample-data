Let K be a positive compact operator on a Banach lattice. We prove that if either [K> or <K] is ideal irreducible then [K>=<K]=L_+(X)\cap {K}'. We also establish the Perron-Frobenius Theorem for such operators K. Finally we apply the results to answer questions in Abramovich and Aliprantis (2002) and Bra\v{c}i\v{c} (2010).
