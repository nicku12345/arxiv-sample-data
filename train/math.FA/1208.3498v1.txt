The classical Perron-Frobenius theory asserts that an irreducible matrix A has cyclic peripheral spectrum and its spectral radius r(A) is an eigenvalue corresponding to a positive eigenvector. In Radjavi (1999) and Radjavi and Rosenthal (2000), this was extended to semigroups of matrices and of compact operators on L_p-spaces. We extend this approach to operators on an arbitrary Banach lattice X. We prove, in particular, that if \iS is a commutative irreducible semigroup of positive operators on X containing a compact operator T then there exist positive disjoint vectors x_1,...,x_r in X such that every operator in \iS acts as a positive scalar multiple of a permutation on x_1,...,x_r. Compactness of T may be replaced with the assumption that T is peripherally Riesz, i.e., the peripheral spectrum of T is separated from the rest of the spectrum and the corresponding spectral subspace X_1 is finite dimensional. Applying the results to the semigroup generated an irreducible peripherally Riesz operator T, we show that T is a cyclic permutation on x_1,...,x_r, X_1=\Span{x_1,...,x_r}, and if S=\lim_j b_jT^{n_j} for some (b_j) in \mathbb R_+ and n_j\to\infty then S=c(T_{|X_1})^k\oplus 0 for some c\ge 0 and 0\le k<r. We also extend results of Abramovich et al. (1992) and Grobler (1995) about peripheral spectra of irreducible operators.
