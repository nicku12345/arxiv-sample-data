Let \Rx denote the ring of polynomials in g freely non-commuting variables x=(x_1,...,x_g). There is a natural involution * on \Rx determined by x_j^*=x_j and (pq)^*=q^* p^* and a free polynomial p\in\Rx is symmetric if it is invariant under this involution. If X=(X_1,...,X_g) is a g tuple of symmetric n\times n matrices, then the evaluation p(X) is naturally defined and further p^*(X)=p(X)^*. In particular, if p is symmetric, then p(X)^*=p(X). The main result of this article says if p is symmetric, p(0)=0 and for each n and each symmetric positive definite n\times n matrix A the set {X:A-p(X)\succ 0} is convex, then p has degree at most two and is itself convex, or -p is a hermitian sum of squares.
