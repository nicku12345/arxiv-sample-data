By giving up the best constants, we will see that the original argument of Spielman and Srivastava for proving the Bourgain-Tzafriri Restricted Invertibility Theorem \cite{SS} still works - and is much simplier than the final version. We do not intend on publishing this since it is their argument with just a trivial modification, but we want to make it available to the mathematics community since several people have requested it already.
