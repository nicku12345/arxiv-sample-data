We introduce and study procedures and constructions in the theory of the joint spectral radius that are related to the spectral theory. In particular we devlop the theory of the scattered radical. Among applications we find some sufficient conditions of continuity of the spectrum and spectral radii of various types, and prove that in GCR C*-algebras the joint spectral radius is continuous on precompact subsets and coincides with the Berger-Wang radius.
