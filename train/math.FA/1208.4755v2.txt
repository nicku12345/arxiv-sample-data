A Banach space X is said to have the \mathsf{SVM} (stability of vector measures) property if there exists a constant v<\infty such that for any algebra of sets \mathcal F, and any function \nu\colon\mathcal F\to X satisfying \|\nu(A\cup B)-\nu(A)-\nu(B)\|\leq 1\quad{for disjoint}A,B\in\mathcal F,there is a vector measure \mu\colon\mathcal F\to X with \|\nu(A)-\mu(A)\|\leq v for all A\in\mathcal F. If this condition is valid when restricted to set algebras \mathcal F of cardinality less than some fixed cardinal number \kappa, then we say that X has the \kappa-\mathsf{SVM} property. The least cardinal \kappa for which X does not have the \kappa-\mathsf{SVM} property (if it exists) is called the \mathsf{SVM} character of X. We apply the machinery of twisted sums and quasi-linear maps to characterise these properties and to determine \mathsf{SVM} characters for many classical Banach spaces. We also discuss connections between the \kappa-\mathsf{SVM} property, \kappa-injectivity and the `three-space' problem.
