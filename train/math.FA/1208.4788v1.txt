We study the boundedness of some sublinear operators on weighted Morrey spaces under certain size conditions. These conditions are satisfied by most of the operators in harmonic analysis, such as the Hardy-Littlewood maximal operator, Calder\'{o}n-Zygmund singular integral operator, Bochner-Riesz means at the critical index, oscillatory singular operators, singular integral operators with oscillating kernels and so on. As applications, the regularity in weighted Morrey spaces of strong solutions to nondivergence elliptic equations with VMO coefficients are established.
