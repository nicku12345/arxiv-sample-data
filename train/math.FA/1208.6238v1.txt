Recently, in paper published in the Annals of Mathematics, it was shown that the Bohnenblust-Hille inequality for (complex) homogeneous polynomials is hypercontractive. However, and to the best of our knowledge, there is no result providing (nontrivial) lower bounds for the optimal constants for n-homogeneous polynomials (n > 2). In this short note we provide lower bounds for these famous constants.
