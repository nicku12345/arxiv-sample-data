In this paper, weighted norm inequalities with A_p weights are established for the multilinear singular integral operators whose kernels satisfy L^{r'}-H\"ormander regularity condition. As applications, we recover a weighted estimate for the multilinear Fourier multiplier obtained by Fujita and Tomita, and obtain several new weighted estimates for the multilinear Fourier multiplier as well.
