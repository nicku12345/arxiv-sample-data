Let \mu be a probability measure on a separable Banach space X. A subset U\subset X is \mu-continuous if \mu(\partial U)=0. In the paper the \mu-continuity and uniform \mu-continuity of convex bodies in X, especially of balls and half-spaces, is considered. The \mu-continuity is interesting for study of the Glivenko-Cantelli theorem in Banach spaces. Answer to a question of F. Tops{\o}e is given.
