We introduce the (T)-property, and prove that every Banach space with the (T)-property has the Mazur-Ulam property (briefly MUP). As its immediate applications, we obtain that almost-CL-spaces admitting a smooth point(specially, separable almost-CL-spaces) and a two-dimensional space whose unit sphere is a hexagon has the MUP. Furthermore, we discuss the stability of the spaces having the MUP by the c_0- and \ell_1-sums, and show that the space C(K,X) of the vector-valued continuous functions has the the MUP, where X is a separable almost-CL-space and K is a compact metric space.
