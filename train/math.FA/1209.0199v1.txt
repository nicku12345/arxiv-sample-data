We study the separable complementation property (SCP) and its natural variations in Banach spaces of continuous functions over compacta K_{\mathcal A} induced by almost disjoint families {\mathcal A} of countable subsets of uncountable sets. For these spaces, we prove among others that C(K_{\mathcal A}) has the controlled variant of the separable complementation property if and only if C(K_{\mathcal A}) is Lindel\"of in the weak topology if and only if K_{\mathcal A} is monolithic. We give an example of {\mathcal A} for which C(K_{\mathcal A}) has the SCP, while K_{\mathcal A} is not monolithic and an example of a space C(K_{\mathcal A}) with controlled and continuous SCP which has neither a projectional skeleton nor a projectional resolution of the identity. Finally, we describe the structure of almost disjoint families of cardinality \omega_1 which induce monolithic spaces of the form K_{\mathcal A}: They can be obtained from countably many ladder systems and pairwise disjoint families applying simple operations.
