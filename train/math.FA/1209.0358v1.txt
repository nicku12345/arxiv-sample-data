Let X be a space of homogeneous type and let L be an injective, non-negative, self-adjoint operator on L^2(X) such that the semigroup generated by -L fulfills Davies-Gaffney estimates of arbitrary order. We prove that the operator F(L), initially defined on H^1_L(X)\cap L^2(X), acts as a bounded linear operator on the Hardy space H^1_L(X) associated with L whenever F is a bounded, sufficiently smooth function. Based on this result, together with interpolation, we establish H\"ormander type spectral multiplier theorems on Lebesgue spaces for non-negative, self-adjoint operators satisfying generalized Gaussian estimates in which the required differentiability order is relaxed compared to all known spectral multiplier results.
