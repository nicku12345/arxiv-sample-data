We show results on L^p-spectral multipliers for Maxwell operators with bounded measurable coefficients. We also present similar results for the Stokes operator with Hodge boundary conditions and the Lam\'e system. Here we rely on resolvent estimates established recently by M.\ Mitrea and S.\ Monniaux.
