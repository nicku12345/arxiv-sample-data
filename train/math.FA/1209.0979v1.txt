We prove that a continuous linear operator T on a topological vector space X with weak topology is mixing if and only if the dual operator T' has no finite dimensional invariant subspaces. This result implies the characterization of hypercyclic operators on the space \omega due to Herzog and Lemmert and implies the result of Bayart and Matheron, who proved that for any hypercyclic operator T on \omega, T\oplus T is also hypercyclic.
