We treat the question of existence of common hypercyclic vectors for families of continuous linear operators. It is shown that for any continuous linear operator T on a complex Fr\'echet space X and a set \Lambda\subseteq \R_+\times\C which is not of zero three-dimensional Lebesgue measure, the family \{aT+bI:(a,b)\in\Lambda\} has no common hypercyclic vectors. This allows to answer negatively questions raised by Godefroy and Shapiro and by Aron. We also prove a sufficient condition for a family of scalar multiples of a given operator on a complex Fr\'echet space to have a common hypercyclic vector. It allows to show that if \D=\{z\in\C:|z|<1\} and \phi\in \H^\infty(\D) is non-constant, then the family \{zM_\phi^\star:b^{-1}<|z|<a^{-1}\} has a common hypercyclic vector, where M_\phi:\H^2(\D)\to \H^2(\D), M_\phi f=\phi f, a=\inf\{|\phi(z)|:z\in\D\} and b=\sup\{|\phi(z)|:|z|\in\D\}, providing an affirmative answer to a question by Bayart and Grivaux. Finally, extending a result of Costakis and Sambarino, we prove that the family \{aT_b:a,b\in\C\setminus\{0\}\} has a common hypercyclic vector, where T_bf(z)=f(z-b) acts on the Fr\'echet space \H(\C) of entire functions on one complex variable.
