A series S_a=\sum\limits_{n=-\infty}^\infty a_nz^n is called a {\it pointwise universal trigonometric series} if for any f\in C(\T), there exists a strictly increasing sequence \{n_k\}_{k\in\N} of positive integers such that \sum\limits_{j=-n_k}^{n_k} a_jz^j converges to f(z) pointwise on \T. We find growth conditions on coefficients allowing and forbidding the existence of a pointwise universal trigonometric series. For instance, if |a_n|=O(\e^{\,|n|\ln^{-1-\epsilon}|n|}) as |n|\to\infty for some \epsilon>0, then the series S_a can not be pointwise universal. On the other hand, there exists a pointwise universal trigonometric series S_a with |a_n|=O(\e^{\,|n|\ln^{-1}|n|}) as |n|\to\infty.
