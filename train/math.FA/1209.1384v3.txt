We establish exponential laws for certain spaces of differentiable functions over a valued field K.   For example, we show that the topological vector spaces C^{r,s}(U x V,E) and C^r(U,C^s(V,E)) are isomorphic if U and V are open subsets of K^n and K^m, respectively, E is a topological K-vector space, and r,s are degrees of differentiability.   As a first application, we study the density of locally polynomial functions in spaces of partially differentiable functions over an ultrametric field (thus solving an open problem by E. Nagel), and also global approximations by polynomial functions.   As a second application, we obtain a new proof for the characterization of C^r-functions on powers Z_p^n of the p-adic integers in terms of the decay of their Mahler expansions.   In both applications, the exponential laws enable simple inductive proofs via a reduction to the one-dimensional, vector-valued case.
