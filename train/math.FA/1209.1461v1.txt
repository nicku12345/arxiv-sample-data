Bounded linear operators on separable Banach spaces algebraically similar to the classical Volterra operator V acting on C[0,1] are characterized. From this characterization it follows that V does not determine the topology of C[0,1], which answers a question raised by Armando Villena. A sufficient condition for an injective bounded linear operator on a Banach space to determine its topology is obtained. From this condition it follows, for instance, that the Volterra operator acting on the Hardy space \H^p of the unit disk determines the topology of \H^p for any p\in[1,\infty].
