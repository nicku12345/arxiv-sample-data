We give a short proof of a recent result by Bernik, Mastnak, and Radjavi, stating that an irreducible group of complex matrices with nonnegative diagonal entries is diagonally similar to a group of nonnegative monomial matrices. We also explore the problem when an irreducible matrix semigroup in which each member is diagonally similar to a nonnegative matrix is diagonally similar to a semigroup of nonnegative matrices.
