We show that any random vector uniformly distributed on any hyperplane projection of B_1^n or B_\infty^n verifies the variance conjecture \text{Var}|X|^2\leq C\sup_{\xi\in S^{n-1}}\E<X,\xi>^2\E|X|^2. Furthermore, a random vector uniformly distributed on a hyperplane projection of B_\infty^n verifies a negative square correlation property and consequently any of its linear images verifies the variance conjecture.
