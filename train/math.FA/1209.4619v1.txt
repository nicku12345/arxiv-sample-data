We prove that a sequence (f_i)_{i=1}^\infty of translates of a fixed f\in L_p(R) cannot be an unconditional basis of L_p(R) for any 1\le p<\infty. In contrast to this, for every 2<p<\infty, d\in N and unbounded sequence (\lambda_n)_{n\in N}\subset R^d we establish the existence of a function f\in L_p(R^d) and sequence (g^*_n)_{n\in N}\subset L_p^*(R^d) such that (T_{\lambda_n} f, g^*_n)_{n\in N} forms an unconditional Schauder frame for L_p(R^d). In particular, there exists a Schauder frame of integer translates for L_p(R) if (and only if) 2<p<\infty.
