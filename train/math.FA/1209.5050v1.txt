For nonnegative integers n and k, we introduce in this paper a new class of (n,k)-quasi-*-paranormal operators satisfying   ||T^{1+n}(T^{k}x)||^{1/(1+n)}||T^{k}x||^{n/(1+n)} \geq   ||T^*(T^{k}x)|| \makebox{\ for all} x \in H.   This class includes the class of n-*-paranormal operators and the class of (1,k)-quasi-*-paranormal operators contains the class of k-quasi-*-class A operators. We study basic properties of (n,k)-quasi-*-paranormal operators: (1) inclusion relations and examples; (2) a matrix representation; (3) joint (approximate) point spectrum and single valued extension property.
