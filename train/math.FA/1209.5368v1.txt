It is shown that if C is a nonempty convex and weakly compact subset of a Banach space X with M(X)>1 and T:C\rightarrow C satisfies condition (C) or is continuous and satisfies condition (C_{\lambda}) for some \lambda \in (0,1), then T has a fixed point. In particular, our theorem holds for uniformly nonsquare Banach spaces. A similar statement is proved for nearly uniformly noncreasy spaces.
