Nagel and Stein established L^p-boundedness for a class of singular integrals of NIS type, that is, non-isotropic smoothing operators of order 0, on spaces \widetilde{M}=M_1\times...\times M_n, where each factor space M_i, 1\leq i\leq n, is a smooth manifold on which the basic geometry is given by a control, or Carnot--Carath\'eodory, metric induced by a collection of vector fields of finite type. In this paper we prove the product T1 theorem on L^2, the Hardy space H^p(\widetilde{M}) and the space CMO^p(\widetilde{M}), the dual of H^p(\widetilde{M}), for a class of product singular integral operators which covers Journ\'e's class and operators studied by Nagel and Stein.
