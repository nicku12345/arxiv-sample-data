For each p>2 we give intrinsic characterizations of the restriction of the homogeneous Sobolev space L^1_p(R^2) to an arbitrary finite subset E of R^2. The trace criterion is expressed in terms of certain weighted oscillations of the second order with respect to a measure generated by the Menger curvature of triangles with vertices in E.
