Let p>n and let L^1_p(R^n) be a homogeneous Sobolev space. For an arbitrary Borel measure \mu on R^n we give a constructive characterization of the space L^1_p(R^n)+L_p(R^n;\mu). We express the norm in this space in terms of certain oscillations with respect to the measure \mu. This enables us to describe the K-functional for the couple (L_p(R^n;\mu),L^1_p(R^n)) in terms of these oscillations, and to prove that this couple is quasi-linearizable.
