We consider certain anisotropic translation invariant pseudodifferential operators, belonging to a class denoted by \mathrm{op}(\mathcal{M}^{\lambda}_{\psi}), where \lambda and \psi=(\psi_1,\dots,\psi_n) are the "order" and "weight" functions, defined on \mathbb{R}^n, for the corresponding space of symbols. We prove that the boundedness of a suitable function F_p\colon\mathbb{R}^n\to[0,+\infty), 1<p<\infty, associated with \lambda and \psi, is necessary to let every element of \mathrm{op}(\mathcal{M}^{\lambda}_{\psi}) be a L^p(\mathbb{R}^n)-multiplier. Additionally, we show that some results known in the literature can be recovered as special cases of our necessary condition.
