Recently P. Das, S. Dutta and E. Savas introduced and studied the notions of strong A^I-summability with respect to an Orlicz function F and A^I-statistical convergence, where A is a non-negative regular matrix and I is an ideal on the set of natural numbers. In this note, we will generalise these notions by replacing A with a family of matrices and F with a family of Orlicz functions or moduli and study the thus obtained convergence methods. We will also give an application in Banach space theory, presenting a generalisation of Simons' \sup-\limsup-theorem to the newly introduced convergence methods (for the case that the filter generated by the ideal I has a countable base), continuing the author's previous work.
