Global and local regularities of functions are analyzed in anisotropic function spaces, under a common framework, that of hyperbolic wavelet bases. Local and directional regularity features are characterized by means of global quantities constructed upon the coefficients of hyperbolic wavelet decompositions. A multifractal analysis is introduced, that jointly accounts for scale invariance and anisotropy. Its properties are studied in depth.
