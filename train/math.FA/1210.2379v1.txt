For \Omega bounded and open subset of \mathbb{R}^{d_{0}} and X a reflexive Banach space with 1-symmetric basis, the function space JF_{X}(\Omega) is defined. This class of spaces includes the classical James function space. Every member of this class is separable and has non-separable dual. We provide a proof of topological nature that JF_{X}(\Omega) does not contain an isomorphic copy of \ell_{1}. We also investigate the structure of these spaces and their duals.
