In this paper the controllabillity and admissibility of perturbed semigroup systems are studied, using tools from the theory of interpolation and Carleson measures. In addition, there are new results on the perturbation of Carleson measures and on the weighted interpolation of functions and their derivatives in Hardy spaces, which are of interest in their own right.
