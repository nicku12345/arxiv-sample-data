We relate the injectivity of the canonical map from C(B_{E'}) to L_p(\mu), where \mu is a regular Borel probability measure on the closed unit ball B_{E'} of the dual E' of a Banach space E endowed with the weak* topology, to the existence of injective p-summing linear operators/p-dominated homogeneous polynomials defined on E having \mu as a Pietsch measure. As an application we fill the gap in the proofs of some results of concerning Pietsch-type factorization of dominated polynomials.
