In this paper, some Ostrowski type inequalities via Riemann-Liouville fractional integrals for h-convex functions, which are super-multiplicative or super-additive, are given. These results not only generalize those of Set (2012) and Tunc (2012), but also provide new estimates on these types of Ostrowski inequalities for fractional integrals.
