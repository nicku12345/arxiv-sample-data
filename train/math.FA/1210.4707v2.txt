We introduce an abstract framework for elliptic boundary value problems in a variational form. Given a non-negative quadratic form in a Hilbert space, a boundary pair consists of a bounded operator, the boundary operator, and an auxiliary Hilbert space, the boundary space, such that the boundary operator is bounded from the quadratic form domain into the auxiliary Hilbert space. These data determine a Neumann and Dirichlet operator, a Dirichlet solution and a Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator. The basic example we have in mind is a manifold with boundary, where the quadratic form is the integral over the squared derivative, and the boundary map is the restriction of a function to (a subset of) the boundary of the manifold. As one of the main theorems, we derive a resolvent formula relating the difference of the resolvents of the Neumann and Dirichlet operator with the Dirichlet solution and the Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator. From this, we deduce a spectral characterisation for a point being in the spectrum of the Neumann operator in terms of the family of Dirichlet-to-Neumann operators. The relation can be generalised also to Robin-type boundary conditions. We identify conditions expressed purely in terms of boundary pairs, which allow us to relate our concept with existing concepts such as boundary triples. We illustrate the theory by many examples including Jacobi operators, Laplacians on spaces with (non-smooth) boundary and the Zaremba (mixed boundary conditions) problem.
