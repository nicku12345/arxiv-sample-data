Semyanistyi's fractional integrals have come to analysis from integral geometry. They take functions on R^n to functions on hyperplanes, commute with rotations, and have a nice behavior with respect to dilations. We obtain sharp inequalities for these integrals and the corresponding Radon transforms acting on L^p spaces with a radial power weight. The operator norms are explicitly evaluated. Similar results are obtained for fractional integrals associated to k-plane transforms for any 1\le k<n.
