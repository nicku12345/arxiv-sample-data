We prove that every Banach space, not necessarily separable, can be isometrically embedded into a \mathcal L_{\infty}-space in a way that the corresponding quotient has the Radon-Nikodym and the Schur properties. As a consequence, we obtain \mathcal L_\infty spaces of arbitrary large densities with the Schur and the Radon-Nikodym properties. This extents the a classical result by J. Bourgain and G. Pisier.
