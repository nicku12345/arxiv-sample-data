We introduce and analyse the notion of slice continuity between operators on Banach spaces in the setting of the Daugavet property.   It is shown that under the slice continuity assumption the Daugavet equation holds for weakly compact operators. As an application we define and characterise the Daugavet property for bilinear maps, and we prove that this allows us to describe some p-convexifications of the Daugavet equation for operators on Banach function spaces that have recently been introduced.
