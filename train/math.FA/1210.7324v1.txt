We introduce a new class of Banach spaces, called generalized-lush spaces (GL-spaces for short), which contains almost-CL-spaces, separable lush spaces (specially, separable C-rich subspaces of C(K)), and even the two-dimensional space with hexagonal norm. We obtain that the space C(K,E) of the vector-valued continuous functions is a GL-space whenever E is, and show that the GL-space is stable under c_0-, l_1- and l_\infty-sums. As an application, we prove that the Mazur-Ulam property holds for a larger class of Banach spaces, called local-GL-spaces, including all lush spaces and GL-spaces. Furthermore, we generalize the stability properties of GL-spaces to local-GL-spaces. From this, we can obtain many examples of Banach spaces having the Mazur-Ulam property.
