A generalization of Problem 73 of Mazur and Orlicz in the Scottish Book was introduced from L. Harris. The exact value of the constant that appears there is known when complex normed linear spaces are considered. In this paper, we give estimates in the case of an arbitrary real normed linear space and a real \ell_p space. Moreover, if F(x) is a power series, \rho its radius of uniform convergence and \rho_{\substack{A}} its radius of analyticity, we prove that \rho_{\substack{A}}\geq\rho/\sqrt{2} and give some respective results for the nth Fr\'{e}chet derivative of F(x).
