We show that the direct sum of Banach spaces X_{1},..., X_{r} with a strictly monotone norm has the weak fixed point property for nonexpansive mappings whenever M(X_{i})>1 for each i=1,...,r. In particular, (X_{1} \oplus ... \oplus X_{r})_{\psi} enjoys the fixed point property if Banach spaces X_{i} are uniformly nonsquare. This combined with the earlier results gives a definitive answer for r=2: the direct sum of uniformly nonsquare spaces X_{1}, X_{2} with any monotone norm has FPP. Our results are extended for asymptotically nonexpansive mappings in the intermediate sense.
