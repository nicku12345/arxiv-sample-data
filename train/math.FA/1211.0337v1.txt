We prove that the HRT (Heil, Ramanathan, and Topiwala) conjecture holds for finite Gabor systems generated by square-integrable functions with certain behavior at infinity. These functions include functions ultimately decaying faster than any exponential function, as well as square-integrable functions ultimately analytic and whose germs are in a Hardy field. Two classes of the latter type of functions are the set of square-integrable logarithmico-exponential functions and the set of square-integrable Pfaffian functions. We also prove the HRT conjecture for certain finite Gabor systems generated by positive functions.
