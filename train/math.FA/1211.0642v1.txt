We define distribution spaces of a sequence of convolutions of a set of distributions with smooth functions, the shearlet system. Then, we define associated sequence spaces and prove characterizations. We also show a reproducing identity in the class of distributions. Finally, we prove Sobolev-type embeddings within the shear anisotropic inhomogeneous spaces and embeddings between (classical dyadic) isotropic inhomogeneous spaces and shear anisotropic inhomogeneous spaces.
