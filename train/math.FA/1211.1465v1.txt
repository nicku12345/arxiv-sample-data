A connection is a binary operation for positive operators satisfying the monotonicity, the transformer inequality and the joint-continuity from above. A mean is a normalized connection. In this paper, we show that there is a one-to-one correspondence between connections and finite Borel measures on the unit interval via a suitable integral representation. Every mean can be regarded as an average of weighted harmonic means. Moreover, we investigate decompositions of connections, means, symmetric connections and symmetric means.
