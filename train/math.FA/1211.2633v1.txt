We find the necessary and sufficient conditions for refinable step function under which this function generates an orthogonal MRA in the L_2(\mathfrak G) -spaces on Vilenkin groups \mathfrak G. We consider a class of refinable step functions for which the mask m_0(\chi) is constant on cosets \mathfrak G_{-1}^\bot and its modulus |m_0(\chi)| takes two values only: 0 and 1. We will prove that any refinable step function \varphi from this class that generates an orthogonal MRA on p-adic Vilenkin group \mathfrak G has Fourier transform with condition {\rm supp} \hat \varphi(\chi)\subset \mathfrak G_{p-2}^\bot. We show the sharpness of this result too.
