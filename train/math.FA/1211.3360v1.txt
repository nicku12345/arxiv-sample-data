We characterize the frames on an infinite dimensional separable Hilbert space that can be projected to a tight frame for an infinite dimensional subspace. A result of Casazza and Leon states that an arbitrary frame for a 2N- or (2N-1)-dimensional Hilbert space can be projected to a tight frame for an N-dimensional subspace. Surprisingly, we demonstrate a large class of frames for infinite dimensional Hilbert spaces which cannot be projected to a tight frame for any infinite dimensional subspace.
