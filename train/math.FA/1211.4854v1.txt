In the first part of the paper we prove that for 2 < p, r < \infty every operator T: L_p \to \ell_r is narrow. This completes the list of sequence and function Lebesgue spaces X with the property that every operator T:L_p \to X is narrow.   Next, using similar methods we prove that every \ell_2-strictly singular operator from L_p, 1<p<\infty, to any Banach space with an unconditional basis, is narrow, which partially answers a question of Plichko and Popov posed in 1990.   A theorem of H. P. Rosenthal asserts that if an operator T on L_1[0,1] satisfies the assumption that for each measurable set A \subseteq [0,1] the restriction T \bigl|_{L_1(A)} is not an isomorphic embedding, then T is narrow.   (Here L_1(A) = \{x \in L_1: {\rm supp} \, x \subseteq A\}.) Inspired by this result, in the last part of the paper, we find a sufficient condition, of a different flavor than being \ell_2-strictly singular, for operators on L_p[0,1], 1<p<2, to be narrow. We define a notion of a "gentle" growth of a function and we prove that for 1 < p < 2 every operator T on L_p which, for every A\subseteq[0,1], sends a function of "gentle" growth supported on A to a function of arbitrarily small norm is narrow.
