The interpolation property of Ces{\`a}ro sequence and function spaces is investigated. It is shown that Ces_p(I) is an interpolation space between Ces_{p_0}(I) and Ces_{p_1}(I) for 1 < p_0 < p_1 \leq \infty and 1/p = (1 - \theta)/p_0 + \theta /p_1 with 0 < \theta < 1, where I = [0, \infty) or [0, 1]. The same result is true for Ces{\`a}ro sequence spaces. On the other hand, Ces_p[0, 1] is not an interpolation space between Ces_1[0, 1] and Ces_{\infty}[0, 1].
