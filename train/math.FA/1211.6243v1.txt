In this paper, we prove an analogue of the Jordan canonical form theorem for a class of n-normal operators on complex separable Hilbert spaces in terms of von Neumann's reduction theory. This is a continuation of our study of bounded linear operators, the commutants of which contain bounded maximal abelian set of idempotents. Furthermore, we give a complete similarity invariant for this class of operators by K-theory for Banach algebras.
