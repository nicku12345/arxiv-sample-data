We introduce the notion of strongly orthogonal set relative to an element in the sense of Birkhoff-James in a normed linear space to find a necessary and sufficient condition for an element  x  of the unit sphere  S_{X} to be an exposed point of the unit ball  B_X . We then prove that a normed linear space is strictly convex iff for each element x of the unit sphere there exists a bounded linear operator A on X which attains its norm only at the points of the form  \lambda x  with  \lambda \in S_{K} .
