We use the notion of \A-compact sets, which are determined by a Banach operator ideal \A, to show that most classic results of certain approximation properties and several Banach operator ideals can be systematically studied under this framework. We say that a Banach space enjoys the \A-approximation property if the identity map is uniformly approximable on \A-compact sets by finite rank operators. The Grothendieck's classic approximation property is the \K-approximation property for \K the ideal of compact operators and the p-approximation property is obtained as the \mathcal N^p-approximation property for \mathcal N^p the ideal of right p-nuclear operators. We introduce a way to measure the size of \A-compact sets and use it to give a norm on \K_\A, the ideal of \A-compact operators. Most of our results concerning the operator Banach ideal \K_\A are obtained for right-accessible ideals \A. For instance, we prove that \K_\A is a dual ideal, it is regular and we characterize its maximal hull. A strong concept of approximation property, which makes use of the norm defined on \K_\A, is also addressed. Finally, we obtain a generalization of Schwartz theorem with a revisited \epsilon-product.
