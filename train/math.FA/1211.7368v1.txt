We define a trivolution on a complex algebra A as a non-zero conjugate-linear, anti-homomorphism \tau on A, which is a generalized inverse of itself, that is, \tau^3=\tau. We give several characterizations of trivolutions and show with examples that they appear naturally on many Banach algebras, particularly those arising from group algebras. We give several results on the existence or non-existence of involutions on the dual of a topologically introverted space. We investigate conditions under which the dual of a topologically introverted space admits trivolutions.
