We introduce a notion of p-orthogonality in a general Banach space 1 \le p \le \infty. We use this concept to characterize \ell_p-spaces among Banach spaces and also among complete order smooth p-normed spaces. We further introduce a notion of p-orthogonal decomposition in order smooth p-normed spaces. We prove that if the \infty-orthogonal decomposition holds in an order smooth \infty-normed space, then the 1-orthogonal decomposition holds in the dual space. We also give an example to show that the above said decomposition may not be unique.
