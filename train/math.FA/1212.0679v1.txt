The conditions on a Banach space, E, under which the algebra, \mathcal{K}(E), of compact operators on E is right flat or homologically unital are investigated. These homological properties are related to factorization in the algebra and it is shown that, for \mathcal{K}(E), they are closely associated with the approximation property for E. The class of spaces, E, such that \mathcal{K}(E) is known to be right flat and homologically unital is extended to include spaces which do not have the bounded compact approximation property.
