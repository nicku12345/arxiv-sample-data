We study complex interpolation of weighted Besov and Lizorkin-Triebel spaces. The used weights w_0,w_1 are local Muckenhoupt weights in the sense of Rychkov. As a first step we calculate the Calder\'on products of associated sequence spaces. Finally, as a corollary of these investigations, we obtain results on complex interpolation of radial subspaces of Besov and Lizorkin-Triebel spaces on \R^d.
