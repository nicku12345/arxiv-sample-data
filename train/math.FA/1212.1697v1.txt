The main goal of this paper is to prove a two-weight criteria for multidimensio-nal Hardy type operator from weighted Lebesgue spaces into p-convex weighted Banach function spaces. Analogously problem for the dual operator is considered. As application we prove a two-weight criteria for boundedness of multidimensional geometric mean operator and sufficient condition on the weights for boundedness of certain sublinear operator from weighted Lebesgue spaces into weighted Musielak-Orlicz spaces.
