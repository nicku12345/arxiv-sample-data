In this paper, we investigate the various different generalized inverses in a Banach algebra with respect to prescribed two idempotents p and q. Some new characterizations and explicit representations for these generalized inverses, such as a^{(2)}_{p,q}, a^{(1,2)}_{p,q} and a^{(2,l)}_{p,q} will be presented. The obtained results extend and generalize some well--known results for matrices or operators.
