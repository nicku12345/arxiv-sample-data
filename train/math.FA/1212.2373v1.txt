We generalize the classical Muckenhoupt inequality with two measures to three under appropriate conditions. As a consequence, we prove a simple characterization of the undedness of the multiplication operator and thus of the boundedness of the zeros and the asymptotic behavior of the Sobolev orthogonal polynomials, for a large class of measures which includes the most usual examples in the literature.
