We show that if a weight w\in C^d_{2t} and there is q >1 such that w^{2t}\in A_q^d, then the L^2-norm of the t-Haar multiplier of complexity (m,n) associated to w depends on the square root of the C^d_{2t}-characteristic of w times the square root A^d_q-characteristic of w^{2t} % raised to the power (p-1)/2 times a constant that depends polynomially on the complexity. In particular, if w\in C^d_{2t}\cap A_{\infty}^d then w^{2t}\in A_q^d for some q>1.
