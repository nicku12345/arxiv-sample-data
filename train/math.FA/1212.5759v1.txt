O. Lazarev and E. H. Lieb proved that given f_{1},...,f_{n}\in L^{1}([0,1];\mathbb{C}), there exists a smooth function \Phi that takes values on the unit circle and annihilates {span}\{f_{1},...,f_{n}}. We give an alternative proof of that fact that also shows the W^{1,1} norm of \Phi can be bounded by 5\pi n+1. Answering a question raised by Lazarev and Lieb, we show that if p>1 then there is no bound for the W^{1,p} norm of any such multiplier in terms of the norms of f_{1},...,f_{n}.
