For a set \mathbb{W} \subset L_p(\bT^d), 1 < p < \infty, of multivariate periodic functions on the torus \bT^d and a given function \varphi \in L_p(\bT^d), we study the approximation in the L_p(\bT^d)-norm of functions f \in \mathbb{W} by arbitrary linear combinations of n translates of \varphi. For \mathbb{W} = U^r_p(\bT^d) and \varphi = \kappa_{r,d}, we prove upper bounds of the worst case error of this approximation where U^r_p(\bT^d) is the unit ball in the Korobov space K^r_p(\bT^d) and \kappa_{r,d} is the associated Korobov function. To obtain the upper bounds, we construct approximation methods based on sparse Smolyak grids. The case p=2, \ r > 1/2, is especially important since K^r_2(\bT^d) is a reproducing kernel Hilbert space, whose reproducing kernel is a translation kernel determined by \kappa_{r,d}. We also provide lower bounds of the optimal approximation on the best choice of \varphi.
