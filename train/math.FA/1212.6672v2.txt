For \mathbb{K}=\mathbb{R} or \mathbb{C} and m a positive integer, we remark that there is a constant C so that, for all r\in\lbrack1,\frac {2m}{m+1}], the supremum of the ratio between the \ell_{r} norm of the coefficients of any nonzero m-homogeneous polynomial P:\ell_{\infty}% ^{n}(\mathbb{K}) \rightarrow\mathbb{K} and its supremum norm is dominated by C^{m}\cdot n^{(\frac{m}{r}-\frac{m+1}{2})} and, moreover, we prove that the exponent \frac{m}{r}-\frac{m+1}{2} is optimal.
