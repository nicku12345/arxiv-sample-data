We extend in this article the classical Sobolev inequalities for the module of continuity for the functions belonging to the integer order Sobolev's space on the Sobolev-Bilateral Grand Lebesgue spaces.   As a consequence, we deduce the fractional Orlicz-Sobolev imbedding theorems and investigate the rectangle module of continuity of non-Gaussian multiparameter random fields.
