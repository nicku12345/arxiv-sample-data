Suppose that E is a uniformly complete vector lattice and p_1,..., p_n are positive reals. We prove that the diagonal of the Fremlin projective tensor product of E_{(p_1)},..., E_{(p_n)} can be identified with E_{(p)} where p = p_1+...+p_n and E_{(p)} stands for the p-concavification of E. We also provide a variant of this result for Banach lattices. This extends the main result of [BBPTT].
