Let X,Y be normal bounded operators on a Hilbert space such that e^X=e^Y. If the spectra of X and Y are contained in the strip \s of the complex plane defined by |\Im(z)|\leq \pi, we show that |X|=|Y|. If Y is only assumed to be bounded, then |X|Y=Y|X|. We give a formula for X-Y in terms of spectral projections of X and Y provided that X,Y are normal and e^X=e^Y. If X is an unbounded self-adjoint operator, which does not have (2k+1) \pi, k \in \ZZ, as eigenvalues, and Y is normal with spectrum in \s satisfying e^{iX}=e^Y, then Y \in \{\, e^{iX} \, \}". We give alternative proofs and generalizations of results on normal operator exponentials proved by Ch. Schmoeger.
