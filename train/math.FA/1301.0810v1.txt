It is known that, in finite dimensions, the support function of a compact convex set with non empty interior is differentiable excepting the origin if and only if the set is strictly convex. In this paper we realize a thorough study of the relations between the differentiability of the support function on the interior of its domain and the convexity of the set, mainly for unbounded sets. Then we revisit some results related to the differentiability of the cost function associated to a production function.
