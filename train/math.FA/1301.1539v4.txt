The main motivation of this paper is the following open problem: Is the hypercontractivity of the \emph{complex} polynomial Bohnenblust--Hille inequality an optimal result? We show that the solution to this problem has a close connection with the searching of the optimal constants for the \emph{real} polynomial Bohnenblust--Hille inequality. So we are lead to a detailed study of the hypercontractivity constants for real scalars. In fact we study two notions of constants of hypercontractivity: absolute (H_{a,\mathbb{R}}) and asymptotic (H_{\infty,\mathbb{R}}). Among other results, our estimates combined with recent results from \cite{CMPS} show that \[ 1.5098<H_{\infty,\mathbb{R}}<2.829 \quad \text{and} \quad 1.6561<H_{a,\mathbb{R}}<3.296. \]
