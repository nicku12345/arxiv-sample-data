Let A be a Banach algebra and X be a Banach A-bimodule. A mapping D :A\longrightarrow X is a cubic derivation if D is a cubic homogeneous mapping, that is D is cubic and D(\lambda a)={\lambda}^3 D(a) for any complex number \lambda and all a\in A, and D(ab)=D(a)\cdot b^3 +a^3\cdot D(b) for all a,b\in A. In this paper, we prove the stability of a cubic derivation with direct method. We also employ a fixed point method to establish of the stability and the superstability for cubic derivations.
