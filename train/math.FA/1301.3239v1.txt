This paper continues the investigation of Esslamzadeh and the first author which was begun in [7]. It is shown that homomorphic image of an approximately cyclic amenable Banach algebra is again approximately cyclic amenable. Equivalence of approximate cyclic amenability of a Banach algebra \mathcal{A} and approximate cyclic amenability of M_{n}(\mathcal{A}) is proved. It is shown that under certain conditions the approximate cyclic amenability of second dual \mathcal{A}^{**} implies the approximate cyclic amenability of \mathcal{A}.
