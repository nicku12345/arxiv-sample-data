Let X, Y be two real Banach spaces and \varepsilon>0. A standard \varepsilon-isometry f:X\rightarrow Y is said to be (\alpha,\gamma)-stable (with respect to T:L(f)\equiv\overline{{\rm span}}f(X)\rightarrow X for some \alpha, \gamma>0) if T is a linear operator with \|T\|\leq\alpha so that Tf-Id is uniformly bounded by \gamma\varepsilon on X. The pair (X,Y) is said to be stable if every standard \varepsilon-isometry f:X\rightarrow Y is (\alpha,\gamma)-stable for some \alpha,\gamma>0. X (Y) is said to be universally left (right)-stable, if (X,Y) is always stable for every Y (X). In this paper, we show that universal right-stability spaces are just Hilbert spaces; every injective space is universally left-stable; a Banach space X isomorphic to a subspace of \ell_\infty is universally left-stable if and only if it is isomorphic to \ell_\infty; and that a separable space X satisfies the condition that (X,Y) is left-stable for every separable Y if and only if it is isomorphic to c_0.
