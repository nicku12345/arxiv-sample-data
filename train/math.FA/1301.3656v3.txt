Let X, Y be two real Banach spaces, and \eps\geq0. A map f:X\rightarrow Y is said to be a standard \eps-isometry if |\|f(x)-f(y)\|-\|x-y\||\leq\eps for all x,y\in X and with f(0)=0. We say that a pair of Banach spaces (X,Y) is stable if there exists \gamma>0 such that for every such \eps and every standard \eps-isometry f:X\rightarrow Y there is a bounded linear operator T:L(f)\equiv\overline{{\rm span}}f(X)\rightarrow X such that \|Tf(x)-x\|\leq\gamma\eps for all x\in X. X (Y) is said to be left (right)-universally stable, if (X,Y) is always stable for every Y (X). In this paper, we show that if a dual Banach space X is universally-left-stable, then it is isometric to a complemented w^*-closed subspace of \ell_\infty(\Gamma) for some set \Gamma, hence, an injective space; and that a Banach space is universally-left-stable if and only if it is a cardinality injective space; and universally-left-stability spaces are invariant.
