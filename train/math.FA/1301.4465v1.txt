Using a nonlinear version of the well known Hardy-Littlewood inequalities, we derive new formulas for decreasing rearrangements of functions and sequences in the context of convex functions. We use these formulas for deducing several properties of the modular functionals defining the function and sequence spaces M_{\varphi,w} and m_{\varphi,w} respectively, introduced earlier in \cite{HKM} for describing the K\"othe dual of ordinary Orlicz-Lorentz spaces in a large variety of cases (\varphi is an Orlicz function and w a {\it decreasing} weight). We study these M_{\varphi,w} classes in the most general setting, where they may even not be linear, and identify their K\"othe duals with ordinary (Banach) Orlicz-Lorentz spaces. We introduce a new class of rearrangement invariant Banach spaces \mathcal{M}_{\varphi,w} which proves to be the K\"othe biduals of the M_{\varphi,w} classes. In the case when the class M_{\varphi,w} is a separable quasi-Banach space, \mathcal{M}_{\varphi,w} is its Banach envelope.
