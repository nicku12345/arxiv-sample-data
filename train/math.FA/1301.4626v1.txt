We study infinite products of reproducing kernels with view to their use in dynamics (of iterated function systems), in harmonic analysis, and in stochastic processes. On the way, we construct a new family of representations of the Cuntz relations. Then, using these representations we associate a fixed filled Julia set with a Hilbert space. This is based on analysis and conformal geometry of a fixed rational mapping R in one complex variable, and its iterations.
