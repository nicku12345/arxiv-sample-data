The uniform norm on a uniform normed Q-algebra is the only uniform Q-algebra norm on it. The uniform norm on a regular uniform normed Q-algebra with unit is the only uniform norm on it. Let A be a uniform topological algebra whose spectrum M (A) is equicontinuous, then A is a uniform normed algebra. Let A be a regular semisimple commutative Banach algebra, then every algebra norm on A is a Q-algebra norm on A.
