In this paper we consider composition operator C_{\varphi} generated by nonsingular measurable transformation T and multiplication operator M_u generated by measurable function u between two different Orlicz spaces, then we investigate boundedness, compactness and essential norm of multiplication and composition operators in term of properties of the mapping \varphi, the function u and the measure space (X, \Sigma, \mu).
