We present a general method for constructing operators without non-trivial invariant closed subsets on a large class of non-reflexive Banach spaces. In particular, our approach unifies and generalizes several constructions due to Read of operators without non-trivial invariant subspaces on the spaces \ell_{1}, c_{0} or \oplus_{\ell_{2}}J, and without non-trivial invariant subsets on \ell_{1}. We also investigate how far our methods can be extended to the Hilbertian setting, and construct an operator on a quasireflexive dual Banach space which has no non-trivial w^{*}-closed invariant subspace.
