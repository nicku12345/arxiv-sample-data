Using Read's construction of operators without non-trivial invariant subspaces/subsets on \ell_{1} or c_{0}, we construct examples of operators on a Hilbert space whose set of hypercyclic vectors is "large" in various senses. We give an example of an operator such that the closure of every orbit is a closed subspace, and then, answering a question of D. Preiss, an example of an operator such that the set of its non-hypercyclic vectors is Gauss null. This operator has the property that it is orbit-unicellular, i.e. the family of the closures of its orbits is totally ordered. We also exhibit an example of an operator on a Hilbert space which is not orbit-reflexive.
