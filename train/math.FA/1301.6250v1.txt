We prove that a separable Banach space E does not contain a copy of the space \co of null-sequences if and only if for every doubly power-bounded operator T on E and for every vector x\in E the relative compactness of the sets \{T^{n+m}x-T^nx: n\in \NN\} (for some/all m\in\NN, m\geq 1) and \{T^nx:n\in \NN\} are equivalent. With the help of the Jacobs--de Leeuw--Glicksberg decomposition of strongly compact semigroups the case of (not necessarily invertible) power-bounded operators is also handled.
