The upper estimates for the optimal constants of the multilinear Bohnenblust--Hille inequality obtained in [J. Funct. Anal. 264 (2013), 429--463] are here improved to: {0.1cm}   {enumerate} For real scalars: K_{n}\leq\sqrt{2}(n-1)^{0.526322}. For complex scalars: K_{n}\leq\frac{2}{\sqrt{\pi}}(n-1)^{0.304975}.{enumerate} {0.1cm} \noindent We also obtain sharper estimates for higher values of n. For instance, \[ K_{n}<1.30379(n-1) ^{0.526322}\] for real scalars and n>2^{8} and \[ K_{n}<0.99137(n-1) ^{0.304975}\] for complex scalars and n > 2^{15}.
