In this paper, we mainly study the trace norm of the adjacency matrix of a graph, also known as the energy of graph. We give the maximum trace norms for the graph and its complement. In fact, the above problem is stated and solved in a more general setup - for nonnegative matrices with bounded entries. In particular, this study exhibits analytical matrix functions attaining maxima on matrices with rigid and complex combinatorial structure. In the last section the same questions are studied for Ky Fan norms. Possibe directions for further research are outlined, as it turns out that the above problems are just a tip of a larger multidimensional research area.
