Let B, I be the unweighted backward shift and the identity operator respectively on l^{\infty}(\mathbb{N}), the space of bounded sequences over the complex numbers endowed with the supremum norm. We prove that I+\lambda B is locally topologically transitive if and only if |\lambda |>2. This, shows that a classical result of Salas, which says that backward shift perturbations of the identity operator are always hypercyclic, or equivalently topologically transitive, on l^p(\mathbb{N}), 1\leq p<+\infty, fails to hold for the notion of local topological transitivity on l^{\infty}(\mathbb{N}). We also obtain further results which complement certain results from \cite{CosMa}.
