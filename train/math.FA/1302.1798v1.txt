We study a class of dynamical systems in L^2 spaces of infinite products X. Fix a compact Hausdorff space B. Our setting encompasses such cases when the dynamics on X = B^\bn is determined by the one-sided shift in X, and by a given transition-operator R. Our results apply to any positive operator R in C(B) such that R1 = 1. From this we obtain induced measures \Sigma on X, and we study spectral theory in the associated L^2(X,\Sigma).   For the second class of dynamics, we introduce a fixed endomorphism r in the base space B, and specialize to the induced solenoid \Sol(r). The solenoid \Sol(r) is then naturally embedded in X = B^\bn, and r induces an automorphism in \Sol(r). The induced systems will then live in L^2(\Sol(r), \Sigma).   The applications include wavelet analysis, both in the classical setting of \br^n, and Cantor-wavelets in the setting of fractals induced by affine iterated function systems (IFS). But our solenoid analysis includes such hyperbolic systems as the Smale-Williams attractor, with the endomorphism r there prescribed to preserve a foliation by meridional disks. And our setting includes the study of Julia set-attractors in complex dynamics.
