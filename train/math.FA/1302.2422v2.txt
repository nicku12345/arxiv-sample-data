For 0<p<\infty , the Dirichlet-type space \Dp consists of those analytic functions f in the unit disc \D such that \int_\D|f'(z)|\sp p(1-|z|)^{p-1}\,dA(z)<\infty. Motivated by operator theoretic differences between the Hardy space H^p and \Dp, the integral operator {displaymath} T_g(f)(z)=\int_{0}^{z}f(\zeta)\,g'(\zeta)\,d\zeta,\quad z\in\D, {displaymath} acting from one of these spaces to another is studied. In particular, it is shown, on one hand, that T_g:\Dp\to H^p is bounded if and only if g\in\BMOA when 0<p\le 2, and, on the other hand, that this equivalence is very far from being true if p>2. Those symbols g such that T_g:\Dp\to H^q is bounded (or compact) when p<q are also characterized. Moreover, the best known sufficient L^\infty-type condition for a positive Borel measure \mu on \D to be a p-Carleson measures for \Dp, p>2, is significantly relaxed, and the established result is shown to be sharp in a very strong sense.
