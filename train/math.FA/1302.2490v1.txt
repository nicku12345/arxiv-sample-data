Let T be a compact operator on a separable Hilbert space H. We show that, for 2\le p<\infty, T belongs to the Schatten class S_p if and only if \{\|Tf_n\|\}\in \ell^p for \emph{every} frame \{f_n\} in H; and for 0<p\le2, T belongs to S_p if and only if \{\|Tf_n\|\}\in\ell^p for \emph{some} frame \{f_n\} in H. Similar conditions are also obtained in terms of the sequence \{<Tf_n,f_n>\} and the double-indexed sequence \{<Tf_n,f_m>\}.
