Let S be a semitopological semigroup and \mathcal{CB}(S) denotes the C^*-algebra of all bounded complex valued continuous functions on S with uniform norm. A function f\in \mathcal{CB}(S) is left multiplicative \linebreak continuous if and only if \mathbf{T}_{\mu}f\in \mathcal{CB}(S) for all \mu in the spectrum of \mathcal{CB}(S), where \mathbf{T}_{\mu}f(s)=\mu(L_sf) and L_sf(x)=f(sx) for each s,x\in S. The collection of all left multiplicative continuous functions on S is denoted by Lmc(S). In this paper, the Lmc-compactification of a semitopological semigroup S is reconstructed as a space of e-ultrafilters. This construction is applied to obtain some algebraic properties of \linebreak (\varepsilon ,\s), that  \s  is the spectrum of Lmc(S), for semitopological semigroups S. It is shown that if S is a locally compact semitopological semigroup, then S^*=\s \setminus \varepsilon(S) is a left ideal of \s if and only if for each x,y\in S, there exists a compact zero set A such that x\in A and \{t\in S:yt\in A\} is a compact set.
