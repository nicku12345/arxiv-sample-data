Let S be a semitopological semigroup. The wap- compactification of semigroup S, is a compact semitopological semigroup with certain universal properties relative to the original semigroup, and the Lmc- compactification of semigroup S is a universal semigroup compactification of S, which are denoted by S^{wap} and S^{Lmc} respectively. In this paper, an internal construction of the wap-compactification of a semitopological semigroup is constructed as a space of z-filters. Also we obtain the cardinality of S^{wap} and show that if S^{wap} is the one point compactification then (S^{Lmc}-S)*S^{Lmc} is dense in S^{Lmc}-S.
