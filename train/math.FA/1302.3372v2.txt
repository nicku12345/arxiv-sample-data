We introduce algebras which are inductive limits of Banach spaces and carry inequalities which are counterparts of the inequality for the norm in a Banach algebra. We then define an associated Wiener algebra, and prove the corresponding version of the well-known Wiener theorem. Finally, we consider factorization theory in these algebra, and in particular, in the associated Wiener algebra.
