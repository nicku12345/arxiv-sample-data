This paper considers homogeneous order preserving continuous maps on the normal cone of an ordered normed vector space. It is shown that certain operators of that kind which are not necessarily compact themselves but have a compact power have a positive eigenvector that is associated with the cone spectral radius. We also derive conditions for the existence of homogeneous order preserving eigenfunctionals. Our results are illustrated in a model for spatially distributed two-sex populations.
