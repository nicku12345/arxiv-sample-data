The Riemann Mapping Theorem states existence of a conformal homeomorphism \varphi of a simply connected plane domain \Omega\subset\mathbb C with non-empty boundary onto the unit disc \mathbb D\subset \mathbb C. In the first part of the paper we study embeddings of Sobolev spaces \overset{\circ}{W_{p}^{1}}(\Omega) into weighted Lebesgue spaces L_{q}(\Omega,h) with an {}"universal" weight that is Jacobian of \varphi i.e. h(z):=J(z,\varphi)=| \varphi'(z)|^2. Weighted Lebesgue spaces with such weights depend only on a conformal structure of \Omega. By this reason we call the weights h(z) conformal weights. In the second part of the paper we prove compactness of embeddings of Sobolev spaces \overset{\circ}{W_{2}^{1}}(\Omega) into L_{q}(\Omega,h) for any 1\leq q<\infty. With the help of Brennan's conjecture we extend these results to Sobolev spaces \overset{\circ}{W_{p}^{1}}(\Omega). In this case q is not arbitrary and depends on p and the summability exponent for Brennan's conjecture. Applications to elliptic boundary value problems are demonstrated in the last part of the paper.
