There exist simple dimension groups which cannot be expressed as a direct limit of simple, or even approximately divisible dimension groups, each with finitely many pure traces, and we can specify its infinite-dimensional Choquet simplex of traces; a more drastic property is noted. On the other hand, a very easy argument shows that if G is a p-divisible simple dimension group (for some integer p>1), then it can be expressed as such a direct limit. We also enlarge the class of initial objects for AF (and slightly more general) C*-algebras.
