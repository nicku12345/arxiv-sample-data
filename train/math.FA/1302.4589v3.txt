We give a new approach, inspired by H\"ormander's L^2-method, to weighted variance inequalities which extend results obtained by Bobkov and Ledoux. It provides in particular a local proof of the dimensional functional forms of the Brunn-Minkowski inequalities. We also present several applications of these variance inequalities, including reverse H\"older inequalities for convex functions, weighted Brascamp-Lieb inequalities and sharp weighted Poincar\'{e} inequalities for generalized Cauchy measures.
