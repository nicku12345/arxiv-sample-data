In this article we prove that every isometric copy of C(L) in C(K) is complemented if L is compact Hausdorff of finite height and K is a compact Hausdorff space satisfying the extension property, i.e., every closed subset of K admits an extension operator. The space C(L) can be replaced by its subspace C(L|F) consisting of functions that vanish on a closed subset F of L. We also study the class of spaces having the extension property, establishing some closure results for this class and relating it to other classes of compact spaces.
