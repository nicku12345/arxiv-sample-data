We show that the dual to any subspace of c_0(\Gamma) has the strongest possible quantitative version of the Schur property. Further, we establish relationship between the quantitative Schur property and quantitative versions of the Dunford-Pettis property. Finally, we apply these results to show, in particular, that any subspace of the space of compact operators on \ell_p (1<p<\infty) with Dunford-Pettis property satisfies automatically both its quantitative versions.
