We prove that the known sufficient conditions on the real parameters (p,q) for which the matrix power mean inequality ((A^p+B^p)/2)^{1/p}\le((A^q+B^q)/2)^{1/q} holds for every pair of matrices A,B>0 are indeed best possible. The proof proceeds by constructing 2\times2 counterexamples. The best possible conditions on (p,q) for which \Phi(A^p)^{1/p}\le\Phi(A^q)^{1/q} holds for every unital positive linear map \Phi and A>0 are also clarified.
