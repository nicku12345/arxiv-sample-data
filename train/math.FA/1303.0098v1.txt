We present a natural and simple proof of the Radon - Nikodym theorem for measures with values in the space of bounded linear operators on a separable Hilbert space. This space is not separable, that is why it is essential to assume in the theorem that the range of the measure is separable. We also discuss distinctions between uniform and strong operator measures (Remark 3.3 to Lemma 3.2, Theorem 3.5 and its Corollary 3.6).   Proof of this version of the Radon - Nikodym theorem either is not presented in known literature, or given for special cases and with some inaccuracies (see Comment at the end of the paper), or given in too general form (e. g., Bourbaki) and uses notations that make it hard to apply the theorem.
