Given discrete subsets \Lambda_j\subset {\Bbb R}^d, j=1,...,q, consider the set of windowed exponentials \bigcup_{j=1}^{q}\{g_j(x)e^{2\pi i <\lambda,x>}: \lambda\in\Lambda_j\} on L^2(\Omega). We show that a necessary and sufficient condition for the windows g_j to form a frame of windowed exponentials for L^2(\Omega) with some \Lambda_j is that m\leq \max_{j\in J}|g_j|\leq M almost everywhere on \Omega for some subset J of \{1,..., q\}. If \Omega is unbounded, we show that there is no frame of windowed exponentials if the Lebesgue measure of \Omega is infinite. If \Omega is unbounded but of finite measure, we give a sufficient condition for the existence of Fourier frames on L^2(\Omega). At the same time, we also construct examples of unbounded sets with finite measure that have no tight exponential frame.
