For all the convolution algebras L^1[0,1),\ L^1_{\text{loc}} and A(\omega)=\bigcap_n L^1(\omega_n), the derivations are of the form D_{\mu} f=Xf*\mu for suitable measures \mu, where (Xf)(t)=tf(t). We describe the (weakly) compact as well as the (weakly) Montel derivations on these algebras in terms of properties of the measure \mu. Moreover, for all these algebras we show that the extension of D_{\mu} to a natural dual space is weak-star continuous.
