We prove several Paley--Wiener-type theorems related to the spherical transform on the Gelfand pair \big(H_n\rtimes U(n),U(n)\big), where H_n is the 2n+1-dimensional Heisenberg group.   Adopting the standard realization of the Gelfand spectrum as the Heisenberg fan in {\mathbb R}^2, we prove that spherical transforms of  U(n)--invariant functions and distributions with compact support in H_n admit unique entire extensions to {\mathbb C}^2, and we find real-variable characterizations of such transforms. Next, we characterize the inverse spherical transforms of compactly supported functions and distributions on the fan, giving analogous characterizations.
