In this paper we provide a study of quaternionic inner product spaces. This includes ortho-complemented subspaces, fundamental decompositions as well as a number of results of topological nature. Our main purpose is to show that a uniformly positive subspace in a quaternionic Krein space is ortho-complemented, and this leads to our choice of the results presented in the paper.
