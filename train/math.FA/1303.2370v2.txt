We present a reflexive Banach space with an unconditional basis which is quasi-minimal and tight by range, i.e. of type (4) in Ferenczi-Rosendal list within the framework of Gowers' classification program of Banach spaces, but contrary to the recently constructed space of type (4) also tight with constants, thus essentially extending the list of known examples in Gowers classification program. The space is defined on the base on a boundedly modified mixed Tsirelson space with use of a special coding function.
