We provide explicit criteria for wavelets to give rise to frames and atomic decompositions in {\rm L}^2(\mathbb{R}^d), but also in more general Banach function spaces. We consider wavelet systems that arise by translating and dilating the mother wavelet, with the dilations taken from a suitable subgroup of {\rm GL}(\mathbb{R}^d), the so-called {\em dilation group}.The paper provides a unified approach that is applicable to a wide range of dilation groups, thus giving rise to new atomic decompositions for homogeneous Besov spaces in arbitrary dimensions, but also for other function spaces such as shearlet coorbit spaces.   The atomic decomposition results are obtained by applying the coorbit theory developed by Feichtinger and Gr\"ochenig, and they can be informally described as follows: Given a function \psi \in {\rm L}^2(\mathbb{R}^d) satisfying fairly mild decay, smoothness and vanishing moment conditions, {\em any} sufficiently fine sampling of the translations and dilations will give rise to a wavelet frame. Furthermore, the containment of the analyzed signal in certain smoothness spaces (generalizing the homogeneous Besov spaces) can be decided by looking at the frame coefficients, and convergence of the frame expansion holds in the norms of these spaces. We motivate these results by discussing nonlinear approximation.
