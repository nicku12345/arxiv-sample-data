We study the finite dimensional spaces V which are invariant under the action of the finite differences operator \Delta_h^m. Concretely, we prove that if V is such an space, there exists a finite dimensional translation invariant space W such that V\subseteq W. In particular, all elements of V are exponential polynomials. Furthermore, V admits a decomposition V=P\oplus E with P a space of polynomials and E a translation invariant space. As a consequence of this study, we prove a generalization of a famous result by P. Montel which states that, if f:\mathbb{R}\to \mathbb{C} is a continuous function satisfying \Delta_{h_1}^mf(t) = \Delta_{h_2}^mf(t)=0 for all t\in\mathbb{R} and certain h_1,h_2\in\mathbb{R}\setminus\{0\} such that h_1/h_2\not\in\mathbb{Q}, then f(t)=a_0+a_1t+\cdots+a_{m-1}t^{m-1} for all t\in\mathbb{R} and certain complex numbers a_0,a_1,\cdots,a_{m-1}. We demonstrate, with quite different arguments, the same result not only for ordinary functions f(t) but also for complex valued distributions. Finally, we also consider in this paper the subspaces V which are \Delta_{h_1h_2\cdots h_m}-invariant for all h_1,\cdots,h_m\in\mathbb{R}.
