We continue the study undertaken in \cite{GHN} of left democracy function h_l(N)=\inf_{#\Lambda=N}\left\|\sum_{n\in \Lambda_N} x_n\right\|  of an unconditional basis in a Banach space X. We provide an example of a basis with h_l non-doubling. Then we show that for bases with non-doubling h_l the greedy projection is not optimal. Together with results from \cite{GHN} and improved by C. Cabrelli, G. Garrig\'os, E. Hernandez and U. Molter we get that the basis is greedy if and only if the greedy projection is optimal.
