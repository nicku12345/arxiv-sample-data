In this work we propose to study the general Robin boundary value problem involving signed smooth measures on an arbitrary domain \Omega of \mathbb R^d. A Kato class of measures is defined to insure the closability of the associated form (\mem,\mfm). Moreover, the associated operator \Delta_{\mu} is a realization of the Laplacian on L^2(\Omega). In particular, when |\mu| is locally infinite everywhere on \po, \Delta_{\mu} is the laplacian with Dirichlet boundary conditions. On the other hand, we will prove that he semigroup (\emu)_{t\geq 0} is sandwitched between (\emup)_{t\geq 0} and (\emun)_{t\geq 0} and we will see that the converse is also true.
