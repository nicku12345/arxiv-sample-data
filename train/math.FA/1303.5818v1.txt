Let X,Y be Banach spaces, A:X \longrightarrow Y and B,C:Y \longrightarrow X be bounded linear operators satisfying operator equation ABA=ACA. Recently, as extensions of Jacobson's lemma, Corach, Duggal and Harte studied common properties of AC-I and BA-I in algebraic viewpoint and also obtained some topological analogues. In this note, we continue to investigate common properties of AC and BA from the viewpoint of spectral theory. In particular, we give an affirmative answer to one question posed by Corach et al. by proving that AC - I has closed range if and only if BA - I has closed range.
