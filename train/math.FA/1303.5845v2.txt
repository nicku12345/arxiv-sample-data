Decay rates for the sequence of eigenvalues of positive and compact integral operators has been largely investigated for a long time in the literature. In this paper, the focus will be on positive integral operators acting on square integrable functions on the unit sphere and generated by a kernel satisfying a H\"older type assumption defined via average operators. In the approach to be presented here, the decay rates will be reached from convenient estimations on the eigenvalues of the operator themselves, with the help of specific properties of a generic approximation operator defined through the so-called generalized Jackson kernels. The decay rates have the same structure of those known to hold in the cases in which the H\"older condition is the classical one. Therefore, within the spherical setting, the abstract approach to be introduced here extends some classical results on the topic.
