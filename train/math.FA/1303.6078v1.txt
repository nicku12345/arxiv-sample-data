In this paper we show that the Bishop-Phelps-Bollob\'as theorem holds for \mathcal{L}(L_1(\mu), L_1(\nu)) for all measures \mu and \nu and also holds for \mathcal{L}(L_1(\mu),L_\infty(\nu)) for every arbitrary measure \mu and every localizable measure \nu. Finally, we show that the Bishop-Phelps-Bollob\'as theorem holds for two classes of bounded linear operators from a real L_1(\mu) into a real C(K) if \mu is a finite measure and K is a compact Hausdorff space. In particular, one of the classes includes all Bochner representable operators and all weakly compact operators.
