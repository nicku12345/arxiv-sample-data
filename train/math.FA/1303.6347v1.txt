Recent results of A. Lerner concerning certain properties of the Fefferman-Stein maximal function are applied to show that (\BMO, X)_\theta = X^\theta, 0 < \theta < 1, for a Banach lattice X of measurable functions on \mathbb R^n satisfying the Fatou property such that X has order continuous norm and the Hardy-Littlewood maximal operator M is bounded in (X^\alpha)' for some 0 < \alpha \leqslant 1.
