Let \gamma be a Gaussian measure on a locally convex space and H be the corresponding Cameron-Martin space. It has been recently shown by L. Ambrosio and A. Figalli that the linear first-order PDE  \dot{\rho} + \mbox{div}_{\gamma} (\rho \cdot {b}) =0, \ \ \rho|_{t=0} = \rho_0,  where \rho_0 \cdot \gamma  is a probability measure, admits a weak solution, in particular, under the following assumptions:  \|b\|_{H} \in L^p(\gamma), \ p>1, \ \ \ \exp\bigl(\varepsilon(\mbox{\rm div}_{\gamma} b)_{-} \bigr) \in L^1(\gamma).  Applying transportation of measures via triangular maps we prove a similar result for a large class of non-Gaussian probability measures \nu on \R^{\infty}, under the main assumption that \beta_i \in \cap_{n \in \Nat} L^{n}(\nu) for every i \in \Nat, where \beta_i is the logarithmic derivative of \nu along the coordinate x_i.   We also show uniqueness of the solution for a wide class of measures. This class includes uniformly log-concave Gibbs measures and certain product measures. measures.
