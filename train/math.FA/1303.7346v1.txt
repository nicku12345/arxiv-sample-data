In this paper we give sharp extensions of convoluted solutions of wave equations in abstract Banach spaces. The main technique is to use the algebraic structure, for convolution products \ast and \ast_c, of these solutions which are defined by a version of the Duhamel's formula. We define algebra homomorphisms, for the convolution product \ast_c, from a certain set of test-functions and apply our results to concrete examples of abstract wave equations.
