A KMS matrix is one of the form J_n(a)=[{array}{ccccc} 0 & a & a^2 &... & a^{n-1} & 0 & a & \ddots & \vdots & & \ddots & \ddots & a^2 & & & \ddots & a 0 & & & & 0{array}] for n\ge 1 and a in \mathbb{C}. Among other things, we prove the following properties of its numerical range: (1) W(J_n(a)) is a circular disc if and only if n=2 and a\neq 0, (2) its boundary \partial W(J_n(a)) contains a line segment if and only if n\ge 3 and |a|=1, and (3) the intersection of the boundaries \partial W(J_n(a)) and \partial W(J_n(a)[j]) is either the singleton \{\min\sigma(\re J_n(a))\} if n is odd, j=(n+1)/2 and |a|>1, or the empty set \emptyset if otherwise, where, for any n-by-n matrix A, A[j] denotes its jth principal submatrix obtained by deleting its jth row and jth column (1\le j\le n), \re A its real part (A+A^*)/2, and \sigma(A) its spectrum.
