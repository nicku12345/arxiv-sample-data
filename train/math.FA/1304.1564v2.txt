We say that a submodule \cls of H^2(\mathbb{D}^n) (n >1) is co-doubly commuting if the quotient module H^2(\mathbb{D}^n)/\cls is doubly commuting. We show that a co-doubly commuting submodule of H^2(\mathbb{D}^n) is essentially doubly commuting if and only if the corresponding one variable inner functions are finite Blaschke products or that n = 2. In particular, a co-doubly commuting submodule \cls of H^2(\mathbb{D}^n) is essentially doubly commuting if and only if n = 2 or that \cls is of finite co-dimension. We obtain an explicit representation of the Beurling-Lax-Halmos inner functions for those submodules of H^2_{H^2(\mathbb{D}^{n-1})}(\mathbb{D}) which are co-doubly commuting submodules of H^2(\mathbb{D}^n). Finally, we prove that a pair of co-doubly commuting submodules of H^2(\mathbb{D}^n) are unitarily equivalent if and only if they are equal.
