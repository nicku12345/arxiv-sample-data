For \beta>0 and p\ge 1, the generalized Ces\`aro operator  \mathcal{C}_\beta f(t):=\frac{\beta}{t^\beta}\int_0^t (t-s)^{\beta-1}f(s)ds  and its companion operator \mathcal{C}_\beta^* defined on Sobolev spaces \mathcal{T}_p^{(\alpha)}(t^\alpha) and \mathcal{T}_p^{(\alpha)}(| t|^\alpha) (where \alpha\ge 0 is the fractional order of derivation and are embedded in L^p(\RR^+) and L^p(\RR) respectively) are studied. We prove that if p>1, then \mathcal{C}_\beta and \mathcal{C}_\beta^* are bounded operators and commute on \mathcal{T}_p^{(\alpha)}(t^\alpha) and \mathcal{T}_p^{(\alpha)}(| t|^\alpha). We show explicitly the spectra \sigma (\mathcal{C}_\beta) and \sigma (\mathcal{C}_\beta^*) and its operator norms (which depend on p). For 1< p\le 2, we prove that  \hat{{\mathcal C}_\beta(f)}={\mathcal C}_\beta^*(\hat{f}) and \hat{{\mathcal C}_\beta^*(f)}={\mathcal C}_\beta(\hat{f}) where \hat{f} is the Fourier transform of a function f\in L^p(\RR).
