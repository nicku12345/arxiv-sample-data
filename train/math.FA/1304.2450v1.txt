A definition of frames in Krein spaces is stated and a complete characterization is given by comparing them to frames in the associated Hilbert space. The basic tools of frame theory are described in the formalism of Krein spaces. It is shown how to transfer a frame for Hilbert spaces to Krein spaces given by a W-metric, where the Gram operator W is not necessarily regular and possibly unbounded.
