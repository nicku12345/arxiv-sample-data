In this paper, we establish various inequalities for some differentiable mappings that are linked with the illustrious Hermite-Hadamard integral inequality for mappings whose derivatives are s-(\alpha,m)-convex.The generalised integral inequalities contribute some better estimates than some already presented. The inequalities are then applied to numerical integration and some special means.
