In this paper, we establish various inequalities for some differentiable mappings that are linked with the illustrious Hermite- Hadamard integral inequality for mappings whose derivatives are (h -(\alpha?;m))-convex.The generalized integral inequalities contribute some better estimates than some already presented. The inequalities are then applied to numerical integration and some special means.
