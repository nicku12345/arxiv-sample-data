The Coifman-Fefferman inequality implies quite easily that a Calderon-Zygmund operator T acts boundedly in a Banach lattice X on \mathbb R^n if the Hardy-Littlewood maximal operator M is bounded in both X and X'. We discuss this phenomenon in some detail and establish a converse result under the assumption that X is p-convex and q-concave with some 1 < p, q < \infty and satisfies the Fatou property: if a linear operator T is bounded in X and T is nondegenerate in a certain sense (for example, if T is a Riesz transform) then M has to be bounded in both X and X'.
