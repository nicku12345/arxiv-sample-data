Using techniques of non-abelian harmonic analysis, we construct an explicit, non-zero cyclic derivation on the Fourier algebra of the real ax+b group. In particular this provides the first proof that this algebra is not weakly amenable. Using the structure theory of Lie groups, we deduce that the Fourier algebras of connected, semisimple Lie groups also support non-zero, cyclic derivations and are likewise not weakly amenable. Our results complement earlier work of Johnson (JLMS, 1994), Plymen (unpublished note) and Forrest--Samei--Spronk (IUMJ 2009). As an additional illustration of our techniques, we construct an explicit, non-zero cyclic derivation on the Fourier algebra of the reduced Heisenberg group, providing the first example of a connected nilpotent group whose Fourier algebra is not weakly amenable.
