It is shown that under certain stability conditions a complemented subspace of the space s of rapidly decreasing sequences is isomorphic to s and this condition characterizes s. This result is used to show that for the classical Cantor set X the space C_\infty(X) of restrictions to X of C^\infty-functions on \R is isomorphic to s, so completing the theory developed in "Restriction spaces of A^\infty", to appear in Rev.
