We study the unknown differences between the size of slices and relatively weakly open subsets of the unit ball in Banach spaces. We show that every Banach space containing isomorphic copies of c_0 can be equivalently renormed so that every slice of its unit ball has diameter 2 and satisfying that its unit ball contains nonempty relatively weakly open subsets with diameter arbitrarily small, which answers an open problem and stresses the differences of diameter between slices and relatively weakly open subsets of the unit ball in Banach spaces.
