Denote by [0,\omega_1) the set of countable ordinals, equipped with the order topology, let L_0 be the disjoint union of the compact ordinal intervals [0,\alpha] for \alpha countable, and consider the Banach spaces C_0[0,\omega_1) and C_0(L_0) consisting of all scalar-valued, continuous functions which are defined on the locally compact Hausdorff spaces [0,\omega_1) and L_0, respectively, and which vanish eventually. Our main result states that a bounded operator T between any pair of these two Banach spaces fixes a copy of C_0(L_0) if and only if the identity operator on C_0(L_0) factors through T, if and only if the Szlenk index of T is uncountable. This implies that the set \mathscr{S}_{C_0(L_0)}(C_0(L_0)) of C_0(L_0)-strictly singular operators on C_0(L_0) is the unique maximal ideal of the Banach algebra \mathscr{B}(C_0(L_0)) of all bounded operators on C_0(L_0), and that \mathscr{S}_{C_0(L_0)}(C_0[0,\omega_1)) is the second-largest proper ideal of \mathscr{B}(C_0[0,\omega_1)). Moreover, it follows that the Banach space C_0(L_0) is primary and complementably homogeneous.
