The Bohr-Bohnenblust-Hille Theorem states that the width of the strip in the complex plane on which an ordinary Dirichlet series \sum_n a_n n^{-s} converges uniformly but not absolutely is less than or equal to 1/2, and this estimate is optimal. Equivalently, the supremum of the absolute convergence abscissas of all Dirichlet series in the Hardy space \mathcal{H}_\infty equals 1/2. By a surprising fact of Bayart the same result holds true if \mathcal{H}_\infty is replaced by any Hardy space \mathcal{H}_p, 1 \le p < \infty, of Dirichlet series. For Dirichlet series with coefficients in a Banach space X the maximal width of Bohr's strips depend on the geometry of X; Defant, Garc\'ia, Maestre and P\'erez-Garc\'ia proved that such maximal width equal 1- 1/\ct(X), where \ct(X) denotes the maximal cotype of X. Equivalently, the supremum over the absolute convergence abscissas of all Dirichlet series in the vector-valued Hardy space \mathcal{H}_\infty(X) equals 1- 1/\ct(X). In this article we show that this result remains true if \mathcal{H}_\infty(X) is replaced by the larger class \mathcal{H}_p(X), 1 \le p < \infty.
