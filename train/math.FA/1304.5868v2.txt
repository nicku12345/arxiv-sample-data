Let {\cal{M}} be a complete Riemannian manifold with Ricci curvature bounded below and Laplace operator \Delta. The paper develops a functional calculus for the cosine family \cos(t\sqrt {\Delta}) which is associated with waves that travel at unit speed. If f is holomorphic on a Venturi shaped region, and z^kf(z) is bounded for some positive integer k, then f({\sqrt \Delta}) defines a bounded linear operator on L^p({\cal{M}}) for some p>2. For Jacobi hypergroups with invariant measure m the generalized Fourier transform of f\in L^1(m) gives \hat f\in H^\infty (\Sigma_\omega) for some strip \Sigma_\omega. Hence one defines \hat f(A) for operators A in some Banach space that have a H^\infty (\Sigma_\omega) functional calculus. The paper introduces an operational calculus for the Mehler--Fock transform of order zero. By transference methods, one defines \hat f(A) when \hat f is a s-Marcinkiewicz multiplier and e^{itA} is a strongly continuous operator group on a L^p space for | 1/2-1/p| <1/s.\par
