Using a strengthening of the concept of \K set, introduced in this paper, we study a certain subclass of the class of \K Banach spaces; the so called strongly \K Banach spaces. This class of spaces includes subspaces of strongly weakly compactly generated (SWCG) as well as Polish Banach spaces and it is related to strongly weakly \mathcal{K}--analytic (SWKA) Banach spaces as the known classes of \K and weakly \mathcal{K}--analytic (WKA) Banach spaces are related.
