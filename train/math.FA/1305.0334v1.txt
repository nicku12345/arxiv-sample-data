Reconstruction property in Banach spaces introduced and studied by Casazza and Christensen in [1]. In this paper we introduce reconstruction property in Banach spaces which satisfy \mathfrak{I}-property. A characterization of reconstruction property in Banach spaces which satisfy \mathfrak{I}-property in terms of frames in Banach spaces is obtained. Banach frames associated with reconstruction property are discussed.
