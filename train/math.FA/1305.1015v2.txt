We consider the conditions under which the Cayley transform of the Kronecker product of two Hermitian matrices can be again presented as a Kronecker product of two matrices and, if so, if it is a product of the Cayley transforms of the two Hermitian matrices. We also study the related question: given two matrices, which matrix under the Cayley transform yields the Kronecker product of their Cayley transforms.
