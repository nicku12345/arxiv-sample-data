We prove the existence of a simultaneous projectional skeleton for certain subspaces of \mathcal{C}(K) spaces. This generalizes a result on simultaneous projectional resolutions of identity proved by M. Valdivia. We collect some consequences of this result. In particular we give a new characterization of Asplund spaces using the notion of projectional skeleton.
