We solve several problems on frequently hypercyclic operators. Firstly, we characterize frequently hypercyclic weighted shifts on \ell^p(\mathbb Z), p\geq 1. Our method uses properties of the difference set of a set with positive upper density. Secondly, we show that there exists an operator which is \mathcal U-frequently hypercyclic, yet not frequently hypercyclic and that there exists an operator which is frequently hypercyclic, yet not distributionally chaotic. These (surprizing) counterexamples are given by weighted shifts on c_0. The construction of these shifts lies on the construction of sets of positive integers whose difference sets have very specific properties.
