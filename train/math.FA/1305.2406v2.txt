We study the (two-parameter) Segal--Bargmann transform \mathbf{B}_{s,t}^N on the unitary group \mathbb{U}_N, for large N. Acting on matrix valued functions that are equivariant under the adjoint action of the group, the transform has a meaningful limit \mathscr{G}_{s,t} as N\to\infty, which can be identified as an operator on the space of complex Laurent polynomials. We introduce the space of {\em trace polynomials}, and use it to give effective computational methods to determine the action of the heat operator, and thus the Segal--Bargmann transform. We prove several concentration of measure and limit theorems, giving a direct connection from the finite-dimensional transform \mathbf{B}_{s,t}^N to its limit \mathscr{G}_{s,t}. We characterize the operator \mathscr{G}_{s,t} through its inverse action on the standard polynomial basis. Finally, we show that, in the case s=t, the limit transform \mathscr{G}_{t,t} is the ``free Hall transform'' \mathscr{G}^t introduced by Biane.
