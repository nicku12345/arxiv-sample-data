We introduce the concept of an E-valued function algebra, a type of Banach algebra that consist of continuous E-valued functions on some compact Hausdorff space, where E is a Banach algebra. We present some basic results about such algebras, having to do with the Shilov boundary and the set of peak points of some commutative E-valued function algebras. We give some specific examples.
