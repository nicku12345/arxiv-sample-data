In this paper we investigate the continuity of \mathbb{Q}_+-homogeneous superadditive correspondences defined on the cones with finite basis in real topological vector spaces. It is also shown that every lower semicontinuous and \mathbb{Q}_+-homogeneous superadditive correspondence between two cones with finite basis admits a family of continuous linear selections.
