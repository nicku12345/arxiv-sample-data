Given a homogeneous k-th order differential operator A (D) on \mathbb{R}^n between two finite dimensional spaces, we establish the Hardy inequality \int_{\mathbb{R}^n} \frac{\lvert D^{k-1}u\rvert}{\lvert x \rvert} \,\mathrm{d} x \leq C \int_{\mathbb{R}^n} \lvert A(D)u\rvert  and the Sobolev inequality \lVert D^{k-n} u\rVert_{L^{\infty}(\mathbb{R}^n)}\leq C \int_{\mathbb{R}^n} \lvert A(D)u\rvert  when A(D) is elliptic and satisfies a recently introduced cancellation property. We also study the necessity of these two conditions.
