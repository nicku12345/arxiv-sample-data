Let (E,\mathcal F,\mu) be a probability space, and let P be a Markov operator on L^2(\mu) with 1 a simple eigenvalue such that \mu P=\mu (i.e. \mu is an invariant probability measure of P). Then \hat P:=\ff 1 2 (P+P^*) has a spectral gap, i.e. 1 is isolated in the spectrum of \hat P, if and only if \|P\|_\tau:=\lim_{R\to\infty} \sup_{\mu(f^2)\le 1}\mu\big(f(Pf-R)^+\big)<1. This strengthens a conjecture of Simon and H\phiegh-Krohn on the spectral gap for hyperbounded operators solved recently by L. Miclo in \cite{M}. Consequently, for a symmetric, conservative, irreducible Dirichlet form on L^2(\mu), a Poincar\'e/log-Sobolev type inequality holds if and only if so does the corresponding defective inequality. Extensions to sub-Markov operators and non-conservative Dirichlet forms are also presented.
