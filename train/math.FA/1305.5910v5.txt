Symplectic self-adjointness of Hamiltonian operator matrices is studied, which arises in symplectic elasticity and optimal control. For the cases of diagonal domain and off-diagonal domain, necessary and sufficient conditions are shown. The proofs use Frobenius-Schur fractorizations of unbounded operator matrices. Under additional assumptions, sufficient conditions based on perturbation method are obtained. The theory is applied to a problem in symplectic elasticity.
