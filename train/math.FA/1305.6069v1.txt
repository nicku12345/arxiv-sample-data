For a measure space (\Omega ,\Sigma ,\mu) and a bijective increasing function \varphi :\left[ 0,\infty \right) \rightarrow \left[0,\infty \right) the L^{p}-like paranormed (F-normed) function space with the paranorm of the form \mathbf{p}_{\varphi}(x)=\varphi ^{-1}\left(\int_{\Omega}\varphi \circ \left|x\right|d\mu \right) is considered. Main results give general conditions under which this space is uniformly convex. The Clarkson theorem on the uniform convexity of L^{p}-space is generalized. Under some specific assumptions imposed on \varphi we give not only a proof of the uniform convexity but also show the formula of a modulus of convexity. We establish the uniform convexity of all finite-dimensional paranormed spaces, generated by a strictly convex bijection \varphi of [0, \infty). However, the {\it a contrario} proof of this fact provides no information on a modulus of convexity of these spaces. In some cases it can be done, even an exact formula of a modulus can be proved. We show how to make it in the case when S={\mathbb R}^2 and \varphi is given by \varphi(t)={\rm e}^t-1.
