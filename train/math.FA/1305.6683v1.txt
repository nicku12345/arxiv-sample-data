In this paper, we discuss the boundedness of the fractional type Marcinkiewicz integral operators associated to surfaces, and extend a result given by Chen, Fan and Ying in 2002. They showed that under certain conditions the fractional type Marcinkiewicz integral operators are bounded from the Triebel-Lizorkin spaces \dot F_{pq}^{\alpha}({\mathbb R}^n) to L^p({\mathbb R}^n). Recently the second author, together with Xue and Yan, greatly weakened their assumptions. In this paper, we extend their results to the case where the operators are associated to the surfaces of the form \{x=\phi(|y|)y/|y|\} \subset {\mathbb R}^n \times ({\mathbb R}^n \setminus \{0\}).   To prove our result, we discuss a characterization of the homogeneous Triebel-Lizorkin spaces in terms of lacunary sequences.
