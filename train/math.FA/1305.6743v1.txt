Pick spaces are a class of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces that generalize the classical Hardy space and the Drury--Arveson reproducing kernel spaces. We give characterizations of certain contractively included subspaces of Pick spaces. These generalize the characterization of closed invariant subspaces of Trent and McCullough, as well as results for the Drury--Arveson space obtained by Ball, Bolotnikov and Fang.
