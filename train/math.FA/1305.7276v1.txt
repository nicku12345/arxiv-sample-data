We present an abstract result that characterizes the coincidence of certain classes of linear operators with the class of Cohen strongly summing linear operators. Our argument is extended to multilinear operators and, as a consequence, we establish a few alternative characterizations for the class of Cohen strongly summing multilinear operators.
