In this work, we present a bilinear Tb theorem for singular integral operators of Calder\'on-Zygmund type. We prove some new accretive type Littlewood-Paley theory and bilinear paraproduct for a para-accretive function setting. We also introduce a criterion for extending certain Lp Clader\'on reproducing formulas to convergence in H1.
