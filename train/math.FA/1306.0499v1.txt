Given Banach spaces \X and \Y and Banach space operators A\in L(\X) and B\in L(\Y), let \rho\colon L(\Y,\X)\to L(\Y,\X) denote the generalized derivation defined by A and B, i.e., \rho (U)=AU-UB (U\in L(\Y,\X)). The main objective of this article is to study Weyl and Browder type theorems for \rho\in L(L(\Y,\X)). To this end, however, first the isolated points of the spectrum and the Drazin spectrum of \rho\in L(L(\Y,\X)) need to be characterized. In addition, it will be also proved that if A and B are polaroid (respectively isoloid), then \rho is polaroid (respectively isoloid).
