Let G be a locally compact abelian topological group. For locally bounded measurable functions \varphi: G\to\Bbb {C} we discuss notions of spectra for \varphi relative to subalgebras of L^{1}(G). In particular we study polynomials on G and determine their spectra. We also characterize the primary ideals of certain Beurling algebras L_{w}^{1}(\Bbb Z) on the group of integers \Bbb Z. This allows us to classify those elements of L_{w}^{1}(G) that have finite spectrum. If \varphi is a uniformly continuous function whose differences are bounded, there is a Beurling algebra naturally associated with \varphi. We give a condition on the spectrum of \varphi relative to this algebra which ensures that \varphi is bounded. Finally we give spectral conditions on a bounded function on \Bbb R that ensure that its indefinite integral is bounded.
