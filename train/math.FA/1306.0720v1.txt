Maximality of a contractive tuple of operators is considered. Characterization of a contractive tuple to be maximal is obtained. Notion of maximality of a submodule of Drury-Arveson module on the d-dimensional unit ball \mathbb{B}_d is defined. For d=1, it is shown that every submodule of the Hardy module over the unit disc is maximal. But for d\ge 2 we prove that any homogeneous submodule or submodule generated by polynomials is not maximal. A characterization of a submodule to be maximal is obtained.
