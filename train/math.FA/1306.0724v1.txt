Doubly commutativity of invariant subspaces of the Bergman space and the Dirichlet space over the unit polydisc \mathbb{D}^n (with  n \geq 2) is investigated. We show that for any non-empty subset \alpha=\{\alpha_1,\dots,\alpha_k\} of \{1,\dots,n\} and doubly commuting invariant subspace \s of the Bergman space or the Dirichlet space over \D^n, the tuple consists of restrictions of co-ordinate multiplication operators M_{\alpha}|_\s:=(M_{z_{\alpha_1}}|_\s,\dots, M_{z_{\alpha_k}}|_\s) always possesses wandering subspace of the form \[\bigcap_{i=1}^k(\s\ominus z_{\alpha_i}\s). \]
