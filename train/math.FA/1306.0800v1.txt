Generalized \mathbf{m}-Gelfand-Shilov-Roumieu vector spaces \mathcal{S}_{\mathbf{m}}(\mathbf{X}) are introduced. Here \mathbf{m} = (m^{(1)},...,m^{(n)}), \mathbf{X}=(X_{1},...,X_{n}) and m^{(1)},...,m^{(n)} are sequences of positive real numbers and X_{1},...,X_{n} are operators in a Hilbert space. Conditions are given on the sequences m^{(1)},...,m^{(n)} and on the operators X_{1},...,X_{n} so that the equality S_{\mathbf{m}}(\mathbf{X}) = S_{m^{(1)}}(X_{1})\cap ... \cap{S}_{m^{(n)}}(X_{n}) is valid. As a corollary we obtain a new proof of a characterization theorem for classical Gelfand-Shilov spaces.
