We analyze Fourier hyperfunction and hyperfunction semigroups with non-densely defined generators and their connections with local convoluted C-semigroups. Structural theorems and spectral characterizations give necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of such semigroups generated by a closed not necessarily densely defined operator A.
