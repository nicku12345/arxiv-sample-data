We show examples of compact linear operators between Banach spaces which cannot be approximated by norm attaining operators. This is the negative answer to an open question posed in the 1970's. Actually, any strictly convex Banach space failing the approximation property serves as the range space. On the other hand, there are examples in which the domain space has a Schauder basis.
