We characterize functions of finite energy in the plane in terms of their traces on the lines that make up "graph paper" with squares of side length mn for all n, and certain \12-order Sobolev norms on the graph paper lines. We also obtain analogous results for functions of finite energy on two classical fractals: the Sierpinski gasket and the Sierpinski carpet.
