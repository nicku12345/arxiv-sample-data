For n-by-n and m-by-m complex matrices A and B, it is known that the inequality w(A\otimes B)\le\|A\|w(B) holds, where w(\cdot) and \|\cdot\| denote, respectively, the numerical radius and the operator norm of a matrix. In this paper, we consider when this becomes an equality. We show that (1) if \|A\|=1 and w(A\otimes B)=w(B), then either A has a unitary part or A is completely nonunitary and the numerical range W(B) of B is a circular disc centered at the origin, (2) if \|A\|=\|A^k\|=1 for some k, 1\le k<\infty, then w(A)\ge\cos(\pi/(k+2)), and, moreover, the equality holds if and only if A is unitarily similar to the direct sum of the (k+1)-by-(k+1) Jordan block J_{k+1} and a matrix B with w(B)\le\cos(\pi/(k+2)), and (3) if B is a nonnegative matrix with its real part (permutationally) irreducible, then w(A\otimes B)=\|A\|w(B) if and only if either p_A=\infty or n_B\le p_A<\infty and B is permutationally similar to a block-shift matrix \[[   {array}{cccc}   0 & B_1 & &   & 0 & \ddots &   & & \ddots & B_k   & & & 0   {array}   ]\] with k=n_B, where p_A=\sup\{\ell\ge 1: \|A^{\ell}\|=\|A\|^{\ell}\} and n_B=\sup\{\ell\ge 1 : B^{\ell}\neq 0\}.
