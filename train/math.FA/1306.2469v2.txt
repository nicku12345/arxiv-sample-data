A function f defined on a 2-normed space  (X,||.,.||) is ward continuous if it preserves quasi-Cauchy sequences where a sequence (x_n) of points in X is called quasi-Cauchy if lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}||\Delta x_{n},z||=0 for every z\in X. Some other kinds of continuties are also introduced via quasi-Cauchy sequences in 2-normed spaces. It turns out that uniform limit of ward continuous functions is again ward continuous.
