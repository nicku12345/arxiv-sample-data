A net (x_\alpha)_{\alpha\in \Gamma} in a vector lattice X is unbounded order convergent (uo-convergent) to x if |x_\alpha-x| \wedge y \xrightarrow{o} 0 for each y \in X_+, and is unbounded order Cauchy (uo-Cauchy) if the net (x_\alpha-x_{\alpha'})_{\Gamma\times \Gamma} is uo-convergent to 0. In the first part of this article, we study uo-convergent and uo-Cauchy nets in Banach lattices and use them to characterize Banach lattices with the positive Schur property and KB-spaces. In the second part, we use the concept of uo-Cauchy sequences to extend Doob's submartingale convergence theorems to a measure-free setting. Our results imply, in particular, that every norm bounded submartingale in L_1(\Omega;F) is almost surely uo-Cauchy in F, where F is an order continuous Banach lattice with a weak unit.
