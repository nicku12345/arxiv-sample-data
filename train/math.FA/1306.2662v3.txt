Following Sarason's classification of the densely defined multiplication operators over the Hardy space, we classify the densely defined multipliers over the Sobolev space, W^{1,2}[0,1]. In this paper we find that the collection of such multipliers for the Sobolev space is exactly the Sobolev space itself. This sharpens a result of Shields concerning bounded multipliers. The densely defined multiplication operators over the subspace W_0 = \{f \in W^{1,2}[0,1] : f(0)=f(1)=0 \} are also classified. In this case the densely defined multiplication operators can be written as a ratio of functions in W_0 where the denominator is non-vanishing. This is proved using a contructive argument.
