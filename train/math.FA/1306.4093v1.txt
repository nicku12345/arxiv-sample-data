EP Banach space operators and EP Banach algebra elements are characterized using different kinds of factorizations. The results obtained generalize well-known characterizations of EP matrices, EP Hilbert space operators and EP C^*-algebra elements. Furthermore, new results that hold in these contexts are presented.
