We study notions of absolute continuity for functions defined on \mathbb{R}^nsimilar to the notion of \alpha-absolute continuity in the sense of Bongiorno. We confirm a conjecture of Mal\'y that 1-absolutely continuous functions do not need to be differentiable a.e., and we show several other pathological examples of functions in this class. We establish containment relations of the class 1-AC_{\rm WDN} which consits of all functions in 1-AC which are in the Sobolev space W^{1,2}_{loc}, are differentiable a.e. and satisfy the Luzin (N) property, with previously studied classes of absolutely continuous functions.
