In this article, we prove that a complex cone is a set of injectivity for the twisted spherical means for the class of all continuous functions on \mathbb C^n as long as it does not completely lay on the level surface of any bi-graded homogeneous harmonic polynomial on \mathbb C^n. Further, we produce examples of such level surfaces.
