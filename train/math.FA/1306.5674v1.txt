In this paper we study the preservation of strong stability of strongly continuous semigroups on Hilbert spaces. In particular, we study a situation where the generator of the semigroup has a finite number of spectral points on the imaginary axis and the norm of its resolvent operator is polynomially bounded near these points. We characterize classes of finite rank perturbations preserving the strong stability of the semigroup. In addition, we improve recent results on preservation of polynomial stability of a semigroup under finite rank perturbations of its generator. Theoretic results are illustrated with an example where we consider the preservation of the strong stability of a multiplication semigroup.
