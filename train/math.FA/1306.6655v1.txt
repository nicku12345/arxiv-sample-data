For every bivariate polynomial p(z_1, z_2) of bidegree (n_1, n_2), with p(0,0)=1, which has no zeros in the open unit bidisk, we construct a determinantal representation of the form p(z_1,z_2)=\det (I - K Z), where Z is an (n_1+n_2)\times(n_1+n_2) diagonal matrix with coordinate variables z_1, z_2 on the diagonal and K is a contraction. We show that K may be chosen to be unitary if and only if p is a (unimodular) constant multiple of its reverse.   Furthermore, for every bivariate real-zero polynomial p(x_1, x_2), with p(0,0)=1, we provide a construction to build a representation of the form p(x_1,x_2)=\det (I+x_1A_1+x_2A_2), where A_1 and A_2 are Hermitian matrices of size equal to the degree of p.   A key component of both constructions is a stable factorization of a positive semidefinite matrix-valued polynomial in one variable, either on the circle (trigonometric polynomial) or on the real line (algebraic polynomial).
