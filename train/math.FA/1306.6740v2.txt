We show that the space of bounded and linear operators between spaces of continuous functions on compact Hausdorff topological spaces has the Bishop-Phelps-Bollob\'as property. A similar result is also proved for the class of compact operators from the space of continuous functions vanishing at infinity on a locally compact and Hausdorff topological space into a uniformly convex space, and for the class of compact operators from a Banach space into a predual of an L_1-space.
