Let (E_0,E_1) and (H_0,H_1) be a pair of Banach spaces with dense and continuous embeddings E_1 into E_0, H_1 into H_0. For \theta \in [0,1] denote by B_\theta(0,R) the ball of radius R centered at zero in the interpolation spaces E_\theta. Assume that an analytic map \Phi maps the ball B_0(0,R) into H_0, \Phi maps B_1(0,R) into H_1 and for \theta =0,1 the estimates  \|\Phi(x)\|_{H_\theta} \le C_\theta\|x\|_{H_\theta}, \forall\ x\in B_\theta(0,R),  hold. Then for all \theta\in(0, 1) and r<R \Phi maps the ball B_\theta (0,r) into H_\theta and the same estimate holds for x\in B_\theta(0,r) if the constant C_\theta is replaced by C_0^{1-\theta}C_1^\theta R/(R-r).
