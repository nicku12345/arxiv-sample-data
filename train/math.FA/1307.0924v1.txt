Let G be a bounded open subset in the complex plane and let H^{2}(G) denote the Hardy space on G. We call a bounded simply connected domain W perfectly connected if the boundary value function of the inverse of the Riemann map from W onto the unit disk D is almost 1-1 rwith respect to the Lebesgure on \partial D and if the Riemann map belongs to the weak-star closure of the polynomials in H^{\infty}(W). Our main theorem states: In order that for each M\in Lat(M_{z}), there exist u\in H^{\infty}(G) such that  M = \vee\{u H^{2}(G)\}, it is necessary and sufficient that the following hold:   1) Each component of G is a perfectly connected domain.   2) The harmonic measures of the components of G are mutually singular.   3) % P^{\infty}(\omega)   The set of polynomials is weak-star dense in  H^{\infty}(G).   \noindent Moreover, if G satisfies these conditions, then every M\in Lat(M_{z}) is of the form u H^{2}(G), where %u\in H^{\infty}(G) and the restriction of u to each of the components of G is either an inner function or zero.
