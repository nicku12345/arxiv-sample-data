By adapting the mass transportation technique of Cordero-Erausquin, Nazaret and Villani, we obtain a family of sharp Sobolev and Gagliardo-Nirenberg (GN) inequalities on the half space \mathbf{R}^{n-1}\times\mathbf{R}_+, n\geq 1 equipped with the weight \omega(x) = x_n^a, a\geq 0. It amounts to work with the fractional dimension n_a = n+a. The extremal functions in the weighted Sobolev inequalities are fully characterized. Using a dimension reduction argument and the weighted Sobolev inequalities, we can reproduce a subfamily of the sharp GN inequalities on the Euclidean space due to Del Pino and Dolbeault, and obtain some new sharp GN inequalities as well. Our weighted inequalities are also extended to the domain \mathbf{R}^{n-m}\times \mathbf{R}^m_+ and the weights are \omega(x,t) = t_1^{a_1}\dots t_m^{a_m}, where n\geq m, m\geq 0 and a_1,\cdots,a_m\geq 0. A weighted L^p-logarithmic Sobolev inequality is derived from these inequalities.
