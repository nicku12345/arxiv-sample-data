For every, possibly unbounded, multiplication operator in L^p-space, p\in ]0,\infty[, on finite separable measure space we show that multicyclicity, multi-*-cyclicity, and multiplicity coincide. This result includes and generalizes Bram's much cited theorem from 1955 on bounded *-cyclic normal operators. It also includes as a core result cyclicity of the multiplication operator M_z by the complex variable z in L^p(\mu) for every Borel measure \mu on \C. The concise proof is based in part on the result that the function e^{-|z|^2} is a *-cyclic vector for M_z in C_0(\C) and further in L^p(\mu). We characterize topologically those locally compact sets X\subset \C, for which M_z in C_0(X) is cyclic.
