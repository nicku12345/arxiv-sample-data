Let X be a sequence space and denote by Z(X) the subset of X formed by sequences having only a finite number of zero coordinates. We study algebraic properties of Z(X) and show (among other results) that (for p \in [1,\infty]) Z(\ell_p) does not contain infinite dimensional closed subspaces. This solves an open question originally posed by R. M. Aron and V. I. Gurariy in 2003 on the linear structure of Z(\ell_\infty).   In addition to this, we also give a thorough analysis of the existing algebraic structures within the set X \setminus Z(X) and its algebraic genericity.
