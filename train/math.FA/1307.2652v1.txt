Let K_\theta be a model space generated by an inner function \theta. We study the Schatten class membership of embeddings I : K_\theta \to L^2(\mu), \mu a positive measure, and of composition operators C_\phi:K_\theta\to H^2(\mathbb D) with a holomprphic function \phi:\mathbb D\rightarrow \mathbb D. In the case of one-component inner functions \theta we show that the problem can be reduced to the study of natural extensions of I and C_\phi to the Hardy-Smirnov space E^2(D) in some domain D\supset \mathbb D. In particular, we obtain a characterization of Schatten membership of C_\phi in terms of Nevanlinna counting function. By example this characterization does not hold true for general \phi.
