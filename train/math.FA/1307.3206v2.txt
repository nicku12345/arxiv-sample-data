In this paper we study how certain symmetries of convex bodies affect their geometric properties. In particular, we consider the impact of symmetries generated by the block diagonal subgroup of orthogonal transformations, generalizing complex and quaternionic convex bodies. We conduct a systematic study of sections of bodies with symmetries of this type, with the emphasis on problems of the Busemann-Petty type and hyperplane inequalities. The main role belongs to the class of intersection bodies with symmetries.
