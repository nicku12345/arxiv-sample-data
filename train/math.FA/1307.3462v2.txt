We give a sufficient condition for the sum of two closed operators to be closed. In particular, we study the sum of two sectorial operators with the sum of their sectoriality angles greater than \pi. We show that if one of the operators admits bounded H^{\infty}-calculus and the resolvent of the other operator satisfies a boundedness condition stronger than the standard sectoriality, but weaker than the bounded imaginary powers property in the case of UMD spaces, then the sum is closed. We apply the result to the abstract parabolic problem and give a sufficient condition for L^{p}-maximal regularity.
