We prove that the kernel of a quotient operator from an \mathcal L_1-space onto a Banach space X with the Bounded Approximation Property (BAP) has the BAP. This completes earlier results of Lusky --case \ell_1-- and Figiel, Johnson and Pe\l czy\'nski --case X^* separable. Given a Banach space X, we show that if the kernel of a quotient map from some \mathcal L_1-space onto X has the BAP then every kernel of every quotient map from any \mathcal L_1-space onto X has the BAP. The dual result for \mathcal L_\infty-spaces also hold: if for some \mathcal L_\infty-space E some quotient E/X has the BAP then for every \mathcal L_\infty-space E every quotient E/X has the BAP.
