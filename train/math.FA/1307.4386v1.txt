We continue the study of Uniformly Finitely Extensible Banach spaces (in short, UFO) initiated in Moreno-Plichko, \emph{On automorphic Banach spaces}, Israel J. Math. 169 (2009) 29--45 and Castillo-Plichko, \emph{Banach spaces in various positions.} J. Funct. Anal. 259 (2010) 2098-2138. We show that they have the Uniform Approximation Property of Pe\l czy\'nski and Rosenthal and are compactly extensible. We will also consider their connection with the automorphic space problem of Lindenstrauss and Rosenthal --do there exist automorphic spaces other than c_0(I) and \ell_2(I)?-- showing that a space all whose subspaces are UFO must be automorphic when it is Hereditarily Indecomposable (HI), and a Hilbert space when it is either locally minimal or isomorphic to its square. We will finally show that most HI --among them, the super-reflexive HI space constructed by Ferenczi-- and asymptotically \ell_2 spaces in the literature cannot be automorphic.
