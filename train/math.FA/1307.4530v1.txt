In connection to the Fuglede conjecture, we study groups of local translations associated to spectral sets, i.e., measurable sets in \br or \bz that have an orthogonal basis of exponential functions. We investigate the connections between the groups of local translations on \bz and on \br and present some examples for low cardinality. We present some relations between the group of local translations and tilings.
