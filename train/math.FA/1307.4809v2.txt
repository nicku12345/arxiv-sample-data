Grothendieck's theorem asserts that every continuous linear operator from \ell_{1} to \ell_{2} is absolutely \left( 1;1\right) -summing. In this note we prove that the optimal constant g_{m} so that every continuous m-linear operator from \ell_{1}\times\cdots\times\ell_{1} to \ell_{2} is absolutely \left( g_{m};1\right) -summing is \frac{2}{m+1}. We also show that if g_{m}<\frac{2}{m+1} there is \mathfrak{c} dimensional linear space composed by continuous non absolutely \left( g_{m};1\right) -summing m-linear operators from \ell_{1}\times\cdots\times\ell_{1} to \ell_{2}. In particular, our result solves (in the positive) a conjecture posed by A.T. Bernardino in 2011.
