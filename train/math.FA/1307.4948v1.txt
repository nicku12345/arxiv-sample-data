The generalized Young inequality on the Lorentz spaces for commutative hypergroups is introdused and an application of it is given to the theory of fractional integrals. The boundedness on the Lorentz space and the Hardy-Littlewood-Sobolev theorem for the fractional integrals on the commutative hypergroups is proved.
