By the Hardy-Littlewood-Sobolev theorem the classical Riesz potential is bounded on Lebesgue spaces. E. Nakai and H. Sumitomo [16] extended that theorem to the Orlicz spaces. We introduce generalized potential operators on commutative hypergroups and under some assumptions on the kernel we showed the boundedness of these operators from Lebesgue space into certain Orlicz space. Our result is an analogue of Theorem 1.3 in [16].
