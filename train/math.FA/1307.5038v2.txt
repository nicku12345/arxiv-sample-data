Let A \in M_n(\C). We consider the mapping f_A(x)=x^*Ax, defined on the unit sphere in \C^n. The map has a multi-valued inverse f_A^{-1}, and the continuity properties of f_A^{-1} are considered in terms of the structure of the set of pre-images for points in the numerical range. It is shown that there may be only finitely many failures of continuity of f_A^{-1}, and conditions for where these failure occur are given. Additionally, we give a necessary and sufficient condition for weak inverse continuity to hold for n=4 and a sufficient condition for n>4.
