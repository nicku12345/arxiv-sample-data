In this paper we consider the f-orthomorphisms and f-linear operators on the order dual of an f-algebra. In particular, when the f-algebra has the factorization property (not necessarily unital), we prove that the orthomorphisms, f-orthomorphisms and f-linear operators on the order dual are precisely the same class of operators.
