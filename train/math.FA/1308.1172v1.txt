In this work, various versions of the so-called Omega-Lemma are provided, which ensure differentiability properties of pushforwrds between spaces of C^r-sections (or compactly supported C^r-sections) in vector bundles over finite-dimensional base manifolds whose fibres are (possibly infinite-dimensional) locally convex spaces.   Applications are given, including the proof of continuity for some natural module multiplications on spaces of sections and the construction of certain infinite-dimensional Lie groups of Lie group-valued maps.
