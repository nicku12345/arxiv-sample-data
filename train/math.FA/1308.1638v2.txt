We study the existence of a retraction from the dual space X^* of a (real or complex) Banach space X onto its unit ball B_{X^*} which is uniformly continuous in norm topology and continuous in weak-* topology. Such a retraction is called a uniformly simultaneously continuous retraction.   It is shown that if X has a normalized unconditional Schauder basis with unconditional basis constant 1 and X^* is uniformly monotone, then a uniformly simultaneously continuous retraction from X^* onto B_{X^*} exists. It is also shown that if \{X_i\} is a family of separable Banach spaces whose duals are uniformly convex with moduli of convexity \delta_i(\varepsilon) such that \inf_i \delta_i(\varepsilon)>0 and X= \left[\bigoplus X_i\right]_{c_0} or X=\left[\bigoplus X_i\right]_{\ell_p} for 1\le p<\infty, then a uniformly simultaneously continuous retraction exists from X^* onto B_{X^*}.   The relation between the existence of a uniformly simultaneously continuous retraction and the Bishsop-Phelps-Bollob\'as property for operators is investigated and it is proved that the existence of a uniformly simultaneously continuous retraction from X^* onto its unit ball implies that a pair (X, C_0(K)) has the Bishop-Phelps-Bollob\'as property for every locally compact Hausdorff spaces K. As a corollary, we prove that (C_0(S), C_0(K)) has the Bishop-Phelps-Bollob\'as property if C_0(S) and C_0(K) are the spaces of all real-valued continuous functions vanishing at infinity on locally compact metric space S and locally compact Hausdorff space K respectively.
