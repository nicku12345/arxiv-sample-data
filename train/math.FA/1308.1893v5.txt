Let X be a symmetric space of the noncompact type. The goal of the paper is to construct in the space L_{2}(X) nearly Parseval frames consisting of functions which simultaneously belong to Paley-Wiener spaces and to Schwartz space on X. We call them Paley-Wiener-Schwartz frames in L_{2}(X). These frames are used to characterize a family of Besov spaces on X. As a part of our construction we develop on X the so-called average Shannon-type sampling.
