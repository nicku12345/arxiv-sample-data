The main concern of this note is the Moore-Penrose inverse in the context of Banach spaces and algebras. Especially attention will be given to a particular class of elements with the aforementioned inverse, namely EP Banach space operators and Banach algebra elements, which will be studied and characterized extending well-known results obtained in the frame of Hilbert space operators and C^*-algebra elements.
