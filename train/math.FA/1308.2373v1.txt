We prove various Hardy-type and uncertainty inequalities on a stratified Lie group G. In particular, we show that the operators T_\alpha: f \mapsto |.|^{-\alpha} L^{-\alpha/2} f, where |.| is a homogeneous norm, 0 < \alpha < Q/p, and L is the sub-Laplacian, are bounded on the Lebesgue space L^p(G). As consequences, we estimate the norms of these operators sufficiently precisely to be able to differentiate and prove a logarithmic uncertainty inequality. We also deduce a general version of the Heisenberg-Pauli-Weyl inequality, relating the L^p norm of a function f to the L^q norm of |.|^\beta f and the L^r norm of L^{\delta/2} f.
