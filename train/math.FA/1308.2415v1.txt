The classical Denjoy-Young-Saks theorem on Dini derivatives of arbitrary functions f: \R \to \R was extended by U.S. Haslam-Jones (1932) and A.J. Ward (1935) to arbitrary functions on \R^2. This extension gives the strongest relation among upper and lower Hadamard directional derivatives f^+_H (x,v), f^-_H (x,v) (v \in X) which holds almost everywhere for an arbitrary function f:\R^2\to \R. Our main result extends the theorem of Haslam-Jones and Ward to functions on separable Banach spaces.
