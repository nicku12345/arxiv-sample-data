We have introduced a new sequence space l(r, s, t, p ;\Delta^{(m)}) combining by using generalized means and difference operator of order m. We have shown that the space l(r, s, t, p ;\Delta^{(m)}) is complete under some suitable paranorm and it has Schauder basis. Furthermore, the \alpha-, \beta-, \gamma- duals of this space is computed and also obtained necessary and sufficient conditions for some matrix transformations from l(r, s, t, p; \Delta^{(m)}) to l_{\infty}, l_1. Finally, we obtained some identities or estimates for the operator norms and the Hausdorff measure of noncompactness of some matrix operators on the BK space l_{p}(r, s, t ;\Delta^{(m)}) by applying the Hausdorff measure of noncompactness.
