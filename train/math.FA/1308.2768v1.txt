Consider a random matrix H:\mathbb{R}^n\longrightarrow\mathbb{R}^m. Let D\geq2 and let \{W_l\}_{l=1}^{p} be a set of k-dimensional affine subspaces of \mathbb{R}^n. We ask what is the probability that for all 1\leq l\leq p and x,y\in W_l, \[   \|x-y\|_2\leq\|Hx-Hy\|_2\leq D\|x-y\|_2. \] We show that for m=O\big(k+\frac{\ln{p}}{\ln{D}}\big) and a variety of different classes of random matrices H, which include the class of Gaussian matrices, existence is assured and the probability is very high. The estimate on m is tight in terms of k,p,D.
