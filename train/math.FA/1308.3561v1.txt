In this paper by using W_{n}-mapping, we introduce a composite iterative method for finding a common fixed point for infinite family of nonexpansive mappings and a solution of a certain variational inequality. Furthermore, the strong convergence of the proposed iterative method is established. Finally, some simulation examples are presented. Our results improve and extend the previous results.
