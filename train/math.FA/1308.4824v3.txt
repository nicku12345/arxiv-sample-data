The main result of this paper is a proof that, for any f \in L_1[a,b], a sequence of its orthogonal projections (P_{\Delta_n}(f)) onto splines of order k with arbitrary knots \Delta_n, converges almost everywhere provided that the mesh diameter |\Delta_n| tends to zero, namely \[ f \in L_1[a,b] \Rightarrow P_{\Delta_n}(f,x) \to f(x) \quad \mbox{a.e.} \quad (|\Delta_n|\to 0)\,. \] This extends the earlier result that, for f \in L_p, we have convergence P_{\Delta_n}(f) \to f in the L_p-norm for 1 \le p \le \infty.}
