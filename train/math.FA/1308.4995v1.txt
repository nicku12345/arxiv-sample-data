It is shown that the algebra \(L^\infty(\mu)\) of all bounded measurable functions with respect to a finite measure \(\mu\) is localizing on the Hilbert space \(L^2(\mu)\) if and only if the measure \(\mu\) has an atom. Next, it is shown that the algebra \(H^\infty({\mathbb D})\) of all bounded analytic multipliers on the unit disc fails to be localizing, both on the Bergman space \(A^2({\mathbb D})\) and on the Hardy space \(H^2({\mathbb D}).\) Then, several conditions are provided for the algebra generated by a diagonal operator on a Hilbert space to be localizing. Finally, a theorem is provided about the existence of hyperinvariant subspaces for operators with a localizing subspace of extended eigenoperators. This theorem extends and unifies some previously known results of Scott Brown and Kim, Moore and Pearcy, and Lomonosov, Radjavi and Troitsky.
