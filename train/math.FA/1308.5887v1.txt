We extend the basic elements of Clark's theory of rank-one perturbations of backward shifts, to row-contractive operators associated to de Branges-Rovnyak type spaces \mathcal H(b) contractively contained in the Drury-Arveson space on the unit ball in \mathbb C^d. The Aleksandrov-Clark measures on the circle are replaced by a family of states on a certain noncommutative operator system, and the backward shift is replaced by a canonical solution to the Gleason problem in \mathcal H(b). In addition we introduce the notion of a "quasi-extreme" multiplier of the Drury-Arveson space and use it to characterize those \mathcal H(b) spaces that are invariant under multiplication by the coordinate functions.
