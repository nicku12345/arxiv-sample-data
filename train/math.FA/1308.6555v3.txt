Let C_0(K, X) denote the space of all continuous X-valued functions defined on the locally compact Hausdorff space K which vanish at infinity, provided with the supremum norm. If X is the scalar field, we denote C_0(K, X) by simply C_0(K). In this paper we prove that for locally compact Hausdorff spaces K and L and for Banach space X containing no copy of c_0, if there is a isomorphic embedding of C_0(K) into C_0(L,X) where either X is separable or X^* has the Radon-Nikod\'ym property, then either K is finite or |K|\leq |L|. As a consequence of this result, if there is a isomorphic embedding of C_0(K) into C_0(L,X) where X contains no copy of c_0 and L is scattered, then K must be scattered.
