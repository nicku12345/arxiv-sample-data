In this paper we introduce a generalization of Hilbert C-modules which are pre- Finsler module namely C-semi-inner product spaces. Some properties and results of such spaces are investigated, specially the orthogonality in these spaces will be considered. We then study bounded linear operators on C-semi-inner product spaces.
