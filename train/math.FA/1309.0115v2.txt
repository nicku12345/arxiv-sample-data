We prove that, for p \in [1, \infty), and integers d at least 2, the L^p analog {\mathcal{O}}_d^p of the Cuntz algebra {\mathcal{O}}_d is a purely infinite simple amenable Banach algebra.   The proof requires what we call the spatial L^p UHF algebras, which are analogs of UHF algebras acting on L^p spaces. As for the usual UHF C*-algebras, they have associated supernatural numbers. For fixed p \in [1, \infty), we prove that any spatial L^p UHF algebra is simple and amenable, and that two such algebras are isomorphic if and only if they have the same supernatural number (equivalently, the same scaled ordered K_0-group). For distinct p_1, p_2 \in [1, \infty), we prove that no spatial L^{p_1} UHF algebra is isomorphic to any spatial L^{p_2} UHF algebra.
