In the present paper, by using the band matrix F defined by the Fibonacci sequence, we introduce the sequence sequence spaces c_0(F) and c(F). Also, we give some inclusion relations and construct the bases of the spaces c_0(F) and c(F). Finally, we compute the alpha-, beta-, gamma-duals of these spaces and characterize the classes (c_0(F),X) and (c(F),X) for certain choice of the sequence space X.
