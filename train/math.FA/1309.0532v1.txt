First we show that tight nonorthogonal fusion frames a relatively easy to com by. In order to do this we need to establish a classification of how to to wire a self adjoint operator as a product of (nonorthogonal) projection operators. We also discuss the link between nonorthogonal fusion frames and positive operator valued measures, we define and study a nonorthogonal fusion frame potential, and we introduce the idea of random nonorthogonal fusion frames.
