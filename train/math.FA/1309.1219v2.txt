If \left(\h,\langle\cdot,\cdot\rangle\right) is a Hilbert space and on it we consider the sesquilinear form \langle\,W\cdot,\cdot\rangle so-called W-metric, where W^{*}=W\in\BH, and \ker\,W=\{0\}, then the space \left(\h,\langle\,W\cdot,\cdot\rangle\right) is called Hilbert space with W-metric or simply W-space. In this paper we investigate the dynamic of frames of subspace on these spaces, where the sense of dynamics refers to the behavior of frames of subspace in \h_{W} (the completion of \left(\h,\langle\,W\cdot,\cdot\rangle\right)) comparing with \h and vice versa. This work is based on the study made in \cite{KEFER,GMMM} on frames in Krein spaces. In a similar way, Casazza and Kutyniok obtained some results in the context of Hilbert spaces, see \cite{CG}.   We take tools of theory of C^{*}-algebra, and properties of \BH, to show that every Hilbert space with W-metric \h_{W} with 0\in\sigma(W) has a decomposition \h_{W}=\bigoplus_{n\in\N\cup\{\infty\}}\h_{\psi_{n}}^{W}, where \h_{\psi_{n}}^{W}\simeq \Ele(\sigma(W),x\,d\mu_{n}(x)) are Krein spaces, for every n\in\N\cup\{\infty\}. Moreover, we investigate the dynamics of frames of subspace when the self-adjoint operator W is unbounded.
