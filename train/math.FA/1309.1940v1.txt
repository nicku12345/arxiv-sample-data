Let \Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^n be a domain that supports the p-Poincar\'e inequality. Given a homeomorphism \varphi \in L^1_p(\Omega), for p>n we show the domain \varphi(\Omega) has finite geodesic diameter. This result has a direct application to Brennan's conjecture and quasiconformal homeomorphisms. {\bf The Inverse Brennan's conjecture} states that for any simply connected plane domain \Omega' \subset\mathbb C with nonempty boundary and for any conformal homeomorphism \varphi from the unit disc \mathbb{D} onto \Omega' the complex derivative \varphi' is integrable in the degree s, -2<s<2/3. If \Omega' is bounded than -2<s\leq 2. We prove that integrability in the degree s> 2 is not possible for domains \Omega' with infinite geodesic diameter.
