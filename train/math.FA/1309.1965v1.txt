We introduce the concept of {\em maximal lineability cardinal number}, \mL(M), of a subset M of a topological vector space and study its relation to the cardinal numbers known as: additivity A(M), homogeneous lineability \HL(M), and lineability \LL(M) of M. In particular, we will describe, in terms of \LL, the lineability and spaceability of the families of the following Darboux-like functions on \real^n, n\ge 1: extendable, Jones, and almost continuous functions.
