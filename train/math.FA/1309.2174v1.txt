We use a method involving elementary submodels and a partial converse of Foran lemma to prove separable reduction theorems concerning Suslin sigma-P-porous sets where "P" can be from a rather wide class of porosity-like relations in complete metric spaces. In particular, we separably reduce the notion of Suslin cone small set in Asplund spaces. As an application we prove a theorem stating that a continuous approximately convex function on an Asplund space is Frechet differentiable up to a cone small set.
