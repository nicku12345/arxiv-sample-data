This is a survey on reproducing kernel Krein spaces and their interplay with operator valued Hermitian kernels. Existence and uniqueness properties are carefully reviewed. The approach we follow in this survey uses a more abstract but very useful concept of linearization or Kolmogorov decomposition, as well as the underlying concept of Krein space induced by a selfadjoint operator and that of Krein space continuously embedded. The operator range feature of reproducing kernel spaces is emphasized. We include a careful presentation of Hermitian kernels on complex regions that points out a universality property of the Szego kernels with respect to reproducing kernel Krein spaces of holomorphic functions.
