It is shown that an ordered vector space X is Archimedean if and only if \inf\limits_{\tau\in\{\tau\}, y\in L}(x_\tau -y) \ = 0 for any bounded decreasing net x_\tau\downarrow in X, where L is the collection of all lower bounds of \{x_\tau\}_{\tau}. We give also a characterization of the almost Archimedean property of X in terms of existence of a linear extension of an additive mapping T:Y_+\to X_+ of the positive cone Y_+ of an ordered vector space Y into X_+.
