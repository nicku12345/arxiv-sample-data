We consider finite frames with high redundancy so that if half the terms transmitted from the sender are randomly deleted during transmission, then on average, the receiver can still recover the signal to within a high level of accuracy. This follows from a result in random matrix theory. We also give an application of the operator Khintchine inequality in the setting of signal recovery when the signal is a matrix with a sparse representation.
