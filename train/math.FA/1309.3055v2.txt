In this paper, the spectrum, residual spectrum, point spectrum and spectral radius of weighted conditional type operators are computed. As an application, we give an equivalent condition for weighted conditional type operators to be quasinilpotent. Also, several examples are provided to illus- trate concrete application of the main results of the paper.
