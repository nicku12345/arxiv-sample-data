Let B(X) be the algebra of all bounded linear operators on a complex Banach space X with dim X greater than 3. In this paper, we characterize the forms of surjective linear maps on B(X) which preserve the dimension of the vector space containing of all fixed points of operators, whenever X is a fifinite dimensional Banach space. Moreover, we characterize the forms of linear maps on B(X) which preserve the vector space containing of all fixed points of operators.
