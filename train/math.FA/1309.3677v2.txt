In this paper the analytic characterization of generalized poles of operator valued generalized Nevanlinna functions (including the length of Jordan chains of the representing relation) is completed. In particular, given a Jordan chain of length \ell, we show that there exists a pole cancellation function of order at least \ell, and, moreover, this function is of surprisingly simple form.
