In this study, we define a new triangle matrix \hat{W}=\{w_{nk}^{\lambda}(r,s,t)\} which derived by using multiplication of \lambda=(\lambda_{nk}) triangle matrix with B(r,s,t) triple band matrix. Also, we introduce the sequence spaces c_{0}^{\lambda}(\hat{B}),c^{\lambda}(\hat{B}),\ell_{\infty}^{\lambda}(\hat{B}) and \ell_{p}^{\lambda}(\hat{B}) by using matrix domain of this matrix on the sequence spaces c_{0},c,\ell_{\infty} and \ell_{p} of the matrix \hat{W}, respectively. Moreover, we show that norm isomorphic to the spaces c_{0},c,\ell_{\infty} and \ell_{p}, respectively. Furthermore, we establish some inclusion relations concerning with those spaces and determine \alpha-,\beta-\gamma- duals of those spaces and construct their Schauder basis. Finally, we characterize the classes (\mu_{1}^{\lambda}(\hat{B}):\mu_{2}) of infinite matrices, where \mu_{1}\in\{c,c_{0},\ell_{p}\} and \mu_{2}\in\{\ell_{\infty},c,c_{0},\ell_{p}\}.
