In this paper, we study the best constant of the following discrete Hardy-Littlewood-Sobolev inequality, \begin{equation} \sum_{i,j,i\neq j}\frac{f_{i}g_{j}}{\mid i-j\mid^{n-\alpha}}\leq C_{r,s,\alpha} |f|_{l^r} |g|_{l^s}, \end{equation}where i,j\in \mathbb Z^n, r,s>1, 0<\alpha<n, and \frac 1r+\frac 1s+\frac {n-\alpha}n\geq 2. Indeed, we can prove that the best constant is attainable in the supercritical case \frac 1r+\frac 1s+\frac {n-\alpha}n> 2.
