Assume that a block operator of the form \left(\begin{smallmatrix}A_{1}\\A_{2}\quad 0\end{smallmatrix}\right), acting on the Banach space X_{1}\times X_{2}, generates a contraction C_{0}-semigroup. We show that the operator A_{S} defined by A_{S}x=A_{1}\left(\begin{smallmatrix}x\\SA_{2}x\end{smallmatrix}\right) with the natural domain generates a contraction semigroup on X_{1}. Here, S is a boundedly invertible operator for which \epsilon\ide-S^{-1} is dissipative for some \epsilon>0. With this result the existence and uniqueness of solutions of the heat equation can be derived from the wave equation.
