For each n \in \mathbb{N} a Banach space \mathfrak{X}_{0,1}^n is constructed is having the property that every normalized weakly null sequence generates either a c_0 or \ell_1 spreading models and every infinite dimensional subspace has weakly null sequences generating both c_0 and \ell_1 spreading models. The space \mathfrak{X}_{0,1}^n is also quasiminimal and for every infinite dimensional closed subspace Y of \mathfrak{X}_{0,1}^n, for every S_1,S_2,\ldots,S_{n+1} strictly singular operators on Y, the operator S_1S_2\cdots S_{n+1} is compact. Moreover, for every subspace Y as above, there exist S_1,S_2,\ldots,S_n strictly singular operators on Y, such that the operator S_1S_2\cdots S_n is non-compact.
