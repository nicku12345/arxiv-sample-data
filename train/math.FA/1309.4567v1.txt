Let G be an infinite, compact abelian group and let \varLambda be a subset of its dual group \varGamma. We study the question which spaces of the form C_\varLambda(G) or L^1_\varLambda(G) and which quotients of the form C(G)/C_\varLambda(G) or L^1(G)/L^1_\varLambda(G) have the Daugavet property. We show that C_\varLambda(G) is a rich subspace of C(G) if and only if \varGamma \setminus \varLambda^{-1} is a semi-Riesz set. If L^1_\varLambda(G) is a rich subspace of L^1(G), then C_\varLambda(G) is a rich subspace of C(G) as well. Concerning quotients, we prove that C(G)/C_\varLambda(G) has the Daugavet property, if \varLambda is a Rosenthal set, and that L^1_\varLambda(G) is a poor subspace of L^1(G), if \varLambda is a nicely placed Riesz set.
