A Banach space X is Grothendieck if the weak and the weak^* convergence of sequences in the dual space X^* coincide. The space \ell^\infty is a classical example of a Grothendieck space due to Grothendieck. We introduce a quantitative version of the Grothendieck property, we prove a quantitative version of the above-mentioned Grothendieck's result and we construct a Grothendieck space which is not quantitatively Grothendieck. We also establish the quantitative Grothendieck property of L^\infty(\mu) for a \sigma-finite measure \mu.
