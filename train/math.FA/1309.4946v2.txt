We prove that for a strongly continuous semigroup on the Fr\'echet space of all scalar sequences, its generator is a continuous linear operator and that the semigroup can be represented as exp(tA) where the exponential series converges in a very strong sense. This solves a problem posed by Conejero. Moreover, we improve recent results of Albanese, Bonet, and Ricker about semigroups on strict projective limits of Banach spaces.
