We show that every Banach space containing isomorphic copies of c_0 can be equivalently renormed so that every nonempty relatively weakly open subset of its unit ball has diameter 2 and, however, its unit ball still contains convex combinations of slices with diameter arbitrarily small, which improves in a optimal way the known results about the size of this kind of subsets in Banach spaces.
