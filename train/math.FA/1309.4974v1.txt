We give complete characterisation of topologically injective (bounded below), topologically surjective (open mapping), isometric and coisometric (quotient mapping) multiplication operators between L_p spaces defined on different \sigma-finite measure spaces. We prove that all such operators invertible from the left or from the right. As the consequence we prove that all objects of the category of L_p spaces considered as left Banach modules over algebra of bounded measurable functions are metrically, extremelly and relatively projective, injective and flat.
