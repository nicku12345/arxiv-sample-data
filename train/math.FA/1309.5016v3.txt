For an almost radial and typical weight v, we characterize the continuity and compactness of the weighted composition operator u C_{\varphi} acting on the weighted Banach spaces of analytic functions H_{v}^{\infty} in terms of the nth power of the symbol \varphi, where u: \mathbb{D} \to \mathbb{C} is an analytic function and \varphi: \mathbb{D} \to \mathbb{D} is analytic. More precisely, we extend the results of Hyv\"arinen, Kemppainen, Lindstr\"om, Rautio and Saukko relating to the continuity and essential norm calculus of the operator u C_{\varphi}.
