The aim of this paper is to study the basic properties of the Thompson metric d_T in the general case of a real linear space X ordered by a cone K. We show that d_T has monotonicity properties which make it compatible with the linear structure. We also prove several convexity properties of d_T and some results concerning the topology of d_T, including a brief study of the d_T-convergence of monotone sequences. It is shown most of the results are true without any assumption of an Archimedean-type property for K. One considers various completeness properties and one studies the relations between them. Since d_T is defined in the context of a generic ordered linear space, with no need of an underlying topological structure, one expects to express its completeness in terms of properties of the ordering, with respect to the linear structure. This is done in this paper and, to the best of our knowledge, this has not been done yet. The Thompson metric d_T and order-unit (semi)norms |\cdot|_u are strongly related and share important properties, as both are defined in terms of the ordered linear structure. Although d_T and |\cdot|_u are only topological (and not metrical) equivalent on K_u, we prove that the completeness is a common feature. One proves the completeness of the Thompson metric on a sequentially complete normal cone in a locally convex space. At the end of the paper, it is shown that, in the case of a Banach space, the normality of the cone is also necessary for the completeness of the Thompson metric.
