The aim of this article is to extend results of Maslyuchenko O., Mykhaylyuk V. Popov M. about narrow operators on vector lattices. We give a new definition of a narrow operator where a vector lattice as the domain space of a narrow operator is replaced with a lattice-normed space. We prove that every GAM-compact (bo)-norm continuous linear operator from a Banach-Kantorovich space V to a Banach lattice Y is narrow. Then we show that, under some mild conditions, a continuous dominated operator is narrow if and only if its exact dominant is narrow.
