We study the way in which the Euclidean subspaces of a Banach space fit together, somewhat in the spirit of the Ka\v{s}in decomposition. The main tool that we introduce is an estimate regarding the convex hull of a convex body in John's position with a Euclidean ball of a given radius, which leads to a new and simplified proof of the randomized isomorphic Dvoretzky theorem. Our results also include a characterization of spaces with nontrivial cotype in terms of arrangements of Euclidean subspaces.
