We investigate the summability of the coefficients of m-homogeneous polynomials and m-linear mappings defined on \ell_{p}-spaces. In our research we obtain results on the summability of the coefficients of m-linear mappings defined on \ell_{p_{1}} \times \cdots \times \ell_{p_{m}}. The first results in this respect go back to Littlewood and Bohnenblust and Hille (for bilinear and m-linear forms on c_{0}) and Hardy and Littlewood and Praciano-Pereira (for bilinear and m-linear forms on arbitrary \ell_{p}-spaces). Our results recover and in some case complete these old results through a general approach on vector valued m-linear mappings.
