We consider the space of abstract Uryson operators firstly introduced in [9]. We obtain the formulas for band projections on the band generated by increasing set of a positive Uryson operators and on the band generated one-dimensional abstract Uryson operators. We also calculate the laterally continuous part of a abstract Uryson operator.
