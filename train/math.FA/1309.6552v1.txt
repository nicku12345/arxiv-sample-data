We extend a theorem of Kato on similarity for sequences of projections in Hilbert spaces to the case of isomorphic Schauder decompositions in certain Banach spaces. To this end we use \ell_{\Psi}-Hilbertian and \infty-Hilbertian Schauder decompositions instead of orthogonal Schauder decompositions, generalize the concept of an orthogonal Schauder decomposition in a Hilbert space and introduce the class of spaces with Schauder-Orlicz decompositions. Furthermore, we generalize the notions of type, cotype, infratype and M-cotype of a Banach space and study the properties of unconditional Schauder decompositions in spaces possessing certain geometric structure.
