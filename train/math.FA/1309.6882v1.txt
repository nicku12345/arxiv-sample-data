Operator-valued Q-functions for special pairs of nonnegative selfadjoint extensions of nonnegative not necessarily densely defined operators are defined and their analytical properties are studied. It is shown that the Kre\u\i n-Ovcharenko statement announced in \cite{KrO2} is valid only for Q-functions of densely defined symmetric operators with finite deficiency indices. A general class of boundary triplets for a densely defined nonnegative operator is constructed such that the corresponding Weyl functions are of Kre\u\i n-Ovcharenko type.
