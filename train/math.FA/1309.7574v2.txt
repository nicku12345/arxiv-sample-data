Toeplitz plus Hankel operators T(a)+H(b), a,b\in L^\infty acting on the classical Hardy spaces H^p, 1<p<\infty, are studied. If the generating functions a and b satisfy the so-called matching condition a(t) a(1/t)=b(t) b(1/t), an effective description of the structure of the kernel and cokernel of the corresponding operator is given. The results depend on the behaviour of two auxiliary scalar Toeplitz operators, and if the generating functions a and b are piecewise continuous, more detailed results are obtained.
