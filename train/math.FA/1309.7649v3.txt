We show that for each p\in(0,1] there exists a separable p-Banach space \mathbb G_p of almost universal disposition, that is, having the following extension property: for each \epsilon>0 and each isometric embedding g:X\to Y, where Y is a finite dimensional p-Banach space and X is a subspace of \mathbb G_p, there is an \epsilon-isometry f:Y\to \mathbb G_p such that x=f(g(x)) for all x\in X.   Such a space is unique, up to isometries, does contain an isometric copy of each separable p-Banach space and has the remarkable property of being "locally injective" amongst p-Banach spaces.   We also present a nonseparable generalization which is of universal disposition for separable spaces and "separably injective". No separably injective p-Banach space was previously known for p<1.
