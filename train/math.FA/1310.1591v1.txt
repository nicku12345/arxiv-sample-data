In this note we extend some recent results in the space of regular operators. In particular, we provide the following Banach lattice version of a classical result of Kalton: Let E be an atomic Banach lattice with an order continuous norm and F a Banach lattice. Then the following are equivalent: (i) L^r(E,F) contains no copy of \ell_\infty, \,\, (ii) L^r(E,F) contains no copy of c_0, \,\, (iii) K^r(E,F) contains no copy of c_0, \,\, (iv) K^r(E,F) is a (projection) band in L^r(E,F), \,\, (v) K^r(E,F)=L^r(E,F).
