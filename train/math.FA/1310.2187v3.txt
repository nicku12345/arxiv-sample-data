We discuss transfer-function realization for multivariable holomorphic functions mapping the unit polydisk or the right polyhalfplane into the operator analogue of either the unit disk or the right halfplane (Schur/Herglotz functions over either the unit polydisk or the right polyhalfplane) which satisfy the appropriate stronger contractive/positive real part condition for the values of these functions on commutative tuples of strict contractions/strictly accretive operators (Schur--Agler/Herglotz--Agler functions over either the unit polydisk or the right polyhalfplane). As originally shown by Agler, the first case (polydisk to disk) can be solved via unitary extensions of a partially defined isometry constructed in a canonical way from a kernel decomposition for the function (the {\em lurking-isometry method}). We show how a geometric reformulation of the lurking-isometry method (embedding of a given isotropic subspace of a Kre\u{\i}n space into a Lagrangian subspace---the {\em lurking-isotropic-subspace method}) can be used to handle the second two cases (polydisk to halfplane and polyhalfplane to disk), as well as the last case (polyhalfplane to halfplane) if an additional growth condition at \infty is imposed. For the general fourth case, we show how a linear-fractional-transformation change of variable can be used to arrive at the appropriate symmetrized nonhomogeneous Bessmertny\u{\i} long-resolvent realization. We also indicate how this last result recovers the classical integral representation formula for scalar-valued holomorphic functions mapping the right halfplane into itself.
