Let \{K_t\}_{t>0} be the semigroup of linear operators generated by a Schr\"odinger operator -L=\Delta - V(x) on \mathbb R^d, d\geq 3, where V(x)\geq 0 satisfies \Delta^{-1} V\in L^\infty. We say that an L^1-function f belongs to the Hardy space H^1_L if the maximal function \mathcal M_L f(x) = \sup_{t>0} |K_tf(x)| belongs to L^1(\mathbb R^d) . We prove that the operator (-\Delta)^{1\slash 2} L^{-1\slash 2} is an isomorphism of the space H^1_L with the classical Hardy space H^1(\mathbb R^d) whose inverse is L^{1\slash 2} (-\Delta)^{-1\slash 2}. As a corollary we obtain that the space H^1_L is characterized by the Riesz transforms R_j=\frac{\partial}{\partial x_j}L^{-1\slash 2}.
