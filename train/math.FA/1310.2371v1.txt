We show that non of the spaces (\bigoplus_{n=1}^\infty\ell_p)_{\ell_q}, 1\le p\not= q<\infty, have a greedy basis. This solves a problem raised by Dilworth, Freeman, Odell and Schlumprect. Similarly, the spaces (\bigoplus_{n=1}^\infty\ell_p)_{c_0}, 1\le p<\infty, and (\bigoplus_{n=1}^\infty c_o)_{\ell_q}, 1\le q<\infty, do not have greedy bases. It follows from that and known results that a class of Besov spaces on \R^n lack greedy bases as well.
