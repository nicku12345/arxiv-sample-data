By using Riemann--Hilbert problem based techniques, we obtain the asymptotic expansion of lacunary Toeplitz determinants \det_N\big[ c_{\ell_a-m_b}[f] \big] generated by holomorhpic symbols, where \ell_a=a (resp. m_b=b) except for a finite subset of indices a=h_1,\dots, h_n (resp. b=t_1,\dots, t_r). In addition to the usual Szeg\"{o} asymptotics, our answer involves a determinant of size n+r.
