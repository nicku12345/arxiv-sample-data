Various characterizations of unbounded closed densely defined operators commuting with the spectral measures of their moduli are established.In particular, Kaufman's definition of an unbounded quasinormal operator is shown to coincide with that given by the third-named author and Szafraniec. Examples demonstrating the sharpness of results are constructed.
