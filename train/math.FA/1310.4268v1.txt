Let \Omega_1,\Omega_2\subset {\mathbb C} be bounded domains. Let \phi:\Omega_1\rightarrow \Omega_2 holomorphic in \Omega_1 and belonging to W^{1,\infty}_{\Omega_2}(\Omega_1). We study the composition operators f\mapsto f\circ\phi on generalized Hardy spaces on \Omega_2, recently considered in \cite{bfl, BLRR}. In particular, we provide necessary and/or sufficient conditions on \phi, depending on the geometry of the domains, ensuring that these operators are bounded, invertible, isometric or compact. Some of our results are new even for Hardy spaces of analytic functions.
