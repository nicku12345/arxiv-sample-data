A net (x_\alpha) in a vector lattice X is said to be {unbounded order convergent} (or uo-convergent, for short) to x\in X if the net (\abs{x_\alpha-x}\wedge y) converges to 0 in order for all y\in X_+. In this paper, we study unbounded order convergence in dual spaces of Banach lattices. Let X be a Banach lattice. We prove that every norm bounded uo-convergent net in X^* is w^*-convergent iff X has order continuous norm, and that every w^*-convergent net in X^* is uo-convergent iff X is atomic with order continuous norm. We also characterize among \sigma-order complete Banach lattices the spaces in whose dual space every simultaneously uo- and w^*-convergent sequence converges weakly/in norm.
