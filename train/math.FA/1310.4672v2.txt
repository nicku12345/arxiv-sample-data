We show that a bounded analytic semigroup on an L_p-space has a bounded H^{\infty}(\Sigma_{\varphi})-calculus for some \varphi < \frac{\pi}{2} if and only if the semigroup can be obtained, after restricting to invariant subspaces, factorizing through invariant subspaces and similarity transforms, from a bounded analytic semigroup on some bigger L_p-space which is positive and contractive on the real line.
