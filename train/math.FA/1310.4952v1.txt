We derive a matrix model, under unitary similarity, of an n-by-n matrix A such that A, A^2, \ldots, A^k (k\ge 1) are all partial isometries, which generalizes the known fact that if A is a partial isometry, then it is unitarily similar to a matrix of the form {\scriptsize\left[\begin{array}{cc} 0 & B 0 & C\end{array}\right]} with B^*B+C^*C=I. Using this model, we show that if A has ascent k and A, A^2, \ldots, A^{k-1} are partial isometries, then the numerical range W(A) of A is a circular disc centered at the origin if and only if A is unitarily similar to a direct sum of Jordan blocks whose largest size is k. As an application, this yields that, for any S_n-matrix A, W(A) (resp., W(A\otimes A)) is a circular disc centered at the origin if and only if A is unitarily similar to the Jordan block J_n. Finally, examples are given to show that the conditions that W(A) and W(A\otimes A) are circular discs at 0 are independent of each other for a general matrix A.
