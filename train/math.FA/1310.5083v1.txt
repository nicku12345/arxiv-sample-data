Various properties of the (continuous) Ces\`aro operator \mathsf{C}, acting on Banach and Fr\'echet spaces of continuous functions and L^p-spaces, are investigated. For instance, the spectrum and point spectrum of \mathsf{C} are completely determined and a study of certain dynamics of \mathsf{C} is undertaken (eg. hyper- and supercyclicity, chaotic behaviour). In addition, the mean (and uniform mean) ergodic nature of \mathsf{C} acting in the various spaces is identified.
