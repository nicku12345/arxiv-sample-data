We study the well-posedness of a linear control system \Sigma(A,B,C,D) with unbounded control and observation operators. To this end we associate to our system an operator matrix \mathcal{A} on a product space \mathcal{X}^p and call it p-well-posed if \mathcal{A} generates a strongly continuous semigroup on \mathcal{X}^p. Our approach is based on the Laplace transform and Fourier multipliers.
