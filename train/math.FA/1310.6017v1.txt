Brezis and Mironescu have announced several years ago that for a compact manifold N^n \subset \mathbb{R}^\nu and for real numbers 0 < s < 1 and 1 \le p < \infty the class C^\infty(\overline{Q}^m; N^n) of smooth maps on the cube with values into N^n is dense with respect to the strong topology in the Sobolev space W^{s, p}(Q^m; N^n) when the homotopy group \pi_{\lfloor sp \rfloor}(N^n) of order \lfloor sp \rfloor is trivial. The proof of this beautiful result is long and rather involved. Under the additional assumption that N^n is \lfloor sp \rfloor simply connected, we give a shorter proof of their result. Our proof for sp \ge 1 is based on the existence of a retraction of \mathbb{R}^\nu onto N^n except for a small subset in the complement of N^n and on the Gagliardo-Nirenberg interpolation inequality for maps in W^{1, q} \cap L^\infty. In contrast, the case sp < 1 relies on the density of step functions on cubes in W^{s, p}.
