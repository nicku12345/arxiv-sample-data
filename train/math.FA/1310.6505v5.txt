Let d\in\mathbb N and f be a function in the Orlicz class L(\log^+L)^{d-1} defined on the unit cube [0,1]^d in \mathbb{R}^d. Given partitions \Delta_1,\ldots, \Delta_d of [0,1], we first prove that the orthogonal projection P_{(\Delta_1,\dots,\Delta_d)}(f) onto the space of tensor product splines with arbitrary orders (k_1,\dots, k_d) and knots \Delta_1,\ldots,\Delta_d converges to f almost everywhere as the mesh diameters |\Delta_1|,\ldots, |\Delta_{d}| tend to zero. This extends the one-dimensional result in [Passenbrunner and Shadrin, Journal of Approximation Theory, 2014] to arbitrary dimensions.   In a second step, we show that this result is optimal, i.e., given any "bigger" Orlicz class X=\sigma(L)L(\log^+ L)^{d-1} with an arbitrary function \sigma tending to zero at infinity, there exists a function \varphi\in X and partitions of the unit cube such that the orthogonal projections of \varphi do not converge almost everywhere.
