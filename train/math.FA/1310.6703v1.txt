In this paper we provide sufficient conditions that ensure the monotonicity, respectively the global injectivity of an operator. Further, some new analytical conditions that assure the injectivity/univalence of a complex function of one complex variable are obtained. We also show that some classical results, such as Alexander-Noshiro-Warschawski and Wolff theorem or Mocanu theorem, are easy consequences of our results.
