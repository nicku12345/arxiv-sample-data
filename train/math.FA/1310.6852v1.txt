In this paper we consider the generalized shift operator, generated by the Gegenbauer differential operator  G =\left(x^2-1\right)^{\frac{1}{2}-\lambda} \frac{d}{dx} \left(x^2-1\right)^{\lambda+\frac{1}{2}}\frac{d}{dx}.  Maximal function ( G-  maximal function), generated by the Gegenbauer differential operator  G  is investigated. The  L_{p,\lambda}  -boundedness for the  G-  maximal function is obtained. The concept of potential of Riesz-Gegenbauer is introduced and for it the theorem of Sobolev type is proved.
