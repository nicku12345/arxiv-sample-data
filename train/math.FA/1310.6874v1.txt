We give a rate of metastability for Halpern's iteration relative to a rate of metastability for the resolvent for nonexpansive mappings in uniformly smooth Banach spaces, extracted from a proof due to Xu. In Hilbert space, the latter is known, so we get an explicit rate of metastability. We also extract a rate of asymptotic regularity for general normed spaces. Such rates have already been extracted by Kohlenbach and Leu\c{s}tean for different and incomparable conditions on (\lambda_n). The proof analyzed in this paper is also more effective than the proofs treated by Kohlenbach and Leu\c{s}tean in that it does not use Banach limits or weak compactness, which makes the extraction particularly efficient. Moreover, we also give an equivalent axiomatization of uniformly smooth Banach spaces. This paper is part of an ongoing case study of proof mining in nonlinear fixed point theory.
