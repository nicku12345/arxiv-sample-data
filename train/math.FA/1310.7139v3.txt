We prove that the spaces \ell_p, 1<p<\infty, p\ne 2, and all infinite-dimensional subspaces of their quotient spaces do not admit equivalent almost transitive renormings. This is a step towards the solution of the Banach-Mazur rotation problem, which asks whether a separable Banach space with a transitive norm has to be isometric or isomorphic to a Hilbert space. We obtain this as a consequence of a new property of almost transitive spaces with a Schauder basis, namely we prove that in such spaces the unit vector basis of \ell_2^2 belongs to the two-dimensional asymptotic structure and we obtain some information about the asymptotic structure in higher dimensions.   Further, we prove that the spaces \ell_p, 1<p<\infty, p\ne 2, have continuum different renormings with 1-unconditional bases each with a different maximal isometry group, and that every symmetric space other than \ell_2 has at least a countable number of such renormings. On the other hand we show that the spaces \ell_p, 1<p<\infty, p\ne 2, have continuum different renormings each with an isometry group which is not contained in any maximal bounded subgroup of the group of isomorphisms of \ell_p.
