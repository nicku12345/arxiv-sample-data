The S-functional calculus is a functional calculus for (n+1)-tuples of non necessarily commuting operators that can be considered a higher dimensional version of the classical Riesz-Dunford functional calculus for a single operator. In this last calculus, the resolvent equation plays an important role in the proof of several results. Associated with the S-functional calculus there are two resolvent operators: the left S_L^{-1}(s,T) and the right one S_R^{-1}(s,T), where s=(s_0,s_1,\ldots,s_n)\in \mathbb{R}^{n+1} and T=(T_0,T_1,\ldots,T_n) is an (n+1)-tuple of non commuting operators. These two S-resolvent operators satisfy the S-resolvent equations S_L^{-1}(s,T)s-TS_L^{-1}(s,T)=\mathcal{I}, and sS_R^{-1}(s,T)-S_R^{-1}(s,T)T=\mathcal{I}, respectively, where \mathcal{I} denotes the identity operator. These equations allows to prove some properties of the S-functional calculus. In this paper we prove a new resolvent equation for the S-functional calculus which is the analogue of the classical resolvent equation. It is interesting to note that the equation involves both the left and the right S-resolvent operators simultaneously.
