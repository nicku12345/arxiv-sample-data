We prove that of the creator operators, on the d commuting indeterminates polynomial algebra, are linearly independent. We further study the connection between the classical (one dimensional) and the multi-dimensional (d-dimensional, d \geq 1) Favard Lemmas. Moreover, we investigate the dependence of the Jacobi sequences on the linear change of basis of \mathbb{C}^d. Finally we prove that the Jacobi sequences associated to the probability measure product on \mathbb{R}^d are diagonal matrices in the basis introduced by the tensor product of the orthogonal polynomials of the factor measures.
