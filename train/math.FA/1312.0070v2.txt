Let b(z) = \prod_{n=1}^\infty \frac{-\bar{\alpha}_n}{|\alpha_n|} \frac{z - \alpha_n}{1 - \bar{\alpha}_n z}, where \sum_{n=1}^\infty (1 - |\alpha_n|) <\infty, be the Blaschke product with zeros at \alpha_n \in \mathbb{D} \setminus \{0\}. Then \cls = \vee_{n=1}^\infty \big(z^n H^2(\mathbb{D})\big) \otimes \big(\prod_{k=n}^\infty \frac{-\bar{\alpha}_n}{|\alpha_n|} \frac{z - \alpha_n}{1 - \bar{\alpha}_n z} H^2(\mathbb{D})\big) is a joint (M_{z_1}, M_{z_2}) invariant subspace of the Hardy space H^2(\mathbb{D}^2) \cong H^2(\mathbb{D}) \otimes H^2(\mathbb{D}). This class of subspaces was originally introduced by Rudin in the context of infinite cardinality of generating sets of shift invariant subspaces of H^2(\mathbb{D}^2).   \noindent In this paper we prove that for a Rudin invariant subspace \cls of H^2(\mathbb{D}^2), the cross commutator [(P_{\cls} M_{z_1}|_{\cls})^*, M_{z_2}|_{\cls}] = (P_{\cls} M_{z_1} |_{\cls})^* (M_{z_2}|_{\cls}) - (M_{z_2}|_{\cls}) (P_{\cls} M_{z_1}|_{\cls})^* is not compact. Consequently, Rudin's invariant subspaces are both infinitely generated and not essentially doubly commuting.
