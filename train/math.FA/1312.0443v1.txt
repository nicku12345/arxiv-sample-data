We provide a characterization of wavelets on local fields of positive characteristic based on results on affine and quasi affine frames. This result generalizes the characterization of wavelets on Euclidean spaces by means of two basic equations. We also give another characterization of wavelets. Further, all wavelets which are associated with a multiresolution analysis on a such a local field are also characterized.
