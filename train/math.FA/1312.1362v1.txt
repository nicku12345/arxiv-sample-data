The de Branges--Rovnyak spaces are known to provide an alternate functional model for contractions on a Hilbert space, equivalent to the Sz.-Nagy--Foias model. The scalar de Branges--Rovnyak spaces \mathcal{H}(b) have essentially different properties, according to whether the defining function b is or not extreme in the unit ball of H^\infty. For b extreme the model space is just \mathcal{H}(b), while for b nonextreme an additional construction is required. In the present paper we identify the precise class of contractions which have as a model \mathcal{H}(b) with b nonextreme.
