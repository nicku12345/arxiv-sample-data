We prove a generalization of a Hardy type inequality for negative exponents valid for non-negative functions defined on (0,1]. As an application we find the exact best possible range of p such that 1<p\le q such that any non-decreasing \phi which satisfies the Muckenhoupt A_q condition with constant c upon all open subintervals of (0,1] should additionally satisfy the A_p condition for another possibly real constant c'. The result have been treated in \cite{9} based on \cite{1}, but we give in this paper an alternative proof which relies on the above mentioned inequality.
