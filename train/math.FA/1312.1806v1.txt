In order to extend the theory of well-bounded operators to include operators with nonreal spectrum, Ashton and Doust introduced definitions for two new algebras of functions defined on a nonempty compact subset \sigma of the plane. These are the functions of bounded variation and the absolutely continuous functions on \sigma. Proofs involving absolutely continuous functions usually require that one first works with elements of a dense subset and then take limits. In this paper we present some new theorems about approximating absolutely continuous functions as well as providing missing proofs for some important earlier results.
