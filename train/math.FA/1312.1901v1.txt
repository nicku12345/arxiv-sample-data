The research on spectral inequalities for discrete Schrodinger Operators has proved fruitful in the last decade. Indeed, several authors analysed the operator's canonical relation to a tridiagonal Jacobi matrix operator. In this paper, we consider a generalisation of this relation with regards to connecting higher order Schrodinger-type operators with symmetric matrix operators with arbitrarily many non-zero diagonals above and below the main diagonal. We thus obtain spectral bounds for such matrices, similar in nature to the Lieb{Thirring inequalities.
