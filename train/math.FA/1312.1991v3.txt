We prove a sharp integral inequality valid for non-negative functions defined on [0,1], with given L^1 norm. This is in fact a generalization of the well known integral Hardy inequality. We prove it as a consequence of the respective weighted discrete analogue inequality which proof is presented in this paper. As an application we find the exact best possible range of p>q such that any non-increasing f which satisfies a reverse H\"{o}lder inequality with exponent q and constant c upon the subintervals of [0,1], should additionally satisfy a reverse H\"{o}lder inequality with exponent p and a different in general constant c'. The result has been treated in \cite{1} but here we give an alternative proof based on the above mentioned inequality.
