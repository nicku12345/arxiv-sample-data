This paper provides a fixed point theorem and iterative construction of a common fixed point for a general class of nonlinear mappings in the setup of uniformly convex hyperbolic spaces. We translate a multi-step iteration, essentially due to Chidume and Ofoedu [4] in such setting for the approximation of common fixed points of a finite family of total asymptotically nonexpansive mappings. As a consequence, we establish strong and del-convergence results which extend and generalize various corresponding results announced in the current literature.
