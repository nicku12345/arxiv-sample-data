Let \lambda be a complex number in the closed unit disc \overline{\Bbb D}, and \cal H be a separable Hilbert space with the orthonormal basis, say, {\cal E}=\{e_n:n=0,1,2,\cdots\}. A bounded operator T on \cal H is called a {\em \lambda-Toeplitz operator} if \langle Te_{m+1},e_{n+1}\rangle=\lambda\langle Te_m,e_n\rangle (where \langle\cdot,\cdot\rangle is the inner product on \cal H). The subject arises naturally as the "eigenoperators" of the map \[ \phi(A)=S^*AS \] on the {\cal B}(\cal H), the space of bounded operators on \cal H, where S is the unilateral shift on Se_n=e_{n+1}.   In this paper, we study the essential spectra for \lambda-Toeplitz operators when |\lambda|=1, and we will use the results to determine the spectra of certain weighted composition operators on Hardy spaces.
