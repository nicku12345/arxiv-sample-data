It is known that the k-dimensional Hausdorff measure on a k-dimensional submanifold of \mathbb{R}^n is closely related to the Lebesgue measure on \mathbb{R}^n. We show that the Ashtekar-Lewandowski measure on the space of generalized G-connections for a compact, semi-simple, Lie group G, is analogously related to the product measure on the set of all G-valued functions on the group of loops. We also show that, the Ashtekar-Lewandowski measure is, under very mild conditions, supported on nowhere-continuous generalized connections.
