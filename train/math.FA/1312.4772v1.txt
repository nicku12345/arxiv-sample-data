Considered are operators that leave the set of non-invertible (in the sense of Ehrenpreis) distributions stable. They simultaneously generalise the operation of convolution by a distribution with compact support and the operation of multiplication by a real analytic function; they are here called pseudo-convolutions since they also generalise pseudo-differential operators. (It is shown that the elliptic real analytic pseudo-differential operators leave both the non-invertible and the invertible distributions invariant.) But when the condition of real-analyticity is relaxed, such operators may map a non-invertible distribution to one invertible -- given that the invertibility in both cases concerns the same function space. By varying the space, however, one can measure the 'loss of non-invertibily' that a non-analytic perturbation may introduce. This phenomenon is here studied using the Beurling classes of functions and measuring the regularity of operator symbols in the Denjoy-Carleman sense; the Gevrey case turns out particularly simple.
