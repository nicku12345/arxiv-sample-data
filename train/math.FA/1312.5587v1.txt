In this paper, we will obtain the strong type and weak type estimates for vector-valued analogues of intrinsic square functions in the generalized weighted Morrey spaces M^{\Phi,\varphi}_{w}(\mathbb{R}^n). We study the boundedness of intrinsic square functions including the Lusin area integral, Littlewood-Paley \mathrm{g}-function and \mathrm{g}_{\lambda}^{*} -function and their commutators on vector-valued generalized weighted Morrey spaces M^{\Phi,\varphi}_{w}(l_2). In all the cases the conditions for the boundedness are given either in terms of Zygmund-type integral inequalities on \varphi(x,r) without assuming any monotonicity property of \varphi(x,r) on r.
