In this note, we establish the estimate on the Lorentz space L(3/2,1) for vector fields in bounded domains under the assumption that the normal or the tangential component of the vector fields on the boundary vanishing. We prove that the L(3/2,1) norm of the vector field can be controlled by the norms of its divergence and curl in the atomic Hardy spaces and the L^1 norm of the vector field itself.
