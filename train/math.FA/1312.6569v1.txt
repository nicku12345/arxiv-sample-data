For a tuple A=(A_1,\ A_2,\ ...,\ A_n) of elements in a unital algebra {\mathcal B} over \mathbb{C}, its {\em projective spectrum} P(A) or p(A) is the collection of z\in \mathbb{C}^n, or respectively z\in \mathbb{P}^{n-1} such that the multi-parameter pencil A(z)=z_1A_1+z_2A_2+\cdots +z_nA_n is not invertible in {\mathcal B}. {\mathcal B}-valued 1-form A^{-1}(z)dA(z) contains much topological information about P^c(A):=\mathbb{C}^n\setminus P(A). In commutative cases, invariant multi-linear functionals are effective tools to extract that information. This paper shows that in non-commutative cases, the cyclic cohomology of {\mathcal B} does a similar job. In fact, a Chen-Weil type map \kappa from the cyclic cohomology of {\mathcal B} to the de Rham cohomology H^*_d(P^c(A),\ \mathbb{C}) is established. As an example, we prove a closed high-order form of the classical Jacobi's formula.
