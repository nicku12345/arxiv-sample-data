A variety of different orthogonal wavelet bases has been found in L_2(R) for the last three decades. It appeared that similar constructions also exist for functions defined on some other algebraic structures, such as the Cantor and Vilenkin groups and local fields of positive characteristic. In the present paper we show that the situation is quite different for the field of p-adic numbers. Namely, it is proved that any orthogonal wavelet basis consisting of band-limited (periodic) functions is a modification of Haar basis. This is a little bit unexpected because from the wavelet theory point of view, the additive group of p-adic numbers looks very similar to the Vilenkin group where analogs of the Daubechies wavelets (and even band-limited ones) do exist. We note that all p-adic wavelet bases and frames appeared in the literature consist of Schwartz-Bruhat functions (i.e., band-limited and compactly supported ones).
