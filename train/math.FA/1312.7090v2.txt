Closed operators in Hilbert space defined by a non-self-adjoint resolution of the identity \{X(\lambda)\}_{\lambda\in {\mb R}}, whose adjoints constitute also a resolution of the identity, are studied . In particular, it is shown that a closed operator B has a spectral representation analogous to the familiar one for self-adjoint operators if and only if B=TAT^{-1} where A is self-adjoint and T is a bounded operator with bounded inverse.
