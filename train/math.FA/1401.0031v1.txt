Let u be a holomorphic function and \varphi a holomorphic self-map of the open unit disk \mathbb{D} in the complex plane. We give some new characterizations for the boundedness of the weighted composition operators uC_{\varphi} from Bloch type spaces to Zygmund type spaces in \mathbb{D} in terms of u, \varphi, their derivatives and the n-th power \varphi^n of \varphi. Moreover, we obtain some similar estimates for their essential norms. From which the sufficient and necessary conditions of compactness of the operators uC_{\varphi} follows immediately.
