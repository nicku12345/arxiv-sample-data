Let (X,\left\Vert \cdot \right\Vert ) be a real normed space of dimension N\in \mathbb{N} with a basis (e_{i})_{1}^{N} such that the norm is invariant under coordinate permutations. Assume for simplicity that the basis constant is at most 2. Consider any n\in \mathbb{N} and 0<\varepsilon <1/4 such that n\leq c(\log \varepsilon ^{-1})^{-1}\log N. We provide an explicit construction of a matrix that generates a (1+\varepsilon ) embedding of \ell _{2}^{n} into X.
