The inverse question of identifying a function from the nodes (zeroes) of its wavelet transform arises in a number of fields. These include whether the nodes of a heat or hypoelliptic equation solution determine its initial conditions, and in mathematical vision theory the Marr conjecture, on whether an image is mathematically determined by its edge information. We prove a general version of this conjecture by reducing it to the moment problem, using a basis dual to the Taylor monomial basis x^\alpha on \mathbb {R}^n.
