The fact that finite direct sums of two or more mutually different spaces from the family \{\ell_{p} : 1\le p<\infty\}\cup c_{0} fail to have greedy bases is stated in [Dilworth et al., Greedy bases for Besov spaces, Constr. Approx. 34 (2011), no. 2, 281-296]. However, the concise proof that the authors give of this fundamental result in greedy approximation relies on a fallacious argument, namely the alleged uniqueness of unconditional basis up to permutation of the spaces involved. The main goal of this note is to settle the problem by providing a correct proof. For that we first show that all greedy bases in an \ell_{p} space have fundamental functions of the same order. As a by-product of our work we obtain that every almost greedy basis of a Banach space with unconditional basis and nontrivial type contains a greedy subbasis.
