It is an open problem whether any pair of Bessel sequences with wavelet structure can be extended to a pair of dual frames by adding a pair of singly generated wavelet systems. We consider the particular case where the given wavelet systems are generated by the multiscale setup with trigonometric masks and provide a positive answer under extra assumptions. We also identify a number of conditions that are necessary for the extension to dual multiscale wavelet frames with any number of generators, and show that they imply that an extension with two pairs of wavelet systems is possible. Along the way we provide examples showing that extensions to dual frame pairs are attractive because they often allow better properties than the more popular extensions to tight frames.
