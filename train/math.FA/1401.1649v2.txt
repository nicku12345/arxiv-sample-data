The present paper presents a counterexample to the sequentially weak density of smooth maps between two manifolds M and N in the Sobolev space W^{1, p} (M, N), in the case p is an integer. It has been shown that, if p<\dim M  is not an integer and the [p]-th homotopy group \pi_{[p]}(N) of N is not trivial, [p] denoting the largest integer less then p, then smooth maps are not sequentially weakly dense in W^{1, p} (M, N) for the strong convergence. On the other, in the case p< \dim M is an integer, examples have been provided where smooth maps are actually sequentially weakly dense in W^{1, p} (M, N) with \pi_{p}(N)\not = 0. This is the case for instance for M= \mathbb B^m, the standard ball in \mathbb R^m, and N=\mathbb S^p the standard sphere of dimension p, for which \pi_{p}(N) =\mathbb Z. The main result of this paper shows however that such a property does not holds for arbitrary manifolds N and integers p.Our counterexample deals with the case p=3, \dim M\geq 4 and N=\mathbb S^2, for which the homotopy group \pi_3(\mathbb S^2)=\mathbb Z is related to the Hopf fibration.
