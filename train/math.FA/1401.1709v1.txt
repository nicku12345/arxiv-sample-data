A branch of generalizations of the Banach Fixed Point Theorem replaces contractivity by a weaker but still effective property. The aim of the present note is to extend the contraction principle in this spirit for such complete semimetric spaces that fulfill an extra regularity property. The stability of fixed points is also investigated in this setting. As applications, fixed point results are presented for several important generalizations of metric spaces.
