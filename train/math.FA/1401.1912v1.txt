Let L be the infinitesimal generator of an analytic semigroup on L^2(\mathbb{R}^n) with Gaussian kernel bounds, and let L^{-\alpha/2} be the fractional integrals of L for 0<\alpha<n. Assume that \vec{b}=(b_1,b_2,\cdots,b_m) is a finite family of locally integrable functions, then the multilinear commutators generated by \vec{b} and L^{-\alpha/2} is defined by \begin{equation*} L_{\vec{b}}^{-\alpha/2}f=[b_m,\cdots,[b_2,[b_1,L^{-\alpha/2}]],\cdots,]f \end{equation*} when b_j\in BMO(w), j=1,2,\cdots,m, the authors obtain the boundedness of L_{\vec{b}}^{-\alpha/2} on weighted Morrey spaces.
