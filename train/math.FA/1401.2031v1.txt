Given Banach spaces X and Y and operators A\in B(X) and B\in B(Y), property (gw) does not in general transfer from A and B to the tensor product operator A\otimes B\in B(X\overline{\otimes} Y) or to the elementary operator defined by A and B, \tau_{AB}=L_AR_B\in B(B(Y,X)). In this article necessary and sufficient conditions ensuring that property (gw) transfers from A and B to A\otimes B and to \tau_{AB} will be given.
