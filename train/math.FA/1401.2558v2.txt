In this paper, we countinue our work in \cite{11}.   We show that L^{1}(G,w) is \phi_{0}-biprojective if and only if G is compact, where \phi_{0} is the augmentation character. We introduce the notions of character Johnson amenability and character Johnson contractibility for Banach algebras. We show that \ell^{1}(S) is pseudo-amenable if and only if \ell^{1}(S) is character Johnson-amenable, provided that S is a uniformly locally finite band semigroup.   We give some conditions whether \phi-biprojectivity (\phi-biflatness) of \ell^{1}(S) implies the finiteness (amenability) of S, respectively.
