Wiener-Hopf plus Hankel operators W(a)+H(b):L^p(\mathbb{R}^+)\to L^p(\mathbb{R}^+) with generating functions a and b from a subalgebra of L^\infty(\mathbb{R}) containing almost periodic functions and Fourier images of L^1(\mathbb{R})-functions are studied. For a and b satisfying the so-called matching condition   \begin{equation*} a(t) a(-t)=b(t) b(-t), \quad t\in \mathbb{R}, \end{equation*} we single out some classes of operators W(a)+H(b) which are subject to Coburn-Simonenko theorem.
