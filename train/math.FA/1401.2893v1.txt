This paper continues the study of interpolation operators on scattered data. We introduce the Poisson interpolation operator and prove various properties. The main result concerns functions in the Paley-Wiener space PW_{B_\beta}, and shows that one may recover these functions from their samples on a complete interpolating sequence for [-\delta,\delta]^2 by using the Poisson interpolation operator, provided that 0<\beta < (3-\sqrt{8})\delta.
