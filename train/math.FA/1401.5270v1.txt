Ultrafunctions are a particular class of functions defined on a Non Archimedean field R^{*}\supset R. They have been introduced and studied in some previous works ([1],[2],[3]). In this paper we introduce a modified notion of ultrafunction and we discuss sistematically the properties that this modification allows. In particular, we will concentrated on the definition and the properties of the operators of derivation and integration of ultrafunctions.
