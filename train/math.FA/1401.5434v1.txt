We characterize the atomic probability measure on \mathbb{R}^d which having a finite number of atoms. We further prove that the Jacobi sequences associated to the multiple Hermite (resp. Laguerre, resp. Jacobi) orthogonal polynomials are diagonal matrices. Finally, as a consequence of the multiple Jacobi orthogonal polynomials case, we give the Jacobi sequences of the   Gegenbauer, Chebyshev and Legendre orthogonal polynomials.
