A Banach space operator T\in B(X) is left polaroid if for each \lambda\in\hbox{iso}\sigma_a(T) there is an integer d(\lambda) such that asc (T-\lambda)=d(\lambda)<\infty and (T-\lambda)^{d(\lambda)+1}X is closed; T is finitely left polaroid if asc (T-\lambda)<\infty, (T-\lambda)X is closed and \dim(T-\lambda)^{-1}(0)<\infty at each \lambda\in\hbox{iso }\sigma_a(T). The left polaroid property transfers from A and B to their tensor product A\otimes B, hence also from A and B^* to the left-right multiplication operator \tau_{AB}, for Hilbert space operators; an additional condition is required for Banach space operators. The finitely left polaroid property transfers from A and B to their tensor product A\otimes B if and only if 0\not\in\hbox{iso}\sigma_a(A\otimes B); a similar result holds for \tau_{AB} for finitely left polaroid A and B^*.
