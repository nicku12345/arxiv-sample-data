We study abstract Ces\`aro spaces CX, which may be regarded as generalizations of Ces\`aro sequence spaces ces_p and Ces\`aro function spaces Ces_p(I) on I = [0,1] or I = [0,\infty), and also as the description of optimal domain from which Ces\`aro operator acts to X. We find the dual of such spaces in a very general situation. What is however even more important, we do it in the simplest possible way. Our proofs are more elementary than the known ones for ces_p and Ces_p(I). This is the point how our paper should be seen, i.e. not as generalization of known results, but rather like grasping and exhibiting the general nature of the problem, which is not so easy visible in the previous publications. Our results show also an interesting phenomenon that there is a big difference between duality in the cases of finite and infinite interval.
