I give an explicitly verifiable necessary and sufficient condition for the uniqueness of the eigenform on finitely ramified fractals, once an eigenform is known. This improves the results of my previous paper [14], where I gave some necessary and some sufficient conditions, and with a relatively mild additional requirement on the known eigenform. The result of this paper can be interpreted as a uniqueness result for self-similar energies on the fractal.
