Let \mathcal{X} be a finite-dimensional complex vector space and let k be a positive integer. An explicit formula for the k-reflexivity defect of the image of a generalized derivation on L(\mathcal{X}), the space of all linear transformations on \mathcal{X}, is given. Using latter, we also study the k-reflexivity defect of the image of an elementary operator of the form \Delta(T)=ATB-T (T \in L(\mathcal{X})).
