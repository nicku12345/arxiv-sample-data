We study boundedness and compactness of composition operators on weighted Bergman spaces of Dirichlet series. Particularly, we obtain in some specific cases, upper and lower bounds of the essential norm of these operators and a criterion of compactness on classicals weighted Bergman spaces. Moreover, a sufficient condition of compactness is obtained using the notion of Carleson's measure.
