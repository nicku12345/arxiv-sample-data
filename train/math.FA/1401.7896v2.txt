We provide coincidence results for vector-valued ideals of multilinear operators. More precisely, if \mathfrak A is an ideal of n-linear mappings we give conditions for which the following equality \mathfrak A(E_1,\dots,E_n;F) = {\mathfrak A}^{min}(E_1,\dots,E_n;F) holds isometrically. As an application, we obtain in many cases that the monomials form a Schauder basis on the space \mathfrak A(E_1,\dots,E_n;F). Several structural and geometric properties are also derived using this equality. We apply our results to the particular case where \mathfrak A is the classical ideal of extendible or Pietsch-integral multilinear operators. Similar statements are given for ideals of vector-valued homogeneous polynomials.
