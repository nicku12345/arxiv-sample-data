In this paper, we give some results concerning atomic decompositions for operators on reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces, using frame theory techniques. We provide also generalizations for atomic decompositions of some theorems for reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. In particular, we obtain atomic decomposition results for operators on Bergman spaces and Fock spaces in a simple manner.
