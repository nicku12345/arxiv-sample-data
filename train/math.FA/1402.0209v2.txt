For any origin-symmetric convex body K in \mathbb{R}^n in isotropic position, we obtain the bound: \[ M^*(K) \leq C \sqrt{n} \log(n)^2 L_K ~, \] where M^*(K) denotes (half) the mean-width of K, L_K is the isotropic constant of K, and C>0 is a universal constant. This improves the previous best-known estimate M^*(K) \leq C n^{3/4} L_K. Up to the power of the \log(n) term and the L_K one, the improved bound is best possible, and implies that the isotropic position is (up to the L_K term) an almost 2-regular M-position. The bound extends to any arbitrary position, depending on a certain weighted average of the eigenvalues of the covariance matrix. Furthermore, the bound applies to the mean-width of L_p-centroid bodies, extending a sharp upper bound of Paouris for 1 \leq p \leq \sqrt{n} to an almost-sharp bound for an arbitrary p \geq \sqrt{n}. The question of whether it is possible to remove the L_K term from the new bound is essentially equivalent to the Slicing Problem, to within logarithmic factors in n.
