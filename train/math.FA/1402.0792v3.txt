A natural generalization of Krein's theorem to a pair of commuting tuples \left(H_1^0,H_2^0\right) and \left(H_1,H_2\right) of bounded self-adjoint operators in a separable Hilbert space \mathcal{H} with H_j-H_j^0 = V_j\in \mathcal{B}_2(\mathcal{H})(set of all Hilbert-Schmidt operators on \mathcal{H}) for j=1,2, leads to a Stokes-like formula under trace. A major ingredient in the proof is the finite-dimensional approximation result for commuting self-adjoint n-tuples of operators, a generalization of Weyl-von Neumann-Berg's theorem.
