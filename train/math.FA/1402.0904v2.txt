Let K be a centrally-symmetric convex body in \mathbb{R}^n and let \|\cdot\| be its induced norm on {\mathbb R}^n. We show that if K \supseteq r B_2^n then: \[ \sqrt{n} M(K) \leqslant C \sum_{k=1}^{n} \frac{1}{\sqrt{k}} \min\left(\frac{1}{r} , \frac{n}{k} \log\Big(e + \frac{n}{k}\Big) \frac{1}{v_{k}^{-}(K)}\right) . \] where M(K)=\int_{S^{n-1}} \|x\|\, d\sigma(x) is the mean-norm, C>0 is a universal constant, and v^{-}_k(K) denotes the minimal volume-radius of a k-dimensional orthogonal projection of K. We apply this result to the study of the mean-norm of an isotropic convex body K in {\mathbb R}^n and its L_q-centroid bodies. In particular, we show that if K has isotropic constant L_K then: \[   M(K) \leqslant \frac{C\log^{2/5}(e+ n)}{\sqrt[10]{n}L_K} . \]
