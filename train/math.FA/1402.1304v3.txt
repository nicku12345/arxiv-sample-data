For \left(C(t)\right)_{t \geq 0} being a strongly continuous cosine family on a Banach space, we show that the estimate \limsup_{t\to 0^{+}}\|C(t) - I\| <2 implies that C(t) converges to I in the operator norm. This implication has become known as the zero-two law. We further prove that the stronger assumption of \sup_{t\geq0}\|C(t)-I\|<2 yields that C(t)=I for all t\geq0. Additionally, we derive alternative proofs for similar results for C_{0}-semigroups.
