Consider a smooth vector field f\colon \mathbb{R}^n\to\mathbb{R}^n and a maximal solution \gamma\colon \,]a,b[\,\to \mathbb{R}^n to the ordinary differential equation x'=f(x). It is a well-known fact that, if \gamma is bounded, then \gamma is a global solution, i.e., \,]a,b[\,=\mathbb{R}. We show by example that this conclusion becomes invalid if \mathbb{R}^n is replaced with an infinite-dimensional Banach space.
