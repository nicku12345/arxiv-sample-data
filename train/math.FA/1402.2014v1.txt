We introduce some symmetric homogeneous means, and then show unitarily invariant norm inequalities for them, applying the method established by Hiai and Kosaki. Our new inequalities give the tighter bounds of the logarithmic mean than the inequalities given by Hiai and Kosaki. Some properties and norm continuities in parameter for our means are also discussed.
