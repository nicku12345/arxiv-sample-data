In this paper we devote to study Qian's problem for \mathcal{L}_{\infty}-spaces. Firstly, a positive answer to Qian's problem for C(K)-spaces is given by the assumption that K has the C\check{e}ch-Stone property. Secondly, we obtain quantitative characterizations of separably injective spaces that turn out to give a positive answer to Qian's problem of 1995 in the setting of separable universality. Thirdly, we prove a sharpen quantitative and generalized Sobczyk theorem, which gives sharpen constants (\alpha,\gamma) for Qian's Problem. Finally, we give a more generalized Figiel theorem for \mathcal{L}_{\infty}-spaces.
