Different notions of amenability on hypergroups and their relations are studied. Developing Leptin's theorem for discrete hypergroups, we characterize the existence of a bounded approximate identity for hypergroup Fourier algebras. We study the Leptin condition for discrete hypergroups derived from the representation theory of some classes of compact groups. Studying amenability of the hypergroup algebras for discrete commutative hypergroups, we obtain some results on amenability properties of some central Banach algebras on compact and discrete groups.
