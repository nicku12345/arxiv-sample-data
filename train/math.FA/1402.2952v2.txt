We fully characterize orthogonal projections of infinite right circular (round) cones in real Hilbert spaces. Another interpretation is that, given two vectors in a real Hilbert space, we establish the optimal estimate on the angle between the orthogonal projections of the two vectors. The estimate depends on the angle between the two vectors and the position of only one of the two vectors. Our results also make a contributions to Cauchy-Bunyakovsky-Schwarz type inequalities.
