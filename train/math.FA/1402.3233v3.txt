In this article we study simplicity and traces of reduced L^p operator crossed products F^p_{\mathrm{r}}(G, A, \alpha). Given p \in (1, \infty), let G be a Powers group, and let \alpha \colon G \to Aut(A) be an isometric action of G on a unital L^p operator algebra A such that A is G-simple. We prove that the reduced L^p operator crossed product of A by G, F^p_{\mathrm{r}}(G, A, \alpha), is simple. Moreover, we show that traces on F^p_{\mathrm{r}}(G, A, \alpha) are in correspondence with G-invariant traces on A. Our results generalize the results obtained by de la Harpe for reduced C^*crossed products in 1985. By letting G be a countable nonabelian free group as a special case, we recover an analogue of a result of Powers from 1975. For the case p = 1, it turns out that (reduced) L^p operator group algebras are not simple.
