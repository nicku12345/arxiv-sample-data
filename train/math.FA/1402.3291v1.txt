A function f defined on a subset E of a two normed space X is statistically ward continuous if it preserves statistically quasi-Cauchy sequences of points in E where a sequence (x_n) is statistically quasi-Cauchy if (\Delta x_{n}) is a statistically null sequence. A subset E of X is statistically ward compact if any sequence of points in E has a statistically quasi-Cauchy subsequence. In this paper, new kinds of continuities are investigated in two normed spaces. It turns out that uniform limit of statistically ward continuous functions is again statistically ward continuous.
