A finite collection of unit vectors S \subset \mathbb{R}^n is called a spherical two-distance set if there are two numbers a and b such that the inner products of distinct vectors from S are either a or b. We prove that if a\ne -b, then a two-distance set that forms a tight frame for \mathbb{R}^n is a spherical embedding of a strongly regular graph, and every strongly regular graph gives rise to two-distance tight frames through standard spherical embeddings. Together with an earlier work by S. Waldron on the equiangular case ({\em Linear Alg. Appl.}, vol. 41, pp. 2228-2242, 2009) this completely characterizes two-distance tight frames. As an intermediate result, we obtain a classification of all two-distance 2-designs.\
