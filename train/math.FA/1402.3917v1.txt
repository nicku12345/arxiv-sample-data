We set up a new general coorbit space theory for reproducing representations of a locally compact second countable group G that are not necessarily irreducible nor integrable. Our basic assumption is that the kernel associated with the voice transform belongs to a Fr\'echet space \mathcal T of functions on G, which generalizes the classical choice \mathcal T=L_w^1(G). Our basic example is  \mathcal T=\bigcap_{p\in(1,+\infty)} L^p(G), or a weighted versions of it. By means of this choice it is possible to treat, for instance, Paley-Wiener spaces and coorbit spaces related to Shannon wavelets and Schr\"odingerlets.
