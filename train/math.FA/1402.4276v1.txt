We study the relations between the Lipschitz constant of 1-field and the Lipschitz constant of the gradient canonically associated with this 1-field. Moreover, we produce two explicit formulas that make up Minimal Lipschitz extensions for 1-field. As consequence of the previous results, for the problem of minimal extension by continuous functions from \mathbb{R}^m to \mathbb{R}^n, we also produce analogous explicit formulas to those of Bauschke and Wang. Finally, we show that Wells's extensions of 1-field are absolutely minimal Lipschitz extension when the domain of 1-field to expand is finite. We provide a counter-example showing that this result is false in general.
