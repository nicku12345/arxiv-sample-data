In this note, we continue to highlight some applications of Theorem 1 of [3]. Here is a sample: Let X be an open set in {\bf C}^n, \Omega an open convex set in {\bf C} and f, g : X\to {\bf C} two holomorphic functions such that f(X)\cap\Omega\neq\emptyset, f(X)\setminus\Omega\neq \emptyset and g(X)\subseteq \Omega. Then, there exists a set A in [0,1] with the following properties:(a) for each x\in X, there exists \lambda\in A such that \lambda g(x)+(1-\lambda)f(x)\in\Omega\ ; (b) for each finite set B in A, there exists u\in X such that \mu g(u)+(1-\mu)f(u)\in {\bf C}\setminus\Omega for all \mu\in B.
