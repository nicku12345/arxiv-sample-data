In this paper, we define and study subspace-diskcyclic operators. We show that subspace-diskcyclicity does not imply to diskcyclicity. We establish a subspace-diskcyclic criterion and use it to find a subspace-diskcyclic operator that is not subspace-hypercyclic for any subspaces. Also, we show that the inverse of invertible subspace-diskcyclic operators do not need to be subspace-diskcyclic for any subspaces. Finally, we prove that every finite-dimensional separable Hilbert space over the complex field supports a subspace-diskcyclic operator.
