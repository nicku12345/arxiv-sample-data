Let \Lambda be a sub-semigroup of the reals. We show that the Bass and topological stable ranks of the algebras {\rm AP}_\Lambda=\{f\in {\rm AP}: \sigma(f)\subseteq \Lambda\} of almost periodic functions on the real line and with Bohr spectrum in \Lambda are infinite whenever the algebraic dimension of the \mathbb Q-vector space generated by \Lambda is infinite. This extends Su\'arez's result for {\rm AP}_\mathbb R={\rm AP}. Also considered are general subalgebras of AP.
