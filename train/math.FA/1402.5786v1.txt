In this paper, we investigate integrated and differentiated sequence spaces which emerge from the concept of the space bv of sequences of bounded variation.The integrated and differentiated sequence spaces which was initiated by Goes and Goes. The main propose of the present paper, we study of matrix domains and some properties of the integrated and differentiated sequence spaces. In section 3, we compute the alpha-, beta- and gamma duals of these spaces. Afterward, we characterize the matrix classes of these spaces with well-known sequence spaces.
