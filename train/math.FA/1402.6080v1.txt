We show that iterative scheme due to Karahan and \"Ozdemir (2013) can be used to approximate fixed point of contraction mappings. Furthermore, we prove that CR iterative scheme converges faster than the iterative scheme due to Karahan and \"Ozdemir (2013) for the class contraction mappings. Finally, we prove a data dependence result for contraction mappings by employing iterative scheme due to Karahan and \"Ozdemir (2013).
