We show in this paper that every bijective linear isometry between the continuous section spaces of two non-square Banach bundles gives rise to a Banach bundle isomorphism. This is to support our expectation that the geometric structure of the continuous section space of a Banach bundle determines completely its bundle structures. We also describe the structure of an \emph{into} isometry from a continuous section space into an other. However, we demonstrate by an example that a non-surjective linear isometry can be far away from a subbundle embedding.
