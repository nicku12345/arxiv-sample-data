In this paper we describe some new algebraic features of the Gram matrices of complex Equiangular Tight Frames (ETF). This lead on the one hand to the nonexistence of several low dimensional complex ETFs; and on the other hand to the full algebraic classification of all complex ETFs in C^3. We use computer aided methods, in particular, Groebner basis computations to obtain these results.
