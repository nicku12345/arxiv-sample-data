Motivated by a problem stated by S.A.Argyros and Th. Raikoftsalis, we introduce a new class of Banach spaces. Namely, for a sequence of separable Banach spaces (X_n,\|\cdot\|_n)_{n\in\mathbb{N}}, we define the Bourgain Delbaen \mathcal{L}^{\infty}-sum of the sequence (X_n,\|\cdot\|_n)_{n\in\mathbb{N}} which is a Banach space \mathcal{Z} constructed with the Bourgain-Delbaen method. In particular, for every 1\leq p<\infty, taking X_n=\ell_p for every n\in\mathbb{N} the aforementioned space \mathcal{Z}_p is strictly quasi prime and admits \ell_p as a complemented subspace. We study the operators acting on \mathcal{Z}_p and we prove that for every n\in\mathbb{N}, the space \mathcal{Z}^n_p=\sum_{i=1}^n\oplus \mathcal{Z}_p admits exactly n+1, pairwise not isomorphic, complemented subspaces.
