We study functions of two variables whose sections by the lines parallel to the coordinate axis satisfy Lipschitz condition of the order 0<\a\le 1. We prove that if for a function f the \operatorname{Lip} \a- norms of these sections belong to the Lorentz space L^{p,1}(\R) \,(p=1/\a), then f can be modified on a set of measure zero so as to become bounded and uniformly continuous on \R^2. For \a=1 this gives an extension of Sobolev's theorem on continuity of functions of the space W_1^{2,2}(\R^2). We show that the exterior L^{p,1}- norm cannot be replaced by a weaker Lorentz norm L^{p,q} with q>1.
