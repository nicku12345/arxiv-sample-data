This paper deals with generalized Lipschitz spaces \wedge^k_{\alpha,p,q}(\R) in the context of Dunkl harmonic analysis on \R, for all real \alpha. It also introduces a generalized Dunkl-Lipschitz spaces {\cal T}\wedge^k_{\alpha,p,q}(\R^2_+) of k-temperature on \R^2_+.   Some properties and continuous embedding of these spaces and the isomorphism of {\cal T}\wedge^k_{\alpha,p,q}(\R^2_+) and \wedge^k_{\alpha,p,q}(\R) are established.
