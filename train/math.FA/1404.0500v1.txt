Inspired in the theorem of Krein-Milamn, we investigate the existence of extreme points in compact convex subsets of asymmetric normed spaces. We focus our attention in the finite dimensional case, giving a geometric description of all compact convex subsets of a finite dimensional asymmetric normed space.
