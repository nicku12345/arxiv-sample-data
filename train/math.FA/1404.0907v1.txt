In this work characterizations of Fredholm pairs and chains of Hilbert space operators are given. Following a well-known idea of several variable operator theory in Hilbert spaces, the aforementioned objects are characterized in terms of Fredholm linear and bounded maps. Furthermore, as an application of the main results of this work, direct proofs of the stability properties of Fredholm pairs and chains in Hilbert spaces are obtained.
