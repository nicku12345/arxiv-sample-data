It is well-known that curvelets provide optimal approximations for so-called cartoon images which are defined as piecewise C^2-functions, separated by a C^2 singularity curve. In this paper, we consider the more general case of piecewise C^\beta-functions, separated by a C^\beta singularity curve for \beta \in (1,2]. We first prove a benchmark result for the possibly achievable best N-term approximation rate for this more general signal model. Then we introduce what we call \alpha-curvelets, which are systems that interpolate between wavelet systems on the one hand (\alpha = 1) and curvelet systems on the other hand (\alpha = \frac12). Our main result states that those frames achieve this optimal rate for \alpha = \frac{1}{\beta}, up to \log-factors.
