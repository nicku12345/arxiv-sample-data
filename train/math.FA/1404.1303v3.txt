Multiplicatively invariant (MI) spaces are closed subspaces of L^2(\Omega,\mathcal{H}) that are invariant under multiplications of (some) functions in L^{\infty}(\Omega). In this paper we work with MI spaces that are finitely generated. We prove that almost every linear combination of the generators of a finitely generated MI space produces a new set on generators for the same space and we give necessary and sufficient conditions on the linear combinations to preserve frame properties. We then apply what we prove for MI spaces to system of translates in the context of locally compact abelian groups and we obtain results that extend those previously proven for systems of integer translates in L^2(\mathbb{R}^d).
