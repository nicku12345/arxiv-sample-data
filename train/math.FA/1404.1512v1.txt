As a continuation of [GasparPopa] this paper treats the stationary and stationarily cross-correlated multivariate stochastic mappings. Moreover for the case of multivariate random distribution fields, a particular form for the operator cross covariance distribution is given, from which a Kolmogorov type isomorphism theorem and a spectral representation of a stationary multivariate random distribution field are derived.
