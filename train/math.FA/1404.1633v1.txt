In this paper, the fractional Hardy-type operator of variable order \beta(x) is shown to be bounded from the Herz-Morrey spaces M\dot{K}_{p_{_{1}},q_{_{1}}(\cdot)}^{\alpha,\lambda}(\mathbb{R}^{n}) with variable exponent q_{1}(x) into the weighted space M\dot{K}_{p_{_{2}},q_{_{2}}(\cdot)}^{\alpha,\lambda}(\mathbb{R}^{n},\omega), where \omega=(1+|x|)^{-\gamma(x)} with some \gamma(x)>0 and  1/q_{_{1}}(x)-1/q_{_{2}}(x)=\beta(x)/n when q_{_{1}}(x) is not necessarily constant at infinity. It is assumed that the exponent q_{_{1}}(x) satisfies the logarithmic continuity condition both locally and at infinity that 1< q_{1}(\infty)\le q_{1}(x)\le( q_{1})_{+}<\infty~(x\in \mathbb{R}^{n}).
