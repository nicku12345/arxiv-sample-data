Let A be a Banach algebra with a non-empty character space. We say that a bounded net \{e_{\alpha}\} in A is a bounded \Delta-weak approximate identity for A if, for each a\in A and compact subset K of \Delta(A), ||\widehat{e_{\alpha}a}-\widehat{a}||_{K}=\sup_{\phi\in K}|\phi(e_{\alpha}a)-\phi(a)|\rightarrow 0. For each 1<p<\infty, we prove that the Figa-Talamanca Herz algebra, A_{p}(G) has a bounded \Delta-weak approximate identity if and only if G is an amenable group. Also we give a sufficient condition for amenability of group G.
