Let \lambda be a complex number in the closed unit disc \overline{\Bbb D}, and \cal H be a separable Hilbert space with the orthonormal basis, say, {\cal E}=\{e_n:n=0,1,2,\cdots\}. A bounded operator T on \cal H is called a \lambda-Toeplitz operator if  \langle Te_{m+1},e_{n+1}\rangle=\lambda\langle Te_m,e_n\rangle  (where \langle\cdot,\cdot\rangle is the inner product on \cal H). The subject arises naturally from a special case of the operator equation \[ S^*AS=\lambda A+B,\ \mbox{where S is a shift on \cal H}, \] which plays an essential role in finding bounded matrix (a_{ij}) on l^2(\Bbb Z) that solves the system of equations  \left\{\begin{array}{lcc} a_{2i,2j}&=&p_{ij}+aa_{ij}\\ a_{2i,2j-1}&=&q_{ij}+ba_{ij}\\ a_{2i-1,2j}&=&v_{ij}+ca_{ij}\\ a_{2i-1,2j-1}&=&w_{ij}+da_{ij} \end{array}\right.  for all i,j\in\Bbb Z, where (p_{ij}), (q_{ij}), (v_{ij}), (w_{ij}) are bounded matrices on l^2(\Bbb Z) and a,b,c,d\in\Bbb C. It is also clear that the well-known Toeplitz operators are precisely the solutions of S^*AS=A, when S is the unilateral shift. In this paper we verify some basic issues, such as boundedness and compactness, for \lambda-Toeplitz operators and, our main result is to give necessary and sufficient conditions for finite rank \lambda-Toeplitz operators.
