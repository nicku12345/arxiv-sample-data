In this paper the Jessen's type inequality for normalized positive C_0-semigroups is obtained. An adjoint of Jessen's type inequality has also been derived for the corresponding adjoint-semigroup, which does not give the analogous results but the behavior is still interesting. Moreover, it is followed by some results regarding positive definiteness and exponential convexity of complex structures involving operators from a semigroup.
