Given unital Banach algebras A and B and elements a\in A and b\in B, the Drazin spectrun of a\otimes b\in A\overline{\otimes} B will be fully characterized, where A\overline{\otimes} B is a Banach algebra that is the completion of A\otimes B with respect to a uniform crossnorm. To this end, however, first the isolated points of the spectrum of a\otimes b\in A\overline{\otimes} B need to be characterized. On the other hand, given Banach spaces X and Y and Banach space operators S\in L(X) and T\in L(Y), using similar arguments the Drazin spectrum of \tau_{ST}\in L(L(Y,X)), the elementary operator defined by S and T, will be fully characterized.
