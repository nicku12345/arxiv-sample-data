In this paper we introduce vector-valued Hermite expansions to approximate one-parameter operator families such as C_0-groups and cosine functions. In both cases we estimate the rate of convergence of these Hermite expansions to the related family and compare with other known approximations. Finally we illustrate our results with particular examples of C_0-groups and cosine functions and their Hermite expansions.
