In this paper we show that the Fourier transform induces an isomorphism between the coorbit spaces defined by Feichtinger and Gr\"ochenig of the mixed, weighted Lebesgue spaces L_{v}^{p,q} with respect to the quasi-regular representation of a semi-direct product \mathbb{R}^{d}\rtimes H with suitably chosen dilation group H, and certain decomposition spaces \mathcal{D}\left(\mathcal{Q},L^{p},\ell_{u}^{q}\right) (essentially as introduced by Feichtinger and Gr\"obner), where the localized ,,parts`` of a function are measured in the \mathcal{F}L^{p}-norm.   This equivalence is useful in several ways: It provides access to a Fourier-analytic understanding of wavelet coorbit spaces, and it allows to discuss coorbit spaces associated to different dilation groups in a common framework. As an illustration of these points, we include a short discussion of dilation invariance properties of coorbit spaces associated to different types of dilation groups.
