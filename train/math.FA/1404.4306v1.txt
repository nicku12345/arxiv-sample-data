In this paper, we present a characterization of support functionals and smooth points in L_{0}^{\Phi}, the Musielak-Orlicz space equipped with the Orlicz norm. As a result, criterion for the smoothness of L_{0}^{\Phi} is also obtained. Some expressions involving the norms of functionals in (L_{0}^{\Phi})^{*}, the topological dual of L_{0}^{\Phi}, are proved for arbitrary Musielak-Orlicz functions.
