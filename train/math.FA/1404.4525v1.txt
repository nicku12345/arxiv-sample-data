The aim of this paper is to find an expression for second derivative of the function \phi(t) defined by \phi(t) = \lt(\int_V \vphi(t,x)^{-\beta} dx\rt)^{-\frac1{\be -n}},\qquad \beta\not= n, where U\subset \R and V\subset \R^n are open bounded subsets, and \vphi: U\times V\to \R_+ is a C^2-smooth function. As a consequence, this result gives us a direct proof of the dimensional Pr\'ekopa's theorem based on a local approach.
