We determine upper asymptotic estimates of Kolmogorov and linear n-widths of unit balls in Sobolev and Besov norms in L_{p}-spaces on compact Riemannian manifolds. The proofs rely on estimates for the near-diagonal localization of the kernels of elliptic operators. We also summarize some of our previous results about approximations by eigenfunctions of elliptic operators on compact homogeneous manifolds.
