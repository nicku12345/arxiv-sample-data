We study properties of positive operators on Gelfand-Shilov spaces, and distributions which are positive with respect to non-commutative convolutions. We prove that boundedness of kernels K \in \maclD_s^{\prime} to positive operators, are completely determined by the behaviour of K alone the diagonal. We also prove that positive elements a in \mascS^{\prime} with respect to twisted convolutions, having Gevrey class property of order s\geq 1/2 at the origin, then a belongs to the Gelfand-Shilov space \maclS_s.
