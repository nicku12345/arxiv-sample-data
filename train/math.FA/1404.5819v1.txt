Let F and G be two bounded operators on two Hilbert spaces. Let their numerical radii be no greater than one. This note investigate when there is a \Gamma-contraction (S,P) such that F is the fundamental operator of (S,P) and G is the fundamental operator of (S^*,P^*). Theorem 1 puts a necessary condition on F and G for them to be the fundamental operators of (S,P) and (S^*,P^*) respectively. Theorem 2 shows that this necessary condition is sufficient too provided we restrict our attention to a certain special case. The general case is investigated in Theorem 3. Some of the results obtained for \Gamma-contractions are then applied to tetrablock contractions to figure out when two pairs (F_1, F_2) and (G_1, G_2) acting on two Hilbert spaces can be fundamental operators of a tetrablock contraction (A, B, P) and its adjoint (A^*, B^*, P^*) respectively. This is the content of Theorem 4.
