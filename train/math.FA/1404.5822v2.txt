We show that a compact operator A is a multiple of a positive semi-definite operator if and only if  \sigma(AB) \subseteq \overline{W(A)W(B)}, \quad\text{for all (rank one) operators B}.  An example of a normal operator is given to show that the equivalence conditions may fail in general. We then obtain conditions to identify other classes of operators A so that equivalence conditions hold.
