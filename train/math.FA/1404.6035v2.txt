We show that the decay of approximation numbers of compact composition operators on the Dirichlet space \mathcal{D} can be as slow as we wish, which was left open in the cited work. We also prove the optimality of a result of O.~El-Fallah, K.~Kellay, M.~Shabankhah and A.~Youssfi on boundedness on \mathcal{D} of self-maps of the disk all of whose powers are norm-bounded in \mathcal{D}.
