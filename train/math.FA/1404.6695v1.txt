Smoothness of a function f:{\mathbb R}^n\to {\mathbb R} can be measured in terms of the rate of convergence of f\ast\rho_\varepsilon to f, where \rho is an appropriate mollifier. In the framework of fractional Sobolev spaces, we characterize the "appropriate" mollifiers. We also obtain sufficient conditions, close to being necessary, which ensure that \rho is adapted to a given scale of spaces. Finally, we examine in detail the case where \rho is a characteristic function.
