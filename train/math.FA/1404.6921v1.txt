By using an H^{\infty} joint functional calculus for strongly commuting operators, we derive a scheme to deduce the L^p boundedness of certain d-dimensional Riesz transforms from the L^p boundedness of appropriate one-dimensional Riesz transforms. Moreover, the L^p bounds we obtain are independent of the dimension. The scheme is applied to Riesz transforms connected with orthogonal expansions and discrete Riesz transforms on products of groups with polynomial growth.
