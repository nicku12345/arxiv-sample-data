Using Pathak and Pathak techniques, the basic function D^\alpha(u,v,w) associated with general novel fractional wavelet transform (GNFrWT)is defined and its properties are investigated. By using basic function D^\alpha(u,v,w) translation and convolution associated with GNFrWT are defined and certain existence theorems are proved for basic function and associated convolution.
