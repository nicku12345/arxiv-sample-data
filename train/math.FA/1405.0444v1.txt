It is proved that interval quadrature formula of the form  q(f)=\sum\limits_{k=1}^nc_k\frac 1{2h}\int\limits_{x_k-h}^{x_k+h}f(t)dt  (c_k\in \RR, \, x_1+h<x_2-h<x_2+h<...<x_n-h<x_n+h<x_1+2\pi -h) with equal c_k and equidistant x_k is optimal among all such formulas for the class K*F_1 of convolutions of a CVD-kernel K with functions from the unite ball of the space L_1 of 2\pi-periodic integrable functions.
