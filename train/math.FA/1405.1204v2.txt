Bayart, Pellegrino and Seoane recently proved that the polynomial Bohnenblust--Hille inequality for complex scalars is subexponential. We show that a vector valued polynomial Bohnenblust-Hille inequality on complex Banach lattices is also subexponential for some special cases. Our main result result recovers the best known constants of the classical polynomial inequality provided in \cite{bps}.
