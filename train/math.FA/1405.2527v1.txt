We prove that if K is a compact space and the space P(K\times K) of regular probability measures on K\times K has countable tightness in its weak^* topology, then L_1(\mu) is separable for every \mu\in P(K). It has been known that such a result is a consequence of Martin's axiom MA(\omega_1).   Our theorem has several consequences; in particular, it generalizes a theorem due to Bourgain and Todor\v{c}evi\'c on measures on Rosenthal compacta.
