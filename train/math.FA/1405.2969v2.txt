Given an integer m\geq2, the Hardy--Littlewood inequality (for real scalars) says that for all 2m\leq p\leq\infty, there exists a constant C_{m,p}% ^{\mathbb{R}}\geq1 such that, for all continuous m--linear forms A:\ell_{p}^{N}\times\cdots\times\ell_{p}^{N}\rightarrow\mathbb{R} and all positive integers N, \[ \left( \sum_{j_{1},...,j_{m}=1}^{N}\left\vert A(e_{j_{1}},...,e_{j_{m}% })\right\vert ^{\frac{2mp}{mp+p-2m}}\right) ^{\frac{mp+p-2m}{2mp}}\leq C_{m,p}^{\mathbb{R}}\left\Vert A\right\Vert . \] The limiting case p=\infty is the well-known Bohnenblust--Hille inequality; the behavior of the constants C_{m,p}^{\mathbb{R}} is an open problem. In this note we provide nontrivial lower bounds for these constants.
