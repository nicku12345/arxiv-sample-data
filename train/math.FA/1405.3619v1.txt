An ideal I is a family of subsets of positive integers \mathbb{N} which is closed under taking finite unions and subsets of its elements. A sequence (x_k) of real numbers is said to be lacunary I-convergent to a real number \ell, if for each  \varepsilon> 0 the set \left\{r\in \mathbb{N}:\frac{1}{h_r}\sum_{k\in J_r} |x_{k}-\ell|\geq \varepsilon\right\} belongs to I. The aim of this paper is to study the notion of lacunary I-convergence in probabilistic normed spaces as a variant of the notion of ideal convergence. Also lacunary I-limit points and lacunary I-cluster points have been defined and the relation between them has been established. Furthermore, lacunary-Cauchy and lacunary I-Cauchy sequences are introduced and studied. Finally, we provided example which shows that our method of convergence in probabilistic normed spaces is more general.
