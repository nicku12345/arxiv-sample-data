In an Archimedean directed partially ordered vector space X one can define the concept of a band in terms of disjointness. Bands can be studied by using a vector lattice cover Y of X. If X has an order unit, Y can be represented as C(\Omega), where \Omega is a compact Hausdorff space. We characterize bands in X, and their disjoint complements, in terms of subsets of \Omega. We also analyze two methods to extend bands in X to C(\Omega) and show how the carriers of a band and its extensions are related.   We use the results to show that in each n-dimensional partially ordered vector space with a closed generating cone, the number of bands is bounded by \frac{1}{4}2^{2^n} for n\geq 2. We also construct examples of (n+1)-dimensional partially ordered vector spaces with {2n\choose n}+2 bands. This shows that there are n-dimensional partially ordered vector spaces that have more bands than an n-dimensional Archimedean vector lattice when n\geq 4.
