Let T be a quadratic operator on a complex Hilbert space H. We show that T can be written as a product of two positive contractions if and only if T is of the form aI \oplus bI \oplus\begin{pmatrix} aI & P \cr 0 & bI \cr \end{pmatrix} \quad \text{on} \quad H_1\oplus H_2\oplus (H_3\oplus H_3) for some a, b\in [0,1] and strictly positive operator P with \|P\| \le |\sqrt{a} - \sqrt{b}|\sqrt{(1-a)(1-b)}. Also, we give a necessary condition for a bounded linear operator T with operator matrix \begin{pmatrix} T_1 & T_3\\ 0 & T_2\cr\end{pmatrix} on H\oplus K that can be written as a product of two positive contractions.
