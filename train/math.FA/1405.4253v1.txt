Let (X_0, X_1) and (Y_0, Y_1) be complex Banach couples and assume that X_1\subseteq X_0 with norms satisfying \|x\|_{X_0} \le c\|x\|_{X_1} for some c > 0. For any 0<\theta <1, denote by X_\theta = [X_0, X_1]_\theta and Y_\theta = [Y_0, Y_1]_\theta the complex interpolation spaces and by B(r, X_\theta), 0 \le \theta \le 1, the open ball of radius r>0 in X_\theta, centered at zero. Then for any analytic map \Phi: B(r, X_0) \to Y_0+ Y_1 such that \Phi: B(r, X_0)\to Y_0 and \Phi: B(c^{-1}r, X_1)\to Y_1 are continuous and bounded by constants M_0 and M_1, respectively, the restriction of \Phi to B(c^{-\theta}r, X_\theta), 0 < \theta < 1, is shown to be a map with values in Y_\theta which is analytic and bounded by M_0^{1-\theta} M_1^\theta.
