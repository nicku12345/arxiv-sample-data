In this paper we study two design problems in frame theory: on the one hand, given a fixed finite frame \cF for \hil\cong\C^d we compute those dual frames \cG of \cF that are optimal perturbations of the canonical dual frame for \cF under certain restrictions on the norms of the elements of \cG. On the other hand, for a fixed finite frame \cF=\{f_j\}_{j\in\In} for \hil we compute those invertible operators V such that V^*V is a perturbation of the identity and such that the frame V\cdot \cF=\{V\,f_j\}_{j\in\In} - which is equivalent to \cF - is optimal among such perturbations of \cF. In both cases, optimality is measured with respect to submajorization of the eigenvalues of the frame operators. Hence, our optimal designs are minimizers of a family of convex potentials that include the frame potential and the mean squared error. The key tool for these results is a multiplicative analogue of Lidskii's inequality in terms of log-majorization and a characterization of the case of equality.
