We provide complete isomorphic invariance of a class of translation invariant complemented subspaces of L_p constructed by Bourgain, Rosenthal and Schechtman. We compute ordinal L_p-indices for this class. We further show that the isometric index of a tree subspace over a well founded tree is an invariance for the order of the tree. Finally we provide a dichotomy for the subspaces of L_p with small ordinal indices.
