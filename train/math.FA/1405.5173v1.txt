We completely characterize the spectrum of a weighted composition operator W_{\psi, \varphi} on H^{2}(\mathbb{D}) when \varphi has Denjoy-Wolff point a with 0<|\varphi '(a)|< 1, the iterates, \varphi_{n}, converge uniformly to a, and \psi is in H^{\infty}(\mathbb{D}) and continuous at a. We also give bounds and some computations when |a|=1 and \varphi '(a)=1 and, in addition, show that these symbols include all linear fractional \varphi that are hyperbolic and parabolic non-automorphisms. Finally, we use these results to eliminate possible weights \psi so that W_{\psi, \varphi} is seminormal.
