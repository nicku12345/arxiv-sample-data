We consider an \alpha-relaxed projection P_A^\alpha:H\to H given by P_A^\alpha(x)=\alpha P_A(x)+(1-\alpha)x where \alpha\in[0,1] and P_A is the projection onto a non-empty, convex and closed subset A of the real Hilbert space H. We characterise all the sets F\subset[0,1] such that for some non-empty, convex and closed subsets A_1,A_2,\dots,A_k\subset H the composition P_{A_k}^\alpha P_{A_{k-1}}^\alpha\dots P_{A_1}^\alpha has a fixed point iff \alpha\in F. It proves, that if \dim H\geq 3 and k\geq3 then the class of the derscribed above sets F of coefficients \alpha is exactly the class of F_\sigma subsets of [0,1] containing 0.
