In this paper, we characterize the weighted local Hardy spaces h^p_\rho(\omega) related to the critical radius function \rho and weights \omega\in A_{1}^{\rho,\,\infty}(\mathbb{R}^{n}) by localized Riesz transforms \widehat{R}_j, in addition, we give a characterization of weighted Hardy spaces H^{1}_{\cal L}(\omega) via Riesz tranforms associated to Schr\"{o}dinger operator \cal L, where \L=-\Delta+V is a Schr\"{o}dinger operator on \mathbb{R}^{n} (n\ge 3) and V is a nonnegative function satisfying the reverse H\"older inequality.
