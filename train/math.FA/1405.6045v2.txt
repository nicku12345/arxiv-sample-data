We consider generalized Orlicz-Morrey spaces M_{\Phi,\varphi}(\mathbb{R}^{n}) including their weak versions WM_{\Phi,\varphi}(\mathbb{R}^{n}). We find the sufficient conditions on the pairs (\varphi_{1},\varphi_{2}) and (\Phi, \Psi) which ensures the boundedness of the fractional maximal operator M_{\alpha} from M_{\Phi,\varphi_1}(\mathbb{R}^{n}) to M_{\Psi,\varphi_2}(\mathbb{R}^{n}) and from M_{\Phi,\varphi_1}(\mathbb{R}^{n}) to WM_{\Psi,\varphi_2}(\mathbb{R}^{n}). As applications of those results, the boundedness of the commutators of the fractional maximal operator M_{b,\alpha} with b \in BMO(\mathbb{R}^{n}) on the spaces M_{\Phi,\varphi}(\mathbb{R}^{n}) is also obtained. In all the cases the conditions for the boundedness are given in terms of supremal-type inequalities on weights \varphi(x,r), which do not assume any assumption on monotonicity of \varphi(x,r) on r.
