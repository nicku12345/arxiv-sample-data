Several versions of the Fourier transform have been formulated in the framework of Clifford algebra. We present a (Clifford-Fourier) transform, constructed using the geometric properties of Clifford algebra. We show the corresponding results of operational calculus. We obtain a technique to construct monogenic extensions of a certain type of continuous functions, and versions of the Paley-Wiener theorems are formulated.
