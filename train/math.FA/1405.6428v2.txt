We provide a version for operators of the Bishop-Phelps-Bollob\'{a}s Theorem when the domain space is the complex space C_0(L). In fact we prove that the pair (C_0(L), Y) satisfies the Bishop-Phelps-Bollob\'{a}s property for operators for every Hausdorff locally compact space L and any \mathbb{C}-uniformly convex space. As a consequence, this holds for Y= L_p (\mu) (1 \le p < \infty ).
