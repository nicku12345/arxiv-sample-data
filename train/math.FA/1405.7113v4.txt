This work creates two categories of "array-weighted sets" for the purposes of constructing universal matrix-normed spaces and algebras. These universal objects have the analogous universal property to the free vector space, lifting maps completely bounded on a generation set to a completely bounded linear map of the matrix-normed space.   Moreover, the universal matrix-normed algebra is used to prove the existence of a free product for matrix-normed algebras using algebraic methods.
