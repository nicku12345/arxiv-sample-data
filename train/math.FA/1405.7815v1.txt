In this paper we study some basic properties of bicomplex linear operators on bicomplex Hilbert spaces. Further we discuss some applications of Hahn-Banach theorem on bicomplex Banach modules. We also introduce and discuss some bicomplex holomorphic function spaces and prove Littlewood's Subordination principle for bicomplex Hardy space.
