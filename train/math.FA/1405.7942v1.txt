In the paper, the equivalence of the functional inequality \|2f(x)+f(y)+f(-y)-f(x-y)\|\leq\|f(x+y)\|\;\;\;(x,y\in{G}) and the Drygas functional equation f(x+y)+f(x-y)=2f(x)+f(y)+f(-y)\;\;\;(x,y\in{G}) is proved for functions f:G\rightarrow E where (G, +) is an abelian group, (E, <\cdot, \cdot>) is an inner product space, and the norm is derived from the inner product in the usual way.
