Approximation properties of the expansions \sum_{k\in{\mathbb z}^d}c_k\phi(M^jx+k), where M is a matrix dilation, c_k is either the sampled value of a signal f at M^{-j}k or the integral average of f near M^{-j}k (falsified sampled value), are studied. Error estimations in L_p-norm, 2\le p\le\infty, are given in terms of the Fourier transform of f. The approximation order depends on how smooth is f, on the order of Strang-Fix condition for \phi and on M. Some special properties of \phi are   required. To estimate the approximation order of falsified sampling expansions we compare them with a differential expansions \sum_{k\in\,{\mathbb z}^d} Lf(M^{-j}\cdot)(-k)\phi(M^jx+k), where L is an appropriate differential operator. Some concrete functions \phi applicable for implementations are constructed. In particular, compactly supported splines and band-limited functions can be taken as \phi. Some of these functions provide expansions interpolating a signal at the points M^{-j}k.
