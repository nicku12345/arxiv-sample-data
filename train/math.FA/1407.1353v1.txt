We study the properties of rectangular constant  \mu(\mathbb{X})  in a normed linear space \mathbb{X}. We prove that  \mu(\mathbb{X}) = 3 iff the unit sphere contains a straight line segment of length 2. In fact, we prove that the rectangular modulus attains its upper bound iff the unit sphere contains a straight line segment of length 2.   We prove that if the dimension of the space \mathbb{X} is finite then \mu(\mathbb{X}) is attained. We also prove that a normed linear space is an inner product space iff we have sup\{\frac{1+|t|}{\|y+tx\|}: x,y \in S_{\mathbb{X}} with x\bot_By\} \leq \sqrt{2} \forall t satisfying |t|\in (3-2\sqrt{2},\sqrt{2}+1).
