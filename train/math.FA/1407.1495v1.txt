In this paper we consider a question on existence of double series by generalized Walsh system, which are universal in weighted L_\mu^1[0,1]^2 spaces. In particular, we construct a weighted function \mu(x,y) and a double series by generalized Walsh system of the form \sum_{n,k=1}^\infty c_{n,k}\psi_n(x)\psi_k(y)\ \ \mbox{with} \ \ \sum_{n,k=1}^\infty \left | c_{n,k} \right|^q <\infty\ \mbox{for all}\ q>2, which is universal in L_\mu^1[0,1]^2 concerning subseries with respect to convergence, in the sense of both spherical and rectangular partial sums.
