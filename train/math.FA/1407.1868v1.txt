In this paper first we describe all (not necessarily linear or bijective) transformations on \mathbb{R}^d with 2\leq d<\infty which preserve the area of parallelograms spanned by any two vectors. We also characterize those (not necessarily linear) bijections on an arbitrary real Hilbert space that preserve the latter quantity. This answers a question raised by Rassias and Wagner, and it can be considered as a variant of the famous Wigner theorem on real Hilbert spaces which plays an important role in quantum mechanics. As a consequence, we solve a preserver problem of Moln\'ar and Timmermann which has remained open stubbornly only in the two-dimensional case. Finally this two-dimensional result will be applied in order to strengthen their theorem in higher dimensions.
