For approximation numbers a_n (C_\phi) of composition operators C_\phi on weighted analytic Hilbert spaces, including the Hardy, Bergman and Dirichlet cases, with symbol \phi of uniform norm < 1, we prove that \lim_{n \to \infty} [a_n (C_\phi)]^{1/n} = \e^{- 1/ \capa [\phi (\D)]}, where \capa [\phi (\D)] is the Green capacity of \phi (\D) in \D. This formula holds also for H^p with 1 \leq p < \infty.
