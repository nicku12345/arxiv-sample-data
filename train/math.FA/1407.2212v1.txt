Let (g_i)_{i=1}^M be a family of contractive similitudes satisfying the open set condition. Let \nu be a self-similar measure associated with (g_i)_{i=1}^M. We study the quantization problem for the in-homogeneous self-similar measure \mu associated with a condensation system ((f_i)_{i=1}^N,(p_i)_{i=0}^N,\nu). Assuming a version of in-homogeneous open set condition for this system, we prove the existence of the quantization dimension for \mu of order r\in(0,\infty) and determine its exact value \xi_r. We give sufficient conditions for the \xi_r-dimensional upper and lower quantization coefficient to be positive or finite.
