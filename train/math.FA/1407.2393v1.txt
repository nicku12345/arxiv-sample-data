This thesis is devoted to the study of multivariate (joint) spectral multipliers for systems of strongly commuting non-negative self-adjoint operators, L=(L_1,\ldots,L_d), on L^2(X,\nu), where (X,\nu) is a measure space. By strong commutativity we mean that the operators L_r, r=1,\ldots,d, admit a joint spectral resolution E(\lambda). In that case, for a bounded function m\colon [0,\infty)^d\to \mathbb{C}, the multiplier operator m(L) is defined on L^2(X,\nu) by   m(L)=\int_{[0,\infty)^d}m(\lambda)dE(\lambda).   By spectral theory, m(L) is then bounded on L^2(X,\nu). The purpose of the dissertation is to investigate under which assumptions on the multiplier function m it is possible to extend m(L) to a bounded operator on L^p(X,\nu), 1<p<\infty.   The crucial assumption we make is the L^p(X,\nu), 1\leq p\leq \infty, contractivity of the heat semigroups corresponding to the operators L_r, r=1,\ldots,d. Under this assumption we generalize the results of [S. Meda, Proc. Amer. Math. Soc. 1990] to systems of strongly commuting operators. As an application we derive various multivariate multiplier theorems for particular systems of operators acting on separate variables. These include e.g. Ornstein-Uhlenbeck, Hermite, Laguerre, Bessel, Jacobi, and Dunkl operators. In some particular cases, we obtain presumably sharp results. Additionally, we demonstrate how a (bounded) holomorphic functional calculus for a pair of commuting operators, is useful in the study of dimension free boundedness of various Riesz transforms.
