On \mathbb{R}^d_+, endowed with the Laguerre probability measure \mu_\alpha, we define a Hodge-Laguerre operator \mathbb{L}_\alpha=\delta\delta^*+\delta^* \delta acting on differential forms. Here \delta is the Laguerre exterior differentiation operator, defined as the classical exterior differential, except that the partial derivatives \partial_{x_i} are replaced by the "Laguerre derivatives" \sqrt{x_i}\partial_{x_i}, and \delta^* is the adjoint of \delta with respect to inner product on forms defined by the Euclidean structure and the Laguerre measure \mu_\alpha. We prove dimension-free bounds on L^p, 1<p<\infty, for the Riesz transforms \delta \mathbb{L}_\alpha^{-1/2} and \delta^* \mathbb{L}_ \alpha^{-1/2}. As applications we prove the strong Hodge-de Rahm-Kodaira decomposition for forms in L^p and deduce existence and regularity results for the solutions of the Hodge and de Rham equations in L^p. We also prove that for suitable functions m the operator m(\mathbb{L}^\alpha) is bounded on L^p, 1<p<\infty.
