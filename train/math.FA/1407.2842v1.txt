It is well known, as follows from the Banach-Steinhaus theorem, that if a sequence \left\{y_{n}\right\}_{n=1}^{\infty} of linear continuous functionals in a Fr\'echet space converges pointwise to a linear functional Y, Y\left( x\right) =\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\left\langle y_{n},x\right\rangle  for all x, then Y is actually continuous. In this article we prove that in a Fr\'echet space the continuity of Y still holds if Y is the \emph{finite part} of the limit of \left\langle y_{n},x\right\rangle  as n\rightarrow\infty. We also show that the continuity of finite part limits holds for other classes of topological vector spaces, such as LF-spaces, DFS-spaces, and DFS^{\ast}-spaces, and give examples where it does not hold.
