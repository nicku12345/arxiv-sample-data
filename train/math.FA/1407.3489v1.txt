First we study in detail the tensorization properties of weak gradients in metric measure spaces (X,d,m). Then, we compare potentially different notions of Sobolev space H^{1,1}(X,d,m) and of weak gradient with exponent 1. Eventually we apply these results to compare the area functional \int\sqrt{1+|\nabla f|_w^2}\,dm with the perimeter of the subgraph of f, in the same spirit as the classical theory.
