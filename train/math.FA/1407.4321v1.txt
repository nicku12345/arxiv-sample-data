Time-frequency localization operators are a quantization procedure that maps symbols on R^{2d} to operators and depends on two window functions. We study the range of this quantization and its dependence on the window functions. If the short-time Fourier transform of the windows does not have any zero, then the range is dense in the Schatten p-classes. The main tool is new version of the Berezin transform associated to operators on L^2(R^d). Although some results are analogous to results about Toeplitz operators on spaces of holomorphic functions, the absence of a complex structure requires the development of new methods that are based on time-frequency analysis.
