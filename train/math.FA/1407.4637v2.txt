Frequent hypercyclicity for translation C_0-semigroups on weighted spaces of continuous functions is investigated. The results are achieved by establishing an analogy between frequent hypercyclicity for the translation semigroup and for weighted pseudo-shifts and by characterizing frequent hypercyclic weighted pseudo-shifts in spaces of vanishing sequences. Frequent hypercylic translation semigroups in weighted L^p-spaces are also characterized.
