In this paper we study the chaotic behaviour of the heat semigroup generated by the Dunkl-Laplacian on weighted  L^p spaces. In the case of the heat semigroup associated to the standard Laplacian we obtain a complete picture on the spaces  L^p(\R^n, (\varphi_{i\rho}(x))^2 dx)  where  \varphi_{i\rho}  is the Euclidean spherical function. The behaviour is very similar to the case of the Laplace-Beltrami operator on non-compact Riemannian symmetric spaces studied by Pramanik and Sarkar.
