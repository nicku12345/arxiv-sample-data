Let \sigma(A), \rho(A) and r(A) denote the spectrum, spectral radius and numerical radius of a bounded linear operator A on a Hilbert space H, respectively. We show that a linear operator A satisfying \rho(AB)\le r(A)r(B) \quad\text{ for all bounded linear operators } B if and only if there is a unique \mu \in \sigma (A) satisfying |\mu| = \rho(A) and A = \frac{\mu(I + L)}{2} for a contraction L with 1\in\sigma(L). One can get the same conclusion on A if \rho(AB) \le r(A)r(B) for all rank one operators B. If H is of finite dimension, we can further decompose L as a direct sum of C \oplus 0 under a suitable choice of orthonormal basis so that Re(C^{-1}x,x) \ge 1 for all unit vector x.
