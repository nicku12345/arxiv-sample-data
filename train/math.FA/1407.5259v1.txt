The aim of this article is to study a number of relationship between Frechet algebra \mathcal{A} and its ultrapower (\mathcal{A})_{\mathcal{U}}. We give a characterization in some aspects such as locally bounded approximate identity. We consider the notion of contractibility of ultrapower of Frechet algebra, and we show that if (\mathcal{A})_{\mathcal{U}} has approximation property with good ultrafilter \mathcal{U} then \mathcal{A} is contractible if and only if (\mathcal{A})_{\mathcal{U}} is contractible.
