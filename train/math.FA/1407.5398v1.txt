We consider general (not necessarily Hamiltonian) first-order symmetric system J y'-B(t)y=\D(t) f(t) on an interval \cI=[a,b)  with the regular endpoint a. A distribution matrix-valued function \Si(s), \; s\in\bR, is called a spectral (pseudospectral) function of such a system if the corresponding Fourier transform is an isometry (resp. partial isometry) from \LI into L^2(\Si). The main result is a parametrization of all spectral and pseudospectral functions of a given system by means of a Nevanlinna boundary parameter \tau. Similar parameterizations for various classes of boundary problems have earlier been obtained by Kac and Krein, Fulton, Langer and Textorius, Sakhnovich and others.
