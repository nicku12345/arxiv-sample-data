Using upper \ell_p-estimates for normalized weakly null sequence images, we describe a new family of operator ideals \mathcal{WD}_{\ell_p}^{(\infty,\xi)} with parameters 1\leq p\leq\infty and 1\leq\xi\leq\omega_1. These classes contain the completely continuous operators, and are distinct for all choices 1\leq p\leq\infty and, when p\neq 1, for all choices \xi\neq\omega_1. For the case \xi=1, there exists an ideal norm \|\cdot\|_{(p,1)} on the class \mathcal{WD}_{\ell_p}^{(\infty,1)} under which it forms a Banach ideal.
