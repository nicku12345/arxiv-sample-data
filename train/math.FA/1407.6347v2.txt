Given an inner function \Theta in the unit disc \mathbb{D}, we study the boundedness of the differentiation operator which acts from from the model subspace K\_{\Theta}=\left(\Theta H^{2}\right)^{\perp} of the Hardy space H^{2}, equiped with the BMOA-norm, to some radial-weighted Bergman space. As an application, we generalize Peller's inequality for Besov norms of rational functions f of degree n\geq1 having no poles in the closed unit disc \overline{\mathbb{D}}.
