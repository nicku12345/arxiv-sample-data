In this paper it is proved that each densely defined J-skew-symmetric operator (or each J-isometric operator with \overline{D(A)}=\overline{R(A)}=H) in a Hilbert space H has a J-skew-self-adjoint (respectively J-unitary) extension in a Hilbert space \widetilde H\supseteq H. We follow the ideas of Galindo in~[A.~Galindo, On the existence of J-self-adjoint extensions of J-symmetric operators with adjoint, Communications on pure and applied mathematics, Vol. XV, 423-425 (1962)] with necessary modifications.
