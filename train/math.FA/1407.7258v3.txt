We provide conditions for a linear map of the form C_{R,T}(S)=RST to be q-frequently hypercyclic on algebras of operators on separable Banach spaces. In particular, if R is a bounded operator satisfying the q-Frequent Hypercyclicity Criterion, then the map C_{R}(S)=RSR^* is shown to be q-frequently hypercyclic on the space \mathcal{K}(H) of all compact operators and the real topological vector space \mathcal{S}(H) of all self-adjoint operators on a separable Hilbert space H. Further we provide a condition for C_{R,T} to be q-frequently hypercyclic on the Schatten von Neumann classes S_p(H). We also characterize frequent hypercyclicity of C_{M^*_\varphi,M_\psi} on the trace-class of the Hardy space, where the symbol M_\varphi denotes the multiplication operator associated to \varphi.
