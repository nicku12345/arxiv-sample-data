We introduce q-frequently hypercyclic operators and derive a sufficient criterion for a continuous operator to be q-frequently hypercyclic on a locally convex space. Applications are given to obtain q-frequently hypercyclic operators with respect to the norm-, F-norm- and weak*- topologies. Finally, the frequent hypercyclicity of the non-convolution operator T_\mu defined by T_\mu(f)(z) = f'(\mu z), \mu\ge1 on the space H(\mathbb{C}) of entire functions equipped with the compact-open topology is shown.
