For pointed compact metric spaces (X,d), we address the biduality problem as to when the space of Lipschitz functions \mathrm{Lip}_0(X,d) is isometrically isomorphic to the bidual of the space of little Lipschitz functions \mathrm{lip}_0(X,d), and show that this is the case whenever the closed unit ball of \mathrm{lip}_0(X,d) is dense in the closed unit ball of \mathrm{Lip}_0(X,d) with respect to the topology of pointwise convergence. Then we apply our density criterion to prove in an alternate way the real version of a classical result which asserts that \mathrm{Lip}_0(X,d^\alpha) is isometrically isomorphic to \mathrm{lip}_0(X,d^\alpha)^{**} for any \alpha in (0,1).
