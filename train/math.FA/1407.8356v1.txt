We prove that for any weight \phi defined on [0,1]^n that satisfies a reverse Holder inequality with exponent p > 1 and constant c\ge1 upon all dyadic subcubes of [0,1]^n, it's non increasing rearrangement satisfies a reverse Holder inequality with the same exponent and constant not more than 2^nc-2^n + 1, upon all subintervals of [0; 1] of the form [0; t]. This gives as a consequence, according to the results in [8], an interval [p; p_0(p; c)) = I{p,c}, such that for any q \in I{p,c}, we have that \phi is in L^q.
