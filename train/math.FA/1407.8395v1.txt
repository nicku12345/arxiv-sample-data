This paper is devoted to the study of L^p-maximal regularity for non-autonomous linear evolution equations of the form \begin{equation*}\label{Multi-pert1-diss-non}   \dot u(t)+A(t)B(t)u(t)=f(t)\ \ t\in[0,T],\ \   u(0)=u_0.   \end{equation*} where \{A(t),\ t\in [0,T]\} is a family of linear unbounded operators whereas the operators \{B(t),\ t\in [0,T]\} are bounded and invertible. In the Hilbert space situation we consider operators A(t), \ t\in[0,T], which arise from sesquilinear forms. The obtained results are applied to parabolic linear differential equations in one spatial dimension.
