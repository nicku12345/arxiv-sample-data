For any symmetry group H and any appropriate matrix dilation we give an explicit method for the construction of H-symmetric refinable interpolatory refinable masks which satisfy sum rule of arbitrary order n. For each such mask we give an explicit technique for the construction of dual wavelet frames such that the corresponding wavelet masks are mutually symmetric and have the vanishing moments up to the order n. For an abelian symmetry group H we modify the technique such that each constructed wavelet mask is H-symmetric.
