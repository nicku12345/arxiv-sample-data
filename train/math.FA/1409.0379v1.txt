We show that a domain is an extension domain for a Haj\l asz-Besov or for a Haj\l asz-Triebel-Lizorkin space if and only if it satisfies a measure density condition. We use a modification of the Whitney extension where integral averages are replaced by median values, which allows us to handle also the case 0<p<1. The necessity of the measure density condition is derived from embedding theorems; in the case of Haj\l asz-Besov spaces we apply an optimal Lorentz-type Sobolev embedding theorem which we prove using a new interpolation result. This interpolation theorem says that Haj\l asz-Besov spaces are intermediate spaces between L^p and Haj\l asz-Sobolev spaces. Our results are proved in the setting of a metric measure space, but most of them are new even in the Euclidean setting, for instance, we obtain a characterization of extension domains for classical Besov spaces B^s_{p,q}, 0<s<1, 0<p<\infty, 0<q\le\infty, defined via the L^p-modulus of smoothness of a function.
