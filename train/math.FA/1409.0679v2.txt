We reduce the boundedness of operators in Morrey spaces L_p^r({\mathbb R}^n), its preduals, H^{\varrho}L_p ({\mathbb R}^n), and their preduals \overset{\circ}{L}{}^r_p({\mathbb R}^n) to the boundedness of the appropriate operators in Lebesgue spaces, L_p({\mathbb R}^n). Hereby, we need a weak condition with respect to the operators which is satisfied for a large set of classical operators of harmonic analysis including singular integral operators and the Hardy-Littlewood maximal function. The given vector-valued consideration of these issues is a key ingredient for various applications in harmonic analysis.
