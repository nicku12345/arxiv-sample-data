We say that two operators A, B have the range additivity property if R(A + B) = R(A) + R(B). In this article we study the relationship between range additivity, shorted operator and certain Hilbert space decomposition known as compatibility. As an application, we extend to infinite dimensional Hilbert space operators a formula by Fill and Fishkind related to the well-known Sherman-Morrison-Woodbury formula.
