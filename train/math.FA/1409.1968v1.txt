In this paper we prove three power-exponential inequalities for positive real numbers. In particular, we conclude that this proofs give affirmatively answers to three, until now, open problems (conjectures~4.4, 2.1 and 2.2) posed by C{\^i}rtoaje in the following two works:   "{\it J. Inequal. Pure Appl. Math.} 10, Article 21, 2009" and "{\it J. Nonlinear Sci. Appl.} 4:2:130-137, 2011". Moreover, we present a new proof of the inequality a^{ra}+b^{rb}\ge a^{rb}+b^{ra} for all positive real numbers a and b and r\in [0,e]. In addition, three new conjectures are presented.
