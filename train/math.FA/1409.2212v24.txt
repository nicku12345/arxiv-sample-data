A new class of symbols is investigated. These symbols satisfy a differential inequality which has a mixture of homogeneities on the product space. We show that pseudo differential operators with symbols of order zero in the class are L^p -bounded for 1 < p < infinity. Moreover, they form an algebra under compositions.
