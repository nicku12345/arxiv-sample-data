A sequence \{T_n\}_{n=1}^{\infty} of bounded linear operators between separable Banach spaces X, Y is called diskcyclic if there exists a vector x\in X such that the disk-scaled orbit \{\alpha T_n x: n\in \mathbb{N}, \alpha \in\mathbb{C}, | \alpha | \leq 1\} is dense in Y. In the first section of this paper we study some conditions that imply the diskcyclicity of \{T_n\}_{n=1}^{\infty}. In particular, a sequence \{T_n\}_{n=1}^{\infty} of bounded linear operators on separable infinite dimensional Hilbert space \mathcal{H} is called subspace-diskcyclic with respect to the closed subspace M\subseteq \mathcal{H}, if there exists a vector x\in \mathcal{H} such that the disk-scaled orbit \{\alpha T_n x: n\in \mathbb{N}, \alpha \in\mathbb{C}, | \alpha | \leq 1\}\cap M is dense in M. In the second section we survey some conditions and subspace-diskcyclicity criterion (analogue the results obtained by the some mathematicians in \cite{MR2261697, MR2720700, MR1111569}) which are sufficient for the sequence \{T_n\}_{n=1}^{\infty} to be subspace-diskcyclic.
