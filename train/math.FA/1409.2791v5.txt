We will give a complete description of \mathcal{I}, the set of invertible quasicontinuous functions on the unit circle. After doing this, we will then classify the path-connected components of \mathcal{I} and show that \mathcal{I} has uncountably many path-connected components. We will then use the above classifications to characterize \mathcal{F}, the set of Fredholm operators of the C^*-algebra generated by the Toeplitz operators T_\phi with quasicontinuous symbols \phi. Then we will classify the path-connected components of \mathcal{F} and show that \mathcal{F} also has uncountably many path-connected components.
