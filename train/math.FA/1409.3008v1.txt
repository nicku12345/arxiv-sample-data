This paper deals with the \emph{Bishop-Phelps-Bollob\'as property} (\emph{BPBp} for short) on bounded closed convex subsets of a Banach space X, not just on its closed unit ball B_X. We firstly prove that the \emph{BPBp} holds for bounded linear functionals on arbitrary bounded closed convex subsets of a real Banach space. We show that for all finite dimensional Banach spaces X and Y the pair (X,Y) has the \emph{BPBp} on every bounded closed convex subset D of X, and also that for a Banach space Y with property (\beta) the pair (X,Y) has the \emph{BPBp} on every bounded closed absolutely convex subset D of an arbitrary Banach space X. For a bounded closed absorbing convex subset D of X with positive modulus convexity we get that the pair (X,Y) has the \emph{BPBp} on D for every Banach space Y. We further obtain that for an Asplund space X and for a locally compact Hausdorff L, the pair (X, C_0(L)) has the \emph{BPBp} on every bounded closed absolutely convex subset D of X. Finally we study the stability of the \emph{BPBp} on a bounded closed convex set for the \ell_1-sum or \ell_{\infty}-sum of a family of Banach spaces.
