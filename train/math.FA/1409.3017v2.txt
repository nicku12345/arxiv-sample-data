For \alpha \in \mathbb{R}, let \mathscr{D}_\alpha denote the scale of Hilbert spaces consisting of Dirichlet series f(s) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n n^{-s} that satisfy \sum_{n=1}^\infty |a_n|^2/[d(n)]^\alpha < \infty. The Gordon--Hedenmalm Theorem on composition operators for \mathscr{H}^2=\mathscr{D}_0 is extended to the Bergman case \alpha>0. These composition operators are generated by functions of the form \Phi(s) = c_0 s + \varphi(s), where c_0 is a nonnegative integer and \varphi(s) is a Dirichlet series with certain convergence and mapping properties. For the operators with c_0=0 a new phenomenon is discovered: If 0 < \alpha < 1, the space \mathscr{D}_\alpha is mapped by the composition operator into a smaller space in the same scale. When \alpha > 1, the space \mathscr{D}_\alpha is mapped into a larger space in the same scale. Moreover, a partial description of the composition operators on the Dirichlet--Bergman spaces \mathscr{A}^p for 1 \leq p < \infty are obtained, in addition to new partial results for composition operators on the Dirichlet--Hardy spaces \mathscr{H}^p when p is an odd integer.
