Ortega-Cerd\`a -- Seip demonstrated that there are bounded multiplicative Hankel forms which do not arise from bounded symbols. On the other hand, when such a form is in the Hilbert-Schmidt class \mathcal{S}_2, Helson showed that it has a bounded symbol. The present work investigates forms belonging to the Schatten classes between these two cases. It is shown that for every p>(1-\log{\pi}/\log{4})^{-1} there exist multiplicative Hankel forms in the Schatten class \mathcal{S}_p which lack bounded symbols. The lower bound on p is in a certain sense optimal when the symbol of the multiplicative Hankel form is a product of homogeneous linear polynomials.
