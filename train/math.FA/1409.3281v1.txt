In this article, we estimate the essential norm of weighted composition operator W_{u, \varphi}, acting on the logarithmic Bloch space \mathcal{B}^{v_{\log}}, in terms of the n-power of the analytic function \varphi and the norm of the n-power of the identity function. Also, we estimate the essential norm of the weighted composition operator from \mathcal{B}^{v_{\log}} into the growth space H_{v_{\log}}^{\infty}. As a consequence of our result, we estimate the essential norm of the composition operator C_\varphi acting on the Logarithmic-Zygmund space.
