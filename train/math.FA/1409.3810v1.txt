We remark that a dyadic version of the Carleson embedding theorem for the Bergman space extends to vector-valued functions and operator-valued measures. This is in contrast to a result by Nazarov, Treil, Volberg in the context of the Hardy space. We also discuss some embeddings for analytic vector-valued functions.
