Let (X, Y) be a suitable couple of quasi-Banach lattices of measurable functions on \mathbb T \times \Omega, and let (X_A, Y_A) be the couple of the corresponding Hardy-type spaces. It has long been suspected that the BMO-regularity property of (X, Y) is not only sufficient for the \mathrm K-closedness of (X_A, Y_A) in (X, Y) but also necessary. We establish the equivalence of these two properties for a general couple of Banach lattices having the Fatou property when \Omega is a discrete measurable space, and also for couples (X, Y) where X is allowed to be quasi-Banach but Y is assumed to be p-convex with some p > 1 (here \Omega is arbitrary). We show under certain mild restrictions that the "good interpolation" formula  \left(X_A, \mathrm H_q\right)_{\theta, p} = \left[\left(X, \mathrm L_q\right)_{\theta, p}\right]_A  holds true if and only if X is BMO-regular.
