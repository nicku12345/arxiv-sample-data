We introduce and study a number of new spaces of ultradifferentiable functions and ultradistributions and we apply our results to the study of the convolution of ultradistributions. The spaces of convolutors \mathcal{O}'^{\ast}_{C}(\mathbb{R}^{d}) for tempered ultradistributions are analyzed via the duality with respect to the test function spaces \mathcal{O}^{\ast}_{C}(\mathbb{R}^{d}), introduced in this article. We also study ultradistribution spaces associated to translation-invariant Banach spaces of tempered ultradistributions and use their properties to provide a full characterization of the general convolution of Roumieu ultradistributions via the space of integrable ultradistributions. We show that the convolution of two Roumieu ultradistributions T,S\in \DD'^{\{M_p\}}\left(\RR^d\right) exists if and only if \left(\varphi*\check{S}\right)T\in\DD'^{\{M_p\}}_{L^1}\left(\RR^d\right) for every \varphi\in\DD^{\{M_p\}}\left(\RR^d\right).
