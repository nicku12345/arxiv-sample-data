The main goal of this work is to introduce an analogous in the non-archimedean context of the Gelfand spaces of certain Banach commutative algebras with unit. In order to do that, we study the spectrum of this algebras and we show that, under special conditions, these algebras are isometrically isomorphic to certain spaces of continuous functions defined over compacts. Such isometries preserve projections and allow to define associated measures which are known as spectral measures. We also show that each element of the algebras can be represented as an integral defined by these measures.
