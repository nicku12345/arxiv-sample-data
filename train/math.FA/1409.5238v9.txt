We consider a broad family of test function spaces and their dual (distribution) space. The family includes Gelfand-Shilov spaces, a family of test function spaces introduced by S. Pilipovic. We deduce different characterizations of such spaces, especially under the Bargmann transform and the Short-time Fourier transform. The family also include a test function space, whose dual space is mapped by the Bargmann transform bijectively to the set of entire functions.
