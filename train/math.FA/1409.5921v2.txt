We introduce the concept of weak-localization for generalized frames and use this concept to define a class of weakly localized operators. This class contains many important operators, including: Short Time Fourier Transform multipliers, Calderon-Toeplitz operators, Toeplitz operators on various functions spaces, Anti-Wick operators, and many others. In this paper, we study the boundedness and compactness of weakly localized operators. In particular, we provide a characterization of compactness for weakly localized operators in terms of the behavior of their Berezin transform.
