Some new trace inequalities for operators in Hilbert spaces are provided. The superadditivity and monotonicity of some associated functionals are investigated and applications for power series of such operators are given. Some trace inequalities for matrices are also derived. Examples for the operator exponential and other similar functions are presented as well.
