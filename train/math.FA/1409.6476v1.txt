Let 1\leq p < \infty and 1\leq r \leq p^\ast, where p^\ast is the conjugate index of p. We prove an omnibus theorem, which provides numerous equivalences for a sequence (x_n) in a Banach space X to be a (p,r)-null sequence. One of them is that (x_n) is (p,r)-null if and only if (x_n) is null and relatively (p,r)-compact. This equivalence is known in the "limit" case when r=p^\ast, the case of the p-null sequence and p-compactness. Our approach is more direct and easier than those applied for the proof of the latter result. We apply it also to characterize the unconditional and weak versions of (p,r)-null sequences.
