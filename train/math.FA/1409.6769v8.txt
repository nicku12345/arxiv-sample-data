This paper has two clear motivations: a technical and a practical. The technical motivation unifies in a single and crystal clear formulation a huge family of inequalities that have been produced separately in the last 90 years in different contexts. But we do not just join inequalities; our method also create a family of inequalities invisible by previous approaches. The practical motivation is to show that our deeper approach has strength to attack various problems. We provide new applications of our family of inequalities, continuing the recent work by Maia et al., that, by using our main theorem, substantially improved an inequality of Carando et al. which seemed impossible to be achieved by their original method.
