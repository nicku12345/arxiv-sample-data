Due to the fundamental works of T. Ando, W. Szyma\'nski, F. H. Szafraniec, and many others it is well known that sesquilinear forms play an important role in dilation theory. The crucial fact is that every positive definite operator function induces a sesquilinear form in a natural way. The purpose of this survey-like paper is to apply some recent results of Z. Sebesty\'en, Zs. Tarcsay, and the author for such functions. While most of the results are not new, the paper's main contribution is the unified discussion from the viewpoint of sesquilinear forms.
