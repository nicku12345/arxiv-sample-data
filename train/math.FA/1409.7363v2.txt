Let X, Y, and Z be topological modules over a topological ring R. In this paper, we introduce three different classes of bounded bigroup homomorphisms from X \times Y into Z with respect to the three different uniform convergence topologies. We show that the operations of addition and module multiplication are continuous for each class of bounded bigroup homomorphisms. Also, we investigate whether each class of bounded bigroup homomorphisms is uniformly complete.
