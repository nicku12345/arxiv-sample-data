In this paper we are going to investigate the approximate biprojectivity and the \phi-biflatness of some Banach algebras related to the locally compact groups. We show that a Segal algebra S(G) is approximate biprojective if and only if G is compact. Also for a continuous weight w\geq 1, we show that L^{1}(G,w) is a approximate biprojective if and only if G is compact. We study \phi-biflatness of some Banach algebras, where \phi:A\rightarrow \mathbb{C} is a multiplicative linear functional. We show that if S(G) is \phi-biflat, then G is amenable group. Also we show that the \phi-biflatness of L^{1}(G)^{**} implies the amenability of G.
