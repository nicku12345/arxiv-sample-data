In this paper, we investigate the notion of approximate biprojectivity for semigroup algebras and for some Banach algebras related to semigroup algebras. We show that \ell^{1}(S) is approximately biprojective if and only if \ell^{1}(S) is biprojective, provided that S is a uniformly locally finite inverse semigroup. Also for a Clifford semigroup S, we show that approximate biprojectivity \ell^{1}(S)^{**} gives pseudo amenability of \ell^{1}(S). We give a class of Banach algebras related to semigroup algebras which is not approximately biprojective.
