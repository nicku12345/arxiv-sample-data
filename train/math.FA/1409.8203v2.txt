We show that there exists a Banach space E with the following properties: the Banach algebra \mathscr{B}(E) of bounded, linear operators on E has a singular extension which splits algebraically, but it does not split strongly, and the homological bidimension of \mathscr{B}(E) is at least two. The first of these conclusions solves a natural problem left open by Bade, Dales, and Lykova (Mem. Amer. Math. Soc. 1999), while the second answers a question of Helemskii. The Banach space E that we use was originally introduced by Read (J. London Math. Soc. 1989).
