In this article we develop few of the analogous theoretical results of Clifford analysis over Orlicz-Sobolev spaces and study mapping properties of the Dirac operator and the Teodorescu transform over these function spaces. We also get analogous decomposition results of Clifford valued Orlicz spaces and the generalized Orlicz-Sobolev spaces.
