This paper is concerned with a boundedness of trace and extension operators for Besov spaces and Triebel-Lizorkin spaces on upper half space with variable exponents. To define trace and extension operators, we introduce a quarkonial decomposition for Besov spaces and Triebel-Lizorkin spaces with variable exponents on {\mathbb R}^n. Furthermore, we study trace and extension operators for Besov spaces and Triebel-Lizorkin spaces with variable exponents on upper half spaces {\mathbb R}^n_+.
