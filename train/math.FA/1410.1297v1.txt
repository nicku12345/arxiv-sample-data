Given a power-bounded operator T, the theorem of Katznelson and Tzafriri states that \|T^n(I-T)\|\to0 as n\to\infty if and only if the spectrum \sigma(T) of T intersects the unit circle \mathbb{T} in at most the point 1. This paper investigates the rate at which decay takes place when \sigma(T)\cap\mathbb{T}=\{1\}. The results obtained lead in particular to both upper and lower bounds on this rate of decay in terms of the growth of the resolvent operator R(\mathrm{e}^{\mathrm{i}\theta},T) as \theta\to0. In the special case of polynomial resolvent growth, these bounds are then shown to be optimal for general Banach spaces but not in the Hilbert space case.
