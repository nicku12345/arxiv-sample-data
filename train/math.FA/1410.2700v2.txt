In this paper, we give a brief review concerning diskcyclic operators and then we provide some further characterizations of diskcyclic operators on separable Hilbert spaces. In particular, we show that if x\in {\mathcal H} has a disk orbit under T that is somewhere dense in {\mathcal H} then the disk orbit of x under T need not be everywhere dense in {\mathcal H}. We also show that the inverse and the adjoint of a diskcyclic operator need not be diskcyclic. Moreover, we establish another diskcyclicity criterion and use it to find a necessary and sufficient condition for unilateral backward shifts that are diskcyclic operators. We show that a diskcyclic operator exists on a Hilbert space {\mathcal H} over the field of complex numbers if and only if \dim({\mathcal H})=1 or \dim({\mathcal H})=\infty . Finally we give a sufficient condition for the somewhere density disk orbit to be everywhere dense.
