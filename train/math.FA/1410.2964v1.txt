We shall consider a double infinite, hermitian, complex entry matrix A=[a_{x,y}]_{x,y\in\mathbb Z}, with a_{x,y}^*=a_{y,x}, x,y\in\mathbb Z. Assuming that the matrix is almost of a finite bandwidth, i.e. there exists an integer n> 0 and exponent \gamma\in[0,1) such that  a_{x,x+z}=0 for all z>n\langle x\rangle^{\gamma} and the growth of the \ell_1 norm of a row is slower than |x|^{1-\gamma} for |x|\gg1, i.e. \lim_{|x|\to+\infty}| x|^{\gamma-1}\sum_{y}|a_{xy}|=0 we prove that the corresponding symmetric operator, defined on compactly supported sequences, is essentially self-adjoint in \ell_2(\mathbb Z). In the case \gamma=0 (the so called (nJ)-matrices) we prove that there exists c_*>0, depending only on n, such that the condition \limsup_{|x|\to+\infty}| x|^{-1}\sum_{y}|a_{xy}|\le c_* suffices to conclude essential self-adjointness.
