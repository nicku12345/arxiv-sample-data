The Hardy--Littlewood inequality for complex homogeneous polynomials asserts that given positive integers m\geq2 and n\geq1, if P is a complex homogeneous polynomial of degree m on \ell_{p}^{n} with 2m\leq p\leq\infty given by P(x_{1},\ldots,x_{n})=\sum_{|\alpha|=m}a_{\alpha }\mathbf{{x}^{\alpha}}, then there exists a constant C_{\mathbb{C},m,p}^{\mathrm{pol}}\geq1 (which is does not depend on n) such that \[ \left( {\sum\limits_{\left\vert \alpha\right\vert =m}}\left\vert a_{\alpha }\right\vert ^{\frac{2mp}{mp+p-2m}}\right) ^{\frac{mp+p-2m}{2mp}}\leq C_{\mathbb{C},m,p}^{\mathrm{pol}}\left\Vert P\right\Vert , \] with \Vert P\Vert:=\sup_{z\in B_{\ell_{p}^{n}}}|P(z)|. In this short note, among other results, we provide nontrivial lower bounds for the constants C_{\mathbb{C},m,p}^{\mathrm{pol}}. For instance we prove that, for m\geq2 and 2m\leq p<\infty, \[ C_{\mathbb{C},m,p}^{\mathrm{pol}}\geq2^{\frac{m}{p}}% \] for m even, and \[ C_{\mathbb{C},m,p}^{\mathrm{pol}}\geq2^{\frac{m-1}{p}}% \] for m odd. Estimates for the case p=\infty (this is the particular case of the complex polynomial Bohnenblust--Hille inequality) were recently obtained by D. Nu\~nez-Alarc\'on in 2013.
