For each m\ge 1 and p>2 we characterize bounded simply connected Sobolev L^m_p-extension domains \Omega\subset R^2. Our criterion is expressed in terms of certain intrinsic subhyperbolic metrics in \Omega. Its proof is based on a series of results related to the existence of special chains of squares joining given points x and y in \Omega.   An important geometrical ingredient for obtaining these results is a new "Square Separation Theorem". It states that under certain natural assumptions on the relative positions of a point x and a square S\subset\Omega there exists a similar square Q\subset\Omega which touches S and has the property that x and S belong to distinct connected components of \Omega\setminus Q.
