The local equicontinuity of an operator T:X\rightrightarrows X^{*} with proper Fitzpatrick function \varphi_{T} and defined in a barreled locally convex space X has been shown to hold on the algebraic interior of \operatorname*{Pr}\,_{X}(\operatorname*{dom}\varphi_{T})). The current note presents direct consequences of the aforementioned result with regard to the local equicontinuity of a maximal monotone operator defined in a barreled locally convex space.
