We study when diameter two properties pass down to subspaces. We obtain that the slice two property (respectively diameter two property, strong diameter two property) passes down from a Banach space X to a subspace Y whenever Y is complemented by a norm one projection with finite-dimensional kernel (respectively the quotient X/Y is finite dimensional, X/Y is strongly regular). Also we study the same problem for dual properties of the above ones, as having octahedral, weakly octahedral or 2-rough norm.
