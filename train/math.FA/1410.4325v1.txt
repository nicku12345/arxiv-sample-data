We study the diameter two properties in the spaces JH, JT_\infty and JH_\infty. We show that the topological dual space of the previous Banach spaces fails every diameter two property. However, we prove that JH and JH_{\infty} satisfy the strong diameter two property, and so the dual norm of these spaces is octahedral. Also we find a closed hyperplane M of JH_\infty whose topological dual space enjoys the w^*-strong diameter two property and also M and M^* have an octahedral norm.
