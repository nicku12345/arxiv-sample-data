We give a Hahn-Banach Characterization for convex-cyclicity. We also obtain an example of a bounded linear operator S on a Banach space with \sigma_{p}(S^*)=\emptyset such that S is convex-cyclic, but S is not weakly hypercyclic and S^2  is not convex-cyclic. This solved two questions of Rezaei in \cite{Rezaei} when \sigma_p(S^*)=\varnothing. %Recently, Le\'on-Saavedra and Romero de la Rosa \cite{LeRo} provide an example of a convex-cyclic operator S such that the power S^n fails to be convex-cyclic with \sigma _p(S^*)\neq \varnothing. In fact they solved tree questions posed by Rezaei in \cite{Rezaei}. Moreover, we prove that m-isometries are not convex-cyclic and that \varepsilon-hypercyclic operators are convex-cyclic.   We also characterize the diagonalizable normal operators that are convex-cyclic and give a condition on the eigenvalues of an arbitrary operator for it to be convex-cyclic. We show that certain adjoint multiplication operators are convex-cyclic and show that some are convex-cyclic but no convex polynomial of the operator is hypercyclic. Also some adjoint multiplication operators are convex-cyclic but not 1-weakly hypercyclic.
