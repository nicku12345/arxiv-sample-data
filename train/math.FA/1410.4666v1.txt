We consider random sampling in finitely generated shift-invariant spaces V(\Phi) \subset {\rm L}^2(\mathbb{R}^n) generated by a vector \Phi = (\varphi_1,\ldots,\varphi_r) \in {\rm L}^2(\mathbb{R}^n)^r. Following the approach introduced by Bass and Gr\"ochenig, we consider certain relatively compact subsets V_{R,\delta}(\Phi) of such a space, defined in terms of a concentration inequality with respect to a cube with side lengths R. Under very mild assumptions on the generators, we show that for R sufficiently large, taking O(R^n log(R^{n^2/\alpha'})) many random samples (taken independently uniformly distributed within C_R) yields a sampling set for V_{R,\delta}(\Phi) with high probability. Here \alpha' \le n is a suitable constant.We give explicit estimates of all involved constants in terms of the generators \varphi_1, \ldots, \varphi_r.
