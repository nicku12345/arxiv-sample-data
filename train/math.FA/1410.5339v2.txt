In this paper, we prove some theorems related to properties of generalized symmetric hybrid mappings in Banach spaces. Using Banach limits, we prove a fixed point theorem for symmetric generalized hybrid mappings in Banach spaces. Moreover, we prove some weak convergence theorems for such mappings by using Ishikawa iteration method in a uniformly convex Banach space.
