We study completions of Archimedean vector lattices relative to any nonempty set of positively-homogeneous functions on finite-dimensional real vector spaces. Examples of such completions include square mean closed and geometric closed vector lattices, amongst others. These functional completions also lead to a universal definition of the complexification of any Archimedean vector lattice and a theory of tensor products and powers of complex vector lattices in a companion paper.
