Denote by M_n the set of n\times n complex matrices. Let f: M_n \rightarrow [0,\infty) be a continuous map such that f(\mu UAU^*)= f(A) for any complex unit \mu, A \in M_n and unitary U \in M_n, f(X)=0 if and only if X=0 and the induced map t \mapsto f(tX) is monotonic increasing on [0,\infty) for any rank 1 nilpotent X \in M_n. Characterizations are given for surjective maps \phi on M_n satisfying f(AB-BA) = f(\phi(A)\phi(B)-\phi(B)\phi(A)). The general theorem are then used to deduce results on special cases when the function is the pseudo spectrum and the pseudo spectral radius, that answers a question of Molnar raised at the 2014 CMS summer meeting.
