We give a few observations on different types of bounded operators on a topological vector space X and their relations with compact operators on X. In particular, we investigate when these bounded operators coincide with compact operators. We also consider similar types of bounded bilinear mappings between topological vector spaces. Some properties of tensor product operators between locally convex spaces are established. In the last part of the paper we deal with operators on topological Riesz spaces.
