Variational principles are proved for self-adjoint operator functions arising from variational evolution equations of the form \[   \langle\ddot{z}(t),y \rangle + \mathfrak{d}[\dot{z} (t), y] + \mathfrak{a}_0 [z(t),y] = 0. \] Here \mathfrak{a}_0 and \mathfrak{d} are densely defined, symmetric and positive sesquilinear forms on a Hilbert space H. We associate with the variational evolution equation an equivalent Cauchy problem corresponding to a block operator matrix \mathcal{A}, the forms \[   \mathfrak{t}(\lambda)[x,y] := \lambda^2\langle x,y\rangle + \lambda\mathfrak{d}[x,y] + \mathfrak{a}_0[x,y], \] where \lambda\in \mathbb C and x,y are in the domain of the form \mathfrak{a}_0, and a corresponding operator family T(\lambda). Using form methods we define a generalized Rayleigh functional and characterize the eigenvalues above the essential spectrum of \mathcal{A} by a min-max and a max-min variational principle. The obtained results are illustrated with a damped beam equation.
