For any bounded domain \Omega in \mathbb C^m, let {\mathrm B}_1(\Omega) denote the Cowen-Douglas class of commuting m-tuples of bounded linear operators. For an m-tuple \boldsymbol T in the Cowen-Douglas class {\mathrm B}_1(\Omega), let N_{\boldsymbol T}(w) denote the restriction of \boldsymbol T to the subspace {\cap_{i,j=1}^m\ker(T_i-w_iI)(T_j-w_jI)}. This commuting m-tuple N_{\boldsymbol T}(w) of m+1 dimensional operators induces a homomorphism \rho_{_{\!N_{\boldsymbol T}(w)}} of the polynomial ring P[z_1, ..., z_m], namely, \rho_{_{\!N_{\boldsymbol T}(w)}}(p) = p\big (N_{\boldsymbol T}(w) \big),\, p\in P[z_1, ..., z_m]. We study the contractivity and complete contractivity of the homomorphism \rho_{_{\!N_{\boldsymbol T}(w)}}. Starting from the homomorphism \rho_{_{\!N_{\boldsymbol T}(w)}}, we construct a natural class of homomorphism \rho_{_{\!N^{(\lambda)}(w)}}, \lambda>0, and relate the properties of \rho_{_{\!N^{(\lambda)}(w)}} to that of \rho_{_{\!N_{\boldsymbol T}(w)}}. Explicit examples arising from the multiplication operators on the Bergman space of \Omega are investigated in detail. Finally, it is shown that contractive properties of \rho_{_{\!N_{\boldsymbol T}(w)}} is equivalent to an inequality for the curvature of the Cowen-Douglas bundle E_{\boldsymbol T}.
