We generalize a result for the translation C_0-semigroup on L^p(\R_+,\mu) about the equivalence of being chaotic and satisfying the Frequent Hypercyclicity criterion due to Mangino and Peris to certain weighted composition C_0-semigroups. Such C_0-semigroups appear in a natural way when dealing with initial value problems for linear first order partial differential operators. We apply our result to the linear von Foerster-Lasota equation arising in mathematical biology. Weighted composition C_0-semigroups on Sobolev spaces are also considered.
