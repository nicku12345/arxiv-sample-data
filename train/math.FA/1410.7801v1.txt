The main aim of the present paper is to investigate various structural properties of hyperplanes of c, the Banach space of the convergent sequences. In particular, we give an explicit formula for the projection constants and we prove that an hyperplane of c is isometric to the whole space if and only if it is 1-complemented. Moreover, we obtain the classification of those hyperplanes for which their duals are isometric to \ell_{1} and we give a complete description of the preduals of \ell_{1} under the assumption that the standard basis of \ell_{1} is weak^{*}-convergent.
