We prove inequalities on symmetric tensor sums of positive definite operators. In particular, we prove multivariable operator inequalities inspired by generalizations to the well-known Hlawka and Popoviciu inequalities. As corollaries, we obtain generalized Hlawka and Popoviciu inequalities for determinants, permanents, and generalized matrix functions. The new operator inequalities and their corollaries contain a few recently published inequalities on positive definite matrices as special cases.
