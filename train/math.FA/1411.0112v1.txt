Let T be a homomorphism from a Banach algebra B to a Banach algebra A.The Cartesian product space A * B with T-Lau multiplication and l^1-norm becomes a new Banach algebra A *_T B. We investigate the notions such as approximate amenability, pseudo amenability, phi-pseudo amenability,phi-biflatness and phi-biprojectivity for Banach algebra A *_T B. We also present an example to show that approximate amenability of A and B is not stable for A *_T B. Finally we characterize the double centralizer algebra of A *_T B and present an application of this characterization.
