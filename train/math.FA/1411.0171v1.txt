Suppose that the linear operator T maps X_0 compactly to Y_0 and also maps X_1 boundedly to Y_1. We deal once again with the 51 year old question of whether T also always maps the complex interpolation space [X_0,X_1]_\theta compactly to [Y_0,Y_1]_\theta.   This is a short preliminary version of our promised technical sequel to our earlier paper arXiv:1410.4527 on this topic.   It contains the following two small new partial results:   (i) The answer to the above question is yes, in the particular case where Y_0 is a UMD-space.   (ii) The answer to the above question is yes for given spaces X_0, X_1, Y_0 and Y_1 if the answer to the "dualized" or "adjoint" version of the question for the duals of these particular spaces is yes.   In fact we deduce (i) from (ii) and from an earlier result obtained jointly by one of us with Nigel Kalton.   It is remarked that a proof of a natural converse of (ii) would answer the general form of this question completely.
