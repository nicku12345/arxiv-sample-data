We show that if X is a Banach space whose dual X^{*} has an equivalent locally uniformly rotund (LUR) norm, then for every open convex U\subseteq X, for every \varepsilon >0, and for every continuous and convex function f:U \rightarrow \mathbb{R} (not necessarily bounded on bounded sets) there exists a convex function g:X \rightarrow \mathbb{R} of class C^1(U) such that f-\varepsilon\leq g\leq f on U. We also show how the problem of global approximation of continuous (not necessarily bounded on bounded sets) and convex functions by C^k smooth convex functions can be reduced to the problem of global approximation of Lipschitz convex functions by C^k smooth convex functions.
