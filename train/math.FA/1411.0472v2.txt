Using notions from the geometry of Banach spaces we introduce square functions \gamma(\Omega,X) for functions with values in an arbitrary Banach space X. We show that they have very convenient function space properties comparable to the Bochner norm of L_2(\Omega,H) for a Hilbert space H. In particular all bounded operators T on H can be extended to \gamma(\Omega,X) for all Banach spaces X. Our main applications are characterizations of the H^{\infty}--calculus that extend known results for L_p--spaces from \cite{CowlingDoustMcIntoshYagi}. With these square function estimates we show, e. g., that a c_0--group of operators T_s on a Banach space with finite cotype has an H^{\infty}--calculus on a strip if and only if e^{-a|s|}T_s is R--bounded for some a > 0. Similarly, a sectorial operator A has an H^{\infty}--calculus on a sector if and only if A has R--bounded imaginary powers. We also consider vector valued Paley--Littlewood g--functions on UMD--spaces.
