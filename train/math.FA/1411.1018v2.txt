We make an exhaustive study of the properties of multiplication operator M_u acting on K\"othe spaces. We characterize the multiplication operators, acting on K\"othe spaces, which are: bounded, injective, onto, bijective, Fredholm, compact, with closed range and with range finite. We also study the spectrum, the n-power and calculate the essential norm of M_u and we study the algebra of multiplication operators.
