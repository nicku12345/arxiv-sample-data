Motivated by Bownik and Speegle's result on linear independence of wavelet Parseval frames, we consider affine systems (analogous to wavelet systems) defined on a second countable, locally compact abelian group G, where the translations are replaced by the action of a countable, discrete subgroup \Gamma of  G acting as a group of unitary operators on L^2(G). The dilation operation in the wavelet setting is replaced by integer powers of a unitary operator \delta onto L^2(G). We show that, under some compatibility conditions between \delta and the action of the group \Gamma, the linear independence of the translates of any function in L^2(G) by elements of \Gamma implies the linear independence of affine Parseval frames in L^2(G).
