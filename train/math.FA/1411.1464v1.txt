In a normed linear space X an element x is said to be orthogonal to another element y in the sense of Birkhoff-James, written as  x \perp_{B}y,  iff  \| x \| \leq \| x + \lambda y \|  for all scalars  \lambda. We prove that a normed linear space X is strictly convex iff for any two elements x, y of the unit sphere  S_X,  x \perp_{B}y  implies  \| x + \lambda y \| > 1~ \forall~ \lambda \neq 0.  We apply this result to find a necessary and sufficient condition for a Hamel basis to be a strongly orthonormal Hamel basis in the sense of Birkhoff-James in a finite dimensional real strictly convex space X. Applying the result we give an estimation for lower bounds of  \| tx+(1-t)y\|, t \in [0,1]  and  \| y + \lambda x \|, ~\forall ~\lambda  for all elements  x,y \in S_X  with  x \perp_B y.  We find a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of conjugate diameters through the points  e_1,e_2 \in ~S_X  in a real strictly convex space of dimension 2. The concept of generalized conjuagte diameters is then developed for a real strictly convex smooth space of finite dimension.
