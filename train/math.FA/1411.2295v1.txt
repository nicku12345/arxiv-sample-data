We extend the classical Lyapunov inequality on the measurable space with infinite measure and on the so-called Grand Lebesgue spaces (GLS).   We find also the exact value for correspondent constant.   Possible applications: Functional Analysis (for instance, interpolation of operators), Integral Equations, Probability Theory and Statistics (tail estimations for random variables) etc.
