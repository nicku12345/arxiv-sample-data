The space D'_\Lambda of distributions having their C^\infty wavefront set in a cone \Lambda has become important in physics because of its role in the formulation of quantum field theory in curved spacetime. It is also a basic object in microlocal analysis, but not well studied from a functional analytic viewpoint. In order to compute its completion in the open cone case, we introduce generalized spaces D'_{\gamma,\Lambda} where we also control the union of H^s-wave front sets in a second cone \gamma contained in \Lambda. We can compute bornological and topological duals, completions and bornologifications of natural topologies for spaces in this class. All our topologies are nuclear, ultrabornological when bornological and we can describe when they are quasi-LB. We also give concrete microlocal representations of bounded and equicontinuous sets in those spaces and work with general support conditions including future compact or space compact support conditions on globally hyperbolic manifolds, as motivated by physics applications to be developed in a second paper.
