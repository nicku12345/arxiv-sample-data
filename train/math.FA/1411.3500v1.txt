Frames and Bessel sequences in Fr\'echet spaces and their duals are defined and studied. Their relation with Schauder frames and representing systems is analyzed. The abstract results presented here, when applied to concrete spaces of analytic functions, give many examples and consequences about sampling sets and Dirichlet series expansions.
