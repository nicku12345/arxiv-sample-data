We consider frames in a finite-dimensional Hilbert space where frames are exactly the spanning sets of the vector space. A factor poset of a frame is defined to be a collection of subsets of I, the index set of our vectors, ordered by inclusion so that nonempty J \subseteq I is in the factor poset if and only if \{f_i\}_{i \in J} is a tight frame. We first study when a poset P\subseteq 2^I is a factor poset of a frame and then relate the two topics by discussing the connections between the factor posets of frames and their duals. Additionally we discuss duals with regard to \ell^p minimization.
