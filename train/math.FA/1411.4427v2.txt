The paper contains three results, the common feature of which is that they deal with the Schatten p class. The first is a presentation of a new complemented subspace of C_p in the reflexive range (and p\not= 2). This construction answers a question of Arazy and Lindestrauss from 1975. The second result relates to tight embeddings of finite dimensional subspaces of C_p in C_p^n with small n and shows that \ell_p^k nicely embeds into C_p^n only if n is at least proportional to k (and then of course the dimension of C_p^n is at least of order k^2). The third result concerns single element of C_p^n and shows that for p>2 any n\times n matrix of C_p norm one and zero diagonal admits, for every \varepsilon>0, a k-paving of C_p norm at most \varepsilon with k depending on \varepsilon and p only.
