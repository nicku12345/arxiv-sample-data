The \emph{relative projection constant} \lambda(Y, X) of normed spaces Y \subset X is defined as \lambda(Y, X) = \inf \{ ||P|| : P \in \mathcal{P}(X, Y) \}, where \mathcal{P}(X, Y) denotes the set of all continuous projections from X onto Y. By the well-known result of Bohnenblust for every n-dimensional normed space X and its subspace Y of codimension 1 the inequality \lambda(Y, X) \leq 2 - \frac{2}{n} holds. The main goal of the paper is to study the equality case in the theorem of Bohnenblust. We establish an equivalent condition for the equality \lambda(Y, X) = 2 - \frac{2}{n} and present several applications. We prove that every three-dimensional space has a subspace with the projection constant less than \frac{4}{3} - 0.0007. This gives a non-trivial upper bound in the problem posed by Bosznay and Garay. In the general case, we give an upper bound for the number of (n-1)-dimensional subspaces with the maximal relative projection constant in terms of the facets of the unit ball of X. As a consequence, every n-dimensional normed space X has an (n-1)-dimensional subspace Y with \lambda(Y, X) < 2-\frac{2}{n}. This contrasts with the seperable case in which it is possible that every hyperplane has a maximal possible projection constant.
