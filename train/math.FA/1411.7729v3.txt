Consider \mathscr{F} a non-empty set of subsets of \mathbb{N}. An operator T on X satisfies property \mathcal{P}_{\mathscr{F}} if for any U non-empty open set in X, there exists x\in X such that \{n\in\mathbb{N}: T^nx\in U\}\in \mathscr{F}. Let \overline{\mathcal{BD}} the collection of sets in \mathbb{N} with positive upper Banach density. Our main result is a characterization of sequence of operators satisfying property \mathcal{P}_{\overline{\mathcal{BD}}}, for which we have used a strong result of Bergelson and Mccutcheon in the vein of Szemer\'{e}di's theorem. It turns out that operators having property \mathcal{P}_{\overline{\mathcal{BD}}} satisfy a kind of recurrence described in terms of essential idempotents of \beta \mathbb{N}. We will also discuss the case of weighted backward shifts. Finally, we obtain a characterization of reiteratively hypercyclic operators.
