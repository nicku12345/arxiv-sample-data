In this article we construct a generalized Gaussian process coming from Coxeter groups of type B. It is given by creation and annihilation operators on an (\alpha,q)-Fock space, which satisfy the commutation relation  b_{\alpha,q}(x)b_{\alpha,q}^\ast(y)-qb_{\alpha,q}^\ast(y)b_{\alpha,q}(x)=\langle x, y\rangle I+\alpha\langle \overline{x}, y \rangle q^{2N},  where x,y are elements of a complex Hilbert space with a self-adjoint involution x\mapsto\bar{x} and N is the number operator with respect to the grading on the (\alpha,q)-Fock space. We give an estimate of the norms of creation operators. We show that the distribution of the operators b_{\alpha,q}(x)+b_{\alpha,q}^\ast(x) with respect to the vacuum expectation becomes a generalized Gaussian distribution, in the sense that all mixed moments can be calculated from the second moments with the help of a combinatorial formula related with set partitions. Our generalized Gaussian distribution associates the orthogonal polynomials called the q-Meixner-Pollaczek polynomials, yielding the q-Hermite polynomials when \alpha=0 and free Meixner polynomials when q=0.
