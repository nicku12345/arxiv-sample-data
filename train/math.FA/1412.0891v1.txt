In this study, we define new paranormed sequence spaces by combining a double sequential band matrix and a diagonal matrix. Furthermore, we compute the \alpha-,\beta- and \gamma- duals and obtain bases for these sequence spaces. Besides this, we characterize the matrix transformations from the new paranormed sequence spaces to the spaces c_{0}(q),c(q),\ell(q) and \ell_{\infty}(q). Finally, \alpha-core of a complex-valued sequence has been introduced, and we prove some inclusion theorems related to this new type of core.
