We start the systematic study of Fr\'{e}chet spaces which are \aleph-spaces in the weak topology. A topological space X is an \aleph_0-space or an \aleph-space if X has a countable k-network or a \sigma-locally finite k-network, respectively. We are motivated by the following result of Corson (1966): If the space C_{c}(X) of continuous real-valued functions on a Tychonoff space X endowed with the compact-open topology is a Banach space, then C_{c}(X) endowed with the weak topology is an \aleph_0-space if and only if X is countable. We extend Corson's result as follows: If the space E:=C_{c}(X) is a Fr\'echet lcs, then E endowed with its weak topology \sigma(E,E') is an \aleph-space if and only if (E,\sigma(E,E')) is an \aleph_0-space if and only if X is countable. We obtain a necessary and some sufficient conditions on a Fr\'echet lcs to be an \aleph-space in the weak topology. We prove that a reflexive Fr\'echet lcs E in the weak topology \sigma(E,E') is an \aleph-space if and only if (E,\sigma(E,E')) is an \aleph_0-space if and only if E is separable. We show however that the nonseparable Banach space \ell_{1}(\mathbb{R}) with the weak topology is an \aleph-space.
