We prove the existence of common hypercyclic entire functions for uncountable families of translation type operators. Contrary to our previous work [34], here the parameter which reflects the uncountable family lies on the unit circle. On the other hand the sequence of translations is in a sense less restrictive if it is to be compared with the corresponding sequence in [34]. Our result largely extends a result of Costakis in [19].
