H\"{o}lder's inequality, since its appearance in 1888, has played a fundamental role in Mathematical Analysis and it is, without any doubt, one of the milestones in Mathematics. It may seem strange that, nowadays, it keeps resurfacing and bringing new insights to the mathematical community. In this expository article we show how a variant of H\"{o}lder's inequality (although well-known in PDEs) was essentially overlooked in Functional Analysis and has had a crucial (and in some sense unexpected) influence in very recent and major breakthroughs in Mathematics. Some of these recent advances appeared in 2012-2014 and include the theory of Dirichlet series, the famous Bohr radius problem, certain classical inequalities (such as Bohnenblust--Hille or Hardy--Littlewood), or even Mathematical Physics.
