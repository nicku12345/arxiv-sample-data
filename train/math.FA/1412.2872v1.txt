We characterize boundedness, compactness and weak compactness of Volterra operators acting between different weighted Banach spaces of entire functions with weighted sup-norms in terms of the symbol g. Thus we complement recent work by Bassallote, Contreras, Hern\'andez-Mancera, Mart\'in and Paul for spaces of holomorphic functions on the disc and by Constantin and Pel\'aez for reflexive weighted Fock spaces.
