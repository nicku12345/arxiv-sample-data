Consider the domain E in \mathbb{C}^3 defined by      E=\{(a_{11},a_{22},\text{det}A): A=\begin{pmatrix} a_{11} & a_{12} \\ a_{21} & a_{22} \end{pmatrix}\text{ with }\lVert A \rVert <1\}.      This is called the tetrablock. This paper constructs explicit boundary normal dilation for a triple (A,B,P) of commuting bounded operators which has \bar{E} as a spectral set.   We show that the dilation is minimal and unique under a certain natural condition. As is well-known, uniqueness of minimal dilation usually does not hold good in several variables, e.g., Ando's dilation is not known to be unique. However, in the case of the tetrablock, the third component of the dilation can be chosen in such a way as to ensure uniqueness.
