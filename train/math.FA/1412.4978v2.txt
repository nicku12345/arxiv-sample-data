We study the relation between module and Hochschild cohomology groups of Banach algebras with a compatible module structure. More precisely, we show that for every commutative Banach    \mathcal{A} - \mathfrak{A}-bimodule  X  and every  k \in \mathbb{N}, the seminormed spaces    \mathcal{H}^{k}_{\mathfrak{A}} (\mathcal{A},X^*) and  \mathcal{H}^k (\frac{\mathcal{A}}{J}, X^*)  are isomorphic, where  J  is the closed ideal of  \mathcal{A}  generated by the elements of the form  a (\alpha \cdot b)-(a\cdot \alpha)b with  a,b \in \mathcal{A}  and \alpha \in \mathfrak{A}.    As an example, we calculate the module cohomologies of inverse semigroup algebras with coefficients in some related function algebras. In particular, we show that for an inverse semigroup  S  with the set of idempotents  E , when \ell^1(E)  acts on \ell^1(S)  by multiplication from right and trivially from left, the first module cohomology \mathcal{H}^1_{\ell^1(E)} (\ell^1(S), \ell^1(G_S)^{(2n+1)}) is trivial for each  n \in \mathbb{N} . As a consequence we conclude that the second module cohomology \mathcal{H}^2_{\ell^1(E)} (\ell^1(S),\ell^1(G_S)^{(2n+1)}) is a Banach space, where  G_S  is the maximal group homomorphic image of  S .
