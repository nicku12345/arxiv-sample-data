Hartman proved in 1939 that the width of the largest possible strip in the complex plane, on which a Dirichlet series \sum_n a_n n^{-s} is uniformly a.s.-sign convergent (i.e., \sum_n \varepsilon_n a_n n^{-s} converges uniformly for almost all sequences of signs \varepsilon_n =\pm 1) but does not convergent absolutely, equals 1/2. We study this result from a more modern point of view within the framework of so called Hardy-type Dirichlet series with values in a Banach space.
