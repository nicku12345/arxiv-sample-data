We consider pairs of Banach spaces (M_0, M) such that M_0 is defined in terms of a little-o condition, and M is defined by the corresponding big-O condition. The construction is general and pairs include function spaces of vanishing and bounded mean oscillation, vanishing weighted and weighted spaces of functions or their derivatives, M\"obius invariant spaces of analytic functions, Lipschitz-H\"older spaces, etc. It has previously been shown that the bidual M_0** of M_0 is isometrically isomorphic with M. The main result of this paper is that M_0 is an M-ideal in M. This has several useful consequences: M_0 has Pelczynskis properties (u) and (V), M_0 is proximinal in M, and M_0* is a strongly unique predual of M, while M_0 itself never is a strongly unique predual.
