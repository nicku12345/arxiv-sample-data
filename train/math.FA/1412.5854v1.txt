Applying a well-known theorem due to Eidelheit, we give a short proof of the surjectivity of the combinatorial Laplacian on connected locally finite undirected simplicial graph G with countably infinite vertex set V, established by Ceccherini-Silberstein, Coornaert, and Dodziuk. In fact, we show that every linear operator on \mathbb{K}^V which has finite hopping range and satisfies the pointwise maximum principle is surjective.
