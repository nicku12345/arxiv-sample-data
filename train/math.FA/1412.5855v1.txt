Radon measures belonging to the negative Sobolev space H^{-1}(\mathbb{R}^2) are important from the point of view of fluid mechanics as they model vorticity of vortex-sheet solutions of incompressible Euler equations. In this note we discuss regularity conditions sufficient for nonnegative Radon measures supported on a line to be in H^{-1}(\mathbb{R}^2). Applying the obtained results, we derive consequences for measures on \mathbb{R}^2 with arbitrary support and prove elementarily, among other things, that measures belonging to H^{-1}(\mathbb{R}^2) may be supported on a set of Hausdorff dimension 0. We comment on possible numerical applications.
