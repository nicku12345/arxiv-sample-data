An elegant but elementary result of Wolff from 1921, when interpreted in terms of Banach algebras, shows that it is possible to find a sequence of distinct characters \phi_n on the disc algebra and an \ell_1 sequence of complex numbers \lambda_n, not all zero, such that \sum_{n=1}^\infty \lambda_n \phi_n =0. We observe that, even for general commutative, unital Banach algebras, this is not possible if the closure of the countable set of characters has no perfect subsets.
