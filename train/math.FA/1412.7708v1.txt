We give a survey of the known connections between regularity conditions and amenability conditions in the setting of uniform algebras. For a uniform algebra A we consider the set, A_{lc}, of functions in A which are locally constant on a (varying) dense open subset of the character space of A. We show that, for a separable uniform algebra A, if A has bounded relative units at every point of a dense subset of the character space of A, then A_{lc} is dense in A. We construct a separable, essential, regular uniform algebra A on its character space X such that every point of X is a peak point for A, A has bounded relative units at every point of a dense open subset of X and yet A is not weakly amenable. In particular, this shows that a continuous derivation from a separable, essential uniform algebra A to its dual need not annihilate A_{lc}.
