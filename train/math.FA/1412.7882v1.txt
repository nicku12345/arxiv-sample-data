Given real numbers \beta \equiv \beta ^{\left( 4\right) }\colon \beta_{00}, \beta _{10}, \beta _{01}, \beta _{20}, \beta _{11},  \beta _{02}, \beta _{30}, \beta _{21}, \beta _{12}, \beta _{03}, \beta _{40}, \beta _{31}, \beta _{22}, \beta _{13}, \beta _{04}, with \beta _{00} >0, the quartic real moment problem for \beta  entails finding conditions for the existence of a positive Borel measure \mu , supported in \mathbb{R}^2, such that \beta _{ij}=\int s^{i}t^{j}\,d\mu \;\;(0\leq i+j\leq 4) . Let \mathcal{M}(2) be the 6 x 6 moment matrix for \beta^{(4)}, given by \mathcal{M}(2)_{\mathbf{i},\mathbf{j}}:=\beta_{\mathbf{i}+\mathbf{j}}, where \mathbf{i},\mathbf{j} \in \mathbb{Z}^2_+ and \left|\mathbf{i}\right|,\left|\mathbf{j}\right|\le 2. In this note we find concrete representing measures for \beta^{(4)} when \mathcal{M}(2) is nonsingular; moreover, we prove that it is possible to ensure that one such representing measure is 6-atomic.
