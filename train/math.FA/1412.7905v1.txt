Let A and B be positive semidefinite matrices. The limit of the expression Z_p:=(A^{p/2}B^pA^{p/2})^{1/p} as p tends to 0 is given by the well known Lie-Trotter-Kato formula. A similar formula holds for the limit of G_p:=(A^p\,\#\,B^p)^{2/p} as p tends to 0, where X\,\#\,Y is the geometric mean of X and Y. In this paper we study the complementary limit of Z_p and G_p as p tends to \infty, with the ultimate goal of finding an explicit formula, which we call the anti Lie-Trotter formula. We show that the limit of Z_p exists and find an explicit formula in a special case. The limit of G_p is shown for 2\times2 matrices only.
