Let \mathcal{M}(\Omega, \mu) denote the algebra of all scalar-valued measurable functions on a measure space (\Omega, \mu). Let B \subset \mathcal{M}(\Omega, \mu) be a set of finitely supported measurable functions such that the essential range of each f \in B is a subset of \{ 0,1 \}. The main result of this paper shows that for any p \in (0, \infty), B has strict p-negative type when viewed as a metric subspace of L_{p}(\Omega, \mu) if and only if B is an affinely independent subset of \mathcal{M}(\Omega, \mu) (when \mathcal{M}(\Omega, \mu) is considered as a real vector space). It follows that every two-valued (Schauder) basis of L_{p}(\Omega, \mu) has strict p-negative type. For instance, for each p \in (0, \infty), the system of Walsh functions in L_{p}[0,1] is seen to have strict p-negative type. The techniques developed in this paper also provide a systematic way to construct, for any p \in (2, \infty), subsets of L_{p}(\Omega, \mu) that have p-negative type but not q-negative type for any q > p. Such sets preclude the existence of certain types of isometry into L_{p}-spaces.
