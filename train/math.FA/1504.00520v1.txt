We introduce and develop the notion of hyper-ideals of multilinear operators between Banach spaces. While the well studied notion of ideals of multilinear operators (multi-ideals) relies on the composition with linear operators, the notion we propose, by considering the composition with multilinear operators, explores more deeply the nonlinear feature of the subject. The results we prove show that, although more restrictive a priori, hyper-ideals enjoy nice general properties and its theory is rich enough to provide distinguished examples in every situation where the corresponding multi-ideal fails to be a hyper-ideal.
