The main result of this paper is a quantified version of Ingham's Tauberian theorem for bounded vector-valued sequences rather than functions. It gives an estimate on the rate of decay of such a sequence in terms of the behaviour of a certain boundary function, with the quality of the estimate depending on the degree of smoothness this boundary function is assumed to possess. The result is then used to give a new proof of the quantified Katznelson-Tzafriri theorem recently obtained in [21].
