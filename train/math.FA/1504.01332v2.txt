We compare the space of square-summable functions on an infinite graph (denoted \ell^2(G)) with the space of functions of finite energy (denoted \mathcal{H}_{\mathcal{E}}). There is a notion of inclusion that allows \ell^2(G) to be embedded into \mathcal{H}_{\mathcal{E}}, but the required inclusion operator is unbounded in most interesting cases. These observations assist in the construction of the Krein extension of the Laplace operator on \mathcal{H}_{\mathcal{E}}. We investigate the Krein extension and compare it to the Friedrichs extension developed by the authors in a previous paper.
