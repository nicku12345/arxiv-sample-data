One can represent Schwartz distributions with values in a vector bundle E by smooth sections of E with distributional coefficients. Moreover, any linear continuous operator which maps E-valued distributions to smooth sections of another vector bundle F can be represented by sections of the external tensor product E^* \boxtimes F with coefficients in the space \mathcal{L}(\mathcal{D}', C^\infty) of operators from scalar distributions to scalar smooth functions. We establish these isomorphisms topologically, i.e., in the category of locally convex modules, using category theoretic formalism in conjunction with L. Schwartz' notion of \varepsilon-product.
