In this paper, we show that Besov and Triebel-Lizorkin functions can be approximated by a H\"older continuous function both in the Lusin sense and in norm. The results are proven in metric measure spaces for Haj{\l}asz-Besov and Haj{\l}asz-Triebel-Lizorkin functions defined by a pointwise inequality. We also prove new inequalities for medians, including a Poincar\'e type inequality, which we use in the proof of the main result.
