We answer the question of W.T. Gowers, giving an example of a bounded operator on a subspace of Gowers unconditional space which is not a strictly singular perturbation of a restriction of a diagonal operator. We make some observations on operators in arbitrary tight by support Banach space, showing in particular that in such space no two isomorphic infinitely dimensional subspaces form a direct sum.
