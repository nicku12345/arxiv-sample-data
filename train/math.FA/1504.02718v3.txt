In this note, we investigate mathematical relations among the weighted AM-GM inequality, the H\"older inequality and the weighted power-mean inequality. Meanwhile, the detailed proofs of mathematical equivalence among weighted AM-GM inequality, weighted power-mean inequality and H\"older inequality is archived.
