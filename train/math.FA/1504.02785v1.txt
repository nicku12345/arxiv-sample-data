Let H be a real (or complex) Hilbert space. Every nonnegative operator L \in L(H) admits a unique nonnegative square root R \in L(H), i.e., a nonnegative operator R \in L(H) such that R^{2}= L. Let GL^{+}_{S}(H) be the set of nonnegative isomorphisms in L(H). First we will show that GL^{+}_{S}(H) is a convex (real) Banach manifold. Denoting by L^{1/2} the nonnegative square root of L. In [10], Richard Bouldin proves that L^{1/2} depends continuously on L (this proof is non-trivial). This result has several applications. For example, it is used to find the polar decomposition of a bounded operator. This polar decomposition allows us to determine the positive and negative spectral subespaces of any self-adjoint operator, and moreover, allows us to define the Maslov index. The autor of the paper under review provides an alternative proof (and a little more simplified) that L^{1/2} depends continuously on L, and moreover, he shows that the map \begin{align}R &: GL^{+}_{S}(H)\rightarrow GL^{+}_{S}(H)\\ L &\to L^{1/2} \end{align} is a homeomorphism.
