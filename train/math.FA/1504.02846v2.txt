We propose a theory of \lambda-tensor product of operator spaces which extends the theory of Blecher-Paulsen and Effros-Ruan for the operator space projective tensor product \cite{blecp}, \cite{effros}, \cite{eff} and that of Rajpal-Kumar-Itoh for the Schur tensor product \cite{vandee4} of operator spaces.
