Given a (not necessarily continuous) homomorphism between Banach algebras \T\colon\A\to\B, an element a\in\A will be said to be B-Fredholm (respectively generalized B-Fredholm) relative to \T, if \T(a)\in \B is Drazin invertible (respectively Koliha-Drazin invertible). In this article, the aforementioned elements will be characterized and their main properties will be studied. In addition, perturbation properties will be also considered.
