Let (E,F) be a pair of Fr\'echet spaces. In this paper, we discuss whether a certain property P enjoyed by both E and F is also satisfied by the complete tensor product E \widehat{\otimes}_{\pi} F. Specifically we focus on the two properties generalizing K\"othe spaces: the normability condition called the property (y), and the property of smallness of bounded subsets of Fr\'echet spaces up to a complemented Banach subspace in connection with the problem of topologies of A. Grothendieck. We also consider the stability of some well known equivalences of operator classes with an application in the problem whether the sum of complemented subspaces is also complemented.
