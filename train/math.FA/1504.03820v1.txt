We study the behaviour of sequences U_2^n X U_1^{-n}, where U_1, U_2 are unitary operators, whose spectral measures are singular with respect to the Lebesgue measure, and the commutator XU_1-U_2X is small in a sense. The conjecture about the weak averaged convergence of the difference U_2^n X U_1^{-n}-U_2^{-n} X U_1^n to the zero operator is discussed and its connection with complex-symmetric operators is established in a general situation. For a model case where U_1=U_2 is the unitary operator of multiplication by z on L^2(\mu), sufficient conditions for the convergence as in the Conjecture are given in terms of kernels of integral operators.
