A formula for the norm of a bilinear Schur multiplier acting from the Cartesian product \mathcal S^2\times \mathcal S^2 of two copies of the Hilbert-Schmidt classes into the trace class \mathcal S^1 is established in terms of linear Schur multipliers acting on the space \mathcal S^\infty of all compact operators. Using this formula, we resolve Peller's problem on Koplienko-Neidhardt trace formulae. Namely, we prove that there exist a twice continuously differentiable function f with a bounded second derivative, a self-adjoint (unbounded) operator A and a self-adjoint operator B\in \mathcal S^2 such that  f(A+B)-f(A)-\frac{d}{dt}(f(A+tB))\big\vert_{t=0}\notin \mathcal S^1.
