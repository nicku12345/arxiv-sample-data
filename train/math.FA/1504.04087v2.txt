We extended the known result that symbols from modulation spaces M^{\infty,1}(\mathbb{R}^{2n}), also known as the Sj\"{o}strand's class, produce bounded operators in L^2(\mathbb{R}^n), to general L^p boundedness at the cost of lost of derivatives. Indeed, we showed that pseudo-differential operators acting from L^p-Sobolev spaces L^p_s(\mathbb{R}^n) to L^p(\mathbb{R}^n) spaces with symbols from the modulation space M^{\infty,1}(\mathbb{R}^{2n}) are bounded, whenever s\geq n|1/p-1/2|. This estimate is sharp for all 1\leq p\leq\infty.
