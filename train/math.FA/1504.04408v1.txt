We prove in this paper that a sequence M:\mathbb{Z}^{n}\to\mathcal{L}(E) of bounded variation is a Fourier multiplier on the Besov space B_{p,q}^{s}(\mathbb{T}^{n},E) for s\in\mathbb{R}, 1<p<\infty, 1\leq q\leq\infty and E a Banach space, if and only if E is a UMD-space. This extends in some sense the Theorem 4.2 in [AB04] to the n-dimensional case. The result is used to obtain existence and uniqueness of solution for some Cauchy problems with periodic boundary conditions.
