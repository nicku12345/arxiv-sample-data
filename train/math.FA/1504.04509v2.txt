In this paper it is shown that the Hardy-Littlewood maximal operator M is not bounded on Zygmund-Morrey space \mathcal{M}_{L(\log L),\lambda}, but M is still bounded on \mathcal{M}_{L(\log L),\lambda} for radially decreasing functions. The boundedness of the iterated maximal operator M^2 from \mathcal{M}_{L(\log L),\lambda} to weak Zygmund-Morrey space {\mathcal {W \! M}}_{L(\log L),\lambda} is proved. The class of functions for which the maximal commutator C_b is bounded from \mathcal{M}_{L(\log L),\lambda} to {\mathcal {W \! M}}_{L(\log L),\lambda} are characterized. It is proved that the commutator of the Hardy-Littlewood maximal operator M with function b \in BMO({{\mathbb R}}^n) such that b^- \in L_{\infty}({{\mathbb R}}^n) is bounded from \mathcal{M}_{L(\log L),\lambda} to {\mathcal {W \! M}}_{L(\log L),\lambda}. New pointwise characterizations of M_{\alpha} M by means of norm of Hardy-Littlewood maximal function in classical Morrey spaces are given.
