In this short note, we prove some basic results on pseudo Schur complement and the pseudo principal pivot transform of a block matrix. Pseudo Schur complement and pseudo principal pivot ransform are extensions of the Schur complement and the principal pivot transform, respectively, where the usual inverse is replaced by the Moore-Penrose inverse. The objective is to record these results for use in future.
