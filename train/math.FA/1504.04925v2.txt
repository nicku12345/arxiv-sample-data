Making use of a unified approach to certain classes of induced representations, we establish here a number of detailed spectral theoretic decomposition results. They apply to specific problems from non-commutative harmonic analysis, ergodic theory, and dynamical systems. Our analysis is in the setting of semidirect products, discrete subgroups, and solenoids. Our applications include analysis and ergodic theory of Bratteli diagrams and their compact duals; of wavelet sets, and wavelet representations.
