In this work we study the essential spectra of composition operators on weighted Bergman spaces of analytic functions which might be termed as "quasi-parabolic." This is the class of composition operators on A_{\alpha}^{2} with symbols whose conjugate with the Cayley transform on the upper half-plane are of the form \varphi(z)= z+\psi(z), where \psi\in H^{\infty}(\mathbb{H}) and \Im(\psi(z)) > \epsilon > 0. We especially examine the case where \psi is discontinuous at infinity. A new method is devised to show that this type of composition operators fall in a C*-algebra of Toeplitz operators and Fourier multipliers. This method enables us to provide new examples of essentially normal composition operators and to calculate their essential spectra.
