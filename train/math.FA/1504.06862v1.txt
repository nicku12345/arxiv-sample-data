It was proved by Argyros and Dodos that, for many classes  C  of separable Banach spaces which share some property  P , there exists an isomorphically universal space that satisfies  P  as well. We introduce a variant of their amalgamation technique which provides an isometrically universal space in the case that  C  consists of spaces with a monotone Schauder basis. For example, we prove that if  C  is a set of separable Banach spaces which is analytic with respect to the Effros-Borel structure and every  X \in C  is reflexive and has a monotone Schauder basis, then there exists a separable reflexive Banach space that is isometrically universal for  C .
