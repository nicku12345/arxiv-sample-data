The principal theorem of Sz.-Nagy on dilation of a positive definite Hilbert space operator valued function has played a central role in the development of the non-self-adjoint operator theory. In this paper we introduce the positive definiteness for locally Hilbert space operator valued kernels, we prove an analogue of the Sz.-Nagy dilation theorem and, as application, we obtain dilation results for locally contractions and locally \rho - contractions as well as for locally semi-spectral measures.
