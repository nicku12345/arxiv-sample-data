A classical theorem of von Neumann asserts that every unbounded self-adjoint operator A in a separable Hilbert space H is unitarily equivalent to an operator B in H such that D(A)\cap D(B)=\{0\}. Equivalently this can be formulated as a property for nonclosed operator ranges. We will show that von Neumann's theorem does not directly extend to the nonseparable case. In this paper we prove a characterisation of the property that an operator range \mathcal{R} in a general Hilbert space H admits a unitary operator U such that U\mathcal{R}\cap\mathcal{R}=\{0\}. This allows us to study stability properties of operator ranges with the aforementioned property.
