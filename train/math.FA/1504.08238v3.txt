The essence of the notion of lineability and spaceability is to find linear structures in somewhat chaotic environments. The existing methods, in general, use \textit{ad hoc} arguments and few general techniques are known. Motivated by the search of general methods, in this paper we formally extend recent results of G.\ Botelho and V.V. F\'{a}varo on invariant sequence spaces to a more general setting. Our main results show that some subsets of invariant sequence spaces contain, up to the null vector, a closed infinite-dimensional subspace.
