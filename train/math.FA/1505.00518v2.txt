A proof is given for the "only if" part of the result stated in the previous paper of the series that a suitably nondegenerate Calder\'on-Zygmund operator T is bounded in a Banach lattice X on \mathbb R^n if and only if the Hardy-Littlewood maximal operator M is bounded in both X and X', under the assumption that X has the Fatou property and X is p-convex and q-concave with some 1 < p, q < \infty. We also get rid of a fixed point theorem in the proof of the main lemma and give an improved version of an earlier result concerning the divisibility of \mathrm {BMO}-regularity.
