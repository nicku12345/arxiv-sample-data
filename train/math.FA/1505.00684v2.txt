In this paper, we study hyponormal weighed composition operators on the Hardy and weighted Bergman spaces. For functions \psi \in A(\mathbb{D}) which are not the zero function, we characterize all hyponormal compact weighted composition operators C_{\psi,\varphi} on H^{2} and A^{2}_{\alpha}. Next, we show that for \varphi \in \mbox{LFT}(\mathbb{D}), if C_{\varphi} is hyponormal on H^{2} or A^{2}_{\alpha}, then \varphi(z)=\lambda z, where |\lambda| \leq 1 or \varphi is a hyperbolic non-automorphism with \varphi(0)=0 and such that \varphi has another fixed point in \partial \mathbb{D}. After that, we find the essential spectral radius of C_{\varphi} on H^{2} and A^{2}_{\alpha}, when \varphi has a Denjoy-Wolff point \zeta \in \partial \mathbb{D}. Finally, descriptions of spectral radii are provided for some hyponormal weighted composition operators on H^{2} and A^{2}_{\alpha}.
