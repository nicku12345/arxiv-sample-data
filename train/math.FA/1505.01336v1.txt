In a recent paper we presented a general perturbation result for generators of C_0-semigroups. The aim of the present paper is to replace, in case the unperturbed semigroup is analytic, the various conditions appearing in this result by simpler assumptions on the domain and range of the operators involved. The power of our result to treat classes of PDE's systematically is illustrated by considering a generic example, a degenerate differential operator with generalized Wentzell boundary conditions and a reaction diffusion equation subject to Neumann boundary conditions with distributed unbounded delay.
