In this paper, a new notion, named Riemann-Liouville fractional cosine function is presented. It is proved that a Riemann-Liouville \alpha-order fractional cosine function is equivalent to Riemann-Liouville \alpha-order fractional resolvents introduced in [Z.D. Mei, J.G. Peng, Y. Zhang, Math. Nachr. 288, No. 7, 784-797 (2015)].
