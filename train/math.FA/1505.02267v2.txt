If a,b are n\times n matrices, Ando proved that Young's inequality is valid for their singular values: if p>1 and 1/p+1/q=1, then  \lambda_k|ab^*|\le \lambda_k( \frac1p |a|^p+\frac 1q |b|^q ) \, \textit{ for all }k.  Later, this result was extended for the singular values of a pair of compact operators acting on a Hilbert space by Erlijman, Farenick and Zeng. In this paper we prove that if a,b are compact operators, then equality holds in Young's inequality if and only if |a|^p=|b|^q, obtaining a complete characterization of such a,b in relation to other (operator norm) Young inequalities.
