Using tools from the theory of operator ideals and s-numbers, we develop a general approach to transfer estimates for L_2 -approximation of Sobolev functions into estimates for L_\infty-approximation, with precise control of all involved constants. As an illustration, we derive some results for periodic isotropic Sobolev spaces H^s ({\mathbb T}^d) and Sobolev spaces of dominating mixed smoothness H^s_{\rm mix} ({\mathbb T}^d), always equipped with natural norms. Some results for isotropic as well as dominating mixed Besov spaces are also obtained.
