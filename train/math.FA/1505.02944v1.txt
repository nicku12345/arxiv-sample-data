We investigate the compactness of composition operators on the Hardy space of Dirichlet series induced by a map \varphi(s)=c_0s+\varphi_0(s), where \varphi_0 is a Dirichlet polynomial. Our results depend heavily on the characteristic c_0 of \varphi and, when c_0=0, on both the degree of \varphi_0 and its local behaviour near a boundary point. We also study the approximation numbers for some of these operators. Our methods involve geometric estimates of Carleson measures and tools from differential geometry.
