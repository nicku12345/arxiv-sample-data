We show that some previous results concerning the boundedness of differentiation and integration operators on weighted spaces given by radial weights in the unit disk or the complex plane might fail without some natural additional conditions. In view of this we develop a new elementary approach which is essentially different from the previous one and can be applied for weights and domains of general types. We also establish a new characterization of some popular classes of radial weights.
