For \alpha, \beta \in L^{\infty} (S^1), the singular integral operator S_{\alpha,\beta} on L^2 (S^1) is defined by S_{\alpha,\beta}f:= \alpha Pf+\beta Qf, where P denotes the orthogonal projection of L^2(S^1) onto the Hardy space H^2(S^1), and Q denotes the orthogonal projection onto H^2(S^1)^{\perp}. In a recent paper Nakazi and Yamamoto have studied the normality and self-adjointness of S_{\alpha,\beta}. This work has shown that S_{\alpha,\beta} may have analogous properties to that of the Toeplitz operator. In this paper we study several other properties of S_{\alpha,\beta}.
