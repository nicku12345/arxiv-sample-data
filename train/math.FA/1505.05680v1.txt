We show that, for 0<s<1, 0<p<\infty, 0<q<\infty, Haj\l asz-Besov and Haj\l asz-Triebel-Lizorkin functions can be approximated in the norm by discrete median convolutions. This allows us to show that, for these functions, the limit of medians, \[ \lim_{r\to 0}m_u^\gamma(B(x,r))=u^*(x), \] exists quasieverywhere and defines a quasicontinuous representative of u. The above limit exists quasieverywhere also for Haj\l asz functions u\in M^{s,p}, 0<s\le 1, 0<p<\infty, but approximation of u in M^{s,p} by discrete (median) convolutions is not in general possible.
