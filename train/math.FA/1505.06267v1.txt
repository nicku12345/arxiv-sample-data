A spectral theory of linear operators on a rigged Hilbert space is applied to Schr\"odinger operators with exponentially decaying potentials and dilation analytic potentials. The theory of rigged Hilbert spaces provides a unified approach to resonances (generalized eigenvalues) for both classes of potentials without using any spectral deformation techniques. Generalized eigenvalues for one dimensional Schr\"odinger operators (ordinary differential operators) are investigated in detail. A certain holomorphic function \mathbb{D}(\lambda) is constructed so that \mathbb{D}(\lambda) = 0 if and only if \lambda  is a generalized eigenvalue. It is proved that \mathbb{D}(\lambda) is equivalent to the analytic continuation of the Evans function. In particular, a new formulation of the Evans function and its analytic continuation is given.
