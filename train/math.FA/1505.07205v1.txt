This dissertation summarizes my investigations in operator theory during my PhD studies.   The first chapter is an introduction to that field of operator theory which was developed by B. Sz.-Nagy and C. Foias, the theory of power-bounded Hilbert space operators. In the second and third chapter I characterize operators which arise from power-bounded operators asymptotically. Chapter 4 is devoted to provide a possible generalization of (the necessity part of) Sz.-Nagy's famous similarity theorem. In Chapter 5 I collected my results concerning the commutant mapping of asymptotically non-vanishing contractions. In the final chapter the reader can find results about cyclic properties of weighted shift operators on directed trees.
