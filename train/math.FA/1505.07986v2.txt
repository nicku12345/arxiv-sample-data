We show that the Heisenberg group \mathbb{H}^n contains a measure zero set N such that every Lipschitz function f\colon \mathbb{H}^n \to \mathbb{R} is Pansu differentiable at a point of N. The proof adapts the construction of small 'universal differentiability sets' in the Euclidean setting: we find a point of N and a horizontal direction where the directional derivative in horizontal directions is almost locally maximal, then deduce Pansu differentiability at such a point.
