For a fixed Banach operator ideal \mathcal A, we use the notion of \mathcal A-compact sets of Carl and Stephani to study \mathcal A-compact polynomials and \mathcal A-compact holomorphic mappings. Namely, those mappings g\colon X\rightarrow Y such that every x \in X has a neighborhood V_x such that g(V_x) is relatively \mathcal A-compact. We show that the behavior of \mathcal A-compact polynomials is determined by its behavior in any neighborhood of any point. We transfer some known properties of \mathcal A-compact operators to \mathcal A-compact polynomials. In order to study \mathcal A-compact holomorphic functions, we appeal to the \mathcal A-compact radius of convergence which allows us to characterize the functions in this class. Under certain hypothesis on the ideal \mathcal A, we give examples showing that our characterization is sharp.
