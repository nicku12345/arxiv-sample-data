In this short note we obtain new lower bounds for the constants of the real Hardy--Littlewood inequality for m-linear forms on \ell_{p}^{2} spaces when p=2m and for certain values of m. The real and complex cases for the general case \ell_{p}^{n} were recently investigated by G. Araujo et al. When n=2 our results improve the best known estimates for these constants.
