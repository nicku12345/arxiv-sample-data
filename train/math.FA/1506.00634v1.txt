Given any square matrix or a bounded operator A in a Hilbert space such that p(A) is normal (or similar to normal), we construct a Banach algebra, depending on the polynomial p, for which a simple functional calculus holds. When the polynomial is of degree d, then the algebra deals with continuous \mathbb C^d-valued functions, defined on the spectrum of p(A). In particular, the calculus provides a natural approach to deal with nontrivial Jordan blocks and one does not need differentiability at such eigenvalues.
