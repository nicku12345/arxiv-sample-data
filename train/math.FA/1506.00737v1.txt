Let A be a positive operator on a Hilbert space \mathcal{H} with 0<m\leq A\leq M and X and Y are two   isometries on \mathcal{H} such that X^{*}Y=0. For every 2-positive linear map \Phi, define \Gamma=\left(\Phi(X^{*}AY)\Phi(Y^{*}AY)^{-1}\Phi(Y^{*}AX)\right)^{p}\Phi(X^{*}AX)^{-p}, \, \, \, p>0. We consider several upper bounds for \frac{1}{2}|\Gamma+\Gamma^{*}|. These bounds complement a recent result on operator Wielandt inequality.
