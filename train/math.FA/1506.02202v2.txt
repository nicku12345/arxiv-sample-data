Let \mathbb{I} be a proper ideal of H^{\infty}(\D). We prove the corona theorem for infinitely many generators on the algebra H^{\infty}_{\mathbb{I}} in which the corona theorem for finitely many functions is known to hold. This settles the conjecture of Ryle \cite{ryle1}. We also provide the estimates for corona solutions. Moreover, we prove a generalized Wolff's Ideal Theorem for this sub-algebra.
