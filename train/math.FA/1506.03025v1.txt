The notions of module pseudo-amenable and module pseudo-contractible Banach algebras are introduced. For a Banach algebra with bounded approximate identity, module pseudo-amenability and module approximate amenability are the same properties. It is given a complete characterization of module pseudo-amenability for a Banach algebra. For every inverse semigroup S with subsemigroup E of idempotents, necessary and sufficient conditions are obtained for the \ell^1(S) and its second dual to be \ell^1(E)-module pseudo-amenable.
