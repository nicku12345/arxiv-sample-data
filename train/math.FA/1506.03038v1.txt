It is shown that for a locally compact group G, if L^{1}(G)^{**} is approximately weakly amenable, then M(G) is approximately weakly amenable. Then, new notions of approximate weak amenability and approximate cyclic amenability for Banach algebras are introduced. Bounded \omega^{*}-approximately weakly [cyclic] amenable \ell^{1}-Munn algebras are characterized.
