In this article, it is proved that a functional equation of (linear) Jordan triple derivations on unital Banach algebras under quite natural and simple assumptions is hyperstable. It is also shown that under some mild conditions approximate Jordan triple derivations on unital semiprime Banach algebras are (linear) derivations.
