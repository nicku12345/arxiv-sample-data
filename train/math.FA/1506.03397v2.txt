This article closes the cycle of characterizations of greedy-like bases in the isometric case initiated in [F. Albiac and P. Wojtaszczyk, Characterization of 1-greedy bases, J. Approx. Theory 138 (2006)] with the characterization of 1-greedy bases and continued in [F. Albiac and J. L. Ansorena, Characterization of 1-quasi-greedy bases, arXiv:1504.04368v1 [math.FA] (2015)] with the characterization of 1-quasi-greedy bases. Here we settle the problem of providing a characterization of 1-almost greedy bases in Banach spaces. We show that a (semi-normalized) basis in a Banach space is almost greedy with almost greedy constant equal to 1 if and only if it has Property (A). This fact permits now to state that a basis is 1-greedy if and only if it is 1-almost greedy and 1-quasi-greedy. As a by-product of our work we also provide a tight characterization of almost greedy bases.
