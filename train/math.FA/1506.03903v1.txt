Let C be a nonempty closed convex subset of a Banach space E. In this paper we introduce a new definition for variational inequality V I (C, B) on E that generalizes the analogue definition on Hilbert spaces. We generalize (u, v)-cocoercive mappings and v-strongly monotone mappings from Hilbert spaces to Banach spaces. Then we prove the generalized variational inequality V I (C, B) is singleton for (u, v)-cocoercive mappings under appropriate assumptions on Banach spaces that extends and improves [S. Saeidi, Comments on relaxed (u, v)-cocoercive mappings. Int. J. Nonlinear Anal. Appl. 1 (2010) No. 1, 54-57].
