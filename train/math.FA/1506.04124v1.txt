We provide necessary and sufficient conditions on the existence of common hypercyclic vectors for multiples of the backward shift operator along sparse powers. Our main result strongly generalizes corresponding results which concern the full orbit of the backward shift. Some of our results are valid in a more general context, in the sense that they apply for a wide class of hypercyclic operators.
