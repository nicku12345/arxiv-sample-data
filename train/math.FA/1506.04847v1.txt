In this paper, we study the hereditary properties of module (\phi,\varphi)-amenability on Banach algebras. We also define the concept of module character contractibility for Banach algebras and obtain characterizations of module character contractible Banach algebras in terms of the existence of module (\phi,\varphi)-diagonals. We introduce module approximately character amenable Banach algebras. Finally, for every inverse semigroup S with subsemigroup E of idempotents, we find necessary and sufficient conditions for the \ell^1(S) and its second dual to be module approximate character amenable (as a \ell^1(E)-module).
