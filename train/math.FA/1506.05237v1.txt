We present an equivalent midpoint locally uniformly rotund (MLUR) renorming X of C[0,1] on which every weakly compact projection P satisfies the equation \|I-P\| = 1+\|P\| (I is the identity operator on X). As a consequence we obtain an MLUR space X with the properties D2P, that every non-empty relatively weakly open subset of its unit ball B_X has diameter 2, and the LD2P+, that for every slice of B_X and every norm 1 element x inside the slice there is another element y inside the slice of distance as close to 2 from x as desired. An example of an MLUR space with the D2P, the LD2P+, and with convex combinations of slices of arbitrary small diameter is also given.
