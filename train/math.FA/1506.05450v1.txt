In this research article, we establish some identities and estimates for the operator norms and the Hausdorff measures of noncompactness of certain operators on some lacunary difference sequence spaces defined by Orlicz function. Moreover, we apply our results to characterize some classes of compact operators on those spaces by using the Hausdorff measure of noncompactness.
