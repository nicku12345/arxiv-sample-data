In this article, we study about the \lambda-statistical convergence with respect to the density of moduli and find some results related to statistical convergence as well. Also we introduce the concept of f_\lambda-summable sequence and try to investigate some relation between the f_\lambda-summability and module % \lambda-statistical convergence.
