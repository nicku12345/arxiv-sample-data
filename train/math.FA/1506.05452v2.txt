We study some new strongly almost lacunary statistical A-convergent sequence space of order \alpha defined by a Musielak-Orlicz function. We also give some inclusion relations between the newly introduced class of sequences with the spaces of strongly almost lacunary A-convergent sequence of order \alpha. Moreover we have examined some results on Musielak-Orlicz function with respect to these spaces.
