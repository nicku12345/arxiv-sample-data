In this paper we introduced the generalized difference Cesaro sequence spaces of fuzzy real numbers defined by Orlicz function. We study some topological properties of these spaces. We obtain some inclusion relations involving these sequence spaces. These notions generalize many notions on difference Cesaro sequence spaces.
