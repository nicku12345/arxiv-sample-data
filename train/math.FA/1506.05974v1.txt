Given operators A,B in some ideal \mathcal{I} in the algebra \mathcal{L}(H) of all bounded operators on a separable Hilbert space H, can we give conditions guaranteeing the existence of a trace-class operator C such that B \otimes C is submajorized (in the sense of Hardy--Littlewood) by A \otimes C ? In the case when \mathcal{I} = \mathcal{L}_1, a necessary and almost sufficient condition is that the inequalities {\rm Tr} (B^p) \leq {\rm Tr} (A^p) hold for every p \in [1,\infty]. We show that the analogous statement fails for \mathcal{I} = \mathcal{L}_{1,\infty} by connecting it with the study of Dixmier traces.
