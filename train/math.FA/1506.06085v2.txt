We study the concept of density for sets of natural numbers in some lacunary A-convergent sequence spaces. Also we are trying to investigate some relation between the ordinary convergence and module statistical convergence for evey unbounded modulus function. Morever we also study some results on the newly defined lacunary f-statistically A-convergent sequence spaces with respect to some Musielak-Orlicz function.
