We describe the structure of all continuous Jordan triple endomorphisms of the set \mathbb{P}_2 of all positive definite 2\times 2 matrices thus completing a recent result of ours. We also mention an application concerning sorts of surjective generalized isometries on \mathbb{P}_2 and, as second application, we complete another former result of ours on the structure of sequential endomorphisms of finite dimensional effect algebras.
