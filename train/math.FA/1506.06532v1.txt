We examine the surjectivity of isometries between weighted spaces of holomorphic functions. We show that for certain classical weights on the open unit disc all isometries of the weighted space of holomorphic functions, { \mathcal H}_{v_o}( \Delta), are surjective. Criteria for surjectivity of isometries of { \mathcal H}_v(U) in terms of a separation condition on points in the image of { \mathcal H}_{v_o}(U) are also given for U a bounded open set in \mathbb{C}. Considering the weight v(z)= 1-|z|^2 and the isomorphism f\mapsto f' we are able to show that all isometries of the little Bloch space are surjective.
