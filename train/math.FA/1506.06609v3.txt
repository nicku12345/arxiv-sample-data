We extend the well-known Katznelson-Tzafriri theorem, originally posed for power-bounded operators, to the case of Ces\`aro bounded operators of any order \alpha>0. For this purpose, we use a functional calculus between a new class of fractional Wiener algebras and the algebra of bounded linear operators, whose existence is characterized by the Ces\`aro boundedness. Finally, we apply the main theorem to get ergodicity results for the Ces\`aro means of bounded operators.
