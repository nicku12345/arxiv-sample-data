We prove that a continuous function f:(0,\infty) \to (0,\infty) is operator monotone increasing if and only if f(A \: !_t \: B) \leqs f(A) \: !_t \: f(B) for any positive operators A,B and scalar t \in [0,1]. Here, !_t denotes the t-weighted harmonic mean. As a counterpart, f is operator monotone decreasing if and only if the reverse of preceding inequality holds. Moreover, we obtain many characterizations of operator-monotone increasingness/decreasingness in terms of operator means. These characterizations lead to many operator inequalities involving means.
