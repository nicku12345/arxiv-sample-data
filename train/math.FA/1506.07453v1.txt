By a classical result of Kadec and Pe\l czynski (1962), every normalized weakly null sequence in L^p, p>2 contains a subsequence equivalent to the unit vector basis of \ell^2 or to the unit vector basis of \ell^p. In this paper we investigate the case 1\le p<2 and show that a necessary and sufficient condition for the first alternative in the Kadec-Pe\l czynski theorem is that the limit random measure \mu of the sequence satisfies \int_{\mathbb{R}} x^2 d\mu (x)\in L^{p/2}.
