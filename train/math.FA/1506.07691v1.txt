In this paper, we propose to define the concept of family of local atoms and then we generalize this concept to the atomic system for operator in Banach spaces by using semi-inner product. We also give a characterization of atomic systems leading to obtain new frames. In addition, a reconstruction formula is obtain. Next, some new results are established. The characterization of atomic systems allows us to state some results for sampling theory in semi-inner product reproducing kernel Banach spaces. Finally, having used frame operator in Banach spaces, new perturbation results are established.
