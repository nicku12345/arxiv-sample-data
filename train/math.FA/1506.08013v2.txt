In this paper we consider generalized square function norms of holomorphic functions with values in a Banach space. One of the main results is a characterization of embeddings of the form \[L^p(X)\subseteq \gamma(X) \subseteq L^q(X),\] in terms of the type p and cotype q for the Banach space X. As an application we prove L^p-estimates for vector-valued Littlewood-Paley-Stein g-functions and derive an embedding result for real and complex interpolation spaces under type and cotype conditions.
