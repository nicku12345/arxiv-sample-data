The concept of Soft set theory was introduced by Molodtsov in the study [8]. Soft real numbers and properties were introduced inthe study [6] and soft normed space was defined in [11]. In this study, firstly we obtain a soft normed space by defining a soft norm on (Real numbers) which is called soft normed real space. By using this normed space we define the soft linear functional and investigate some of its properties. Secondly, we introduce soft dual space and soft dual operator and investigate their properties. Finally, we state and prove the theorem about representation of soft linear functional by inner product in soft Hilbert spaces.
