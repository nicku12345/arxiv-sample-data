Let 1\le p\le q<\infty and let X be a p-convex Banach function space over a \sigma-finite measure \mu. We combine the structure of the spaces L^p(\mu) and L^q(\xi) for constructing the new space S_{X_p}^{\,q}(\xi), where \xi is a probability Radon measure on a certain compact set associated to X. We show some of its properties, and the relevant fact that every q-summing operator T defined on X can be continuously (strongly) extended to S_{X_p}^{\,q}(\xi). This result turns out to be a mixture of the Pietsch and Maurey-Rosenthal factorization theorems, which provide (strong) factorizations for q-summing operators through L^q-spaces when 1 \le q \le p. Thus, our result completes the picture, showing what happens in the complementary case 1\le p\le q, opening the door to the study of the multilinear versions of q-summing operators also in these cases.
