Our aim in this paper is to present results of existence of fixed points for continuous operators in Banach spaces using measure of noncompactness under an integral condition. This results are generalization of results given by A. Aghajania and M. Aliaskaria which are generalization of Darbo's fixed point theorem. As application we use these results to solve an integral equations in Banach spaces.
