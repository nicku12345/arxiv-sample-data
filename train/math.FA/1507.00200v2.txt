In this paper, we introduce a new iteration method and show that this iteration method can be used to approximate fixed point of almost contraction mappings. Furthermore, we prove that the new iteration method is equivalent to both Mann iteration method and Picard-Mann hybrid iteration method and also converges faster than Picard-Mann hybrid iteration method for the class of almost contraction mappings. In addition to these we give a table and graphics for support this result. Finally, we prove a data dependence result for almost contraction mappings by using the new iteration method.
