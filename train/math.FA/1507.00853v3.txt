We refine Epstein's method to prove joint concavity/convexity of matrix trace functions of Lieb type \mathrm{Tr}\,f(\Phi(A^p)^{1/2}\Psi(B^q)\Phi(A^p)^{1/2}) and symmetric (anti-) norm functions of the form \|f(\Phi(A^p)\,\sigma\,\Psi(B^q))\|, where \Phi and \Psi are positive linear maps, \sigma is an operator mean, and f(x^\gamma) with a certain power \gamma is an operator monotone function on (0,\infty). Moreover, the variational method of Carlen, Frank and Lieb is extended to general non-decreasing convex/concave functions on (0,\infty) so that we prove joint concavity/convexity of more trace functions of Lieb type.
