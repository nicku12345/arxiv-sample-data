We introduce the numerical spectrum \sigma_n(A)\subset \mathbb{C} of an (unbounded) linear operator A on a Banach space X and study its properties. Our definition is closely related to the numerical range W(A) of A and always yields a superset of W(A). In the case of bounded operators on Hilbert spaces, the two notions coincide. However, unlike the numerical range, \sigma_n(A) is always closed, convex and contains the spectrum of A. In the paper we strongly emphasise the connection of our approach to the theory of C_0-semigroups.
