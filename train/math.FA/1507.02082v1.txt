We study the Hodge-Dirac operators \mathcal{D} associated with a class of non-symmetric Ornstein-Uhlenbeck operators \mathcal{L} in infinite dimensions. For p\in (1,\infty) we prove that i\mathcal{D} generates a C_0-group in L^p with respect to the invariant measure if and only if p=2 and \mathcal{L} is self-adjoint. An explicit representation of this C_0-group in L^2 is given and we prove that it has finite speed of propagation. Furthermore we prove L^2 off-diagonal estimates for various operators associated with \mathcal{L}, both in the self-adjoint and the non-self-adjoint case.
