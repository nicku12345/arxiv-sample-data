In [11], we introduced the notion of asymptotic gauge (AG), and we used it to construct Colombeau AG-algebras. This construction concurrently generalizes that of many different algebras used in Colombeau's theory, e.g. the special one \mathcal{G}^{\srm}, the full one \gse, the NSA based algebra of asymptotic functions \hat{\mathcal{G}}, and the diffeomorphism invariant algebras \gsd, \mathcal{G}^{2} and \hat{\mathcal{G}}. In this paper we study the categorical properties of the construction of Colombeau AG-algebras with respect to the choice of the AG, and we show their consequences regarding the solvability of generalized ODE.
