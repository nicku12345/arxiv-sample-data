In this paper we shall study noncommutative central moment inequalities with a main focus on whether the commutative bounds are tight in the noncommutative case, or not. We prove that the answer is affirmative for the fourth central moment and several particular results are given in the general case. As an application, we shall present some lower estimates of the spread of Hermitian and normal matrices as well.
