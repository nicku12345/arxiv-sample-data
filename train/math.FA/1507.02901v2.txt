We say that a complex number \lambda is an extended eigenvalueof a bounded linear operator T on a Hilbert space H if there exists anonzero bounded linear operator X acting on H, called extended eigen-vector associated to \lambda, and satisfying the equation T X = \lambdaXT . In thispaper we describe the sets of extended eigenvalues and extended eigen-vectors for the product of a positive and a self-adjoint operator whichare both injective. We also treat the case of normal operators.
