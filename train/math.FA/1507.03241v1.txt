Suppose X is a real or complexified Banach space containing a complemented copy of \ell_p, p\in(1,2), and a copy (not necessarily complemented) of either \ell_q, q\in(p,\infty), or c_0. Then \mathcal{L}(X) and \mathcal{L}(X^*) each admit continuum many closed ideals. If in addition q\geq p', \frac{1}{p}+\frac{1}{p'}=1, then the closed ideals of \mathcal{L}(X) and \mathcal{L}(X^*) each fail to be linearly ordered. We obtain additional results in the special cases of \mathcal{L}(\ell_1\oplus\ell_q) and \mathcal{L}(\ell_p\oplus c_0), 1<p<2<q<\infty.
