Let M(H^\infty) be the maximal ideal space of the Banach algebra H^\infty of bounded holomorphic functions on the unit disk \mathbb D\subset\mathbb C. We prove that M(H^\infty) is homeomorphic to the Freudenthal compactification \gamma(M_a) of the set M_a of all non-trivial (analytic disks) Gleason parts of M(H^\infty). Also, we give alternative proofs of important results of Su\'{a}rez asserting that the set M_s of trivial (one-pointed) Gleason parts of M(H^\infty) is totally disconnected and that the \v{C}ech cohomology group H^2(M(H^\infty),\mathbb Z)=0.
