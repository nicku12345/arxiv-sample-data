We consider the counter images \maclJ (\rr d) and \maclJ _0(\rr d) of entire functions with exponential and almost exponential bounds, respectively, under the Bargmann transform, and we characterize them by estimates of powers of the harmonic oscillator. We also consider the Pilipovi{\'c} spaces \bsycalS _s(\rr d) and \bsySig _s(\rr d) when 0<s<1/2 and deduce their images under the Bargmann transform.
