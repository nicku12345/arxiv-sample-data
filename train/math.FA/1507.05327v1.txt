In our article [15] description in terms of abstract boundary conditions of all m-accretive extensions and their resolvents of a closed densely defined sectorial operator S have been obtained. In particular, if \{\mathcal{H},\Gamma\} is a boundary pair of S, then there is a bijective correspondence between all m-accretive extensions \tilde{S} of S and all pairs \langle \mathbf{Z},X\rangle, where \mathbf{Z} is a m-accretive linear relation in \mathcal{H} and X:\mathrm{dom}(\mathbf{Z})\to\overline{\mathrm{ran}(S_{F})} is a linear operator such that: \[ \|Xe\|^2\leqslant\mathrm{Re}(\mathbf{Z}(e),e)_{\mathcal{H}}\quad\forall e\in\mathrm{dom}(\mathbf{Z}). \] As is well known the operator S admits at least one m-sectorial extension, the Friedrichs extension. In this paper, assuming that S has non-unique m-sectorial extension, we established additional conditions on a pair \langle \mathbf{Z},X\rangle guaranteeing that corresponding \tilde{S} is m-sectorial extension of S. As an application, all m-sectorial extensions of a nonnegative symmetric operator in a planar model of two point interactions are described.
