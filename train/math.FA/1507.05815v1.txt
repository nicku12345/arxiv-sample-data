In 2006, Balan/Casazza/Edidin \cite{BCE} introduced the frame theoretic study of phaseless reconstruction. Since then, this has turned into a very active area of research. Over the years, many people have replaced the term {\it phaseless reconstruction} with {\it phase retrieval}. Casazza then asked: {\it Are these really the same?} In this paper, we will show that phase retrieval is equivalent to phaseless reconstruction. We then show, more generally, that phase retrieval by projections is equivalent to phaseless reconstruction by projections. Finally, we study {\it weak phase retrieval} and discover that it is very different from phaseless reconstruction.
