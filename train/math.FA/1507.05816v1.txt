In this paper, we develop topological modules over the ring of bicomplex numbers. We discuss bicomplex convexivity, hyperbolic-valued seminorms and hyperbolic-valued Minkowski functionals in bicomplex modules. We also study the conditions under which topological bicomplex modules and locally bicomplex convex modules become hyperbolic normable and hyperbolic metrizable respectively.
