We study in this paper some property of Lipschitz mappings which admit factorization through an operator ideal. We try to construct Lipschitz cross-norms from known tensor norms in order to represent certain classes of Lipschitz mappings. Inspired by the definition of p-summing linear operators we introduce a new concpet in the the category of Lipschitz mappings that is called strictly Lipschitz p-summing.
