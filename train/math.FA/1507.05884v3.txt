Let A be a commutative Banach algebra with non-empty character space \Delta(A). In this paper, we change the concepts of convergence and boundedness in the classical notion of bounded approximate identity. This work give us a new kind of approximate identity between bounded approximate identity and bounded weak approximate identity. More precisely, a net \{e_{\alpha}\} in A is a \emph{c-w approximate identity} if for each a\in A, the Gel'fand transform of e_{\alpha}a tends to the Gel'fand transform of a in the compact-open topology and we say \{e_{\alpha}\} is \emph{weakly bounded} if the image of \{e_{\alpha}\} under the Gel'fand transform is bounded in C_{0}(\Delta(A)).
