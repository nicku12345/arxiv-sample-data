We show that the decreasing rearrangement of the Fourier series with respect to the Jacobi polynomials for functions in L_p does not converge unless p=2. As a by-product of our work on quasi-greedy bases in L_{p}(\mu), we show that no normalized unconditional basis in L_p, p\not=2, can be semi-normalized in L_q for q\not=p, thus extending a classical theorem of Kadets and Pe{\l}czy{\'n}ski from 1968.
