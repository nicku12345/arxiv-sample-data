The Hardy--Littlewood inequality for m-homogeneous polynomials on \ell_{p} spaces is valid for p>m. In this note, among other results, we present an optimal version of this inequality for the case p=m. We also show that the optimal constant, when restricted to the case of 2-homogeneous polynomials on \ell_{2}(\mathbb{R}^{2}) is precisely 2. In an Appendix we justify why, curiously, the optimal exponents of the Hardy--Littlewood inequality do not behave smoothly.
