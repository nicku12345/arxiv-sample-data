We introduce and study the Bourgain index of an operator between two Banach spaces. In particular, we study the Bourgain \ell_p and c_0 indices of an operator. Several estimates for finite and infinite direct sums are established. We define classes determined by these indices and show that some of these classes form operator ideals. We characterize the ordinals which occur as the index of an operator and establish exactly when the defined classes are closed. We study associated indices for non-preservation of \ell_p^\xi and c_0^\xi spreading models and indices characterizing weak compactness of operators between separable Banach spaces. We also show that some of these classes are operator ideals and discuss closedness and distinctness of these classes.
