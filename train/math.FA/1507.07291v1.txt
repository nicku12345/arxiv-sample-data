We study functions whose time-frequency content are concentrated in a compact region in phase space using time-frequency localization operators as a main tool. We obtain approximation inequalities for such functions using a finite linear combination of eigenfunctions of these operators, as well as a local Gabor system covering the region of interest. These would allow the construction of modified time-frequency dictionaries concentrated in the region.
