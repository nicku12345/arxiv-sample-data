The "Up-and-down" theorem which describes the structure of the Boolean algebra of fragments of a linear positive operator is the well known result of the operator theory. We prove an analog of this theorem for a positive abstract Uryson operator defined on a vector lattice and taking values in a Dedekind complete vector lattice. This result we apply to prove that for an order narrow positive abstract Uryson operator T from a vector lattice E to a Dedekind complete vector lattice F, every abstract Uryson operator S:E\to F, such that 0\leq S\leq T is also order narrow.
