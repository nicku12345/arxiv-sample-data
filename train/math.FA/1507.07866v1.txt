In this paper embeddings between weighted Copson function spaces {\operatorname{Cop}}_{p_1,q_1}(u_1,v_1) and weighted Ces\`{a}ro function spaces {\operatorname{Ces}}_{p_2,q_2}(u_2,v_2) are characterized. In particular, two-sided estimates of the optimal constant c in the inequality \begin{equation*} \bigg( \int_0^{\infty} \bigg( \int_0^t f(\tau)^{p_2}v_2(\tau)\,d\tau\bigg)^{\frac{q_2}{p_2}} u_2(t)\,dt\bigg)^{\frac{1}{q_2}} \le c \bigg( \int_0^{\infty} \bigg( \int_t^{\infty} f(\tau)^{p_1} v_1(\tau)\,d\tau\bigg)^{\frac{q_1}{p_1}} u_1(t)\,dt\bigg)^{\frac{1}{q_1}}, \end{equation*} where p_1,\,p_2,\,q_1,\,q_2 \in (0,\infty), p_2 \le q_2 and u_1,\,u_2,\,v_1,\,v_2 are weights on (0,\infty), are obtained. The most innovative part consists of the fact that possibly different parameters p_1 and p_2 and possibly different inner weights v_1 and v_2 are allowed. The proof is based on the combination duality techniques with estimates of optimal constants of the embeddings between weighted Ces\`{a}ro and Copson spaces and weighted Lebesgue spaces, which reduce the problem to the solutions of the iterated Hardy-type inequalities.
