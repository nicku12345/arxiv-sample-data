We provide sufficient and necessary conditions guaranteeing equations (A+B)^*=A^*+B^* and (AB)^*=B^*A^* concerning densely defined unbounded operators A,B between Hilbert spaces. We also improve the perturbation theory of selfadjoint and essentially selfadjoint operators due to Nelson, Kato, Rellich, and W\"ust. Our method involves the range of two-by-two matrices of the form M_{S,T}=\left(\begin{array}{cc}\!\! I & -T\!\!\\ \!\! S& I\!\!\end{array}\right) that makes it possible to treat real and complex Hilbert spaces jointly.
