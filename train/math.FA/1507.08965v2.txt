We study a pair p,e consisting of a projection p (an idempotent) and an effect e (an element between 0 and 1) in a synaptic algebra (a generalization of the self-adjoint part of a von Neumann algebra). We show that some of Halmos's theory of two projections (or two subspaces), including a version of his CS-decomposition theorem, applieas on this settinh, and we introduce and study two candidates for a commutator for p and e.
