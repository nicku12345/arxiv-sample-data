We show that norms on certain Banach spaces X can be approximated uniformly, and with arbitrary precision, on bounded subsets of X by C^{\infty} smooth norms and polyhedral norms. In particular, we show that this holds for any equivalent norm on c_0(\Gamma), where \Gamma is an arbitrary set. We also give a necessary condition for the existence of a polyhedral norm on a weakly compactly generated Banach space, which extends a well-known result of Fonf.
