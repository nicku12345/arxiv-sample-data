We investigate the asymptotic behaviour of entropy and approximation numbers of the compact embedding E^m_{p,\sigma}(B)\hookrightarrow L_p(B), 1\leq p<\infty, defined on the unit ball B in \mathbb{R}^n. Here E^m_{p,\sigma}(B) denotes a Sobolev space with a power weight perturbed by a logarithmic function. The weight contains a singularity at the origin. Inspired by Evans and Harris, we apply a bracketing technique which is an analogue to that of Dirichlet-Neumann-bracketing used by Triebel if p=2.
