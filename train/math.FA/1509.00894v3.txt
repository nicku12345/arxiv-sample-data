Associated with two Banach algebras \mathcal A and \mathcal B and a norm decreasing homomorphism T:{\mathcal B}\rightarrow{\mathcal A}, there is a certain Banach algebra product {\mathcal A}\times_T {\mathcal B}, which is a splitting extension of \mathcal B by \mathcal A. We investigate some notions of amenability such as approximate weak amenability, approximate cyclic amenability, ideal amenability, approximate Connes-amenability, Pseudo-Connes amenability, w^*-approximate Connes-amenability, essential amenability, essential \phi-amenability and essential character amenability. In particular, we improve the previous results for cyclic amenability of {\mathcal A}\times_T {\mathcal B}.
