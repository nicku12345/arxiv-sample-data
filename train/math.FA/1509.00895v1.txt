In this paper, we characterize the (left) multiplier algebra of a semidirect product algebra {\mathcal A}={\mathcal B}\oplus {\mathcal I}, where {\mathcal I} and {\mathcal B} are closed two-sided ideal and closed subalgebra of {\mathcal A}, respectively. As an application of this result we investigate the BSE-property of this class of Banach algebras. We then for two commutative semisimple Banach algebras {\mathcal A} and {\mathcal B} characterize the BSE-functions on the carrier space of {\mathcal A}\times_\phi {\mathcal B}, the \phi-Lau product of {\mathcal A} and {\mathcal B}, in terms of those functions on carrier spaces of {\mathcal A} and {\mathcal B}. We also prove that {\mathcal A}\times_\phi {\mathcal B} is a BSE-algebra if and only if both {\mathcal A} and {\mathcal B} are BSE.
