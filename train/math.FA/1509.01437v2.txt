We show the existence of a family of frames of L^2(\mathbb{R}) which depend on a parameter \alpha\in [0,1]. If \alpha=0, we recover the usual Gabor frame, if \alpha=1 we obtain a frame system which is closely related to the so called DOST basis, first introduced by Stockwell and then analyzed by Battisti and Riba. If \alpha\in (0,1), the frame system is associated to a so called \alpha-partitioning of the frequency domain. Restricting to the case \alpha=1, we provide a truly n-dimensional version of the DOST basis and an associated frame of L^2(\mathbb{R}^d).
