It is well known that on the Hardy space H^2(\mathbb{D}) or weighted Bergman space A^2_{\alpha}(\mathbb{D}) over the unit disk, the adjoint of a linear fractional composition operator equals the product of a composition operator and two Toeplitz operators. On S^2(\mathbb{D}), the space of analytic functions on the disk whose first derivatives belong to H^2(\mathbb{D}), Heller showed that a similar formula holds modulo the ideal of compact operators. In this paper we investigate what the situation is like on other weighted Hardy spaces.
