For a locally convex ^*-algebra A equipped with a fixed continuous ^*-character \varepsilon, we define a cohomological property, called property (FH), which is similar to character amenability. Let C_c(G) be the space of continuous functions on a second countable locally compact group G with compact supports, equipped with the convolution ^*-algebra structure and a certain inductive topology. We show that (C_c(G), \varepsilon_G) has property (FH) if and only if G has property (T). On the other hand, many Banach algebras equipped with canonical characters have property (FH) (e.g., those defined by a nice locally compact quantum group). Furthermore, through our studies on both property (FH) and character amenablility, we obtain characterizations of property (T), amenability and compactness of G in terms of the vanishing of one-sided cohomology of certain topological algebras, as well as in terms of fixed point properties. These characterizations can be regarded as analogues of one another. Moreover, we show that G is compact if and only if the normed algebra \big\{f\in C_c(G): \int_G f(t)dt =0\big\} (under \|\cdot\|_{L^1(G)}) admits a bounded approximate identity with the supports of all its elements being contained in a common compact set.
