Let A and B be Banach algebras and let T be an algebra homomorphism from B into A. The Cartesian product space A\times B by T- Lau product and \ell^{1}- norm becomes a Banach algebra A\times_{T}B. We investigate the notions such as injectivity, projectivity and flatness for the Banach algebra A\times_{T}B. We also characterize Hochschild cohomology for the Banach algebra A\times_{T}B.
