We obtain characterizations of asymptotic properties of Schwartz distribution by using Gabor frames. Our characterizations are indeed Tauberian theorems for shift asymptotics (S-asymptotics) in terms of short-time Fourier transforms with respect to windows generating Gabor frames. For it, we show that the Gabor coefficient operator provides (topological) isomorphisms of the spaces of tempered distributions \mathcal{S}'(\mathbb{R}^d) and distributions of exponential type \mathcal{K}'_{1}(\mathbb{R}^{d}) onto their images.
