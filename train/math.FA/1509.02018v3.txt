In this paper, using generalized metric projection, we propose a new extragradient method for finding a common element of the solutions set of a generalized equilibrium problem and a variational inequality for an \alpha-inverse-strongly monotone operator and fixed points of two relatively nonexpansive mappings in Banach spaces. We prove strong convergence theorems by this method under suitable conditions. A numerical example is given to illustrate the usability of our results.
