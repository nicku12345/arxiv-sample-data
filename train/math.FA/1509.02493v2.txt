Let E and G be two Banach function spaces, let T \in \mathcal{L}(E,Y), and let {\langle X,Y \rangle} be a Banach dual pair. In this paper we give conditions for which there exists a (necessarily unique) bounded linear operator T_{Y} \in \mathcal{L}(E(Y),G(Y)) with the property that \[ {\langle x,T_{Y}e \rangle} = T{\langle x,e \rangle}, \quad\quad\quad e \in E(Y), x \in X. \]   Our first main result states that, in case {\langle X,Y \rangle} = {\langle Y^{*}, Y \rangle} with Y a reflexive Banach space, for the existence of T_{Y} it sufficient that T is dominated by a positive operator.   Our second main result concerns the case that T is an adjoint operator on L^{\infty}(A): we suppose that E = L^{\infty}(A) for a semi-finite measure space (A,\mathscr{A},\mu), that {\langle F, G \rangle} is a K\"othe dual pair, and that T is \sigma(L^{\infty}(A),L^{1}(A))-to-\sigma(G,F) continuous. Then T_{Y} exists provided that T is dominated by a positive operator, in which case T_{Y} is \sigma(L^{\infty}(A;Y),L^{1}(A;X))-to-\sigma(G(Y),F \tilde{\otimes} X) continuous; here F \tilde{\otimes} X denotes the closure of F \otimes X in F(X). We also consider situations in which the existence is automatic and we furthermore show that in certain situations it is necessary that T is regular. As an application of this result we consider conditional expectation on Banach space-valued L^{\infty}-spaces.
