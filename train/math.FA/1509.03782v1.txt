We discuss optimal constants of certain projections on subsequences of weakly null sequences. Positive results yield constants arbitrarily close to 1 for Schreier type projections, and arbitrarily close to 1 for Elton type projections under the assumption that the weakly null sequence admits no subsequence generating a c_0 spreading model. As an application, we prove that a weakly null sequence admitting a spreading model not equivalent to the c_0 basis has a quasi-greedy subsequence with quasi-greedy constant arbitrarily close to 1.
