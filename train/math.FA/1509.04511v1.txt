We study spectral measures generated by infinite convolution products of discrete measures generated by Hadamard triples, and we present sufficient conditions for the measures to be spectral, generalizing a criterion by Strichartz. We then study the spectral measures generated by random convolutions of finite atomic measures and rescaling, where the digits are chosen from a finite collection of digit sets. We show that in dimension one, or in higher dimensions under certain conditions, "almost all" such measures generate spectral measures, or, in the case of complete digit sets, translational tiles. Our proofs are based on the study of self-affine spectral measures and tiles generated by Hadamard triples in quasi-product form.
