In this paper, we define the spaces N_{\theta }^{\beta }\left( p,F,\Delta ^{m}\right) , S_{\theta }^{\beta }\left( F,\Delta ^{m}\right) , w_{p}^{\beta }\left( F,\Delta ^{m}\right)  for sequences of fuzzy numbers using generalized difference operator \Delta ^{m} and a lacunary sequence \theta  and give some relations between them, where  \beta \in \left( 0,1\right]  and p>0. Furthermore, in the last section of paper, some inclusion theorems are presented related to the spaces  S_{\theta }^{\beta }\left( F,\Delta ^{m}\right)  and w_{p}^{\beta }\left( \theta ,f,F,\Delta ^{m}\right)  according to modulus function f.
