This paper presents a number of Kantorovich type integral inequalities involving tensor products of continuous fields of bounded linear operators on a Hilbert space. Kantorovich type inequality in which the product is replaced by an operator mean is also considered. Such inequalities include discrete inequalities as special cases. Moreover, some generalizations of an additive Gruss integral inequality for operators are obtained.
