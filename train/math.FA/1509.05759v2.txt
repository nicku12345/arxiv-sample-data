We study the algebra \mathscr{E}'(\mathbb{R}^d) equipped with the multiplication (T\star S)(f)=T_x(S_y(f(xy)) where xy=(x_1y_1,\dots,x_dy_d). This allows us a very elegant access to the theory of Hadamard type operators on C^\infty(\Omega), \Omega open in \mathbb{R}^d, that is, of operators which admit all monomials as eigenvectors. We obtain a representation of the algebra of such operators as an algebra of holomorphic functions with classical Hadamard multiplication. Finally we study global solvability for such operators on open subsets of \mathbb{R}_+^d.
