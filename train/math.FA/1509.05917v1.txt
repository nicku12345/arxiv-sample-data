Relatively recently, K.M.R. Audenaert (2010), R.A. Horn and F. Zhang (2010), Z. Huang (2011), A.R. Schep (2011), A. Peperko (2012), D. Chen and Y. Zhang (2015) have proved inequalities on the spectral radius and the operator norm of Hadamard products and ordinary matrix products of finite and infinite non-negative matrices that define operators on sequence spaces. In the current paper we extend and refine several of these results and also prove some analogues for the numerical radius. Some inequalities seem to be new even in the case of n\times n non-negative matrices.
