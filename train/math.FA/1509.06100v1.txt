We give a generalization of the Beurling-Lax theorem both in the complex and quaternionic settings. We consider in the first case functions meromorphic in the right complex half-plane, and functions slice hypermeromorphic in the right quaternionic half-space in the second case. In both settings we also discuss a unified framework, which includes both the disk and the half-plane for the complex case and the open unit ball and the half-space in the quaternionic setting.
