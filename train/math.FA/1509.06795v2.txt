In this paper we study the properties of the normal cone to the proximally smooth set. We give the complete characterization of the proximally smooth set through the monotony properties of its normal cone in an arbitrary uniformly convex and uniformly smooth Banach space. We give the exact bounds for right-hand side in the monotonicity inequality for normal cone in terms of the moduli of smoothness and convexity of a Banach space.
