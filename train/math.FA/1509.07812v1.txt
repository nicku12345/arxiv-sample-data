In the present paper, some sufficient and necessary conditions for two frames \Phi=(\varphi_n)_n and \Psi=(\psi_n)_n under which they are approximately or generalized dual frames are determined depending on the properties of their analysis and synthesis operators. We also give a new characterization for approximately dual frames associated with a given frame and given operator by using of bounded operators. Among other things, we prove that if two frames \Phi=(\varphi_n)_n and \Psi=(\psi_n)_n are close to each other, then we can find approximately dual frames \Phi^{ad}=(\varphi^{ad}_n)_n and \Psi^{ad}=(\psi^{ad}_n)_n of them which are close to each other and T_\Phi U_{\Phi^{ad}}=T_\Psi U_{\Psi^{ad}}, where T_\Phi and T_\Psi (resp. U_{\Phi^{ad}} and U_{\Psi^{ad}}) are the analysis operators (resp. synthesis operators) of the frames \Phi and \Psi (resp. \Phi^{ad} and \Psi^{ad}), respectively. We then give some consequences on generalized dual frames. Finally, we apply these results to find some construction results for approximately dual frames for a given Gabor frame.
