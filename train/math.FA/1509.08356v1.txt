We prove that a Volterra-type integral operator T_gf(z) = \int_0^z f(\zeta)g'(\zeta)d\zeta, \, z \in \mathbb D, defined on Hardy spaces H^p, \, 1 \le p < \infty, fixes an isomorphic copy of \ell^p, if the operator T_g is not compact. In particular, this shows that the strict singularity of the operator T_g coincides with the compactness of the operator T_g on spaces H^p. As a consequence, we obtain a new proof for the equivalence of the compactness and the weak compactness of the operator T_g on H^1.
