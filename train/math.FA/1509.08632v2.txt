If \psi is analytic on the open unit disk \mathbb{D} and \varphi is an analytic self-map of \mathbb{D}, the weighted composition operator C_{\psi,\varphi} is defined by C_{\psi,\varphi}f(z)=\psi(z)f (\varphi (z)), when f is analytic on \mathbb{D}. In this paper, we study normal, cohyponormal, hyponormal and normaloid weighted composition operators on the Hardy and weighted Bergman spaces. First, for some weighted Hardy spaces H^{2}(\beta), we prove that if C_{\psi,\varphi} is cohyponormal on H^{2}(\beta), then \psi never vanishes on \mathbb{D} and \varphi is univalent, when \psi \not \equiv 0 and \varphi is not a constant function. Moreover, for \psi=K_{a}, where |a| < 1, we investigate normal, cohyponormal and hyponormal weighted composition operators C_{\psi,\varphi}. After that, for \varphi  which is a hyperbolic or parabolic automorphism, we characterize all normal weighted composition operators C_{\psi,\varphi}, when \psi \not \equiv 0 and \psi is analytic on \overline{\mathbb{D}}.   Finally, we find all normal weighted composition operators which are bounded below.
