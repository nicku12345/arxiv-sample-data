The aim of this article is to extend results of M.~Popov and second named author about orthogonally additive narrow operators on vector lattices. The main object of our investigations are an orthogonally additive narrow operators between lattice-normed spaces. We prove that every C-compact laterally-to-norm continuous orthogonally additive operator from a Banach-Kantorovich space V to a Banach lattice Y is narrow. We also show that every dominated Uryson operator from Banach-Kantorovich space over an atomless Dedekind complete vector lattice E to a sequence Banach lattice \ell_p(\Gamma) or c_0(\Gamma) is narrow. Finally, we prove that if an orthogonally additive dominated operator T from lattice-normed space (V,E) to Banach-Kantorovich space (W,F) is order narrow then the order narrow is its exact dominant \ls T\rs.
