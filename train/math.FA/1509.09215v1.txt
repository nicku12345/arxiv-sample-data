Let A be a commutative Banach algebra and X be a compact space. The class of Banach A-valued function algebras on X consists of subalgebras of C(X,A) with certain properties. We introduce the notion of A-characters on an A-valued function algebra \A as homomorphisms from \A into A that basically have the same properties as the evaluation homomorphisms \cE_x:f\mapsto f(x), with x\in X. For the so-called natural A-valued function algebras, such as C(X,A) and \Lip(X,A), we show that \cE_x (x\in X) are the only A-characters. Vector-valued characters are utilized to identify vector-valued spectrums. When A=\C, Banach A-valued function algebras reduce to Banach function algebras, and A-characters reduce to characters.
