The properties of Volterra-composition operators on the weighted Bergman space with exponential type weights are investigated in this paper. We state some necessary and sufficient conditions that a Volterra-composition operator from the weighted Bergman space to Bloch type space ( or little Bloch type space ) must satisfy for the Volterra-composition operator to be bounded or compact.
