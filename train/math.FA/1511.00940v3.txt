Noting the important role the abstract L^p space has played in the development of random normed modules, in this paper we introduce and study the Orlicz space generated from a random normed module. First, we give a basic dual space representation theorem which identify the dual of the Orlicz heart of a random normed module with the Orlicz space generated from the random conjugate space. Then, we establish the respective equivalence relations of the strict convexity and uniform convexity of this abstract Orlicz space to the random strict convexity and random uniform convexity of the underlying random normed module. These results demonstrate that it is possible to use the Orlicz space theory in the further development of random nomed modules.
