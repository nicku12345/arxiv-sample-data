We extend the notion of John's ellipsoid to the setting of integrable log-concave functions. This will allow us to define the integral ratio of a log-concave function, which will extend the notion of volume ratio, and we will find the log-concave function maximizing the integral ratio. A reverse functional affine isoperimetric inequality will be given, written in terms of this integral ratio. This can be viewed as a stability version of the functional affine isoperimetric inequality.
