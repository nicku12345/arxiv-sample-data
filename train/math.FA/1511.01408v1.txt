A Banach space operator A\in B({\cal{X}}) is polaroid, A\in {\cal{P}}, if the isolated points of the spectrum \sigma(A) are poles of the operator; A is hereditarily polaroid, A\in{\cal{HP}}, if every restriction of A to a closed invariant subspace is polaroid. Operators A\in{\cal{HP}} have SVEP on \Phi_{sf}(A)=\{\lambda: A-\lambda is semi Fredholm \}: This, in answer to a question posed by Li and Zhou (Studia Math. 221(2014), 175-192), proves the necessity of the condition \Phi_{sf}^+(A)=\emptyset. A sufficient condition for A\in B({\cal{X}}) to have SVEP on \Phi_{sf}(A) is that its component \Omega_a(A)=\{\lambda\in\Phi_{sf}(A): \rm{ind}(A-\lambda)\leq 0\} is connected. We prove: If A\in B({\cal{H}}) is a Hilbert space operator, then a necessary and sufficient condition for there to exist a compact operator K such that A+K\in{\cal{HP}} is that \Omega_a(A) is connected.
