In a recent paper we introduced sine functions on commutative hypergroups. These functions are natural generalizations of those functions on groups which are products of additive and multiplicative homomorphisms. In this paper we describe sine functions on different types of hypergroups, including polynomial hypergroups, Sturm--Liouville hypergroups, etc. A non-commutative hypergroup is also considered.
