In this paper, the fractional Hardy-type operator of variable order \beta(x) is shown to be bounded from the variable exponent Herz-Morrey spaces M\dot{K}_{p_{_{1}},q_{_{1}}(\cdot)}^{\alpha(\cdot),\lambda}(\R^{n}) into the weighted space M\dot{K}_{p_{_{2}},q_{_{2}}(\cdot)}^{\alpha(\cdot),\lambda}(\R^{n},\omega), where \alpha(x)\in L^{\infty}(\mathbb{R}^{n}) be log-H\"older continuous both at the origin and at infinity, \omega=(1+|x|)^{-\gamma(x)} with some \gamma(x)>0 and  1/q_{_{1}}(x)-1/q_{_{2}}(x)=\beta(x)/n when q_{_{1}}(x) is not necessarily constant at infinity.
