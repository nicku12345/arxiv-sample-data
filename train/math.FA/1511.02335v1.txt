Let X(\mu) be a function space related to a measure space (\Omega,\Sigma,\mu) with \chi_\Omega\in X(\mu) and let T\colon X(\mu)\to E be a Banach space valued operator. It is known that if T is p-th power factorable then the largest function space to which T can be extended preserving p-th power factorability is given by the space L^p(m_T) of p-integrable functions with respect to m_T, where m_T\colon\Sigma\to E is the vector measure associated to T via m_T(A)=T(\chi_A). In this paper we extend this result by removing the restriction \chi_\Omega\in X(\mu). In this general case, by considering m_T defined on a certain \delta-ring, we show that the optimal domain for T is the space L^p(m_T)\cap L^1(m_T). We apply the obtained results to the particular case when T is a map between sequence spaces defined by an infinite matrix.
