We show that there are no nontrivial surjective uniformly asymptotically regular mappings acting on a metric space and derive some consequences of this fact. In particular, we prove that a jointly continuous left amenable or left reversible semigroup generated by firmly nonexpansive mappings on a bounded \tau-compact subset of a Banach space has a common fixed point, and give a qualitative complement to the Markov-Kakutani theorem.
