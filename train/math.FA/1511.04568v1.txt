Let A be a complex, commutative unital Banach algebra. We introduce two notions of exponential reducibility of Banach algebra tuples and present an analogue to the Corach-Su\'arez result on the connection between reducibility in A and in C(M(A)). Our methods are of an analytical nature. Necessary and sufficient geometric/topological conditions are given for reducibility (respectively reducibility to the principal component of U_n(A)) whenever the spectrum of A is homeomorphic to a subset of \mathbb C^n.
