In this article, we prove that a compact open set in the field \mathbb{Q}_p of p-adic numbers is a spectral set if and only if it tiles \mathbb{Q}_p by translation, and also if and only if it is p-homogeneous which is easy to check. We also characterize spectral sets in \mathbb{Z}/p^n \mathbb{Z} (p\ge 2 prime, n\ge 1 integer) by tiling property and also by homogeneity. Moreover, we construct a class of singular spectral measures in \mathbb{Q}_p, some of which are self-similar measures.
