Associated with a locally compact group \cal G and a \cal G-space \cal X there is a Banach subspace LUC({\cal X},{\cal G}) of C_b({\cal X}), which has been introduced and studied by Lau and Chu in \cite{chulau}. In this paper, we study some properties of the first dual space of LUC({\cal X},{\cal G}). In particular, we introduce a left action of LUC({\cal G})^* on LUC({\cal X},{\cal G})^* to make it a Banach left module and then we investigate the Banach subalgebra {{\frak{Z}}({\cal X},{\cal G})} of LUC({\cal G})^*, as the topological centre related to this module action, which contains M({\cal G}) as a closed subalgebra. Also, we show that the faithfulness of this module action is related to the properties of the action of \cal G on \cal X and we extend the main results of Lau~\cite{lau} from locally compact groups to {\cal G}-spaces. Sufficient and/or necessary conditions for the equality {{\frak{Z}}({\cal X},{\cal G})}=M({\cal G}) or LUC({\cal G})^* are given. Finally, we apply our results to some special cases of \cal G and \cal X for obtaining various examples whose topological centres {{\frak{Z}}({\cal X},{\cal G})} are M({\cal G}), LUC({\cal G})^* or neither of them.
