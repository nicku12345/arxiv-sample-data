We study how well a quasi-Banach space can be coarsely embedded into a Hilbert space. Given any quasi-Banach space X which coarsely embeds into a Hilbert space, we compute its Hilbert space compression exponent. We also show that the Hilbert space compression exponent of X is equal to the supremum of the amounts of snowflakings of X which admit a bi-Lipschitz embedding into a Hilbert space.
