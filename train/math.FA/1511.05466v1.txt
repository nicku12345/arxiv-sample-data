The notions of Bessel sequence, Riesz-Fischer sequence and Riesz basis are generalized to a rigged Hilbert space \D[t] \subset \H \subset \D^\times[t^\times]. A Riesz-like basis, in particular, is obtained by considering a sequence \{\xi_n\}\subset \D which is mapped by a one-to-one continuous operator T:\D[t]\to\H[\|\cdot\|] into an orthonormal basis of the central Hilbert space \H of the triplet. The operator T is, in general, an unbounded operator in \H. If T has a bounded inverse then the rigged Hilbert space is shown to be equivalent to a triplet of Hilbert spaces.
