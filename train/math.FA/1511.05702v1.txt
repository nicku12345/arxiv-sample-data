The purpose of this paper is to study algebras of singular integral operators on \mathbb{R}^{n} and nilpotent Lie groups that arise when one considers the composition of Calder\'on-Zygmund operators with different homogeneities, such as operators that occur in sub-elliptic problems and those arising in elliptic problems. For example, one would like to describe the algebras containing the operators related to the Kohn-Laplacian for appropriate domains, or those related to inverses of H\"ormander sub-Laplacians, when these are composed with the more standard class of pseudo-differential operators. The algebras we study can be characterized in a number of different but equivalent ways, and consist of operators that are pseudo-local and bounded on L^{p} for 1<p<\infty. While the usual class of Calder\'on-Zygmund operators is invariant under a one-parameter family of dilations, the operators we study fall outside this class, and reflect a multi-parameter structure.
