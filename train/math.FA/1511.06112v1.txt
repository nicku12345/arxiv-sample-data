We precisely evaluate Bellman type functions for the dyadic maximal opeator on R^n and of maximal operators on martingales related to local Lorentz type estimates. Using a type of symmetrization principle, introduced for the dyadic maximal operator in earlier works of the authors we precisely evaluate the supremum of the Lorentz quasinorm of the maximal operator on a function \phi when the integral of \phi is fixed and also the same Lorentz quasinorm of \phi is fixed. Also we find the corresponding supremum when the integral of \phi is fixed and several weak type conditions are given.
