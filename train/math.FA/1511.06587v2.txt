In this paper, we introduce the concept of operator arithmetic-geometrically convex functions for positive linear operators and prove some Hermite-Hadamard type inequalities for these functions. As applications, we obtain trace inequalities for operators which give some refinements of previous results. Moreover, some unitarily invariant norm inequalities are established.
