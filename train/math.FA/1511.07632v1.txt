We prove that the c_0-sum of separable Banach spaces with uniformly summable Szlenk index has summable Szlenk index, whereas this result is no longer valid for more general direct sums. We also give a formula for the Szlenk power type of the \mathfrak{E}-direct sum of separable spaces provided that \mathfrak{E} has a shrinking unconditional basis whose dual basis yields an asymptotic \ell_p structure in \mathfrak{E}^\ast. As a corollary, we show that the Tsirelson direct sum of infinitely many copies of c_0 has power type 1 but non-summable Szlenk index.
