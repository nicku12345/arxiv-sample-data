Several papers have, as their raison d'etre, the exploration of the \emph{generalized Lau product} associated to a homomorphism T:B\to A of Banach algebras. In this short note, we demonstrate that the generalized Lau product is isomorphic as a Banach algebra to the usual direct product A\oplus B. We also correct some misleading claims made about the relationship between this generalized Lau product, and an older construction of Monfared (Studia Mathematica, 2007).
