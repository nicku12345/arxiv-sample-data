We study continuous linear operators on \mathscr{D}'(\mathbb{R}^d) which admit all monomials as eigenvectors, that is, operators of Hadamard type. Such operators on C^\infty(\mathbb{R}^d) and on the space A(\mathbb{R}^d) of real analytic functions on \mathbb{R}^d have been investigated by Domanski, Langenbruch and the author. The situation in the present case, however, is quite different and also the characterization. An operator L on \mathscr{D}'(\mathbb{R}^d) is of Hadamard type if there is a distribution T, the support of which has positive distance to all coordinate hyperplanes and which has a certain behaviour at infinity, such that L(S) = S \star T for all S \in \mathscr{D}'(\mathbb{R}^d). Here (S \star T)\varphi = S_y(T_x \varphi(xy)) for all \varphi \in \mathscr{D}(\mathbb{R}^d). To describe the behaviour at infinity we introduce a class \mathscr{O}_H'(\mathbb{R}^d) of distributions defined by the same conditions like in the description of class \mathscr{O}_C'(\mathbb{R}^d) of Laurent Schwartz, but derivatives replaced with Euler derivatives.
