We consider a large class of operator means and prove that a number of ergodic theorems, as well as growth estimates known for particular cases, continue to hold in the general context under fairly mild regularity conditions. The methods developed in the paper not only yield a new approach based on a general point of view, but also lead to results that are new, even in the context of the classical Cesaro means.
