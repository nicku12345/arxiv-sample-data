We prove some infinite series identities for the Hermite functions. From these identities we disprove the Gabor frame set conjecture for Hermite functions of order 4m+2 and 4m+3 for m \in \{0\} \cup \mathbb{N}. The results hold not only for Hermite functions, but for two large classes of eigenfunctions of the Fourier transform associated with the eigenvalues -1 and i, and the results indicate that the Gabor frame set of all such functions must have a rather complicated structure.
