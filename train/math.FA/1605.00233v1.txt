We prove that in any Sobolev space which is subcritical with respect to the Sobolev Embedding Theorem there exists a closed infinite dimensional linear subspace whose non zero elements are nowhere bounded functions. We also prove the existence of a closed infinite dimensional linear subspace whose non zero elements are nowhere L^q functions for suitable values of q larger than the Sobolev exponent.
