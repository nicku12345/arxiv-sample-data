In this article, we study a version of the Bishop-Phelps-Bollob\'as property. We investigate a pair of Banach spaces (X, Y) such that every operator from X into Y is approximated by operators which attains its norm at the same point where the original operator almost attains its norm. In this case, we say that such a pair has the Bishop-Phelps-Bollob\'as point property (BPBpp). We characterize uniform smoothness in terms of BPBpp and we give some examples of pairs (X, Y) which have and fail this property. Some stability results are obtained about \ell_1 and \ell_\infty sums of Banach spaces and we also study this property for bilinear mappings.
