Fusion frames are valuable generalizations of discrete frames. Most concepts of fusion frames are shared by discrete frames. However, the dual setting is so complicated. In particular, unlike discrete frames, two fusion frames are not dual of each other in general. In this paper, we investigate the structure of the duals of fusion frames and discuss the relation between the duals of fusion frames with their associated discrete frames.
