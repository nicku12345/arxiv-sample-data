In this paper we consider the notion of strong I-statistically pre-Cauchy double sequences in probabilistic metric spaces in line of Das et. al. [6] and introduce the new concept of strong I^*-statistically pre-Cauchy double sequences in real line as well as in probabilistic metric spaces. We mainly study inter relationship among strong I-statistical convergence, strong I-statistical pre-Cauchy condition and strong I^*-statistical pre-Cauchy condition for double sequences in probabilistic metric spaces and examine some basic properties of these notions.
