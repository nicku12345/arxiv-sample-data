Dunkl operators are differential-difference operators parametrized by a finite reflection group and a weight function. The commutative algebra generated by these operators generalizes the algebra of standard differential operators and intertwines with this latter by the so-called intertwining operator. In this paper, we give an integral representation for the operator V_k\circ e^{\Delta/2} for an arbitrary Weyl group and a large class of regular weights k containing those of non negative real parts. Our representing measures are absolute continuous with respect the Lebesgue measure in \Rd, which allows us to derive out new results about the intertwining operator V_k and the Dunkl kernel E_k. We show in particular that the operator V_k\circ e^{\Delta/2} extends uniquely as a bounded operator to a large class of functions which are not necessarily differentiables. In the case of non negative weights, this operator is shown to be positivity-preserving.
