We shall say that a bounded linear operator T acting on a Banach space X admits a generalized Kato-Riesz decomposition if there exists a pair of T-invariant closed subspaces (M,N) such that X=M\oplus N, the reduction T_M is Kato and T_N is Riesz. In this paper we define and investigate the generalized Kato-Riesz spectrum of an operator. For T is said to be generalized Drazin-Riesz invertible if there exists a bounded linear operator S  acting on X such that TS=ST, STS=S,  TST-T is Riesz. We investigate generalized Drazin-Riesz invertible operators and also, characterize bounded linear operators which can be expressed as a direct sum of a Riesz operator and a bounded below (resp. surjective, upper (lower) semi-Fredholm, Fredholm, upper (lower) semi-Weyl, Weyl) operator. In particular we characterize the single-valued extension property at a point \lambda_0\in{\mathbb C} in the case that \lambda_0-T admits a generalized Kato-Riesz decomposition.
