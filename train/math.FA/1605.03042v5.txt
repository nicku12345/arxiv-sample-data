We extend Feichtinger's minimality property on smallest non-trivial time-frequency shift invariant Banach spaces, to the quasi-Banach case. Analogous properties are deduced for certain matrix classes.   We use these results to prove that \operatorname{Op}(a) is a Schatten-q operator from M^\infty to M^p and r-nuclear operator from M^\infty to M^r when a\in M^r for suitable p, q and r in (0,\infty ].
