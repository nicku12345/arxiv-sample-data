Given a lattice \Lambda in a locally compact abelian group G and a measurable subset \Omega with finite and positive measure, then the set of characters associated to the dual lattice form a frame for L^2(\Omega) if and only if the distinct translates by \Lambda of \Omega have almost empty intersections. Some consequences of this results are the well-known Fuglede theorem for lattices, as well as a simple characterization for frames of modulates.
