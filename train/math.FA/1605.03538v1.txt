A net (x_\alpha) in a vector lattice X is unbounded order convergent to x \in X if \lvert x_\alpha - x\rvert \wedge u converges to 0 in order for all u\in X_+. This convergence has been investigated and applied in several recent papers by Gao et al. It may be viewed as a generalization of almost everywhere convergence to general vector lattices. In this paper, we study a variation of this convergence for Banach lattices. A net (x_\alpha) in a Banach lattice X is unbounded norm convergent to x if \lVert\lvert x_\alpha - x\rvert \wedge u\rVert\to 0 for all u\in X_+. We show that this convergence may be viewed as a generalization of convergence in measure. We also investigate its relationship with other convergences.
