We consider the cardinal invariant bd defined by M. D\v{z}amonja and I. Juh\'asz concerning bidiscrete systems. Using the relation between bidiscrete systems and irredundance for a compact Hausdorff space K, we prove that {w(K)\leq bd(K)\cdot hL(K)^+}, generalizing a result of S. Todorcevic concerning the irredundance in Boolean algebras and we prove that for every maximal irredundant family \mathcal{F}\subset C(K), there is a \pi-base \mathcal{B} for K with |\mathcal{F}|=|\mathcal{B}|, a result analogous to the McKenzie Theorem for Boolean algebras in the context of compact spaces. In particular, it is a consequence of the latter result that \pi(K)\leq bd(K) for every compact Hausdorff space K. From the relation between bidiscrete systems and biorthogonal systems, we obtain some results about biorthogonal systems in Banach spaces of the form C(K).
