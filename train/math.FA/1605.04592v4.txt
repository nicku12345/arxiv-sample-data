This paper contains two improvements on a theorem of S. N. Bernstein for Banach spaces. We show that if X is an arbitrary infinite-dimensional Banach space, \{Y_n\} is a sequence of strictly nested subspaces of  X and if \{d_n\} is a non-increasing sequence of non-negative numbers tending to 0, then for any c\in(0,1] we can find x_{c} \in X, such that the distance \rho(x_{c}, Y_n) from x_{c} to Y_n satisfies  c d_n \leq \rho(x_{c},Y_n) \leq 4c d_n,~\mbox{for all n\in\mathbb N}.  We prove the above inequality by first improving Borodin (2006)'s result for Banach spaces by weakening his condition on the sequence \{d_n\}. The weakened condition on d_n requires refinement of Borodin's construction to extract an element in X, whose distances from the nested subspaces are precisely the given values d_n.
