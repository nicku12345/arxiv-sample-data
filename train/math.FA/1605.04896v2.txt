Given a compact space X and a commutative Banach algebra A, the character spaces of A-valued function algebras on X are investigated. The class of natural A-valued function algebras, those whose characters can be described by means of characters of A and point evaluation homomorphisms, is introduced and studied. For an admissible Banach A-valued function algebra \mathcal{A} on X, conditions under which the character space M(\mathcal{A}) is homeomorphic to M(\mathfrak{A}) \times M(A) are presented, where \mathfrak{A}=C(X) \cap \mathcal{A} is the subalgebra of \mathcal{A} consisting of scalar-valued functions. An illustration of the results is given by some examples.
