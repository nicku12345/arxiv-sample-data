The paper introduces the concept of quasimeasure of noncompactness. Motivated by the Arzel\`a-Ascoli theorem for C^b(X,E), where X is an Euclidean space and E an arbitrary Banach space, we construct a quasimeasure for this space and study its properties. An analogon for Darbo fixed point theorem is obtained with the additional aid of measure of nonconvexity. The paper ends with possible application in integral equations. We prove that a Hammerstein operator with Carath\'{e}odory kernel and nonlinearity of a certain type has a fixed point.
