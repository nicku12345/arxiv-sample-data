In this paper, we prove common fixed point results for a self-mappings satisfying an implicit function which is general enough to cover a multitude of known as well as unknown contractions. Our results modify, unify, extend and generalize many relevant results of the existing literature. Interestingly, unlike several other cases, our main results deduce a nonlinear order-theoretic version of a well-known fixed point theorem (proved for quasi-contraction) due to \'{C}iri\'{c} (Proc. Amer. Math. Soc. (54) 267-273, 1974). Finally, in the setting of metric spaces, we drive a sharpened version of Theorem 1 due to Berinde and Vetro (Fixed Point Theory Appl. 2012:105).
