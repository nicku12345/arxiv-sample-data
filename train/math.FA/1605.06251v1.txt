For locally convex spaces X and Y, the continuous linear map T:X \to Y is called bounded if there is a zero neighborhood U of X such that T(U) is bounded in Y. Our main result is that the existence of an unbounded operator T between Fr\'echet spaces E and F which factors through a third Fr\'echet space G ends up with the fact that the triple (E, G, F) has an infinite dimensional closed common nuclear K\"othe subspace, provided that F has the property (y).
