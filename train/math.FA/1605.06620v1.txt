Given two complex Banach spaces X_1 and X_2, a tensor product of X_1 and X_2, X_1\tilde{\otimes}X_2, in the sense of J. Eschmeier ([5]), and two finite tuples of commuting operators, S=(S_1,\ldots ,S_n) and T=(T_1,\ldots ,T_m), defined on X_1 and X_2 respectively, we consider the (n+m)-tuple of operators defined on X_1\tilde{\otimes}X_2, (S\otimes I,I\otimes T)= (S_1\otimes I,\ldots ,S_n\otimes I,I\otimes T_1,\ldots ,I \otimes T_m), and we give a description of the semi-Browder joint spectra introduced by V. Kordula, V. M\"uller and V. Rako\check{c}evi\acute{ c} in [7] and of the split semi-Browder joint spectra (see section 3), of the (n+m)-tuple (S\otimes I ,I\otimes T), in terms of the corresponding joint spectra of S and T. This result is in some sense a generalization of a formula obtained for other various Browder spectra in Hilbert spaces and for tensor products of operators and for tuples of the form (S\otimes I ,I\otimes T). In addition, we also describe all the mentioned joint spectra for a tuple of left and right multiplications defined on an operator ideal between Banach spaces in the sense of [5].
