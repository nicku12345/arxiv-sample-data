We define and study Toeplitz operators in the space of Herglotz solutions of the Helmholtz equation in R^d. As the most traditional definition of Toeplitz operators via Bergman-type projection is not available here, we use an approach based upon the reproducing kernel nature of the Herglotz space and sesquilinear forms, which results in a meaningful theory. For two important patterns of sesquilinear forms we discuss a number of properties, including the uniqueness of determining the symbols from the operator, the finite rank property, the conditions for boundedness and compactness, spectral properties, certain algebraic relations.
