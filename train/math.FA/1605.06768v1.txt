In this paper we introduce and study a new sequence of positive linear operators acting on function spaces defined on a convex compact subset. Their construction depends on a given Markov operator, a positive real number and a sequence of probability Borel measures. By considering special cases of these parameters for particular convex compact subsets we obtain the classical Kantorovich operators defined in the one-dimensional and multidimensional setting together with several of their wide-ranging generalizations scattered in the literature. We investigate the approximation properties of these operators by also providing several estimates of the rate of convergence. Finally, the preservation of Lipschitz-continuity as well as of convexity are discussed
