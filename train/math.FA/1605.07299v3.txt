Given a bounded normal operator A in a Hilbert space and a fixed vector x, we elaborate on the problem of finding necessary and sufficient conditions under which (A^kx)_{k\in\mathbb N} constitutes a Bessel sequence. We provide a characterization in terms of the measure \|E(\cdot)x\|^2, where E is the spectral measure of the operator A. In the separately treated special cases where A is unitary or selfadjoint we obtain more explicit characterizations. Finally, we apply our results to a sequence (A^kx)_{k\in\mathbb N}, where A arises from the heat equation. The problem is motivated by and related to the new field of Dynamical Sampling which was recently initiated by Aldroubi et al.
