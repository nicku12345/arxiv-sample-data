We identify concrete examples of hypercyclic generalised derivations acting on separable ideals of operators and establish some necessary conditions for their hypercyclicity. We also consider the dynamics of elementary operators acting on particular Banach algebras, which reveals surprising hypercyclic behaviour on the space of bounded linear operators on the Banach space constructed by Argyros and Haydon.
