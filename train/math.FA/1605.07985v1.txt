The article concerns compressed sensing methods in the quaternion algebra. We prove that it is possible to uniquely reconstruct - by \ell_1 norm minimization - a sparse quaternion signal from a limited number of its real linear measurements, provided the measurement matrix satisfies so-called restricted isometry property with a sufficiently small constant. We also provide error estimates for the reconstruction of a non-sparse quaternion signal in the noisy and noiseless cases.
