We prove that for a bounded domain \Omega\subset \mathbb R^n which is Gromov hyperbolic with respect to the quasihyperbolic metric, especially when \Omega is a finitely connected planar domain, the Sobolev space W^{1,\,\infty}(\Omega) is dense in W^{1,\,p}(\Omega) for any 1\le p<\infty. Moreover if \Omega is also Jordan or quasiconvex, then C^{\infty}(\mathbb R^n) is dense in W^{1,\,p}(\Omega) for 1\le p<\infty.
