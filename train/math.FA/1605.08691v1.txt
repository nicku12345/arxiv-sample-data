We construct a family of frames describing Sobolev norm and Sobolev seminorm of the space H^s(\mathbb{R}^d). Our work is inspired by the Discrete Orthonormal Stockwell Transform introduced by R.G. Stockwell, which provides a time-frequency localized version of Fourier basis of L^2([0,1]). This approach is a hybrid between Gabor and Wavelet frames. We construct explicit and computable examples of these frames, discussing their properties.
