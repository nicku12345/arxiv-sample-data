In this paper we develop the theory of Fourier multiplier operators T_{m}:L^{p}(\mathbb{R}^{d};X)\to L^{q}(\mathbb{R}^{d};Y), for Banach spaces X and Y, 1\leq p\leq q\leq \infty and m:\mathbb{R}^d\to \mathcal{L}(X,Y) an operator-valued symbol. The case p=q has been studied extensively since the 1980's, but far less is known for p<q. In the scalar setting one can deduce results for p<q from the case p=q. However, in the vector-valued setting this leads to restrictions both on the smoothness of the multiplier and on the class of Banach spaces. For example, one often needs that X and Y are UMD spaces and that m satisfies a smoothness condition. We show that for p<q other geometric conditions on X and Y, such as the notions of type and cotype, can be used to study Fourier multipliers. Moreover, we obtain boundedness results for T_m without any smoothness properties of m. Under smoothness conditions the boundedness results can be extrapolated to other values of p and q as long as \tfrac{1}{p}-\tfrac{1}{q} remains constant.
