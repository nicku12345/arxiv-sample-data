Classical results due to Ingham and Paley-Wiener characterize the existence of nonzero functions supported on certain subsets of the real line in terms of the pointwise decay of the Fourier transforms. We view these results as uncertainty principles for Fourier transforms. We prove certain analogues of these uncertainty principles on the n-dimensional Euclidean space, the n-dimensional torus and connected, simply connected two step nilpotent Lie groups. We also use these results to show a unique continuation property of solutions to the initial value problem for time-dependent Schr\"odinger equations on the Euclidean space and a class of connected, simply connected two step nilpotent Lie groups.
