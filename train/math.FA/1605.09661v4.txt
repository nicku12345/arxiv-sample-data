In this article M\"untz spaces M_{\Lambda ,C} of continuous functions supplied with the absolute maximum norm are considered. An approximation of functions in M\"untz spaces M_{\Lambda ,C} of continuous functions by Fourier series is studied. An existence of Schauder bases in M\"untz spaces M_{\Lambda ,C} is investigated.
