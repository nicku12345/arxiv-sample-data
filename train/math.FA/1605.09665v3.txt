M\"untz spaces satisfying the M\"untz and gap conditions are considered. A Fourier approximation of functions in the M\"untz spaces M_{\Lambda ,p} of L_p functions is studied, where 1<p<\infty . It is proved that up to an isomorphism and a change of variables these spaces are contained in Weil-Nagy's class. Moreover, existence of Schauder bases in the M\"untz spaces M_{\Lambda ,p} is investigated.
