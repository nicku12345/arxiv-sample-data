Given two systems P=(P_j(D))_{j=1}^N and Q=(Q_j(D))_{j=1}^M of linear partial differential operators with constant coefficients, we consider the spaces {\mathcal E}_\omega^P and {\mathcal E}_\omega^Q of \omega-ultradifferentiable functions with respect to the iterates of the systems P and Q respectively. We find necessary and sufficient conditions, on the systems and on the weights \omega(t) and \sigma(t), for the inclusion {\mathcal E}_\omega^P\subseteq{\mathcal E}_\sigma^Q. As a consequence we have a generalization of the classical Theorem of the Iterates.
