A version of the classical Klee-And\^o Theorem states the following: For every Banach space X, ordered by a closed generating cone C\subseteq X, there exists some \alpha>0 so that, for every x\in X, there exist x^{\pm}\in C so that x=x^{+}-x^{-} and \|x^{+}\|+\|x^{-}\|\leq\alpha\|x\|.   The conclusion of the Klee-And\^o Theorem is what is known as a conormality property.   We prove stronger and somewhat more general versions of the Klee-And\^o Theorem for both conormality and coadditivity (a property that is intimately related to conormality). A corollary to our result shows that the functions x\mapsto x^{\pm}, as above, may be chosen to be bounded, continuous, and positively homogeneous, with a similar conclusion yielded for coadditivity. Furthermore, we show that the Klee-And\^o Theorem generalizes beyond ordered Banach spaces to Banach spaces endowed with arbitrary collections of cones. Proofs of our Klee-And\^o Theorems are achieved through an Open Mapping Theorem for cone-valued multi-functions/correspondences.   We very briefly discuss a potential further strengthening of The Klee-And\^o Theorem beyond what is proven in this paper, and motivate a conjecture that there exists a Banach space X, ordered by a closed generating cone C\subseteq X, for which there exist no Lipschitz functions (\cdot)^{\pm}:X\to C satisfying x=x^{+}-x^{-} for all x\in X.
