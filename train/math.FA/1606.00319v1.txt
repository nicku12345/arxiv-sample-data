We study Banach envelopes for commutative symmetric sequence or function spaces, and noncommutative symmetric spaces of measurable operators. We characterize the class (HC) of quasi-normed symmetric sequence or function spaces E for which their Banach envelopes \widehat{E} are also symmetric spaces. The class of symmetric spaces satisfying (HC) contains but is not limited to order continuous spaces. Let \mathcal{M} be a non-atomic, semifinite von Neumann algebra with a faithful, normal, \sigma-finite trace \tau and E be as symmetric function space on [0,\tau(1)) or symmetric sequence space. We compute Banach envelope norms on E(\mathcal{M},\tau) and C_E for any quasi-normed symmetric space E. Then we show under assumption that E\in (HC) that the Banach envelope \widehat{E(\mathcal{M},\tau)} of E(\mathcal{M},\tau) is equal to \widehat{E}(\mathcal{M},\tau) isometrically. We also prove the analogous result for unitary matrix spaces C_E.
