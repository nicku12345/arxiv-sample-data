We prove that the cartesian product of octahedra B_{1,\infty}^{n,m}=B_1^n\times\ldots\times B_1^n (m octahedra) is badly approximated by half--dimensional subspaces in mixed--norm: d_{N/2}(B_{1,\infty}^{n,m},\ell_{2,1}^{n,m})\ge cm, N=mn. As a corollary the orders for linear widths of H\"older--Nikolskii classes H^r_p(\mathbb T^d) in the L_q metric are obtained for (p,q) in a certain set (a domain in the parameter space).
