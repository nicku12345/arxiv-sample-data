Given an Orlicz N-function \varphi and a positive decreasing weight w, we present criteria of the diameter two property and of the Radon-Nikod\'ym property in Orlicz-Lorentz function and sequence spaces \Lambda_{\varphi,w} and \lambda_{\varphi,w}. We show that in the spaces \Lambda_{\varphi,w} or \lambda_{\varphi,w} equipped with the Luxemburg norm, the diameter of any relatively weakly subset of the unit ball in these spaces is two if and only if \varphi does not satisfy the appropriate \Delta_2 condition, while they have the Radon-Nikod\'ym property if and only if \varphi satisfies the appropriate \Delta_2 condition.
