We consider the modulus of noncompact convexity \Delta_{X,\phi}(\varepsilon) associated with the minimalizable measure of noncompactness \phi. We present some properties of this modulus, while the main result of this paper is showing that \Delta_{X,\phi }(\varepsilon) is a subhomogenous and continuous function on [0,\phi (\bar{B}_X)) for an arbitrary minimalizable measure of compactness \phi in the case of a Banach space X with the Radon-Nikodym property.
