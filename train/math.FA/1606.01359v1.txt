We investigate sufficient and necessary conditions for the space of bounded linear operators between two Banach spaces to be rough or average rough. Our main result is that \mathcal L(X,Y) is \delta-average rough whenever X^\ast is \delta-average rough and Y is alternatively octahedral. This allows us to give a unified improvement of two theorems by Becerra Guerrero, L\'opez-P\'erez, and Rueda Zoca [J. Math. Anal. Appl. 427 (2015)].
