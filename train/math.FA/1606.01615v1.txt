In this paper, using sunny generalized nonexpansive retraction, we propose new extragradient and linesearch algorithms for finding a common element of the set of solutions of an equilibrium problem and the set of fixed points of a relatively nonexpansive mapping in Banach spaces. To prove strong convergence of iterates in the extragradient method, we introduce a \phi-Lipschitz-type condition and assume that the equilibrium bifunction satisfies in this condition. This condition is unnecessary when the linesearch method is used instead of the extragradient method. A numerical example is given to illustrate the usability of our results. Our results generalize, extend and enrich some existing results in the literature.
