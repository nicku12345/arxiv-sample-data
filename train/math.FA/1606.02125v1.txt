Classical results due to Ingham and Paley-Wiener characterize the existence of nonzero functions supported on certain subsets of the real line in terms of the pointwise decay of the Fourier transforms. Viewing these results as uncertainty principles for Fourier transforms, we prove certain analogues of these results on connected, noncompact, semisimple Lie groups with finite center. We also use these results to show unique continuation property of solutions to the initial value problem for time-dependent Schr\"odinger equations on Riemmanian symmetric spaces of noncompact type.
