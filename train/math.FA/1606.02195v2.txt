We solve a class of isoperimetric problems on \mathbb{R}^N  with respect to weights that are powers of the distance to the origin. For instance we show that if k\in [0,1], then among all smooth sets \Omega in \mathbb{R} ^N with fixed Lebesgue measure, \int_{\partial \Omega } |x|^k \, \mathscr{H}_{N-1} (dx) achieves its minimum for a ball centered at the origin. Our results also imply a weighted Polya-Sz\"ego principle. In turn, we establish radiality of optimizers in some Caffarelli-Kohn-Nirenberg inequalities, and we obtain sharp bounds for eigenvalues of some nonlinear problems.
