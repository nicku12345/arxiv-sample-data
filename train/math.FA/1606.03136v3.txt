We review some of the recent developments and prove new results concerning frames and Bessel systems generated by iterations of the form \{A^ng: g\in G,\, n=0,1,2,\dots \}, where A is a bounded linear operators on a separable complex Hilbert space  \mathcal{H}  and G is a countable set of vectors in  \mathcal{H} . The system of iterations mentioned above was motivated from the so called dynamical sampling problem. In dynamical sampling, an unknown function f and its future states A^nf are coarsely sampled at each time level n, 0\leq n< L, where A is an evolution operator that drives the system. The goal is to recover f from these space-time samples.
