Let (\Omega,\Sigma,\mu) be a \sigma-finite complete measure space, \tau:\Omega\rightarrow\Omega be a measurable transformation and \phi be an Orlicz function. In this article, first a necessary and sufficient condition for the bounded multiplication operator M_u on Orlicz space L^\phi (\Omega) induced by measurable function u to be completely continuous has been established. Next by using Radon-Nikodym derivative \omega = \frac{d \mu\circ \tau^{-1}}{d \mu}, the multiplication operator M_u on weighted Orlicz space L^{\phi}_\omega(\Omega) have been characterized.
