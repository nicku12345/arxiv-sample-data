Let \ast_P be a product on l_{\rm{fin}} (a space of all finite sequences) associated with a fixed family (P_n)_{n=0}^{\infty} of real polynomials on \mathbb{R}. In this article, using methods from the theory of generalized eigenvector expansion, we investigate moment-type properties of \ast_P-positive functionals on l_{\rm{fin}}. If (P_n)_{n=0}^{\infty} is a family of the Newton polynomials P_n(x)=\prod_{i=0}^{n-1}(x-i) then the corresponding product \star=\ast_P is an analog of the so-called Kondratiev--Kuna convolution on a "Fock space". We get an explicit expression for the product \star and establish a connection between \star-positive functionals on l_{\rm{fin}} and a one-dimensional analog of the Bogoliubov generating functionals (the classical Bogoliubov functionals are defined correlation functions for statistical mechanics systems).
