We give several structural results concerning the Lipschitz-free spaces \mathcal F(M), where M is a metric space. We show that \mathcal F(M) contains a complemented copy of \ell_1(\Gamma), where \Gamma=\text{dens}(M). If \mathcal N is the net in a finite dimensional Banach space X, we show that \mathcal F(\mathcal N) is isomorphic to its square. If X contains a complemented copy of \ell_p, c_0 then \mathcal F(\mathcal N) is isomorphic to its \ell_1-sum. Finally, we prove that for all X\cong C(K) spaces \mathcal F(\mathcal N) are mutually isomorphic spaces with a Schauder basis.
