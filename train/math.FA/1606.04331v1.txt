We study L^2-maximal regularity for non-autonomous evolution equations of the form \begin{equation}\label{Abstract equation} \dot u(t)+\mathcal A(t)u(t)=f(t)\ \ t\in[0,T],\ \ u(0)=u_0. \end{equation} where \mathcal A(t),\ t\in [0,T] arise from a non-autonomous sesquilinear forms a(t,\cdot,\cdot) on a Hilbert space H with constant domain V\subset H. L^2-maximal regularity result is proved recently in \cite{Ar-Mo15} when a is H\"older continuous of type \alpha>1/2. In this paper we recover the same results by an approximation method developed in \cite{ELLA13}, \cite{LASA14} and \cite{ELLA15}. The method uses an appropriate approximation \mathcal A_\Lambda(\cdot) of \mathcal A(\cdot) for which \begin{equation}\label{Abstract equation approx} \dot u_{\Lambda}(t)+\mathcal A_{\Lambda}(t)u_{\Lambda}(t)=f(t)\ \ t\in[0,T],\ \ u_{\Lambda}(0)=u_0 \end{equation} has L^2-maximal regularity where \Lambda is a subdivision of [0,T]. Moreover, under a little more assumptions on the modulus of continuity we show that the solutions of (\ref{Abstract equation approx}) converges in L^2(0,T,V)\cap H^1(0,T,H)\cap C(0,T,V) uniformly on the initial datas (u_0,f) to the solution of (\ref{Abstract equation}) as |\Lambda| \rightarrow 0.
