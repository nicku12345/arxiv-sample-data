This article gives an affirmative solution to the problem whether the ergodic Ces\'aro averages generated by a positive Dunford-Schwartz operator in a noncommutative space L^p(\mathcal M,\tau), 1\leq p<\infty, converge almost uniformly (in Egorov's sense). This problem goes back to the original paper of Yeadon, published in 1977, where bilaterally almost uniform convergence of these averages was established for p=1.
