Let X be a completely regular space. For a non-vanishing self-adjoint Banach subalgebra H of C_B(X) which has local units we construct the spectrum \mathfrak{sp}(H) of H as an open subspace of the Stone-Cech compactification of X which contains X as a dense subspace. The construction of \mathfrak{sp}(H) is simple. This enables us to study certain properties of \mathfrak{sp}(H), among them are various compactness and connectedness properties. In particular, we find necessary and sufficient conditions in terms of either H or X under which \mathfrak{sp}(H) is connected, locally connected and pseudocompact, strongly zero-dimensional, basically disconnected, extremally disconnected, or an F-space.
