We consider conditions on a given system \mathcal{F} of vectors in Hilbert space \mathcal{H}, forming a frame, which turn \mathcal{H} into a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. It is assumed that the vectors in \mathcal{F} are functions on some set \Omega. We then identify conditions on these functions which automatically give \mathcal{H} the structure of a reproducing kernel Hilbert space of functions on \Omega. We further give an explicit formula for the kernel, and for the corresponding isometric isomorphism. Applications are given to Hilbert spaces associated to families of Gaussian processes.
