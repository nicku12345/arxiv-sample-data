In this paper we consider a new kind of inequality related to fractional integration, motivated by Gressman's paper. Based on it we investigate its multilinear analogue inequalities. Combining with the Gressman's work on multilinear integral, we establish this new kind of geometric inequalities with bilinear form and multilinear form in more general settings. Moreover, in some cases we also find the best constants and optimisers for these geometric inequalities on Euclidean spaces with Lebesgue measure settings with L^p bounds.
