In a recent article, Khojasteh et al. introduced a new class of simulation functions, Z-contractions, with blending over known contractive conditions in the literature. Subsequently, in this paper, we extend and generalize the results on \theta-metric context and we discuss some fixed point results in connection with existing ones. Also, we originate the notion of modified Z-contractions and explore the existence and uniqueness of fixed points of such functions on the said spaces. Finally we include examples to instantiate our main results.
