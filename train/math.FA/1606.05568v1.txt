Let \mathbf D=\bar{\mathbb D} be the closed unit disk in \mathbb C and \mathbf B_n=\bar{\mathbb B_n} the closed unit ball in \mathbb C^n. For a compact subset K in \mathbb C^n with nonempty interior, let A(K) be the uniform algebra of all complex-valued continuous functions on K that are holomorphic in the interior of K. We give short and non-technical proofs of the known facts that A(\bar{\mathbb D}^n) and A(\mathbf B_n) are noncoherent rings. Using, additionally, Earl's interpolation theorem in the unit disk and the existence of peak-functions, we also establish with the same method the new result that A(K) is not coherent.   As special cases we obtain Hickel's theorems on the noncoherence of A(\bar\Omega), where \Omega runs through a certain class of pseudoconvex domains in \mathbb C^n, results that were obtained with deep and complicated methods. Finally, using a refinement of the interpolation theorem we show that no uniformly closed subalgebra A of C(K) with P(K)\subseteq A\subseteq C(K) is coherent provided the polynomial convex hull of K has no isolated points.
