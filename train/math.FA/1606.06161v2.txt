Let H and K be two complex Hilbert spaces and B(H) be the algebra of bounded linear operators from H into itself. The main purpose in this paper is to obtain a characterization of bijective maps \Phi : B(H) \rightarrow B(K) satisfying the following condition \Delta \lambda (\Phi(A) \bullet \Phi(B)) = \Phi(\Delta \lambda (A \bullet B)) for all A, B \in B(H), where \Delta \lambda (T) stands the \lambda-Aluthge transform of the operator T \in B(H) and A \bullet B = 1 2 (AB + BA) is the Jordan product of A and B. We prove that a bijective map \Phi satisfies the above condition, if and only if there exists an unitary operator U : H \rightarrow K, such that \Phi has the form \Phi(A) = UAU * for all A \in B(H).
