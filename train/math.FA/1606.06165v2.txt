Let H and K be two Hilbert spaces and B(H) be the algebra of all bounded linear operators from H into itself. The main purpose of this paper is to obtain a characterization of bijective maps \Phi : B(H) \rightarrow B(K) satisfying the following condition \Delta \lambda (\Phi(A)\Phi(B)) = \Phi(\Delta \lambda (AB)) f orall A, B \in B(H), where \Delta \lambda (T) stands the \lambda-Aluthge transform of the operator T \in B(H). More precisely, we prove that a bijective map \Phi satisfies the above condition, if and only , if \Phi(A) = U AU * for all A \in B(H), for some unitary operator U : H \rightarrow K.
