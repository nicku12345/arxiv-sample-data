In this paper embeddings between weighted complementary local Morrey-type spaces {\,^{^{\bf c}}\!}LM_{p\theta,\omega}({\mathbb R}^n,v) and weighted local Morrey-type spaces LM_{p\theta,\omega}({\mathbb R}^n,v) are characterized. In particular, two-sided estimates of the optimal constant c in the inequality   \begin{equation*}   \bigg( \int_0^{\infty} \bigg( \int_{B(0,t)} f(x)^{p_2}v_2(x)\,dx \bigg)^{\frac{q_2}{p_2}} u_2(t)\,dt\bigg)^{\frac{1}{q_2}} \le c \bigg( \int_0^{\infty} \bigg( \int_{{\,^{^{\bf c}}\!}B(0,t)} f(x)^{p_1} v_1(x)\,dx\bigg)^{\frac{q_1}{p_1}} u_1(t)\,dt\bigg)^{\frac{1}{q_1}}   \end{equation*} are obtained, where p_1,\,p_2,\,q_1,\,q_2 \in (0,\infty), p_2 \le q_2 and u_1,\,u_2 and v_1,\,v_2 are weights on (0,\infty) and {\mathbb R}^n, respectively. The proof is based on the combination of duality techniques with estimates of optimal constants of the embeddings between weighted local Morrey-type and complementary local Morrey-type spaces and weighted Lebesgue spaces, which reduce the problem to the solutions of the iterated Hardy-type inequalities.
