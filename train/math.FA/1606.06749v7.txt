Let S \subset \mathbb{R}^{n} be a~closed set such that for some d \in [0,n] and \varepsilon > 0 the~d-Hausdorff content \mathcal{H}^{d}_{\infty}(S \cap Q(x,r)) \geq \varepsilon r^{d} for all cubes~Q(x,r) centered in~x \in S with side length 2r \in (0,2]. For every p \in (1,\infty), denote by W_{p}^{1}(\mathbb{R}^{n}) the classical Sobolev space on \mathbb{R}^{n}. We give an~intrinsic characterization of the restriction W_{p}^{1}(\mathbb{R}^{n})|_{S} of the space W_{p}^{1}(\mathbb{R}^{n}) to~the set S provided that p > \max\{1,n-d\}. Furthermore, we prove the existence of a bounded linear operator \operatorname{Ext}:W_{p}^{1}(\mathbb{R}^{n})|_{S} \to W_{p}^{1}(\mathbb{R}^{n}) such that \operatorname{Ext} is right inverse for the usual trace operator. In particular, for p > n-1 we characterize the trace space of the Sobolev space W_{p}^{1}(\mathbb{R}^{n}) to the closure \overline{\Omega} of an arbitrary open path-connected set~\Omega. Our results extend those available for p \in (1,n] with much more stringent restrictions on~S.
