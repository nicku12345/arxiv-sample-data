The main goal of this article is to find the exact difference between a convex function and its secant, as a limit of positive quantities. This idea will be expressed as a convex inequality that leads to refinements and reversals of well established inequalities treating different means. The significance of these inequalities is to write one inequality that brings together and refine almost all known inequalities treating the arithmetic, geometric, harmonic and Heinz means, for numbers and operators.
