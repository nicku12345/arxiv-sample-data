In this article, we prove several multi-term refinements of Young type inequalities for both real numbers and operators improving several known results. Among other results, we prove \begin{eqnarray*} A\#_{\nu}B&+&\sum_{j=1}^{N}s_{j}(\nu)\left(A\#_{\alpha_j(\nu)}B+A\#_{2^{1-j}+\alpha_j(\nu)}B-2A\#_{2^{-j}+\alpha_j(\nu)}B\right)\leq A\nabla_{\nu}B, \end{eqnarray*} for the positive operators A and B, where 0\leq \nu\leq 1, N\in\mathbb{N} and \alpha_j(\nu) is a certain function. Moreover, some new Heinz type inequalities involving the Hilbert-Schmidt norm are established.
