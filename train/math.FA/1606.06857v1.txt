Let A and B be Banach algebras, \theta: A\to B be a continuous Banach algebra homomorphism and I be a closed ideal in B. Then the direct sum of A and I with respect to \theta, denoted A\bowtie^{\theta}I, with a special product becomes a Banach algebra which is called the amalgamated Banach algebra. In this paper, among other things, we compute the topological centre of A\bowtie^{\theta}I in terms of that of A and I. Using this, we provide a characterization of the Arens regularity of A\bowtie^{\theta}I. Then we determine the character space of A\bowtie^{\theta}I in terms of that of A and I. Moreover, we study the weak amenability of A\bowtie^{\theta}I.
