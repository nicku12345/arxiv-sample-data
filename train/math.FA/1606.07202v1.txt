Let X, Y, and Z be Banach spaces, and let \alpha be a tensor norm. Let a bounded linear operator S\in\mathcal{L}(Z,\mathcal{L}(X,Y)) be given. We obtain (necessary and/or sufficient) conditions for the existence of an operator U\in\mathcal{L}(Z\hat{\otimes}_{\alpha}X,Y) such that (Sz)x = U(z\otimes x), for all z\in Z and x\in X, i.e., S= U^{#}, the associated operator to U. Let \Omega be a compact Hausdorff space and denote by \mathcal{C}(\Omega) the space of continuous functions from \Omega into \mathbb{K}. We apply these results to S\in\mathcal{L}(\mathcal{C}(\Omega),\mathcal{L}(X, Y)) for characterizing the existence of an operator U\in\mathcal{L}(\mathcal{C}_{p}(\Omega,X),Y) such that U^{#}=S, where \mathcal{C}_{p}(\Omega,X) is the space of p-continuous X-valued functions, 1\leq p \leq \infty.
