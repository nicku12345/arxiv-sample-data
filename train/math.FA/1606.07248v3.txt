We give an algorithm for finding a solution to the Carath\'{e}odory-Fej\'{e}r interpolation problem on the polydisc \mathbb D^n, whenever it exists. A necessary condition for the existence of a solution becomes apparent from this algorithm. A generalization of the well-known theorem due to Nehari has been obtained. A proof of the Kor\'{a}nyi--Puk\'{a}nszky theorem is given using the spectral theorem.
