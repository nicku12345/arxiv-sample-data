We consider separately radial (with corresponding group \mathbb{T}^n) and radial (with corresponding group \mathrm{U}(n)) symbols on the projective space \mathbb{P}^n(\mathbb{C}), as well as the associated Toeplitz operators on the weighted Bergman spaces. It is known that the C^*-algebras generated by each family of such Toeplitz operators are commutative. We present a new representation theoretic proof of such commutativity. Our method is easier and more enlightening as it shows that the commutativity of the C^*-algebras is a consequence of the existence of multiplicity-free representations. Furthermore, our method shows how to extend the current formulas for the spectra of the corresponding Toeplitz operators to any closed group lying between \mathbb{T}^n and \mathrm{U}(n).
