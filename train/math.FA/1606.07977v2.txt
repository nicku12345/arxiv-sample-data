In this paper, we consider a condition on subspaces in order to improve bounds given in the Bernstein's Lethargy Theorem (BLT) for Banach spaces. Let d_1 \geq d_2 \geq \dots d_n \geq \dots > 0 be an infinite sequence of numbers converging to 0, and let Y_1 \subset Y_2 \subset \dots\subset Y_n \subset \dots \subset X be a sequence of closed nested subspaces in a Banach space X with the property that \overline{Y}_{n}\subset Y_{n+1} for all n\ge1. We prove that for any c \in (0,1], there exists an element x_c \in X such that  c d_n \leq \rho(x_c, Y_n) \leq \min (4, \tilde{a}) c\, d_n.  Here, \rho(x, Y_n)= \inf \{ ||x-y||: \,\,y\in Y_n\}, \tilde{a} =\sup_{i\ge1}\sup_{\left \{ q_{i} \right \}}\left \{ a_{n_{i+1}-1}^{-3}\right \} where the sequence \{a_n\} is defined as: for all  n \geq 1 ,  a_n = \inf_{l \geq n} \, \inf_{q \in \langle q_l, q_{l+1},\dots \rangle} \frac{\rho(q,Y_l)}{||q||}  in which each point q_n is taken from Y_{n+1} \setminus Y_{n}, and satisfies \inf\limits_{n\ge1} a_n > 0. The sequence \{n_i\}_{i\ge1} is given by %Theorem \ref{100}, \{n_i\} satisfying (\ref{ni}) and n_{i}\leq n<n_{i+1}.  n_1=1;~n_{i+1}= \min \left \{ n\ge1 : \frac{d_n}{{a_{n}^{2}}} \leq d_{n_{i}}\right \},~i\geq 1.
