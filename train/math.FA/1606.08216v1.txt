In this paper, the Pazy's Fixed Point Theorems of monotone \alpha-nonexpansive mapping T are proved in a uniformly convex Banach space E with the partial order "\leq". That is, we obtain that the fixed point set of T with respect to the partial order "\leq" is nonempty whenever the Picard iteration \{T^nx_0\} is bounded for some initial point x_0 with x_0\leq Tx_0 or Tx_0\leq x_0. When restricting the demain of T to the cone P, a monotone \alpha-nonexpansive mapping T has at least a fixed point if and only if the Picard iteration \{T^n0\} is bounbed. Furthermore, with the help of the properties of the normal cone P, the weakly and strongly convergent theorems of the Picard iteration \{T^nx_0\} are showed for finding a fixed point of T with respect to the partial order "\leq" in uniformly convex ordered Banach space.
