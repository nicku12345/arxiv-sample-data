We investigate the notions of amenability and its related homological notions for a class of I\times I-upper triangular matrix algebra, say UP(I,A), where A is a Banach algebra equipped with a non-zero character. We show that UP(I,A) is pseudo-contractible (amenable) if and only if I is singleton and A is pseudo-contractible (amenable), respectively. We also study the notions of pseudo-amenability and approximate biprojectivity of UP(I,A).
