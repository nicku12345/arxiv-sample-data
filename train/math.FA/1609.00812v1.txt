The Cesaro operator \mathsf{C}, when acting in the classical growth Banach spaces A^{-\gamma} and A_0^{-\gamma}, for \gamma > 0 , of analytic functions on \mathbb{D}, is investigated. Based on a detailed knowledge of their spectra (due to A. Aleman and A.-M. Persson) we are able to determine the norms of these operators precisely. It is then possible to characterize the mean ergodic and related properties of \mathsf{C} acting in these spaces. In addition, we determine the largest Banach space of analytic functions on \mathbb{D} which \mathsf{C} maps into A^{-\gamma} (resp. into A_0^{-\gamma}); this optimal domain space always contains A^{-\gamma} (resp. A_0^{-\gamma}) as a proper subspace.
