In this paper, firstly, some applications of Hilbert matrix in image processing and cryptology are mentioned and an algorithm related to the Hilbert view of a digital image is given. In section 2, the new matrix domains are constructed and some properties are investigated. Furthermore, dual spaces of new matrix domains are computed and matrix transformations are characterized. In last section, examples of transformations of new spaces are given.
