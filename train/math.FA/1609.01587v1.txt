Modifying the moduli of supporting convexity and supporting smoothness, we introduce new moduli for Banach spaces which occur, e.g., as lengths of catheti of right-angled triangles (defined via so-called quasi-orthogonality). These triangles have two boundary points of the unit ball of a Banach space as endpoints of their hypotenuse, and their third vertex lies in a supporting hyperplane of one of the two other vertices. Among other things it is our goal to quantify via such triangles the local deviation of the unit sphere from its supporting hyperplanes. We prove respective Day-Nordlander type results, involving generalizations of the modulus of convexity and the modulus of Bana\'{s}.
