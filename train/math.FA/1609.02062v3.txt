We continue the investigation of the behaviour of octahedral norms in tensor products of Banach spaces. Firstly, we will prove the existence of a Banach space Y such that the injective tensor products l_1\widehat{\otimes}_\varepsilon Y and L_1\widehat{\otimes}_\varepsilon Y both fail to have an octahedral norm, which solves two open problems from the literature. Secondly, we will show that in the presence of the metric approximation property octahedrality is preserved from a non-reflexive L-embedded Banach space taking projective tensor products with an arbitrary Banach space.
