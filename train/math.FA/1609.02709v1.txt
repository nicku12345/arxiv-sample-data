Consider a Banach space valued measurable function f and an operator u from the space where {f} takes values. If f  is Pettis integrable, a classical result due to J. Diestel shows that composing it with u gives a Bochner integrable function u \circ f whenever u is absolutely summing. In a previous work we have shown that a well-known interpolation technique for operator ideals allows to prove under some requirements that a composition of a p-Pettis integrable function with a q-summing operator provides an r-Bochner integrable function. In this paper a new abstract inclusion theorem for classes of {abstract} summing operators is shown and applied to the class of interpolated operator ideals. Together with the results of the {aforementioned} paper, it provides more results on the relation about the integrability of the function u \circ f and the summability properties of u.
