The Hardy--Littlewood inequality for m-linear forms on \ell _{p} spaces and m<p\leq 2m asserts that \begin{equation*} \left( \sum_{j_{1},...,j_{m}=1}^{\infty }\left\vert T\left( e_{j_{1}},\ldots ,e_{j_{m}}\right) \right\vert ^{\frac{p}{p-m}}\right) ^{\frac{p-m}{p}}\leq 2^{\frac{m-1}{2}}\left\Vert T\right\Vert \end{equation*} for all continuous m-linear forms T:\ell _{p}\times \cdots \times \ell _{p}\rightarrow \mathbb{R} or \mathbb{C}. The case m=2 recovers a classical inequality proved by Hardy and Littlewood in 1934. As a consequence of the results of the present paper we show that the same inequality is valid with 2^{\frac{m-1}{2}} replaced by 2^{\frac{\left( m-1\right) \left( p-m\right) }{p}}. In particular, for m<p\leq m+1 the optimal constants of the above inequality are uniformly bounded by 2.
