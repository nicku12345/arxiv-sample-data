We study bounded holomorphic functional calculus for nonsymmetric infinite dimensional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck operators {\mathscr L}. We prove that if -{\mathscr L} generates an analytic semigroup on L^{2}(\gamma_{\infty}), then {\mathscr L} has bounded holomorphic functional calculus on L^{r}(\gamma_{\infty}), 1<r<\infty, in any sector of angle \theta>\theta^{*}_{r}, where \gamma_{\infty} is the associated invariant measure and \theta^{*}_{r} the sectoriality angle of {\mathscr L} on L^{r}(\gamma_{\infty}). The angle \theta^{*}_{r} is optimal. In particular our result applies to any nondegenerate finite dimensional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck operator, with dimension-free estimates.
