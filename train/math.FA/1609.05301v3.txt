A net x_\alpha in a lattice-normed vector lattice (X,p,E) is unbounded p-convergent to x\in X if p(|x_\alpha-x|\wedge u)\xrightarrow{o} 0 for every u\in X_+. This convergence has been investigated recently for (X,p,E)=(X,\lvert\cdot \rvert,X) under the name of uo-convergence, for (X,p,E)=(X,\lVert\cdot\rVert,{\mathbb R}) under the name of un-convergence, and also for (X,p,{\mathbb R}^{X^*}), where p(x)[f]:=|f|(|x|), under the name uaw-convergence. In this paper we study general properties of the unbounded p-convergence.
