We introduce the notions of multi-suprema and multi-infima for vector spaces equipped with a collection of wedges, generalizing the notions of suprema and infima in ordered vector spaces. Multi-lattices are vector spaces closed under multi-suprema and multi-infima and are thus an abstraction of vector lattices. The Riesz decomposition property in the multi-wedged setting is also introduced, leading to Riesz-Kantorovich formulas for multi-suprema and multi-infima in certain spaces of operators.
