Probabilistic frames are a generalization of finite frames into the Wasserstein space of probability measures with finite second moment. We introduce new probabilistic definitions of duality, analysis, and synthesis and investigate their properties. In particular, we formulate a theory of transport duals for probabilistic frames and prove certain properties of this class. We also investigate paths of probabilistic frames, identifying conditions under which geodesic paths between two such measures are themselves probabilistic frames. In the discrete case, this is related to ranks of convex combinations of matrices, while, in the continuous case, this is related to the continuity of the optimal transport plan.
