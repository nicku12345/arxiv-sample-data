We derive new results on the characterization of Gelfand--Shilov spaces \mathcal{S}^\mu_\nu (\R^n), \mu,\nu >0, \mu+\nu \geq 1 by Gevrey estimates of the L^2 norms of iterates of (m,k) anisotropic globally elliptic Shubin (or \Gamma) type operators, (-\Delta)^{m/2} +| x |^k with m,k\in 2\N being a model operator, and on the decay of the Fourier coefficients in the related eigenfunction expansions. Similar results are obtained for the spaces \Sigma^\mu_\nu (\R^n), \mu,\nu >0, \mu+\nu > 1, cf. \eqref{GSdef}. In contrast to the symmetric case \mu = \nu and k=m (classical Shubin operators) we encounter resonance type phenomena involving the ratio \kappa:=\mu/\nu; namely we obtain a characterization of \mathcal{S}^\mu_\nu(\R^n) and \Sigma^\mu_\nu(\R^n) in the case \mu=kt/(k+m), \nu= mt/(k+m), t \geq 1, that is, when \kappa=k/m \in \Q.
