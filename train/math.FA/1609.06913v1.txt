Let W, X, Y and Z be Dedekind complete Riesz spaces. For A\in L^{r}(Y, Z) and B\in L^{r}(W, X) let M_{A,\,B} be the two-sided multiplication operator from L^{r}(X, Y) into L^r(W,\,Z) defined by M_{A,\,B}(T)=ATB. We show that for every 0\leq A_0\in L^{r}_{n}(Y, Z), |M_{A_0, B}|(T)=M_{A_0, |B|}(T) holds for all B\in L^{r}(W, X) and all T\in L^{r}_{n}(X, Y). Furthermore, if W, X, Y and Z are Dedekind complete Banach lattices such that X and Y have order continuous norms, then |M_{A,\, B}|=M_{|A|, \,|B|} for all  A\in L^{r}(Y, Z) and all B\in L^{r}(W, X). Our results generalize the related results of Synnatzschke and Wickstead, respectively.
