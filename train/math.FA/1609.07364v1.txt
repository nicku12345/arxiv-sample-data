The real and complex interpolation spaces for the classical Hardy spaces H^1 and H^\infty were determined in 1983 by P.W. Jones. Due to the analytic constraints the associated Marcinkiewicz decomposition gives rise to a delicate approximation problem for the L^ 1 metric. Specifically for  f \in H^p the size of  {\rm{inf}} \{ \| f - f_1 \| _1 \,:\, f_1 \in H^\infty ,\, \|f_1\|_\infty \le \lambda \} needs to be determined for any  \lambda>0 . In the present paper we develop a new set of truncation formulae for obtaining the Marcinkiewicz decomposition of (H^1, H^\infty) . We revisit the real and complex interpolation theory for Hardy spaces by examining our newly found formulae.
