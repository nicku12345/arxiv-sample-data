In this paper we explore the structure of certain generalized isometries of the special orthogonal group SO(n) which are transformations that leave any member of a large class of generalized distance measures invariant. This gives us a far-reaching generalization of the former structural result of T. Abe, S. Akiyama and O. Hatori concerning c-spectral isometries of the special orthogonal group.
