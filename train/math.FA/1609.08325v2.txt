Given a Hilbert space operator T, the level sets of function \Psi_T(z)=\|(T-z)^{-1}\|^{-1} determine the so-called pseudospectra of T. We set \Psi_T to be zero on the spectrum of T. After giving some elementary properties of \Psi_T (which, as it seems, were not noticed before), we apply them to the study of the approximation. We prove that for any operator T, there is a sequence \{T_n\} of finite matrices such that \Psi_{T_n}(z) tends to \Psi_{T}(z) uniformly on \C. In this proof, quasitriangular operators play a special role. This is merely an existence result, we do not give a concrete construction of this sequence of matrices.   One of our main points is to show how to use infinite-dimensional operator models in order to produce examples and counterexamples in the set of finite matrices of large order. In particular, we get a result, which means, in a sense, that the pseudospectrum of a nilpotent matrix can be anything one can imagine. We also study the norms of the multipliers in the context of Cowen--Douglas class operators. We use these results to show that, to the opposite to the function \Psi_{S}, the function \|\sqrt{S-z}\,\| for certain finite matrices S may oscillate arbitrarily fast even far away from the spectrum.
