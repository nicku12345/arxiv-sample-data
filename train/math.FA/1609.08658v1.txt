Let \{f_n:n\in\mathbb{N}\} be a J-frame for a Krein space {\textbf{\textit{K}}} and P_M be a J-orthogonal projection from {\textbf{\textit{K}}} onto a subspace M. In this article we find sufficient conditions under which \{P_M(f_n):n\in\mathbb{N}\} is a J-frame for P_M\textbf{\textit{K}} and \{(I-P_M)f_n\}_{n\in{\mathbb{N}}} is a J-frame for (I-P_M)\textbf{\textit{K}}. We also introduce J-frame sequence for a Krein space {\textbf{\textit{K}}} and study some properties of J-frame sequence analogues to Hilbert space frame theory.
