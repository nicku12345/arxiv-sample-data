In this article, we proved that, under weak and natural requirements, uncorrelated scattering (in particular WSSUS) channels can be modeled as stochastic integrals. Moreover, if we assume (not only uncorrelated but also) independent scattering, then the stochastic integral kernel is an additive stochastic process. This allows us to decompose an IS channel into a sum of independent channels; one deterministic, one with a Gaussian kernel, and two others described by the Levy measure of the additive process.
