Here we give a new approach to the Paley--Wiener theorem in a Mellin analysis setting which avoids the use of the Riemann surface of the logarithm and analytical branches and is based on new concepts of "polar-analytic function" in the Mellin setting and Mellin--Bernstein spaces. A notion of Hardy spaces in the Mellin setting is also given along with applications to exponential sampling formulas of optical physics.
