We study metrically projective and metrically free matricially normed spaces. We describe these spaces in terms of a special space \widehat M_n, the space of n\times n matrices, endowed with a special matrix-norm. We show that metrically free matricially normed spaces are matricial \ell_1-sums of some distinguished families of matricially normed spaces \widehat M_n, whereas metrically projective matricially normed spaces are complete direct summands of matricial \ell_1-sums of arbitrary families of the spaces \widehat M_n. At the end we specify the underlying normed space of \widehat M_n and show that the spaces \widehat M_n; n>1 do not belong to any of the classes L^p; p\in [1,\infty], introduced by Effros and Ruan. However, in a certain sense the behavior of \widehat M_n resembles that of L^1-spaces.
