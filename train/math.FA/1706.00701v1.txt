Inspired by Kalton and Wood's work on group algebras, we describe almost completely contractive algebra homomorphisms from Fourier algebras into Fourier-Stieltjes algebras (endowed with their canonical operator space structure). We also prove that two locally compact groups are isomorphic if and only if there exists an algebra isomorphism T between the associated Fourier algebras (resp. Fourier-Stieltjes algebras) with completely bounded norm \| T \|_{cb} < \sqrt {3/2} (resp.  \| T \|_{cb} < \sqrt {5}/2). We show similar results involving the norm distortion \| T \| \| T ^{-1} \| with universal but non-explicit bound. Our results subsume Walter's well-known structural theorems and also Lau's theorem on second conjugate of Fourier algebras.
