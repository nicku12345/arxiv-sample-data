We give a new characterization of the class {\bf N}^0_{\mathfrak M}[-1,1] of the operator-valued in the Hilbert space {\mathfrak M} Nevanlinna functions that admit representations as compressed resolvents (m-functions) of selfadjoint contractions. We consider the automorphism {\bf \Gamma}: M(\lambda){\mapsto}M_{{\bf \Gamma}}(\lambda):=\left((\lambda^2-1)M(\lambda)\right)^{-1} of the class {\bf N}^0_{\mathfrak M}[-1,1] and construct a realization of M_{{\bf \Gamma}}(\lambda) as a compressed resolvent. The unique fixed point of {\bf\Gamma} is the m-function of the block-operator Jacobi matrix related to the Chebyshev polynomials of the first kind. We study a transformation {\bf\widehat \Gamma}: {\mathcal M}(\lambda)\mapsto {\mathcal M}_{{\bf\widehat \Gamma}}(\lambda) :=-({\mathcal M}(\lambda)+\lambda I_{\mathfrak M})^{-1} that maps the set of all Nevanlinna operator-valued functions into its subset. The unique fixed point \mathcal M_0 of {\bf\widehat\Gamma} admits a realization as the compressed resolvent of the "free" discrete Schr\"{o}dinger operator {\bf\widehat J}_0 in the Hilbert space {\bf H}_0=\ell^2(\mathbb N_0)\bigotimes{\mathfrak M}. We prove that {\mathcal M}_0 is the uniform limit on compact sets of the open upper/lower half-plane in the operator norm topology of the iterations \{{\mathcal M}_{n+1}(\lambda)=-({\mathcal M}_n(\lambda)+\lambda I_\mathfrak M)^{-1}\} of {\bf\widehat\Gamma}. We show that the pair \{{\bf H}_0,{\bf \widehat J}_0\} is the inductive limit of the sequence of realizations \{\widehat{\mathfrak H}_n,\widehat A_n\} of \{{\mathcal M}_n\}. In the scalar case ({\mathfrak M}={\mathbb C}), applying the algorithm of I.S.~Kac, a realization of iterates \{{\mathcal M}_n\} as m-functions of canonical (Hamiltonian) systems is constructed.
