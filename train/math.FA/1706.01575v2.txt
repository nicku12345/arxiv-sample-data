Suppose X is a vector lattice and there is a notion of convergence x_{\alpha} \rightarrow x in X. Then we can speak of an "unbounded" version of this convergence by saying that (x_{\alpha}) unbounded converges to x\in X if \lvert x_\alpha-x\rvert \wedge u\rightarrow 0 for every u \in X_+. In the literature, the unbounded versions of the norm, order and absolute weak convergence have been studied. Here we create a general theory of unbounded convergence but with a focus on uo-convergence and those convergences deriving from locally solid topologies.
