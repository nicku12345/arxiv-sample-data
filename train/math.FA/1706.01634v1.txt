In this paper, we prove some random fixed point theorems for Hardy-Rogers self-random operators in separable Banach spaces and, as some applications, we show the existence of a solution for random nonlinear integral equations in Banach spaces. Some stochastic versions of deterministic fixed point theorems for Hardy-Rogers self mappings and stochastic integral equations are obtained.
