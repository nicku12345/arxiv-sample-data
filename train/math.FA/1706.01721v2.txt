We give a simple alternative proof for the C^{1,1}--convex extension problem which has been introduced and studied by D. Azagra and C. Mudarra [2]. As an application, we obtain an easy constructive proof for the Glaeser-Whitney problem of C^{1,1} extensions on a Hilbert space. In both cases we provide explicit formulae for the extensions. For the Gleaser-Whitney problem the obtained extension is almost minimal, that is, minimal up to a factor \frac{1+\sqrt{3}}{2} in the sense of Le Gruyer [15].
