We consider dissipative operators A of the form A=S+iV, where both S and V\geq 0 are assumed to be symmetric but neither of them needs to be (essentially) selfadjoint. After a brief discussion of the relation of the operators S\pm iV to dual pairs with the so called common core property, we present a necessary and suffcient condition for any extension of A with domain contained in \mathcal{D}((S-iV)^*) to be dissipative. We will discuss several special situations in which this condition can be expressed in a particularly nice form -- accessible to direct computations. Examples involving ordinary differential operators are given.
