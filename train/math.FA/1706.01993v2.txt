All unitary perturbations of a given unitary operator U by finite rank d operators with fixed range can be parametrized by (d\times d) unitary matrices \Gamma; this generalizes unitary rank one (d=1) perturbations, where the Aleksandrov--Clark family of unitary perturbations is parametrized by the scalars on the unit circle \mathbb{T}\subset\mathbb{C}.   For a purely contractive \Gamma the resulting perturbed operator T_\Gamma is a contraction (a completely non-unitary contraction under the natural assumption about cyclicity of the range), so they admit the functional model.   In this paper we investigate the Clark operator, i.e. a unitary operator that intertwines T_\Gamma (presented in the spectral representation of the non-perturbed operator U) and its model. We make no assumptions on the spectral type of the unitary operator U; absolutely continuous spectrum may be present.   We find a representation of the adjoint Clark operator in the coordinate free Nikolski--Vasyunin functional model. This representation features a special version of the vector-valued Cauchy integral operator. Regularization of this singular integral operator yield representations of the adjoint Clark operator in the Sz.-Nagy--Foias transcription. In the special case of inner characteristic functions (purely singular spectral measure of U) this representation gives what can be considered as a natural generalization of the normalized Cauchy transform (which is a prominent object in the Clark theory for rank one case) to the vector-valued settings.
