Let x_\alpha be a net in a locally solid vector lattice (X,\tau); we say that x_\alpha is unbounded \tau-convergent to a vector x\in X if \lvert x_\alpha-x \rvert\wedge w \xrightarrow{\tau} 0 for all w\in X_+. In this paper, we study general properties of unbounded \tau-convergence (shortly, u\tau-convergence). u\tau-Convergence generalizes unbounded norm convergence and unbounded absolute weak convergence in normed lattices that have been investigated recently. Besides, we introduce u\tau-topology and study briefly metrizabililty and completeness of this topology.
