We characterize the Garsia-Rodemich spaces associated with a rearrangement invariant space via local maximal operators. Let Q_{0} be a cube in R^{n}. We show that there exists s_{0}\in(0,1), such that for all 0<s<s_{0}, and for all r.i. spaces X(Q_{0}), we have% \[ GaRo_{X}(Q_{0})=\{f\in L^{1}(Q_{0}):\Vert f\Vert_{GaRo_{X}}\simeq\Vert M_{0,s,Q_{0}}^{\#}f\Vert_{X}<\infty\}, \] where M_{0,s,Q_{0}}^{\#} is the Str\"{o}mberg-Jawerth-Torchinsky local maximal operator. Combined with a formula for the K-functional of the pair (L^{1},BMO) obtained by Jawerth-Torchinsky, our result shows that the GaRo_{X} spaces are interpolation spaces between L^{1} and BMO. Among the applications, we prove, using real interpolation, the monotonicity under rearrangements of Garsia-Rodemich type functionals. We also give an approach to Sobolev-Morrey inequalities via Garsia-Rodemich norms, and prove necessary and sufficient conditions for GaRo_{X}(Q_{0})=X(Q_{0}). Using packings, we obtain a new expression for the K-functional of the pair (L^{1},BMO).
