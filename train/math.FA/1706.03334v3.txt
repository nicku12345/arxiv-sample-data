The main purpose of this article is to study estimates for the Tsallis relative operator entropy, by the use of Hermite-Hadamard inequality. Thus, we obtain alternative bounds for the Tsallis relative operator entropy. In the process to derive these bounds, we established the significant relation between the Tsallis relative operator entropy and the generalized relative operator entropy. In addition, we study the properties on monotonicity for the weight of operator means, and for the parameter of relative operator entropies.
