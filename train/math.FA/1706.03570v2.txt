We give examples of composition operators C\_\Phi on H^2 (\D^2) showing that the condition \|\Phi \|\_\infty = 1 is not sufficient for their approximation numbers a\_n (C\_\Phi) to satisfy \lim\_{n \to \infty} [a\_n (C\_\Phi) ]^{1/\sqrt{n}} = 1, contrary to the 1-dimensional case. We also give a situation where this implication holds. We make a link with the Monge-Amp\`ere capacity of the image of \Phi.
