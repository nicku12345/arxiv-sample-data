We study several notions of boundedness for operators. It is known that any power bounded operator is absolutely Ces\`aro bounded and strong Kreiss bounded (in particular, uniformly Kreiss bounded). The converses do not hold in general. In this note, we give examples of topologically mixing absolutely Ces\`aro bounded operators on \ell^p(\mathbb{N}), 1\le p < \infty, which are not power bounded, and provide examples of uniformly Kreiss bounded operators which are not absolutely Ces\`aro bounded. These results complement very limited number of known examples (see \cite{Shi} and \cite{AS}). In \cite{AS} Aleman and Suciu ask if every uniformly Kreiss bounded operator T on a Banach spaces satisfies that \lim_n\| \frac{T^n}{n}\|=0. We solve this question for Hilbert space operators and, moreover, we prove that, if T is absolutely Ces\`aro bounded on a Banach (Hilbert) space, then \| T^n\|=o(n) (\| T^n\|=o(n^{\frac{1}{2}}), respectively). As a consequence, every absolutely Ces\`aro bounded operator on a reflexive Banach space is mean ergodic, and there exist mixing mean ergodic operators on \ell^p(\mathbb{N}), 1< p <\infty. Finally, we give new examples of weakly ergodic 3-isometries and study numerically hypercyclic m-isometries on finite or infinite dimensional Hilbert spaces. In particular, all weakly ergodic strict 3-isometries on a Hilbert space are weakly numerically hypercyclic. Adjoints of unilateral forward weighted shifts which are strict m-isometries on \ell ^2(\mathbb{N}) are shown to be hypercyclic.
