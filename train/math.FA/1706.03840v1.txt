We study horospherical Radon transforms that integrate functions on the n-dimensional real hyperbolic space over horospheres of arbitrary fixed dimension 1\le d\le n-1. Exact existence conditions and new explicit inversion formulas are obtained for these transforms acting on smooth functions and functions belonging to L^p. The case d=n-1 agrees with the well-known Gelfand-Graev transform.
