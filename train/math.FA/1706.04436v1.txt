Let A be a Banach algebra and X be a compact Hausdorff space. Given homomorphisms  \sigma \in Hom(A) and \tau \in Hom(C(X, A)), we introduce induced homomorphisms \tilde{\sigma}\in Hom(C(X, A))  and \tilde{\tau}\in Hom(A), respectively. We study when \tau-(weak) amenability of C(X, A) implies \tilde{\tau}-(weak) amenability of A. We also investigate where  \sigma-weak amenability of A yields \tilde{\sigma}-weak amenability of C(X, A).
