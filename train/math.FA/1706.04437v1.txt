Given a Banach algebra  \mathcal{A}  and a continuous homomorphism \sigma on it, the notion of \sigma-biflatness for  \mathcal{A}  is introduced. This is a generalization of biflatness and it is shown that they are distinct. The relations between \sigma-biflatness and some other close concepts such as \sigma-biprojectivity and \sigma-amenability are studied. The \sigma-biflatness of tensor product of Banach algebras are also discussed.
