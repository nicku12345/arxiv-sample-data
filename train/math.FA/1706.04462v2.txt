In this paper, we study the smoothness of restrictions of Besov functions. It is known that for any f\in B\_{p,q}^s(\mathbb{R}^N) with q\leq p we have f(\cdot,y)\in B\_{p,q}^s(\mathbb{R}^d) for a.e. y\in \mathbb{R}^{N-d}. We prove that this is no longer true when p\<q. Namely, we construct a function f\in B\_{p,q}^s(\mathbb{R}^N) such that f(\cdot,y)\notin B\_{p,q}^s(\mathbb{R}^d) for a.e. y\in \mathbb{R}^{N-d}. We show that, in fact, f(\cdot,y) belong to B\_{p,q}^{(s,\Psi)}(\mathbb{R}^d) for a.e. y\in\mathbb{R}^{N-d}, a Besov space of generalized smoothness, and, when q=\infty, we find the optimal condition on the function \Psi for this to hold. The natural generalization of these results to Besov spaces of generalized smoothness is also investigated.
