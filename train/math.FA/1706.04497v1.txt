In this paper, we establish some upper bounds for numerical radius inequalities including of 2\times 2 operator matrices and their off-diagonal parts. Among other inequalities, it is shown that if T=\left[\begin{array}{cc}   0&X,   Y&0   \end{array}\right], then   \begin{align*}   \omega^{r}(T)\leq 2^{r-2}\left\|f^{2r}(|X|)+g^{2r}(|Y^*|)\right\|^\frac{1}{2}\left\|f^{2r}(|Y|)+g^{2r}(|X^*|)\right\|^\frac{1}{2}   \end{align*} and   \begin{align*}   \omega^{r}(T)\leq 2^{r-2}\left\|f^{2r}(|X|)+f^{2r}(|Y^*|)\right\|^\frac{1}{2}\left\|g^{2r}(|Y|)+g^{2r}(|X^*|)\right\|^\frac{1}{2},   \end{align*} where X, Y are bounded linear operators on a Hilbert space {\mathscr H}, r\geq 1 and f, g are nonnegative continuous functions on [0, \infty) satisfying the relation f(t)g(t)=t\,(t\in[0, \infty)). Moreover, we present some inequalities involving the generalized Euclidean operator radius of operators T_{1},\cdots,T_{n}.
