Let H_m(\mathbb B,\mathcal D) be the \mathcal D-valued functional Hilbert space with reproducing kernel K_m(z,w) = (1-\langle z,w\rangle)^{-m}1_{\mathcal D}. A K_m-inner function is by definition an operator-valued analytic function W: \mathbb B \rightarrow L(\mathcal E, \mathcal D) such that \|Wx\|_{H_m(\mathbb B,\mathcal D)} = \|x\| for all x \in \mathcal E and (W\mathcal E) \perp M_z^{\alpha}(W\mathcal E) for all \alpha \in \mathbb N^n \setminus \{0\}. We show that the K_m-inner functions are precisely the functions of the form W(z) = D + C \sum^m_{k=1}(1 - ZT^*)^{-k}ZB, where T \in L(H)^n is a pure m-hypercontraction and the operators T^*, B, C,D form a 2 \times 2-operator matrix satisfying suitable conditions. Thus we extend results proved by Olofsson on the unit disc to the case of the unit ball \mathbb B \subset \mathbb C^n.
