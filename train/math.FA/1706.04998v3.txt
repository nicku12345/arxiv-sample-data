We construct a self-similar local regular Dirichlet form on the Sierpi\'nski gasket using \Gamma-convergence of stable-like non-local closed forms. As a continuation of a recent paper by Grigor'yan and the author, we give the first \emph{unified} purely analytic construction of local regular Dirichlet forms that works both on the Sierpi\'nski gasket and the Sierpi\'nski carpet.
