We characterize operators T=PQ (P,Q orthogonal projections in a Hilbert space H) which have a singular value decomposition. A spatial characterizations is given: this condition occurs if and only if there exist orthonormal bases \{\psi_n\} of R(P) and \{\xi_n\} of R(Q) such that \langle\xi_n,\psi_m\rangle=0 if n\ne m. Also it is shown that this is equivalent to A=P-Q being diagonalizable. Several examples are studied, relating Toeplitz, Hankel and Wiener-Hopf operators to this condition. We also examine the relationship with the differential geometry of the Grassmann manifold of underlying the Hilbert space: if T=PQ has a singular value decomposition, then the generic parts of P and Q are joined by a minimal geodesic with diagonalizable exponent.
