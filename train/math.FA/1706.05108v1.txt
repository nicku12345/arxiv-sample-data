In this paper, we obtain Hardy, Hardy-Rellich and refined Hardy inequalities on general stratified groups and weighted Hardy inequalities on general homogeneous groups using the factorization method of differential operators, inspired by the recent work of Gesztesy and Littlejohn \cite{GL17}. We note that some of the obtained inequalities are new also in the usual Euclidean setting. We also obtain analogues of Gesztesy and Littlejohn's 2-parameter version of the Rellich inequality on stratified groups and on the Heisenberg group, and a new two-parameter estimate on \mathbb{R}^{n} which can be regarded as a counterpart to the Gesztesy and Littlejohn's estimate.
