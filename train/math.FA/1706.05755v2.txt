Let \mathcal{M}=\{m_\lambda\}_{\lambda\in\Lambda} be a separating family of lattice seminorms on a vector lattice X, then (X,\mathcal{M}) is called a multi-normed vector lattice (or MNVL). We write x_\alpha \xrightarrow{\mathrm{m}} x if m_\lambda(x_\alpha-x)\to 0 for all \lambda\in\Lambda. A net x_\alpha in an MNVL X=(X,\mathcal{M}) is said to be unbounded m-convergent (or um-convergent) to x if \lvert x_\alpha-x \rvert\wedge u \xrightarrow{\mathrm{m}} 0 for all u\in X_+. um-Convergence generalizes un-convergence \cite{DOT,KMT} and uaw-convergence \cite{Zab}, and specializes up-convergence \cite{AEEM1} and u\tau-convergence \cite{DEM2}. um-Convergence is always topological, whose corresponding topology is called unbounded m-topology (or um-topology). We show that, for an m-complete metrizable MNVL (X,\mathcal{M}), the um-topology is metrizable iff X has a countable topological orthogonal system. In terms of um-completeness, we present a characterization of MNVLs possessing both Lebesgue's and Levi's properties. Then, we characterize MNVLs possessing simultaneously the \sigma-Lebesgue and \sigma-Levi properties in terms of sequential um-completeness. Finally, we prove that any m-bounded and um-closed set is um-compact iff the space is atomic and has Lebesgue's and Levi's properties.
