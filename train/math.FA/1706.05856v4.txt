In this paper, we present a new class of operators, which we name to be n-Ritt operators. This produces a discrete analogue of n-sectorial operators and generalizes the notion of Ritt operators. We develop a H^\infty-functional calculus for n-Ritt operators and prove an useful transference result. We also generalize the notions of quadratic functional calculus and n-R-Ritt operator and discuss some examples.
