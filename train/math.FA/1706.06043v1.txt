We study the relationship between quasihomotopy and path homotopy for Sobolev maps between manifolds. We employ singular integrals on manifolds to show that, in the critical exponent case, path homotopy implies quasihomotopy - and observe the rather surprising fact that n-quasihomotopic maps need not be path homotopic. We also study the case where the target is an aspherical manifold, e.g. a manifold with nonpositive sectional curvature, and the contrasting case of the target being a sphere.
