Interpolation Theory gives techniques for constructing spaces from two initial Banach spaces. We provide several conditions under which the restriction of a holomorphic map f:X_0+X_1 \rightarrow Y_0+Y_1 to the interpolated spaces (using some specific interpolation methods), where f_{|X_0}:X_0 \rightarrow Y_0 is compact, is also compact and holomorphic.
