This paper gives further regularity properties of the evolution family associated with a non-autonomous evolution equation \begin{equation*}\label{Abstract equation} \dot u(t)+A(t)u(t)=f(t),\ \ t\in[0,T],\ \ u(0)=u_0, \end{equation*} where A(t),\ t\in [0,T], arise from non-autonomous sesquilinear forms \mathfrak a(t,\cdot,\cdot) on a Hilbert space H with constant domain V\subset H. Results on norm continuity, compactness and results on the \textit{Gibbs} character of the evolution family are established. The abstract results are applied to the Laplacian operator with time dependent Robin boundary conditions.
