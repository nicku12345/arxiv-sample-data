This paper deals with the approximation of non-autonomous evolution equations of the form \begin{equation*}\label{Abstract equation} \dot u(t)+A(t)u(t)=f(t)\ \ t\in[0,T],\ \ u(0)=u_0. \end{equation*} where A(t),\ t\in [0,T] arise from a non-autonomous sesquilinear forms \mathfrak a(t;\cdot,\cdot) on a Hilbert space H with constant domain V\subset H. Assuming the existence of a sequence \mathfrak a_n:[0,T]\times V\times V\longrightarrow\mathbb C, n\in \mathbb N of non-autonomous forms such that the associated Cauchy problem has L^2-maximal regularity in H and \mathfrak a_n(t,u,v) converges to \mathfrak a(t,u,v) as n\to \infty, then among others we show under additional assumptions that the limit problem has L^2-maximal regularity. Further we show that the convergence is uniformly on the initial data u_0 and the inhomogeneity f.
