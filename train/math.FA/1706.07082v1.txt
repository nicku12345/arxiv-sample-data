Amenability and pseudo-amenability of  \ell^{1}(S,\omega)  is characterized, where S is a left (right) zero semigroup or it is a rectangular band semigroup. The equivalence conditions to amenability of \ell^{1}(S,\omega) are provided, where  S  is a band semigroup. For a locally compact group G, pseudo-amenability of  \ell^{1}(G,\omega)  is also discussed.
