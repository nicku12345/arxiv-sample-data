We shall develop two notions of pointwise amenability, namely pointwise Connes amenability and pointwise w^*-approximate Connes amenability, for dual Banach algebras which take the w^*-topology into account. We shall study these concepts for the Banach sequence algebras \ell^1(\omega) and the weighted semigroup algebras  \ell^{1}(\mathbb{N}_{\wedge},\omega). For a weight \omega on a discrete semigroup S, we shall investigate pointwise amenability/Connes amenability of \ell^1(S,\omega) in terms of diagonals.
