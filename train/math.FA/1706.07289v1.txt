The aim of the paper is to introduce the spaces \ell_{\infty}^{\lambda}(\widehat{F}) and \ell_{p}^{\lambda}(\widehat{F}) derived by the composition of the two infinite matrices \Lambda=(\lambda_{nk}) and \widehat{F}=\left( f_{nk} \right), which are the BK-spaces of non-absolute type and also derive some inclusion relations. Further, we determine the \alpha-, \beta-, \gamma-duals of those spaces and also construct the basis for \ell_{p}^{\lambda}(\widehat{F}). Additionally, we characterize some matrix classes on the spaces \ell_{\infty}^{\lambda}(\widehat{F}) and \ell_{p}^{\lambda}(\widehat{F}). We also investigate some geometric properties concerning Banach-Saks type p. Here we characterize the subclasses \mathcal{K}(X:Y) of compact operators, where X\in\{\ell_{\infty}^{\lambda}(\widehat{F}),\ell_{p}^{\lambda}(\widehat{F})\} and Y\in\{c_{0},c, \ell_{\infty}, \ell_{1}, bv\} by applying the Hausdorff measure of non-compactness, and 1\leq p<\infty.
