We derive in this preprint the exact up to multiplicative constant non-asymptotical estimates for the norms of some non-linear in general case operators, for example, the so-called maximal functional operators, in two probabilistic rearrangement invariant norm: exponential Orlicz and Grand Lebesgue Spaces.   We will use also the theory of the so-called Grand Lebesgue Spaces (GLS) of measurable functions.
