We study two notions of approximate Birkhoff-James orthogonality in a normed space, from a geometric point of view, and characterize them in terms of normal cones. We further explore the interconnection between normal cones and approximate Birkhoff-James orthogonality to obtain a complete characterization of normal cones in a two-dimensional smooth Banach space. We also obtain a uniqueness theorem for approximate Birkhoff-James orthogonality set in a normed space.
