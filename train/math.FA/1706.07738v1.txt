An exact phase-retrievable frame \{f_{i}\}_{i}^{N} for an n-dimensional Hilbert space is a phase-retrievable frame that fails to be phase-retrievable if any one element is removed from the frame. Such a frame could have different lengths. We shall prove that for the real Hilbert space case, exact phase-retrievable frame of length N exists for every 2n-1\leq N\leq n(n+1)/2. For arbitrary frames we introduce the concept of redundancy with respect to its phase-retrievability and the concept of frames with exact PR-redundancy. We investigate the phase-retrievability by studying its maximal phase-retrievable subspaces with respect to a given frame which is not necessarily phase-retrievable. These maximal PR-subspaces could have different dimensions. We are able to identify the one with the largest dimension, which can be considered as a generalization of the characterization for phase-retrievable frames. In the basis case, we prove that if M is a k-dimensional PR-subspace, then |supp(x)| \geq k for every nonzero vector x\in M. Moreover, if 1\leq k< [(n+1)/2], then a k-dimensional PR-subspace is maximal if and only if there exists a vector x\in M such that |supp(x) | = k.
