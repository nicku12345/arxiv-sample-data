We characterize the properties (z) and (az) for an operator T whose dual T^* has the SVEP on the complementary of the upper semi-Weyl spectrum of T. If S and T are Banach space operators satisfying property (z) or (az), we give conditions on S and T to ensure the preservation of these properties by the direct sum S\oplus T. Some results are given for multipliers and in general for (H)-operators. Also we give a correct proof of \cite[Theorem 2.3]{SZ} which was proved by using the equality \sigma_p^0(S\oplus T)= \sigma_p^0(S)\cup \sigma_p^0(T). However this equality is not true; we give counterexamples to show that.
