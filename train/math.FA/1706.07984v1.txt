Given a suitably normalized X\in\mathbb{R}^n we observe that the function \theta\mapsto\mathbb{E}|X\cdot\theta|, defined for \theta\in S^{n-1}, admits surprisingly strong concentration far surpassing what is expected on account of L\'evy's isoperimetric inequality. Among the measures to which the above holds are all log-concave measures, for which a solution of the similar problem concerning the third marginal moments \theta\mapsto\mathbb{E} (X\cdot \theta)^3 would imply the hyperplane conjecture.
