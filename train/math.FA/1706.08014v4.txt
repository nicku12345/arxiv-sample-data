Found are conditions on a scalar type spectral operator A in a complex Banach space necessary and sufficient for all weak solutions of the evolution equation \begin{equation*} y'(t)=Ay(t),\ t\ge 0, \end{equation*} to be strongly Gevrey ultradifferentiable of order \beta\ge 1, in particular analytic or entire, on [0,\infty). Certain inherent smoothness improvement effects are analyzed.
