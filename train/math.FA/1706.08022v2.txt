We provide an alternative proof to those by Shkarin and by Bayart and Matheron that the operator D of complex differentiation supports a hypercyclic algebra on the space of entire functions. In particular we obtain hypercyclic algebras for many convolution operators not induced by polynomials, such as \mbox{cos}(D), De^D, or e^D-aI, where 0<a\le 1. In contrast, weighted composition operators on function algebras of analytic functions on a plane domain fail to support supercyclic algebras. Non-trivial translations on the space of complex-valued, smooth functions on the real line do support hypercyclic algebras.
