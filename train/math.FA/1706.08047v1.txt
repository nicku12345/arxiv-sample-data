In this paper, we introduce two notions of a relative operator (\alpha, \beta)-entropy and a Tsallis relative operator (\alpha, \beta)-entropy as two parameter extensions of the relative operator entropy and the Tsallis relative operator entropy. We apply a perspective approach to prove the joint convexity or concavity of these new notions, under certain conditions concerning \alpha and \beta. Indeed, we give the parametric extensions, but in such a manner that they remain jointly convex or jointly concave.
