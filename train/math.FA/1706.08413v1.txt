Given a non-quasianalytic subadditive weight function \omega we consider the weighted Schwartz space \mathcal{S}_\omega and the short-time Fourier transform on \mathcal{S}_\omega, \mathcal{S}'_\omega and on the related modulation spaces with exponential weights. In this setting we define the \omega-wave front set WF'_\omega(u) and the Gabor \omega-wave front set WF^G_\omega(u) of u\in\mathcal{S}'_{\omega}, and we prove that they coincide. Finally we look at applications of this wave front set for operators of differential and pseudo-differential type.
