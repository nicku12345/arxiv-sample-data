A known classical method of extension of smooth local maps of Banach spaces uses smooth bump functions. However, such functions are absent in the majority of infinite-dimensional Banach spaces. This is an obstacle in the development of local analysis, in particular in the questions of extending local maps onto the whole space. We suggest an approach that substitutes bump functions with special maps, which we call blid maps. It allows us to extend smooth local maps from non-smooth spaces, such as C^q[0,1], q=0,1,.... As an example of applications, we show how to reconstruct a map from its derivatives at a point, for spaces possessing blid maps. We also show how blid maps can assist in finding global solutions to cohomological equations having linear transformation of argument.
