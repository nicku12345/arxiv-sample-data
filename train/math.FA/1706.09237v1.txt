There are two notions of approximate Birkhoff-James orthogonality in a normed space. We characterize both the notions of approximate Birkhoff-James orthogonality in the space of bounded linear operators defined on a normed space. A complete characterization of approximate Birkhoff-James orthogonality in the space of bounded linear operators defined on Hilbert space of any dimension is obtained which improves on the recent result by Chmieli\'nski et al. [ J. Chmieli\'nski, T. Stypula and P. W\'ojcik, \textit{Approximate orthogonality in normed spaces and its applications}, Linear Algebra and its Applications, \textbf{531} (2017), 305--317.], in which they characterized approximate Birkhoff-James orthogonality of linear operators on finite dimensional Hilbert space and also of compact operators on any Hilbert space.
