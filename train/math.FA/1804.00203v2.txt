The Gram matrix is defined for Bessel sequences by combining synthesis with subsequent analysis operators. If different sequences are used and an operator U is inserted we reach so called U-cross Gram matrices. This can be seen as reinterpretation of the matrix representation of operators using frames. In this paper we investigate some necessary or sufficient conditions for Schatten p-class properties and the invertibility of U-cross Gram matrices. In particular, we show that under mild conditions the pseudo-inverse of a U-cross Gram matrix can always be represented as a U-cross Gram matrix with dual frames of the given ones. We link some properties of U-cross Gram matrices to approximate duals. Finally, we state several stability results. More precisely, it is shown that the invertibility of U-cross Gram matrices is preserved under small perturbations.
