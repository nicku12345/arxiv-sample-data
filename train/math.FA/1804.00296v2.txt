This paper provides a class of complex symmetric weighted composition operators on H^2(\mathbb{D}) to includes the unitary subclass, the Hermitian subclass and the normal subclass obtained by Bourdon and Noor. A characterization of algebraic weighted composition operator with degree no more than two is provided to illustrate that the weight function of a complex symmetric weighted composition operator is not necessarily linear fractional. \end{abstract}
