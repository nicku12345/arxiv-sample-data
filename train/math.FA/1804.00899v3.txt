The primary purpose of the present paper is to investigate when relations of the types |AB|=|A||B|, |A\pm B|\leq |A|+|B|, ||A|-|B||\leq |A\pm B| and |\overline{\text{Re} A}|\leq |A| (among others) hold in an unbounded operator setting. As interesting consequences, we obtain a characterization of (unbounded) self-adjointness as well as a characterization of invertibility for the class of unbounded normal operators.
