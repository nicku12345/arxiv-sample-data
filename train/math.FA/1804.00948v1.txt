We prove that if \omega _1 and \omega _2 are moderate weights and \mascB is a suitable (quasi-)Banach function space, then a necessary and sufficient condition for the embedding i\, :\, M (\omega _1,\mascB )\to M (\omega _2,\mascB ) between two modulation spaces to be compact is that the quotient \omega _2/\omega _1 vanishes at infinity. Moreover we show, that the boundedness of \omega _2/\omega _1 a necessary and sufficient condition for the previous embedding to be continuous.
