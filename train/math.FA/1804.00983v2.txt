For each non-negative integer n let \mathcal{A}_n be an n+1 by n+1 Toeplitz matrix over a finite field, F, and suppose for each n that \mathcal{A}_n is embedded in the upper left corner of \mathcal{A}_{n+1}. We study the structure of the sequence \nu = \{\nu_n :n \in \mathbb{Z}^+\}, where \nu_n = \text{null}(\mathcal{A}_n) is the nullity of \mathcal{A}_{n}. For each n\in \mathbb{Z}^+ and each nullity pattern \nu_0,\nu_1,\dots,\nu_n, we count the number of strings of Toeplitz matrices \mathcal{A}_0,\mathcal{A}_1,\dots,\mathcal{A}_{n} with this pattern. As an application we present an elementary proof of a result of D. E. Daykin on the number of n\times n Toeplitz matrices over GF(2) of any specified rank.
