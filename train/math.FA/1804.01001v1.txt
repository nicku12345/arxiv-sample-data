In this paper, we consider the boundedness of a class of sublinear operators and their commutators by with rough kernels associated with Calderon-Zygmund operator, Hard-Littlewood maximal operator, fractional integral operator, fractional maximal operator by with rough kernels both on vanishing generalized Morrey spaces and vanishing Morrey spaces, respectively.
