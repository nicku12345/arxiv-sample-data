Let I be a countably infinite index set, and let X be a Banach sequence space over I. In this article, we characterize disjoint hypercyclic and supercyclic weighted pseudo-shift operators on X in terms of the weights, the OP-basis, and the shift mappings on I. Also, the shifts on weighted L^p spaces of a directed tree and the operator weighted shifts on \ell^2(\mathbb{Z,\mathcal{K}}) are investigated as special cases.
