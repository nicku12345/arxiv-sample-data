For a measure space (\Omega, \Sigma, \mu) with a positive finite measure \mu, and a positive real number p, we define the space L_p^{+}(\mu)=L_p^{+} of all (equivalence classes of) \Sigma-measurable complex functions f defined on \Omega such that the function \left(\log^+|f|\right)^p is integrable with respect to \mu .We define the metric d_p on L^{+}_p which generalizes the metric introduced by Gamelin and Lumer in [G] for the case p=1. It is shown that the space L^{+}_p is a topological algebra. On the other hand, one can define on the space L_p^{+} an equivalent F-norm | \cdot|_p that makes L_p^{+} into an Orlicz space. For the case of the normalized Lebesgue's measure dt/2\pi on [0,2\pi), it follows that the class N^p(1<p<\infty) introduced by I. I. Privalov in [P], may be considered as a generalization of the Smirnov class N^+. Furthermore, N^p(1<p<\infty) with the associated modular becomes an Hardy-Orlicz class. Finally, for a strictly positive and measurable on [0,2\pi) function w, we define the generalized Orlicz space L_p^{w}(\mathrm{d}t/2\pi)=L^w_p with the modular \rho^w_p given by the function \psi_w(t,u)=\big(\log(1+uw(t))\big)^p, with a "weight" w. We observe that the space L^w_p is a generalized Orlicz space with respect to the modular \rho^w_p. We examine and compare different topologies induced on L^w_p by corresponding "weights" w.
