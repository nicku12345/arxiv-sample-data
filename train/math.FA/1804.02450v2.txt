The frame set of a function g\in L^2(\mathbb{R}) is the subset of all parameters (a, b)\in \mathbb{R}^2_+ for which the time-frequency shifts of g along a\mathbb{Z}\times b\mathbb{Z} form a Gabor frame for L^2(\mathbb{R}). In this paper, we investigate the frame set of a class of functions that we call \emph{generalized B-splines} and which includes the B-splines. In particular, we add many new points to the frame sets of these functions. In the process, we generalize and unify some recent results on the frame sets for this class of functions.
