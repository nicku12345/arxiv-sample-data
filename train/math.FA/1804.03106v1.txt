Fixed a continuous kernel K on the d-dimensional torus, we consider a generalization of the univariate sk-spline to the torus, associated with the kernel K. It is proved an estimate which provides the rate of convergence of a given function by its interpolating sk-splines, in the norm of L^q for functions of the type f=K*\varphi where \varphi \in L^p and 1\leq p \leq 2 \leq q \leq \infty,\ 1/p - 1/q \geq 1/2. The rate of convergence is obtained for functions f in Sobolev classes and this rate gives optimal error estimate of the same order as best trigonometric approximation, in a special case.
