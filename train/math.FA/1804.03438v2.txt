We consider sequences in a Hilbert space \mathcal H of the form (T^nf_0)_{n\in I}, with a linear operator T, the index set being either I = \mathbb N or I = \mathbb Z, a vector f_0\in \mathcal H, and answer the following two related questions: (a) {\it Which frames for \mathcal H are of this form with an at least closable operator T?} and (b) {\it For which bounded operators T and vectors f_0 is (T^nf_0)_{n\in I} a frame for \mathcal H?} As a consequence of our results, it turns out that an overcomplete Gabor or wavelet frame can never be written in the form (T^nf_0)_{n\in\mathbb N} with a bounded operator T. The corresponding problem for I = \mathbb Z remains open. Despite the negative result for Gabor and wavelet frames, the results demonstrate that the class of frames that can be represented in the form (T^nf_0)_{n\in\mathbb N} with a bounded operator T is significantly larger than what could be expected from the examples known so far.
