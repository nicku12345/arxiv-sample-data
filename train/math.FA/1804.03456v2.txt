Let 1\le p<\infty. A symmetric space X on [0,1] is said to be p-disjointly homogeneous (resp. restricted p-disjointly homogeneous) if every sequence of normalized pairwise disjoint functions from X (resp. characteristic functions) contains a subsequence equivalent in X to the unit vector basis of l_p. Answering a question posed recently, we construct, for each 1\le p<\infty, a restricted p-disjointly homogeneous symmetric space, which is not p-disjointly homogeneous. Moreover, we prove that the property of p-disjoint homogeneity is preserved under Banach isomorphisms.
