We prove that if 1 \leq p, q \leq \infty, then the spaces L_p +L_q and L_p \cap L_q are isomorphic if and only if p = q. In particular, L_2 +L_{\infty} and L_2 \cap L_{\infty} are not isomorphic which is an answer to a question formulated in the paper S. V. Astashkin and L. Maligranda, \textit{L_p + L_{\infty} and L_p \cap L_{\infty} are not isomorphic for all 1 \leq p < \infty, p \neq 2}, Proc. Amer. Math. Soc. 146 (2018), no. 5, 2181--2194.
