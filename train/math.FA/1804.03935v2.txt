Let X be a Banach space and \mathcal{K} be a compact subset in X. We consider a greedy algorithm for finding an n-dimensional subspace V_n\subset X which can be used to approximate the elements of \mathcal{K}. We are interested in how well the space V_n approximates the elements of \mathcal{K}. For this purpose we compare the performance of greedy algorithm measured by \sigma_n(\mathcal{K})_X:=\text{dist}(\mathcal{K},V_n)_X with the Kolmogorov width d_n(\mathcal{K})_X which is the best possible error one can achieve when approximating \mathcal{K} by n-dimensional subspaces. Various results in this direction have been given, e.g., in Binev et al. (SIAM J. Math. Anal. (2011)), DeVore et al. (Constr. Approx. (2013)) and Wojtaszczyk (J. Math. Anal. Appl. (2015)). The purpose of the present paper is to continue this line. We shall show that there exists a constant C>0 such that  \sigma_n(\mathcal{K})_X\leq C n^{-s+\mu}\big(\log(n+2)\big)^{\min(s,1/2)}, \quad \ n\geq 1\,,  if Kolmogorov widths d_n(\mathcal{K})_X decay as n^{-s} and the Banach-Mazur distance between an arbitrary n-dimensional subspace V_n \subset X and \ell_2^n satisfies d(V_n,\ell_2^n)\leq C_1 n^\mu. In particular, when some additional information about the set \mathcal{K} is given then there is no logarithmic factor in this estimate.
