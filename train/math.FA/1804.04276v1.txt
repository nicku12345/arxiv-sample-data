The classical Truncated Moment problem asks for necessary and sufficient conditions so that a linear functional L on \mathcal{P}_{d}, the vector space of real n-variable polynomials of degree at most d, can be written as integration with respect to a positive Borel measure \mu on \mathbb{R}^n. We work in a more general setting, where L is a linear functional acting on a finite dimensional vector space V of Borel-measurable functions defined on a T_{1} topological space S. Using an iterative geometric construction, we associate to L a subset of S called the \textit{core variety}, \mathcal{CV}(L). Our main result is that L has a representing measure \mu if and only if \mathcal{CV}(L) is nonempty. In this case, L has a finitely atomic representing measure, and the union of the supports of such measures is precisely \mathcal{CV}(L). We also use the core variety to describe the facial decomposition of the cone of functionals in the dual space V^{*} having representing measures. We prove a generalization of the Truncated Riesz-Haviland Theorem of Curto-Fialkow, which permits us to solve a generalized Truncated Moment Problem in terms of positive extensions of L. These results are adapted to derive a Riesz-Haviland Theorem for a generalized Full Moment Problem and to obtain a core variety theorem for the latter problem.
