An abstract sampling theory associated to a unitary representation of a countable discrete non abelian group G, which is a semi-direct product of groups, on a separable Hilbert space is studied. A suitable expression of the data samples and the use of a filter bank formalism allows to fix the mathematical problem to be solved: the search of appropriate dual frames for \ell^2(G). An example involving crystallographic groups illustrates the obtained results by using average or pointwise samples.
