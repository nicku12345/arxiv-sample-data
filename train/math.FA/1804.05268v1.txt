A transfunction is a function which maps between sets of finite measures on measurable spaces.   Push-forward operators form one important class of examples of transfunctions and are identified with their respective measurable functions. In this regard, transfunctions are a generalization of measurable functions between measurable spaces. Additionally, there are naturally arising transfunctions with nice properties which are not measurable functions.   Transfunctions which are weakly \sigma-additive (commutable with addition over countable sequences of orthogonal measures) between second-countable metric spaces are of particular interest and are primarily developed in this paper. We study such transfunctions which are localized: sending source measures carried by small open sets to target measures also carried by small open sets.   With the right settings and assumptions, we develop some theorems which characterize continuous functions and measurable functions, and show that the behavior of localized transfunctions can be approximated by measurable functions and by continuous functions, but only up to some error. We also characterize transfunctions that correspond to Markov operators.   In our investigation of transfunctions we are motivated by several potential applications, including Monge-Kantorovich transportation problem or population dynamics that will be presented in some detail in this paper.
