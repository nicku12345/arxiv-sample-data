Relatively recently it was proved that if \Gamma is an arbitrary set, then any equivalent norm on c_0(\Gamma) can be approximated uniformly on bounded sets by polyhedral norms and C^\infty smooth norms, with arbitrary precision. We extend this result to more classes of spaces having uncountable symmetric bases, such as preduals of the `discrete' Lorentz spaces d(w,1,\Gamma), and certain symmetric Nakano spaces and Orlicz spaces. We also show that, given an arbitrary ordinal number \alpha, there exists a scattered compact space K having Cantor-Bendixson height at least \alpha, such that every equivalent norm on C(K) can be approximated as above.
