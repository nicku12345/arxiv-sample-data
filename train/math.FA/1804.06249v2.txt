In this paper we introduce a nonlinear version of the notion of Anzellotti's pairing between divergence--measure vector fields and functions of bounded variation, motivated by possible applications to evolutionary quasilinear problems. As a consequence of our analysis, we prove a generalized Gauss--Green formula.
