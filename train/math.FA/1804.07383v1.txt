Answering on the question of S.R.Treil [23], for every \delta, 0<\delta<1, examples of contractions are constructed such that their characteristic functions F\in H^\infty(\mathcal E\to\mathcal E_\ast) satisfy the conditions \|F(z)x\|\geq\delta\|x\| \ \text{ and } \ \dim\mathcal E_\ast\ominus F(z)\mathcal E =1 \ \text{ for every } \ z\in\mathbb D, \ \ x\in\mathcal E, but F are not left invertible. Also, it is shown that the condition \sup_{z\in\mathbb D}\|I-F(z)^\ast F(z)\|_{\frak S_1}<\infty, where \frak S_1 is the trace class of operators, which is sufficient for the left invertibility of the operator-valued function F satisfying the estimate \|F(z)x\|\geq\delta\|x\| for every z\in\mathbb D, x\in\mathcal E, with some \delta>0 (S.R.Treil, [22]), is necessary for the left invertibility of an inner function F such that \dim\mathcal E_\ast\ominus F(z)\mathcal E<\infty for some z\in\mathbb D.
