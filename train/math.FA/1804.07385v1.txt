It is known that if T is a contraction of class C_{10} and I-T^\ast T is of trace class, then T is a quasiaffine transform of a unilateral shift. Also it is known that if the multiplicity of a unilateral shift is infinite, the converse is not true. In this paper the converse for a finite multiplicity is proved: if T is a contraction and T is a quasiaffine transform of a unilateral shift of finite multiplicity, then I-T^\ast T is of trace class. As a consequence we obtain that if a contraction T has finite multiplicity and its characteristic function has an outer left scalar multiple, then I-T^\ast T is of trace class.   Also, it is known that if a contraction T on a Hilbert space \mathcal H is such that \|b_\lambda(T)x\|\geq\delta\|x\| for every \lambda\in\mathbb D, x\in\mathcal H, with some \delta>0, and \sup_{\lambda\in\mathbb D}\|I-b_\lambda(T)^\ast b_\lambda(T)\|_{\frak S_1}<\infty (here b_\lambda is a Blaschke factor and \frak S_1 is the trace class of operators), then T is similar to an isometry. In this paper the converse for a finite multiplicity is proved: if T is a contraction and T is similar to an isometry of finite multiplicity, then T satisfies the above conditions.
