Two frames \{\phi_{i}\}_{i \in I} and \{\psi_{i}\}_{i \in I} for a separable Hilbert space H are woven if there are positive constants A \leq B such that for every subset \sigma \subset I, the family \{\phi_{i}\}_{i \in \sigma} \cup \{\psi_{i}\}_{i \in \sigma^{c}} is a frame for H with frame bounds A, B. Bemrose et al. introduced weaving frames in separable Hilbert spaces and observed that weaving frames has potential applications in signal processing. Motivated by this, and the recent work of Balan in the direction of application of vector-valued frames (or superframes) in signal processing, we study vector-valued weaving frames. In this paper, first we give some fundamental properties of vector-valued weaving frames. It is shown that if a family of vector-valued frames is woven, then the corresponding family of frames for atomic spaces is woven, but the converse is not true. We present a technique for the construction of vector-valued woven frames from given woven frames for atomic spaces . Necessary and sufficient conditions for vector-valued weaving Riesz sequences are given. Several numerical examples are given to illustrate the results.
