A general interpolation problem with operator argument is studied for functions f from the de Branges-Rovnyak space H(s) associated with an analytic function s mapping the open unit disk D into the closed unit disk. The interpolation condition is taken in the Rosenblum-Rovnyak form f(A)c = b (with a suitable interpretation of f(A)c) for given Hilbert space operator A and two vectors b; c from the same space.
