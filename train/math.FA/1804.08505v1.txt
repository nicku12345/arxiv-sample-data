For discrete-time causal linear input/state/output systems, the Bounded Real Lemma explains (under suitable hypotheses) the contractivity of the values of the transfer function over the unit disk for such a system in terms of the existence of a positive-definite solution of a certain Linear Matrix Inequality (the Kalman-Yakubovich-Popov (KYP) inequality). Recent work has extended this result to the setting of infinite-dimensional state space and associated non-rationality of the transfer function, where at least in some cases unbounded solutions of the generalized KYP-inequality are required. This paper is the second installment in a series of papers on the Bounded Real Lemma and the KYP inequality. We adapt Willems' storage-function approach to the infinite-dimensional linear setting, and in this way reprove various results presented in the first installment, where they were obtained as applications of infinite-dimensional State-Space-Similarity theorems, rather than via explicit computation of storage functions.
