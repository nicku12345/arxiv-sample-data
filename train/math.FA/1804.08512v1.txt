The matrix-valued {Bezout-corona} problem G(z)X(z)=I_m, |z|<1, is studied in a Wiener space setting, that is, the given function G is an analytic matrix function on the unit {disc} whose Taylor coefficients are absolutely summable and the same is required for the solutions X. It turns out that all Wiener solutions can be described explicitly in terms of two matrices and a square analytic Wiener function Y satisfying \det Y(z)\not =0 for all |z|\leq 1. It is also shown that some of the results hold in the H^\infty {setting, but} not all. In fact, if G is an H^\infty function, then Y is just an H^2 function. Nevertheless, in this case, using the two matrices and the function Y, all H^2 solutions to the Bezout-corona problem can be described explicitly in a form analogous to the one appearing in the Wiener setting.
