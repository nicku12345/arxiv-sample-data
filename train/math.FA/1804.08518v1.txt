This paper deals with the Bezout equation G(s)X(s)=I_m, \Re s \geq 0, in the Wiener space of analytic matrix-valued functions on the right half plane. In particular, G is an m\times p matrix-valued analytic Wiener function, where p\geq m, and the solution X is required to be an analytic Wiener function of size p\times m. The set of all solutions is described explicitly in terms of a p\times p matrix-valued analytic Wiener function Y, which has an inverse in the analytic Wiener space, and an associated inner function \Theta defined by Y and the value of G at infinity. Among the solutions, one is identified that minimizes the H^2-norm. A Wiener space version of Tolokonnikov's lemma plays an important role in the proofs. The results presented are natural analogs of those obtained for the discrete case in [11].
