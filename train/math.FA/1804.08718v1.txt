In this paper, we investigate the boundedness of maximal operator and its commutators in generalized Orlicz-Morrey spaces on the spaces of homogeneous type. As an application of this boundedness, we give necessary and sufficient condition for the Adams type boundedness of fractional integral and its commutators in these spaces. We also discuss criteria for the boundedness of these operators in Orlicz spaces.
