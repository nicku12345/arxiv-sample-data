In the given paper we first introduce \bar{N}_{\Delta^{-}}^{q} summable difference sequence spaces and prove some properties of these spaces. We then obtain the necessary and sufficient conditions for infinite matrices A to map these sequence spaces on the spaces c_0, c and \ell_\infty, the Hausdorff measure of noncompactness is then used to obtain the necessary and sufficient conditions for the compactness of the linear operators defined on these spaces.
