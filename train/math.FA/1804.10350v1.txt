A Banach space X is said to have Efremov's property (\mathcal{E}) if every element of the weak^*-closure of a convex bounded set C \subseteq X^* is the weak^*-limit of a sequence in C. By assuming the Continuum Hypothesis, we prove that there exist maximal almost disjoint families of infinite subsets of \mathbb{N} for which the corresponding Johnson-Lindenstrauss spaces enjoy (resp. fail) property (\mathcal{E}). This is related to a gap in [A. Plichko, Three sequential properties of dual Banach spaces in the weak^* topology, Topology Appl. 190 (2015), 93--98] and allows to answer (consistently) questions of Plichko and Yost.
