For a matrix-valued function \Phi\in L^2_{M_{n\times m}}, it is well-known that the kernel of a block Hankel operator H_\Phi is an invariant subspace for the shift operator. Thus, if the kernel is nontrivial, then \ker H_\Phi= \Theta H^2_{\mathbb C^r} for a natural number r and an m\times r matrix inner function \Theta by Beurling-Lax-Halmos Theorem. It will be shown that the size of the matrix inner function \Theta associated with the kernel of a block Hankel operator H_\Phi is closely related with a certain independency of the columns of \Phi, which is defined in this paper. As an important application of this result, the shape of shift invariant, or, backward shift invariant subspaces of H^2_{\mathbb C^n} generated by finite elements will be studied.
