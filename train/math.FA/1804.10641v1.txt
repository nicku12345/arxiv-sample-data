We prove that any pair of reasonable cross norms defined on the tensor product of n Banach spaces induce (2k)^{n-1}-Lipschitz equivalent metrics (and thus, a unique topology) on the set S^k_{X_1,\ldots, X_n} of vectors of rank \leq k. With this, we define the Segre cone of Banach spaces, \Sigma_{X_1,\ldots, X_n}, and state when S^k_{X_1,\ldots, X_n} is closed. We introduce an auxiliary mapping (a \Sigma-operator) that allows us to study multilinear mappings with a geometrical point of view. We use the isometric correspondence between multilinear mappings and Lipschitz \Sigma-operators, to have a strategy to generalize ideal properties from the linear to the multilinear settitng.
