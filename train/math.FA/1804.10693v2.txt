Let \mathcal H be the Drury-Arveson or Dirichlet space of the unit ball of \mathbb C^d. The weak product \mathcal H\odot\mathcal H of \mathcal H is the collection of all functions h that can be written as h=\sum_{n=1}^\infty f_n g_n, where \sum_{n=1}^\infty \|f_n\|\|g_n\|<\infty. We show that \mathcal H\odot\mathcal H is contained in the Smirnov class of \mathcal H, i.e. every function in \mathcal H\odot\mathcal H is a quotient of two multipliers of \mathcal H, where the function in the denominator can be chosen to be cyclic in \mathcal H. As a consequence we show that the map \mathcal N \to clos_{\mathcal H\odot\mathcal H} \mathcal N establishes a 1-1 and onto correspondence between the multiplier invariant subspaces of \mathcal H and of \mathcal H\odot\mathcal H.   The results hold for many weighted Besov spaces \mathcal H in the unit ball of \mathbb C^d provided the reproducing kernel has the complete Pick property. One of our main technical lemmas states that for weighted Besov spaces \mathcal H that satisfy what we call the multiplier inclusion condition any bounded column multiplication operator \mathcal H \to \oplus_{n=1}^\infty \mathcal H induces a bounded row multiplication operator \oplus_{n=1}^\infty \mathcal H \to \mathcal H. For the Drury-Arveson space H^2_d this leads to an alternate proof of the characterization of interpolating sequences in terms of weak separation and Carleson measure conditions.
