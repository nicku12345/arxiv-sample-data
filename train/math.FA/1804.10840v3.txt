In this paper we deal with a second order multidimensional fractional differential operator. We consider a case where the leading term represented by the uniformly elliptic operator and the final term is the Kipriyanov operator of fractional differentiation. We conduct classification of such a type of operators by belonging of their resolvent to the Schatten-von Neumann class and formulate the sufficient condition for completeness of the root functions system. Finally we obtain an asymptotic formula.
