Let X and Y be compact Hausdorff spaces, E and F be real or complex Banach spaces, and A(X,E) be a subspace of C(X,E). In this paper we study linear operators S,T: A(X,E) \lo C(Y,F) which are jointly separating, in the sense that \coz(f) \cap \coz(g) = \emptyset implies that \coz(Tf) \cap \coz(Sg)=\emptyset. Here \coz(\cdot) denotes the cozero set of a function. We characterize the general form of such maps between certain class of vector-valued (as well as scalar-valued) spaces of continuous functions including spaces of vector-valued Lipschitz functions, absolutely continuous functions and continuously differentiable functions. The results can be applied for a pair T:A(X) \lo A(X) and S:A(X,E) \lo A(X,E) of linear operators, where A(X) is a regular Banach function algebra on X, such that f\cdot g=0 implies Tf \cdot Sg=0, for f\in A(X) and g\in A(X,E). If T and S are jointly separating bijections between Banach algebras of scalar-valued functions of this class, then they induce a homeomorphism between X and Y and, furthermore, T^{-1} and S^{-1} are also jointly separating maps.
