Given an orthonormal basis    {\mathcal V}=   \{v_j\} _{j\in N} in a separable Hilbert space H and a set of unit vectors    {\mathcal B}=\{w_j\}_{j\in N}, we consider the sets  {\mathcal B}_N obtained by replacing the vectors v_1, ...,\, v_N with vectors w_1,\, ...,\, w_N. We show necessary and sufficient conditions that ensure that the sets  {\mathcal B}_N are Riesz bases of H and we estimate the frame constants of the  {\mathcal B}_N. Then, we prove conditions that ensure that  {\mathcal B} is a Riesz basis. Applications to the construction of exponential bases on domains of  R^d are also presented.
