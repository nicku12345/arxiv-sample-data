In this supplement to [GJ1], [GJ3], we give an intrinsic characterization of (bounded, linear) operators on Banach lattices which factor through Banach lattices not containing a copy of c_0 which complements the characterization of [GJ1], [GJ3] that an operator admits such a factorization if and only if it can be written as the product of two operators neither of which preserves a copy of c_0. The intrinsic characterization is that the restriction of the second adjoint of the operator to the ideal generated by the lattice in its bidual does not preserve a copy of c_0. This property of an operator was introduced by C. Niculescu [N2] under the name ``strong type B".
