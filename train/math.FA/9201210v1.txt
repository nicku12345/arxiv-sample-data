Let X be a compact Hausdorff space, let E be a Banach space, and let C(X,E) stand for the Banach space of E-valued continuous functions on X under the uniform norm. In this paper we characterize Integral operators (in the sense of Grothendieck) on C(X,E) spaces in term of their representing vector measures. This is then used to give some applications to Nuclear operators on C(X,E) spaces.
