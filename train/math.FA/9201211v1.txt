Let \Omega be a compact Hausdorff space, let E be a Banach space, and let C(\Omega, E) stand for the Banach space of all E-valued continuous functions on \Omega under supnorm. In this paper we study when nuclear operators on C(\Omega, E) spaces can be completely characterized in terms of properties of their representing vector measures. We also show that if F is a Banach space and if T:\ C(\Omega, E)\rightarrow F is a nuclear operator, then T induces a bounded linear operator T^\# from the space C(\Omega) of scalar valued continuous functions on \Omega into \slN(E,F) the space of nuclear operators from E to F, in this case we show that E^* has the Radon-Nikodym property if and only if T^\# is nuclear whenever T is nuclear.
