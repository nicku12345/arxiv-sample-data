If Z is a quotient of a subspace of a separable Banach space X, and V is any separable Banach space, then there is a Banach couple (A_0,A_1) such that A_0 and A_1 are isometric to X\oplus V, and any intermediate space obtained using the real or complex interpolation method contains a complemented subspace isomorphic to Z. Thus many properties of Banach spaces, including having non-trivial cotype, having the Radon-Nikodym property, and having the analytic unconditional martingale difference sequence property, do not pass to intermediate spaces.
