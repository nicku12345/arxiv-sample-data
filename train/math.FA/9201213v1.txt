General permutations acting on the Haar system are investigated. We give a necessary and sufficient condition for permutations to induce an isomorphism on dyadic BMO. Extensions of this characterization to Lipschitz spaces \lip, (0<p\leq1) are obtained. When specialized to permutations which act on one level of the Haar system only, our approach leads to a short straightforward proof of a result due to E.M.Semyonov and B.Stoeckert.
