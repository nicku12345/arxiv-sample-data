Let X,Y and Z be Banach spaces, and let \prod_p(Y,Z) (1\leq p<\infty) denote the space of p-summing operators from Y to Z. We show that, if X is a {\it \}_\infty-space, then a bounded linear operator T: X\hat \otimes_\epsilon Y\longrightarrow Z is 1-summing if and only if a naturally associated operator T^#: X\longrightarrow \prod_1(Y,Z) is 1-summing. This result need not be true if X is not a {\it \}_\infty-space. For p>1, several examples are given with X=C[0,1] to show that T^# can be p-summing without T being p-summing. Indeed, there is an operator T on C[0,1]\hat \otimes_\epsilon \ell_1 whose associated operator T^# is 2-summing, but for all N\in \N, there exists an N-dimensional subspace U of C[0,1]\hat \otimes_\epsilon \ell_1 such that T restricted to U is equivalent to the identity operator on \ell^N_\infty. Finally, we show that there is a compact Hausdorff space K and a bounded linear operator T:\ C(K)\hat \otimes_\epsilon \ell_1\longrightarrow \ell_2 for which T^#:\ C(K)\longrightarrow \prod_1(\ell_1, \ell_2) is not 2-summing.
