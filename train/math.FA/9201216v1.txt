We introduce a concentration property for probability measures on \scriptstyle{R^n}, which we call Property~(\scriptstyle\tau); we show that this property has an interesting stability under products and contractions (Lemmas 1,~2,~3). Using property~(\scriptstyle\tau), we give a short proof for a recent deviation inequality due to Talagrand. In a third section, we also recover known concentration results for Gaussian measures using our approach.}
