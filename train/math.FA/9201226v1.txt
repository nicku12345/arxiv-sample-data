In this paper, equivalence between interpolation properties of linear operators and monotonicity conditions are studied, for a pair (X_0,X_1) of rearrangement invariant quasi Banach spaces, when the extreme spaces of the interpolation are L^\infty and a pair (A_0,A_1) under some assumptions. Weak and restricted weak intermediate spaces fall in our context. Applications to classical Lorentz and Lorentz-Orlicz spaces are given.
