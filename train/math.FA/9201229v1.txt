We give an elementary proof that the H^p spaces over the unit disc (or the upper half plane) are the interpolation spaces for the real method of interpolation between H^1 and H^\infty. This was originally proved by Peter Jones. The proof uses only the boundedness of the Hilbert transform and the classical factorisation of a function in H^p as a product of two functions in H^q and H^r with 1/q+1/r=1/p. This proof extends without any real extra difficulty to the non-commutative setting and to several Banach space valued extensions of H^p spaces. In particular, this proof easily extends to the couple H^{p_0}(\ell_{q_0}),H^{p_1}(\ell_{q_1}), with 1\leq p_0, p_1, q_0, q_1 \leq \infty. In that situation, we prove that the real interpolation spaces and the K-functional are induced ( up to equivalence of norms ) by the same objects for the couple L_{p_0}(\ell_{q_0}), L_{p_1}(\ell_{q_1}). In another direction, let us denote by C_p the space of all compact operators x on Hilbert space such that tr(|x|^p) <\infty. Let T_p be the subspace of all upper triangular matrices relative to the canonical basis. If p=\infty, C_p is just the space of all compact operators. Our proof allows us to show for instance that the space H^p(C_p) (resp. T_p) is the interpolation space of parameter (1/p,p) between H^1(C_1) (resp. T_1) and H^\infty(C_\infty) (resp. T_\i). We also prove a similar result for the complex interpolation method. Moreover, extending a recent result of Kaftal-Larson and Weiss, we prove that the distance to the subspace of upper triangular matrices in C_1 and C_\infty can be essentially realized simultaneously by the same element.
