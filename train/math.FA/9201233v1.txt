A Banach space X is reflexive if the Mackey topology \tau(X^*,X) on X^* agrees with the norm topology on X^*. Borwein [B] calls a Banach space X {\it sequentially reflexive\/} provided that every \tau(X^*,X) convergent {\it sequence\/} in X^* is norm convergent. The main result in [B] is that X is sequentially reflexive if every separable subspace of X has separable dual, and Borwein asks for a characterization of sequentially reflexive spaces. Here we answer that question by proving   \proclaim Theorem. {\sl A Banach space X is sequentially reflexive if and only if \ell_1 is not isomorphic to a subspace of X.}
