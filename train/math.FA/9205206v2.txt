If \phi is a submeasure satisfying an appropriate lower estimate we give a quantitative result on the total mass of a measure \mu satisfying 0\le\mu\le\phi. We give a dual result for supermeasures and then use these results to investigate convexity on non-locally convex quasi-Banach lattices. We then show how to use these results to extend some factorization theorems due to Pisier to the setting of quasi-Banach spaces. We conclude by showing that if X is a quasi-Banach space of cotype two then any operator T:C(\Omega)\to X is 2-absolutely summing and factors through a Hilbert space and discussing general factorization theorems for cotype two spaces.
