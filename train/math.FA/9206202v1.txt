We are interested in the question when a Banach space X with an unconditional basis is isomorphic (as a Banach space) to an order-continuous nonatomic Banach lattice. We show that this is the case if and only if X is isomorphic as a Banach space with X(\ell_2). This and results of J. Bourgain are used to show that spaces H_1(\bold T^n) are not isomorphic to nonatomic Banach lattices. We also show that tent spaces introduced in \cite{4} are isomorphic to Rad H_1.
