A topological space X is called \Cal A-real compact, if every algebra homomorphism from \Cal A to the reals is an evaluation at some point of X, where \Cal A is an algebra of continuous functions. Our main interest lies on algebras of smooth functions. In \cite{AdR} it was shown that any separable Banach space is smoothly real compact. Here we generalize this result to a huge class of locally convex spaces including arbitrary products of separable Fr\'echet spaces.
