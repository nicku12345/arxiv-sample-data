We give necessary and sufficient conditions for interpolation inequalities of the type considered by Marcinkiewicz and Zygmund to be true in the case of Banach space-valued polynomials and Jacobi weights and nodes. We also study the vector-valued expansion problem of L_p-functions in terms of Jacobi polynomials and consider the question of unconditional convergence. The notion of type p with respect to orthonormal systems leads to some characterizations of Hilbert spaces. It is also shown that various vector-valued Jacobi means are equivalent.
