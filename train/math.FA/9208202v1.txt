Let X be a Banach space and 1\le p<\infty. We prove interpolation inequalities of Marcinkiewicz-Zygmund type for X-valued polynomials g of degree \le n on R,   \[c_p (\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n+1} \mu_i \| g(t_i)e^{-t_i^2 /2} \|^p)^{1/p} \le (\int\limits_{\RR}^{} \|g(t)e^{-t^2 /2} \|^p dt)^{1/p} \le d_p (\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n+1} \mu_i \|g(t_i)e^{-t_i^2 /2} \|^p)^{1/p}\;\;,\]   where (t_i)_1^{n+1} are the zeros of the Hermite polynomial H_{n+1} and (\mu_i)_1^{n+1} are suitable weights. The validity of the right inequality requires 1<p<4 and X being a UMD-space. This implies a mean convergence theorem for the Lagrange interpolation polynomials of continuous functions on R taken at the zeros of the Hermite polynomials. In the scalar case, this improves a result of Nevai [N]. Moreover, we give vector-valued extensions of the mean convergence results of Askey-Wainger [AW] in the case of Hermite expansions.
