In this note we investigate some aspects of the local structure of finite dimensional p-Banach spaces. The well known theorem of Gluskin gives a sharp lower bound of the diameter of the Minkowski compactum. In [Gl] it is proved that diam({\cal M}_n^1)\geq cn for some absolute constant c. Our purpose is to study this problem in the p-convex setting. In [Pe], T. Peck gave an upper bound of the diameter of {\cal M}_n^p, the class of all n-dimensional p-normed spaces, namely, diam({\cal M}_n^p)\leq n^{2/p-1}. We will show that such bound is optimum.
