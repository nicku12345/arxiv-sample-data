Let E be a Sidon subset of the integers and suppose X is a Banach space. Then Pisier has shown that E-spectral polynomials with values in X behave like Rademacher sums with respect to L_p-norms. We consider the situation when X is a quasi-Banach space. For general quasi-Banach spaces we show that a similar result holds if and only if E is a set of interpolation (I_0-set). However for certain special classes of quasi-Banach spaces we are able to prove such a result for larger sets. Thus if X is restricted to be ``natural'' then the result holds for all Sidon sets. We also consider spaces with plurisubharmonic norms and introduce the class of analytic Sidon sets.
