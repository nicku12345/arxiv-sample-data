We examine conditions under which a pair of re-arrangement invariant function spaces on [0,1] or [0,\infty) form a Calder\'on couple. A very general criterion is developed to determine whether such a pair is a Calder\'on couple, with numerous applications. We give, for example, a complete classification of those spaces X which form a Calder\'on couple with L_{\infty}. We specialize our results to Orlicz spaces and are able to give necessary and sufficient conditions on an Orlicz function F so that the pair (L_F,L_{\infty}) forms a Calder\'on pair.
