A subsequence principle is obtained, characterizing Banach spaces containing c_0, in the spirit of the author's 1974 characterization of Banach spaces containing \ell^1.   Definition: A sequence (b_j) in a Banach space is called {\it strongly summing\/} (s.s.) if (b_j) is a weak-Cauchy basic sequence so that whenever scalars (c_j) satisfy \sup_n \|\sum_{j=1}^n c_j b_j\| <\infty, then \sum c_j converges.   A simple permanence property: if (b_j) is an (s.s.) basis for a Banach space B and (b_j^*) are its biorthogonal functionals in B^*, then (\sum_{j=1}^n b_j^*)_{n=1}^ \infty is a non-trivial weak-Cauchy sequence in B^*; hence B^* fails to be weakly sequentially complete. (A weak-Cauchy sequence is called {\it non-trivial\/} if it is {\it non-weakly convergent\/}.)   Theorem. Every non-trivial weak-Cauchy sequence in a (real or complex) Banach space has either an {\rm (s.s.)} subsequence, or a convex block basis equivalent to the summing basis.   Remark : The two alternatives of the Theorem are easily seen to be mutually exclusive.   Corollary 1. A Banach space B contains no isomorph of c_0 if and only if every non-trivial weak-Cauchy sequence in B has an {\rm (s.s.)} subsequence.   Combining the c_0 and \ell^1 Theorems, we obtain   Corollary 2. If B is a non-reflexive Banach space such that X^* is weakly sequentially complete for all linear subspaces X of B, then c_0 embeds in X; in fact, B has property~(u).
