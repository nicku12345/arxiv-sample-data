Let  X=(X_0,X_1) and  Y=(Y_0,Y_1) be Banach couples and suppose T: X\to Y is a linear operator such that T:X_0\to Y_0 is compact. We consider the question whether the operator T:[X_0,X_1]_{\theta}\to [Y_0,Y_1]_{\theta} is compact and show a positive answer under a variety of conditions. For example it suffices that X_0 be a UMD-space or that X_0 is reflexive and there is a Banach space so that X_0=[W,X_1]_{\alpha} for some 0<\alpha<1.
