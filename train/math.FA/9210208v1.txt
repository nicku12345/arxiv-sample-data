Given any Banach space X, let L_2^X denote the Banach space of all measurable functions f:[0,1]\to X for which   ||f||_2:=(int_0^1 ||f(t)||^2 dt)^{1/2}   is finite. We show that X is a UMD--space (see \cite{BUR:1986}) if and only if   \lim_n||f-S_n(f)||_2=0 for all f\in L_2^X, where   S_n(f):=sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (f,w_i)w_i   is the n--th partial sum associated with the Walsh system (w_i).
