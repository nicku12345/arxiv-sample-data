The real part of H^\infty(\bT) is not dense in L^\infty_{\tR}(\bT). The John-Nirenberg theorem in combination with the Helson-Szeg\"o theorem and the Hunt Muckenhaupt Wheeden theorem has been used to determine whether f\in L^\infty_{\tR}(\bT) can be approximated by \Re H^\infty(\bT) or not: \dist(f,\Re H^\infty)=0 if and only if for every \e>0 there exists \l_0>0 so that for \l>\l_0 and any interval I\sbe \bT. |\{x\in I:|\tilde f-(\tilde f)_I|>\l\}|\le |I|e^{-\l/ \e}, where \tilde f denotes the Hilbert transform of f. See [G] p. 259. This result is contrasted by the following   \begin{theor} Let f\in L^\infty_{\tR} and \e>0. Then there is a function g\in H^\infty(\bT) and a set E\sb \bT so that |\bT\sm E|<\e and f=\Re g\quad\mbox{ on } E. \end{theor}   This theorem is best regarded as a corollary to Men'shov's correction theorem. For the classical proof of Men'shov's theorem see [Ba, Ch VI \S 1-\S4].   Simple proofs of Men'shov's theorem -- together with significant extensions -- have been obtained by S.V. Khruschev in [Kh] and S.V. Kislyakov in [K1], [K2] and [K3].   In [S] C. Sundberg used \bar\pa-techniques (in particular [G, Theorem VIII.1. gave a proof of Theorem 1 that does not mention Men'shov's theorem.   The purpose of this paper is to use a Marcinkiewicz decomposition on Holomorphic Martingales to give another proof of Theorem 1. In this way we avoid uniformly convergent Fourier series as well as \bar\pa-techniques.
