We prove that if X is a real rearrangement-invariant function space on [0,1], which is not isometrically isomorphic to L_2, then every surjective isometry T:X\to X is of the form Tf(s)=a(s)f(\sigma(s)) for a Borel function a and an invertible Borel map \sigma:[0,1] \to [0,1]. If X is not equal to L_p, up to renorming, for some 1\le p\le \infty then in addition |a|=1 a.e. and \sigma must be measure-preserving.
