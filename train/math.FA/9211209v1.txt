For n\geq 2, p<2 and q>2, does there exist an n-dimensional Banach space different from Hilbert spaces which is isometric to subspaces of both L_{p} and L_{q}? Generalizing the construction from the paper "Zonoids whose polars are zonoids" by R.Schneider we give examples of such spaces. Moreover, for any compact subset Q of (0,\infty)\setminus \{2k, k\in N\}, we can construct a space isometric to subspaces of L_{q} for all q\in Q simultaneously.   This paper requires vanilla.sty
