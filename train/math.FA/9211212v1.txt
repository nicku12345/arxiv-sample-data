We prove a number of decoupling inequalities for nonhomogeneous random polynomials with coefficients in Banach space. Degrees of homogeneous components enter into comparison as exponents of multipliers of terms of certain Poincar\'e-type polynomials. It turns out that the fulfillment of most of types of decoupling inequalities may depend on the geometry of Banach space.
