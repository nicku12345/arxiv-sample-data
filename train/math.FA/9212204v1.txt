We continue an investigation started in a preceding paper. We discuss the classical results of Carleson connecting Carleson measures with the \d-equation in a slightly more abstract framework than usual. We also consider a more recent result of Peter Jones which shows the existence of a solution of the \d-equation, which satisfies simultaneously a good L_\i estimate and a good L_1 estimate. This appears as a special case of our main result which can be stated as follows: Let (\Omega,\cal{A},\mu) be any measure space. Consider a bounded operator u:H^1\ra L_1(\mu). Assume that on one hand u admits an extension u_1:L^1\ra L_1(\mu) bounded with norm C_1, and on the other hand that u admits an extension u_\i:L^\i\ra L_\i(\mu) bounded with norm C_\i. Then u admits an extension \w{u} which is bounded simultaneously from L^1 into  L_1(\mu) and from L^\i into  L_\i(\mu) and satisfies \eqalign{&\|\tilde u\colon \ L_\infty \to L_\infty(\mu)\|\le CC_\infty\cr &\|\tilde u\colon \ L_1\to L_1(\mu)\|\le CC_1} where C is a numerical constant.
