Let H,K be Hilbert spaces. Let E \subset B(H) and F \subset B(K) be operator spaces in the sense of [1,2]. We study the operators u : E \to F which admit a factorization E \to OH \to F with completely bounded maps through the operator Hilbert space OH which we have introduced and studied in a recent note. We give a characterization of these operators which allows to develop a theory entirely analogous to that of operators between Banach spaces which can be factored through a Hilbert space.
