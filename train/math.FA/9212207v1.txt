Let G be a discrete group.   Let \lambda : G \to B(\ell_2(G),\ell_2(G)) be the left regular representation. A function \ph : G \to \comp is called a completely bounded multiplier (= Herz-Schur multiplier) if the transformation defined on the linear span K(G) of \{\lambda(x),x \in G\} by \sum_{x \in G} f(x) \lambda(x) \to \sum_{x \in G} f(x) \ph(x) \lambda(x) is completely bounded (in short c.b.) on the C^*-algebra C_\lambda^*(G) which is generated by \lambda (C_\lambda^*(G) is the closure of K(G) in B(\ell_2(G),\ell_2(G)).) One of our main results gives a simple characterization of the functions \ph such that \eps \ph is a c.b. multiplier on C_\lambda^*(G) for any bounded function \eps, or equivalently for any choice of signs \eps(x) = \pm 1. We also consider the case when this holds for ``almost all" choices of signs.
