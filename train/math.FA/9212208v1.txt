Let H be an infinite dimensional Hilbert space. We show that there exists a subspace of B(H) which is isometric to \ell_2 and completely isometric to its antidual in the sense of the theory of operator spaces recently developed by Blecher-Paulsen and Effros-Ruan. Moreover this space is unique up to a complete isometry. We denote it by OH. This space has several remarkable properties in particular with respect to the complex interpolation method.
