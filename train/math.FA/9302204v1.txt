A Banach space \X has the complete continuity property (CCP) if each bounded linear operator from L_1 into \X is completely continuous (i.e., maps weakly convergent sequences to norm convergent sequences). The main theorem shows that a Banach space failing the CCP (resp., failing the CCP and failing cotype) has a subspace with a finite dimensional decomposition (resp., basis) which fails the CCP.
