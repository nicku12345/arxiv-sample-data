We will prove an abstract comparision principle which translates gaussian cotype in Rademacher cotype conditions and vice versa. More precisely, let 2\!<\!q\!<\!\infty and T:\,C(K)\,\to\,F a linear, continous operator.   T is of gaussian cotype q if and only if   ( \summ_1^n (\frac{|| Tx_k||_F}{\sqrt{\log(k+1)}})^q )^{1/q} \, \le c || \summ_1^n \varepsilon_k x_k ||_{L_2(C(K))} ,   for all sequences with (|| Tx_k ||)_1^n decreasing.   T is of Rademacher cotype q if and only if   (\summ_1^n (|| Tx_k||_F \,\sqrt{\log(k+1)})^q )^{1/q} \, \le c || \summ_1^n g_k x_k ||_{L_2(C(K))} ,   for all sequences with (||Tx_k ||)_1^n decreasing.   Our methods allows a restriction to a fixed number of vectors and complements the corresponding results of Talagrand.
