This is a 30 page set of lecture notes, in Plain TeX, which were prepared for and presented as a series of lectures (10 1/2 hours over two weeks) at the 2nd Summer School on Banach Spaces, Related Areas and Applications in Prague and Paseky, Czech Republic, during August, 1993. They consist of a largely self-contained exposition of both classical and recent basic facts about maximal monotone operators on Banach spaces, motivated in part by the goal of highlighting several fundamental properties of such operators which remain open questions in nonreflexive Banach spaces.
