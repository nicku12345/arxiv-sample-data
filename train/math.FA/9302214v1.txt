Let u:A\to B be a bounded linear operator between two C^*-algebras A,B. The following result was proved by the second author.   Theorem 0.1. There is a numerical constant K_1 such that for all finite sequences x_1,\ldots, x_n in A we have \leqalignno{&\max\left\{\left\|\left(\sum u(x_i)^* u(x_i)\right)^{1/2}\right\|_B, \left\|\left(\sum u(x_i) u(x_i)^*\right)^{1/2}\right\|_B\right\}&(0.1)_1\cr \le &K_1\|u\| \max\left\{\left\|\left(\sum x^*_ix_i\right)^{1/2}\right\|_A, \left\|\left(\sum x_ix^*_i\right)^{1/2}\right\|_A\right\}.}   A simpler proof was given in [H1]. More recently an other alternate proof appeared in [LPP]. In this paper we give a sequence of generalizations of this inequality.
