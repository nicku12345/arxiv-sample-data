It is an English translation of the paper originally published in Russian and Ukrainian in 1987. In the appendix of his book S.Banach introduced the following definition Let X be a Banach space and \Gamma be a subspace of the dual space X^*. The set of all limits of w^{*}-convergent sequences in \Gamma  is called the w^*{\it -derived set} of \Gamma  and is denoted by \Gamma _{(1)}. For an ordinal \alpha the w^{*}-{\it derived set of order} \alpha  is defined inductively by the equality:  \Gamma _{(\alpha )}=\bigcup _{\beta <\alpha }((\Gamma _{(\beta )})_{(1)}.
