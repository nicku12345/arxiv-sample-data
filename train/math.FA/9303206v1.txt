If a separable Banach space X is such that for some nonquasireflexive Banach space Y there exists a surjective strictly singular operator T:X\to Y then for every countable ordinal \alpha  the dual of X contains a subspace whose weak^* sequential closures of orders less than \alpha  are not norming over any infinite-dimensional subspace of X and whose weak^* sequential closure of order \alpha +1 coincides with X^*
