A Banach space is polyhedral if the unit ball of each of its finite dimensional subspaces is a polyhedron. It is known that a polyhedral Banach space has a separable dual and is c_0-saturated, i.e., each closed infinite dimensional subspace contains an isomorph of c_0. In this paper, we show that the Orlicz sequence space h_M is isomorphic to a polyhedral Banach space if \lim_{t\to 0}M(Kt)/M(t) = \infty for some K < \infty. We also construct an Orlicz sequence space h_M which is c_0-saturated, but which is not isomorphic to any polyhedral Banach space. This shows that being c_0-saturated and having a separable dual are not sufficient for a Banach space to be isomorphic to a polyhedral Banach space.
