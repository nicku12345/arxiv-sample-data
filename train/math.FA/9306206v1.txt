Let E be an operator space in the sense of the theory recently developed by Blecher-Paulsen and Effros-Ruan. We introduce a notion of E-valued non commutative L_p-space for 1 \leq p < \infty and we prove that the resulting operator space satisfies the natural properties to be expected with respect to e.g. duality and interpolation. This notion leads to the definition of a ``completely p-summing" map which is the operator space analogue of the p-absolutely summing maps in the sense of Pietsch-Kwapie\'n. These notions extend the particular case p=1 which was previously studied by Effros-Ruan.
