We study certain interpolation and extension properties of the space of regular operators between two Banach lattices. Let R_p be the space of all the regular (or equivalently order bounded) operators on L_p equipped with the regular norm. We prove the isometric identity R_p = (R_\infty,R_1)^\theta if \theta = 1/p, which shows that the spaces (R_p) form an interpolation scale relative to Calder\'on's interpolation method. We also prove that if S\subset L_p is a subspace, every regular operator u : S \to L_p admits a regular extension \tilde u : L_p \to L_p with the same regular norm. This extends a result due to Mireille L\'evy in the case p = 1. Finally, we apply these ideas to the Hardy space H^p viewed as a subspace of L_p on the circle. We show that the space of regular operators from H^p to L_p possesses a similar interpolation property as the spaces R_p defined above.
