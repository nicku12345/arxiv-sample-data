Let E be one of the spaces C(K) and L_1, F be an arbitrary Banach space, p>1, and (X,\sigma) be a space with a finite measure. We prove that E is isometric to a subspace of the Lebesgue-Bochner space L_p(X;F) only if E is isometric to a subspace of F. Moreover, every isometry T from E into L_p(X;F) has the form Te(x)=h(x)U(x)e, e\in E, where h:X\rightarrow R is a measurable function and, for every x\in X, U(x) is an isometry from E to F.
