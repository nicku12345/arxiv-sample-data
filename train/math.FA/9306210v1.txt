A Banach space is c_0-saturated if all of its closed infinite dimensional subspaces contain an isomorph of c_0. In this article, we study the stability of this property under the formation of direct sums and tensor products. Some of the results are: (1) a slightly more general version of the fact that c_0-sums of c_0-saturated spaces are c_0-saturated; (2) C(K,E) is c_0-saturated if both C(K) and E are; (3) the tensor product JH\tilde{\otimes}_\epsilon JH is c_0-saturated, where JH is the James Hagler space.
