For a large class of Banach spaces, a general construction of subspaces without local unconditional structure is presented. As an application it is shown that every Banach space of finite cotype contains either l_2 or a subspace without unconditional basis, which admits a Schauder basis. Some other interesting applications and corollaries follow.
