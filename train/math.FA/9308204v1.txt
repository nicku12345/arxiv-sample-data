In this paper, we study {\it operator spaces\/} in the sense of the theory developed recently by Blecher-Paulsen [BP] and Effros-Ruan [ER1]. By an operator space, we mean a closed subspace E\subset B(H), with H Hilbert.   We will be mainly concerned here with the ``geometry'' of {\it finite dimensional\/} operator spaces. In the Banach space category, it is well known that every separable space embeds isometrically into \ell_\infty. Moreover, if E is a finite dimensional normed space then for each \vp>0, there is an integer n and a subspace F\subset \ell^n_\infty which is (1+\vp)-isomorphic to E, i.e. there is an isomorphism u\colon \ E\to F such that \|u\|\ \|u^{-1}\|\le 1+\vp. Here of course, n depends on \vp, say n=n(\vp) and usually (for instance if E = \ell^k_2) we have n(\vp)\to \infty when \vp\to 0.   Quite interestingly, it turns out that this fact is not valid in the category of operator spaces:\ although every operator space embeds completely isometrically into B(H) (the non-commutative analogue of \ell_\infty) it is not true that a finite dimensional operator space must be close to a subspace of M_n (the non-commutative analogue of \ell^n_\infty) for some n. The main object of this paper is to study this phenomenon.
