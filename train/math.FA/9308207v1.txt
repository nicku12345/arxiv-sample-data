We introduce the notion of a regular mapping on a non-commutative L_p-space associated to a hyperfinite von Neumann algebra for 1\le p\le \infty. This is a non-commutative generalization of the notion of regular or order bounded map on a Banach lattice. This extension is based on our recent paper [P3], where we introduce and study a non-commutative version of vector valued L_p-spaces. In the extreme cases p=1 and p=\infty, our regular operators reduce to the completely bounded ones and the regular norm coincides with the cb-norm. We prove that a mapping is regular iff it is a linear combination of bounded, completely positive mappings. We prove an extension theorem for regular mappings defined on a subspace of a non-commutative L_p-space. Finally, let R_p be the space of all regular mappings on a given non-commutative L_p-space equipped with the regular norm. We prove the isometric identity R_p=(R_\infty,R_1)^\theta where \theta=1/p and where (\ .\ ,\ .\ )^\theta is the dual variant of Calder\'on's complex interpolation method.
