Let E,F be exact operators (For example subspaces of the C^*-algebra K(H) of all the compact operators on an infinite dimensional Hilbert space H). We study a class of bounded linear maps u\colon E\to F^* which we call tracially bounded. In particular, we prove that every completely bounded (in short c.b.) map u\colon E\to F^* factors boundedly through a Hilbert space. This is used to show that the set OS_n of all n-dimensional operator spaces equipped with the c.b. version of the Banach Mazur distance is not separable if n>2.   As an application we show that there is more than one C^*-norm on B(H)\otimes B(H), or equivalently that B(H)\otimes_{\min}B(H)\not=B(H)\otimes_{\max}B(H), which answers a long standing open question.   Finally we show that every ``maximal" operator space (in the sense of Paulsen) is not exact in the infinite dimensional case, and in the finite dimensional case, we give a lower bound for the ``exactness constant".
