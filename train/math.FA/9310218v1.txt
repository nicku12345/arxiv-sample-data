Let X be a separable nonquasireflexive Banach space. Let Y be a Banach space isomorphic to a subspace of X^*. The paper is devoted to the following questions: 1. Under what conditions does there exist an isomorphic embedding T:Y\to X^* such that subspace T(Y)\subset X^* is total? 2. If such embeddings exist, what are the possible orders of T(Y)?   Here we need to recall some definitions. For a subset M\subset X^* we denote the set of all limits of weak^* convergent sequences in M by M_{(1)}. Inductively, for ordinal number \alpha we let M_{(\alpha)}=\cup_{\beta<\alpha}(M_{(\beta)})_{(1)}.   The least ordinal \alpha for which M_{(\alpha)}= M_{(\alpha+1)} is called the {\it order} of M.
