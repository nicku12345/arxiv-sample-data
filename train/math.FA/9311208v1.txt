We present a formula for the Fourier transforms of order statistics in \Bbb R^n showing that all these Fourier transforms are equal up to a constant multiple outside the coordinate planes in \Bbb R^n.   For a_1\geq ... \geq a_n\ge0 and q>0, denote by \ell_{w,q}^n the n-dimensional Lorentz space with the norm \|(x_1,...,x_n)\| = (a_1 (x_1^{*})^q +...+ a_n (x_n^{*})^q)^{1/q}, where (x_1^{*},...,x_n^{*}) is the non-increasing permutation of the numbers |x_1|,...,|x_n|. We use the above mentioned formula and the Fourier transform criterion of isometric embeddability of Banach spaces into L_q \cite{10} to prove that, for n\geq 3 and q\leq 1, the space \ell_{w,q}^n is isometric to a subspace of L_q if and only if the numbers a_1,...,a_n form an arithmetic progression. For q>1, all the numbers a_i must be equal so that \ell_{w,q}^n = \ell_q^n. Consequently, the Lorentz function space L_{w,q}(0,1) is isometric to a subspace of L_q if and only if {\it either} 0<q<\infty and the weight w is a constant function (so that L_{w,q}= L_q), {\it or} q\le 1 and w(t) is a decreasing linear function.   Finally, we relate our results to the theory of positive definite functions.
