Let  n\geq 2, A=(a_{ij})_{i,j=1}^{n} be a real symmetric matrix, a=(a_i)_{i=1}^{n}\in \Bbb R^n. Consider the differential operator D_A = \sum_{i,j=1}^n a_{ij}{\partial^2 \over \partial x_i \partial x_j}+ \sum_{i=1}^n a_i{\partial \over \partial x_i}. Let E be a bounded domain in \Bbb R^n, p>0. Denote by L_{D_A}^p(E) the space of solutions of the equation D_A f=0 in the domain E provided with the L_p-norm.   We prove that, for matrices A,B, vectors a,b, bounded domains E,F, and every p>0 which is not an even integer, the space L_{D_A}^p(E) is isometric to a subspace of L_{D_B}^p(F) if and only if the matrices A and B have equal signatures, and the domains E and F coincide up to a natural mapping which in the most cases is affine.   We use the extension method for L_p-isometries which reduces the problem to the question of which weighted composition operators carry solutions of the equation D_A f=0 in E to solutions of the equation D_B f=0 in F.
