It is well known in Banach space theory that for a finite dimensional space E there exists a constant c_E, such that for all sequences (x_k)_k \subset E one has \[ \summ_k \noo x_k \rrm \kl c_E \pl \sup_{\eps_k \pm 1} \noo \summ_k \eps_k x_k \rrm \pl .\] Moreover, if E is of dimension n the constant c_E ranges between \sqrt{n} and n. This implies that absolute convergence and unconditional convergence only coincide in finite dimensional spaces. We will characterize Banach spaces X, where the constant c_E \sim \sqrt{n} for all finite dimensional subspaces. More generally, we prove that an estimate c_E \kll c n^{1-\frac{1}{q}}holds for all n \in \nz and all n-dimensional subspaces E of X if and only if the eigenvalues of every operator factoring through \ell_{\infty} decrease of order k^{-\frac{1}{q}} if and only if X is of weak cotype q, introduced by Pisier and Mascioni. We emphasize that in contrast to Talagrand's equivalence theorem on cotype q and absolutely (q,1)-summing spaces this extendsto the case q=2. If q>2 and one of the conditions above is satisfied one has \[ \kla \summ_k \noo x_k \rrm^q \mer^{\frac{1}{q}} \kl C^{1+l}\pl (1+{\rm log}_2)^{(l)}((1 +{\rm log}_2 n)^{\frac{1}{q}}) \pl \ez \noo \summ_k \eps_k x_k \rrm \] for all n,l \in \nz and (x_k)_k \subset E, E a n dimensional subspace of X. In the case q=2 the same holds if we replace the expected value by the supremum.
