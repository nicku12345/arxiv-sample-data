A generalization of Lozanovskii's result is proved. Let E be k-dimensional subspace of an n-dimensional Banach space with unconditional basis. Then there exist x_1,..,x_k \subset E such that B_E \p \subset \p absconv\{x_1,..,x_k\} and \[ \kla \frac{{\rm vol}(absconv\{x_1,..,x_k\})}{{\rm vol}(B_E)} \mer^{\frac{1}{k}} \kl \kla e\p \frac{n}{k} \mer^2 \pl .\] This answers a question of V. Milman which appeared during a GAFA seminar talk about the hyperplane problem. We add logarithmical estimates concerning the hyperplane conjecture for proportional subspaces and quotients of Banach spaces with unconditional basis.   File Length:27K
