It is proved that every function of finite Baire index on a separable metric space K is a D-function, i.e., a difference of bounded semi-continuous functions on K. In fact it is a strong D-function, meaning it can be approximated arbitrarily closely in D-norm, by simple D-functions. It is shown that if the n^{th} derived set of K is non-empty for all finite n, there exist D-functions on K which are not strong D-functions. Further structural results for the classes of finite index functions and strong D-functions are also given.
