Let E be a Banach space and, for any positive integer n, let {\cal P}(^nE) denote the Banach space of continuous n-homogeneous polynomials on E. Davie and Gamelin showed that the natural extension mapping from {\cal P}(^nE) to {\cal P}(^nE^{\ast\ast}) is an isometry into the latter space. Here, we investigate when there is a natural isomorphism between {\cal P}(^nE)^{\ast\ast} and {\cal P}(^nE^{\ast\ast}). Among other things, we show that if E satisfies: \break (a) no spreading model built on a normalised weakly null sequence has a lower q-estimate for any q < \infty, (b) E^{\ast} has RNP, and (c) E^{\ast} has the approximation property, then {\cal P}(^nE) has RNP for every n. Moreover, if E satisfies (a) and is such that E^{\ast\ast} has both the RNP and the approximation property, then {\cal P}(^nE)^{\ast\ast} and {\cal P}(^nE^{\ast\ast}) are isomorphic for every n. We also exhibit a quasi-reflexive Banach space E for which {\cal P}(^nE)^{\ast\ast} and {\cal P}(^nE^{\ast\ast}) are isomorphic for every n.   Related work has been done recently by (i) M. Gonzalez, (ii) M. Valdivia, and (iii) J. Jaramillo, A. Prieto, and I. Zalduendo.
