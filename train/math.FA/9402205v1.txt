We examine some structural properties of (injective and projective) tensor products of \ell_p-spaces (projections, complemented subspaces, reflexivity, isomorphisms, etc.). We combine these results with combinatorial arguments to address the question of primarity for these spaces and their duals.   Our main results are: \medbreak \item{(1)} If 1<p<\infty, then B(\ell_p)\approx B(L_p) (B(X) consists of the bounded linear operators on X). \medbreak \item{(2)} If {1\over p_i}+{1\over p_j}\leq1 for every i\neq j, or if all of the p_i's are equal, then \ell_{p_1}\hat{\otimes}\cdots \hat{\otimes}\ell_{p_N} is primary. \medbreak \item{(3)} \ell_p embeds into \ell_{p_1}\hat{\otimes}\cdots \hat{\otimes}\ell_{p_N} if and only if there exists A\subset \{1,2,\cdots,n\} such that {1\over p}=\min\{\sum_{i\in A}{1\over p_i},1\}. \medbreak \item{(4)} If 1\leq p<\infty and m\geq1, then the space of homogeneous analytic polynomials {\cal P}_m(\ell_p) and the symmetric tensor product of m copies of \ell_p are primary.
