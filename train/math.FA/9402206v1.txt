We consider the problem of complex interpolation of certain Hardy-type subspaces of K\"othe function spaces. For example, suppose X_0 and X_1 are K\"othe function spaces on the unit circle \bold T, and let H_{X_0} and H_{X_1} be the corresponding Hardy spaces. Under mild conditions on X_0,X_1 we give a necessary and sufficient condition for the complex interpolation space [H_{X_0},H_{X_1}]_{\theta} to coincide with H_{X_{\theta}} where X_{\theta}=[X_0,X_1]_{\theta}. We develop a very general framework for such results and our methods apply to many more general sitauations including the vector-valued case.
