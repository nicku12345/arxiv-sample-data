In this paper we address some basic questions of the Banach space structure of the nest algebras in the trace class; in particular, we study whether any two of them are isomorphic to each other, and show that the nest algebras in the trace class have bases. We construct three non-isomorphic examples of nest algebras in c_1; present a new proof of the primarity of c_1 (Arazy, [Ar1], [Ar2]), and prove that K(H), and the nest algebras in B(H) are primary.
