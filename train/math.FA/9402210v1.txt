Necessary and sufficient oscillation conditions are given for a weakly convergent sequence (resp. relatively weakly compact set) in the Bochner-Lebesgue space \l1 to be norm convergent (resp. relatively norm compact), thus extending the known results for \rl1. Similarly, necessary and sufficient oscillation conditions are given to pass from weak to limited (and also to Pettis-norm) convergence in \l1. It is shown that tightness is a necessary and sufficient condition to pass from limited to strong convergence. Other implications between several modes of convergence in \l1 are also studied.
