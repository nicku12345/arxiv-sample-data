In this paper we prove that several operator algebras are completely isomorphic to each other; e.g., the C^*_\lambda(F_k), k\geq 2, the C^*-algebras generated by the regular left representation \lambda:F_k\to B(\ell_2(F_k)), are completely isomorphic to each other.   We also study the ``non-commutative'' analytic spaces introduced by G. Popescu [Po], and give applications to Popescu's version of Von Neumann's inequality.
