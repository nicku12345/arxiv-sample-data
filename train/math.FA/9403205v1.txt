In this paper we give the isomorphic classification of atomic H^1(X,d,\mu), where (X,d,\mu) is a space of homogeneous type, hereby completing a line of investigation opened by the work of Bernard Maurey [Ma1], [Ma2], [Ma3] and continued by Lennard Carleson [C] and Przemyslaw Wojtaszczyk [Woj1], [Wpj2].
