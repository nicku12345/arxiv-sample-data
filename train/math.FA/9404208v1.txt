In this article, we characterize the UMD--property of a Banach space X by ideal norms associated with trigonometric orthonormal systems.   The asymptotic behavior of that numerical parameters can be used to decide whether or not X is a UMD--space. Moreover, in the negative case, we obtain a measure that shows how far X is from being a UMD--space.   The main result is, that all described parameters are equivalent also in the quantitative setting.
