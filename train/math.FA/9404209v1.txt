The framework of the paper is that of the full Fock space {\Cal F}^2({\Cal H}_n) and the Banach algebra F^\infty which can be viewed as non-commutative analogues of the Hardy spaces H^2 and H^\infty respectively.   An inner-outer factorization for any element in {\Cal F}^2({\Cal H}_n) as well as characterization of invertible elements in F^\infty are obtained. We also give a complete characterization of invariant subspaces for the left creation operators S_1,\cdots, S_n of {\Cal F}^2({\Cal H}_n). This enables us to show that every weakly (strongly) closed unital subalgebra of \{\varphi(S_1,\cdots,S_n):\varphi\in F^\infty\} is reflexive, extending in this way the classical result of Sarason [S].   Some properties of inner and outer functions and many examples are also considered.
