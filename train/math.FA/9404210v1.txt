As is well known absolute convergence and unconditional convergence for series are equivalent only in finite dimensional Banach spaces. Replacing the classical notion of absolutely summing operators by the notion of 1 summing operators \[ \summ_k || Tx_k || \leq c || \summ_k e_k \otimes x_k ||_{\ell_1\otimes_{min}E}\] in the category of operator spaces, it turns out that there are quite different interesting examples of 1 summing operator spaces. Moreover, the eigenvalues of a composition TS decreases of order n^{\frac{1}{q}} for all operators S factorizing completely through a commutative C^*-algebra if and only if the 1 summing norm of the operator T restricted to a n-dimensional subspace is not larger than c n^{1-\frac{1}{q}}, provided q>2. This notion of 1 summing operators is closely connected to the notion of minimal and maximal operator spaces.
