For each S \in L(E) (with E a Banach space) the operator R(S) \in L(E^{**}/E) is defined by R(S)(x^{**}+E) = S^{**}x^{**}+E \quad (x^{**}\in E^{**}). We study mapping properties of the correspondence S\to R(S), which provides a representation R of the weak Calkin algebra L(E)/W(E) (here W(E) denotes the weakly compact operators on E). Our results display strongly varying behaviour of R. For instance, there are no non--zero compact operators in Im(R) in the case of L^1 and C(0,1), but R(L(E)/W(E)) identifies isometrically with the class of lattice regular operators on \ell^2 for E=\ell^2(J) (here J is the James' space). Accordingly, there is an operator T \in L(\ell^2(J)) such that R(T) is invertible but T fails to be invertible modulo W(\ell^2(J)).
