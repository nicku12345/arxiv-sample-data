For every n\geq 3, we construct an n-dimensional Banach space which is isometric to a subspace of L_{1/2} but is not isometric to a subspace of L_1. The isomorphic version of this problem (posed by S. Kwapien in 1969) is still open. Another example gives a Banach subspace of L_{1/4} which does not embed isometrically in L_{1/2}. Note that, from the isomorphic point of view, all the spaces L_q with q<1 have the same Banach subspaces.
