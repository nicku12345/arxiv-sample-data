The paper is devoted to two particular cases of the following general problem. Let \alpha and \beta be two types of bases in Banach spaces. Let a Banach space X has bases of both types and a subspace M\subset X^* contains the sequence of biorthogonal functionals of some \alpha-basis in X. Does M contain a sequence of biorthogonal functionals of some \beta-basis in X?   The following particular cases are considered:   (\alpha, \beta)=(Schauder bases, unconditional bases),   (\alpha, \beta)=(Nonlinear operational bases, linear operational bases).   The paper contains an investigation of some of the spaces constructed by S.Belle\-not in ``The J-sum of Banach spaces'', J. Funct. Anal. {\bf 48} (1982), 95--106. (These spaces are used in some examples.)
