A Banach space E has the Grothendieck property if every (linear bounded) operator from E into c_0 is weakly compact. It is proved that, for an integer k>1, every k-homogeneous polynomial from E into c_0 is weakly compact if and only if the space {\cal P}(^kE) of scalar valued polynomials on E is reflexive. This is equivalent to the symmetric k-fold projective tensor product of E (i.e., the predual of {\cal P}(^kE)) having the Grothendieck property. The Grothendieck property of the projective tensor product E\widehat{\bigotimes}F is also characterized. Moreover, the Grothendieck property of E is described in terms of sequences of polynomials.   Finally, it is shown that if every operator from E into c_0 is completely continuous, then so is every polynomial between these spaces.
