Letting E, F be Banach spaces, the main two results of this paper are the following: (1) If every (linear bounded) operator E\rightarrow F is unconditionally converging, then every polynomial from E to F is unconditionally converging (definition as in the linear case). (2) If E has the Dunford-Pettis property and every operator E\rightarrow F is weakly compact, then every k-linear mapping from E^k into F takes weak Cauchy sequences into norm convergent sequences. In particular, every polynomial from \ell_\infty into a space containing no copy of \ell_\infty is completely continuous. This solves a problem raised by the authors in a previous paper, where they showed that there exist nonweakly compact polynomials from \ell_\infty into any nonreflexive space.
