Let X be a separable Banach space, Y be a Banach space and \Lambda be a subset of the dual group of a given compact metrizable abelian group. We prove that if X^* and Y have the type I-\Lambda-RNP (resp. type II-\Lambda-RNP) then K(X,Y) has the type I-\Lambda-RNP (resp. type II-\Lambda-RNP) provided L(X,Y)=K(X,Y). Some corollaries are then presented as well as results conserning the separability assumption on X. Similar results for the NearRNP and the WeakRNP are also presented.
