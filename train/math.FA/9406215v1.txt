This is a survey of results on the classification of Banach spaces as metric spaces. It is based on a series of lectures I gave at the Functional Analysis Seminar in 1984-1985, and it appeared in the 1984-1985 issue of the Longhorn Notes. I keep receiving requests for copies, because some of the material here does not appear elsewhere and because the Longhorn Notes are not so easy to get. Having it posted on the Bulletin thus seems reasonable despite the fact that it is not updated, and I thank the Editors of the Longhorn Notes for their permission to do so.
