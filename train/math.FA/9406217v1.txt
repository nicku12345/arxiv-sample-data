Structural properties are given for D(K), the Banach algebra of (complex) differences of bounded semi-continuous functons on a metric space K. For example, it is proved that if all finite derived sets of K are non-empty, then a complex function \varphi operates on D(K) (i.e., \varphi\circ f\in D(K) for all f\in D(K)) if and only if \varphi is locally Lipschitz. Another example: if W\subset K and g\in D(W) is real-valued, then it is proved that g extends to a \tilde g in D(K) with \|\tilde g\|_{D(K)} = \|g\|_{D(W)}. Considerable attention is devoted to SD(K), the closure in D(K) of the set of simple functions in D(K). Thus it is proved that every member of SD(K) is a (complex) difference of semi-continuous functions in SD(K), and that |f| belongs to SD(K) if f does. An intrinsic characterization of SD(K) is given, in terms of transfinite oscillation sets. Using the transfinite oscillations, alternate proofs are given of the results of Chaatit, Mascioni and Rosenthal that functions of finite Baire-index belong to SD(K), and that SD(K)\ne D(K) for interesting K. It is proved that the ``variable oscillation criterion'' characterizes functions belonging to B_{1/4}(K), thus answering an open problem raised in earlier work of Haydon, Odell and Rosenthal. It is also proved that f belongs to B_{1/4}(K) (if and) only if f is a uniform limit of simple D-functions of uniformly bounded D-norm iff \osc_\omega f is bounded; the last equivalence has also been obtained by V.~Farmaki, using other methods.
