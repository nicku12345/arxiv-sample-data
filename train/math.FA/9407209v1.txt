For a certain class of algebras \cal A we give a method for constructing Banach spaces X such that every operator on X is close to an operator in \cal A. This is used to produce spaces with a small amount of structure. We present several applications. Amongst them are constructions of a new prime Banach space, a space isomorphic to its subspaces of codimension two but not to its hyperplanes and a space isomorphic to its cube but not to its square.
