Let X be a Banach space with an unconditional finite-dimensional Schauder decomposition (E_n). We consider the general problem of characterizing conditions under which one can construct an unconditional basis for X by forming an unconditional basis for each E_n. For example, we show that if \sup \dim E_n<\infty and X has Gordon-Lewis local unconditional structure then X has an unconditional basis of this type. We also give an example of a non-Hilbertian space X with the property that whenever Y is a closed subspace of X with a UFDD (E_n) such that \sup\dim E_n<\infty then Y has an unconditional basis, showing that a recent result of Komorowski and Tomczak-Jaegermann cannot be improved.
