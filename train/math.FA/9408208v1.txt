Let \msp be a measure space and let 1 < p < \infty. The {\em weak L^p}\/ space \wlp consists of all measurable functions f such that   \[ \|f\| = \sup_{t>0}t^{\frac{1}{p}}f^*(t) < \infty,\]   where f^* is the decreasing rearrangement of |f|. It is a Banach space under a norm which is equivalent to the expression above. In this paper, we pursue the problem of classifying weak L^p spaces isomorphically when \msp is purely atomic. It is also shown that if \msp is a countably generated \sigma-finite measure space, then \wlp (if infinite dimensional) must be isomorphic to either \ell^\infty or \seq.   The results of this article were presented at the conference in Columbia, Missouri in May, 1994.
