For an arbitrary infinite-dimensional Banach space \X, we construct examples of strongly-measurable \X-valued Pettis integrable functions whose indefinite Pettis integrals are nowhere weakly differentiable; thus, for these functions the Lebesgue Differentiation Theorem fails rather spectacularly. We also relate the degree of nondifferentiability of the indefinite Pettis integral to the cotype of \X, from which it follows that our examples are reasonably sharp.   This is an expanded version of a previously posted paper with the same name.
