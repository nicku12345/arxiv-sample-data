Let X be a Banach space and (f_n)_n be a bounded sequence in L^1(X). We prove a complemented version of the celebrated Talagrand's dichotomy i.e we show that if (e_n)_n denotes the unit vector basis of c_0, there exists a sequence g_n \in \text{conv}(f_n,f_{n+1},\dots) such that for almost every \omega, either the sequence (g_n(\omega) \otimes e_n) is weakly Cauchy in X \widehat{\otimes}_\pi c_0 or it is equivalent to the unit vector basis of \ell^1. We then get a criterion for a bounded sequence to contain a subsequence equivalent to a complemented copy of \ell^1 in L^1(X). As an application, we show that for a Banach space X, the space L^1(X) has Pe\l czy\'nski's property (V^*) if and only if X does.
