Let X be a (real or complex) rearrangement-in\-va\-riant function space on \Om (where \Om = [0,1] or \Om \subseteq \bbN) whose norm is not proportional to the L_2-norm. Let H be a separable Hilbert space. We characterize surjective isometries of X(H). We prove that if T is such an isometry then there exist Borel maps a:\Om\to\bbK and \sigma:\Om\lra\Om and a strongly measurable operator map S of \Om into \calB(H) so that for almost all \om S(\om) is a surjective isometry of H   and for any f\in X(H) Tf(\om)=a(\om)S(\om)(f(\sigma(\om))) \text{ a.e.}   As a consequence we obtain a new proof of characterization of surjective isometries in complex rearrangement-invariant function spaces.
