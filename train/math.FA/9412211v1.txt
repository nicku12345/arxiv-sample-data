Given an operator T:U_X(\Sigma)\to Y or {T:U(\Sigma)\to Y, one may consider the net of conditional expectation operators (T_\pi) directed by refinement of the partitions \pi. It has been shown previously that (T_\pi) does not always converge to T. This paper gives several conditions under which this convergence does occur, including complete characterizations when X={\bold R} or when X\sp * has the Radon-Nikod\'ym property.
