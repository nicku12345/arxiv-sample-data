In this paper, we show that the projective tensor product of a two-dimen\-sional \ell^p space with a two-dimensional \ell^q space never has the Mazur Intersection Property for a large range of values of p and q. For this purpose, we characterise the extreme contractions from \ell^p_2 to \ell^q_2 and obtain their closure.
