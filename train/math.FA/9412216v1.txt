For any complex Banach space X, let J denote the duality mapping of X. For any unit vector x in X and any (C_0) contraction semigroup (T_t)_{t>0} on X, Baillon and Guerre-Delabriere proved that if X is a smooth reflexive Banach space and if there is x^* \in J(x) such that |\langle T(t) \, x,J(x)\rangle| \to 1  as t \to \infty, then there is a unit vector y\in X which is an eigenvector of the generator A of (T_t)_{t>0} associated with a purely imaginary eigenvalue. They asked whether this result is still true if X is replaced by c_o. In this article, we show the answer is negative.
