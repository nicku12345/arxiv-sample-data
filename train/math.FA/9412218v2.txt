We precisely evaluate the operator norm of the uncentered Hardy-Littlewood maximal function on L^p(\Bbb R^1). We also compute the operator norm of the uncentered Hardy-Littlewood maximal function over rectangles on L^p(\Bbb R^n), and we show that the operator norm of the uncentered Hardy-Littlewood maximal function over balls on L^p(\Bbb R^n) grows exponentially with the dimension as n \to \infty.
