K.\ S.\ Lau had shown that a reflexive Banach space has the Mazur Intersection Property (MIP) if and only if every closed bounded convex set is the closed convex hull of its farthest points.   In this work, we show that in general this latter property is equivalent to a property stronger than the MIP. As corollaries, we recapture the result of Lau and characterize the w*-MIP in dual of RNP spaces.
