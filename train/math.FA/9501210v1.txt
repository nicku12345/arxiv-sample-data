The classical Brunn-Minkowski inequality states that for A_1,A_2\subset\R^n compact,  |A_1+A_2|^{1/n}\ge |A_1|^{1/n}+|A_2|^{1/n}\eqno(1)  where |\cdot| denotes the Lebesgue measure on \R^n. In 1986 V. Milman {\bf [Mil 1]} discovered that if B_1 and B_2 are balls there is always a relative position of B_1 and B_2 for which a perturbed inverse of (1) holds. More precisely:\lq\lq{\sl There exists a constant C>0 such that for all n\in\N and any balls B_1,B_2\subset\R^n we can find a linear transformation u\colon\R^n\to\R^n with |{\rm det}(u)|=1 and   |u(B_1)+B_2|^{1/n}\le C(|B_1|^{1/n}+|B_2|^{1/n})"}   The aim of this paper is to extend this Milman's result to a larger class of sets.
