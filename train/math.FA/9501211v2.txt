Let \Sigma be a \sigma-algebra over \Omega, and let M(\Sigma) denote the Banach space of complex measures. Consider a representation T_t for t\in\Bbb R acting on M(\Sigma). We show that under certain, very weak hypotheses, that if for a given \mu \in M(\Sigma) and all A \in \Sigma the map t \mapsto T_t \mu(A) is in H^\infty(\Bbb R), then it follows that the map t \mapsto T_t \mu is Bochner measurable. The proof is based upon the idea of the Analytic Radon Nikod\'ym Property.   Straightforward applications yield a new and simpler proof of Forelli's main result concerning analytic measures ({\it Analytic and quasi-invariant measures}, Acta Math., {\bf 118} (1967), 33--59).
