We prove a number of results concerning the embedding of a Banach lattice X into an r.i. space Y. For example we show that if Y is an r.i. space on [0,\infty) which is p-convex for some p>2 and has nontrivial concavity then any Banach lattice X which is r-convex for some r>2 and embeds into Y must embed as a sublattice. Similar conclusions can be drawn under a variety of hypotheses on Y; if X is an r.i. space on [0,1] one can replace the hypotheses of r-convexity for some r>2 by X\neq L_2.   We also show that if Y is an order-continuous Banach lattice which contains no complemented sublattice lattice-isomorphic to \ell_2, X is an order-continuous Banach lattice so that \ell_2 is not complementably lattice finitely representable in X and X is isomorphic to a complemented subpace of Y then X is isomorphic to a complemented sublattice of Y^N for some integer N.
