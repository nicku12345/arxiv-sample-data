A bounded linear operator between Banach spaces is called {\it completely continuous} if it carries weakly convergent sequences into norm convergent sequences. Isolated is a universal operator for the class of non-completely-continuous operators from L_1 into an arbitrary Banach space, namely, the operator from L_1 into \ell_\infty defined by  T_0 (f) =\left( \int r_n f \, d\mu \right)_{n\ge 0} \ ,  where r_n is the n^{\text{th}} Rademacher function. It is also shown that there does not exist a universal operator for the class of non-completely-continuous operators between two arbitrary Banach space. The proof uses the factorization theorem for weakly compact operators and a Tsirelson-like space.
