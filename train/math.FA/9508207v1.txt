The concept of Rademacher type p (1\leq p\leq2) plays an important role in the local theory of Banach spaces. In \cite{mas88} Mascioni considers a weakening of this concept and shows that for a Banach space X weak Rademacher type p implies Rademacher type r for all r<p.   As with Rademacher type p and weak Rademacher type p, we introduce the concept of Haar type p and weak Haar type p by replacing the Rademacher functions by the Haar functions in the respective definitions. We show that weak Haar type p implies Haar type r for all r<p. This solves a problem left open by Pisier \cite{pis75}.   The method is to compare Haar type ideal norms related to different index sets.
