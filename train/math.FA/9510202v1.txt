In this work, we introduce a new Asymptotic Norming Property (ANP) which lies between the strongest and weakest of the existing ones, and obtain isometric characterisations of it. The corresponding w*-ANP turns out to be equivalent on the one hand, to Property (V) introduced by Sullivan, and to a ball separation property on the other. We also study stability properties of this new ANP and its w*-version.
