Let X be a Banach space and (\Omega,\Sigma) be a measure space. We provide a characterization of sequences in the space of X-valued countably additive measures on \Omega,\Sigma) of bounded variation that generate complemented copies of \ell_1. As application, we prove that if a dual Banach space E^* has Pe\l czy\'nski's property (V*) then so does the space of E^*-valued countably additive measures with bounded variation. Another application, we show that for a Banach space X, the space \ell_\infty(X) contains a complemented copy of \ell_1 if and only if X contains all \ell_1^n uniformly complemented.
