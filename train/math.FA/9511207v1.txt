Let E be a Banach space that does not contain any copy of \ell^1 and \A be a non commutative C^*-algebra. We prove that every absolutely summing operator from \A into E^* is compact, thus answering a question of Pe\l czynski.   As application, we show that if G is a compact metrizable abelian group and \Lambda is a Riesz subset of its dual then every countably additive \A^*-valued measure with bounded variation and whose Fourier transform is supported by \Lambda has relatively compact range. Extensions of the same result to symmetric spaces of measurable operators are also presented.
