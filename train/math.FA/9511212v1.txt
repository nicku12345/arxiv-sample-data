We describe the complete interpolating sequences for the Paley-Wiener spaces L^p_\pi (1<p<\infty) in terms of Muckenhoupt's (A_p) condition. For p=2, this description coincides with those given by Pavlov (1979), Nikol'skii (1980), and Minkin (1992) of the unconditional bases of complex exponentials in L^2(-\pi,\pi). While the techniques of these authors are linked to the Hilbert space geometry of L^2_\pi, our method of proof is based on turning the problem into one about boundedness of the Hilbert transform in certain weighted L^p spaces of functions and sequences.
