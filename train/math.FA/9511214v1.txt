Let \A be the operator which assigns to each m \times n matrix-valued function on the unit circle with entries in H^\infty + C its unique superoptimal approximant in the space of bounded analytic m \times n matrix-valued functions in the open unit disc. We study the continuity of \A with respect to various norms. Our main result is that, for a class of norms satifying certain natural axioms, \A is continuous at any function whose superoptimal singular values are non-zero and is such that certain associated integer indices are equal to 1. We also obtain necessary conditions for continuity of \A at point and a sufficient condition for the continuity of superoptimal singular values.
