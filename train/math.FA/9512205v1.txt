Recently, E.\ Kirchberg [K1--2] revived the study of pairs of C^*-algebras A,B such that there is only one C^*-norm on the algebraic tensor product A\otimes B, or equivalently such that A \otimes_{\rm min}B = A\otimes_{\rm max}B. Recall that a C^*-algebra is called nuclear cf.\ [L, EL] if this happens for any C^*-algebra B. Kirchberg [K1] constructed the first example of a non-nuclear C^*-algebra such that A\otimes_{\rm min} A^{op} = A \otimes_{\rm max} A^{op}. He also proved the following striking result [K2] for which we give a very simple proof and which we extend.   \proclaim Theorem 0.1. {\bf (Kirchberg [K2]).} Let F be any free group and let C^*(F) be the (full) C^*-algebra of F, then C^*(F) \otimes_{\rm min} B(H) = C^*(F) \otimes_{\rm max} B(H).
