For a function \varphi in L^2(0,1), extended to the whole real line as an odd periodic function of period 2, we ask when the collection of dilates \varphi(nx), n=1,2,3,\ldots, constitutes a Riesz basis or a complete sequence in L^2(0,1). The problem translates into a question concerning multipliers and cyclic vectors in the Hilbert space \cal H of Dirichlet series f(s)=\sum_n a_nn^{-s}, where the coefficients a_n are square summable. It proves useful to model \cal H as the H^2 space of the infinite-dimensional polydisk, or, which is the same, the H^2 space of the character space, where a character is a multiplicative homomorphism from the positive integers to the unit circle. For given f in \cal H and characters \chi, f_\chi(s)=\sum_na_n\chi(n)n^{-s} is a vertical limit function of f. We study certain probabilistic properties of these vertical limit functions.
