In this paper we show that the theory of Hankel operators in the torus \T^d, for d > 1, presents striking differences with that on the circle \T, starting with bounded Hankel operators with no bounded symbols. Such differences are circumvented here by replacing the space of symbols L^\infty (\T) by BMOr(\T^d), a subspace of product BMO, and the singular numbers of Hankel operators by so-called sigma numbers. This leads to versions of the Nehari--AAK and Kronecker theorems, and provides conditions for the existence of solutions of product Pick problems through finite Pick-type matrices. We give geometric and duality characterizations of BMOr, and of a subspace of it, bmo, closely linked with A_2 weights. This completes some aspects of the theory of BMO in product spaces.
