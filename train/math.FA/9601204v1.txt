A Banach space X is said to be Q.H.I. if eve\-ry infinite dimensional quo\-tient spa\-ce of X is H.I.: that is, a space is Q.H.I. if the H.I. property is not only stable passing to subspaces, but also passing to quotients and to the dual. We show that Gowers-Maurey's space is Q.H.I.; then we provide an example of a reflexive H.I. space {\cal X} whose dual is not H.I., from which it follows that \cal X is not Q.H.I.
