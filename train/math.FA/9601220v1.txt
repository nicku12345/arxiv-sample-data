Let A_tf(x)=\int f(x+ty)d\sigma(y) denote the spherical means in \Bbb R^d (d\sigma is surface measure on S^{d-1}, normalized to 1). We prove sharp estimates for the maximal function M_E f(x)=\sup_{t\in E}|A_tf(x)| where E is a fixed set in \Bbb R^+ and f is a {\it radial} function \in L^p(\Bbb R^d). Let p_d=d/(d-1) (the critical exponent of Stein's maximal function). For the cases (i) p<p_d, d\ge 2 and (ii) p=p_d, d\ge 3, and for p\le q\le\infty we prove necessary and sufficient conditions for L^p\to L^{p,q} boundedness of the operator M_E.
