Let \eps >0. We prove that there exists an operator T_\eps:\ell_2\to\ell_2, such that for any polynomial P we have \|{P(T)}\| \leq(1+\eps)\|{P}\|_\infty, but which is not similar to a contraction, {\it i.e.} there does not exist an invertible operator S:\ \ell_2\to\ell_2 such that \|{S^{-1}T_\eps S}\|\leq 1. This answers negatively a question attributed to Halmos after his well known 1970 paper (``Ten problems in Hilbert space").
