A sequence \{f_n\} of strongly-measurable functions taking values in a Banach space \X is scalarly null a\.e\. (resp. scalarly null in measure) if x^*f_n \rightarrow0 a\.e\. (resp. x^*f_n \rightarrow 0 in measure) for every x^*\in \X^*. Let 1\le p\le \infty. The main questions addressed in this paper are whether an L_p(\X)-bounded sequence that is scalarly null a\.e\. will converge weakly a\.e\. (or have a subsequence which converges weakly a\.e\.), and whether an L_p(\X)-bounded sequence that is scalarly null in measure will have a subsequence that is scalarly null a\.e. The answers to these and other similar questions depend upon p and upon the geometry of \X.
