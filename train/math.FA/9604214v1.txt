Two methods of constructing infinitely many isomorphically distinct \Cal L_p-spaces have been published. In this article we show that these constructions yield very different spaces and in the process develop methods for dealing with these spaces from the isomorphic viewpoint. We use these methods to give a complete isomorphic classification of the spaces R_p^\alpha constructed by Bourgain, Rosenthal, and Schechtman and to show that X_p\otimes X_p is not isomorphic to a complemented subspace of any R_p^\alpha.
