Any regular mixed Tsirelson space T(\theta_n,S_n)_{\N} for which \frac{\theta_n}{\theta^n} \to 0, where \theta=\lim_n \theta_n^{1/n}, is shown to be arbitrarily distortable. Certain asymptotic \ell_1 constants for those and other mixed Tsirelson spaces are calculated. Also a combinatorial result on the Schreier families (S_{\alpha})_{\alpha < \omega_1} is proved and an application is given to show that for every Banach space X with a basis (e_i), the two \Delta-spectrums \Delta(X) and \Delta(X,(e_i)) coincide.
