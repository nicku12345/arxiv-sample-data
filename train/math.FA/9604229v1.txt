We analyze the stability of Muckenhoupt's \RHp and \Ap classes of weights under a nonlinear operation, the \lb-operation. We prove that the dyadic doubling reverse H\"older classes \RHp are not preserved under the \lb-operation, but the dyadic doubling A_p classes \Ap are preserved for 0<\lb <1. We give an application to the structure of resolvent sets of dyadic paraproduct operators.
