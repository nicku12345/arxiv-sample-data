We introduce a natural class of functions, the {\em pseudomultipliers}, associated with a general Hilbert function space, prove an extension theorem which justifies the definition, give numerous examples and establish the nature of the 1-pseudomultipliers of Hilbert spaces of analytic functions under mild hypotheses.
