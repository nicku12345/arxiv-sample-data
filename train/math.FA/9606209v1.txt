A well known argument of James yields that if a Banach space X contains \ell_1^n's uniformly then X contains \ell_1^n's almost isometrically. In the first half of the paper we extend this idea to the ordinal \ell_1-indices of Bourgain. In the second half we use our results to calculate the \ell_1-index of certain Banach spaces. Furthermore we show that the \ell_1-index of a separable Banach space not containing \ell_1 must be of the form \omega^{\alpha} for some countable ordinal \alpha.
