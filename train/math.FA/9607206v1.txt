We study certain twisted sums of Orlicz spaces with non-trivial type which can be viewed as Fenchel-Orlicz spaces on {\rm {\bf R}}^2. We then show that a large class of Fenchel-Orlicz spaces on {\rm {\bf R}}^n can be renormed to have property (M). In particular this gives a new construction of the twisted Hilbert space Z_2 and shows it has property (M), after an appropriate renorming.
