It is proved that if a Banach space X has a basis (e_n) satisfying every spreading model of a normalized block basis of (e_n) is 1-equivalent to the unit vector basis of \ell_1 (respectively, c_0) then X contains \ell_1 (respectively, c_0). Furthermore Tsirelson's space T is shown to have the property that every infinite dimensional subspace contains a sequence having spreading model 1-equivalent to the unit vector basis of \ell_1. An equivalent norm is constructed on T so that \|s_1+s_2\|<2 whenever (s_n) is a spreading model of a normalized basic sequence in T.
