Let \msp be a purely non-atomic measure space, and let 1 < p < \infty. If \weakLp\msp is isomorphic, as a Banach space, to \weakLp\mspp for some purely atomic measure space \mspp, then there is a measurable partition \Omega = \Omega_1\cup\Omega_2 such that (\Omega_1,\Sigma\cap\Omega_1,\mu_{|\Sigma\cap\Omega_1}) is countably generated and \sigma-finite, and that \mu(\sigma) = 0 or \infty for every measurable \sigma \subseteq \Omega_2. In particular, \weakLp\msp is isomorphic to \ell^{p,\infty}.
