We define embedding of an n-dimensional normed space into L_{-p},\ 0<p<n by extending analytically with respect to p the corresponding property of the classical L_p-spaces. The well-known connection between embeddings into L_p and positive definite functions is extended to the case of negative p by showing that a normed space embeds in L_{-p} if and only if \|x\|^{-p} is a positive definite distribution. Using this criterion, we generalize the recent solutions to the 1938 Schoenberg's problems by proving that the spaces \ell_q^n,\ 2<q\le \infty embed in L_{-p} if and only if p\in [n-3,n). We show that the technique of embedding in L_{-p} can be applied to stable processes in some situations where standard methods do not work. As an example, we prove inequalities of correlation type for the expectations of norms of stable vectors. In particular, for every p\in [n-3,n), \Bbb E(\max_{i=1,...,n} |X_i|^{-p}) \ge \Bbb E(\max_{i=1,...,n} |Y_i|^{-p}), where X_1,...,X_n and Y_1,...,Y_n are jointly q-stable symmetric random variables, 0<q\le 2, so that, for some k\in \Bbb N,\ 1\le k <n, the vectors (X_1,...,X_k) and (X_{k+1},...,X_n) have the same distributions as (Y_1,...,Y_k) and (Y_{k+1},...,Y_n), respectively, but Y_i and Y_j are independent for every choice of 1\le i\le k,\ k+1\le j\le n.
