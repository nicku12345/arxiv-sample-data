A basic sequence in a Banach space is called wide-(s) if it is bounded and dominates the summing basis. (Wide-(s) sequences were originally introduced by I.~Singer, who termed them P^*-sequences). These sequences and their quantified versions, termed \lambda-wide-(s) sequences, are used to characterize various classes of operators between Banach spaces, such as the weakly compact, Tauberian, and super-Tauberian operators, as well as a new intermediate class introduced here, the strongly Tauberian operators. This is a nonlocalizable class which nevertheless forms an open semigroup and is closed under natural operations such as taking double adjoints. It is proved for example that an operator is non-weakly compact iff for every \varepsilon >0, it maps some (1+\varepsilon)-wide-(s)-sequence to a wide-(s) sequence. This yields the quantitative triangular arrays result characterizing reflexivity, due to R.C.~James. It is shown that an operator is non-Tauberian (resp. non-strongly Tauberian) iff for every \varepsilon>0, it maps some (1+\varepsilon)-wide-(s) sequence into a norm-convergent sequence (resp. a sequence whose image has diameter less than \varepsilon). This is applied to obtain a direct ``finite'' characterization of super-Tauberian operators, as well as the following characterization, which strengthens a recent result of M.~Gonz\'alez and A.~Mart{\'\i}nez-Abej\'on: An operator is non-super-Tauberian iff there are for every \varepsilon>0, finite (1+\varepsilon)-wide-(s) sequences of arbitrary length whose images have norm at most \varepsilon.
