We prove a general result on complemented unconditional basic sequences in Banach lattices and apply it to give some new examples of spaces with unique unconditional basis. We show that Tsirelson space and certain Nakano spaces have the unique unconditional bases. We also construct an example of a space with a unique unconditional basis with a complemented subspace failing to have a unique unconditional basis.
