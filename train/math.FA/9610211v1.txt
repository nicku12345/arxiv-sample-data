If Q is a surjection from L^1(\mu), \mu \sigma-finite, onto a Banach space containing c_0 then (*) \ker Q is uncomplemented in its second dual. If Q is a surjection from an {\cal L}_1-space onto a Banach space containing uniformly \ell_n^\infty (n=1,2,\dots) then (**) there exists a bounded linear operator from \ker Q into a Hilbert space which is not 2-absolutely summing. Let S be an infinite Sidon set in the dual group \Gamma of a compact abelian group G. Then L^1_{\tilde{S}}(G)=\{f\in L^1(G): \hat{f}(\gamma)=0 for \gamma\in S\} satisfies (*) and (**) hence L^1_{\tilde{S}}(G) is not an {\cal L}_1-space and is not isomorphic to a Banach lattice.
