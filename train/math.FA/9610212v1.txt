Let \Ps(\N) be the set of all finite subsets of \N, endowed with the product topology. A description of the compact subsets of \Ps(\N) is given. Two applications of this result to Banach space theory are shown : (1) a characterization of the symmetric sequence spaces which embed into C(\om^\om), and (2) a characterization, in terms of the Orlicz function M, of the Orlicz sequence spaces h_M which embed into C(K) for some countable compact Hausdorff space K.
