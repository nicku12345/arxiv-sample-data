It is shown that if \alpha ,\zeta  are ordinals such that 1\leq \zeta <\alpha <\zeta \omega , then there is an operator from C(\omega ^{\omega ^\alpha }) onto itself such that if Y is a subspace of C(\omega ^{\omega ^\alpha }) which is isomorphic to C(\omega ^{\omega ^\alpha }) , then the operator is not an isomorphism on Y. This contrasts with a result of J. Bourgain that implies that there are uncountably many ordinals \alpha  for which any operator from C(\omega ^{\omega ^\alpha }) onto itself there is a subspace of C(\omega ^{\omega ^\alpha }) which is isomorphic to % C(\omega ^{\omega ^\alpha }) on which the operator is an isomorphism.
