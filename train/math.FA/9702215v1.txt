Let M be a von Neumann algebra with a faithful normal finite trace t, and H^\infty be a finite, maximal, subdiagonal of M. Fundamental theorems on conjugate functions for weak* Dirichlet algebras are shown to be a bounded linear map from L^p(M,t) into L^p(M,t) for 1<p<\infty, and to be a continuous linear map from L^1(M,t) into L^{1,\infty}(M,t). We also obtain that if a positive operator a is such that a\log^{+}a \in L^1(M,t), then its conjugate belongs to L^1(M,t).
