Let A be a C^*-algebra. It is shown that every absolutely summing operator from A into \ell_2 factors through a Hilbert space operator that belongs to the 4-Schatten- von Neumann class. We also provide finite dimensinal examples that show that one can not improve the 4-Schatten-von Neumann class to p-Schatten von Neumann class for any p<4. As application, we prove that there exists a modulus of capacity \epsilon \to N(\epsilon) so that if A is a C^*-algebra and T \in \Pi_1(A,\ell_2) with \pi_1(T)\leq 1, then for every \epsilon >0, the \epsilon-capacity of the image of the unit ball of A under T does not exceed N(\epsilon). This aswers positively a question raised by Pe\l czynski.
