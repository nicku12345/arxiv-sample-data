In analogy with the maximal tensor product of C^*-algebras, we define the ``maximal" tensor product E_1\otimes_\mu E_2 of two operator spaces E_1 and E_2 and we show that it can be identified completely isometrically with the sum of the two Haagerup tensor products: \ E_1\otimes_h E_2 + E_2\otimes_h E_1. Let E be an n-dimensional operator space. As an application, we show that the equality E^* \otimes_\mu E=E^* \otimes_{\rm min} E holds isometrically iff E = R_n or E=C_n (the row or column n-dimensional Hilbert spaces). Moreover, we show that if an operator space E is such that, for any operator space F, we have F\otimes_{\min} E=F\otimes_{\mu} E isomorphically, then E is completely isomorphic to either a row or a column Hilbert space.
