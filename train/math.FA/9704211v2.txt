The best constant in the usual Lp norm inequality for the centered Hardy-Littlewood maximal function on R1 is obtained for the class of all ``peak-shaped'' functions. A positive function on the line is called ``peak-shaped'' if it is positive and convex except at one point. The techniques we use include convexity and an adaptation of the standard Euler-Langrange variational method.
