For an asymptotic \ell_1 space X with a basis (x_i) certain asymptotic \ell_1 constants, \delta_\alpha (X) are defined for \alpha <\omega_1. \delta_\alpha (X) measures the equivalence between all normalized block bases (y_i)_{i=1}^k of (x_i) which are S_\alpha-admissible with respect to (x_i) (S_\alpha is the \alpha^{th}-Schreier class of sets) and the unit vector basis of \ell_1^k. This leads to the concept of the delta spectrum of X, \Delta (X), which reflects the behavior of stabilized limits of \delta_\alpha (X). The analogues of these constants under all renormings of X are also defined and studied. We investigate \Delta (X) both in general and for spaces of bounded distortion. We also prove several results on distorting the classical Tsirelson's space T and its relatives.
