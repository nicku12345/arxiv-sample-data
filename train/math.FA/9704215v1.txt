We study the modified and boundedly modified mixed Tsirelson spaces T_M[({\cal F}_{k_n},\theta_n)_{n=1}^{\infty }] and T_{M(s)}[({\cal F}_{k_n},\theta_n)_{n=1}^{\infty }] respectively, defined by a subsequence ({\cal F}_{k_n}) of the sequence of Schreier families ({\cal F}_n). These are reflexive asymptotic \ell_1 spaces with an unconditio- nal basis (e_i)_i having the property that every sequence \{ x_i\}_{i=1}^n of normalized disjointly supported vectors contained in \langle e_i\rangle_{i=n}^{\infty } is equivalent to the basis of \ell_1^n. We show that if \lim\theta_n^{1/n}=1 then the space T[({\cal F}_n,\theta_n) _{n=1}^{\infty }] and its modified variations are totally incomparable by proving that c_0 is finitely disjointly representable in every block subspace of T[({\cal F}_n, \theta_n)_{n=1}^{\infty }]. Next, we present an example of a boundedly modified mixed Tsirelson space X_{M(1),u} which is arbitrarily distortable. Finally, we construct a variation of the space X_{M(1),u} which is hereditarily indecomposable.
