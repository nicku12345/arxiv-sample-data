We prove that in the setting of operator spaces the result of Davis, Figiel, Johnson and Pelczynski on factoring weakly compact operators holds accordingly. Though not related directly to the main theorem we add a remark on the description of weakly compact subsets in the dual of noncommutative vector valued {\rm L}_1.
