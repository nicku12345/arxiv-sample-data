Let A be a unital operator algebra. Let us assume that every {\it bounded\/} unital homomorphism u\colon \ A\to B(H) is similar to a {\it contractive\/} one. Let \text{\rm Sim}(u) = \inf\{\|S\|\, \|S^{-1}\|\} where the infimum runs over all invertible operators S\colon \ H\to H such that the ``conjugate'' homomorphism a\to S^{-1}u(a)S is contractive. Now for all c>1, let \Phi(c) = \sup\text{\rm Sim}(u) where the supremum runs over all unital homomorphism u\colon\ A\to B(H) with \|u\|\le c. Then, there is \alpha\ge 0 such that for some constant K we have: \Phi(c) \le Kc^\alpha.\leqno (*)\qquad \forall c>1 Moreover, the smallest \alpha for which this holds is an integer, denoted by d(A) (called the similarity degree of A) and (*) still holds for some K when \alpha=d(A). Among the applications of these results, we give new characterizations of proper uniform algebras on one hand, and of nuclear C^*-algebras on the other. Moreover, we obtain a characterization of amenable groups which answers (at least partially) a question on group representations going back to a 1950 paper of Dixmier.
