We present here a new method for approximating functions defined on superreflexive Banach spaces by differentiable functions with \alpha-H\"older derivatives (for some 0<\alpha\leq 1). The smooth approximation is given by means of an explicit formula enjoying good properties from the minimization point of view. For instance, for any function f which is bounded below and uniformly continuous on bounded sets this formula gives a sequence of \Delta-convex {\Cal{C}}^{1,\alpha} functions converging uniformly on bounded sets to f and preserving the infimum and the set of minimizers of f. The techniques we develop are based on the use of {\sl extended inf-convolution} formulas and convexity properties such as the preservation of smoothness for the convex envelope of certain differentiable functions.
