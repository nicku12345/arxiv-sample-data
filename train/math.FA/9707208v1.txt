The aim of this paper is to solve a linear preserver problem on the function algebra C(X). We show that in case X is a first countable compact Hausdorff space, every linear bijection \phi:C(X)\to C(X) having the property that diam(\phi(f)(X))=diam(f(X)) (f\in C(X)) is of the form \[ \phi(f)=\tau \cdot f\circ \varphi +t(f)1 \qquad (f\in C(X)) \] where \tau is a complex number of modulus 1, \varphi:X\to X is a homeomorphism and t is a linear functional on C(X).
