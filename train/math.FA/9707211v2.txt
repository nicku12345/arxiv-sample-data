We investigate several aspects of almost 1-unconditionality. We characterize the metric unconditional approximation property UMAP in terms of ``block unconditionality''. Then we focus on translation invariant subspaces L^p_E(T) and C_E(T) of functions on the circle and express block unconditionality as arithmetical conditions on E. Our work shows that the spaces L^p_E(T), p an even integer, have a singular behaviour from the almost isometric point of view: property UMAP does not interpolate between spaces L^p_E(T) and L^{p+2}_E(T). These arithmetical conditions are used to construct counterexamples for several natural questions and to investigate the maximal density of such sets E. We also prove that if E=\{n_k\}_{k\ge1} with |n_{k+1}/n_k|\to\infty, then C_E(T) has UMAP and we get a sharp estimate of the Sidon constant of Hadamard sets. Finally, we investigate the relationship of metric unconditionality and probability theory.
