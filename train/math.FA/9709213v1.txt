General results of interpolation (eg. Nevanlinna-Pick) by elements in the noncommutative analytic Toeplitz algebra F^\infty (resp. noncommutative disc algebra A_n) with consequences to the interpolation by bounded operator-valued analytic functions in the unit ball of {\bf C}^n are obtained.   Non-commutative Poisson transforms are used to provide new von Neumann type inequalities. Completely isometric representations of the quotient algebra F^\infty/J on Hilbert spaces, where J is any w^*-closed, 2-sided ideal of F^\infty, are obtained and used to construct a w^*-continuous, F^\infty/J--functional calculus associated to row contractions T=[T_1,\dots, T_n] when f(T_1,\dots,T_n)=0 for any f\in J. Other properties of the dual algebra F^\infty/J are considered.
