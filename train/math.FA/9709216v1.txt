A Banach space X is said to have the Daugavet property if every operator T: X\to X of rank~1 satisfies \|Id+T\| = 1+\|T\|. We show that then every weakly compact operator satisfies this equation as well and that X contains a copy of \ell_{1}. However, X need not contain a copy of L_{1}. We also study pairs of spaces X\subset Y and operators T: X\to Y satisfying \|J+T\|=1+\|T\|, where J: X\to Y is the natural embedding. This leads to the result that a Banach space with the Daugavet property does not embed into a space with an unconditional basis. In another direction, we investigate spaces where the set of operators with \|Id+T\|=1+\|T\| is as small as possible and give characterisations in terms of a smoothness condition.
