It is shown that a separable Banach space X can be given an equivalent norm |\!|\!|\cdot |\!|\!| with the following properties:\quad If (x_n)\subseteq X is relatively weakly compact and \lim_{m\to\infty} \lim_{n\to\infty}\break |\!|\!| x_m + x_n |\!|\!| = 2\lim_{m\to\infty} |\!|\!| x_m|\!|\!| then (x_n) converges in norm. This yields a characterization of reflexivity once proposed by V.D.~Milman. In addition it is shown that some spreading model of a sequence in (X, |\!|\!|\cdot |\!|\!|) is 1-equivalent to the unit vector basis of \ell_1 (respectively, c_0) implies that X contains an isomorph of \ell_1 (respectively, c_0).
