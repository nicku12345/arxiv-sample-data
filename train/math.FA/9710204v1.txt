A Banach space X is superreflexive if each Banach space Y that is finitely representable in X is reflexive. Superreflexivity is known to be equivalent to J-convexity and to the non-existence of uniformly bounded factorizations of the summation operators S_n through X. We give a quantitative formulation of this equivalence. This can in particular be used to find a factorization of S_n through X, given a factorization of S_N through [L_2,X], where N is `large' compared to n.
