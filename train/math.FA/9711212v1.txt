We consider singular integrals associated to a classical Calder\'on-Zygmund kernel K and a hypersurface given by the graph of \varphi(\psi(t)) where \varphi is an arbitrary C^1 function and \psi is a smooth convex function of finite type. We give a characterization of those Calder\'on-Zygmund kernels K and convex functions \psi so that the associated singular integral operator is bounded on L^2 for all C^1 functions \varphi.
