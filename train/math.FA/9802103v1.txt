We consider operator-valued Herglotz functions and their applications to self-adjoint perturbations of self-adjoint operators and self-adjoint extensions of densely defined closed symmetric operators. Our applications include model operators for both situations, linear fractional transformations for Herglotz operators, results on Friedrichs and Krein extensions, and realization theorems for classes of Herglotz operators. Moreover, we study the concrete case of Schr\"odinger operators on a half-line and provide two illustrations of Livsic's result [44] on quasi-hermitian extensions in the special case of densely defined symmetric operators with deficiency indices (1,1).
