Absolutely representing system (ARS) in a Banach space X is a set D \subset X such that every vector x in X admits a representation by an absolutely convergent series x = \sum_i a_i x_i with (a_i) reals and (x_i) \subset D. We investigate some general properties of ARS. In particular, ARS in uniformly smooth and in B-convex Banach spaces are characterized via \epsilon-nets of the unit balls. Every ARS in a B-convex Banach space is quick, i.e. in the representation above one can achieve \|a_i x_i\| < cq^i\|x\|, i=1,2,... for some constants c>0 and q \in (0,1).
