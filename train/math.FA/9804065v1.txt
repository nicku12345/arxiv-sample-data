We show that the classification problem for genus n Banach spaces can be reduced to the unconditionally primary case and that the critical case there is n=2. It is further shown that a genus n Banach space is unconditionally primary if and only if it contains a complemented subspace of genus (n-1). We begin the process of classifying the genus 2 spaces by showing they have a strong decomposition property.
