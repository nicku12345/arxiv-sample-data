It is proved that a discrete group G is amenable if and only if for every unitary representation of G in an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space \cal H the maximal uniform compactification of the unit sphere \s_{\cal H} has a G-fixed point, that is, the pair (\s_{\cal H},G) has the concentration property in the sense of Milman. Consequently, the maximal U({\cal H})-equivariant compactification of the sphere in a Hilbert space \cal H has no fixed points, which answers a 1987 question by Milman.   This is a version as of November 19, 1998, incorporating some revisions.
