Let A be a unital Banach function algebra with character space \Phi_A. For x\in \Phi_A, let M_x and J_x be the ideals of functions vanishing at x, and in a neighbourhood of x, respectively. It is shown that the hull of J_x is connected, and that if x does not belong to the Shilov boundary of A then the set \{y\in\Phi_A: M_x\supseteq J_y\} has an infinite, connected subset. Various related results are given.
