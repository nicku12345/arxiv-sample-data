We develope a local theory for frames on finite dimensional Hilbert spaces. In particular, a bounded frame on a finite dimensional Hilbert space contains a subset which is a good Riesz basis for a percentage (arbitrarily close to one) of the space. We also construct a normalized frame for a Hilbert space which contains a subset which is a Schauder basis for H but does not contain any subset which is a Riesz basis for H.
