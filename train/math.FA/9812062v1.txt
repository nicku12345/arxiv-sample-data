We show that injective isometries in Orlicz space L_M have to preserve disjointness, provided that Orlicz function M satisfies \Delta_2-condition, has a continuous second derivative M'', satisfies another ``smoothness type'' condition and either   \lim_{t\to0} M''(t) = \infty or M''(0) = 0 and M''(t)>0 for all t>0. The fact that surjective isometries of any rearrangement-invariant function space have to preserve disjointness has been determined before. However dropping the assumption of surjectivity invalidates the general method. In this paper we use a differential technique.
