In this paper we first show that if X is a Banach space and \alpha is a left invariant crossnorm on \ell_\infty\otimes X, then there is a Banach lattice L and an isometric embedding J of X into L, so that I\otimes J becomes an isometry of \ell_\infty\otimes_\alpha X onto \ell_\infty\otimes_m J(X). Here I denotes the identity operator on \ell_\infty and \ell_\infty\otimes_m J(X) the canonical lattice tensor product. This result is originally due to G. Pisier (unpublished), but our proof is different. We then use this to characterize the Gordon-Lewis property \GL in terms of embeddings into Banach lattices. Also other structures related to the \GL are investigated.
