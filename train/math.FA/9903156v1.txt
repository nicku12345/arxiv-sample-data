This article contains the results of two types. First we give a complete characterization of band preserving projection operators on Dedekind complete vector lattices. This is done in Theorem~3.4. Let us mention also Theorem~3.2 that contains a description of such operators on arbitrary laterally complete vector lattices. The central role in these descriptions is played by d-bases, one of two principal tools utilized in our work [{\it Inverses of Disjointness Preserving Operators}, Memoirs of the Amer. Math. Soc., forthcoming]. The concept of a d-basis has been applied so far only to vector lattices with a large amount of projection bands. The absence of the projection bands has been the major obstacle for extending, otherwise very useful concept of d-bases, to arbitrary vector lattices. In Section~4 we overcome this obstacle by finding a new way to introduce d-independence in an arbitrary vector lattice. This allows us to produce a new definition of a d-basis which is free of the existence of projection bands. We illustrate this by proving several results devoted to cardinality of d-bases. Theorems~4.13 and~4.15 are the main of them and they assert that, under very general conditions, a vector lattice either has a singleton d-basis of else this d-basis must be infinite.
