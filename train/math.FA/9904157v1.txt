We prove an abstract interpolation theorem which interpolates the (r,2)-summing and (s,2)-mixing norm of a fixed operator in the image and the range space. Combined with interpolation formulas for spaces of operators we obtain as an application the original Bennett-Carl inequalities for identities acting between Minkowski spaces l_u as well as their analogues for Schatten classes S_u. Furthermore, our techniques motivate a study of Bennett-Carl inequalities within a more general setting of symmetric Banach sequence spaces and unitary ideals.
