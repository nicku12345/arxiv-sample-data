Suppose that \lambda - T is left-invertible in L(H) for all \lambda \in \Omega, where \Omega is an open subset of the complex plane. Then an operator-valued function L(\lambda) is a left resolvent of T in \Omega if and only if T has an extension \tilde{T}, the resolvent of which is a dilation of L(\lambda) of a particular form. Generalized resolvents exist on every open set U, with \bar{U} included in the regular domain of T. This implies a formula for the maximal radius of regularity of T in terms of the spectral radius of its generalized inverses. A solution to an open problem raised by J. Zem\'anek is obtained.
