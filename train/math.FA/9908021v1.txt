Let U be an operator in a Hilbert space \mathcal{H}_{0}, and let \mathcal{K}\subset\mathcal{H}_{0} be a closed and invariant subspace. Suppose there is a period-2 unitary operator J in \mathcal{H}_{0} such that JUJ=U^*, and PJP \geq 0, where P denotes the projection of \mathcal{H}_{0} onto \mathcal{K}. We show that there is then a Hilbert space \mathcal{H}(\mathcal{K}), a contractive operator W:\mathcal{K}\to\mathcal{H}(\mathcal{K}), and a selfadjoint operator S=S(U) in \mathcal{H}(\mathcal{K}) such that W^*W=PJP, W has dense range, and SW=WUP. Moreover, given (\mathcal{K},J) with the stated properties, the system (\mathcal{H}(\mathcal{K}),W,S) is unique up to unitary equivalence, and subject to the three conditions in the conclusion. We also provide an operator-theoretic model of this structure where U|_{\mathcal{K}} is a pure shift of infinite multiplicity, and where we show that \ker(W)=0. For that case, we describe the spectrum of the selfadjoint operator S(U) in terms of structural properties of U. In the model, U will be realized as a unitary scaling operator of the form f(x)\mapsto f(cx), c>1, and the spectrum of S(U_{c}) is then computed in terms of the given number c.
