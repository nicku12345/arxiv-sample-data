We study the spaces of Poisson, compound Poisson and Gamma noises as special cases of a general approach to non-Gaussian white noise calculus, see \cite{KSS96}. We use a known unitary isomorphism between Poisson and compound Poisson spaces in order to transport analytic structures from Poisson space to compound Poisson space. Finally we study a Fock type structure of chaos decomposition on Gamma space.
