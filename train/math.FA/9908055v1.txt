In this paper we extend the result obtained in \cite{AKR97} (see also \cite {AKR96}) on the representation of the intrinsic pre- Dirichlet form \mathcal{E}_{\pi_{\sigma}}^{\Gamma} of the Poisson measure \pi_{\sigma} in terms of the extrinsic one \mathcal{E}_{\pi_{\sigma},H_{\sigma}^{X}}^{P}. More precisely, replacing \pi_{\sigma} by a Gibbs measure \mu on the configuration space \Gamma_{X} we derive a relation between the intrinsic pre-Dirichlet form \mathcal{E}_{\mu}^{\Gamma} of the measure \mu and the extrinsic one \mathcal{E}_{\mu, H_{\sigma}^{X}}^{P}. As a consequence we prove the closability of \mathcal{E}_{\mu}^{\Gamma} on L^{2}(\Gamma_{X},\mu) under very general assumptions on the interaction potential of the Gibbs measures \mu.
