In this paper we carry out analysis and geometry for a class of infinite dimensional manifolds, namely, compound configuration spaces as a natural generalization of the work \cite{AKR97}. More precisely a differential geometry is constructed on the compound configuration space \Omega_{X} over a Riemannian manifold X. This geometry is obtained as a natural lifting of the Riemannian structure on X. In particular, the intrinsic gradient, divergence, and Laplace-Beltrami operator are constructed. Therefore the corresponding Dirichlet forms on L^{2}(\Omega_{X}) can be defined. Each is shown to be associated with a diffusion process on \Omega_{X} (so called equilibrium process) which is nothing but the diffusion process on the simple configuration space \Gamma_{X} together with corresponding marks. As another consequence of our results we obtain a representation of the Lie-algebra of compactly supported vector fields on X on compound Poisson space. Finally generalizations to the case when the compound Poisson measure is replaced by a marked Poisson measure easily follow from this construction.
