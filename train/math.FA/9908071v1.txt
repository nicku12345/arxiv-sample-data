We introduce the concept of a direct C_{\omega}^{\ast}-system and show that every non-separable unital C^{\ast}-algebra is the limit of essentially unique direct C_{\omega}^{\ast}-system. This result is then applied to the problem of characterization of projective unital C^{\ast}-algebras. It is shown that a non-separable unital C^{\ast}-algebra X of density \tau is projective if and only if it is the limit of a well ordered direct system {\mathcal S}_{X} = \{X_{\alpha}, i_{\alpha}^{\alpha +1}, \alpha < \tau \} of length \tau, consisting of unital projective C^{\ast}-subalgebras X_{\alpha} of X and doubly projective homomorphisms (inclusions) i_{\alpha}^{\alpha +1} \colon X_{\alpha} \to X_{\alpha +1}, \alpha < \tau, so that X_{0} is separable and each i_{\alpha}^{\alpha +1}, \alpha < \tau, has a separable type. In addition we show that a doubly projective homomorphism f \colon X \to Y of unital projective C^{\ast}-algebras has a separable type if and only if there exists a pushout diagram \[ \begin{CD} X @>f>> Y @A{p}AA @AA{q}A X_{0} @>f_{0}>> Y_{0}, \end{CD} \]   \noindent where X_{0} and Y_{0} are separable unital projective C^{\ast}-algebras and the homomorphisms i_{0} \colon X_{0} \to Y_{0}, p \colon X_{0} \to X and q \colon Y_{0} \to Y are doubly projective. These two results provide a complete characterization of non-separable projective unital C^{\ast}-algebras in terms of separable ones.
