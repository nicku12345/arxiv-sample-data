The Maurey-Rosenthal theorem states that each bounded and linear operator T from a quasi normed space E into some L_p(\nu) which satisfies a certain vector-valued inequality even allows a weighted norm inequality. Continuing the work of Garcia Cuerva and Rubio de Francia we give several scalar and vector-valued variants of this fundamental result within the framework of quasi K"othe function spaces over measure spaces.
