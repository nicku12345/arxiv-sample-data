An examination of the translation invariance of V_0 under dyadic rationals is presented, generating a new equivalence relation on the collection of wavelets. The equivalence classes under this relation are completely characterized in terms of the support of the Fourier transform of the wavelet. Using operator interpolation, it is shown that several equivalence classes are non-empty.
