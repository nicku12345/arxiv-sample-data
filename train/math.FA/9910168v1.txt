Thye theory of frames for a Hilbert space plays a fundamental role in signal processing, image processing, data compression, sampling theory and much more, as well as being a fruitful area of research in abstract mathematics. In this ``tutorial'' on abstract frame theory, we will try to point out the major directions of research in abstract frame theory and give some sample techniques from each of the areas. We will also bring out some of the important open questions, discuss some of the limitations of the existing theory, and point to some new directions for research.
