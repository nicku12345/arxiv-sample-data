The following dichotomy is established for a normalized weakly null sequence in a Banach space: Either every subsequence admits a convex block subsequence equivalent to the unit vector basis of c, the Banach space of null sequences under the supremum norm, or there exists a subsequence which is boundedly convexly complete. This result generalizes J. Elton's dichotomy on weakly null sequences.
