We provide a detailed development of a function valued inner product known as the bracket product and used effectively by de Boor,   Devore, Ron and Shen to study translation invariant systems. We develop a version of the bracket product specifically geared to   Weyl-Heisenberg frames. This bracket product has all the properties of a standard inner product including Bessel's inequality, a Riesz Representation Theorem, and a Gram-Schmidt process which turns a sequence of functions (g_{n}) into a sequence (e_{n}) with the property that (E_{mb}e_{n})_{m,n\in \Bbb Z} is orthonormal in L^{2}(\Bbb R). Armed with this inner product, we obtain several results concerning Weyl-Heisenberg frames. First we see that fiberization in this setting takes on a particularly simple form and we use it to obtain a compressed representation of the frame operator. Next, we write down explicitly all those functions g\in   L^{2}(\Bbb R) and ab=1 so that the family (E_{mb}T_{na}g) is complete in L^{2}(\Bbb R). One consequence of this is that for functions g supported on a half-line [{\alpha},\infty) (in particular, for compactly supported g), (g,1,1) is complete if and only if \text{sup}_{0\le t< a}|g(t-n)|\not= 0 a.e. Finally, we give a direct proof of a result hidden in the literature by proving: For any g\in L^{2}(\Bbb R), A\le \sum_{n}   |g(t-na)|^{2}\le B is equivalent to (E_{m/a}g) being a Riesz basic sequence.
