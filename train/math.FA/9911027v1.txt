In 1990, Daubechies proved a fundamental identity for Weyl-Heisenberg systems which is now called the Weyl-Heisenberg Frame Identity. WH-Frame Identity: If g\in W(L^{\infty},L^{1}), then for all continuous, compactly supported functions f we have: \[\sum_{m,n}|<f,E_{mb}T_{na}g>|^{2} = \frac{1}{b}\sum_{k}\int_{\Bbb R}\bar{f(t)}f(t-k/b)\sum_{n} g(t-na)\bar{g(t-na-k/b)} dt.\] It has been folklore that the identity will not hold universally. We make a detailed study of the WH-Frame Identity and show: (1) The identity does not require any assumptions on ab (such as the requirement that ab\le 1 to have a frame); (2) As stated above, the identity holds for all f\in L^{2}(\Bbb R); (3) The identity holds for all bounded, compactly supported functions if and only if g\in L^{2}(\Bbb R); (4) The identity holds for all compactly supported functions if and only if \sum_{n}|g(x-na)|^{2}\le B a.e.; Moreover, in (2)-(4) above, the series on the right converges unconditionally; (5) In general, there are WH-frames and functions f\in L^{2}(\Bbb R) so that the series on the right does not converge (even symmetrically). We give necessary and sufficient conditions for it to converge symmetrically; (6) There are WH-frames for which the series on the right always converges symmetrically to give the WH-Frame Identity, but there are functions for which the series does not converge and we classify when the series converges for all functions f\in \L; (7) There are WH-frames for which the series always converges, but it does not converge unconditionally for some functions, and we classify when we have unconditional convergence for all functions f; and (8) We show that the series converges unconditionally for all f\in L^{2}(\Bbb R) if g satisfies the CC-condition.
