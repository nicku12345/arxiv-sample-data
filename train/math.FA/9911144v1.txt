Johnson and Zippin recently showed that if X is a weak^*-closed subspace of \ell_1 and T:X-> C(K) is any bounded operator then T can extended to a bounded operator \tilde T:\ell_1\to C(K). We give a converse result: if X is a subspace of \ell_1 so that \ell_1/X has a (UFDD) and every operator T:X -> C(K) can be extended to \ell_1 then there is an automorphism \tau of \ell_1 so that \tau(X) is weak^*-closed. This result is proved by studying subspaces of c_0 and several different characterizations of such subspaces are given.
