Let  \Omega \subset R^d  have finite positive Lebesgue measure, and let  \mathcal{L}^{2}(\Omega)  be the corresponding Hilbert space of  \mathcal{L}^{2} -functions on  \Omega . We shall consider the exponential functions  e_{\lambda}  on  \Omega  given by  e_{\lambda}(x)=e^{i2\pi\lambda x} . If these functions form an orthogonal basis for  \mathcal{L}^{2}(\Omega) , when  \lambda  ranges over some subset  \Lambda  in  R^d , then we say that  (\Omega,\Lambda)  is a spectral pair, and that  \Lambda  is a spectrum. We conjecture that  (\Omega,\Lambda)  is a spectral pair if and only if the translates of some set  \Omega'  by the vectors of  \Lambda  tile  R^d . In the special case of  \Omega=I^d , the  d -dimensional unit cube, we prove this conjecture, with  \Omega'=I^d , for  d \leq 3 , describing all the tilings by  I^d , and for all  d  when  \Lambda  is a discrete periodic set. In an appendix we generalize the notion of spectral pair to measures on a locally compact abelian group and its dual.
