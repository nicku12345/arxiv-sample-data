This paper is devoted to an approximation problem for operators in Hilbert space, that appears when one tries to study geometrically the cascade algorithm in wavelet theory. Let  H  be a Hilbert space, and let  \pi  be a representation of  L^\infty(T)  on  H . Let  R  be a positive operator in  L^\infty(T)  such that  R(1)=1 , where  1  denotes the constant function  1 . We study operators  M  on  H  (bounded, but non-contractive) such that  \pi(f)M=M\pi(f(z^2))  and  M^* \pi(f)M=\pi(R^* f) ,  f \in L^\infty (T) , where the  *  refers to Hilbert space adjoint. We give a complete orthogonal expansion of  H  which reduces  \pi  such that  M  acts as a shift on one part, and the residual part is  H^{(\infty)}=\bigcap_n[M^n H] , where  [M^n H]  is the closure of the range of  M^n . The shift part is present, we show, if and only if  \ker(M^*) \neq \{0\} . We apply the operator-theoretic results to the refinement operator (or cascade algorithm) from wavelet theory. Using the representation  \pi , we show that, for this wavelet operator  M , the components in the decomposition are unitarily, and canonically, equivalent to spaces  L^2(E_n) \subset L^2(R) , where  E_n \subset R ,  n=0,1,2,...,\infty , are measurable subsets which form a tiling of  R ; i.e., the union is  R  up to zero measure, and pairwise intersections of different  E_n 's have measure zero. We prove two results on the convergence of the cascade algorithm, and identify singular vectors for the starting point of the algorithm.
