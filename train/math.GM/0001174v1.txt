The roots of any polynomial of degree m with complex integer coefficients can be computed by manipulation of sequences made from distinct symbols and counting the different symbols in the sequences. This method requires only primitive operations like replacement of sequences and counting of symbols. No calculations using advanced operations like multiplication, division, logarithms etc. are needed. The method can be implemented as a geometric construction using only a ruler and a compass.
