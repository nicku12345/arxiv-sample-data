A systematic algorithm for building integrating factors of the form mu(x,y), mu(x,y') or mu(y,y') for second order ODEs is presented. The algorithm can determine the existence and explicit form of the integrating factors themselves without solving any differential equations, except for a linear ODE in one subcase of the mu(x,y) problem. Examples of ODEs not having point symmetries are shown to be solvable using this algorithm. The scheme was implemented in Maple, in the framework of the "ODEtools" package and its ODE-solver. A comparison between this implementation and other computer algebra ODE-solvers in tackling non-linear examples from Kamke's book is shown.
