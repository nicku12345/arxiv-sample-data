The motivation behind this note, is due to the non success in finding the complete solution to the General Quintic Equation. The hope was to have a solution with all the parameters precisely calculated in a straight forward manner. This paper gives the closed form solution for the five roots of the General Quintic Equation. They can be generated on Maple V, or on the new version Maple VI. On the new version of maple, Maple VI, it may be possible to insert all the substitutions calculated in this paper, into one another, and construct one large equation for the Tschirnhausian Transformation. The solution also uses the Generalized Hypergeometric Function which Maple V can calculate, robustly.
