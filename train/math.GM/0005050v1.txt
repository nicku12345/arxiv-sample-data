An origin is often an intriguing issue. It becomes doubly intriguing when the logical form of thinking is considered. In this paper we will investigate exactly that: we will conjecture on the origin of basic instruments of logical thinking.   As the starting point we consider a very general case of a subject interacting with an environment. The subject might often have a choice of actions to take. Additionally, it is of fundamental importance that as a rule the subject's internal representations of (beliefs about) the environment are inaccurate.   Beginning with this very general schema we will eventually arrive at a possible mechanism of how Logic could have emerged. Our reasoning will be supported with some in-depth case studies.
