It is shown that application of dynamic flows concept in 4-dimensional Euclidean space makes possible to form Minkowski space and to formulate the generalized variational problem of electrodynamics and gravi- dynamics. It is shown that 1-dimensional (cylindrical) factorization of 4-dimensional Euclidean space provides a quantization of ths model.
