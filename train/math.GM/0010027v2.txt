An approximate formula for the partitions of Goldbach's Conjecture is derived using Prime Number Theorem and a heuristic probabilistic approach. A strong form of Goldbach's conjecture follows in the form of a lower bounding function for the partitions of Goldbach's conjecture. Numerical computations suggest that the lower and upper bounding functions for the partitions satisfy a simple functional equation. Assuming that this invariant scaling property holds for all even integer n, the lower and upper bounds can be expressed as simple exponentials.
