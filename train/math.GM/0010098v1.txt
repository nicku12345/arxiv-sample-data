In this article one investigates Rugina's Orientation Table and one gives particular examples for several of its seven models. Leon Walras's Economics of Stable Equilibrium and Keynes's Economics of Disequilibrium are combined in Rugina's Orientation Table in systems which are s% stable and 100-s% unstable, where s may be 100, 95, 65, 50, 35, 5, and 0. The Classical Logic and Modern Logic are united in Rugina's Integrated Logic, and then generalized in the Neutrosophic Logic.
