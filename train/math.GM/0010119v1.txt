The goal of this paper is to experiment new math concepts and theories, especially if they run counter to the classical ones. To prove that contradiction is not a catastrophe, and to learn to handle it in an (un)usual way. To transform the apparently unscientific ideas into scientific ones, and to develop their study (The Theory of Imperfections). And finally, to interconnect opposite (and not only) human fields of knowledge into as-heterogeneous-as-possible other fields.
