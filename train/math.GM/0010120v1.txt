Classes of linguistic paradoxes and linguistic tautologies are introduced with examples and explanations. They are part of the author's work on the Paradoxist Philosophy based on mathematical logic.   The general cases exposed below are modeled on the English language structure in a rigid way. In order to find nice particular examples of such paradoxes and tautologies one grammatically adjusts the sentences.
