The present work includes some of the author's original researches on integer solutions of Diophantine liner equations and systems. The notion of "general integer solution" of a Diophantine linear equation with two unknowns is extended to Diophantine linear equations with n unknowns and then to Diophantine linear systems. The proprieties of the general integer solution are determined (both for a Diophantine linear equation and for a Diophantine linear system). Seven original integer algorithms (two for Diophantine linear equations, and five for Diophantine linear systems) are exposed. The algorithms are strictly proved and an example for each of them is given. These algorithms can be easily implemented on the computer.
