In this paper a small survey is presented on fourteen sequences, such as: G Add-on Sequences, Sieve Sequences, Digital Sequences, Non-Arithmetic Progressions, recreational sequences (Lucky Method/Operation/Algorithm/Differentiation/Integration etc.), General Periodical Sequences, and numerical functions.
