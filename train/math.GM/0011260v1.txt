G. Moreno's abstract depiction of the Sedenions' normed zero-divisors, as homomorphic to the exceptional Lie group G2, is fleshed out by exploring further structures the A-D-E approach of Lie algebraic taxonomy keeps hidden. A breakdown of table equivalence among the half a trillion multiplication schemes the Sedenions allow is found; the 168 elements of PSL(2,7), defining the finite projective triangle on which the Octonions' 480 equivalent multiplication tables are frequently deployed, are shown to give the exact count of primitive unit zero-divisors in the Sedenions. (Composite zero-divisors, comprising all points of certain hyperplanes of up to 4 dimensions, are also determined.) The 168 are arranged in point-set quartets along the 42 Assessors (pairs of diagonals in planes spanned by pure imaginaries, each of which zero-divides only one such diagonal of any partner Assessor). These quartets are multiplicatively organized in systems of mutually zero-dividing trios of Assessors, a D4-suggestive 28 in number, obeying the 6-cycle crossover logic of trefoils or triple zigzags. 3 trefoils and 1 zigzag determine an octahedral vertex structure we call a box-kite -- seven of which serve to partition Sedenion space. By sequential execution of proof-driven production rules, a complete interconnected box-kite system, or Seinfeld production (German for field of being; American for 1990's television's Show About Nothing), can be unfolded from an arbitrary Octonion and any (save for two) of the Sedenions. Indications for extending the results to higher dimensions and different dynamic contexts are given in the final pages.
