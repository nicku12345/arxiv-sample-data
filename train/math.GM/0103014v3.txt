The finite ring Z_k = Z(+,.) mod p^k of residue arithmetic with odd prime power modulus is analysed. The cyclic group of units G_k in Z_k(.) has order (p-1)p^{k-1}, implying product structure G_k = A_k B_k. Here core A_k of order p-1 is an extension for k >1 of Fermat's Small Theorem (FST*), where n^p == n (mod p^k) for each core residue, while extension subgroup B_k has order p^{k-1}. It is shown that each subgroup S >1 of core A_k has zero sum, and that p+1 generates subgroup B_k of all n == 1 (mod p) in G_k. The p-th power residues n^p mod p^k in G_k form an order |G_k|/p subgroup F_k, with |F_k|/|A_k| = p^{k-2}, so F_k properly contains core A_k for k >2. By quadratic analysis (mod p^3) rather than linear analysis (mod p^2, re Hensel's lemma [5]), the additive structure of subgroups G_k and F_k is derived. ... Successor function S(n)=n+1 combines with the two arithmetic symmetries -n (complement) and 1/n (inverse) to yield the "triplet structure" of G_k : three inverse pairs {n_i, 1/(n_i)} with (n_i)+1 = - 1/n_{i+1} (mod p^k), with indices mod 3, and product n_0.n_1.n_2 = 1 mod p^k. In case n_0 = n_1 = n_2 = n this reduces to the cubic root solution n+1 = -(1/n) = -(n^2) (mod p^k, p=1 mod 6). The property "EDS" of exponent p distributing over a sum of core residues: (x+y)^p == x+y == x^p + y^p (mod p^k), is employed to derive the known FLT inequality for integers. In other words, to any FLT(mod p^k) equivalence for k digits correspond p-th power integers of pk digits, and the (p-1)k "carries" make the difference, representing the sum of mixed-terms in the binomial expansion.
