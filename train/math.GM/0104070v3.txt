Stochastic antiderivational equations on Banach spaces over local non-Archimedean fields are investigated. Theorems about existence and uniqiuness of the solutions are proved under definite conditions. In particular Wiener processes are considered in relation with the non-Archimedean analog of the Gaussian measure.
