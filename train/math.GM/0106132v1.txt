Stochastic processes on totally disconnected topological groups are investigated. In particular they are considered for diffeomorphism groups and loop groups of manifolds on non-Archimedean Banach spaces. Theorems about a quasi-invariance and a pseudo-differentiability of transition measures are proved. Transition measures are used for the construction of strongly continuous representations including irreducible of these groups. In addition stochastic processes on general Banach-Lie groups, loop monoids, loop spaces and path spaces of manifolds on Banach spaces over non-Archimedean local fields also are investigated.
