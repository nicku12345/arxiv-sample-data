Quasi-invariant and pseudo-differentiable measures on a Banach space X over a non-Archimedean locally compact infinite field with a non-trivial valuation are defined and constructed. Measures are considered with values in non-Archimedean fields, for example, the field \bf Q_p of p- adic numbers. Theorems and criteria are formulated and proved about quasi-invariance and pseudo-differentiability of measures relative to linear and non-linear operators on X. Characteristic functionals of measures are studied. Moreover, the non-Archimedean analogs of the Bochner-Kolmogorov and Minlos-Sazonov theorems are investigated. Infinite products of measures are considered and the analog of the Kakutani theorem is proved. Convergence of quasi-invariant and pseudo-differentiable measures in the corresponding spaces of measures is investigated.
