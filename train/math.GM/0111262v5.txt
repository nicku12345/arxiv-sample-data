A strategy for proving Riemann hypothesis is suggested. The vanishing of the Rieman Zeta reduces to an orthogonality condition for the eigenfunctions of a non-Hermitian operator D^+ having the zeros of Riemann Zeta as its eigenvalues. The construction of D^+ is inspired by the conviction that Riemann Zeta is associated with a physical system allowing conformal transformations as its symmetries. The eigenfunctions of D^+ are analogous to the so called coherent states and in general not orthogonal to each other. The states orthogonal to a vacuum state (which has a negative norm squared) correspond to the zeros of the Riemann Zeta. The induced metric in the space {\cal{V}} of states which correspond to the zeros of the Riemann Zeta at the critical line Re[s]=1/2 is hermitian and both hermiticity and positive definiteness properties imply Riemann hypothesis. Conformal invariance in the sense of gauge invariance allows only the states belonging to {\cal{V}}. Riemann hypothesis follows also from a restricted form of a dynamical conformal invariance in {\cal{V}} and one can reduce the proof to a standard analytic argument used in Lie group theory.
