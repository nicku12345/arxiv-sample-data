The infinite numbers of the set M of finite and infinite natural numbers are defined starting from the sequence 0\Phi, where 0 is the first natural number, \Phi is a succession of symbols S and xS is the successor of the natural number x. The concept of limit of the natural number n, when n tends to infinite, is examined. Definitions and theorems about operations with elements of M, equivalence and equality of natural numbers, distance between elements of M and the order of the elements are presented.
