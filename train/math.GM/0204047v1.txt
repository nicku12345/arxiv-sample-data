In this article we study manifolds with C^{0}-metrics and properties of Lorentzian multiply warped products. We represent the interior Schwarzschild space-time as a multiply warped product space-time with warping functions and we also investigate the curvature of a multiply warped product with C^0-warping functions. We given the {\it{Ricci curvature}} in terms of f_1, f_2 for the multiply warped products of the form M=(0,\ 2m)\times_{f_1}R^1\times_{f_2} S^2.
