In the paper the foundation of the k-orbit theory is developed. The theory opens a new simple way to the investigation of groups and multidimensional symmetries.   The relations between combinatorial symmetry properties of a k-orbit and its automorphism group are found. It is found the local property of a k-orbit. The difference between 2-closed group and m-closed group for m>2 is discovered. It is explained the specific property of Petersen graph automorphism group n-orbit. It is shown that any non-trivial primitive group contains a transitive imprimitive subgroup and as a result it is proved that the automorphism group of a vertex transitive graph (2-closed group) contains a regular element (polycirculant conjecture).   Using methods of the k-orbit theory, it is considered different possibilities of permutation representation of a finite group and shown that the most informative, relative to describing of the structure of a finite group, is the permutation representation of the lowest degree. Using this representation it is obtained a simple proof of the W. Feit, J.G. Thompson theorem: Solvability of groups of odd order. It is described the enough simple structure of lowest degree representation of finite groups and found a way to constructing of the simple full invariant of a finite group.   To the end, using methods of k-orbit theory, it is obtained one of possible polynomial solutions of the graph isomorphism problem.
