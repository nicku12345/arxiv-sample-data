After certain subsets of Natural numbers called Range and Row are defined, we assume (1) there is a function that can produce prime numbers and (2) each even number greater than 2, like A, can be represented as the sum of n prime numbers. We show this by DC(A)less than or equal to n. Each Row is similar to each other in properties,(so is each Range). It is proven that in an arbitrary Row for any even number greater than 2, DC(A)=2, that is to say, each prime number greater than two is the sum of two prime numbers. So Goldbach's conjecture is proved.
