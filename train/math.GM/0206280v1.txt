038<p type="texpara" tag="Body Text" >The identification theory and realization of the dynamic systems is a medullary aspect in the modern control theory that consists fundamentally in that, starting from the knowledge of the behavior entrance-exit, obtained experimentally in the case of the identification, or given previously in the case of the realization, to build a state model that carries out this behavior. This content is not generally treated in the pre-graduate courses, for the systems of multiple entrances and multiple exits.   038<p type="texpara" tag="Body Text" >In this work it is demonstrated that the identification theory and realization of the lineal dynamic systems can be imparted in the technical careers starting from the results of Mathematical Analysis and Lineal Algebra received by the students in pre-graduate studies, without necessity of adding new contents in the programs of this subjects   038<p type="texpara" tag="Body Text" >.   038<p type="texpara" tag="Body Text" >We propose a new form of imparting the theory of identification and realization of the lineal dynamic systems based on the intuition and the physical interpretation of the concepts.
