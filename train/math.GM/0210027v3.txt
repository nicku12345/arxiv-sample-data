The BMV conjecture for traces, which states that Tr exp(A -\lambda B) is the Laplace transform of a positive measure, is shown to be equivalent to two other statements: (i) The polynomial \lambda\mapsto Tr(A+\lambda B)^p has only non-negative coefficients for all A, B \geq 0, p\in N and (ii) \lambda\mapsto \Tr (A+\lambda B)^{-p} is the Laplace transform of a positive measure for A, B \geq 0, p>0.
