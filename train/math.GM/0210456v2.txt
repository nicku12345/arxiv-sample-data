In 1995, David Chalmers opined as implausible that there may be parts of our arithmetical competence that no sound formal system could ever duplicate. We prove that the recursive number-theoretic relation x=Sb(y 19|Z(y)) - which is algorithmically verifiable since Goedel's recursive function Sb(y 19|Z(y)) is Turing-computable - cannot be "duplicated" in any consistent formal system of Arithmetic.
