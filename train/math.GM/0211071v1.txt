We introduce the scale calculus, which generalizes the classical differential calculus to non differentiable functions. The new derivative is called the scale difference operator. We also introduce the notions of fractal functions, minimal resolution, and quantum representation of a non differentiable function. We then define a scale quantization procedure for classical Lagrangian systems inspired by the Scale relativity theory developped by Nottale. We prove that the scale quantization of Newtionian mechanics is a non linear Schrodinger equation. Under some specific assumptions, we obtain the classical linear Schrodinger equation.
