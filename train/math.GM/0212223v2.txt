In this paper we develop with considerable details a theory of multivector functions of a p-vector variable. The concepts of limit, continuity and differentiability are rigorously studied. Several important types of derivatives for these multivector functions are introduced, as e.g., the A% -directional derivative (where A is a p-vector) and the generalized concepts of curl, divergence and gradient. The derivation rules for different types of products of multivector functions and for compositon of multivector functions are proved.
