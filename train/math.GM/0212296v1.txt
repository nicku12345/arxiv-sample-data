Stochastic processes on manifolds over non-Archimedean fields and with transition measures having values in the field \bf C of complex numbers are defined and investigated. The analogs of Markov, Poisson and Wiener processes are studied. For Poisson processes the non-Archimedean analog of the L\`evy theorem is proved. Stochastic antiderivational equations as well as pseudodifferential equations on manifolds are investigated.
