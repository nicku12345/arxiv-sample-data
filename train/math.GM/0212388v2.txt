If we assume the Thesis that any classical Turing machine T, which halts on every n-ary sequence of natural numbers as input, determines a PA-provable formula, whose standard interpretation is an n-ary arithmetical relation f(x1, >..., xn) that holds if, and only if, T halts, then standard PA can model the state of a deterministic universe that is consistent with a probabilistic Quantum Theory. Another significant consequence of this Thesis is that every partial recursive function can be effectively defined as total.
