Whatever other beliefs there may remain for considering Cantor's diagonal argument as mathematically legitimate, there are three that, prima facie, lend it an illusory legitimacy; they need to be explicitly discounted appropriately.   The first, Cantor's diagonal argument defines a non-countable Dedekind real number; the second, Goedel uses the argument to define a formally undecidable, but interpretively true, proposition; and the third, Turing uses the argument to define an uncomputable Dedekind real number.
