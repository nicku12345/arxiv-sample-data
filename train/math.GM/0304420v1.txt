Generally, in any human field, a Smarandache Structure on a set A means a weak structure W on A such that there exists a proper subset B contained in A which is embedded with a stronger structure S. These types of structures occur in our everyday life, that's why we study them in this book. Thus, as a particular case: A Smarandache semigroup is a semigroup A which has a proper subset B contained in A that is a group (with respect to the same binary operation on A).
