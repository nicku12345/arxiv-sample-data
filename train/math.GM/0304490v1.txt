Generally, in any human field, a Smarandache Structure on a set A means a weak structure W on A such that there exists a proper subset B contained in A which is embedded with a stronger structure S.   These types of structures occurin our everyday'slife, that's why we study them in this book.   Thus, as a particular case: A Smarandache groupoid is a groupoid G which has a proper subset S contained in G such that S under the operation of G is a semigroup.
