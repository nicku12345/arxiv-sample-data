In a forthcoming book, professional computer scientist and physicist Paul Budnik presents an exposition of classical mathematical theory as the backdrop to an elegant thesis: we can interpret any model of a formal system of Peano Arithmetic in an appropriate, digital, computational language. In this paper we attempt - without addressing the question of whether or not Budnik succeeds in establishing his thesis convincingly - to identify dogmas of standard interpretations of classical mathematical theory that appear to be implicit in Budnik's exposition, and to correspond to them dogmas of a constructive interpretation of classical theory.
