We argue that, although Wittgenstein's reservations on Goedel's interpretation of his own formal reasoning are, indeed, of historical importance, the uneasiness that academicians and philosophers continue to sense, and express, over standard interpretations of Goedel's formal reasoning - even seventy years after the publication of his seminal 1931 paper - is of much greater significance, and relevance, to us today.
