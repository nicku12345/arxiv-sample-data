This article demonstrates the invalidity of Theorem VI of Godel's monograph of 1931, showing that propositions (15) and (16), derived from definition (8.1), in its proof, are false in PA. This is achieved in two steps.   First, the predicate complementary to the well-known Godel's predicate Bew(x) is ndefined by adding a new relation Wid(x), and new logical connections are accordingly established, Lemma (6).   Second, the negations of (15) and (16) are derived by definition (8.1) and Lemma (6). It amounts to saying that (15) and (16) are false and unacceptable for the system. On the account of that, the two well-known cases 1. 17 Gen r is not k-PROVABLE, 2. Neg(17 Gen r) is not k-PROVABLE, can not be drawn, and Theorem VI is therefore invalid.
