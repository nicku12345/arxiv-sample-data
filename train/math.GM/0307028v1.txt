Generally, in any human field, a Smarandache Structure on a set A means a weak structure W on A such that there exists a proper subset B which is embedded with a stronger structure S. By proper subset one understands a set included in A, different from the empty set, from the unit element if any, and from A.   These types of structures occur in our everyday's life, thats why we study them in this book.   As an example: A non-empty set L is said to form a loop, if on L is defined a binary operation called product, denoted by '.' such that: for all a, b belonging to L we have a . b belonging to L (closure property); there exists an element e belonging to L such that a . e = e . a = a for all a belonging to L (e is the identity element of L); for every ordered pair (a, b) belonging to L x L there exists a unique pair (p, q) in L such that ap = b and qa = b.   Whence: A Smarandache Loop (or S-Loop) is a loop L such that a proper subset M of L is a subgroup (with respect to the same induced operation).
