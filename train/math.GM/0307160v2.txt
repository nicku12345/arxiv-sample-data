Starting from the Euler's identity, the author improved Riemann's results, discovered the relationship between the Riemann Zeta function and the prime function, and obtained two new corollaries based on Riemann hypothesis is tenable. From these corollaries, the author found the relationship between the p_m, its subscript m and the t_m, and obtains a complete table of primes (less than 5000).
