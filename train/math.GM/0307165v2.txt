Complexified spacetime algebra is defined as the geometric (Clifford) algebra of spacetime with complex coefficients, isomorphic \mathcal{G}_{1,4}. By resorting to matrix representation by means of Dirac-Pauli gamma matrices, the paper demonstrates isomorphism between subgroups of CSTA and SU(3). It is shown that the symmetry group of those subgroups is indeed U(1) \otimes SU(2) \otimes SU(3) and that there are 4 distinct copies of this group within CSTA.
