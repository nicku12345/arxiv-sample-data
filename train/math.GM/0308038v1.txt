Generally the study of algebraic deals with the concepts like groups, semigroups, groupoids, loops, rings, near-rings, semirings and vector spaces. The study of bialgebraic structures deals with the study of bistructures like bigroups, biloops, bigroupoids, bisemigroups, birings, binear-rings, bisemirings and bivector spaces.   A complete study of these bialgebraic structures and their Smarandache analogues is carried out in this book.
