The lack of uniqueness arising by oversampling of Fourier coefficients is shown to provide a way of transmitting hidden information. A basic encoding/decoding system, developed on the basis of such a possibility, is discussed. The system is devised with the double purpose of: (a) enabling the transmission of an arbitrary signal and (b) allowing for the transmission of a hidden embedded code.
