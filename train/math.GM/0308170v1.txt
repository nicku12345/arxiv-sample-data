Generally, in any human field, a Smarandache Structure on a set A means a weak structure W on A such that there exists a proper subset B which is embedded with a stronger structure S.   By a proper subset one understands a set included in A, different from the empty set, from the unit element if any, and from A.   These types of structures occur in our every day's life, that's why we study them in this book.   Thus, as a particular case, we investigate the theory of linear algebra and Smarandache linear algebra.
