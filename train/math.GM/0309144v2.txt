The author studies the Smarandache Fuzzy Algebra, which, like its predecessor Fuzzy Algebra, arose from the need to define structures that were more compatible with the real world where the grey areas mattered, not only black or white.   This book has seven chapters, which are divided into two parts. Part I contains the first chapter, and Part II encloses the remaining six chapters. In the first chapter (which also forms the first part), which is subdivided into twelve sections, we deal with eleven distinct fuzzy algebraic concepts and in the concluding section list the miscellaneous properties of fuzzy algebra. The eleven fuzzy algebraic concepts which we analyze are fuzzy sets, fuzzy subgroups, fuzzy sub-bigroups, fuzzy rings, fuzzy birings, fuzzy fields, fuzzy semirings, fuzzy near-rings, fuzzy vector spaces, fuzzy semigroups and fuzzy half-groupoids. The results used in these sections are extensive and we have succeeded in presenting new concepts defined by several researchers.
