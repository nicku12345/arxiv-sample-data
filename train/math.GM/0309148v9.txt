It has been well known since Fermat's Little Theorem was first published that it is possible to determine that a number is composite without determining any of its nontrivial factors. It is natural to ask whether it is also possible to compute the Moebius function of a composite number without determining any of its nontrivial factors. In this note, we argue that this is impossible.
