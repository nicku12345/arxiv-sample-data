Investigating Dirichlet L functional equation, the author found the relationship between Dirichlet L functional equation and the prime property function, two new corollaries based on GRH is tenable and the equation of the prime property function. By using the geometric method, the author obtained a formula for solving the properties of primes within the prime series.
