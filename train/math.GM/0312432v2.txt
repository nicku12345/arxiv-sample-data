This is a Research and Instructional Development Project from the U. S. Naval Academy. In this monograph, the basic methods of nonstandard analysis for n-dimensional Euclidean spaces are presented. Specific rules are deveoped and these methods and rules are applied to rigorous integral and differential modeling. The topics include Robinson infinitesimals, limited and infinite numbers; convergence theory, continuity, *-transfer, internal definition, hyprefinite summation, Riemann-Stieltjes integration over Jordan-measurable regions; modeling with integrals via Infinite Sum Theorems; the nonstandard integral modeling rules - the method of constants, the methods of max. and min., and the hyperfinite sum; pure infinitesimal integral modeling via geometric elements; microgeometry, line and surface integrals, gauge integrals, fluxions and their relations to dynamic geometry. These rigorous results are also applied to lengths of curves, areas and volumes for Jordan-measurable regions, incompressible fluids, moments of inertia, electric field vectors, force fields and very elementary physics. Also presented are rigorous differential derivations for the partial differential equations for internal heat transfer and the vibrating membrane. All results are rigorously established and, mostly, all proofs appear in the appendix.
