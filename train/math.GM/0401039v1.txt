The present work pursues the aim to draw attention to unique possibilities of the skew-symmetric differential forms. At present the theory of skew-symmetric exterior differential forms that possess invariant properties has been developed. In the work the readers are introduced to the skew-symmetric differential forms that were called evolutionary ones because they possess evolutionary properties. The combined mathematical apparatus of exterior and evolutionary skew-symmetric differential forms in essence is a new mathematical language. This apparatus can describe transitions from nonconjugated operators to conjugated ones. There are no such possibilities in any mathematical formalism. In the present work it has been shown that the properties of exterior or evolutionary forms are explicitly or implicitly accounted for in all mathematical (and physical) formalisms.
