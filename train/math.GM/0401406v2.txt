From a global series for the alternating zeta function, we derive an infinite product for pi that resembles the product for e^\gamma (\gamma is Euler's constant) in math.CA/0306008. (An alternate derivation accelerates Wallis's product by Euler's transformation.) We account for the resemblance via an analytic continuation of the polylogarithm. An application is a 1-dim. analog for ln(pi/2) of the 2-dim. integrals for ln(4/pi) and \gamma in math.CA/0211148.
