We introduce a duality triads` notion. These are dual recurrences as used in dynamical data bases theory completed by a third pertinacious relation. Several representative examples of them are given. q-Gaussian triads as well as Fibonomial triangle and duality triads in finite operator calculus are presented in the paper that follows this one .
