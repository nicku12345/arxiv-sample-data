The duality triads were defined in the preceding paper.(ArXiv: math.GM/0402260 v 1 Feb. 2004). Notation, enumeration of formulas and references is therefore to be continued hereby. In this paper Fibonomial triangle and further Pascal-like triangles including q-Gaussian one are given explicit interpretation as discrete time dynamical systems as it is the case with all duality triads.
