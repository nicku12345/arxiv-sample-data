It is well known that a compact two dimensional surface is homeomorphic to a polygon with the edges identified in pairs. This paper not only presents a new proof of this statement but also generalizes it to any connected n-dimensional stellar manifold with a finite number of vertices. The study of an n-dimensional stellar sphere with the boundary faces identified in pairs leads us to Coxeter groups of stellar manifolds. Analysis of these Coxeter groups allows us to single out the class of so called flat stellar manifolds. Flat stellar manifolds are not only very common but also possess a range of simple properties that allow to prove some difficult long standing statements. In particular, there exists a simple proof of the Poincar\`e conjecture for flat manifolds.It is not possible to carry out this simple proof for a general stellar manifolds because of certain singularities that can be characterized in terms of Coxeter groups. The results and ideas presented in this paper not only open a new way that may lead to entirely combinatorial and algebraic proof of the Poincar\`e conjecture but also suggest a new technique for studying stellar manifolds in terms of properties of their Coxeter groups.
