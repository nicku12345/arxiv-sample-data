The proofs that the real numbers are denumerable will be shown, i.e., that there exists one-to-one correspondence between the natural numbers N and the real numbers \Re. The general element of the sequence that contains all real numbers will be explicitly specified, and the first few elements of the sequence will be written. Remarks on the Cantor's nondenumerability proofs of 1873 and 1891 that the real numbers are noncountable will be given.
