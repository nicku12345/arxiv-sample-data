Remarks on the Cantor's nondenumerability proof of 1891 that the real numbers are noncountable will be given. By the Cantor's diagonal procedure, it is not possible to build numbers that are different from all numbers in a general assumed denumerable sequence of all real numbers. The numbers created on the diagonal of the assumed sequence are not different from the numbers in the assumed denumerable sequence or they do not belong to that sequence.
