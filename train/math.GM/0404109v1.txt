Old algorithms are still in use nowadays setting the Easter date accordingly to some elements giving the Spring Equinox and the New Moon for a given year. At least two different approaches (by the Orthodox and Catholic Churches) provide different results, most of the times different than the actual moments given by the two astronomical phenomena. A new algorithm built accordingly to the Niceea rule and based on some simple astronomical formulas is presented. It is proposed to replace the old different approaches, in order to celebrate the Easter at the same common date. A Windows program is provided, together with a table listing the Easter date between the years 1950-2050 calculated using the Orthodox, Catholic and the Astronomical approaches.
