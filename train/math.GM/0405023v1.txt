This article presents a necessary and sufficient theorem for N numbers, coprime two by two, to be prime simultaneously. It generalizes V. Popa's theorem, as well as I. Cucurezeanu's theorem, Clement's theorem, S. Patrizio's theorems, etc. Particularly, this General Theorem offers many characterizations for twin primes, for quadruple primes, and so on.
