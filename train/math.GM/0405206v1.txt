First, we consider the equation ax^2 - by^2 + c = 0, with a,b \in N* and c \in Z*, which is a generalization of Pell's equation. Here, we show that: if this equation has an integer solution and ab is not a perfect square, then it has infinitely many integer solutions; in this case we find a closed expression for (x_{n}, y_{n}), the general positive integer solution, by an original method. More, we generalize it for a Diophantine equation of second degree and with n variables of the form: \sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i}x_{i}^{2} = b.
