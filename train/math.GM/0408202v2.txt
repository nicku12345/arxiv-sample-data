The reality of the difficulties in investigation of finite groups are considered. It is shown that the consideration of symmetry properties of the k-orbits that are obtained with an action of a finite group F=(V,\cdot) on Cartesian power V^k gives a new view on the nature of groups and simplifies some difficult properties of groups.   Using this representation it is obtained a simple proof of the W. Feit, J.G. Thompson theorem: Solvability of groups of odd order.
