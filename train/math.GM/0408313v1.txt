Perhaps one of the most intriguing questions in philosophy concerns the true nature of external reality. In this paper, we discuss some of the theories that have been put forth regarding the nature of reality and of our perceived universe. We develop an abstract mathematical model, whereby, several theories that have been proposed so, ranging from modern physics to ancient Indian philosophy can be brought under a common umbrella. We also discuss a specific case, which emerges from our more general model, which has an interesting consequence upon the way we view our world.
