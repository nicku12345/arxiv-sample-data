Neutrosophic set is a part of neutrosophy which studies the origin, nature, and scope of neutralities, as well as their interactions with different ideational spectra. Neutrosophic set is a powerful general formal framework that has been recently proposed. However, neutrosophic set needs to be specified from a technical point of view. To this effect, we define the set-theoretic operators on an instance of neutrosophic set, we call it interval neutrosophic set (INS). We prove various properties of INS, which are connected to the operations and relations over INS. Finally, we introduce and prove the convexity of interval neutrosophic sets.
