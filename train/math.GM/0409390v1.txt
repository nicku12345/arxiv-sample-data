In this paper, an \mathbb{R}-analytical function and the sequence of its Taylor polynomials (which are Lyapunov functions different from those of Vanelli & Vidyasagar (1985, Automatica, 21(1):6 9--80)) is presented, in order to determine and approximate the domain of attraction of the exponentially asymptotically stable zero steady state of an autonomous, \mathbb{R}-analytical system of differential equations. The analytical function and the sequence of its Taylor polynomials are constructed by recurrence formulae using the coefficients of the power series expansion of f at 0.
