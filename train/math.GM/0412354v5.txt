The aim of this paper is to exhibit a method for proving that certain analytic functions are not solutions of algebraic differential equations. The method is based on model-theoretic properties of differential fields and properties of certain known transcendental differential functions, as of \Gamma(x). Furthermore, it also determines differential transcendency of solution of some functional equations.
