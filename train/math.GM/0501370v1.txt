J. Tuma proved an interesting "congruence amalgamation" result. We are generalizing and providing an alternate proof for it. We then provide applications of this result: --A.P. Huhn proved that every distributive algebraic lattice D with at most \aleph\_1 compact elements can be represented as the congruence lattice of a lattice L. We show that L can be constructed as a locally finite relatively complemented lattice with zero. --We find a large class of lattices, the \omega-congruence-finite lattices, that contains all locally finite countable lattices, in which every lattice has a relatively complemented congruence-preserving extension.
