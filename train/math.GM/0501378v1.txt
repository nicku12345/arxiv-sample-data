We prove the following result: Let K be a lattice, let D be a distributive lattice with zero, and let \phi: Con K \to D be a {&#8744;, 0}-homomorphism, where Conc K denotes the {&#8744;, 0}-semilattice of all &#64257;nitely generated congruences of K. Then there are a lattice L, a lattice homomorphism f : K \to L, and an isomorphism \ga: Conc L \to D such that \ga Conc f = \phi. Furthermore, L and f satisfy many additional properties, for example: (i) L is relatively complemented. (ii) L has de&#64257;nable principal congruences. (iii) If the range of \phi is co&#64257;nal in D, then the convex sublattice of L generated by f[K] equals L. We mention the following corollaries, that extend many results obtained in the last decades in that area: -- Every lattice K such that Conc K is a lattice admits a congruence-preserving extension into a relatively complemented lattice. -- Every {&#8744;, 0}-direct limit of a countable sequence of distributive lattices with zero is isomorphic to the semilattice of compact congruences of a relatively complemented lattice with zero.
