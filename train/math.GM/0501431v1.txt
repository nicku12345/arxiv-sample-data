Let A, B, and S be (v,0)-semilattices and let f: A\to B be a (v,0)-embedding. Then the canonical map, f \otimes \id\_S, of the tensor product A \otimes S into the tensor product B \otimes S is not necessarily an embedding. The (v,0)-semilattice S is flat, if for every embedding f : A\to B, the canonical map f\otimes\id is an embedding. We prove that a (v,0)-semilattice S is flat if and only if it is distributive.
