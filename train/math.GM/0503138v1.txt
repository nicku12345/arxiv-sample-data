The notion of intuitionistic fuzzy sets was introduced by Atanassov as a generalization of the notion of fuzzy sets. In this paper, we consider the intuitionistic fuzzification of the concept of sub-hyperquasigroups in a hyperquasigroup and investigate some properties of such sub-hyperquasigroups. In particular, we investigate some natural equivalence relations on the set of all intuitionistic fuzzy sub-hyperquasigroups of a hyperquasigroup.
