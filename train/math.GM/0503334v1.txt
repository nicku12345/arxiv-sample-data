The paper contains a proof of the conjecture of M. Klin and D. Maru\breve{\rm s}i\breve{\rm c} that an automorphism group of a transitive graph contains a permutation, decomposed in cycles of the same length. The proof is based on the k-orbit theory developed by author.   Key words: k-orbits, partitions, permutations, symmetry, groups
