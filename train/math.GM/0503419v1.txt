Let \{x\_n\}\_{n\geq 0} be a sequence of [0,1]^d, \{\lambda\_n\} \_{n\geq 0} a sequence of positive real numbers converging to 0, and \delta>1. Let \mu be a positive Borel measure on [0,1]^d, \rho\in (0,1] and \alpha>0. Consider the limsup-set \[S\_{\mu}(\rho,\delta,\alpha)= \bigcap\_{N\in \mathbb{N}} \bigcup \_{n\geq N: \mu(B(x\_n,\lambda^\rho\_n)) \sim \lambda\_n^{\rho\alpha}} B(x\_n,\lambda\_n^\delta).\] We show that, under suitable assumptions on the measure \mu, the Hausdorff dimension of the sets S\_{\mu}(\rho,\delta,\alpha) can be computed. When \rho<1, a yet unknown saturation phenomenon appears in the computation of the Hausdorff dimension of S\_{\mu} (\rho,\delta, \alpha). Our results apply to several classes of multifractal measures \mu. The computation of the dimensions of such sets opens the way to the study of several new objects and phenomena. Applications are given for the Diophantine approximation conditioned by (or combined with) b-adic expansion properties, by averages of some Birkhoff sums and by asymptotic behavior of random covering numbers.
