This study actually draws from and builds on an earlier paper (Kumar and Bhattacharya, 2002). Here we have basically added a neutrosophic dimension to the problem of determining the conditional probability that a financial fraud has been actually committed, given that no Type I error occurred while rejecting the null hypothesis H0: The observed first-digit frequencies approximate a Benford distribution; and accepting the alternative hypothesis H1: The observed first-digit frequencies do not approximate a Benford distribution. We have also suggested a conceptual model to implement such a neutrosophic fraud detection system.
