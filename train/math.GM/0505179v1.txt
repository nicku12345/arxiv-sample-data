We extend the theory of distributional kernel operators to a framework of generalized functions, in which they are replaced by integral kernel operators. Moreover, in contrast to the distributional case, we show that these generalized integral operators can be composed unrestrictedly. This leads to the definition of the exponential of a subclass of such operators.
