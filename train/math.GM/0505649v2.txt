All sciences need and many arts apply mathematics whereas mathematics seems to be independent of all of them, but only based upon logic. This conservative concept, however, needs to be revised because, contrary to Platonic idealism (frequently called "realism" by mathematicians), mathematical ideas, notions, and, in particular, numbers are not at all independent of physical laws and prerequisites.
