Generally any real-world problem is not always solvable, because in that not only a percentage of uncertainty is present, but also, a certain percentage of indeterminacy is present. The presence of uncertainty has been analyzed using fuzzy logic. In this book the amount of indeterminacy is being analyzed using neutrosophic logic. Most of these models use the concept of matrices. Matrices have certain limitation; when the models are time-dependent and any two experts' opinions are being studied simultaneously, one cannot compare both of them at each stage. The new concept of bimatrices would certainly cater to these needs.   A bimatrix AB = A1 U A2, where A1 and A2 are distinct matrices of arbitrary order. This book introduces the concept of bimatrices, and studies several notions like bieigen values, bieigen vectors, characteristic bipolynomials, bitransformations, bioperators and bidiagonalization. Further, we introduce and explore the concepts like fuzzy bimatrices, neutrosophic bimatrices and fuzzy neutrosophic bimatrices, which will find its application in fuzzy and neutrosophic logic.
