Let z=(z_1, z_2, ..., z_n) be noncommutative free variables and t a formal parameter which commutes with z. Let k be any unital integral domain of any characteristic and F_t(z)=z-H_t(z) with H_t(z)\in {k[[t]]< < z >>}^{\times n} and the order o(H_t(z))\geq 2. Note that F_t(z) can be viewed as a deformation of the formal map F(z):=z-H_{t=1}(z) when it makes sense (for example, when H_t(z)\in {k[t]< < z >>}^{\times n}). The inverse map G_t(z) of F_t(z) can always be written as G_t(z)=z+M_t(z) with M_t(z)\in {k[[t]]< < z >>}^{\times n} and o(M_t(z))\geq 2. In this paper, we first derive the PDE's satisfied by M_t(z) and u(F_t), u(G_t)\in {k[[t]]< < z >>} with u(z)\in {k< < z >>} in the general case as well as in the special case when H_t(z)=tH(z) for some H(z)\in {k< < z >>}^{\times n}. We also show that the formal power series above are actually characterized by certain Cauchy problems of these PDE's. Secondly, we apply the derived PDE's to prove a recurrent inversion formula for formal maps in noncommutative variables. Finally, for the case char. k=0, we derive an expansion inversion formula by the planar binary rooted trees.
