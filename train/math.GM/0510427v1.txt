A Smarandache multi-space is a union of n spaces A_1,A_2,..., A_n with some additional conditions holding. Combining classical of a group with Smarandache multi-spaces, the conception of a multi-group space is introduced in this paper, which is a generalization of the classical algebraic structures, such as the group, filed, body, ..., etc.. Similar to groups, some characteristics of a multi-group space are obtained in this paper.
