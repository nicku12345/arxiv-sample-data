Goedel's results have had a great impact in diverse fields such as philosophy, computer sciences and fundamentals of mathematics.   The fact that the rule of mathematical induction is contradictory with the rest of clauses used by Goedel to prove his undecidability and incompleteness theorems is proved in this paper. This means that those theorems are invalid.
