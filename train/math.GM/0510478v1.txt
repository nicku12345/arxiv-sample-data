A Smarandache multi-space is a union of n spaces A_1,A_2,..., A_n with some additional conditions holding. Combining Smarandache multi-spaces with rings in classical ring theory, the conception of multi-ring spaces is introduced. Some characteristics of a multi-ring space are obtained in this paper.
