This book is organized into four chapters. In Chapter One we just introduce the basic Fuzzy and Neutrosophic tools used in the analysis of the social evil of Untouchability. Since the notion of caste is based on themind, it is appropriate to use Fuzzy and Neutrosophic theory. In Chapter Two we use the opinion of several experts to analyze the various aspects of untouchability. Here, we use the tools that have been described in Chapter One. Fuzzy Directed Graphs and Neutrosophic Directed Graphs of these Fuzzy and Neutrosophic models happen to be very dense. We have represented 16 such graphs in this book. In Chapter Three we give a brief introduction about the life and struggle of Periyar. The fourth and concluding chapter gives observations drawn from our mathematical results based on the Fuzzy and Neutrosophic analysis.
