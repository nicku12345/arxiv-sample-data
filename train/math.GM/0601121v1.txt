As a consequence, we obtain that the topological closure of the collection of principal initial segments of a poset P is the Stone space of the Boolean algebra Tailalg (P) generated by the collection of principal final segments of P, the so-called {\it tail-algebra of P}. Similar results concerning Priestley spaces and distributive lattices are given. A generalization to incidence structures valued by abstract algebras is considered.
