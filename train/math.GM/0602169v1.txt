An {\em MV-pair} is a pair (B,G) where B is a Boolean algebra and G is a subgroup of the automorphism group of B satisfying certain conditions. Let \sim_G be the equivalence relation on B naturally associated with G. We prove that for every MV-pair (B,G), the effect algebra B/\sim_G is an MV- effect algebra. Moreover, for every MV-effect algebra M there is an MV-pair (B,G) such that M is isomorphic to B/\sim_G.
