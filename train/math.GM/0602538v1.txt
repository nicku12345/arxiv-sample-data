Let P(x,z)= z^d +\sum_{i=1}^{d}a_i(x)z^{d-i} be a polynomial, where a_i are real analytic functions in an open subset U of \R^n. If for any x \in U the polynomial z\mapsto P(x,z) has only real roots, then we can write those roots as locally lipschitz functions of x. Moreover, there exists a modification (a locally finite composition of blowing-ups with smooth centers) \sigma : W \to U such that the roots of the corresponding polynomial \tilde P(w,z) =P(\sigma (w),z), w\in W , can be written locally as analytic functions of w. Let A(x), x\in U be an analytic family of symmetric matrices, where U is open in \R^n. Then there exists a modification \sigma : W \to U, such the corresponding family \tilde A(w) =A(\sigma(w)) can be locally diagonalized analytically (i.e. we can choose locally eigenvectors in an analytic way). This generalizes the Rellich's well known theorem (1937) for one-parameter families. Similarly for an analytic family A(x), x\in U of antisymmetric matrices there exits a modification \sigma such that we can find locally a basis of proper subspaces in an analytic way.
