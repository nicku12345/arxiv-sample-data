In this paper we propose a quantum gauge system from which we construct generalized Wilson loops which will be as quantum knots. From quantum knots we give a classification table of knots where knots are one-to-one assigned with an integer such that prime knots are bijectively assigned with prime numbers and the prime number 2 corresponds to the trefoil knot.   Then by considering the quantum knots as periodic orbits of the quantum system and by the identity of knots with integers and an approach which is similar to the quantum chaos approach of Berry and Keating we derive a trace formula which may be called the von Mangoldt-Selberg-Gutzwiller trace formula.   From this trace formula we then give a proof of the Riemann Hypothesis. For our proof of the Riemann Hypothesis we show that the Hilbert-Polya conjecture holds that there is a self-adjoint operator for the nontrivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function and this operator is the Virasoro energy operator with central charge c=\frac12. Our approach for proving the Riemann Hypothesis can also be extended to prove the Extended Riemann Hypothesis. We also investigate the relation of our approach for proving the Riemann Hypothesis with the Random Matrix Theory for L-functions.
