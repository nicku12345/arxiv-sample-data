This book has seven chapters. In Chapter one, an elaborate recollection of Smarandache structures like S-semigroups, S-loops, and S-groupoids is given. It also gives notions about N-ary algebraic stuctures and their Smarandache analogue, Neutrosophic structures viz. groups, semigroups, groupoids and loops are given in Chapter one to make the book a self-contained one. For the first time, S-neutrosophic groups and S-neutrosophic N-groups are introduced in Chapter two and their properties are given. S-neutrosophic semigroups and S-neutrosophic N-semigroups are defined and discussed in Chapter three. Chapter four defines S-neutrosophic S-loops and S-N-neutrosophic groupoids and their generalizations are given in Chapter five. Chapter six gives S-neutrosophic mixed N-structures and their duals. Chapter seven gives 68 problems for any interested reader.
