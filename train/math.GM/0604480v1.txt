A Smarandache multi-space is a union of n different spaces equipped with some different structures for an integer n\geq 2, which can be both used for discrete or connected spaces, particularly for geometries and spacetimes in theoretical physics. This paper is the first part on characterizing multi-spaces. Various algebraic multi-spaces with structures such as those of multi-groups, multi-rings, multi-vector spaces, multi-metric spaces, multi-operation systems are discussed and new results are obtained.
