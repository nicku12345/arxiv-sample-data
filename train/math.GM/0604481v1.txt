A Smarandache multi-space is a union of n different spaces equipped with some different structures for an integer n\geq 2, which can be both used for discrete or connected spaces, particularly for geometries and spacetimes in theoretical physics. This is second part on multi-spaces. Many conceptions in graphs are generalized by Smarandache's notion, such as multi-voltage graphs, Cayley graphs of a finite multi-group,multi-embedding of a graph in an n-manifold, graph phase, ..., etc.. New results are obtained.
