A Smarandache multi-space is a union of n different spaces equipped with some different structures for an integer n\geq 2, which can be both used for discrete or connected spaces, particularly for geometries and spacetimes in theoretical physics. This is the third part on multi-spaces concertrating on Smarandache geometries, including those of map geometries, planar map geometries and pseudo-plane geometries. In where, the Finsler geometry, particularly the Riemann geometry appears as a special case of these Smarandache geometries.
