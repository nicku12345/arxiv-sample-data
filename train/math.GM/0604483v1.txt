A Smarandache multi-space is a union of n different spaces equipped with some different structures for an integer n\geq 2, which can be both used for discrete or connected spaces, particularly for geometries and spacetimes in theoretical physics. This is the 4th part of multi-spaces considering applications of multi-spaces to theoretical physics, including the relativity theory, the M-theory and the cosmology. Multi-space models for p-branes and cosmos are constructed and some questions in cosmology are clarified by multi-spaces.
