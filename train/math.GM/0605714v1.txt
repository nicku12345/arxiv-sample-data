On the basis of the concept of the interval valued intuitionistic fuzzy sets introduced by K.Atanassov, the notion of interval valued intuitionistic fuzzy H_v-submodules of an H_v-module with respect to t-norm T and s-norm S is given and the characteristic properties are described. The homomorphic image and the inverse image are investigated.In particular, the connections between interval valued intuitionistic (S,T)-fuzzy H_v-submodules and interval valued intuitionistic (S,T)-fuzzy submodules are discussed.
