In this paper we present a method to obtain a possible self-adjoint Hamiltonian operator so its energies satisfy Z(1/2+iE_n)=0, which is an statement equivalent to Riemann Hypothesis, first we use the explicit formula for the Chebyshev function Psi(x) and apply the change x=exp(u), after that we consider an Statistical partition function involving the Chebyshev function and its derivative so Z=Tr(exp(-BH), from the integral definition of the partition function Z we try to obtain the Hamiltonian operator assuming that H=P^{2}+V(x) by proposing a Non-linear integral equation involving Z(B=-iu) and V(x).
