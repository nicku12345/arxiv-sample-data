We compute hyperdeterminants of hypermatrices whose indices belongs in a meet-semilattice and whose entries depend only of the greatest lower bound of the indices. One shows that an elementary expansion of such a polynomial allows to generalize a theorem of Lindstr\"om to higher-dimensional determinants. And we gave as an application generalizations of some results due to Lehmer, Li and Haukkanen.
