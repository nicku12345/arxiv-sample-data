The hyperdeteminants considered here are the simplest analogues of determinants for higher rank tensors which have been defined by Cayley, and apply only to tensors with an even number of indices. We have shown in a previous article that the calculation of certain multidimensional integrals could be reduced to the evaluation of hyperdeterminants of Hankel type. Here, we carry out this computation by purely algebraic means in the cases of Selberg's and Aomoto's integrals.
