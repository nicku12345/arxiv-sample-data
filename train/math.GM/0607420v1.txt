Let \M(A,\theta) be a free partially commutative monoid. We give here a necessary and sufficient condition on a subalphabet B\subset A such that the right factor of a bisection \M(A,\theta)=\M(B,\theta\_B).T be also partially commutative free. This extends strictly the (classical) elimination theory on partial commutations and allows to construct new factorizations of \M(A,\theta) and associated bases of L\_K(A,\theta).
