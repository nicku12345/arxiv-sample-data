New fundamental mathematical structures are introduced by the triples (left semistructure,right semistructure,bisemistructure) associated with the classical mathematical structures and such that the bisemistructures,resulting from the reciprocal actions of left semistructures on right semistructures,are composed of bielements which are either diagonal bielements or cross bielements.
