The idea of left(right) palindromic permutations(LPPs,RPPs) and left(right) generalized Smarandache palindromic permutations(LGSPPs,RGSPPs) are introduced in symmetric groups S_n of degree n. It is shown that in S_n, there exist a LPP and a RPP and they are unique(this fact is demonstrated using S_2 and S_3). The dihedral group D_n is shown to be generated by a RGSPP and a LGSPP(this is observed to be true in S_3) but the geometric interpretations of a RGSPP and a LGSPP are found not to be rotation and reflection respectively. In S_3, each permutation is at least a RGSPP or a LGSPP. There are 4 RGSPPs and 4 LGSPPs in S_3, while 2 permutations are both RGSPPs and LGSPPs. A permutation in S_n is shown to be a LPP or RPP(LGSPP or RGSPP) if and only if its inverse is a LPP or RPP(LGSPP or RGSPP) respectively. Problems for future studies are raised.
