It is known that a graph isomorphism testing algorithm is polynomially equivalent to a detecting of a graph non-trivial automorphism algorithm. The polynomiality of the latter algorithm, is obtained by consideration of symmetry properties of regular k-partitions that, on one hand, generalize automorphic k-partitions (=systems of k-orbits of permutation groups), and, on other hand, schemes of relations (strongly regular 2-partitions or regular 3-partitions), that are a subject of the algebraic combinatorics.   It is shown that the stabilization of a graph by quadrangles detects the triviality of the graph automorphism group. The result is obtained by lineariation of the algebraic combinatorics.   Keywords: k-partitions, symmetry, algebraic combinatorics
