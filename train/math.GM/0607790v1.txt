A map is a connected topological graph cellularly embedded in a surface and a complete map is a cellularly embedded complete graph in a surface. In this paper, all automorphisms of complete maps of order n are determined by permutations on its vertices. Applying a scheme for enumerating maps on surfaces with a given underlying graph, the numbers of unrooted complete maps on orientable or non-orientable surfaces are obtained.
