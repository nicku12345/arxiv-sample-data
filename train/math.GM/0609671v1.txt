It is a generalization of Pell's equation x^2-Dy^2=0. Here, we show that: if our Diophantine equation has a particular integer solution and ab is not a perfect square, then the equation has an infinite number of solutions; in this case we find a close expression for (x_n,y_n), the general positive integer solution, by an original method. More, we generalize it for any Diophantine equation of second degree and with two unknowns f(x,y)=0.
