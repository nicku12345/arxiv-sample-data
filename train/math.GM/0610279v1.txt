The essentials of a new method in solving very large classes of nonlinear systems of PDEs, possibly associated with initial and/or boundary value problems, are presented. The PDEs can be defined by continuous, not necessarily smooth expressions, and the solutions obtained cab be assimilated with usual measurable functions, or even with Hausdorff continuous ones. The respective result sets aside completely, and with a large nonlinear margin, the celebrated 1957 impossibility of Hans Lewy regarding the nonexistence of solution in distributions of large classes of linear smooth coefficient PDEs.
