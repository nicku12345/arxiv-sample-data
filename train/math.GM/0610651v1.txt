In this paper we introduce a new type of differential equations with piecewise constant argument (EPCAG), more general than EPCA. The Reduction Principle is proved for EPCAG. The structure of the set of solutions is specified. We establish also the existence of global integral manifolds of quasilinear EPCAG in the so called critical case and investigate the stability of the zero solution.
