Complex classical Cayley-Klein categories {\bf A({\bj})}, {\bf B({\bj})}, {\bf C({\bj})} and {\bf D({\bj})} are constructed by the method of categorical extension of the complex classical Cayley-Klein groups SL(2n;{\bj};{\Bbb C}), SO(2n+1;{\bj};{\Bbb C}), Sp(2n;{\bj};{\Bbb C}) and SO(2n;{\bj};{\Bbb C}), respectively. The explicit construction of the irreducible representations of the complex classical Cayley-Klein categories is received. Completeness of lists of the irreducible representations of the complex classical Cayley-Klein categories and the classification theorems are proved.
