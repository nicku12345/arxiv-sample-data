A method for selecting a suitable subspace for discriminating signal components through an oblique projection is proposed. The selection criterion is based on the consistency principle introduced by M. Unser and A. Aldroubi and extended by Y. Elder. An effective implementation of this principle for the purpose of subspace selection is achieved by updating of the dual vectors yielding the corresponding oblique projector.
