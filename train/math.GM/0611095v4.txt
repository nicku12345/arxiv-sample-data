In the paper a new generalization of the Golden mean, as a further generalization in relation to Stakhov (1989) and to Spinadel (1999), is presented. Also it is first observed that the Euler divine equation represents a possible generalization of Golden mean. In this fourth version Figure A1 and Tables A3-A10 are added.
