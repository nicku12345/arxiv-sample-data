In this book the authors probe into Vedic Mathematics (a concept that gained renown in the period of the religious fanatic and revivalist Hindutva rule in India): and explore whether it is really 'Vedic' in origin or 'Mathematics' in content. We analyzed this problem using fuzzy models like Fuzzy Cognitive Maps (FCM), Fuzzy Relational Maps (FRM) and the newly constructed fuzzy dynamical system (and its Neutrosophic analogue) that can analyze multi-experts opinion at a time using a single model. The issue of Vedic Mathematics involves religious politics, caste supremacy, apart from elementary arithmetic -- so we cannot use simple statistics for our analysis.
