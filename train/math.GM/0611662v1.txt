Assuming that a "derivative" ratio rho:=f'/g' of the ratio r:=f/g of differentiable functions f and g is strictly monotonic (that is, rho is increasing or decreasing), it was shown in previous papers that then r can switch at most once, from decrease to increase or vice versa. In the present paper, it is shown that, if rho is non-strictly monotonic (that is, non-increasing or non-decreasing), then r can have at most one maximal interval of constancy (m.i.c.); on the other hand, any one m.i.c. of a given derivative ratio rho is the m.i.c. of an appropriately constructed original ratio r.
