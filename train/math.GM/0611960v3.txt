A great number of articles widen a known scientific result P(a) (such as: a theorem, an inequality, or a math/physics/chemical etc. proposition or formula) by a simple recurrence procedure and using, in the proof, the proposition P(a) itself. We present, as examples, the generalizations of H\"older's inequality, of Minkovski's inequality, of Tchebychev's inequality, and of the Theorem of Menelaus respectively.
