We describe a procedure of counting all equilateral triangles in the three dimensional space whose coordinates are allowed only in the set \{0,1,...,n\}. This sequence is denoted here by ET(n) and it has the entry A102698 in "The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences". The procedure is implemented in Maple and its main idea is based on the results in \cite{eji}. Using this we calculated the values ET(n) for n=1..55 which are included here. Some facts and conjectures about this sequence are stated. The main of them is that \ds \lim_{n\to \infty} \frac{\ln ET(n)}{\ln n+1} exists.
