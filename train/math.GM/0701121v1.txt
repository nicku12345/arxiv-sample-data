Logicians study and apply a multiplicity of various logical systems. Consequently, there is necessity to build foundations and common grounds for all these systems. This is done in metalogic. Like metamathematics studies formalized mathematical theories, metalogic studies theories in logic, or logics. The discipline of logic has been developed with the aim to model and study human thinking and reasoning. A more realistic understanding relates logic only to reasoning. Reasoning is a mental and verbal activity. Any activity is based on actions and operations organized by procedures and algorithms. That is why procedures and algorithms are basic for the development of different logics, their study and application. In this work, we study structures used in logic with the aim to reflect goals of logic as a discipline. The main structure is a logical calculus, which pivotal for the contemporary logic. Logical calculus is considered here as a two-tier construction with a logical language on the first level and the calculus itself on the second level. A system of interdependencies that exists between properties of deductive calculi and utilized by these calculi algorithms are explicated and studied. Here only syntactic parts of logics, namely, deductive logical calculi and corresponding languages are considered. Semantic and pragmatic parts are studied elsewhere.
