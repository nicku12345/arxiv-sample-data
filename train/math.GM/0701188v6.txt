In the present work we demonstrate that the so called Goldbach conjecture from 1742, All positive even numbers greater than two can be expressed as a sum of two primes, due to Leonhard Euler, is a true statement. This result is partially based on the Wilson theorem, and complementary on our reasoning to cast the problem into a diophantine equation. The latter is the master equation for the conjectures proof.
