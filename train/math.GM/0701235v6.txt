In this article, Riemann Hypothesis will be proved . We introduce a new function that is related to the zeta function. All non-trivial zeros of zeta function are symmetric on the critical line, for this we obtained an integral equation for real variable. Using the mean value theorem for integrals, we proved that all non-trivial zeros of zeta function lie on the critical line. Riemann Hypothesis is true.
