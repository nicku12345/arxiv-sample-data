The purpose of the work is to furnish a complete study of a discrete and special function, discovered by the author and named with the Arabian letter "SHIN" {The letter SHIN is the thirteenth letter of the Arabian alphabet}. It includes three other papers, published in the International journal "Kragujevac Journal of Mathematics". The methods, the techniques and the style of the demonstration inside such a work, are all related to Leonhard Euler, the very great Swiss mathematician.
