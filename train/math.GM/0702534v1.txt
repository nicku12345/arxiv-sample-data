We describe the main features of the Research Experience for Undergraduates Program at the American Institute of Mathematics. We also present our perspective on identifying appropriate projects for students, guiding students as they begin work, and developing a collaborative research environment while maintaining individual projects for each student. Finally, we describe some aspects of the program which others may find useful.
