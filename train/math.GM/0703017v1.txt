After reviewing the three well-known methods to obtain Lie algebras and superalgebras from given ones, namely, contractions, deformations and extensions, we describe a fourth method recently introduced, the expansion of Lie (super)algebras. Expanded (super)algebras have, in general, larger dimensions than the original algebra, but also include the Inonu-Wigner and generalized IW contractions as a particular case. As an example of a physical application of expansions, we discuss the relation between the possible underlying gauge symmetry of eleven-dimensional supergravity and the superalgebra osp(1|32).
