For an integer m\geq 1, a combinatorial manifold \widetilde{M} is defined to be a geometrical object \widetilde{M} such that for \forall p\in\widetilde{M}, there is a local chart (U_p,\phi_p) enable \phi_p:U_p\to B^{n_{i_1}}\bigcup B^{n_{i_2}}\bigcup...\bigcup B^{n_{i_{s(p)}}} with B^{n_{i_1}}\bigcap B^{n_{i_2}}\bigcap...\bigcap B^{n_{i_{s(p)}}}\not=\emptyset, where B^{n_{i_j}} is an n_{i_j}-ball for integers 1\leq j\leq s(p)\leq m. Integral theory on these smoothly combinatorial manifolds are introduced. Some classical results, such as those of {\it Stokes'} theorem and {\it Gauss'} theorem are generalized to smoothly combinatorial manifolds in this paper.
