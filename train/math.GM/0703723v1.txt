Standard expositions of Goedel's 1931 paper on undecidable arithmetical propositions are based on two presumptions in Goedel's 1931 interpretation of his own, formal, reasoning - one each in Theorem VI and in Theorem XI - which do not meet Goedel's, explicitly stated, requirement of classically constructive, and intuitionistically unobjectionable, reasoning. We see how these objections can be addressed, and note some consequences.
