Connect each vertex of a convex quadrilateral Q to the midpoint of the next (proceeding counterclockwise) side. The four connecting lines create an interior quadrilateral I. We study the ratio area(I)/area(Q). We also determine what happens to area(I)/area(Q) when the four midpoints are replaced by points which divide the sides in the ratio of rho to (1-rho) proceeding clockwise. Here rho is any fixed number satisfying 0 < rho < 1.
