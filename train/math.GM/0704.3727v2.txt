Let K be a self-similar or self-affine set in R^d, let \mu be a self-similar or self-affine measure on it, and let G be the group of affine maps, similitudes, isometries or translations of R^d. Under various assumptions (such as separation conditions or we assume that the transformations are small perturbations or that K is a so called Sierpinski sponge) we prove theorems of the following types, which are closely related to each other;   Non-stability: There exists a constant c<1 such that for every g\in G we have either \mu(K\cap g(K)) <c \mu(K) or K\subset g(K).   Measure and topology: For every g\in G we have \mu(K\cap g(K)) > 0 \iff int_K (K\cap g(K)) is nonempty (where int_K is interior relative to K).   Extension: The measure \mu has a G-invariant extension to R^d.   Moreover, in many situations we characterize those g's for which \mu(K\cap g(K) > 0, and we also get results about those g's for which g(K)\su K or g(K)\supset K holds.
