We propose an algorithm to reduce a k-chromatic graph to a complete graph of largest possible order through a well defined sequence of contractions. We introduce a new matrix called transparency matrix and state its properties. We then define correct contraction procedure to be executed to get largest possible complete graph from given connected graph. We finally give a characterization for k-chromatic graphs and use it to settle Hadwigers conjecture.
