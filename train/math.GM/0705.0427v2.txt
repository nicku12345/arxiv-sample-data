We explicitly construct two classes of infinitly many commutative operators in terms of the deformed Virasoro algebra. We call one of them local integrals and the other nonlocal one, since they can be regarded as elliptic deformations of the local and nonlocal integrals of motion obtained by V.Bazhanov, S.Lukyanov and Al.Zamolodchikov.
