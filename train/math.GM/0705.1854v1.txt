Results of a multipart work are outlined. Use is made therein of the conjunction of the Riemann hypothesis, RH, and hypotheses advanced by the author. Let z(n) be the nth nonreal zero of the Riemann zeta-function with positive imaginary part in order of magnitude thereof. A relation is obtained, of the pair z(n) and the first derivative thereat of the zeta-function, to the preceding such pairs and the values of zeta at the points one-half plus a nonnegative multiple of four. That relation is derived from two forms of the density of the Laplace representation, on a certain vertical strip, of a meromorphic function constructed from zeta. Specific functions which play a central role therein are proven to have analytic extensions to the entire complex plane. It is established that the Laplace density is positive. That positivity implies RH and that each nonreal zero of zeta is simple. A metric geometry expression of the positivity of the density is derived. An analogous context is delineated relative to Dirichlet L-functions and the Ramanujan tau Dirichlet function.
