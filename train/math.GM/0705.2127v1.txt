We prove that the binary complexity of solving ordinary polynomial differential equations in terms of Puiseux series is single exponential in the number of terms in the series. Such a bound was given by Grigoriev [10] for Riccatti differential polynomials associated to ordinary linear differential operators. In this paper, we get the same bound for arbitrary differential polynomials. The algorithm is based on a differential version of the Newton-Puiseux procedure for algebraic equations.
