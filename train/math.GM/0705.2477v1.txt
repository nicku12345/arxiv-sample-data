Ces\`aro (C,\delta) means are studied for orthogonal expansions with respect to the weight function \prod_{i=1}^{d}|x_i|^{2\k_i} on the unit sphere, and for the corresponding weight functions on the unit ball and the Jacobi weight on the simplex. A sharp pointwise estimate is established for the (C,\d) kernel with \d > -1 and for the kernel of the projection operator, which allows us to derive the exact order for the norm of the   Ces\`aro means and the projection operator on these domains.
