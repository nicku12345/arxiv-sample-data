An odd meromorphic function f(s) is constructed from the Riemann zeta-function evaluated at one-half plus s. The partial fraction expansion, p(s), of f(s) is obtained using the conjunction of the Riemann hypothesis and hypotheses advanced by the author. That compound hypothesis and the expansion p(s) are employed in Part IV to derive the two-sided Laplace transform representation of f(s) on the open vertical strip of all s with real part between zero and four.
