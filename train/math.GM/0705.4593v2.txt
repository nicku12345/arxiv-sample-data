In Part I an odd meromorphic function f(s) has been constructed from the Riemann zeta-function evaluated at one-half plus s. The conjunction of the Riemann hypothesis and hypotheses advanced by the author in Part I is assumed. In Part IV we derive the two-sided Laplace transform representation of f(s) on the open vertical strip V of all s with real part between zero and four. An additional hypothesis is used to prove that the Laplace density of f(s) on the strip V is positive. Let z(n) be the nth critical zero of the Riemann zeta-function of positive imaginary part in order of magnitude thereof. In Part V an expression is derived for z(1). A relation is obtained of the pair z(n) and the first derivative thereat of the zeta-function to the preceding such pairs.
