A short proof of the generalized Riemann hypothesis (gRH in short) for zeta functions \zeta_{k} of algebraic number fields k - based on the Hecke's proof of the functional equation for \zeta_{k} and the method of the proof of the Riemann hypothesis derived in [M_{A}] (algebraic proof of the Riemann hypothesis) is given. The generalized Riemann hypothesis for Dirichlet L-functions is an immediately consequence of (gRH) for \zeta_{k} and suitable product formula which connects the Dedekind zetas with L-functions.
