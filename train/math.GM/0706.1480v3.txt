Every quasigroup (S,\cdot) belongs to a set of 6 quasigroups, called parastrophes denoted by (S,\pi_i), i\in \{1,2,3,4,5,6\}. It is shown that isotopy-isomorphy is a necessary and sufficient condition for any two distinct quasigroups (S,\pi_i) and (S,\pi_j), i,j\in \{1,2,3,4,5,6\} to be parastrophic invariant relative to the associative law. In addition, a necessary and sufficient condition for any two distinct quasigroups (S,\pi_i) and (S,\pi_j), i,j\in \{1,2,3,4,5,6\} to be parastrophic invariance under the associative law is either if the \pi_i-parastrophe of H is equivalent to the \pi_i-parastrophe of the holomorph of the \pi_i-parastrophe of S or if the \pi_i-parastrophe of H is equivalent to the \pi_k-parastrophe of the \pi_i-parastrophe of the holomorph of the \pi_i-parastrophe of S, for a particular k\in \{1,2,3,4,5,6\}.
