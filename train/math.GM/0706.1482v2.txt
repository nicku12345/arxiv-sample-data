A new condition called {\cal T} condition is introduced for the first time and used to study a pair of isotopic loops. Under this condition, a loop in the pair is a WIPL if and only if the other loop is a WIPL. Furthermore, such WIPLs are isomorphic. The translation elements f and g of a CIPL with the {\cal T} condition(such that its f,g-isotope is an automorphic inverse property loop) are found to be alternative, flexible, centrum and equal elements. A necessary and sufficient condition for a pair WIPLs with a weak {\cal T} condition to be isomorphic is shown. A CIPL and an isomorph are observed to have this weak {\cal T} condition.
