In this article, we will prove Riemann Hypothesis by using the mean value theorem of integrals. The function  \xi(s)  is introduced by Riemann, which zeros are identical equal to non-trivial zeros of zeta function.The function  \xi(s)  is an entire function, and its real part and imaginary part can be represented as infinite integral form. In the special condition, the mean value theorem of integrals is established for infinite integral. Using the mean value theorem of integrals and the isolation of zeros of analytic function, we determined that all zeros of the function  \xi(s)  have real part equal to\frac{1}{2}, namely, all non-trivial zeros of zeta function lies on the critical line. Riemann Hypothesis is true.
