Every quasigroup (L,\cdot) belongs to a set of 6 quasigroups, called parastrophes denoted by (L,\pi_i), i\in \{1,2,3,4,5,6\}. It is shown that (L,\pi_i) is a Smarandache quasigroup with associative subquasigroup (S,\pi_i) \forall i\in \{1,2,3,4,5,6\} if and only if for any of some four j\in \{1,2,3,4,5,6\}, (S,\pi_j) is an isotope of (S,\pi_i) or (S,\pi_k) for one k\in \{1,2,3,4,5,6\} such that i\ne j\ne k. Hence, (L,\pi_i) is a Smarandache quasigroup with associative subquasigroup (S,\pi_i) \forall i\in \{1,2,3,4,5,6\} if and only if any of the six Khalil conditions is true for any of some four of (S,\pi_i).
