The right(left) derivative, a^{-1},e- and e,a^{-1}- isotopes of a C-loop are shown to be C-loops. Furthermore, for a central loop (L,F), it is shown that \big\{F,F^{a^{-1}},F_{a^{-1},e}\big\} and \big\{F,F_{a^{-1}},F_{e,a^{-1}}\big\} are systems of isotopic C-loops that obey a form of generalized distributive law. Quasigroup isotopes (L,\otimes) and (L,\ominus) of a loop (L,\theta) and its parastrophe (L,\theta ^*) respectively are proved to be isotopic if either (L,\otimes) or (L,\ominus ) is commutative. If (L,\theta) is a C-loop, then it is shown that \big\{(L,\theta),(L,\theta ^*),(L,\otimes),(L,\oplus)\big\} is a system of isotopic C-quasigroup under the above mentioned condition. It is shown that C-loops are isotopic to some finite indecomposable groups of the classes {\cal D}_i,i=1,2,3,4,5 and that the center of such C-loops have a rank of 1,2 or 3.
