We discuss parabolic versions of Euler's identity e^{it}=cos t + i sin t. A purely algebraic approach based on dual numbers is known to produce a very trivial relation e^{pt} = 1+pt. Therefore we use a geometric setup of parabolic rotations to recover the corresponding non-trivial algebraic framework. Our main tool is Moebius transformations which turn out to be closely related to induced representations of the group SL(2,R).
