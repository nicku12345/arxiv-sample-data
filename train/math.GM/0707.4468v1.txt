The best deterministic unconditionally proven integer factorization algorithms have exponential running time complexities of O(N^(1/4)) arithmetic operations, and conditional on the Riemann hypothesis, there is a deterministic algorithm of exponential running time complexity O(N^(1/5)). This note proposes a new deterministic integer factorization algorithm of deterministic exponential time complexity O(N^(1/6)). Furthermore, an algorithm for decomposing composite integers that have factor differences of the form q - p = (r - 1)N^(1/2) + u, where r > 1 is a fixed parameter, and | u | < N^(1/3), in deterministic logarithmic time and various other results are included.
