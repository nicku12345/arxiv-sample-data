This book introduces special classes of Fuzzy and Neutrosophic matrices. These special classes of matrices are used in the construction of multi-expert special fuzzy models using FCM, FRM and FRE and their Neutorosophic analogues (simultaneous or otherwise, according to ones need). Using the six basic models, we have constructed a multi-expert multi-model called the Super Special Hexagonal Fuzzy and Neutrosophic model.   Given any special input vector, these models can give the resultant using special operations. When coupled with computer programming, these operations can give the solution within a reasonable time period. Such multi-expert multi-model systems are not only a boon to social scientists, but also to anyone who wants to use Fuzzy or Neutrosophic models.
