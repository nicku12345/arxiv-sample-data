In this work we use the number classification in families of the form 6n+1, and 6n+5 with n integer (Such families contain all odd prime numbers greater than 3 and other compound numbers related with primes). We will use this kind of classification in order to attempt an approach to Goldbach strong conjecture. By means of a geometric method of binary bands of numbers we conceive a new form of study of the stated problem.
