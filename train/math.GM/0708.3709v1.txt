In this paper we review the properties of families of numbers of the form 6n\pm1, with n integer (in which there are all prime numbers greater than 3 and other compound numbers with particular properties) to later use them in a new sieve that allows the separation of numbers n that generate primes from those that only generate compounds. In principle, this can be used to find the amount of prime numbers up to a given number h; this means, \pi(h).
