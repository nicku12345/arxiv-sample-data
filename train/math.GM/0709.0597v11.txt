In this note, we review the notion of Painlev\'e scheme of the sixth Painlev\'e equation from the viewpoint of accessible singular point and its local index in the Hirzebruch surface of degree two {\Sigma_2}. The key method is Painlev\'e \alpha-method for each accessible singular point. Giving a Painlev\'e scheme in the differential system satisfying certain conditions, we can recover the Painlev\'e VI system with the polynomial Hamiltonian. We also consider the case of the Painlev\'e V,IV and III systems, respectively. Finally, we study non-linear ordinary differential systems in dimension two with only simple accessible singular (n+2)-points in the Hirzebruch surface of degree n; {\Sigma_n}. This equation has symmetry of symmetric group of degree n+2.
