Not any geometry can be axiomatized. The paradoxical Godel's theorem starts from the supposition that any geometry can be axiomatized and goes to the result, that not any geometry can be axiomatized. One considers example of two close geometries (Riemannian geometry and \sigma -Riemannian one), which are constructed by different methods and distinguish in some details. The Riemannian geometry reminds such a geometry, which is only a part of the full geometry. Such a possibility is covered by the Godel's theorem.
