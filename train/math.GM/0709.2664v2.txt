A quantum theory representations of real (R) and complex (C) numbers is given that is based on states of single, finite strings of qukits for any base k > 1. Both unary representations and the possibility that qukits with k a prime number are elementary and the rest composite are discussed. Cauchy sequences of qukit string states are defined from the arithmetic properties. The representations of R and C, as equivalence classes of these sequences, differ from classical kit string state representations in two ways: the freedom of choice of basis states, and the fact that each quantum theory representation is part of a mathematical structure that is itself based on the real and complex numbers. These aspects enable the description of 3 dimensional frame fields labeled by different k values, different basis or gauge choices, and different iteration stages. The reference frames in the field are based on each R and C representation where each frame contains representations of all physical theories as mathematical structures based on the R and C representation. Approaches to integrating this with physics are described. It is observed that R and C values of physical quantities, matrix elements, etc. which are viewed in a frame as elementary and featureless, are seen in a parent frame as equivalence classes of Cauchy sequences of qukit string states.
