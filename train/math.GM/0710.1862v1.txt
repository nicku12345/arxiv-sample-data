A folklore proof of Euclid's theorem on the infinitude of primes uses the Euler product and the irrationality of \zeta(2) = \pi^2/6. A quantified form of Euclid's Theorem is Bertrand's postulate p_{n+1} < 2p_n. By quantifying the folklore proof using an irrationality measure for 6/\pi^2, we give a proof (communicated to Paulo Ribenboim in 2005) of a much weaker upper bound on p_{n+1}.
