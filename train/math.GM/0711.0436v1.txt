In recent Kwasniewski's papers inspired by O. V. Viskov it was shown that the \psi-calculus in parts appears to be almost automatic, natural extension of classical operator calculus of Rota - Mullin or equivalently - of umbral calculus of Roman and Rota. At the same time this calculus is an example of the algebraization of the analysis - here restricted to the algebra of polynomials. The first part of the article is the review of the recent author's contribution. The main definitions and theorems of Finite Fibonomial   Operator Calculus which is a special case of \psi-extented Rota's finite operator calculus are presented there. In the second part the characterization of Fibonacci Cobweb poset P as DAG and oDAG is given. The dim 2 poset such that its Hasse diagram coincide with digraf of P is constructed.
