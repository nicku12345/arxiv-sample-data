We revise the notion of the quasi-sectorial contractions. Our main theorem establishes a relation between semigroups of quasi-sectorial contractions and a class of m-sectorial generators. We discuss a relevance of this kind of contractions to the theory of operator-norm approximations of strongly continuous semigroups.
