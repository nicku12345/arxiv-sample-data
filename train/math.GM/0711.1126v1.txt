Using the concepts of Hyperbolic Classification of Natural Numbers, Essential Regions and Goldbach Conjecture Function we prove that the existence of a proof of the Goldbach Conjecture in First-Order Arithmetic would imply the existence of another proof in a certain extension that would not be valid in all states of time associated to natural numbers created by means of adequate dynamic processes.
