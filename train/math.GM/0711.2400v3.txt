To constitute atoms of a \sigma algebra is not a easy task due to the large number of its elements. However, determining them via generators seems a feasible and simple way since most \sigma algebras are generated by their smaller proper subsets. Precisely, under some conditions each atom of a \sigma algebra equals the intersection of the elements containing a point of the atom in the generator. In this paper, a very weak sufficient condition for determining atoms by the generator is presented. The condition, though not being a necessary one, is shown to be almost the weakest one in the sense that it can hardly be improved.
