We described a wide class of p-adic refinable equations generating p-adic multiresolution analysis. A method for the construction of p-adic orthogonal wavelet bases within the framework of the MRA theory is suggested. A realization of this method is illustrated by an example, which gives a new 3-adic wavelet basis. Another realization leads to the p-adic Haar bases which were known before.
