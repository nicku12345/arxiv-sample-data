A new form of governing equations is derived from Hamilton's principle of least action for a constrained Lagrangian, depending on conserved quantities and their derivatives with respect to the time-space. This form yields conservation laws both for non-dispersive case (Lagrangian depends only on conserved quantities) and dispersive case (Lagrangian depends also on their derivatives). For non-dispersive case the set of conservation laws allows to rewrite the governing equations in the symmetric form of Godunov-Friedrichs-Lax. The linear stability of equilibrium states for potential motions is also studied. In particular, the dispersion relation is obtained in terms of Hermitian matrices both for non-dispersive and dispersive case. Some new results are extended to the two-fluid non-dispersive case.
