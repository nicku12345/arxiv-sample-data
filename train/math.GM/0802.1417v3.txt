The present study further strengthens the use of the Keedwell CIPQ against attack on a system by the use of the Smarandache Keedwell CIPQ for cryptography in a similar spirit in which the cross inverse property has been used by Keedwell. This is done as follows. By constructing two S-isotopic S-quasigroups(loops) U and V such that their Smarandache automorphism groups are not trivial, it is shown that U is a SCIPQ(SCIPL) if and only if V is a SCIPQ(SCIPL). Explanations and procedures are given on how these SCIPQs can be used to double encrypt information.
