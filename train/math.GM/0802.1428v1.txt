The present study further strenghtens the use of the Keedwell CIPQ against attack on a system. This is done as follows. The holomorphic structure of AIPQs(AIPLs) and CIPQs(CIPLs) are investigated. Necessary and sufficient conditions for the holomorph of a quasigroup(loop) to be an AIPQ(AIPL) or CIPQ(CIPL) are established. It is shown that if the holomorph of a quasigroup(loop) is a AIPQ(AIPL) or CIPQ(CIPL), then the holomorph is isomorphic to the quasigroup(loop). Hence, the holomorph of a quasigroup(loop) is an AIPQ(AIPL) or CIPQ(CIPL) if and only if its automorphism group is trivial and the quasigroup(loop) is a AIPQ(AIPL) or CIPQ(CIPL). Furthermore, it is discovered that if the holomorph of a quasigroup(loop) is a CIPQ(CIPL), then the quasigroup(loop) is a flexible unipotent CIPQ(flexible CIPL of exponent 2). By constructing two isotopic quasigroups(loops) U and V such that their automorphism groups are not trivial, it is shown that U is a AIPQ or CIPQ(AIPL or CIPL) if and only if V is a AIPQ or CIPQ(AIPL or CIPL). Explanations and procedures are given on how these CIPQs can be used to double encrypt information.
