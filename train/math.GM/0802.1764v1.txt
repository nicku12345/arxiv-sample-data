The transformations of the sum identities for generalized harmonic and oscillatory numbers, obtained earlier in our recent report [1], enable us to derive the new identities expressed in terms of the corresponding square roots of x. At least one of these identities may be applied to prove the Riemann Hypothesis by induction. Additionally using this approach, the new series for Euler's constant gamma has been found.
