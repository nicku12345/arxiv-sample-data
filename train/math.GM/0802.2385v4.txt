The paper deals with \Sigma-composition of terms, which allows us to extend the derivation rules in formal deduction of identities.   The concept of essential variables and essential positions of terms with respect to a set of identities is a key step in the simplification of the process of formal deduction. \Sigma-composition of terms is defined as replacement between \Sigma-equal terms. This composition induces \Sigma R-deductively closed sets of identities. In analogy to balanced identities we introduce and investigate \Sigma-balanced identities for a given set of identities \Sigma.
