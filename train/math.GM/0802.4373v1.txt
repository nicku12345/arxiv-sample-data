This article presents extensions of the Cram{\'e}r-Wold theorem to measures that may have infinite mass near the origin. Corresponding results for sequences of measures are presented together with examples showing that the assumptions imposed are sharp. The extensions build on a number of results and methods concerned with injectivity properties of the Radon transform. Using a few tools from distribution theory and Fourier analysis we show that the presented injectivity results for the Radon transform lead to Cram{\'e}r-Wold type results for measures. One purpose of this article is to contribute to making known to probabilists interesting results for the Radon transform that have been developed essentially during the 1980ies and 1990ies.
