Before we dive into the accessibility stream of nowadays indicatory applications of octonions to computer and other sciences and to quantum physics let us focus for a while on the crucially relevant events for todays revival on interest to nonassociativity. Our reflections keep wandering back to the Brahmagupta Fibonacc two square identity and then via the Euler four square identity up to the Degen Ggraves Cayley eight square identity. These glimpses of history incline and invite us to retell the story on how about one month after quaternions have been carved on the Broughamian bridge octonions were discovered by John Thomas Ggraves, jurist and mathematician, a friend of William Rowan Hamilton. As for today we just mention en passant quaternionic and octonionic quantum mechanics, generalization of Cauchy Riemann equations for octonions and triality principle and G_2 group in spinor language in a descriptive way in order not to daunt non specialists. Relation to finite geometries is recalled and the links to the 7stones of seven sphere, seven imaginary octonions units in out of the Plato cave reality applications are appointed . This way we are welcomed back to primary ideas of Heisenberg, Wheeler and other distinguished fathers of quantum mechanics and quantum gravity foundations.
