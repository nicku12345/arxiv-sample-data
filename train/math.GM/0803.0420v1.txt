We present in this work a heuristic expression for the density of prime numbers. Our expression leads to results which possesses approximately the same precision of the Riemann's function in the domain that goes from 2 to 1010 at least. Instead of using a constant as was done by Legendre and others in the formula of Gauss, we try to adjust the data through a function. This function has the remarkable property: its points of discontinuity are the prime numbers.
