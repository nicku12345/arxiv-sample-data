In this first part of a larger review undertaking the results of the first author and a part of the second author doctor dissertation are presented. Next we plan to give a survey of a nowadays situation in the area of investigation. Here we report on what follows.   Calculation of the partition function for any vector potts model is at first reduced to the calculation of traces of products of the generalized clifford algebra generators. The formula for such traces is derived. This enables one, in principle, to use an explicit calculation algorithm for partition functions also in other models for which the transfer matrix is an element from generalized clifford algebra. The method - simple for Z_2 case - becomes complicated for Z_n, n>2, however everything is controlled, in principle, due to knowledge of the corresponding algebra properties and those of generalized cosh function. The discussion of the content of the in statu nascendi second part is to be found at the end of this presentation. This constitutes the last section.
