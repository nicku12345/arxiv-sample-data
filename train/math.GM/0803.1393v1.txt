A research problem for undergraduates and graduates is being posed as a cap for the prior antecedent regular discrete mathematics exercises. [Here cap is not necessarily CAP=Competitive Access Provider, though nevertheless ...] The object of the cap problem of final interest i.e. array of fibonomial coefficients and the issue of its combinatorial meaning is to be found in A.K.Kwa\'sniewski's source papers. The cap problem number seven - still opened for students has been placed on Mathemagics page of the first author [http://ii.uwb.edu.pl/akk/dydaktyka/dyskr/dyskretna.htm]. The indicatory references are to point at a part of the vast domain of the foundations of computer science in ArXiv affiliation noted as CO.cs.DM. The presentation has been verified in a tutor system of communication with a couple of intelligent students. The result is top secret.Temporarily.
