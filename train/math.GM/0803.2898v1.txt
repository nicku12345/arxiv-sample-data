A recent paper proposing a model of the limiting speed of the domino effect is discussed with reference to its need and the need of models in general for validation against experimental data. It is shown that the proposed model diverges significantly from experimentally derived speed estimates over a significant range of domino spacing using data from the existing literature and this author's own measurements, hence if its use had had economic importance its use outside its range of validity could have led to loses of one sort or another to its users.
