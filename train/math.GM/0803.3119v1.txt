Considered will be properties of the set of real numbers \Re generated by an operator that has form of an exponential function of Gelfond-Schneider type with rational arguments. It will be shown that such created set has cardinal number equal to {\aleph_0}^{\aleph_0}=c. It will be also shown that the same set is countable. The implication of this contradiction to the countability of the set of real numbers will be discussed.
