In this paper we present a decision procedure for computing pFq hypergeometric solutions for third order linear ODEs, that is, solutions for the classes of hypergeometric equations constructed from the 3F2, 2F2, 1F2 and 0F2 standard equations using transformations of the form {x -> F(x), y -> P(x) y}, where F(x) is rational in x and P(x) is arbitrary. A computer algebra implementation of this work is present in Maple 12.
