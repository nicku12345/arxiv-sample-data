There are four characteristic circles for each triangle on a plane. All for are tangential to the three straight lines containing the triangles' three sides. Three are exterior circles, the fourth is the in-circle. When the triangle is Pythagorean, the four diameters are integers. Consider a Pythagorean triangle with the property that one leglength is a perfect(or integer)square, and with one of the four diameters also a integer square.Of the eight resulting combinations, we prove that only six are possible or can occur. We then completely parametrically describe the six families; each corresponding to one of the six combinations.
