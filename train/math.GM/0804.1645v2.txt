Following the definition of intuitionistic fuzzy n-norm [ 3 ], we have introduced the definition of intuitionistic fuzzy norm (in short IFN) over a linear space and there after a few results on intuitionistic fuzzy normed linear space and finite dimensional intuitionistic fuzzy normed linear space. Lastly, we have introduced the definitions of intuitionistic fuzzy continuity and sequentially intuitionistic fuzzy continuity and proved that they are equivalen
