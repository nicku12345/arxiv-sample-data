The first part of this paper defines recursive interactions by means of logistic functions and derives a general result on the way interacting systems evolve in attractors. It also defines the notion of coevolution trajectory and presents a new family of attractors: orbital attractors (including single, irregular, folded, complex and discontinuous orbits). The second part summarizes the results of a first experimental analysis of recursive interactions in both binary and multiple interactions. Among other results, this analysis reveals that interacting systems may easily evolve from chaos to order.
