The concept of Smarandache Bryant Schneider Group of a Smarandache loop is introduced. Relationship(s) between the Bryant Schneider Group and the Smarandache Bryant Schneider Group of an S-loop are discovered and the later is found to be useful in finding Smarandache isotopy-isomorphy condition(s) in S-loops just like the formal is useful in finding isotopy-isomorphy condition(s) in loops. Some properties of the Bryant Schneider Group of a loop are shown to be true for the Smarandache Bryant Schneider Group of a Smarandache loop. Some interesting and useful cardinality formulas are also established for a type of finite Smarandache loop.
