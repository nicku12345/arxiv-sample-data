Limit can be defined by two axioms: 1. Strict inequality between limits implies, ultimately, strict inequality between functions. 2. For constant functions limit is trivial.   How can basic results on convergence be derived from these axioms? In this paper we propose two answers: a) at the most elementary level- add two more axioms, b) at somewhat higher level, do it in three steps, and, in our forthcoming paper "Axiomatic definition of limit", a third answer- c) do it neater - in an abstract framework, where only order relations are present.
