P. J. Kelly conjectured in 1968 that every diregular tournament on (2n+1) points can be decomposed in directed Hamilton circuits [1]. We define so called leading diregular tournament on (2n+1) points and show that it can be decomposed in directed Hamilton circuits when (2n+1) is a prime number. When (2n+1) is not a prime number this method does not work and we will need to devise some another method. We also propose a general method to find Hamilton decomposition of certain tournament for all sizes.
