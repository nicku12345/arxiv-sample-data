The main objective of this dissertation is to present an adaptation of some finite volume methods used in the resolution of problems arising in sedimentation processes of flocculated suspensions (or sedimentation with compression).   This adaptation is based on the utilization of multiresolution techniques, originally designed to reduce the computational cost incurred in solving using high resolution schemes in the numerical solution of hyperbolic systems of conservation laws.
