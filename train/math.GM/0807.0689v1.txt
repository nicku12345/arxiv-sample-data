In this paper we study the distribution of stacks in k-noncrossing, \tau-canonical RNA pseudoknot structures (<k,\tau> -structures). An RNA structure is called k-noncrossing if it has no more than k-1 mutually crossing arcs and \tau-canonical if each arc is contained in a stack of length at least \tau. Based on the ordinary generating function of <k,\tau>-structures \cite{Reidys:08ma} we derive the bivariate generating function {\bf T}_{k,\tau}(x,u)=\sum_{n \geq 0} \sum_{0\leq t \leq \frac{n}{2}} {\sf T}_{k, \tau}^{} (n,t) u^t x^n, where {\sf T}_{k,\tau}(n,t) is the number of <k,\tau>-structures having exactly t stacks and study its singularities. We show that for a certain parametrization of the variable u, {\bf T}_{k,\tau}(x,u) has a unique, dominant singularity. The particular shift of this singularity parametrized by u implies a central limit theorem for the distribution of stack-numbers. Our results are of importance for understanding the ``language'' of minimum-free energy RNA pseudoknot structures, generated by computer folding algorithms.
