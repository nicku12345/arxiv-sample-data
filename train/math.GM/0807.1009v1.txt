These notes develop aspects of perturbation theory of matrices related to so-called diagonalisation schemes. Primary focus is on constructive tools to derive asymptotic expansions for small/large parameters of eigenvalues and eigenprojections of families of matrices depending upon real/complex parameters.   Applications of the schemes in different frameworks --including hyperbolic polynomials, asymptotic integration of ordinary differential equations, diagonalisation within symbolic hierarchies and pseudo-differential decoupling of hyperbolic-parabolic coupled systems-- are also discussed and references to further applications given.
