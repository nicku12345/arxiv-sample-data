In the early part of the paper, various geometrical formulas are derived. Then, at some point in the paper, the concept of a Pythagorean rational is introduced. A Pythagorean rational is a rational number which is the ratio of two integers which are the leglengths of a Pythagorean triangle. Using the idea of Pythagorean rationals, we generate two families of rational triangles. We define a rational triangle to be a triangle with rational sidelengths and area.
