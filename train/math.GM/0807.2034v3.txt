One considers geometry with the intransitive equaivalence relation. Such a geometry is a physical geometry, i.e. it is described completely by the world function, which is a half of the squared distance function. The physical geometry cannot be axiomatized, in general. It is obtained as a result of deformation of the proper Euclidean geometry. Class of physical geometries is more powerful, than the class of axiomatized geometries. The physical geometry admits one to describe such geometric properties as discreteness, granularity and limited divisibility. These properties are important in application to the space-time. They admits one to explain the discrimination properties of the space-time, which generate discrete parameters of elementary particles. Mathematical formalism of a physical geometry is very simple. The physical geometry is formulated in geometrical terms (in terms of points and world function) without a use of means of description (coordinate system, space dimension, manifold, etc.).
