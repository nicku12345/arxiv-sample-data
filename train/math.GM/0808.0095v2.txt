The group invariance of entanglement is obtained within a very general and simple setup of the latter, given by a recently introduced considerably extended concept of tensor products. This general approach to entanglement - unlike the usual one given in the particular setup of tensor products of vector spaces - turns out not to need any specific algebraic structure. The resulting advantage is that, entanglement being in fact defined by a negation, its presence in a general setup increases the chances of its manifestations, thus also its availability as a resource.
