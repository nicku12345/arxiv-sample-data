We give a brief overview of a few criteria equivalent to the Riemann Hypothesis. Next we concentrate on the Riesz and B{\'a}ez-Duarte criteria. We proof that they are equivalent and we provide some computer data to support them. It is not compressed to six pages version of the talk delivered by M.W. during the XXVII Workshop on Geometrical Methods in Physics, 28 June -- 6 July, 2008, Bia{\l}owie{\.z}a, Poland.
