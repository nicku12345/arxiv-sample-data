This is an exhaustive study of the seventeen elements of Pythagorean triangles, from the point of view of when such an element is an irrational number, a rational number, or an integer. For each of these 17 elements,precice conditions for their integrality,rationality, or irrationality; are given. These 17 elements are:The radius of the incircle, the radius of the circumscribed circle,the three radii of the three exterior circles tangential to the three lines containing the triangles'sides, the lengths of the three heights, the lenghts of the three internal angle bisectors, the lengthe of the three external angle bisectors, and the lengths of the three medians.
