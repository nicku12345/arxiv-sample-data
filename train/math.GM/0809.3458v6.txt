Let p_{k} denote the k-th prime and d(p_{k}) = p_{k} - p_{k - 1}, the difference between consecutive primes. We denote by N_{\epsilon}(x) the number of primes \leq x which satisfy the inequality d(p_{k}) \leq (\log p_{k})^{2 + \epsilon}, where \epsilon > 0 is arbitrary and fixed, and by \pi(x) the number of primes less than or equal to x. In this paper, we first prove a theorem that \lim_{x \to \infty} N_{\epsilon}(x)/\pi(x) = 1. A corollary to the proof of the theorem concerning gaps between consecutive squarefree numbers is stated.
