Numbers (positive integers) are the most fundamental creatures of the human mind and the foundation to the scientific understanding of nature. Some mathematicians have suspected a link between prime numbers and secrets of creation. Understanding creativity may help resolve the deepest mysteries of primes. The algorithm that programs the mind and makes the mind creative must be sufficient for the mind to create primes. I found that primes are directly linked to the creation algorithm of the mind. The essence of primes is the duality of uniqueness and uniformity together with the creation algorithm of the mind. The creative process of the mind is lawfully determined but the outcome is unpredictable. The mathematical equivalent or model of this process is the creation of primes. Primes have the inherent property of unpredictability but can be generated by the creation algorithm of the mind, termed the Prime Law, via a fully deterministic lawful process. This new understanding of the essence of primes can deduce some of the best-known properties of primes, including the Riemann Hypothesis (RH). Understanding human creativity is obviously the most fundamental of all scientific enquiries. That this understanding can directly lead to a solution to the RH, widely considered the most important unsolved problem in mathematics, shows a deep connection between creativity and mathematics.
