The Riemann hypothesis is equivalent to the \varpi-form of the prime number theorem as \varpi(x) =O(x\sp{1/2} \log\sp{2} x), where \varpi(x) =\sum\sb{n\le x}\ \bigl(\Lambda(n) -1\big) with the sum running through the set of all natural integers. Let {\mathsf Z}(s) = -\tfrac{\zeta\sp{\prime}(s)}{\zeta(s)} -\zeta(s). We use the classical integral formula for the Heaviside function in the form of {\mathsf H}(x) =\int\sb{m -i\infty} \sp{m +i\infty} \tfrac{x\sp{s}}{s} \dd s where m >0, and {\mathsf H}(x) is 0 when \tfrac{1}{2} <x <1, \tfrac{1}{2} when x=1, and 1 when x >1. However, we diverge from the literature by applying Cauchy's residue theorem to the function {\mathsf Z}(s) \cdot \tfrac{x\sp{s}} {s}, rather than -\tfrac{\zeta\sp{\prime}(s)} {\zeta(s)} \cdot \tfrac{x\sp{s}}{s}, so that we may utilize the formula for \tfrac{1}{2}< m <1, under certain conditions. Starting with the estimate on \varpi(x) from the trivial zero-free region \sigma >1 of {\mathsf Z}(s), we use induction to reduce the size of the exponent \theta in \varpi(x) =O(x\sp{\theta} \log\sp{2} x), while we also use induction on x when \theta is fixed. We prove that the Riemann hypothesis is valid under the assumptions of the explicit strong density hypothesis and the Lindel\"of hypothesis recently proven, via a result of the implication on the zero free regions from the remainder terms of the prime number theorem by the power sum method of Tur\'an.
