The Riemann hypothesis, conjectured by Bernhard Riemann in 1859, claims that the non-trivial zeros of \zeta(s) lie on the line \Re(s) =1/2. The density hypothesis is a conjectured estimate N(\lambda, T) =O\bigl(T\sp{2(1-\lambda) +\epsilon} \bigr) for any \epsilon >0, where N(\lambda, T) is the number of zeros of \zeta(s) when \Re(s) \ge\lambda and 0 <\Im(s) \le T, with 1/2 \le \lambda \le 1 and T >0. The Riemann-von Mangoldt Theorem confirms this estimate when \lambda =1/2, with T\sp{\epsilon} being replaced by \log T. In an attempt to transform Backlund's proof of the Riemann-von Mangoldt Theorem to a proof of the density hypothesis by convexity, we discovered a different approach utilizing an auxiliary function. The crucial point is that this function should be devised to be symmetric with respect to \Re(s) =1/2 and about the size of the Euler Gamma function on the right hand side of the line \Re(s) =1/2. Moreover, it should be analytic and without any zeros in the concerned region. We indeed found such a function, which we call pseudo-Gamma function. With its help, we are able to establish a proof of the density hypothesis. Actually, we give the result explicitly and our result is even stronger than the original density hypothesis, namely it yields N(\lambda, T) \le 8.734 \log T for any 1/2 < \lambda < 1 and T\ge 2445999554999.
