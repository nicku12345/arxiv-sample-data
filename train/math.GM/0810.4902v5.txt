In order to estimate the average speed of mosquitoes, a simple experiment was designed by Richard (Lu-Hsing Tsai), Tom (Po-Yu Tsai) and Robert (Hung-Ming Tsai). The result of the experiment was posted in the science exhibitions Taichung Taiwan 1993. The average speed of mosquitoes is inferred by the simple relation that is obtained easily. In this paper, we will show how the data generated by computer. Though the rigorous proof is not shown, a sketch proof will be shown in this paper. There are five figures one table and one fortran computer source program in the end of the paper.
