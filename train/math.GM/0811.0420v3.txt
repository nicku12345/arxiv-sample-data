The eventological theory of decision-making, the theory of eventfull decision-making is a theory of decision-making based on eventological principles and using results of mathematical eventology; a theoretical basis of the practical eventology. The beginnings of this theory which have arisen from eventfull representation of the reasonable subject and his decisions in the form of eventological distributions (E-distributions) of sets of events and which are based on the eventological H-theorem are offered. The illustrative example of the eventological decision-making by the reasonable subject on his own eventfull behaviour in the financial or share market is considered.
