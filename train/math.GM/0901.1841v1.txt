We study few properties of square-free integers in certain equations. Using this property, we derive some infinite products in powers of square free numbers. Also, we present a method, to convert power series and trigonometric series to infinte products. Infinite products of few elementary trigonometric functions and factorials for large numbers are shown as examples.
