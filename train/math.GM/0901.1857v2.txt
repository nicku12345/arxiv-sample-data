In this work, we prove that any triangle whose three sidelengths are integers, cannot have all of its three medians also having integral lengths.This is done in Proposition 2.In Section 5, we give precise(i.e.necessary and sufficient)conditions for a nonisosceles, integer-sided triangle to have two integral medians.In Section 3, we offer parametric descriptions of three special families of integer-sided triangles.The first family consists of all Pythagorean triangles whose medians to their hypotenuses is integral. The other two medians (to the two legs)of any Pythagorean triangle are irrational, a proof of this fact can be found in reference 4 of this paper.The second family consists of all integer-sided isosceles triangles, whose only integral median is the one contained between the two sides of equal length. Finally, the third family consists of all isosceles integer-sided triangles with the two medians of equal length;having integer length.
