In this article, we first give a proof on the Arnold chord conjecture which states that every Reeb flow has at least as many Reeb chords as a smooth function on the Legendre submanifold has critical points on contact manifold. Second, we prove that every Reeb flow has at least as many close Reeb orbits as a smooth round function on the close contact manifold has critical circles on contact manifold. This also implies a proof on the fact that there exists at least number n close Reeb orbits on close (2n-1)-dimensional convex hypersurface in R^{2n} conjectured by Ekeland.
