Based on Euclid's algorithm, we find a kind of special sequences which play an interesting role in the study of primes. We call them W Sequences. They not only ties up the distribution of primes in short interval but also enables us to give new weakened forms of many classical problems in Number Theory. The object of this paper is to provide a brief introduction and preliminary analysis on this kind of special sequences.
