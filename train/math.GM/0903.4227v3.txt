Using the \zeta functional equation and the Hadamard product, an analytical expression for the sum of the reciprocal of the \zeta zeros is established. We then demonstrate that on the critical line, |\zeta| is convex, and that in the region 0 < \Re(s) \leq 0.5, |\zeta| has a negative slope, given the RH. In each case, analytical formulae are established, and numerical examples are presented to validate these formulae.
