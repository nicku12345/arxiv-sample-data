Polignac [1] conjectured that for every even natural number 2k (k\geq1), there exist infinitely many consecutive primes p_n and p_{n+1} such that p_{n+1}-p_n=2k. A weakened form of this conjecture states that for every k\geq1, there exist infinitely many primes p and q such that p-q=2k. Clearly, the weakened form of Polignac's conjecture implies that there exists an infinite sequence of positive integers x_1,x_2,...,x_m,... such that x_1 (2k+x_1),x_2 (2k+x_2),...,x_m (2k+x_m)... are pairwise relatively prime. In this note, we obtain a slightly stronger result than this necessary condition. This enables us to find a common property on some special kinds of number-theoretic functions (such as 2^x -1 ) which likely represent infinitely many primes by rich literatures and a lot of research reports. However, the function 2^{2^x}+1 does not have this property. Does it imply that the number of Fermat primes is finite? Hardy and Wright [7] conjectured that the number of Fermat primes is finite. Nevertheless, they did not give any reasons and explanations. By factoring Fermat number, many people believe that the conjecture in [7] holds. Does our work explain this phenomenon? We will consider further this problem in another paper. Based on our work, one could give a new sufficient condition that there are an infinite number of twin primes (Sophie-Germain primes or Mersenne primes).
