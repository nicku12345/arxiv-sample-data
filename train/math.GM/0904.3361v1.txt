Contemporary geometers do not acknowledge nonaxomatizable geometries. This fact means that our knowledge of geometry is poor. A perfect knowledge of geometry is important for "consumers of geometry" (physicists dealing with geometry of microcosm), because poor knowledge of geometry forces physicists to refuse from the orthodox geometrical paradigm and to use the quantum paradigm, which is a simple fitting, compensating our imperfect knowledge of geometry.
