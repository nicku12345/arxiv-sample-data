In this paper paraconsistent second order arithmetic Z#2 with unrestricted comprehension scheme is proposed. We outline the development of certain portions of paraconsistent mathematics within paraconsistent second order arithmetic Z#2.In particular we defined infinite hierarchy Berry's and Richard's inconsistent numbers as elements of the paraconsistent field R^#.
