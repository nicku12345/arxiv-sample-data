In this work we present a proof to the celebrated Riemann hypothesis. In it we first apply the Plancherel theorem and properties of the M\"obius function \mu(n) to the Fourier series expansions for the periodic Bernoulli polynomials to prove that \sum_{n\ge N+1}\frac{\mu(n)}{n^{4}}=\mathcal{O}\left(N^{-7/2+\epsilon}\right). But this alone is not strong enough to prove the Riemann hypothesis directly. In the next step we apply the analytical properties of the Riemann Xi function to reduce the Riemann hypothesis to the proofs of two integrals I_{1},\,I_{2} having limit zero. The treatment of I_{1}, which is an integral with upper limit +\infty, is straightforward, we can show it tends to 0 by applying a well-known inequality for the Jacobi theta function \theta_{3}. There are subtle cancellations in the second integral I_{2}, which has lower integration limit -\infty, they are mainly from the the arithmetical properties of \mu(n). Fortunately, our asymptotic formula has captured enough of them to show that I_{2} tends to 0 as well.
