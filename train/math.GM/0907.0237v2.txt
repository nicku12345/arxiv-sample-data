We present a simple set-theoretic proof of the Banach-Stone Theorem .We thus apply this Topological classification theorem to the still unsolved problem of topological classification of euclidean manifolds through two conjectures and additionally we give a straightforward proof of the famous Brower theorem for Manifolds topologically classified by their euclidean dimensions.
