In this paper possible completion ^*R_{d} of the Robinson non-archimedean field ^*R constructed by Dedekind sections. Given an class of analytic functions of one complex variable f \in C[[z]],we investigate the arithmetic nature of the values of f at transcendental points e^{n}. Main results are: 1) the both numbers e+\pi and e\pi are irrational, 2) number e^{e} is transcendental. Nontrivial generalization of the Lindemann-Weierstrass theorem is obtained
