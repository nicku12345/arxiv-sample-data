F.: Good morning Hermann, I would like to talk with you about infinitesimals.   G.: Tell me Pierre.   F.: I'm fed up of all these slanders about my attitude to be non rigorous, so I've started to study nonstandard analysis (NSA) and synthetic differential geometry (SDG).   G.: Yes, I've read something ...   F.: Ok, no problem about their rigour. But, when I've seen that the sine of an infinite in NSA is infinitely near to a real number I was astonished: what is the intuitive meaning of this number, if any? Then, I've seen that to work in SDG I must learn to work in intuitionistic logic ... You know, I love margins of books, and I don't want to loose too much time, I have many things to do ...   G.: In SDG they also say that every infinitesimal is at the same time positive and negative, what is the meaning of all these? And why does the square of a first order infinitesimal equal zero, whereas the product of two first order infinitesimals is not necessarily zero? And do you know that from any single infinitesimal in NSA is possible to construct a non measurable set? Without using the axiom of choice!   F.: Yes, I know, I know ... Ok, listen: why cannot we start from standard real functions of one real variable and use ...   This work is the ideal continuation of this dialogue: a theory of actual infinitesimals that do not need a background of formal logic to be understood, with a clear intuitive meaning and with non trivial applications to differential geometry of both finite and infinite dimensional spaces.
