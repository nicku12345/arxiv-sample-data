For any s \in \mathbb{C} with \Re(s)>0, denote by S_n(s) the n^{th} partial sum of the alternating Dirichlet series 1-2^{-s}+3^{-s}-...  . We first show that S_n(s)\neq 0 for all n greater than some index N(s) . Denoting by D={s \in \mathbb{C}:   0< \Re(s) < {1/2}} the open left half of the critical strip, define for all s\in D and n>N(s) the ratio P_n(s) = S_n(1-s) / S_n(s) . We then prove that the limit L(s)=\lim_{N(s)<n\to\infty}P_n(s) exists at every point s of the domain D . Finally, we show that the function L(s) is continuous on D if and only if the Riemann Hypothesis is true.
