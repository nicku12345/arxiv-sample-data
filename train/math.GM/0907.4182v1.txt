Some ratio estimators for estimating the population mean of the variable under study, which make use of information regarding the population proportion possessing certain attribute, are proposed. Under simple random sampling without replacement (SRSWOR) scheme, the expressions of bias and mean-squared error (MSE) up to the first order of approximation are derived. The results obtained have been illustrated numerically by taking some empirical population considered in the literature.
