Throughout this article the major idea and conclusion is about comparing this method with some very famous methods like fourier series and wavelet, to show that the power of this approximation method is as much as to predicate many natural and finance methods, something which we can not say the same for wavelets and Fourier series, since this method consider the function itself to make the base functions, and it is more natural rather than wavelets method and fourier series, which they consider some prior functions as basis.
