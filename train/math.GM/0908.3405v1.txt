Step by step a substitution of the well known Brouwer choice sequence will be constructed. It begins with an establishing of quasi alternating prime number series followed by a construction of a virtual sequence in sense of the virtual set definition. The last step gives reasons for why this virtual sequence substitutes the choice sequence created by L. E. J. Brouwer.
