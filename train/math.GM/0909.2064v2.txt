In this note, we generalize an ancient Greek inequality about the sequence of primes to the cases of arithmetic progressions even multivariable polynomials with integral coefficients. We also refine Bouniakowsky's conjecture [16] and Conjecture 2 in [22]. Moreover, we give two remarks on conjectures in [22]
