The presence of infinitesimals is traced back to some of the most general algebraic structures, namely, semigroups, and in fact, magmas, [1], in which none of the structures of linear order, field, or the Archimedean property need to be present. Such a clarification of the basic structures from where infinitesimals can in fact emerge may prove to have a special importance in Physics, as seen in [4-16]. The relevance of the deeper and simpler roots of infinitesimals, as they are given in Definitions 3.1 and 3.2, is shown by the close connection in Theorem 4.1 and Corollary 4.1 between the presence of infinitesimals and the non-Archimedean property, in the particular case of linearly ordered monoids, a case which, however, has a wide applicative interest.
