In this note, we derive non trivial sharp bounds related to the weighted harmonic-geometric-arithmetic means inequalities, when two out of the three terms are known. As application, we give an explicit bound for the trace of the inverse of a symmetric positive definite matrix and an inequality related to the coefficients of polynomials with positive roots.
