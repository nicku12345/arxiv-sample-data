In this paper we are going to describe the results of the computer experiment, which in principle can rule out the Riemann Hypothesis. We use the sequence c_k appearing in the \BD criterion for the RH. Namely we calculate c_{100000} with thousand digits of accuracy using two different formulas for c_k with the aim to disproof the Riemann Hypothesis in the case these two numbers will differ. We found the discrepancy only on the 996 decimal place (accuracy of 10^{-996}). The reported here experiment can be of interest for developers of Mathematica and PARI/GP.
