This paper is a continuation of [1], in which I studied Harvey Friedman's problem of whether the function f(x,y) = x^2 + y^3 satisfies any identities; however, no knowledge of [1] is necessary to understand this paper. We will break the exponential Diophantine equation 2^a3^b + 2^c3^d = 2^e3^f + 2^g3^h into subcases that are easier to analyze. Then we will solve an equation obtained by imposing a restriction on one of these subcases, after which we will solve a generalization of this equation.
