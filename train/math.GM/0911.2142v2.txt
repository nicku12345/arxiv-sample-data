By definition, transverse intersections are stable under infinitesimal perturbations. Using persistent homology, we extend this notion to a measure. Given a space of perturbations, we assign to each homology class of the intersection its robustness, the magnitude of a perturbations in this space necessary to kill it, and prove that robustness is stable. Among the applications of this result is a stable notion of robustness for fixed points of continuous mappings and a statement of stability for contours of smooth mappings.
