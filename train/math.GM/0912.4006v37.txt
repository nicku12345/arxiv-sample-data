We prove dual theorems to theorems proved by author in \cite {5}. Beginning with Section 10, we introduce and study so-called "twin numbers of the second kind" and a postulate for them. We give two proofs of the infinity of these numbers and a sufficient condition for truth of the postulate; also we pose several other conjectures. Finally, we consider a conception of axiom of type "AiB".
