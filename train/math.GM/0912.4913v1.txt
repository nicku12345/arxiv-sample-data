In this paper we present experimental ways of evaluating Ramanujan`s quantities which as someone can see are related with algebraic numbers. The good thing with algebraic numbers is that can be found in a closed form, from there approximations, using Mathematica. In this way we produce new formulas and give new ideas for to prove new theorems.
