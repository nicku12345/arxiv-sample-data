We present an elementary proof of the prime number theorem. The relative error follows a golden ratio scaling law and respects the bound obtained from the Riemann's hypothesis. The proof is derived in the framework of a scale free nonarchimedean extension of the real number system exploiting the concept of relative infinitesimals introduced recently in connection with ultrametric models of Cantor sets. The extended real number system is realized as a completion of the field of rational numbers Q under a {\em new} nonarchimedean absolute value, which treats arbitrarily small and large numbers separately from a finite real number.
