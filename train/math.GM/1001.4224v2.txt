Bifurcated supertasks entail the actual infinite division of time (accelerated system of reference) as well as the existence of half-curves of infinite length (supertask system of reference). This paper analyzes both issues from a critique perspective. It also analyzes a conflictive case of hypercomputation performed by means of a bifurcated supertask. The results of these analyzes suggest the convenience of reviewing certain foundational aspects of infinitist theories.
