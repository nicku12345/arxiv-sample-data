We propose a Relational Calculus based on the concept of unary relation. In this Relational Calculus different axiomatic systems converge to a model called Dynamic Generative System with Symmetry (DGSS). In DGSS we define the concepts of relational set and function and prove that extensionality and the substitution property of equality are theorems of DGSS. As a first exemplification of DGSS, we construct a model of natural numbers without relying on Peano's Axioms. Eventually, some new clarifications regarding the nature of the number zero are given.
