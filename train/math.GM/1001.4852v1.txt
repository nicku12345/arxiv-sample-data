On the set of mappings of the given set, we define the product of mappings. If A is associative algebra, then we consider the set of matrices, whose elements are linear mappings of algebra A. In algebra of matrices of linear mappings we define the operation of product. The operation is based on the product of mappings.   If the matrix a of linear mappings has an inverse matrix, then the quasideterminant of the matrix a and the inverse matrix are matrices of linear mappings. In the paper, I consider conditions when a matrix of linear mappings has inverse matrix, as well methods of solving a system of linear equations in an associative algebra.
