Singularities appear in numerous important mathematical models used in Physics. And in most of such cases singularities are involved in essentially nonlinear contexts. For more than four decades, general enough nonlinear theories of singularities have been developed. A critically important related feature is that, above certain levels in singularities, the operation of multiplication, and in general, nonlinear operations on such singularities do inevitably branch in infinitely many ways, without the possibility for the existence of some unique natural or canonical way such nonlinear operations may be performed. Consequently, the choice in such branchings has to come from extraneous considerations.
