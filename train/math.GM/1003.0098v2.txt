It is well known that the distribution of the prime numbers plays a central role in number theory. It has been known, since Riemann's memoir in 1860, that the distribution of prime numbers can be described by the zero-free region of the Riemann zeta function \zeta(s). This function has infinitely many zeros and a unique pole at s = 1. Those zeros at s = -2, -4, -6, ... are known as trivial zeros. The nontrivial zeros of \zeta(s) are all located in the so-called critical strip 0<\Re(s) <1. Define \Lambda(n) =\log p whenever n =p\sp{m} for a prime number p and a positive integer m, and zero otherwise. Let x\ge 2. The \psi-form of the prime number theorem is \psi(x) =\sum\sb{n \le x}\Lambda(n) =x +O\bigl(x\sp{1-H(x)} \log\sp{2} x\big), where the sum runs through the set of positive integers and H(x) is a certain function of x with \tfrac{1}{2} \le H(x) < 1. Tur\'an proved in 1950 that this \psi-form implies that there are no zeros of \zeta(s) for \Re(s) > h(t), where t=\Im(s), and h(t) is a function connected to H(x) in a certain way with 1/2 \le h(t) <1 but both H(x) and h(t) are close to 1. We prove results similar to Tur\'an's where \tfrac{1}{2} \le H(x)< 1 and \tfrac{1}{2} \le h(t) <1 in altered forms without any other restrictions. The proof involves slightly revising and applying Tur\'an's power sum method.
