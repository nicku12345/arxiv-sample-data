Much of Mathematics, and therefore Physics as well, have been limited by four rather consequential restrictions. Two of them are ancient taboos, one is an ancient and no longer felt as such bondage, and the fourth is a surprising omission in Algebra. The paper brings to the attention of those interested these four restrictions, as well as the fact that each of them has by now ways, even if hardly yet known ones, to overcome them.
