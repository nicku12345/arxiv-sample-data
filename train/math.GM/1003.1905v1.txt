This book is organized into seven chapters. Chapter one is introductory in content. The notion of neutrosophic set linear algebras and neutrosophic neutrosophic set linear algebras are introduced and their properties analysed in chapter two. Chapter three introduces the notion of neutrosophic semigroup linear algebras and neutrosophic group linear algebras. A study of their substructures are systematically carried out in this chapter. The fuzzy analogue of neutrosophic group linear algebras, neutrosophic semigroup linear algebras and neutrosophic set linear algebras are introduced in chapter four of this book. Chapter five introduces the concept of neutrosophic group bivector spaces, neutrosophic bigroup linear algebras, neutrosophic semigroup (bisemigroup) linear algebras and neutrosophic biset bivector spaces. The fuzzy analogue of these concepts are given in chapter six. An interesting feature of this book is it contains nearly 424 examples of these new notions. The final chapter suggests over 160 problems which is another interesting feature of this book.
