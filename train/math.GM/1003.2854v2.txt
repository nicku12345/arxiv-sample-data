We have dealt with the Euler's alternating series of the Riemann zeta function to define a regularized ratio appeared in the functional equation even in the critical strip and showed some evidence to indicate the hypothesis. We briefly review the essential points and we also define a finite ratio in the functional equation from divergent quantities in this note.
