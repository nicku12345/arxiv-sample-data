We prove among other things that the omega-limit set of a bounded solution of a Hamilton system \[\left\{\begin{aligned}   & \mathbf{\dot{p}}=\frac{\partial H}{\partial \mathbf{q}}   & \mathbf{\dot{q}}=-\frac{\partial H}{\partial \mathbf{p}} \\ \end{aligned} \right.\] is containing a full-time solution so there are the limits of \frac 1t\int_0^t {\mathbf p}(s)ds and \frac 1t\int_0^t {\mathbf q}(s)ds as t\to\infty for any bounded solution (\mathbf {p,q}) of the Hamilton system. These limits are stationary points of the Hamilton system so if a Hamilton system has no stationary point then every solution of this system is unbounded.
