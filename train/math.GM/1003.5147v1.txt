Artin Presentation Theory, (AP Theory), is a new, direct infusion, via pure braid theory, of discrete group theory, (i.e., symmetry in its purest form), into the theory of {\it smooth} 4-manifolds, (i.e.,(3+1)-Quantum Gravity in its purest topological form), thus exhibiting the most basic, rigorous, universal, model-free intrinsic {\it gauge-gravity} duality in a non-infinitesimal, cone-like graded, as holographic as possible, model-independent, non-perturbative, background-independent, parameter-free manner. {\it In AP Theory even smooth topology change becomes gauge-theoretic, setting the stage for a rigorous smooth topological (3+1)-QFT of Dynamic Dark Energy.} In this theory, the rigid \infty of the dimension of classical Hilbert space is substituted by the dynamic \infty of the \infty generation at each stage of a cone-like graded subgroup of topology-changing transitions/interactions. As a corollary, the Cosmological Constant problem and the YM Millenium Mass Gap problem, two of the most perplexing main problems of modern physics, become rigorously, intimately mathematically related, by having the same qualitative {\it dynamical} roots. Ultimately our main point is meta-mathematical, as far as modern physics is concerned: due to the discrete group-theoretic conceptual simplicity of the theory, with its group-theoretic 'Planckian membrane/discreteness' starting point, {\it the fact that it is not just a mere mathematical model,} and all its properties above, any other {\it mathematically rigorous} approach has to built on AP Theory and be topologically absorbed and enveloped by it.
