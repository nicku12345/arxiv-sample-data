We introduce Hausdorff-Colombeau measure in respect with negative fractal dimensions. Axiomatic quantum field theory in spacetime with negative fractal dimensions is proposed.Spacetime is modelled as a multifractal subset of R^{4} with positive and negative fractal dimensions.The cosmological constant problem arises because the magnitude of vacuum energy density predicted by quantum field theory is about 120 orders of magnitude larger than the value implied by cosmological observations of accelerating cosmic expansion. We pointed out that the fractal nature of the quantum space-time with negative Hausdorff-Colombeau dimensions can resolve this tension. The canonical Quantum Field Theory is widely believed to break down at some fundamental high-energy cutoff E and therefore the quantum fluctuations in the vacuum can be treated classically seriously only up to this high-energy cutoff. In this paper we argue that Quantum Field Theory in fractal space-time with negative Hausdorff-Colombeau dimensions gives high-energy cutoff on natural way. In order to obtain disered physical result we apply the canonical Pauli-Villars regularization up to E. It means that there exist the ghost-driven acceleration of the univers hidden in cosmological constant.
