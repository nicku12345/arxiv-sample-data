A manifold M^n inherits a labeled n-dimensional graph \widetilde{M}[G^L] structure consisting of its charts. This structure enables one to characterize fundamental groups of manifolds, classify those of locally compact manifolds with finite non-homotopic loops by that of labeled graphs G^L. As a by-product, this approach also concludes that {\it every homotopy n-sphere is homeomorphic to the sphere S^n for an integer n\geq 1}, particularly, the Perelman's result for n=3.
