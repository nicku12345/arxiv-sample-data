In this paper we present unsolved problems that involve infinite tunnels of recursive triangles or recursive polygons, either in a decreasing or in an increasing way. The "nedians or order i in a triangle" are generalized to "nedians of ratio r" and "nedians of angle {\alpha}" or "nedians at angle {\beta}", and afterwards one considers their corresponding "nedian triangles" and "nedian polygons". This tunneling idea came from physics. Further research would be to construct similar tunnel of 3-D solids (and generally tunnels of n-D solids).
