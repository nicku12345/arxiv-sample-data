A question is identified with a topology on a given set of irreducible assertions. It is shown that there are three types of a question. Type-I question generates sub-question, type-II question has a definite answer and type-III question is irrelevant. We suggest that the most intelligent machine asks type-II questions. We also claim that a truly intelligent machine cannot be desireless. This work may prove useful in machine learning and may open up new ways to understand mind.
