In this paper we give an example of uniform convergence of the sequence of column vectors \displaystyle{A_1\dots A_nV\over\left\Vert A_1\dots A_nV\right\Vert}, A_i\in\{A,B,C\}, A,B,C being some (0,1)-matrices of order 7 with much null entries, and V a fixed positive column vector. These matrices come from the study of the Bernoulli convolution in the base \beta>1 such that \beta^3=2\beta^2-\beta+1, that is, the (continuous singular) probability distribution of the random variable \displaystyle(\beta-1)\sum_{n=1}^\infty{\omega_n\over\beta^n} when the independent random variables \omega_n take the values 0 and 1 with probability \displaystyle{1\over2}. In the last section we deduce, from the uniform convergence of \displaystyle{A_1\dots A_nV\over\left\Vert A_1\dots A_nV\right\Vert}, the Gibbs and the multifractal properties of this measure.
