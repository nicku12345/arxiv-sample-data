As we known, the {\it Seifert-Van Kampen theorem} handles fundamental groups of those topological spaces X=U\cup V for open subsets U, V\subset X such that U\cap V is arcwise connected. In this paper, this theorem is generalized to such a case of maybe not arcwise-connected, i.e., there are C_1, C_2,..., C_m arcwise-connected components in U\cap V for an integer m\geq 1, which enables one to find fundamental groups of combinatorial spaces by that of spaces with theirs underlying topological graphs, particularly, that of compact manifolds by their underlying graphs of charts.
