This book introduces the concept of neutrosophic bilinear algebras and their generalizations to n-linear algebras, n>2. This book has five chapters. The first chapter is introductory in nature and gives a few essential definitions and references for the reader to make use of the literature in case the reader is not thorough with the basics. The second chapter deals with different types of neutrosophic bilinear algebras and bivector spaces and proves several results analogous to linear bialgebra. In chapter three the authors introduce the notion of n-linear algebras and prove several theorems related to them. Many of the classical theorems for neutrosophic algebras are proved with appropriate modifications. Chapter four indicates the probable applications of these algebraic structures. The final chapter suggests about 80 innovative problems for the reader to solve.
