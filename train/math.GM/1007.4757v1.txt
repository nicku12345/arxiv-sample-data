Skew-symmetric forms possess unique capabilities. The properties of closed exterior and dual forms, namely, invariance, covariance, conjugacy and duality, either explicitly or implicitly appear in all invariant mathematical formalisms. This enables one to see an internal connection between various branches of mathematics. However, the theory of closed exterior forms cannot be completed without an answer to a question of how the closed exterior forms emerge. In the present paper we discus essentially new skew-symmetric forms, which generate closed exterior forms. Such skew-symmetric forms, which are evolutionary ones, are derived from differential equations, and, in contrast to exterior forms, they are defined on nonintegrable manifolds.
