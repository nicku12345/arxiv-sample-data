In this article we present evaluations of continued fractions studied by Ramanujan. More precisely we give the complete polynomial equations of Rogers-Ramanujan and other continued fractions, using tools from the elementary theory of the Elliptic functions. We see that all these fractions are roots of polynomials with coeficients depending only on the inverse elliptic nome-q and in some cases the Elliptic Integral-K. In most of simplifications of formulas we use Mathematica.
