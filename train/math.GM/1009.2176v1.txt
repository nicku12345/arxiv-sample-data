The notion of Intuitionistic fuzzy hypervector space has been generalized and a few basic properties on this concept are studied. It has been shown that the intersection and union of an arbitrary family of Intuitionistic fuzzy hypervector spaces are also Intuitionistic fuzzy hypervector space. Lastly, the notion of a linear transformation on a hypervector space is introduced and established an important theorem relative to Intuitionistic fuzzy hypervector spaces.
