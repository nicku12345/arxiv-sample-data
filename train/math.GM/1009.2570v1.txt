We solve some forms of non homogeneous differential equations in one and two dimensions. By expanding the solution into whell-posed closed form-Eisenstein series the solution itself is quite simple and elementary. Also we consider Fourier series solutions of linear differential operator equations. In the third section we study operators which are functions of the Leibnitz derivative. The last result is the complete solution of a non homogenus 2-degree ODE with linear coeficients. The non homogenous part is an arbirtary function of L_2(\bf R\rm)
