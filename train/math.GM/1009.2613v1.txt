The paper revisits concretely the algebraic K-theory in the light of the global program of Langlands by taking into account the new algebraic interpretation of homotopy viewed as deformation(s) of Galois representations given by compactified algebraic groups. More concretely, we introduce higher algebraic bilinear K-theories referring to homotopy and cohomotopy and related to the reducible bilinear global program of Langlands as well as mixed higher bilinear KK-theories related to dynamical geometric bilinear global program of Langlands.
