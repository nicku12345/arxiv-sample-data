Let \mathcal{P} be the set of all primes and \psi(n)=n\prod_{n\in \mathcal{P},p|n}(1+1/p) be the Dedekind psi function. We show that the Riemann hypothesis is satisfied if and only if f(n)=\psi(n)/n-e^{\gamma} \log \log n <0 for all integers n>n_0=30 (D), where \gamma \approx 0.577 is Euler's constant. This inequality is equivalent to Robin's inequality that is recovered from (D) by replacing \psi(n) with the sum of divisor function \sigma(n)\ge \psi(n) and the lower bound by n_0=5040. For a square free number, both arithmetical functions \sigma and \psi are the same. We also prove that any exception to (D) may only occur at a positive integer n satisfying \psi(m)/m<\psi(n)/n, for any m
