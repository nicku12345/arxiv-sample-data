Let x\ge 2. The \psi-form of the prime number theorem is \psi(x) =\sum\sb{n \le x}\Lambda(n) =x +O\bigl(x\sp{1-H(x)} \log\sp{2} x\big), where H(x) is a certain function of x with 0< H(x) \le \tfrac{1}{2}. Tur\'an proved in 1950 that this \psi-form implies that there are no zeros of \zeta(s) for \Re(s) > h(t), where t=\Im(s), and h(t) is a function related to H(x) with 0< h(t) \le \tfrac{1}{2}, but both H(x) and h(t) are very close to 1. We prove results similar to Tur\'an's, with H(x) and  h(t) in some altered forms without the restriction that H(x) and h(t) are close to 1. The proof involves slightly revising and applying Tur\'an's power sum method and using the Lindel\"of hypothesis in the zero growth rate form, which is proved recently.
