In this paper, we give a proof for four color theorem(four color conjecture). Our proof does not involve computer assistance and the most important is that it can be generalized to prove Hadwiger Conjecture. Moreover, we give algorithms to color and test planarity of planar graphs, which can be generalized to graphs containing K_x(x>5) minor.   There are four parts of this paper:   Part-1: To Prove Four Color Theorem   Part-2: An Equivalent Statement of Hadwiger Conjecture when k=5   Part-3: A New Proof of Wagner's Equivalence Theorem   Part-4: A Geometric View of Outerplanar Graph
