We show that the Heisenberg type group H_X=(\Bbb{Z}_2 \oplus V) \leftthreetimes V^{\ast}, with the discrete Boolean group V:=C(X,\Z_2), canonically defined by any Stone space X, is always minimal. That is, H_X does not admit any strictly coarser Hausdorff group topology. This leads us to the following result: for every (locally compact) non-archimedean G there exists a (resp., locally compact) non-archimedean minimal group M such that G is a group retract of M. For discrete groups G the latter was proved by S. Dierolf and U. Schwanengel. We unify some old and new characterization results for non-archimedean groups. Among others we show that every continuous group action of G on a Stone space X is a restriction of a continuous group action by automorphisms of G on a topological (even, compact) group K. We show also that any epimorphism f: H \to G (in the category of Hausdorff topological groups) into a non-archimedean group G must be dense.
