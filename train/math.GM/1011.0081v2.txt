In the framework of the PDE's algebraic topology, previously introduced by A. Pr\'astaro, {\em exotic n-d'Alembert PDE's} are considered. These are n-d'Alembert PDE's, (d'A)_n, admitting Cauchy manifolds N\subset (d'A)_n identifiable with exotic spheres, or such that \partial N, can be exotic spheres. For such equations local and global existence theorems and stability theorems are obtained.
