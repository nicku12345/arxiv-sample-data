In this paper, first we have established two sets of sufficient conditions for a mapping to have unique fixed point in a intuitionistic fuzzy metric space and then we have redefined the contraction mapping in a intuitionistic fuzzy metric space and thereafter we proved the Banach Fixed Point theorem.
