In the framework of the PDE's algebraic topology, previously introduced by A. Pr\'astaro, are considered {\em exotic differential equations}, i.e., differential equations admitting Cauchy manifolds N identifiable with exotic spheres, or such that their boundaries \partial N are exotic spheres. For such equations are obtained local and global existence theorems and stability theorems. In particular the smooth (4-dimensional) Poincar\'e conjecture is proved. This allows to complete the previous Theorem 4.59 in \cite{PRA17} also for the case n=4.
