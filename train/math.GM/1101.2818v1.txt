In this paper the concept of Q-fuzzification of ideals of gamma-semigroups has been introduced and some important properties have been investigated. A characterization of regular gamma-semigroup in terms of Q-fuzzy ideals has been obtained. Operator semigroups of a gamma-semigroup has been made to work by obtaining various relationships between Q-fuzzy ideals of a gamma-semigroup and that of its operator semigroups.
