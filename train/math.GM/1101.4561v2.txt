In this paper, we study the topology associated to the fractal manifold model. It turns out that this topology is actually a family of topologies that gives to the fractal manifold a structure of variable topological space. Additionally, we prove that using the fractal manifold as model for the universe dynamic, the universe expansion is intimately correlated to the variation of the topology.
