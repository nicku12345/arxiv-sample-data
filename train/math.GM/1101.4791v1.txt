The purpose of this paper is to introduce different types of operations on fuzzy ideals of \Gamma-semirings and to prove subsequently that these oprations give rise to different structures such as complete lattice, modular lattice on some restricted class of fuzzy ideals of \Gamma-semirings. A characterization of a regular \Gamma-semiring has also been obtained in terms of fuzzy subsets.
