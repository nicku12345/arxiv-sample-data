The operator semirings of a \Gamma-semiring have been brought into use to study \Gamma-semiring in terms of fuzzy subsets. This is accomplished by obtaining various relationships between the set of all fuzzy ideals of a \Gamma-semiring and the set of all fuzzy ideals of its left operator semiring such as lattice isomorphism between the sets of fuzzy ideals of a \Gamma-semiring and its operator semirings.
