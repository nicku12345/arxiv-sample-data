In this book we introduce the notion of interval semigroups using intervals of the form [0, a], a is real. Several types of interval semigroups like fuzzy interval semigroups, interval symmetric semigroups, special symmetric interval semigroups, interval matrix semigroups and interval polynomial semigroups are defined and discussed. This book has eight chapters. The main feature of this book is that we suggest 241 problems in the eighth chapter. In this book the authors have defined 29 new concepts and illustrates them with 231 examples. Certainly this will find several applications.
