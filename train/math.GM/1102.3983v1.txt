We consider the problem of determining the Fourier integral in the Hilbert space of square integrable functions. Fourier integral is the scalar product of two functions belonging to the Hilbert space of square integrable functions and the Hilbert space of almost periodic functions. Scalar product for different Hilbert spaces defined at the intersection of these spaces, which contains only one zero element. Therefore, the Fourier integral is not defined in the Hilbert space of square integrable functions with nonzero norm.
