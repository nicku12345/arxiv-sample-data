We propose a new approach at Fermat's Last Theorem (FLT) solution: for each FLT equation we associate a polynomial of the same degree. The study of the roots of the polynomial allows us to investigate the FLT validity. This technique, certainly within the reach of Fermat himself, allows us infer that this is the marvelous proof that Fermat claimed to have.
