We study the series \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{(-1)^n}{n!}t^nf^{(n)}(t). We show that for analytic functions this series is uniformly and absolutely convergent to the constant f(0). We show that there are nowhere analytic functions for them the series is divergent for all t and also there are nowhere analytic functions for them the series is convergent to f(0) at least for t in a dense subset of \R.
