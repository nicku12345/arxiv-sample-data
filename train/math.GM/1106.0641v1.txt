This book has seven chapters. In chapter one we give the basics needed to make this book a self contained one. Chapter two introduces the notion of interval semigroups and interval semifields and are algebraically analysed. Chapter three introduces special types of interval semirings like matrix interval semirings and interval polynomial semirings. Chapter four for the first time introduces the notion of group interval semirings, semigroup interval semirings, loop interval semirings and groupoid interval semirings and these structures are studied. Interval neutrosophic semirings are introduced in chapter five. Applications of these structures are given in chapter six. The final chapter suggests around 120 problems for the reader.
