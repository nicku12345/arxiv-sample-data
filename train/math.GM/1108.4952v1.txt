Sequences diverge either because they head off to infinity or because they oscillate. Part 1 \cite{Part1} of this paper laid the pure mathematics groundwork by defining Archimedean classes of infinite numbers as limits of smooth sequences. Part 2 follows that with applied mathematics, showing that general sequences can usually be converted into smooth sequences, and thus have a well-defined limit.   Each general sequence is split into the sum of smooth, periodic (including Lebesgue integrable), chaotic and random components. The mean of each of these components divided by a smooth sequence, or the mean of the mean, will usually be a smooth sequence, and so the oscillatory sequence will have at least a leading term limit. Examples of limits of oscillatory sequences with well-defined limits are given.   Methodologies are included for a way to calculate limits on the reals and on complex numbers, a way to evaluate improper integrals by limit of a Riemann sum, and a way to square the Dirac delta function.
