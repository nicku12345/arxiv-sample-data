Sequences diverge either because they head off to infinity or because they oscillate. Part 1 constructs a non-Archimedean framework of infinite numbers that is large enough to contain asymptotic limit points for non-oscillating sequences that head off to infinity. It begins by defining Archimedean classes of infinite numbers. Each class is denoted by a prototype sequence. These prototypes are used as asymptotes for determining leading term limits of sequences. By subtracting off leading term limits and repeating, limits are obtained for a subset of sequences called here ``smooth sequences". \mathbb{I}_n is defined as the set of ratios of limits of smooth sequences. It is shown that \mathbb{I}_n is an ordered field that includes real, infinite and infinitesimal numbers.
