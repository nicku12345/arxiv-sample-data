Part One: The main work in this paper is on properties of the logarithmic integral Li(x) and the prime counting function \pi(x). Let define the truncation of the logarithmic integral Li(x) as \[\pi^{*}(x,N):=\frac{x}{\log x}\sum_{n=0}^{N}\frac{n!}{\log^{n}x}.\] Firstly, we prove Li(x)-\pi^{*}(x,M)<x^{1/64} for x\geq24. Secondly, we prove \[ \pi(x)-\pi^{*}(x,N)<\sqrt{x}\texttt{ for }x\geq599.\] Finally, we prove |Li(x)-\pi(x)|\leq c\sqrt{x}\log x where c is a positive constant greater than 1. Hence we prove the Riemann Hypothesis based on the theorem as shown by H. Koch in 1901.   Part Two: Different from former researches on the distribution of primes in short intervals, we prove a theorem: Let \Phi(x)=\beta x^{1/2}, \beta>0, and x\geq x_{\beta} which satisfies (\log x_{\beta})^{2}/x_{\beta}^{0.0327283}\leq\beta. Then there are \[ \frac{\pi(x+\Phi(x))-\pi(x)}{\Phi(x)/\log x}=1+O(\frac{1}{\log x}) \] and \[ \lim_{x \to \infty}\frac{\pi(x+\Phi(x))-\pi(x)}{\Phi(x)/\log x}=1. \]
