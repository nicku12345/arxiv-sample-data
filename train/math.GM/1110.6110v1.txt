The subject matter of this work is quadratic and cubic polynomial functions with integer coefficients;and all of whose roots are integers. The material of this work is directed primarily at educators,students,and teachers of mathematics,grades K12 to K20.The results of this work are expressed in Theorems3,4,and5. Of these theorems, Theorem3, is the one that most likely, the general reader of this article will have some familiarity with.In Theorem3, precise coefficient conditions are given;in order that a quadratic trinomial(with integer) have two integer roots or zeros.On the other hand, Theorems4 and5 are largely unfamiliar territory. In Theorem4, precise coefficient conditions are stated; for a monic cubic polynomial to have a double(i.e.of multiplicity 2) integer root, and a single integer root(i.e.of multiplicity 1).The entire family of such cubics can be described in terms of four groups or subfamilies; each such group being a two-integer parameter subfamily. In Theorem5, a one-integer parameter family of quadratic trinomials(with integer coefficients) with two integer roots; is described.The parameter can take any odd positive integer values.
