In this book for the first time the authors introduce the notion of real neutrosophic complex numbers. Further the new notion of finite complex modulo integers is defined. For every C(Z_n) the complex modulo integer i_F is such that 2F_i = n - 1. Several algebraic structures on C(Z_n) are introduced and studied. Further the notion of complex neutrosophic modulo integers is introduced. Vector spaces and linear algebras are constructed using these neutrosophic complex modulo integers.
