In this article we solve a general class of sextic equations. The solution follows if we consider the j-invariant and relate it with the polynomial equation's coefficients. The form of the solution is a relation of Rogers-Ramanujan continued fraction. The inverse technique can also be used for the evaluation of the Rogers-Ramanujan continued fraction, in which the equation is not now the depressed equation but another quite more simplified equation.
