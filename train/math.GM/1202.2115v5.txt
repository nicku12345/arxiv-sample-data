An equivalent formulation of the Riemann hypothesis is given. The physical interpretation of the Riemann hypothesis equivalent formulation is given in the framework of quantum theory terminology. One more power series related to the Riemann Xi function and the Riemann hypothesis is considered. Some roots of the polynomial connected with the power series are studied. It is shown that the Riemann hypothesis is true. But it is undecidable and must be considered as an axiom.
