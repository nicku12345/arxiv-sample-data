An ideal I is a family of subsets of positive integers \textbf{N} which is closed under taking finite unions and subsets of its elements. A sequence (x_n) of real numbers is said to be I-convergent to a real number L, if for each \; \varepsilon> 0 the set \{n:|x_{n}-L|\geq \varepsilon\} belongs to I. We introduce I-ward compactness of a subset of \textbf{R}, the set of real numbers, and I-ward continuity of a real function in the senses that a subset E of \textbf{R} is I-ward compact if any sequence (x_{n}) of points in E has an I-quasi-Cauchy subsequence, and a real function is I-ward continuous if it preserves I-quasi-Cauchy sequences where a sequence (x_{n}) is called to be I-quasi-Cauchy when (\Delta x_{n}) is I-convergent to 0. We obtain results related to I-ward continuity, I-ward compactness, ward continuity, ward compactness, ordinary compactness, ordinary continuity, \delta-ward continuity, and slowly oscillating continuity.
