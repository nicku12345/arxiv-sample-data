We consider the set of power functions defined on the set of positive real number, and their linear combinations. After recalling some properties of the gamma function, we give two general definitions of derivatives of positive and negative integers, positive and negative fractional orders.Properties of linearity and commutativity are studied and the notions of semi-equality,semi-linearity and semi-commutativity are introduced. Our approach gives a unified definition of the common derivatives and integrals and their generalization.
