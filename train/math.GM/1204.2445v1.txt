In this paper we generalize the concept of a quasi-Cauchy sequence to a concept of a p-quasi-Cauchy sequence for any fixed positive integer p. For p=1 we obtain some earlier existing results as a special case. We obtain some interesting theorems related to p-quasi-Cauchy continuity, G-sequential continuity, slowly oscillating continuity, and uniform continuity. It turns out that a function f defined on an interval is uniformly continuous if and only if there exists a positive integer p such that f preserves p-quasi-Cauchy sequences where a sequence (x_{n}) is called p-quasi-Cauchy if (x_{n+p}-x_{n})_{n=1}^{\infty} is a null sequence.
