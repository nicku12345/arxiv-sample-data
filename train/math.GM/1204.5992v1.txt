This work introduces a new functional series for expanding an analytic function in terms of an arbitrary analytic function. It is generally applicable and straightforward to use. It is also suitable for approximating the behavior of a function with a few terms. A new expression is presented for the composite function's n'th derivative. The inverse-composite method is handled in this work also.
