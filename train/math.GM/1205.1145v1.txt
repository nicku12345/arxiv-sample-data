We present a geometric way to generate Blundon type inequalities. Theorem 3.1 gives the formula for cosPOQ in terms of the barycentric coordinates of the points P and Q with respect to a given triangle. This formula implies Blundon type inequalities generated by the points P and Q (Theorem 3.2). Some applications are given in the last section by choosing special points P and Q.
