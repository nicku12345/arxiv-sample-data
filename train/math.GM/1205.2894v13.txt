This is a work in three parts, devoted to encode strong reactions of the high energy physics, in the algebraic topologic theory of quantum super PDE's, (previously formulated by A. Pr\'astaro). In particular strong reactions are characterized by means of boundary value problems in quantum super PDE's. In such a way one obtains representations of quantum nonlinear propagators in quantum super PDE's, by means of elementary ones (quantum handle decompositions of quantum nonlinear propagators). These are useful to encode nuclear and subnuclear reactions in quantum physics. Pr\'astaro's geometric theory of quantum PDE's allows us to obtain constructive and dynamically justified answers to some important open problems in high energy physics.
