A real function f is ward continuous if f preserves quasi-Cauchyness, i.e. (f(x_{n})) is a quasi-Cauchy sequence whenever (x_{n}) is quasi-Cauchy; and a subset E of \textbf{R} is quasi-Cauchy compact if any sequence \textbf{x}=(x_{n}) of points in E has a quasi-Cauchy subsequence where \textbf{R} is the set of real numbers. These known results suggest to us introducing a concept of upward (respectively, downward) half quasi-Cauchy continuity in the sense that a function f is upward (respectively, downward) half quasi-Cauchy continuous if it preserves upward (respectively, downward) half quasi-Cauchy sequences, and a concept of upward (respectively, downward) half quasi-Cauchy compactness in the sense that a subset E of \textbf{R} is upward (respectively, downward) half quasi-Cauchy compact if any sequence of points in E has an upward (respectively, downward) half quasi-Cauchy subsequence. We investigate upward(respectively, downward) half quasi-Cauchy continuity and upward (respectively, downward) half quasi-Cauchy compactness, and prove related theorems.
