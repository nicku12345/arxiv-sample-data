In this document, prime numbers are related as functions over time, mimicking the Sieve of Eratosthenes. For this purpose, the mathematical representation is a uni-dimentional time line depicting the number line for positive natural numbers N, where each number n represents a time t. In the same way as the Eratosthenes' sieve, which iteratively mark as composite the multiples of each prime, starting at each prime. This dynamical prime number function P(s) zero-cross all composite numbers departing from primes, following a linear progression over time.
