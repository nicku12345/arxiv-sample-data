The main results of this paper are the formal constructions, both rigorous and intuitive of the "Aleph" intrinsic extension of the set of non negative integers N and the "Omega" smallest strict over-field of R which is totally ordered and complete. The first differential and integral elements of a new Non Standard Analysis (NSA*) are given. This very simple NSA* is compared to A.Robinson's and J.H.Conway's.
