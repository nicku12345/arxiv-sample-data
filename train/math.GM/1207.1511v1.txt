In this report, the explicit probability density functions of the random Euclidean distances associated with equilateral triangles are given, when the two endpoints of a link are randomly distributed in 1) the same triangle, 2) two adjacent triangles sharing a side, 3) two parallel triangles sharing a vertex, and 4) two diagonal triangles sharing a vertex, respectively. The density function for 1) is based on the most recent work by Basel [1]. 2)-4) are based on 1) and our previous work in [2], [3]. Simulation results show the accuracy of the obtained closed-form distance distribution functions, which are important in the theory of geometrical probability. The first two statistical moments of the random distances and the polynomial fits of the density functions are also given in this report for practical uses.
