Mathematicians has been trying to prove the weak Goldbach's conjecture by adding prime numbers, as stated in the conjecture. However, we believe that the solution does not need to be analytically solved. Instead of trying to add prime numbers to prove the conjecture, we developed a prime number function P_{odd}(x)p>2, including odd primes p > 2, isomorphic and equivalent to a function N_{odd}(x)n>1, including odd natural numbers greater than one, n_{odd} > 1, in which, the sum of three of its elements result in odd numbers greater than 7, proving the conjecture.
