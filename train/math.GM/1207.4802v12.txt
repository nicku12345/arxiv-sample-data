The binary Goldbach conjecture asserts that every even integer greater than 4 is the sum of two primes. In this paper, we prove that there exists an integer K_\alpha such that every even integer x > p_k^2 can be expressed as the sum of two primes, where p_k is the kth prime number and k > K_\alpha. To prove this statement, we begin by introducing a type of double sieve of Eratosthenes as follows. Given a positive even integer x > 4, we sift from [1, x] all those elements that are congruents to 0 modulo p or congruents to x modulo p, where p is a prime less than \sqrt{x}. Therefore, any integer in the interval [\sqrt{x}, x] that remains unsifted is a prime q for which either x-q = 1 or x-q is also a prime. Then, we introduce a new way of formulating a sieve, which we call the sequence of k-tuples of remainders. By means of this tool, we prove that there exists an integer K_\alpha > 5 such that p_k / 2 is a lower bound for the sifting function of this sieve, for every even number x that satisfies p_k^2 < x < p_{k+1}^2, where k > K_\alpha, which implies that x > p_k^2 \; (k > K_\alpha) can be expressed as the sum of two primes.
