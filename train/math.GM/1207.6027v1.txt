In this research paper, structured bi-matrix variate, matrix quadratic equations are considered. Some lemmas related to determining the eigenvalues of unknown matrices are proved. Also, a method of determining the diagonalizabe unknown matrices is provided. The results are generalized to multi-matrix variate, matrix polynomial equations. Briefly generalization to tensor variate polynomial equations is discussed. It is hoped that the results lead to important contributions in "non-commutative algebra".
