This paper presents some considerations about the Goldbach's conjecture (GC). The work is based on elementary results of the number theory and it provides a constructive method that permits, given an even integer, to find at least a pair of prime numbers according to the GC. Eventually a correlation will be provided between this constructive method and a class of problems of operations research.
