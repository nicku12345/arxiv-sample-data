The set of prime numbers has been analyzed, based on their algebraic and arithmetical structure. Here by obtaining a sort of linear formula for the set of prime numbers, they are redefined and identified; under a systematic procedure it has been shown that the set of prime numbers is combinations (unions and intersections) of some subsets of natural numbers, with more primary structures. In fact generally, the logical essence of obtained formula for prime numbers is similar to formula 2n - 1 for odd numbers, and so on. Subsequently, using obtained formula we can define all composite numbers. Finally specified examples for obtained formula are presented.
