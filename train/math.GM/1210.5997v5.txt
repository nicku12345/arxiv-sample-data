In this article we study in depth the Dirichlet theorem, which states that if a, b are relative prime integers, the sequence p = an + b contains infinite prime numbers, we simplify and generalize this theorem, we enunciate some special theorems (from Elias), we see equivalence with Bertrand's postulate and we deduce the validity of the Goldbach conjecture. Finally we enunciate some additional results that are deduced from the conjecture-theorem of Goldbach-
