The presented material continues the previous article (arxiv:1007.1059) and also is devoted to the equivalent conversion between the graphs. The examining of the transformation of the vertex graphs into the edge graphs (together with the opposite transformation) illustrates the reasons of the appearance of NP-completeness from the point of view of the graph theory. We suggest that it also illustrates the synchronous possibility and impossibility of the struggle with NP-completeness.
