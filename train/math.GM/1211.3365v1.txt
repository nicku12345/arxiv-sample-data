In this paper, we introduce the notion of expanding topological space. We define the topological expansion of a topological space via local multi-homeomorphism over coproduct topology, and we prove that the coproduct family associated to any fractal family of topological spaces is expanding. In particular, we prove that the more a topological space expands, the finer the topology of its indexed states is. Using multi-homeomorphisms over associated coproduct topological spaces, we define a locally expandable topological space and we prove that a locally expandable topological space has a topological expansion. Specifically, we prove that the expanding fractal manifold is locally expandable and has a natural topological expansion.
