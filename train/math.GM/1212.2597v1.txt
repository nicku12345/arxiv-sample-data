In this paper, we presents a characterization of compact subsets of the fuzzy number space equipped with the level convergence topology. Based on this, it is shown that compactness is equivalent to sequential compactness on the fuzzy number space equipped with the level convergence topology. Diamond and Kloeden gave a characterization of compact sets in fuzzy number spaces equipped with the supremum metric, Fang and Xue also gave a characterization of compact sets in one-dimensional fuzzy number spaces equipped with supremum metric. The latter characterization is just the one-dimensional case of the former characterization. There exists conflict between the characterization given by us and the characterizations given by the above mentioned authors. We point out the characterizations gave by them is incorrect by a counterexample.
