A general technique for proving the irrationality of the zeta constants \zeta(s) for odd s = 2n + 1 \geq 3 from the known irrationality of the beta constants L(2n+1) is developed in this note. The results on the irrationality of the zeta constants \zeta(2n), where n\geq 1, and \zeta(3) are well known, but the results on the irrationality for the zeta constants \zeta(2n+1), where n \geq 2, are new, and these results seem to confirm that these constants are irrational numbers.
