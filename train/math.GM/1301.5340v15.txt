In this article we proved so-called strong reflection principles corresponding to formal theories Th which has omega-models. An posible generalization of the Lob's theorem is considered.Main results is: (1) let k be an inaccessible cardinal, then \neg Con(ZFC+\exists k),(2) there is a Lindel\"of T_3 indestructible space of pseudocharacter \leqslant \aleph_1 and size \aleph_2 in L.
