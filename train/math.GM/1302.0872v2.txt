In this paper analyzes \textit{The Erd\H{o}s-Straus conjecture} asserts that f(n) > 0 for every n \geq 2, where f(n) indicates the number of solutions to the Diophantine Equation \frac{4}{n}=\frac{1}{n_1}+\frac{1}{n_2}+\frac{1}{n_3}. We show that there exists a function G(p) to be a boundary asymptotic of \sum_{p\leq{N}}f_{I}(p), which will have an associated error. We analyze the case when n is a prime number, this was separately developed by Terence Tao [8] and Jia [1], [2].
