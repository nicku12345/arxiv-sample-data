In this article, we discuss sixth-order and seventh-order iterative methods for nonlinear equations. Derivative-based and derivative-free, both categories are presented for said iterative methods. Especially sixth-order derivative-based and derivative-free iterative families are constructed in such a way that they circumstance a wide class of sixth-order methods which are developed in last many years. Weight functions are introduced to enhance the efficiency and parametric combination gives weight-age flexibility in between weight functions.
