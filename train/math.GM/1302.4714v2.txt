The results of difference sequences theory are applied to analytic function theory and Diophantine equations. As a result we have the equation which connects the n-th derivative of a function with the difference sequence for the values of this function. Also the results of difference sequences theory helps to discover some features of the whole kind of Diophantine equations. The method presented allows to find limits where Diophantine equation does not have integer solutions. The higher power of Diophantine equation the better this method works.
