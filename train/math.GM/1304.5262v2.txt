Since the mathematicians of ancient Greece until Fermat, since Gauss until today; the way how the primes along the numerical straight line are distributed has become perhaps the most difficult math problem; many people believe that their distribution is chaotic, governed only by the laws of chance. In this article the author tries to resolve satisfactorily all matter related to the distance between primes, based on the determination of a lower bound for the primes counting function, the estimate of Legendre's conjecture, and the iterative method for solving equations.
