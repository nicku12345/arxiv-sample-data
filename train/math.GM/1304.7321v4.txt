Mersenne numbers and Fermat numbers are two hot and difficult issues in number theory. This paper constructs a special group for every positive odd number other than 1, and discovers an algorithm for determining the multiplicative order of 2 modulo q for each positive odd number q. It is worth mentioning that this paper discovers two symmetric properties of Mersenne numbers and Fermat numbers.
