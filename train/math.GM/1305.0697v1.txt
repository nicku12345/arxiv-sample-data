The main object of this paper is to investigate \lambda-statistically quasi-Cauchy sequences. A real valued function f defined on a subset E of \textbf{R}, the set of real numbers, is called \lambda-statistically ward continuous on E if it preserves \lambda-statistically quasi-Cauchy sequences of points in E. It turns out that uniform continuity coincides with \lambda-statistically ward continuity on \lambda-statistically ward compact subsets.
