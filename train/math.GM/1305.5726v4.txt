Extending a classical integral representation of Dirichlet L-functions associated to a non trivial primitive character we define associated functions B(y,z) which are eigenfunction of a Hermitian operator H. The eigenvalues are the imaginary parts of the L-functions zeros. We prove that if s is a non trivial zero of such a Dirichlet L-function with Re(s)<1/2, then: - the associated eigenfunction B(z,y) is square integrable. - the operator H is "Hermitian" for this function: <BH,B>=<B,HB>. We deduce from this (using the idea of Hilbert-Polya and finding a contradiction) the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis: the non trivial zeros of a Dirichlet L-function lie on the critical line Re(s)=1/2. This results correspond to a weak form of the Hilbert-Polya conjecture (as for Re(s)=1/2 the eigenfunctions presented here are not square integrable).
