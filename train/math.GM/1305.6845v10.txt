The Riemann hypothesis is proved by quantum-extending the zeta Riemann function to a quantum mapping between quantum 1-spheres with quantum algebra A=\mathbb{C}, in the sense of A. Pr\'astaro \cite{PRAS01, PRAS02}. Algebraic topologic properties of quantum-complex manifolds and suitable bordism groups of morphisms in the category \mathfrak{Q}_{\mathbb{C}} of quantum-complex manifolds are utilized.
