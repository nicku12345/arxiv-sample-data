The concept of fractional order derivative can be found in extensive range of many different subject areas. For this reason, the concept of fractional order derivative should be examined. After giving different methods mostly used in engineering and scientific applications, the omissions or errors of these methods will be discussed in this study. The mostly used methods are Euler, Riemann-Liouville and Caputo which are fractional order derivatives. The applications of these methods to constant and identity functions will be given in this study. Obtained results demonstrated that all of three methods have errors and deficiencies. In fact, the obtained results demonstrated that the methods given as fractional order derivatives are curve fitting methods or curve approximation methods. In this paper, we redefined fractional order derivative (FOD) by using classical derivative definition and L Hospital method, since classical derivative definition concluded in indefinite limit such as 0/0. The obtained definition is same as classical derivative definition in case of fractional order is equal to 1. This implies that definitions and theorems in this paper sound and complete.   After defining the FOD concept, the applications of FOD for polynomial, exponential, trigonometric and logarithmic functions were handled in this study. The properties of FOD for positive monotonic increasing/decreasing functions were demonstrated in this paper. Another important point is that the relation between derivatives and complex functions were also verified in this paper.
