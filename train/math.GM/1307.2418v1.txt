A real valued function f defined on a subset E of \textbf{R}, the set of real numbers, is statistically upward continuous if it preserves statistically upward half quasi-Cauchy sequences, is statistically downward continuous if it preserves statistically downward half quasi-Cauchy sequences; and a subset E of \textbf{R}, is statistically upward compact if any sequence of points in E has a statistically upward half quasi-Cauchy subsequence, is statistically downward compact if any sequence of points in E has a statistically downward half quasi-Cauchy subsequence where a sequence (x_{n}) of points in \textbf{R} is called statistically upward half quasi-Cauchy if \[ \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\frac{1}{n}|\{k\leq n: x_{k}-x_{k+1}\geq \varepsilon\}|=0 \] is statistically downward half quasi-Cauchy if \[ \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\frac{1}{n}|\{k\leq n: x_{k+1}-x_{k}\geq \varepsilon\}|=0 \] for every \varepsilon>0. We investigate statistically upward continuity, statistically downward continuity, statistically upward half compactness, statistically downward half compactness and prove interesting theorems. It turns out that uniform limit of a sequence of statistically upward continuous functions is statistically upward continuous, and uniform limit of a sequence of statistically downward continuous functions is statistically downward continuous.
