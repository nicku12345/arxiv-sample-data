Our aim is to show the way we pass from the results of ordered semigroups (or semigroups) to ordered \Gamma-semigroups (or \Gamma-semigroups). The results of this note have been transferred from ordered semigroups. The concept of strongly regular po-\Gamma-semigroups has been first introduced here and a characterization of strongly regular po-\Gamma-semigroups is given.
