In this paper an idea of soft linear spaces and soft norm on soft linear spaces are given and some of their properties are studied. Soft vectors in soft linear spaces are introduced and their properties are studied. Completeness of soft normed linear space is also studied and equivalent soft norms and convex soft sets are studied in soft normed linear space settings.
