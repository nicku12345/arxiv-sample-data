This paper deals with the influence of boundary values on the regularity of 3D incompressible Navier-Stokes equation, which is separated into two parts: First part, we consider the potential theory of unsteady 3D Stokes flow. In order to consider Dirichlet and Neumann boundary values, we establish the Green's formula, and then give the double layer and single layer potentials. Second part, based on problems separated and the potential theory we reach the integral representations of the solutions with respect to Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions. Consequently we change the integral representations of solutions from velocity form into vorticity form so that we can construct schemes in favor of numerical computation in this way. Finally we analyze the regularity of the initial-boundary value problems for Navier-Stokes equation, and obtain regular solutions by assuming the regularity on the boundary and data.
