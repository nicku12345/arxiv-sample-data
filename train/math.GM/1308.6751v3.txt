In this article we present method of solving some additive problems with primes. The method may be employed to the Goldbach-Euler conjecture and the twin primes conjecture. The presented method also makes it possible to obtain some interesting results related to the densities of sequences. The method is based on the direct construction of the Eratosthenes-type double sieve and does not use empirical and heuristic reasoning.
