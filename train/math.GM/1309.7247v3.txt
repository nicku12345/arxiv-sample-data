In this article we consider new generalized functions for evaluating integrals and roots of functions. The construction of these generalized functions is based on Rogers-Ramanujan continued fraction, the Ramanujan-Dedekind eta, the elliptic singular modulus and other similar functions. We also provide modular equations of these new generalized functions and remark some interesting properties.
