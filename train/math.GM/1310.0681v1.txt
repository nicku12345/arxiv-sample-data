We introduced and study fuzzy gamma-hypersemigroups, according to fuzzy semihyper- groups as previously defined [33] and prove that results in this respect. In this regard first we introduce fuzzy hyperoperation and then study fuzzy gamma-hypersemigroup. We will proceed by study fuzzy gamma-hyperideals and fuzzy gamma-bihyperideals. Also we study the relation between the classes of fuzzy gamma-hypersemigroups and semigroups. Precisely, we associate a gamma-hypersemigroup to every fuzzy hypersemigroup and vice versa. Finally, we introduce and study fuzzy hypersemigroups regular and fuzzy strongly regular relations of fuzzy gamma-hypersemigroups regular and fuzzy strongly regular relations of fuzzy gamma-hypersemigroups.
