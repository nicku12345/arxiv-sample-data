In this paper, using N-structure, the notion of an N-ideal in a BE-algebra is introduced. Conditions for an N-structure to be an N-ideal are provided. To obtain a more general form of an N-ideal, a point N-structure which is (k conditionally) employed in an N-structure is proposed. Using these notions, the concept of an N-ideal is introduced and related properties are investigated. N-ideal is a generalized form of N-ideal. Characterizations of N-ideals are discussed.
