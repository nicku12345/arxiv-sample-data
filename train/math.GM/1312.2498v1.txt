It has been known that the distribution of the random distances between two uniformly distributed points within a convex polygon can be obtained based on its chord length distribution (CLD). In this report, we first verify the existing known CLD for arbitrary triangles, and then derive and verify the distance distribution between two uniformly distributed points within an arbitrary triangle by simulation. Furthermore, a decomposition and recursion approach is applied to obtain the random point distance distribution between two arbitrary triangles sharing a side. As a case study, the explicit distribution functions are derived when two congruent isosceles triangles with the acute angle equal to \frac{\pi}{6} form a rhombus or a concave 4-gon.
