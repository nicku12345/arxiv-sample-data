A double sequence \{x_{k,l}\} is quasi-Cauchy if given an \epsilon > 0 there exists an N \in {\bf N} such that \max_{r,s= 1\mbox{ and/or} 0} \left \{|x_{k,l} - x_{k+r,l+s}|< \epsilon\right \} . We study continuity type properties of factorable double functions defined on a double subset A\times A of {\bf R}^{2} into \textbf{R}, and obtain interesting results related to uniform continuity, sequential continuity, continuity, and a newly introduced type of continuity of factorable double functions defined on a double subset A\times A of {\bf R}^{2} into \textbf{R}.
