In this paper we will shows the solutions of Navier-Stokes with Oseen theory. The composition of turbulent solutions is a sum of regular solutions in a bounded space. We will show an another demonstration of solutions for Navier-Stokes equations with bounded operator in a Hilbert Functional Space, the base for this work is a Cauchy-Shwarz inequality and Energy Dissipation Inequality.
