A double sequence \textbf{x}=\{x_{k,l}\} of points in \textbf{R} is slowly oscillating if for any given \varepsilon>0, there exist \alpha=\alpha(\varepsilon)>0, \delta=\delta (\varepsilon) >0, and N=N(\varepsilon) such that |x_{k,l}-x_{s,t}|<\varepsilon whenever k,l\geq N(\varepsilon) and k\leq s \leq (1+\alpha)k, l\leq t \leq (1+\delta)l. We study continuity type properties of factorable double functions defined on a double subset A\times A of \textbf{R}^{2} into \textbf{R}, and obtain interesting results related to uniform continuity, sequential continuity, and a newly introduced type of continuity of factorable double functions defined on a double subset A\times A of \textbf{R}^{2} into \textbf{R}.
