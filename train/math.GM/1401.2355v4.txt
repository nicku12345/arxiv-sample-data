The subset of quadratic primes {p = an^2 + bn + c : n => 1} generated by an irreducible polynomial f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c over the integers is widely believed to be an unbounded subset of prime numbers. This note provides the details of a possible proof for some of these quadratic polynomials. In particular, it is shown that the cardinality of the simplest subset of quadratic primes {p = n^2 + 1 : n => 1} is infinite.
