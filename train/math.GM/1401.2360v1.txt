By defining the dimension of natural numbers as the number of prime factors, all natural numbers smaller than 2^(n+1) (n is a natural number) can be classified by their dimensions, and the count of numbers of each dimension gives a dimensions distribution directly related to the distribution of prime numbers. A triangle similar to Pascals triangle from some aspects can be obtained by the ensemble of dimensions distributions. Some superficial explorations have been done to this interesting triangle.
