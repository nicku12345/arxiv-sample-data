The notion of soft sets is introduced as a general mathematical tool for dealing with uncertainty. In this paper, we consider the concepts of soft compactness, countably soft compactness and obtain some results. We study some soft separation axioms that have been studied by Min and Shabir-Naz. By constructing a special soft topological space, show that some classical results in general topology are not true about soft topological spaces, for instance every compact Housdorff spaces need not be normal.
