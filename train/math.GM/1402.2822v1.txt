The Riemann Hypothesis is not proved yet and this article gives a possible proof for the hypothesis which confirms that the only possible nontrivial zeros of the Riemann zeta-function has its real value equal to 1/2. From the result, the application of the Riemann Hypothesis will be certified, e.g. research on prime numbers.
