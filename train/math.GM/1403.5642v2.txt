In this paper, we introduce and study the concepts of semi open SOM) and semi closed (SCM) M-sets in multiset topological spaces.With this generalization of the notions of open and closed sets in M-topology, we generalize the concept of compactness in M-topology as semi compactness. Further semi compactness is generalized as semi whole compactness, semi partial whole compactness and semi full compactness. Some characterizations of these compact spaces are studied in the setting of multiset theory. In each step, several remarks with proper justifications are provided taking the well existing theories of general topology as the base of our study.
