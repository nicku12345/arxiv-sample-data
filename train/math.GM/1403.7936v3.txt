The solution of integro-differential equations have a major role in the fields of science and engineering. Different approaches both numerical and analytic are used to solve these type of equations. In this paper, the solution of fuzzy convolution Volterra integro-differential equation is investigated using fuzzy Laplace transform method under generalized Hukuhara differentiability. Finally, the method is illustrated with few examples to show the ability of the proposed method.
