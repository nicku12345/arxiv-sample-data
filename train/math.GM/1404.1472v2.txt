This paper develops a framework of algebra whereby every Diophantine equation is made quickly accessible by a study of the corresponding row entries in an array of numbers which we call the Newtonian triangles. We then apply this framework to the understandimg of the Fermat's Last Theorem and discuss some of its direct consequences.
