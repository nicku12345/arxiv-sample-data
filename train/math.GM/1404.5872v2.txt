The paper provides the proof of the Rimann's conjecture. The results of the works of A. M. Odlyzko and H. te Riile "Disproof of the Conjecture", which gives a disproof of the Mertens hypothesis, using to prove the Riemann's hypothesis. This paper introduces new finite series of exponential function, which is determined by the even number. The amount of multiple natural numbers is compared with the amount of the functional progression and their numerical value is faund. The paper introduces new concepts in analytic number theory as "natural numbers that overlap". Also, a theorem proved, which gives a more accurate result for "notrivial zeros" than the Riemann's hypothesis.
