Fuzzy partial integro-differential equations have a major role in the fields of science and engineering. In this paper, we propose the solution of fuzzy partial Volterra integro-differential equation with convolution type kernel using fuzzy Laplace transform method (FLTM) under Hukuhara differentiability. It is shown that FLTM is a simple and reliable approach for solving such equations analytically. Finally, the method is illustrated with few examples to show the ability of the proposed method.
