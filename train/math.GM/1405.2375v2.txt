We develop a Helmholtz-like theorem for differential forms in Euclidean space E_{n} using a uniqueness theorem similar to the one for vector fields. We then apply it to Riemannian manifolds, R_{n}, which, by virtue of the Schlaefli-Janet-Cartan theorem of embedding, are here considered as hypersurfaces in E_{N} with N\geq n(n+1)/2. We obtain a Hodge decomposition theorem that includes and goes beyond the original one, since it specifies the terms of the decomposition. We then view the same issue from a perspective of integrability of the system (d\alpha =\mu , \delta \alpha =\nu ), relating boundary conditions to solutions of (d\alpha =0, \delta \alpha =0), [\delta  is what goes by the names of divergence and co-derivative, inappropriate for the Kaehler calculus, with which we obtained the foregoing).
