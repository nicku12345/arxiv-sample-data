1. There is no existing any quadratic interval \eta_{n}:=(n^{2},(n+1)^{2}], which contains less than 2 prime numbers. The number of prime numbers within \eta_{n} goes averagely linear with n to infinity. 2. The exact law of the number \pi(n) of prime numbers smaller or equal to n is given. As an approximation of that we get the prime number theorem of Gauss for great values of n. 3. We derive partition laws for \pi(\eta_{n}), for the number of twin primes \pi_{2}(\eta_{n}) in quadratic intervals \eta_{n} and for the multiplicity \pi_{g}(2n) of representations of Goldbach-pairs for a given even number 2n similiar to the theorem of Gauss. 4. There is no natural number n>7, which is beginning point of a prime number free interval with a length of more than 2{*}SQRT(n). 5. It follows, that the number of twin primes goes to infinity as well as the number of Goldbach-pairs for a given 2n, if n goes to infinity. 6. Besides this our computation gives new proofs for the prime number theorem of Gauss.
