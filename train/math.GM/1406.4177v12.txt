A quantization procedure for the Yang-Mills equations for the Minkowski space \mathbf{R}^{1,3} is carried out in such a way that field maps satisfying Wightman axioms of Constructive Quantum Field Theory can be obtained. Moreover, by removing the ultra violet cut off, the spectrum of the corresponding QCD Hamilton operator is proven to be positive and bounded away from zero, except for the case of the vacuum state, which has vanishing energy level. The whole construction is gauge invariant. The particles corresponding to all solution fields are bosons. As expected from QED, if the coupling constant converges to zero, then so does the mass gap. The results are proved first for the model with the bare coupling constant, and then for a model with a running coupling constant by means of renormalization.
