We take the pre-sieved set to be all natural numbers N=\{1,2,3,\dots\} with a sieve system:single sieve,double sieve,.... With single sieve, i.e. , remove out the multiple of a prime, we derive all the primes. With double sieve, i.e. , remove out the multiple and the multiple of a prime and -2 simultaneously, we get all the prime twins and prove that infinitely many prime twins exist under suitable conditions. Finally, with special 4 sieve, we prove that infinitely many prime twins exist without any restriction.
