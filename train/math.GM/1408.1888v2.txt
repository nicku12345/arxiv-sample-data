In this paper based on a sort of linear function, a deterministic and simple algorithm with an algebraic structure is presented for calculating all (and only) k-almost primes (where \exists n\in {\rm N} , 1{\le} k {\le}n) in certain interval. A theorem has been proven showing a new deterministic property of the category of k-almost primes. Through a linear function that we obtain, an equivalent redefinition of the k-almost primes with an algebraic characteristic is identified. Moreover, as an outcome of our function's property some relations which contain new information about the k-almost primes (including primes) are presented.
