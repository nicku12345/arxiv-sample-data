The theorem proved in this note, although elementary, is related to a certain misconception. If K is a field, f\in K[X] is separable and irreducible over K, and g is a polynomial dividing f, whose coefficients lie in some finite Galois extension of K, it may seem natural to assert that the product of the conjugates of g over K[X] is f. But this assertion is wrong, except in one particular case. In this note, we make the relation between K, f, the product of the conjugates of g, and the coefficient field of g, precise. In particular, it is shown that the product of the conjugates of g over K[X] is equal to f^n, with n\in \mathbb N.
