We show essentially that the differential equation \frac{\partial (P,Q)}{\partial (x,y)} =c \in {\mathbb C}, for P,\,Q \in {\mathbb C}[x,y], may be "integrated", in the sense that it is equivalent to an algebraic system of equations involving the homogeneous components of P and Q. Furthermore, the first equations in this system give explicitly the homogeneous components of Q in terms of those of P. The remaining equations involve only the homogeneous components of P.
