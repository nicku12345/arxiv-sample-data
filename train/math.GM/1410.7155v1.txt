Ranking of intuitionsitic fuzzy number plays a vital role in decision making and other intuitionistic fuzzy applications. In this paper, we propose a new ranking method of intuitionistic fuzzy number based on distance measure. We first define a distance measure for interval numbers based on Lp metric and further generalize the idea for intuitionistic fuzzy number by forming interval with their respective value and ambiguity indices. Finally, some comparative results are given in tabular form.
