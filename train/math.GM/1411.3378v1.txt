In the present article, we show the existence of a coupled fixed point for an order preserving mapping in a preordered left K-complete quasi-pseudometric space using a preorder induced by an appropriate function. We also define the concept of left-weakly related mappings on a preordered space and discuss common coupled fixed points for two and three left-weakly related mappings in the same space. Similar results are given for right-weakly related mappings, the dual notion of left-weakly related mappings.
