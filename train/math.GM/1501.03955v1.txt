We characterize the fuzzy left (resp. right) ideals, the fuzzy ideals and the fuzzy prime (resp. semiprime) ideals of an ordered \Gamma-groupoid M in terms of level subsets and we prove that the cartesian product of two fuzzy left (resp. right) ideals of M is a fuzzy left (resp. right) ideal of M\times M, and the cartesian product of two fuzzy prime (resp. semiprime) ideals of M is a fuzzy prime (resp. semiprime) ideal of M\times M. As a result, if \mu and \sigma are fuzzy left (resp. right) ideals, ideals, fuzzy prime or fuzzy semiprime ideals of M, then the nonempty level subsets (\mu\times\sigma)_t are so.
