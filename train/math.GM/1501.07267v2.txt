Probabilistic models for the distribution of primes in the natural numbers are constructed in the article. The author found and proved the probabilistic estimates of the deviation R(x)=|\pi(x)- Li(x)|. The author has analyzed the probabilistic models of the distribution of primes in the natural numbers and affirmed the validity of the probabilistic estimates of proved deviations R(x) stronger than the estimates made under the assumption of Riemann conjecture. Legendre's conjecture was proved in this paper with probability arbitrarily close to 1 based on the probability estimates. Probabilistic models for the distribution of primes in the arithmetic progression ki+l, (k,l)=1 are also built in this paper. The author has proved the probability estimates for the deviation R(x,k,l)=|\pi(x,k, l)-Li(x)/\varphi(k)|. He has analyzed the probability models of the distribution of primes in the arithmetic progression and affirmed the validity of probabilistic estimates of proved deviations R(x,k,l) stronger than the estimates made under the assumption of the extended Riemann conjecture. Elliott-Halberstam conjecture \sum_{1 \leq k \leq x^a} {\max_{(k,l)=1}[R(x,k,l)]} \leq C x/\ln^A(x) was proved in this paper with probability arbitrarily close to 1 for all 0<a<1 and A>0, based on the probability estimates.
