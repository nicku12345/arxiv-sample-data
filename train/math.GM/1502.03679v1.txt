In this work, exact mathematical functions have been formulated for three important theoretical Shruti (micro tonal interval) distributions, i.e. for Western Compilation, Deval, and Nagoji Row in Hindustani music. A generalized mathematical function for Shrutis has also been formulated. This generalized function shows a very high order of conformity with the experimentally derived Shruti distribution, than those of the theoretical Shruti distributions.
