Rough set theory is a new mathematical approach to imperfect knowledge. The notion of rough sets is generalized by using an arbitrary binary relation on attribute values in information systems, instead of the trivial equality relation. The topology induced by binary relations is used to generalize the basic rough set concepts. This paper studies near approximation via general ordered topological approximation spaces which may be viewed as a generalization of the study of near approximation from the topological view. The basic concepts of some increasing (decreasing) near approximations, increasing (decreasing) near boundary regions and increasing (decreasing) near accuracy were introduced and sufficiently illustrated. Moreover, proved results, implications and add examples.
