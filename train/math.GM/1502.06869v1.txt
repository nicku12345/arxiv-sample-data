We dedicate this paper to investigate the most generalized form of Fibonacci Sequence, one of the most studied sections of the mathematical literature. One can notice that, we have discussed even a more general form of the conventional one. Although it seems the topic in the first section has already been covered before, but we present a different proof here. Later I found out that, the auxiliary theorem used in the first section was proven and even generalized further by F. T. Howard. Thanks to Curtis Cooper for pointing out the fact that this has already been studied and providing me with references. the At first, we prove that, only the common general Fibonacci Sequence can be a divisible sequence under some restrictions. In the latter part, we find some properties of the sequence, prove that there are infinite alternating bisquable Fibonacci sequence(defined later) and provide a lower bound on the number of divisors of Fibonacci numbers.
