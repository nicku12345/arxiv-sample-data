Set out here are some fundamental theories that may be regarded as newly discovered metamathematics of the odd integers in relation to the Collatz conjecture (also called the 3x+1 problem). Originally motivated by the requirement to invent a new optimised integer factorisation method, this foundational paper primarily focuses on the foundation, formalisation and presentation of a new theoretical framework (schema or blueprint) of a Collatz based number system. The proposed framework is based on metamathematical theories meticulously derived through iterative analyses and reverse engineering (i.e., by hand and mathematical computations) of many large subsets of integers. A collation of the fundamental results from these analytical attempts has led to the establishment of a completely deterministic model of a generalised Collatz based number system that is fundamentally and strangely associated with nonchaotic patterns. The proposed Collatz based number schema comprises of both visual and theoretical representations of many hidden patterns in Collatz sequences yet to be reported in literature. This novel theoretical approach may be viewed as a new method to contemporary Collatz conjecture research which may be connected to the proofs of many other mathematical theorems in number theory and discrete mathematics.
