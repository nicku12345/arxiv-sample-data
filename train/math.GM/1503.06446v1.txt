In this paper, we investigate the surfaces generated by binormal motion of Bertrand curves, which is called Razzaboni surface, in Minkowski 3-space. We discussed the geometric properties of these surfaces in M^3 according to the character of Bertrand geodesics. Then, we define the Razzaboni transformation for a given Razzaboni surface. In other words, we prove that there exists a dual of Razzaboni surface for each case. Finally, we show that Razzaboni transformation maps the surface M, which has Bertrand geodesics with constant curvature, to the surface M^* whose Bertrand geodesics also have constant curvature with opposite sign.
