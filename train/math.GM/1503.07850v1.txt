The Homotopy Perturbation Method (HPM) is used to solve the Burgers-Huxley non-linear differential equations. Three case study problems of Burgers-Huxley are solved using the HPM and the exact solutions are obtained. The rapid convergence towards the exact solutions of HPM is numerically shown. Results show that the HPM is efficient method with acceptable accuracy to solve the Burgers-Huxley equation. Also, the results prove that the method is an efficient and powerful algorithm to construct the exact solution of non-linear differential equations.
