It is proved that the Maslov index naturally arises in the framework of PDEs geometry. The characterization of PDE solutions by means of Maslov index is given. With this respect, Maslov index for Lagrangian submanifolds is given on the ground of PDEs geometry. New formulas to calculate bordism groups of (n-1)-dimensional compact sub-manifolds bording via n-dimensional Lagrangian submanifolds of a fixed 2n-dimensional symplectic manifold are obtained too. As a by-product it is given a new proof of global smooth solutions existence, defined on all \mathbb{R}^3, for the Navier-Stokes PDE. Further, complementary results are given in Appendices concerning Navier-Stokes PDE and Legendrian submanifolds of contact manifolds.
