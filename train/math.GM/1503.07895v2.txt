Elliptical rotation is the motion of a point on an ellipse through some angle about a vector. The purpose of this paper is to examine the generation of elliptical rotations and to interpret the motion of a point on an elipsoid using elliptic inner product and elliptic vector product. To generate an elliptical rotation matrix, first we define an elliptical ortogonal matrix and an elliptical skew symmetric matrix using the associated inner product. Then we use elliptic versions of the famous Rodrigues, Cayley, and Householder methods to construct an elliptical rotation matrix. Finally, we define elliptic quaternions and generate an elliptical rotation matrix using those quaternions. Each method is proven and is provided with several numerical examples.
