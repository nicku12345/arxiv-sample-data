Theories of rough sets and soft sets are powerful mathematical tools for modelling various types of vagueness. Hybrid model combining a rough set with a soft set which is called soft rough set proposed by Feng et al. [3] in 2010. In this paper, we study soft covering based rough sets from the topological view. We present under which conditions soft covering lower approximation operation become interior operator and the soft covering upper approximation become closure operator. Also some new methods for generating topologies are obtained. Finally, we study the relationship between concepts of topology and soft covering lower and soft covering upper approximations.
