Let \sigma_n=\lfloor1+n\cdot\log_23\rfloor. For the Collatz 3x + 1 function exists for each n\in\mathbb{N} a set of different residue classes (\text{mod}\ 2^{\sigma_n}) of starting numbers s with finite stopping time \sigma(s)=\sigma_n. Let z_n be the number of these residue classes for each n\geq0 as listed in the OEIS as A100982. It is conjectured that for each n\geq4 the value of z_n is given by the formula \begin{align*} z_n=\frac{(m+n-2)!}{m!\cdot(n-2)!}-\sum_{i=2}^{n-1}\binom{\big\lfloor\frac{3(n-i)+\delta}{2}\big\rfloor}{n-i}\cdot z_i, \end{align*} where m=\big\lfloor(n-1)\cdot\log_23\big\rfloor-(n-1) and \delta\in\mathbb{Z} assumes different values within the sum at intervals of 5 or 6 terms. This allows us to create an iterative algorithm which generates z_n for each n>6.
