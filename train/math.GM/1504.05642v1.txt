A magic square of order n is an nxn square (matrix) whose entries are distinct nonnegative integers such that the sum of the numbers of any row and column is the same number, the magic constant. In this paper we introduce the concept of pseudo magic squares, i.e., magic squares defined over the ring of integers, without the restriction of distinct numbers. Additionally, we generalize this new concept by introducing a group (ring) structure over it. This new approach can provide useful tools in order to find new non-isomorphic pseudo magic squares.
