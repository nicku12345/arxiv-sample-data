Within the scope of elementary number theory, we prove that, as the main result, if 1 \leq x < y < z are integers such that at least one of y, z, x+y is prime then x^{n}+y^{n} \neq z^{n} for every odd integer n \geq 3. This result covers a special case of a conjecture of Abel, and furnishes a definite way to construct infinitely many setwise coprime integers that do not satisfy the Fermat's equation uniformly in n.
