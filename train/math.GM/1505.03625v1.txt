Let A be Banach algebra over commutative ring D. The map f:A\rightarrow A\  is called differentiable in the Gateaux sense, if f(x+a)-f(x)=\partial f(x)\circ a+o(a) where the Gateaux derivative \partial f(x) of map f is linear map of increment a and o is such continuous map that  \lim_{a\rightarrow 0}\frac{|o(a)|}{|a|}=0    Assuming that we defined the Gateaux derivative \partial^{n-1} f(x) of order n-1, we define  \partial^n f(x)\circ(a_1\otimes...\otimes a_n) =\partial(\partial^{n-1} f(x)\circ(a_1\otimes...\otimes a_{n-1}))\circ a_n  the Gateaux derivative of order n of map f. Since the map f(x) has all derivatives, then the map f(x) has Taylor series expansion  f(x)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}(n!)^{-1}\partial^n f(x_0)\circ(x-x_0)^n
