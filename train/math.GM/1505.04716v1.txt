In this paper, we study the differential geometry of null Cartan curves under the similarity transformations in the Minkowski space-time. Besides, we extend the fundamental theorem for a null Cartan curve according to a similarity motion. We find the equations of all self-similar null curves which is given its shape Cartan curvatures.
