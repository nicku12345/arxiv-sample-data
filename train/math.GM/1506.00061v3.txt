In this paper, I treat quadratic equation over associative D-algebra. In quaternion algebra H, the equation x^2=a has either 2 roots, or infinitely many roots. Since a\in R, a<0, then the equation has infinitely many roots. Otherwise, the equation has roots x_1, x_2, x_2=-x_1. I considered different forms of the Viete's theorem and a possibility to apply the method of completing the square.   In quaternion algebra, there exists quadratic equation which either has 1 root, or has no roots.
