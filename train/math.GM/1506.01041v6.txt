Nicolas' criterion for the Riemann Hypothesis (RH) is an inequality based on primorials and the Euler totient function. The aim of this paper is to reformulate Nicolas' criterion and prove the equivalent statement. I will show that the reformulation is bounded and montonic using Chebyshev's function and results on prime numbers. I will then show this equivalent statement does not contradict Cramer's conjecture, which arises naturally when one would prove a specific sequence related to that bound is strictly decreasing.
