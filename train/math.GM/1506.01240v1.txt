Let \mathbb{N}_0 denote the set of all non-negative integers and X be any subset of X. Also denote the power set of X by \mathcal{P}(X). An integer additive set-labeling (IASL) of a graph G is an injective function f:V(G)\to \mathcal{P}(X) such that the induced function f^+:E(G) \to \mathcal{P}(X) is defined by f^+ (uv) = f(u)+ f(v), where f(u)+f(v) is the sumset of f(u) and f(v). An IASL f is said to be a topological IASL (Top-IASL) if f(V(G))\cup \{\emptyset\} is a topology of the ground set X. An IASL is said to be an integer additive set-graceful labeling (IASGL) if for the induced edge-function f^+, f^+(E(G))= \mathcal{P}(X)-\{\emptyset, \{0\}\}. In this paper, we study certain types of IASL of a given graph G, which is a topological integer additive set-labeling as well as an integer additive set-graceful labeling of G.
