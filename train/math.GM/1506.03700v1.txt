An "experimental" study on the randomness of the fractional digits of \pi, e and \phi irrational numbers are presented. This is done by exploiting the 1D Poisson-Voronoi tessellation. We employed two approaches and in both cases, within the numerical error, no differences have been detected between the irrational fractional digits and an equivalent random sequence of digits. The number of tested digits is 1.6 \times 10^7 and 4 \times 10^7 for the first and second approach, respectively. Although not shown here, we investigated several irrational numbers and all of them have displayed a similar behavior.
