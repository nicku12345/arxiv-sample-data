In the present paper we have considered h-Randers conformal change of a Finsler metric  L , which is defined as \begin{center} L(x,y)\rightarrow \bar{L}(x, y)=e^{\sigma(x)}L(x, y)+\beta (x, y), \end{center} where  \sigma(x)  is a function of x, \beta(x, y) = b_{i}(x, y)y^{i} is a 1- form on M^{n} and b_{i} satisfies the condition of being an h-vector. We have obtained the expressions for geodesic spray coefficients under this change. Further we have studied some special Finsler spaces namely quasi-C-reducible, C-reducible, S3-like and S4-like Finsler spaces arising from this metric. We have also obtained the condition under which this change of metric leads a Berwald (or a Landsberg) space into a space of the same kind.
