In this work we apply the Mellin integral representation for the Riemann xi-function, an integral kernel that is essentially a mollified sum of Mobius function, and the Wiener's theorem on approximation to show that the Riemann hypothesis is false. In order to apply the Wiener's theorem on approximation we need to use another copy of the Riemann xi-function as the convergent regularization factor and apply the Banach-Alaoglu theorem to show an integral is zero. A similar approach can be employed to prove if the generalized Riemann hypothesis is true for a primitive Dirichlet character and the L-function is not zero at 1/2, then in the half-plane to the right of the critical line the reciprocal of the L-function as function of t grows faster than any polynomials as t tends to infinity.
