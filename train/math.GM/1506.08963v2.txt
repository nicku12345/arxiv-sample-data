Among other results, the purpose of this article is to show the existence of an \mathbb{R}-space-vector with basis \omega^i_j , i, j are integers such that every graph with n vertex n \geq 3 is the vector: \mathcal{V}(n) = \sum_{j=0}^{n-1} {\alpha^{n-1}_j} \omega^{n-1}_j  where \alpha^{n-1}_j is the number of sub graphs of type \omega^{n-1}_j . We deduce that two graphs are isomorphic if for any measure, they have the same number of maximal proper subset with this measure.
