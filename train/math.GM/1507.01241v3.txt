In this paper we show that a methodology based on a sampling with the Gaussian function of kind h\,{e^{ - {{\left( {t/c} \right)}^2}}}/\left( {{c}\sqrt \pi } \right), where {c} and h are some constants, leads to the Fourier transform that can be represented as a weighted sum of the complex error functions. Due to remarkable property of the complex error function, the Fourier transform based on the weighted sum can be significantly simplified and expressed in terms of a damping harmonic series. In contrast to the conventional discrete Fourier transform, this methodology results in a non-periodic wavelet approximation. Consequently, the proposed approach may be useful and convenient in algorithmic implementation.
