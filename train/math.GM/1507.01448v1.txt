The most general form of the notion of quasi-coincidence of a fuzzy point with a fuzzy subset is considered, and generalization of fuzzy fated of R_0-algebras is discussed. The notion of an (\epsilon , \epsilon \vee q_k)-fuzzy fated filter in an R_0-algebra is introduced, and several properties are investigated. Characterizations of an (\epsilon ,\epsilon \vee q_k)-fuzzy fated filter in an R_0-algebra are discussed. Using a collection of fated filters, a (\epsilon ,\epsilon \vee q_k)-fuzzy fated filter is established.
