This article describes how to calculate exact space-state complexities of Korean chess and Chinese chess. The state-space complexity (a.k.a. search-space complexity) of a game is defined as the number of legal game positions reachable from the initial position of the game. The number of exact space-state complexities are not known for most of games. However, we calculated actual space-state complexities of Korean chess and Chinese chess.
