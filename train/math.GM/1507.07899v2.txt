In this paper, we study the relationship between iterated resultant and multivariate discriminant. We show that, for generic form f(X_n) with even degree d, if the polynomial is squarefreed after each iteration, the multivariate discriminant \Delta(f) is a factor of the squarefreed iterated resultant. In fact, we find a factor Hp(f,[x_1,\ldots,x_n]) of the squarefreed iterated resultant, and prove that the multivariate discriminant \Delta(f) is a factor of Hp(f,[x_1,\ldots,x_n]). Moreover, we conjecture that Hp(f,[x_1,\ldots,x_n])=\Delta(f) holds for generic form f, and show that it is true for generic trivariate form f(x,y,z).
