For a positive integer n, let \mZ be the set of all non-negative integers modulo n and \sP(\mZ) be its power set. A modular sumset valuation or a modular sumset labeling of a given graph G is an injective function f:V(G) \to \sP(\mZ) such that the induced function f^+:E(G) \to \sP(\mZ) defined by f^+ (uv) = f(u)+ f(v). A sumset indexer of a graph G is an injective sumset valued function f:V(G) \to \sP(\mZ) such that the induced function f^+:E(G) \to \sP(\mZ) is also injective. In this paper, some properties and characteristics of this type of modular sumset labeling of graphs are being studied.
