The Dirichlet eta function can be divided into n-th partial sum \eta_{n}(s) and remainder term R_{n}(s). We focus on the remainder term which can be approximated by the expression for n. And then, to increase reliability, we make sure that the error between remainder term and its approximation is reduced as n goes to infinity. According to the Riemann zeta functional equation, if \eta(\sigma+it)=0 then \eta(1-\sigma-it)=0. In this case, n-th partial sum also can be approximated by expression for n. Based on this approximation, we prove the Riemann hypothesis.
