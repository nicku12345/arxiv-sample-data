In Riemann's paper and Nachlass on the zeta function, \pi^{-\frac{s}{2}}\Gamma(\frac{s}{2})\zeta(s) has three different functional expressions, of which \pi^{-\frac{s}{2}}\Gamma(\frac{s}{2})\zeta(s)=2\Re[\pi^{-\frac{s}{2}}\Gamma(\frac{s}{2})f(s)],\qquad\Re(s)=1/2 still has no literature to study it so far. Based on its geometric meaning, we obtain the number of zeros of the Riemann zeta function on the critical line is \frac{T}{2\pi}\log\frac{T}{2\pi}-\frac{T}{2\pi}+\frac{\arg{f(1/2+iT)}}{\pi}+O(T^{-1}). Research shows that Riemann's assertion about ~"One now finds indeed approximate this number of real roots within these limits" comes from this functional expression of \pi^{-\frac{s}{2}}\Gamma(\frac{s}{2})\zeta(s) which associated with the Jacobi function. Finally, this paper analyzes the reason why these conclusions are neglected.
