Based on the concept of new type of statistical convergence defined by Aktuglu, we have introduced the weighted \alpha\beta - statistical convergence of order \theta in case of fuzzy functions and classified it into pointwise, uniform and equi-statistical convergence. We have checked some basic properties and then the convergence are investigated in terms of their \alpha-cuts. The interrelation among them are also established. We have also proved that continuity, boundedness etc are preserved in the equi-statistical sense under some suitable conditions, but not in pointwise sense.
