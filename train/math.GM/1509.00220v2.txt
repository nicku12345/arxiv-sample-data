Given a finite nonempty sequence S of integers, write it as XY^k, where Y^k is a power of greatest exponent that is a suffix of S: this k is the curling number of S. The concept of curling number of sequences has already been extended to the degree sequences of graphs to define the curling number of a graph. In this paper we study the curling number of graph powers, graph products and certain other graph operations.
