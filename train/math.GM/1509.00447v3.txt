In this paper, we present characterizations of totally bounded sets, relatively compact sets and compact sets in the fuzzy sets spaces F_B(\mathbb{R}^m) and F_B(\mathbb{R}^m)^p equipped with L_p metric, where F_B(\mathbb{R}^m) and F_B(\mathbb{R}^m)^p are two kinds of general fuzzy sets on \mathbb{R}^m which do not have any assumptions of convexity or star-shapedness. Subsets of F_B(\mathbb{R}^m)^p include common fuzzy sets such as fuzzy numbers, fuzzy star-shaped numbers with respect to the origin, fuzzy star-shaped numbers, and the general fuzzy star-shaped numbers introduced by Qiu et al. The existed compactness criteria are stated for three kinds of fuzzy sets spaces endowed with L_p metric whose universe sets are the former three kinds of common fuzzy sets respectively. Constructing completions of fuzzy sets spaces with respect to L_p metric is a problem which is closely dependent on characterizing totally bounded sets. Based on preceding characterizations of totally boundedness and relatively compactness and some discussions on convexity and star-shapedness of fuzzy sets, we show that the completions of fuzzy sets spaces mentioned in this paper can be obtained by using the L_p-extension. We also clarify relation among all the ten fuzzy sets spaces discussed in this paper, which consist of five pairs of original spaces and the corresponding completions. Then, we show that the subspaces of F_B(\mathbb{R}^m) and F_B(\mathbb{R}^m)^p mentioned in this paper have parallel characterizations of totally bounded sets, relatively compact sets and compact sets. At last, as applications of our results, we discuss properties of L_p metric on fuzzy sets space and relook compactness criteria proposed in previous work.
