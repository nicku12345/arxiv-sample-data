In this Paper we defined the improved concept of fuzzy magic Graph as the set of two injective functions defined on [0; 1] such that sum of the labeled defined on vertices greater than respective edge label while sum of two vertices and their respective edge must be less than one. Moreover, we investigate some families of fuzzy graphs like fuzzy paths, fuzzy stars and fuzzy cycles which are fuzzy magic graphs.
