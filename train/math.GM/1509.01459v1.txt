This manuscript introduces J_3-numbers, a seemingly missing three-dimensional intermediate between complex numbers related to points in the Cartesian coordinate plane and Hamilton's quaternions in the 4D space. The current development is based on a rotoreflection operator j in \mathbb{R}^3 that induces a novel \circledast-multiplication of triples which turns out to be associative, distributive and commutative. This allows one to regard a point in \mathbb{R}^3 as the three-component J_3-number rather than a triple of real numbers. Being equipped with the \circledast-product, the commutative algebra \mathbb{R}_\circledast^3 is isomorphic to \mathbb{R} \oplus \mathbb{C}. Some geometric and algebraic properties of the J_3-numbers are discussed.
