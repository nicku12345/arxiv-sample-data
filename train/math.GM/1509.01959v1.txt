The solution of non-linear differential equation, non-linear partial differential equation and non-linear fractional differential equation is current research in Applied Science. Here tanh-method and Fractional Sub-Equation methods are used to solve three non-linear differential equations and the corresponding fractional differential equation. The fractional differential equations here are composed with Jumarie fractional derivative. Both the solution is obtained in analytical traveling wave solution form. We have not come across solutions of these equations reported anywhere earlier.
