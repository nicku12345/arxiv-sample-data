The class of bounded variation bv^F(u,v) of fuzzy numbers introduced by [8] has been investigated further with the help of the generalized weighted mean matrix G(u,v). Imposing some restrictions on the matrix G(u,v), we have established it's relation with different class of sequences such as our known classical sets, set of all statistically null difference sequences, Cesaro sequences etc. Also we have examined the concepts like equivalent fuzzy number, symmetric fuzzy number on this quasilinear space.
