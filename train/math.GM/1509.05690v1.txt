The Koch snowflake is one of the first fractals that were mathematically described. It is interesting because it has an infinite perimeter in the limit but its limit area is finite. In this paper, a recently proposed computational methodology allowing one to execute numerical computations with infinities and infinitesimals is applied to study the Koch snowflake at infinity. Numerical computations with actual infinite and infinitesimal numbers can be executed on the Infinity Computer being a new supercomputer patented in USA and EU. It is revealed in the paper that at infinity the snowflake is not unique, i.e., different snowflakes can be distinguished for different infinite numbers of steps executed during the process of their generation. It is then shown that for any given infinite number~n of steps it becomes possible to calculate the exact infinite number, N_n, of sides of the snowflake, the exact infinitesimal length, L_n, of each side and the exact infinite perimeter, P_n, of the Koch snowflake as the result of multiplication of the infinite N_n by the infinitesimal L_n. It is established that for different infinite n and k the infinite perimeters P_n and P_k are also different and the difference can be infinite. It is shown that the finite areas A_n and A_k of the snowflakes can be also calculated exactly (up to infinitesimals) for different infinite n and k and the difference A_n - A_k results to be infinitesimal. Finally, snowflakes constructed starting from different initial conditions are also studied and their quantitative characteristics at infinity are computed.
