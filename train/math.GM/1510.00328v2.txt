A special integro-differential formula (SIDF) of the class of Green's theorems is established for a pair of functional forms (FFs) defined in a real affine Euclidean space of any given dimension n>=1 (nDRAES); one of the FFs is the Green FF for a Poisson equation in the unbounded nDRAES, and the other one is an arbitrary twice-continuously-differentiable time biased (retarded or advanced) FF. The SIDF is an identity, which depends on n, but which is not associated with any specific differential equation for the arbitrary FF. If, however, the latter is assumed to satisfy an inhomogeneous wave equation (IWE) in nDRAES then the SIDF expresses the forced retarded or advanced solution of the IWE if and only if n=3. Based on this fact and also on the pertinent properly defined causality principle, it is concluded that an nDRAES can be regarded as a receptacle of Nature, i.e. as a receptacle of matter along with the principle of special relativity and also along with all metamorphoses, which occur to matter in time in the irreversible direction from past through present to future - metamorphoses that are called physical, chemical, biological, etc. processes - if and only if n=3.
