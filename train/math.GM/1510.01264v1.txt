In this paper, we introduce the concepts of gamma and beta approximations via general ordered topological approximation spaces. Also, increasing (decreasing) gamma and beta boundary, positive and negative regions are given in general ordered topological approximation spaces (GOTAS, for short). Some important properties of them were investigated. From this study, we can say that studying any properties of rough set concepts via GOTAS is a generalization of Pawlak approximation spaces and general approximation spaces.
