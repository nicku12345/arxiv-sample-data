Let S=S_1S_2S_3\ldots S_n be a finite string. Write S in the form XYY\ldots Y=XY^k, consisting of a prefix X (which may be empty), followed by k copies of a non-empty string Y. Then, the greatest value of this integer k is called the curling number of S and is denoted by cn(S). Let the degree sequence of the graph G be written as a string of identity curling subsequences say, X^{k_1}_1\circ X^{k_2}_2\circ X^{k_3}_3 \ldots \circ X^{k_l}_l. The compound curling number of G, denoted cn^c(G) is defined to be, cn^n(G) = \prod\limits^{l}_{i=1}k_i. In this paper, we discuss the curling number and compound curling number of certain products of graphs.
