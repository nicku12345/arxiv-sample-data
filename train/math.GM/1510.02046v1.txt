In this paper, we study non-zero component graph \Gamma(\mathbb{V}) on a finite dimensional vector space \mathbb{V} over a finite field \mathbb{F}. We show that the graph is Hamiltonian and not Eulerian. We also characterize the maximal cliques in \Gamma(\mathbb{V}) and show that there exists two classes of maximal cliques in \Gamma(\mathbb{V}). We also find the exact clique number of \Gamma(\mathbb{V}) for some particular cases. Moreover, we provide some results on size, edge-connectivity and chromatic number of \Gamma(\mathbb{V}).
