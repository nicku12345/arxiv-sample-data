It is shown that the Mean Value Theorem for arithmetic functions, and simple properties of the zeta function are sufficient to assemble proofs of the Prime Number Theorem, and Dirichlet Theorem. These are among the simplest proofs of the asymptotic formulas of the corresponding prime counting functions.
