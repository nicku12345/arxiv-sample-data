Let E \rightarrow M be a smooth vector bundle with a bilinear product on \Gamma(E) satisfying the Jacobi identity. Assuming only the existence of an anchor map \mathfrak{a} we show that \mathfrak{a}([X,Y]) = [\mathfrak{a}X,\mathfrak{a}Y]_c. This gives the redundancy of the homomorphism condition in the definition of Leibniz algebroid; in particular if it arises from a Nambu-Poisson manifold.
