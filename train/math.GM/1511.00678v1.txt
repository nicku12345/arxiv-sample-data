Let \N denote the set of all non-negative integers and \cP(\N) be its power set. An integer additive set-labeling (IASL) of a graph G is an injective set-valued function f:V(G)\to \cP(\N)-\{\emptyset\} such that the induced function f^+:E(G) \to \cP(\N)-\{\emptyset\} is defined by f^+ (uv) = f(u)+ f(v), where f(u)+f(v) is the sumset of f(u) and f(v). A graph which admits an IASL is usually called an IASL-graph. An IASL f of a graph G is said to be an integer additive set-indexer (IASI) of G if the associated function f^+ is also injective. In this paper, we define the notion of integer additive set-labeling of signed graphs and discuss certain properties of signed graphs which admits certain types of integer additive set-labelings.
