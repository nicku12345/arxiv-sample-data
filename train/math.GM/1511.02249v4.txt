In this article, we give the exact interval of the cross section of the Multibrot sets generated by the polynomial z^p+c where z and c are complex numbers and p > 2 is an odd integer. Furthermore, we show that the same Multibrots defined on the hyperbolic numbers are always squares. Moreover, we give a generalized 3D version of the hyperbolic Multibrot set and prove that our generalization is an octahedron for a specific 3D slice of the dynamical system generated by the tricomplex polynomial \eta^p+c where p > 2 is an odd integer.
