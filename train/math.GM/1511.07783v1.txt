We characterize the intra-regular \Gamma-semigroups and the left regular \Gamma-semigroups M in which x\Gamma M\subseteq M\Gamma x for every x\in M in terms of filters and we prove, among others, that every intra-regular \Gamma-semigroup is decomposable into simple components, and every \Gamma-semigroup M for which x\Gamma M\subseteq M\Gamma x is left regular, is decomposable into left simple components.
