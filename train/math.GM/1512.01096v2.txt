Given a finite nonempty sequence S of integers, write it as XY^k, consisting of a prefix X (which may possibly be empty), followed by k copies of a non-empty string Y. Then, the greatest such integer k is called the curling number of S and is denoted by cn(S). The concept of curling number of sequences has already been extended to the degree sequences of graphs to define the curling number of a graph. In this paper we study the curling number of graph powers, graph products and certain other graph operations.
