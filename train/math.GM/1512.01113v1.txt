Let X denote a set of all non-negative integers and \sP(X) be its power set. A weak integer additive set-labeling (WIASL) of a graph G is an injective set-valued function f:V(G)\to \sP(X)-\{\emptyset\} where induced function f^+:E(G) \to \sP(X)-\{\emptyset\} is defined by f^+ (uv) = f(u)+ f(v) such that either |f^+ (uv)|=|f(u)| or |f^+ (uv)|=|f(v)| , where f(u)+f(v) is the sumset of f(u) and f(v). The sparing number of a WIASL-graph G is the minimum required number of edges in G having singleton set-labels. In this paper, we discuss an algorithm for finding the sparing number of arbitrary graphs.
