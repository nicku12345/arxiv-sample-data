In this paper, we propose three similarity measure methods for single valued neutrosophic refined sets and interval neutrosophic refined sets based on Jaccard, Dice and Cosine similarity measures of single valued neutrosophic sets and interval neutrosophic sets. Furthermore, we suggest two multi-criteria decision making method under single valued neutrosophic refined environment and interval neutrosophic refined environment, and give applications of proposed multi-criteria decision making methods. Finally we suggested a consistency analysis method for similarity measures between interval neutrosophic refined sets and give an application to demonstrate process of the method.
