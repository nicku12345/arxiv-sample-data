The objective of this series of papers is to recover information regarding the behaviour of FQ operations in the case n=2, and FQ conform-operations in the case n=3. In this second part we show some arithmetically constructible examples of FQ operations (n=2), concentrating on monoaxiality, related extensions, and (hyper)scaling.
