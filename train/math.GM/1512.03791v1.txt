The objective of this paper is to present an approximation formula for the Katugampola fractional integral, that allows us to solve fractional problems with dependence on this type of fractional operator. The formula only depends on first-order derivatives, and thus we convert the fractional problem into a standard one. With some examples we show the accuracy of the method, and then we present the utility of the method by solving a fractional integral equation.
