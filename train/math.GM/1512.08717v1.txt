In this study,a new method was presented by developing Reduced differential transform method in order to find approximate solution of partial differential equations. Here, RDTM with fixed grid size algorithm was developed for the first time for Reduced Differential Transform Method by dividing solution intervals given to us into fixed grids. The efficiency and advantage of this method was given in homogenous heat equation existing in literature and in the application part on Burgers equation. When approximate solution obtained by this new method and known exact solutions were compared, it is seen that there is definite consistence between both two solutions.
