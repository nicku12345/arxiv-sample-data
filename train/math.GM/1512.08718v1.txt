A global vector field v on a "spacetime" differentiable manifold \mathrm{V}, of dimension N+1, defines a congruence of world lines: the maximal integral curves of v, or orbits. The associated global space \mathrm{N}\_v is the set of these orbits. A "v-adapted" chart on \mathrm{V} is one for which the \mathbb{R}^N vector {\bf x}\equiv (x^j)\ (j=1,...,N) of the "spatial" coordinates remains constant on any orbit l. We consider non-vanishing vector fields v that have non-periodic orbits, each of which is a closed set. We prove transversality theorems relevant to such vector fields. Due to these results, it can be considered plausible that, for such a vector field, there exists in the neighborhood of any point X\in \mathrm{V} a chart \chi  that is v-adapted and "nice", i.e., such that the mapping \bar{\chi }: l\mapsto {\bf x} is injective --- unless v has some "pathological" character. This leads us to define a notion of "normal" vector field. For any such vector field, the mappings \bar{\chi } build an atlas of charts, thus providing \mathrm{N}\_v with a canonical structure of differentiable manifold (when the topology defined on \mathrm{N}\_v is Hausdorff, for which we give a sufficient condition met in important physical situations). Previously, a local space manifold \mathrm{M}\_\mathrm{F} had been associated with any "reference frame" \mathrm{F}, defined as an equivalence class of charts. We show that, if \mathrm{F} is made of nice v-adapted charts, \mathrm{M}\_\mathrm{F} is naturally identified with an open subset of the global space manifold \mathrm{N}\_v.
