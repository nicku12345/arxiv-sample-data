Interval valued bipolar fuzzy weighted neutrosophic set(IVBFWN-set) is a new generalization of fuzzy set, bipolar fuzzy set, neutrosophic set and bipolar neutrosophic set so that it can handle uncertain information more flexibly in the process of decision making. Therefore, in this paper, we propose concept of IVBFWN-set and its operations. Also we give the IVBFWN-set average operator and IVBFWN-set geometric operator to aggregate the IVBFWN-sets, which can be considered as the generalizations of some existing ones under fuzzy, neutrosophic environments and so on. Finally, a decision making algorithm under IVBFWN environment is given based on the given aggregation operators and a real example is used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the method.
