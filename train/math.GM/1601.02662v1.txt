Let X be a non-empty set and \sP(X) be its power set. A set-valuation or a set-labeling of a given graph G is an injective function f:V(G) \to \sP(X) such that the induced function f^{\ast}:E(G) \to \sP(X) defined by f^{\ast} (uv) = f(u)\ast f(v), where \ast is a binary operation on sets. A set-indexer of a graph G is an injective set-valued function f:V(G) \to \sP(X) such that the induced function f^{\ast}:E(G) \to \sP(X) is also injective. In this paper, two types of set-labelings, called conjunctive set-labeling and disjunctive set-labeling, of graphs are introduced and some properties and characteristics of these types of set-labelings of graphs are studied.
