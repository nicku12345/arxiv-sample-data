Let A, B be Banach D-algebras. The map f:A\rightarrow B is called differentiable on the set U\subset A, if at every point x\in U the increment of map f can be represented as f(x+dx)-f(x) =\frac{d f(x)}{d x}\circ dx +o(dx) where \frac{d f(x)}{d x}:A\rightarrow B is linear map and o:A\rightarrow B is such continuous map that \lim_{a\rightarrow 0}\frac{\|o(a)\|_B}{\|a\|_A}=0 Linear map \displaystyle\frac{d f(x)}{d x} is called derivative of map f.   I considered differential forms in Banach Algebra. Differential form \omega\in\mathcal{LA}(D;A\rightarrow B) is defined by map g:A\rightarrow B\otimes B, \omega=g\circ dx. If the map g, is derivative of the map f:A\rightarrow B, then the map f is called indefinite integral of the map g f(x)=\int g(x)\circ dx=\int\omega Then, for any A-numbers a, b, we define definite integral by the equality \int_a^b\omega=\int_{\gamma}\omega for any path \gamma from a to b.
