In this paper, we introduce the integration of algebroidal functions on Riemann surfaces for the first time. Some properties of integration are obtained. By giving the definition of residues and integral function element, we obtain the condition that the integral is independent of path. At last, we prove that the integral of an irreducible algebroidal function is also an irreducible algebroidal function if all the residues at critical points are zeros.
