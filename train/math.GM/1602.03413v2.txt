In this paper, we study the position vectors of rectifying slant helices in E^3. First, we have found the general equations of the curvature and the torsion of rectifying slant helices. After that, we have constructed a second order linear differential equation and by solving the equation, we have obtained a family of rectifying slant helices which lie on cones.
