Let \mathbb{N}_0 denote the set of all non-negative integers and X be any non-empty subset of \mathbb{N}_0. Denote the power set of X by \mathcal{P}(X). An integer additive set-labeling (IASL) of a graph G is an injective set-valued function f:V(G)\to \mathcal{P}(X) such that the induced function f^+:E(G) \to \mathcal{P}(X) is defined by f^+ (uv) = f(u)+ f(v), where f(u)+f(v) is the sumset of f(u) and f(v). If the associated set-valued edge function f^+ is also injective, then such an IASL is called an integer additive set-indexer (IASI). An IASL f is said to be a topological IASL (TIASL) if f(V(G))\cup \{\emptyset\} is a topology of the ground set X. An IASL is said to be an integer additive set-sequential labeling (IASSL) if f(V(G))\cup f^+(E(G))= \mathcal{P}(X)-\{\emptyset\}. An IASL of a given graph G is said to be a topological integer additive set-sequential labeling of G, if it is a topological integer additive set-labeling as well as an integer additive set-sequential labeling of G. In this paper, we study the conditions required for a graph G to admit this type of IASL and propose some important characteristics of the graphs which admit this type of IASLs.
