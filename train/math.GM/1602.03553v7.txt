This article proves the Riemann hypothesis, which states that all non-trivial zeros of the zeta function have a real part equal to 1/2. We inspect in detail the integral form of the (symmetrized) completed zeta function, which is a product between the zeta and gamma functions. It is known that two integral lines, expressing the completed zeta function, rotated from the real axis in the opposite directions, can be shifted without affecting the completed zeta function owing to the residue theorem. The completed zeta function is regular in the region of the complex plane under consideration. For convenience in the subsequent singularity analysis of the above integral, we first deform and shift the integral contours. We then investigate the singularities of the composite elements (caused by polynomial integrals in opposite directions), which appear only in the case for which the distance between the contours and the origin of the coordinates approaches zero. The real part of the zeros of the zeta function is determined to be 1/2 along a symmetry line from the singularity removal condition. (In the other points, the singularities are adequately cancelled as a whole to lead to a finite value.)
