Recall that the minimum number of colors that allow a proper coloring of graph G is called the chromatic number of G and denoted by \chi(G). In this paper the concepts of \chi'-chromatic sum and \chi^+-chromatic sum are introduced. The extended graph G^x of a graph G was recently introduced for certain regular graphs. We further the concepts of \chi'-chromatic sum and \chi^+-chromatic sum to extended paths and cycles. The paper concludes with \emph{patterned structured} graphs.
