In the present paper, we find a surface family possessing the natural lift of a given timelike curve as a asymptotic in Minkowski 3-space. We express necessary and sufficient conditions for the given curve such that its natural lift is a asymptotic on any member of the surface family. Finally, we illustrate the method with some examples.
