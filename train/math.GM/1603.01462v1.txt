In our recent publications we have introduced the incomplete cosine expansion of the sinc function for efficient application in sampling [Abrarov & Quine, Appl. Math. Comput., 258 (2015) 425-435; Abrarov & Quine, J. Math. Research, 7 (2) (2015) 163-174]. Here we show that it can also be utilized as a flexible and efficient tool in mathematical analysis. In particular, an application of the incomplete cosine expansion of the sinc function leads to expansion series of the error function in form of a sum of the Gaussian functions. This approach in integration provides a new asymptotic formula for the constant \pi.
