We have shown recently that integration of the error function {\rm{erf}}\left( x \right) represented in form of a sum of the Gaussian functions provides an asymptotic expansion series for the constant pi. In this work we derive a rational approximation of the arctangent function \arctan \left( x \right) that can be readily generalized it to its counterpart  - {\rm{sgn}}\left( x \right)\pi /2 + \arctan \left( x \right), where {\rm{sgn}}\left( x \right) is the signum function. The application of the expansion series for these two functions leads to a new asymptotic formula for \pi.
