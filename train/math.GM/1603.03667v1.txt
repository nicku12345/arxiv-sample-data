Let a\in (0,1) and let F_s(a) be the periodized zeta function that is defined as F_s(a) = \sum n^{-s} \exp (2\pi i na) for \Re s >1, and extended to the complex plane via analytic continuation. Let s_n = \sigma_n + it_n, \, t_n >0 , denote the sequence of nontrivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function in the upper halfplane ordered according to nondecreasing ordinates. We demonstrate that, assuming the Riemann Hypothesis, the Ces\`{a}ro means of the sequence F_{s_n} (a) converge to the first harmonic \exp (2\pi i a) in the sense of periodic distributions. This reveals a natural broadband structure of the pure tone. The proof involves Fujii's refinement of the classical Landau theorem related to the uniform distribution modulo one of the nontrivial zeros of \zeta.
