In this paper, two recursion formulae of chromatic polynomial of a maximal planar graph G are obtained. Moreover, the application of these formulaes to the proof of Four-Color Conjecture is investigated. By using these formulae, the proof of Four-Color Conjecture boils down to the study on a special class of graphs, viz., 4-chromatic-funnel pseudo uniquely-4-colorable maximal planar graphs.
