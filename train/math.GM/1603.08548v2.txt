In this article, we give the exact interval of the cross section of the Multibrot sets generated by the polynomial z^p+c where z and c are complex numbers and p \geq 2 is an even integer. Furthermore, we show that the same Multibrots defined on the hyperbolic numbers are always squares. Moreover, we give a generalized 3D version of the hyperbolic Multibrot set and prove that our generalization is an octahedron for a specific 3D slice of the tricomplex polynomial \eta^p+c where p \geq 2 is an even integer.
