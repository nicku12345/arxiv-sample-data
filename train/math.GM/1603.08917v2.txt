This paper proves Firoozbakht's conjecture using Rosser and Schoenfelds' inequality on the distribution of primes. This inequality is valid for all natural numbers {n\geq 21}. Firoozbakht's conjecture states that if  {p_{n}} and {p_{(n+1)}} are consecutive prime numbers, then {p_{(n+1)}^{1/(n+1)}< p_{n}^{1/n}} for every {n\geq 1}. Rosser's inequality for the {n}th and {(n+1)}th roots, changes from strictly increasing to strictly decreasing for {n\geq 21}. The inequality is considered for {n>e^{e^{3/2}}}, i.e., {n\geq 89}, but since the inequalities for {n\geq 195340>e^{e^{5/2}}}, are also required, these inequalities are explicitly proven as well. Silva has already verified Firoozbakht's conjecture up to {p_{n}<4 \times 10^{18}}, and the additional theorem is proven here that there is the smallest natural number, {m>n\geq 1} and {p_{m}^{1/m}< p_{n}^{1/n}}. It is also shown that there is a unique one to one function, which maps each element {p_n} to each element {p_{n}^{1/n}} for every {n\geq 1} and {1<p_{n}^{1/n}\leq 2}. Finally, it is proved that there is a strictly decreasing sequence and Firoozbakht's conjecture would be true for all {n\geq 1}.
