Consider a network D of pipes which have to be cleaned using some cleaning agents, called brushes, assigned to some vertices. The tattooing of a simple connected directed graph D is a particular type of the cleaning in which an arc are coloured by the colour of the colour-brush transiting it and the tattoo number of D is a corresponding derivative of brush numbers in it. In this paper, we introduce a new concept, called the tattoo index of a given graph G, which is an efficiency index related to the tattooing sequence and we establish some introductory results on this parameter.
