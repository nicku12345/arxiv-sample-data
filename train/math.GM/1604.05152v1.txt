The concept of weighted \beta\gamma - summability of order \theta in case of fuzzy functions is introduced and classified into ordinary and absolute sense. Several inclusion relations among the sets are investigated. Also we have found some suitable conditions to get its relation with the generalized statistical convergence. Finally we have proved a generalized version of Tauberian theorem.
