The scope of the paper is the theoretical analysis of the time rate in which a dynamical system reaches a stable stationary state or stable oscillations. The method used for the analysis is based on the so-called iterative time profiles, demonstrating a chaotic and fractal nature of some of the profiles. The results were presented in the form of two and three-dimensional graphs.
