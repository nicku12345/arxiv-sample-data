The paper discusses a simple method of using the parametric continuation method to designate complex diagrams of steady states. The main advantage of the discussed approach is the fact that it does not require the installation of huge professional IT systems. The deliberations are illustrated by examples of a reactor models described by the algebraic and differential equations. Both models render solutions in the form of the so called multiple steady states.
