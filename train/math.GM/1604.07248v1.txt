Various forms of Mean Value Theorems are available in the literature. If we use Flett's Mean Value Theorem in Extended Generalized Mean Value Theorem then what would the new theorem look like. A sincere effort is done to develop this theorem. This theorem is named as Extended Generalized Flett's Mean Value Theorem.
