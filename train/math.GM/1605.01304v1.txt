In this paper, we study composite mapping on hesitant fuzzy soft classes. We also establish some interesting properties of this notion and support them with examples. Also definitions of fuzzy soft image and fuzzy soft inverse image put forward by Kharal and Ahmad \cite{kharal} have been reintroduced in hesitant fuzzy soft classes.
