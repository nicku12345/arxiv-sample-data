In this work, fuzzy Linear programming problems (FLPP) and their implementations is being done in two person zero-sum fuzzy matrix game theory, based on Bector, Chandra and Vijay [2] model. Verification of solution of all possible type of two person zero-sum game is done by solving examples by numerical method.   Generalized fuzzy set first introduced by Atanassov (1986) which is called I-fuzzy set has been studied and using this knowledge, application in (FLPP) and two person zero-sum matrix game with I-fuzzy goals is given. At the end I gave useful MATLAB codes for solving all three type of two person zero-sum fuzzy matrix games, with fuzzy goals, with fuzzy pay-offs and with both fuzzy goals and fuzzy pay-offs.
