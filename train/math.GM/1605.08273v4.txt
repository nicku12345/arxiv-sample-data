In this paper, we briefly review most of accomplished research in Riemann Zeta function and Riemann hypothesis since Riemann's age including Riemann hypothesis equivalences as well. We then make use of Robin and Lagarias' criterions to prove Riemann hypothesis. The goal is, applying Lagarias criterion for n\geq 1 since Lagarias criterion states that Riemann hypothesis holds if and only if the inequality \sum_{d|n}d\leq H_{n}+\exp(H_{n})\log(H_{n}) holds for all n\geq 1. Although, Robin's criterion is applied as well. Our approach breaks up the set of natural numbers into three main subsets. The first subset is \{n\in \mathbb{N}| ~ 1\leq n\leq 5040\}. The second one is \{n\in \mathbb{N}| ~ 5041\leq n\leq 19685\} and third one is \{n\in \mathbb{N}| ~ n\geq 19686\}. In our proof, the third subset for even integers is broken up into odd integer class numbers. Then, mathematical arguments are stated for each odd integer class number. Odd integer class number is introduced in this paper. Since the Lagarias criterion holds for the first subset regarding computer aided computations, we do prove it using both Lagarias and Robin's criterions for the second and third subsets and mathematical arguments accompanied by a large volume of computer language programs. It then follows that Riemann hypothesis holds as well.
