We approach a new proof of the strong Goldbach's conjecture for sufficiently large even integers by applying the Dirichlet's series. Using the Perron formula and the Residue Theorem in complex variable integration, one could show that any large even integer is demonstrated as a sum of two primes. In this paper,the Riemann Hypothesis is assumed to be true in throughout the paper. A novel function is defined on the natural numbers set.This function is a typical sieve function.Then based on this function,several new functions are represented and using the Prime Number Theorem,Sabihi's theorem, and the Sabihi's second conjecture,the strong Goldbach's conjecture is proved for sufficiently large even integers.
