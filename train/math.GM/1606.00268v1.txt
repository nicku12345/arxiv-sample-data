Let \mathcal{C} = \{c_1,c_2, c_3, \ldots,c_k\} be a certain type of proper k-colouring of a given graph G and \theta(c_i) denote the number of times a particular colour c_i is assigned to the vertices of G. Then, the colouring sum of a given graph G with respect to the colouring \cC, denoted by \omega_{\cC}(G), is defined to be \omega(\cC) = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{k}i\,\theta(c_i). The colouring sums such as \chi-chromatic sum, \chi^+-chromatic sum, b-chromatic sum, b^+-chromatic sum etc. are some of these types of colouring sums that have been studied recently. Motivated by these studies on certain chromatic sums of graphs, in this paper, we study certain chromatic sums for some standard cycle related graphs.
