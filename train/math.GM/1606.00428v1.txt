We introduce the concepts of fuzzy right and fuzzy left ideals of hypergroupoids and the concept of a fuzzy bi-ideal of an hypersemigroup and we show that a fuzzy subset f of an hypergroupoid H is a fuzzy right (resp. fuzzy left) ideal of H if and only if f\circ 1\preceq f (resp. 1\circ f\preceq f) and for an hypersemigroup H, a fuzzy subset f of H is a bi-ideal of H if and only if f\circ 1\circ f\preceq f. These characterizations are very useful for the investigation. The paper serves as an example to show the way we pass from fuzzy groupoids (semigroups) to fuzzy hypergroupoids (hypersemigroups).
