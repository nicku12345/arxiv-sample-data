In this paper, the existence of coincidence points and common fixed points for multivalued mappings satisfying certain graphic {\psi}-contraction contractive conditions with set-valued domain endowed with a graph, without appealing to continuity, is established. Some examples are presented to support the results proved herein. Our results unify, generalize and extend various results in the existing literature.
