The aim of this paper is to construct a fractal with the help of a finite family of generalized F-contraction mappings, a class of mappings more general than contraction mappings, defined in the setup of b-metric space. Consequently, we obtain a variety of results for iterated function system satisfying a different set of contractive conditions. Our results unify, generalize and extend various results in the existing literature.
