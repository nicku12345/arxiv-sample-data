In this article, we study coupled fixed point theorems in newly appeared JS-metric spaces. It is important to note that the class of JS-metric spaces includes standard metric space, dislocated metric space, b-metric space etc. The purpose of this paper is to present several coupled fixed point results in a more general way. Moreover, the techniques used in our proofs are indeed different from the comparable existing literature. Finally, we present a non- trivial example to validate our main result.
