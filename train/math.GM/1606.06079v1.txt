We prove that an hypersemigroup H is regular if and only, for any fuzzy subset f of H, we have f\preceq f\circ 1\circ f and it is intra-regular if and only if, for any fuzzy subset f of H, we have f\preceq 1\circ f\circ f\circ 1. An hypersemigroup H is left (resp. right) quasi-regular if and only if, for any fuzzy subset f of S we have f\preceq 1\circ f\circ 1\circ f (resp. f\preceq f\circ 1\circ f\circ 1) and it is semisimple if and only if, for any fuzzy subset f of S we have f\preceq 1\circ f\circ 1\circ f\circ 1. The characterization of regular and intra-regular hypersemigroups in terms of fuzzy subsets are very useful for applications.
