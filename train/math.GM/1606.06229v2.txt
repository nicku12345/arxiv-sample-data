In this work we find a solution to problem of the heat equation which is annihiliated at a cubic boundary f. The solution turns out to be the convolution between the fundamental solution of the heat equation and a function \phi which solves a third order ODE. However we believe that the main contribution is the procedure itself, which links in a rather straightforward way, solutions of the heat equation v with moving boundaries f through the convolution of the heat kernel with \mathbb{C}^p funtions \phi.
