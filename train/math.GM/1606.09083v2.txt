In this present article, we get sufficient conditions for the existence and uniqueness of fixed points and common fixed points for single and double mapping satisfying various contractive conditions within the partially ordered 0-G_p-complete G_p-metric spaces. Our theorems generalize some fixed point results existing in the literature. Furthermore, we give some examples supporting our results.
