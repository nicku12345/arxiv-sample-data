In this paper, we introduce the notion of an energy graph as a simple, directed and vertex labeled graph G such that the arcs (v_i, v_j) \notin A(G) if i > j for all distinct pairs v_i,v_j and at least one vertex v_k exists such that d^-(v_k)=0. Initially, equal amount of potential energy is allocated to certain vertices. Then, at a point of time these vertices transform the potential energy into kinetic energy and initiate transmission to head vertices. Upon reaching a head vertex, perfect elastic collisions with atomic particles take place and propagate energy further. Propagation rules apply which result in energy dissipation. This dissipated energy is called black energy. The notion of the black arc number of a graph is also introduced in this paper. Mainly Jaco-type graphs are considered for the application of the new concepts.
