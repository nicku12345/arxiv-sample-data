By the second mean-value theorem of calculus (Gauss-Bonnet theorem) we prove that the class of functions {\mit \Xi}(z) with an integral representation of the form \int_{0}^{+\infty}du\,{\mit \Omega}(u)\,{\rm ch}(uz) with a real-valued function {\mit \Omega}(u) \ge 0 which is non-increasing and decreases in infinity more rapidly than any exponential functions \exp\left(-\lambda u\right),\,\lambda >0 possesses zeros only on the imaginary axis. The Riemann zeta function \zeta(s) as it is known can be related to an entire function \xi(s) with the same non-trivial zeros as \zeta(s). Then after a trivial argument displacement s\leftrightarrow z=s-\frac{1}{2} we relate it to a function {\mit \Xi}(z) with a representation of the form {\mit \Xi}(z)=\int_{0}^{+\infty}du\,{\mit \Omega}(u)\,{\rm ch}(uz) where {\mit \Omega}(u) is rapidly decreasing in infinity and satisfies all requirements necessary for the given proof of the position of its zeros on the imaginary axis z={\rm i} y by the second mean-value theorem. Besides this theorem we apply the Cauchy-Riemann differential equation in an integrated operator form derived in the Appendix B. All this means that we prove a theorem for zeros of {\mit \Xi}(z) on the imaginary axis z={\rm i} y for a whole class of function {\mit \Omega}(u) which includes in this way the proof of the Riemann hypothesis. This whole class includes, in particular, the modified Bessel functions {\rm I}_{\nu}(z) for which it is known that their zeros lie on the imaginary axis and which affirms our conclusions. A class of almost-periodic functions to piece-wise constant nonincreasing functions {\rm \Omega}(u) belongs also to this case. At the end we give shortly an equivalent way of a more formal description of the obtained results using the Mellin transform of functions with its variable substituted by an operator.
