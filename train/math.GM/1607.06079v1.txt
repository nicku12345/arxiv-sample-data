B\"acklund transformations (BTs) are traditionally regarded as a tool for integrating nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs). Their use has been recently extended, however, to problems such as the construction of recursion operators for symmetries of PDEs, as well as the solution of linear systems of PDEs. In this article, the concept and some applications of BTs are reviewed. As an example of an integrable linear system of PDEs, the Maxwell equations of electromagnetism are shown to constitute a BT connecting the wave equations for the electric and the magnetic field; plane-wave solutions of the Maxwell system are constructed in detail. The connection between BTs and recursion operators is also discussed.
