I define Goldbach counting function with N > 0 and square-free P > 0. Decomposition of this function is discovered and deduction formula is found. I propose a hypothesis on upper bound of Goldbach counting function and prove that Goldbach conjecture is true under this hypothesis. Also, I propose a second hypothesis on upper bound of Goldbach counting function and prove that the twin prime conjecture is true under this hypothesis
