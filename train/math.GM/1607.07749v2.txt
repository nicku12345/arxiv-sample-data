Objective of this paper is to introduce a new type of calculus which will be called G-Calculus based on non-Newtonian calculus introduced by Grossman and Katz \cite{GrossmanKatz}. The basic difference between geometric calculus defined by Grossman and Katz and the present G-calculus is that Grossman took the values of the argument as x, x+ h, x+2h,... but here in G-calculus we take the values as x, x\oplus h, x\oplus e^2\odot h, x\oplus e^3\odot h.... This calculus will have great deal with numerical analysis which are discussed in the last section of this paper.
