\begin{abstract} \pi, the ratio between a circumference and is radius, is an irrational transcendental number. Fractal analysis is used here to show that \pi\textquoteright{s} digit sequence corresponds to a uniformly distributed random succession of independent decimal digits, and that these properties get clearer as the number of digits in the series grows towards infinity;  10^9  digits were tested in this work. This indicates that  \pi  is normal.
