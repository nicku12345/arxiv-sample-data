The concepts of linear Jaco graphs and Jaco-type graphs have been introduced as certain types of directed graphs with specifically defined adjacency conditions. The distinct difference between a pure Jaco graph and a Jaco-type graph is that for a pure Jaco graph, the total vertex degree d(v) is well-defined, while for a Jaco-type graph the vertex out-degree d^+(v) is well-defined. Hence, in the case of pure Jaco graphs a challenge is to determine d^-(v) and d^+(v) respectively and for Jaco-type graphs a challenge is to determine d^-(v). In this paper, the vertex in-degrees for Fibonaccian and modular Jaco-type graphs are determined.
