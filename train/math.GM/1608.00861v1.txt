The union of a collection of n sets is generally expressed in terms of a characteristic (indicator) function that contains 2^{n}-1 terms. In this article, a much simpler expression is found that requires the evaluation of n terms only. This leads to a major simplification of any normal form involving characteristic functions of sets. The formula can be useful in recognizing inclusion-exclusion patterns of combinatorial problems.
