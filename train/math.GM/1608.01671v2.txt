A new derivation of Golomb's limit formula for generating the nth+1 prime number is presented. The limit formula is derived by extracting p_{n+1} from Euler's prime product representation of the Riemann zeta function \zeta(s) in the limit as s approaches infinity. Also, new variations of these limit formulas are explored, such as the logarithm and a half-prime formulas for the p_{n+1}.
