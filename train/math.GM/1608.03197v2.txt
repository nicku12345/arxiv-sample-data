Tools of the intrinsic analysis on manifolds, helpful in solving the invariant inverse problem of the calculus of variations are being presented comprising a combined approach which consists in the simultaneous imposition of symmetry principles and the inverse variational problem considerations in terms of vector-valued differential forms. In three-dimensional space-time we obtain a unique (covector) third-order Poincar\'e-invariant variational equation, which then is identified with the motion of a free relativistic top in flat three-dimensional space-time.
