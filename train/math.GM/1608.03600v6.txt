This paper enumerate some numerical findings concerning the repetitive patterns arising in the so-called Collatz path sequences. This is followed by a closed form finite state machine (FSM) model of these recurrences using a set of linear congruence equations resulting in a different terminating condition for the Collatz problem. The completeness of the problem in these finite number of recurrent forms (here, six recurrent forms), such that the elements of the Collatz path sequence switches in-between till one of them reaches a number of the form 2m is shown. Further, by using heuristic analysis on the frequency distribution of these recurrence forms, the manifestation of statistical bias and constructive analytical formulation and convergence for some of these recurrent forms is exhibited. Unlike many other approaches described in literature, the present contribution illustrates the existence of a recurrence quantification of the Collatz conjecture. Also if the presented analysis can be made rigorous to solve the set of linear congruence equations for the Collatz FSM model, the exact true nature of Collatz problem can be inferred.
