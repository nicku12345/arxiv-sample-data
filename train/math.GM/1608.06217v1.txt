A method is given for estimating clamped plane elastica. Arguments are made, and evidence is provided by way of illustrative examples, suggesting that the new method is quicker and more robust than standard discretisation, and more likely to give elastica of low energy. Just as for standard discretisation, no use is made of the known solutions for elastica in terms of elliptic functions.
