In this paper, we analyze properties of special subsequences of prime numbers produced by the alternating sum of higher-order subsets of the primes. We also introduce a sieve which will generate these subsequences via the systematic selection and elimination of prime number indexes from the real number line. We then derive estimates of the average gaps between the primes in these subsequences at infinity and consider their classification as either a small or a large set.
