Let X denotes a set of non-negative integers and \mathscr{P}(X) be its power set. An integer additive set-labeling (IASL) of a graph G is an injective set-valued function f:V(G)\to \mathscr{P}(X)-\{\emptyset\} such that the induced function f^+:E(G) \to \mathscr{P}(X)-\{\emptyset\} is defined by f^+(uv)=f(u)+f(v);\ \forall\, uv\in E(G), where f(u)+f(v) is the sumset of f(u) and f(v). An IASL of a signed graph is an IASL of its underlying graph G together with the signature \sigma defined by \sigma(uv)=(-1)^{|f^+(uv)|};\ \forall\, uv\in E(\Sigma). In this paper, we discuss certain characteristics of the signed graphs which admits certain types of integer additive set-labelings.
