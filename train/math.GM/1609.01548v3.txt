This paper presents a theorem which solves the problem of reduction of the determinant order by means of a transformation of it, into other determinant whose each element are a determinant of second order. This implies that, if the process continues, desired result is obtained by solving always determinants of second order. It also assesses the degree of efficiency compared to the method by minors and with the method of Gauss, as well as the ability to reflect small variations in the data. This method should have a good impact also in the area of teaching mathematics, due to its ease of assimilation and application.
