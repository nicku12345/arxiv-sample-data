In this paper, we discuss existence of Hukuhara differentiability of fuzzy-valued functions. Several examples are worked out to check that fuzzy-valued functions are one time, two times and n-times H-differentiable. We study the effects of fuzzy modelling on existence of Hukuhara differentiability of fuzzy-valued functions. We discuss existence of gH-differentiability and its comparison with H-differentiability.
