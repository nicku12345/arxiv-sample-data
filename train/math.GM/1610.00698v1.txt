Let X be a non-empty ground set and \mathcal{P}(X) be its power set. A set-labeling (or a set-valuation) of a graph G is an injective set-valued function f:V(G)\to \mathcal{P}(X) such that the induced function f^\oplus:E(G) \to \mathcal{P}(X) is defined by f^\oplus(uv) = f(u)\oplus f(v), where f(u)\oplus f(v) is the symmetric difference of the sets f(u) and f(v). A graph which admits a set-labeling is known to be a set-labeled graph. A set-labeling f of a graph G is said to be a set-indexer of G if the associated function f^\oplus is also injective. In this paper, we define the notion of set-valuations of signed graphs and discuss certain properties of signed graphs which admits certain types of set-valuations.
