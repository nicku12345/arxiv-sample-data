In the present study, we solve initial boundary value problem construted on nonlinear Klein-Gordon equation. The collocation method on exponential cubic B-spline functions forming a set of basis for the functions defined in the same interval is set up for the numerical approach. The efficiency and validity of the proposed method are determined by computing the error between the numerical and the analytical solutions. The preservation of conserved quantities is also a good indicator of validity of the method.
