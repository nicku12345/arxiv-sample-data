In this paper we present a new identity and some of its variants which can be used for finding solutions while solving fractional infinite and finite series. We introduce another simple identity which is capable of generating solutions for some finite series. We demonstrate a method for generation of variants of the identities based on the findings. The identities are useful for solving various infinite products.
