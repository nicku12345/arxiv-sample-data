A generalization of classical cubic B-spline functions with a parameter is used as basis in the collocation method. Some initial boundary value problems constructed on the nonlinear Klein-gordon equation are solved by the proposed method for extension various parameters. The coupled system derived as a result of the reduction of the time order of the equation is integrated in time by the Crank-Nicolson method. After linearizing the nonlinear term, the collocation procedure is implemented. Adapting the initial conditions provides a linear iteration system for the fully integration of the equation. The validity of the method is investigated by measuring the maximum errors between analytical and the numerical solutions. The absolute relative changes of the conservation laws describing the energy and the momentum are computed for both problems.
