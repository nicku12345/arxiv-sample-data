For a colour cluster \mathbb{C} =(\mathcal{C}_1,\mathcal{C}_2, \mathcal{C}_3,\ldots,\mathcal{C}_\ell), where \mathcal{C}_i is a colour class such that |\mathcal{C}_i|=r_i, a positive integer, we investigate two types of simple connected graph structures G^{\mathbb{C}}_1, G^{\mathbb{C}}_2 which represent graphical embodiments of the colour cluster such that the chromatic numbers \chi(G^{\mathbb{C}}_1)=\chi(G^{\mathbb{C}}_2)=\ell and \min\{\varepsilon(G^{\mathbb{C}}_1)\}=\min\{\varepsilon(G^{\mathbb{C}}_2)\} =\sum\limits_{i=1}^{\ell}r_i-1. Therefore, the problem is the edge-minimality inverse to finding the chromatic number of a given simple connected graph. In this paper, we also discuss the chromatic Zagreb indices corresponding to G^{\mathbb{C}}_1, G^{\mathbb{C}}_2.
