In this paper, we introduce notion of fuzzy soft number. Here defined fuzzy soft number and four arithmetric operations  \tilde{+}, \tilde{-}, \tilde{\times}, \tilde{\div}  and related properties. Also introduce Hausdorff distance, Fuzzy soft metric space, convergence sequence, Cauchy sequence, Continuity and uniform continuity of fuzzy soft numbers. At starting of this paper, we study convex and concave fuzzy soft sets and some of their properties.
