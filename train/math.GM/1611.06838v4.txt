To allow for Division By Zero, we develop a new algebraic structure containing addition and multiplication called an S-Extension of a Field. This unique structure extends a Field so that the equation 0\cdot s=x has exactly one solution for every non-zero Field element x. Furthermore, a different solution is obtained for each choice of x, making this solution unique to that particular equation. However, the equation 0\cdot s=0 has two or more solutions, with no preference towards any one particular solution. This allows us to use the usual definition of division as the solution to the equation 0\cdot s=x to evaluate x divided by 0. And if x\not=0, every {x\over 0} is a unique element that is also unique to that particular x while {0\over 0} remains indeterminate. This creates a Division By Zero which significantly differs from other attempts at Division By Zero.
