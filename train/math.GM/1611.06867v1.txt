The paper deals with the process of mathematical modeling representations of exponential and logarithmic functions hypercomplex number system of generalized quaternions via determining a linear differential equation with hypercomplex coefficients. Simulation is performed using symbolic computation system Maple. Some properties of these concepts and their relation to the exponential representations of specific non-commutative hypercomplex number systems of dimension four.
