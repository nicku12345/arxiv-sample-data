In the present study, we derive the problem of constructing a hypersurface family from a given isogeodesic curve in the 4D Galilean space \mathbf{G}_{4}. We obtain the hypersurface as a linear combination of the Frenet frame in \mathbf{G}_{4} and examine the necessary and sufficient conditions for the curve as a geodesic curve. Finally, some examples related to our method are given for the sake of clarity.
