This analysis which uses new mathematical methods aims at proving the Riemann hypothesis and figuring out an approximate base for imaginary non-trivial zeros of zeta function at very large numbers, in order to determine the path that those numbers would take. This analysis will prove that there is a relation links the non-trivial zeros of zeta with the prime numbers, as well as approximately pointing out the shape of this relationship, which is going to be a totally valid one at numbers approaching infinity.
