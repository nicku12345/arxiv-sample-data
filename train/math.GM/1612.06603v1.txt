The concept of Type-2 soft sets had been proposed as a generalization of Molodstov's soft sets. In this paper some shortcomings of some existing distance measures for Type-1 soft sets have been shown and accordingly some new distance measures have been proposed. The axiomatic definitions for distance, entropy and similarity measures for Type-2 soft sets have been introduced and a couple of such measures have been defined. Also the applicability of one of the proposed similarity measures have been demonstrated by showing its utility as an effective tool in a decision making problem.
