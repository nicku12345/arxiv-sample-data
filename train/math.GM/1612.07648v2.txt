The congruence lattices of all algebras defined on a fixed finite set A ordered by inclusion form a finite atomistic lattice \mathcal E. We describe the atoms and coatoms. Each meet-irreducible element of \mathcal E being determined by a single unary mapping on A, we characterize completely those which are determined by a permutation or by an acyclic mapping on the set A. Using these characterizations we deduce several properties of the lattice \mathcal E; in particular, we prove that \mathcal E is tolerance-simple whenever |A|\geq 4.
