We determine the probability P of two independent events A and B, which occur randomly n_A and n_B times during a total time T and last for t_A and t_B, to occur simultaneously at some point during T. Therefore we first prove the precise equation \begin{equation*} P^* = \dfrac{t_A+t_B}{T} - \dfrac{t_A^2+t_B^2}{2T^2} \end{equation*} for the case n_A = n_B = 1 and continue to establish a simple approximation equation \begin{equation*} P \approx 1 - \left( 1 - n_A \dfrac{t_A + t_B}{T} \right)^{n_B} \end{equation*} for any given value of n_A and n_B. Finally we prove the more complex universal equation \begin{equation*} P = 1 - \dfrac{ \left( T^+ - t_A n_A - t_B n_B \right)^{n_A + n_B} }{ \left( T^+ - t_A n_A \right)^{n_A} \left( T^+ - t_B n_B \right)^{n_B} } \pm E^\pm, \end{equation*} which yields the probability for A and B to overlap at some point for any given parameter, with T^+ := T + \frac{t_A + t_B}{2} and a small error term E^\pm.
