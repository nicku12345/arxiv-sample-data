In this paper we give a new definition of soft topology using elementary union and elementary intersection although these operations are not distributive. Also we have shown that this soft topology is different from Naz's soft topology and studied some basic properties of this new type of soft topology. Here we use elementary complement of soft sets, though law of excluded middle is not valid in general for this type of complementation.
