We introduce and study a general concept of multiple fixed point for mappings defined on partially ordered distance spaces in the presence of a contraction type condition and appropriate monotonicity properties. This notion and the obtained results complement the corresponding ones from [Choban, M., Berinde, V., {\it A general concept of multiple fixed point for mappings defined on spaces with a distance} (submitted)] and also simplifies some concepts of multiple fixed point considered by various authors in the last decade or so.
