The aim of this paper is to establish some metrical coincidence and common fixed point theorems with an arbitrary relation under an implicit contractive condition which is general enough to cover a multitude of well known contraction conditions in one go besides yielding several new ones. We also provide an example to demonstrate the generality of our results over several well known corresponding results of the existing literature. Finally, we utilize our results to prove an existence theorem for ensuring the solution of an integral equation.
