Let x\geq 1 be a large number, and let 1 \leq a <q  be integers such that \gcd(a,q)=1 and q=O(\log^c) with c>0 constant. This note proves that the counting function for the number of primes p \in \{p=qn+a: n \geq1 \} with a fixed primitive root u\ne \pm 1, v^2 has the asymptotic formula \pi_u(x,q,a)=\delta(u,q,a)x/ \log x +O(x/\log^b x), where \delta(u,q,a)>0 is the density, and b>c+1 is a constant.
