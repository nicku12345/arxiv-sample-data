In 1976, Appel and Haken \cite{ah1, ah2} achieved a major break through by thoroughly establishing the four color theorem (4CT). Their proof is based on studying a large number of cases for which a computer-assisted search for hours is required. In 1997, Robertson, Sanders, Seymour and Thomas reproved the 4CT with less need for computer verification \cite{rs}. In this paper, we give a simple proof to the 4CT based on mathematical induction and contraction. And we consider possible colorings of a minimum degree vertex, its adjacent vertices and adjacent vertices of these adjacent vertices of simple planar graphs.
