In this short note we prove that a matrix A\in\mathbb{R}^{n,n} is self-adjoint if and only if it is equivariant with respect to the action of a group \Gamma\subset {\bf O}(n) which is isomorphic to \otimes_{k=1}^n\mathbf{Z}_2. Moreover we discuss potential applications of this result, and we use it in particular for the approximation of higher order derivatives for smooth real valued functions of several variables.
