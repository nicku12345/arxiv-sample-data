For a colour cluster \C =(\mathcal{C}_1,\mathcal{C}_2, \mathcal{C}_3,\dots,\mathcal{C}_\ell), \mathcal{C}_i is a colour class, and |\mathcal{C}_i|=r_i \geq 1, we investigate a simple connected graph structure G^{\C}, which represents a graphical embodiment of the colour cluster such that the chromatic number \chi(G^{\C})= \ell, and the number of edges is a maximum, denoted \varepsilon^+(G^{\C}). We also extend the study by inducing new colour clusters recursively by blending the colours of all pairs of adjacent vertices. Recursion repeats until a maximal homogeneous blend between all \ell colours is obtained. This is called total chromatic blending. Total chromatic blending models for example, total genetic, chemical, cultural or social orderliness integration.
