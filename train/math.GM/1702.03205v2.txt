Closed form expressions are given for computing the parameters and vectors that identify and define the n-1 dimensional conic section that results from the intersection of a hyperplane with an n-dimensional conic section: cone, hyperboloid of two sheets, ellipsoid or paraboloid. The conic sections are assumed to be symmetric about their major axis, but may have any orientation and center. A class of hyperboloids are identified with the property that the parameters and vectors of the intersection of all hyperboloids in a subset of the class can be computed efficiently.
