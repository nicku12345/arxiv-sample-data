In this article, utilizing the concept of w-distance, we prove the celebrated Banach's fixed point theorem in metric spaces equipped with an arbitrary binary relation. Necessarily our findings unveil another direction of relation-theoretic metrical fixed point theory. Also, our paper consists of several non-trivial examples which signify the motivation for such investigations. Finally, our obtained results enable us to explore the existence and uniqueness of solutions of nonlinear fractional differential equations involving the Caputo fractional derivative.
