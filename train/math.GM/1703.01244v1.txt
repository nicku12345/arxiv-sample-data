This article explores the geometric algebra of Minkowski spacetime, and its relationship to the geometric algebra of Euclidean 4-space. Both of these geometric algebras are algebraically isomorphic to the 2x2 matrix algebra over Hamilton's famous quaternions, and provide a rich geometric framework for various important topics in mathematics and physics, including stereographic projection and spinors, and both spherical and hyperbolic geometry. In addition, by identifying the time-like Minkowski unit vector with the extra dimension of Euclidean 4-space, David Hestenes' Space-Time Algebra of Minkowski spacetime is unified with William Baylis' Algebra of Physical Space.
