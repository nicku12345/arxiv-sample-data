In this paper, we present a way to measure the intelligence (or the interest) of an approximation of a given real number in a given model of approximation. Basing on the idea of the complexity of a number, defined as the number of its digits, we introduce a function noted \mu (called a measure of intelligence) associating to any approximation \mathbf{app} of a given real number in a given model a positive number \mu(\mathbf{app}), which characterises the intelligence of that approximation. Precisely, the approximation \mathbf{app} is intelligent if and only if \mu(\mathbf{app}) \geq 1. We illustrate our theory by several numerical examples and also by applying it to the rational model. In such case, we show that it is coherent with the classical rational diophantine approximation. We end the paper by proposing an open problem which asks if any real number can be intelligently approximated in a given model for which it is a limit point.
