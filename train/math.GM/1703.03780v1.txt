A lacunary sequence is an increasing integer sequence \theta=(k_r) such that k_r-k_{r-1}\rightarrow \infty as r\rightarrow \infty. In this article we introduce arithmetic statistically convergent sequence space ASC and lacunary arithmetic statistically convergent sequence space ASC_{\theta} and study some inclusion properties between the two spaces. Finally we introduce lacunary arithmetic statistical continuity and establish some interesting results.
