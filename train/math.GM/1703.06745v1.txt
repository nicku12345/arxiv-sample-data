In this study, a computational method referred to as Perturbation Iteration Transform Method (PITM), which is a combination of the conventional Laplace Transform Method (LTM) and the Perturbation Iteration Algorithm (PIA) is applied for the solution of Newell-Whitehead- Segel Equations (NWSEs). Three unique examples are considered and the results obtained are compared with their exact solutions graphically. Also, the results agree with those obtained via other semi-analytical methods viz: New Iterative Method and Adomian Decomposition Method. This present method proves to be very efficient and reliable. Mathematica 10 is used for all the computations in this study.
