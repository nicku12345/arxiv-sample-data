We study the geometry of Finsler submanifolds using the pulled-back approach. We define the Finsler normal pulled-back bundle and obtain the induced geometric objects, namely, induced pullback Finsler connection, normal pullback Finsler connection, second fundamental form and shape operator. Under a certain condition, we prove that induced and intrinsic Hashiguchi connections coincide on the pulled-back bundle of Finsler submanifold.
