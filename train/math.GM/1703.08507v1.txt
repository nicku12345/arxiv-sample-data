The warped product M_1 \times_F M_2 of two Riemannian manifolds (M_1,g_1) and (M_2,g_2) is the product manifold M_1 \times M_2 equipped with the warped product metric g=g_1 + F^2 g_2, where F is a positive function on M_1. The notion of warped product manifolds is one of the most fruitful generalizations of Riemannian products. Such a notion plays very important roles in differential geometry as well as in physics, especially in general relativity. In this paper we study warped product manifolds endowed with a Tripathi connection. We establish some relationships between the Tripathi connection of the warped product M to those M_1 and M_2.
