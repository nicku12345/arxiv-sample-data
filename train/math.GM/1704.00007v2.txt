Let n be a non-null positive integer and d(n) is the number of positive divisors of n, called the divisor function. Of course, d(n) \leq n. d(n) = 1 if and only if n = 1. For n > 2 we have d(n) \geq 2 and in this paper we try to find the smallest k such that d(d(...d(n)...)) = 2 where the divisor function is applied k times. At the end of the paper we make a conjecture based on some observations.
