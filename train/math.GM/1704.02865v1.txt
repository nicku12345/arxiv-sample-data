The purpose of the paper is to construct a new representation of dual quaternions called bi-periodic dual Fibonacci quaternions. These quaternions are originated as a generalization of the known quaternions in literature such as dual Fibonacci quaternions, dual Pell quaternions and dual k-Fibonacci quaternions. Furthermore, some of them have not been introduced until this time. Then, we give generating function, Binet formula and Catalan's identity in terms of these quaternions.
