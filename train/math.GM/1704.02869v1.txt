A vertex v of a given graph is said to be in a rainbow neighbourhood of G if every colour class of G consists of at least one vertex from the closed neighbourhood N[v]. A maximal proper colouring of a graph G is a Johan colouring if and only if every vertex of G belongs to a rainbow neighbourhood of G. In general all graphs need not have a Johan colouring, even though they admit a chromatic colouring. In this paper, we characterise graphs which admit a Johan colouring. We also discuss some preliminary results in respect of certain graph operations which admit a Johan colouring under certain conditions.
