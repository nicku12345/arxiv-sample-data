The Fundamental Theorem of Integral Calculus links the integrand and its antiderivative via a simple first order differential equation. A numerical solution of this ode yields the antiderivative and hence the required integral. This approach offers an economical and accurate alternative to the conventional approaches like the Gauss and the Double Exponential (DE) quadratures as demonstrated by a variety of examples.
