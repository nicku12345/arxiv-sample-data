The concept of a \Gamma-semigroup has been introduced by Mridul Kanti Sen in the Int. Symp., New Delhi, 1981. It is well known that the Green's relations play an essential role in studying the structure of semigroups. In the present paper we deal with an application of \Gamma-semigroups techniques to the Green's Theorem in an attempt to show the way we pass from semigroups to \Gamma-semigroups.
