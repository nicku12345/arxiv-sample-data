Let {\Xi} be a function relating to the Riemann zeta function with . In this paper, we construct a function containing and {\Xi} , and prove that satisfies a nonadjoint boundary value problem to a nonsingular differential equation if is any nontrivial zero of {\Xi} . Inspecting properties of and using known results of nontrivial zeros of , we derive that nontrivial zeros of all have real part equal to , which concludes that Riemann Hypothesis is true.
