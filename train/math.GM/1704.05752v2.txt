The double exponential formula was introduced for calculating definite integrals with singular point oscillation functions and Fourier-integrals. The double exponential transformation is not only useful for numerical computations but it is also used in different methods of Sinc theory. In this paper we use double exponential transformation for calculating particular improper integrals. By improving integral estimates having singular final points. By comparison between double exponential transformations and single exponential transformations it is proved that the error margin of double exponential transformations is smaller. Finally Fourier-integral and double exponential transformations are discussed.
