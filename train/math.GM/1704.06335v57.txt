This work contains two papers: the first entitled "Euler's double equations equivalent to Fermat's Last Theorem" presents a marvellous "Eulerian" proof of Fermat's Last Theorem, which could have entered in a not very narrow margin, i.e. in only a few pages (less than 13). The second instead, entitled "The origin of the Frey elliptic curve in a too narrow margin" provides a proof, which is not elementary (25 pages): It is in various ways articulated and sometimes the author use facts with are proven later, but it is still addressed in an appropriate manner. This proof is however conditioned by presence of a right triangle (very often used by Fermat in his elusive digressions on natural numbers) or more precisely from a Pythagorean equation, which has a role decisive in the reconstruction of the lost proof. Regarding the first paper, following an analogous and almost identical approach to that of A. Wiles, I tried to translate the aforementioned bond into a possible proof of Fermat's Theorem. More precisely, through the aid of a Diophantine equation of second degree, homogeneous and ternary, solved at first not directly, but as a consequence of the resolution of the double Euler equations that originated it and finally in a direct I was able to obtain the following result: the intersection of the infinite solutions of Euler's double equations gives rise to an empty set and this only by exploiting a well known Legendre Theorem, which concerns the properties of all the Diophantine equations of the second degree, homogeneous and ternary. I report that the "Journal of Analysis and Number Theory" has made this paper in part (5 pages) available online at http://www.naturalspublishing.com/ContIss.asp?IssID=1779
