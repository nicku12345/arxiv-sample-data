In most studies related to colouring of graphs and perhaps in the study of other invariants and variants of graphs, the restrictions of non-triviality and connectedness are placed upon graphs. For the introduction to comp\^{o}nent\u{a} analysis, these restrictions are relaxed. In particular, this essay focuses on comp\^{o}nent\u{a} analysis in respect of the recently introduced J-colouring. The concept of J^c-rainbow connectivity is also introduced in this paper.
