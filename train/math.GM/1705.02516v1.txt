Calculating the value of C^{k\in\{1,\infty\}} class of smoothness real-valued function's derivative in point of \mathbb{R}^+ in radius of convergence of its Taylor polynomial (or series), applying an analog of Newton's binomial theorem and q-difference operator. (P,q)-power difference introduced in section 5. Additionally, by means of Newton's interpolation formula, the discrete analog of Taylor series, interpolation using q-difference and p,q-power difference is shown.
