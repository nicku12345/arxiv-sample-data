In this paper, we prove coincidence and common fixed points results under nonlinear contractions on a metric space equipped with an arbitrary binary relation. Our results extend, generalize, modify and unify several known results especially those are contained in Berzig [J. Fixed Point Theory Appl. 12, 221-238 (2012))] and Alam and Imdad [To appear in Filomat (arXiv:1603.09159 (2016))]. Interestingly, a corollary to one of our main results under symmetric closure of a binary relation remains a sharpened version of a theorem due to Berzig. Finally, we use examples to highlight the accomplished improvements in the results of this paper.
