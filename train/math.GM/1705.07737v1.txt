The conformal compactification is considered in a hierarchy of hypercomplex projective spaces with relevance in physics including Minkowski and Anti-de Sitter space. The geometries are expressed in terms of bicomplex Vahlen matrices and further broken down into their structural components. The relation between two subsequent projective spaces is displayed in terms of the complex unit and three additional hypercomplex numbers.
