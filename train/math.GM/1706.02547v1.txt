Colouring the vertices of a graph G according to certain conditions can be considered as a random experiment and a discrete random variable X can be defined as the number of vertices having a particular colour in the proper colouring of G. In this paper, we extend the concepts of mean and variance, two important statistical measures, to the theory of graph colouring and determine the values of these parameters for a number of standard graphs.
