In this paper, we suggest a possible series form solution to the Navier-Stokes equation and the Euler equation. With the initial velocity vector known, a series form solution for the velocity vector and pressure can be calculated. We admit that the convergence of these series still need to be proved before completely solving the existence of the Navier-Stokes equation and the Euler equation.
