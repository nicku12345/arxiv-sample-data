The paper deals with the question of homometry in the dihedral groups D_{n} of order 2n. These groups have the specificity to be non-commutative. It leads to a new approach as compared as the one used in the traditional framework of the commutative group  \mathbb{Z}_{n}. We give here a musical interpretation of homometry in D_{12} using the well-known neo-Riemannian groups, some computational results concerning enumeration of homometric sets for small values of n, and some properties disclosing important links between homometry in \mathbb{Z}_{n} and homometry in D_{n}. Finally we propose an extension of musical applications for this non-commutative homometry.
