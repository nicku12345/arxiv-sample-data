In any cubic polynomial, the average of the slopes at the 3 roots is the negation of the slope at the average of the roots. In any quartic, the average of the slopes at the 4 roots is twice the negation of the slope at the average of the roots. We generalize such situations and present a procedure for determining all such relationships for polynomials of any degree. E.g., in any septic f, letting \overline{f}_n denote the mean f value over all zeroes of the derivative f^{\left(n\right)}, it holds that 37 \overline{f}_1-150 \overline{f}_3+200\,\overline{f}_4-135\,\overline{f}_5+48\,% \overline{f}_6=0; and in any quartic it holds that 5 \overline{f}_1-6 \overline{f}_2+1\,\overline{f}_3=0. Having calculated such relationships in all dimensions up to 40, in all even dimensions there is a single relationship, in all odd dimensions there is a two-dimensional family of relationships. We come upon connections to Tchebyshev, Bernoulli, \& Euler polynomials, and Stirling numbers.
