In 1937, Lothar Collatz conjectured that the sequence generated by the rule f(n)=3n+1 for n\in\mathbb{N} odd, f(n)=n/2 for n\in\mathbb{N} even, starting in any positive integer n produces 1. This is equivalent to (1) there are no cycles except the trivial one, (1-4-2-1), and (2) there is no infinite sequence. We prove (1) using graph theory and linear algebra.
