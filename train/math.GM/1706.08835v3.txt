In this paper we present a two-term Machin-like formula for pi \[\frac{\pi}{4} = 2^{k - 1}\arctan\left(\frac{1}{u_1}\right) + \arctan\left(\frac{1}{u_2}\right)\] with small Lehmer's measure e \approx 0.245319 and describe iteration procedure for simplified determination of the required rational number u_2 at k = 27 and u_1 = 85445659. With these results we obtained a formula that has no irrational numbers involved in computation and provides 16 digits of pi at each increment by one of the summation terms. This is the smallest Lehmer's measure ever reported for the Machin-like formulas for pi.
