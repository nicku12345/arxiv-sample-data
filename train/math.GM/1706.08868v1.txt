The Riemann \Xi(z) function (even in z) admits a Fourier transform of an even kernel \Phi(t)=4e^{9t/2}\theta''(e^{2t})+6e^{5t/2}\theta'(e^{2t}). Here \theta(x):=\theta_3(0,ix) and \theta_3(0,z) is a Jacobi theta function, a modular form of weight \frac{1}{2}. (A) We discover a family of functions \{\Phi_n(t)\}_{n\geqslant 2} whose Fourier transform on compact support (-\frac{1}{2}\log n, \frac{1}{2}\log n), \{F(n,z)\}_{n\geqslant2}, converges to \Xi(z) uniformly in the critical strip S_{1/2}:=\{|\Im(z)|< \frac{1}{2}\}. (B) Based on this we then construct another family of functions \{H(14,n,z)\}_{n\geqslant 2} and show that it uniformly converges to \Xi(z) in the critical strip S_{1/2}. (C) Based on this we construct another family of functions \{W(n,z)\}_{n\geqslant 8}:=\{H(14,n,2z/\log n)\}_{n\geqslant 8} and show that if all the zeros of \{W(n,z)\}_{n\geqslant 8} in the critical strip S_{1/2} are real, then all the zeros of \{H(14,n,z)\}_{n\geqslant 8} in the critical strip S_{1/2} are real. (D) We then show that W(n,z)=U(n,z)-V(n,z) and U(n,z^{1/2}) and V(n,z^{1/2}) have only real, positive and simple zeros. And there exists a positive integer N\geqslant 8 such that for all n\geqslant N, the zeros of U(n,x^{1/2}) are strictly left-interlacing with those of V(n,x^{1/2}). Using an entire function equivalent to Hermite-Kakeya Theorem for polynomials we show that W(n\geqslant N,z^{1/2}) has only real, positive and simple zeros. Thus W(n\geqslant N,z) have only real and imple zeros. (E) Using a corollary of Hurwitz's theorem in complex analysis we prove that \Xi(z) has no zeros in S_{1/2}\setminus\mathbb{R}, i.e., S_{1/2}\setminus \mathbb{R} is a zero-free region for \Xi(z). Since all the zeros of \Xi(z) are in S_{1/2}, all the zeros of \Xi(z) are in \mathbb{R}, i.e., all the zeros of \Xi(z) are real.
