In 1970, based on newly available empiric evidence, a remarkable monotonicity property for | \zeta(z) | was conjectured by R. Spira. The \zeta-monotonicity property can be written as follows:  | \zeta (x_2 + y i ) | < | \zeta \left ( x_1 +y i \right )| \hspace{0.5cm} \textrm {for any } \hspace{0.25cm} x_1 < x_2 \leq 0.5 \textrm{ and } 6.29 <y.  In this work we present an experimental study of the monotonicity conjecture, in the course of which new properties of \zeta(z) are discovered. For instance, the spectrum of semi-limits  \lambda(z) \subset \mathbb{R} and the core function C(z), which serves as a non-chaotic simplification of \zeta(z) to the left of the critical line
