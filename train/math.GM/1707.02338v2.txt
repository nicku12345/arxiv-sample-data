Geometric number systems, obtained by extending the real number system to include new anticommuting square roots of +1 and -1, provide a royal road to higher mathematics by largely sidestepping the tedious languages of tensor analysis and category theory. The well known consistency of real and complex matrix algebras, together with Cartan-Bott periodicity, firmly establishes the consistency of these geometric number systems, often referred to as Clifford algebras. The geometrization of the real number system is the culmination of the thousands of years of human effort at developing ever more sophisticated and encompassing number systems underlying scientific progress and advanced technology in the 21st Century. Complex geometric algebras are also considered.
