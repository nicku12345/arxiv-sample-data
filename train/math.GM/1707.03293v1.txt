If \mathcal{G} is the group (under composition) of diffeomorphisms f : {\bar{D}}(0;1) \rightarrow {\bar{D}}(0;1) of the closed unit disc {\bar{D}}(0;1) which are the identity map id : {\bar{D}}(0;1) \rightarrow {\bar{D}}(0;1) on the closed unit circle and satisfy the condition det(J(f)) > 0, where J(f) is the Jacobian matrix of f or (equivalently) the Fr\'echet derivative of f, then \mathcal{G} equipped with the metric d_{\mathcal{G}}(f,g) = \Vert f-g \Vert_{\infty } + \Vert J(f) - J(g) \Vert_{\infty }, where f, g range over \mathcal{G}, is a metric space in which d_{\mathcal{G}} \left( f_{t} , id \right) \rightarrow 0 as t \rightarrow 1^{+}, where f_{t}(z) = \frac{ tz }{ 1 + (t-1) \vert z \vert }, whenever z \in {\bar{D}}(0;1) and t \geq 1.
