In the present paper, we investigate special Smarandache curves with Darboux apparatus with respect to Frenet and Darboux frame of an arbitrary curve on a surface in the three-dimensional Galilean space G3. Furthermore, we give general position vectors of special Smarandache curves of geodesic, asymptotic and curvature line on the surface in G3. As a result of this, we provide some related examples of these curves.
