Topological indices have been used to modeling biological and chemical properties of molecules in quantitive structure property relationship studies and quantitive structure activity studies. All the degree based topological indices have been defined via classical degree concept. In this paper we define a novel degree concept for a vertex of a simple connected graph: R degree. And also we define R indices of a simple connected graph by using the R degree concept. We compute the R indices for well-known simple connected graphs such as paths, stars, complete graphs and cycles
