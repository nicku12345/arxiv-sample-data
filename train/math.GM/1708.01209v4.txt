The function G(z) = \int_0^\infty \xi^{z-1}(1+\exp(\xi))^{-1} \, d\xi is analytic and has the same zeros as the Riemann zeta function in the critical strip D = \{z \in {\mathbf C} : 0 < \Re z < 1\}. This paper combines some novel methods about indefinite integration, indefinite convolutions and inversions of Fourier transforms with numerical ranges of operators to prove the Riemann hypothesis.
