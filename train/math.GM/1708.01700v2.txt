Colouring the vertices of a graph G according to certain conditions can be considered as a random experiment and a discrete random variable X can be defined as the number of vertices having a particular colour in the proper colouring of G. The concepts of mean and variance, two important statistical measures, have also been introduced to the theory of graph colouring and determined the values of these parameters for a number of standard graphs. In this paper, we discuss the colouring parameters of the Mycielskian of certain standard graphs.
