Geometric sequences are found documented as early as 300BC in the text, Book IX of Elements written by Euclid of Alexandria. In this paper a new principle for identities involving the product of any k-number of terms of a geometric sequence is presented. The results of which are independent from a specific positional term or the common ratio.
