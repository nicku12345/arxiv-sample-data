We apply symbolic method to deduce functional equation which generating function of counting sequence of dependency trees must satisfy. Then we use Lagrange inversion theorem to obtain concrete expression of the counting sequence. We apply the famous Stirling's approximation to get approximation of the counting sequence. At last, we discuss the additive parameters of dependency trees.
