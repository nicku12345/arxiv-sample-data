A vertex v of a given graph G is said to be in a rainbow neighbourhood of G, with respect to a proper coloring C of G, if the closed neighbourhood N[v] of the vertex v consists of at least one vertex from every colour class of G with respect to C. A maximal proper colouring of a graph G is a J-colouring of G if and only if every vertex of G belongs to a rainbow neighbourhood of G. In this paper, we study certain parameters related to J-colouring of certain Mycielski type graphs.
