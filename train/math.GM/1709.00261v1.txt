In this paper, a new invariant of a graph namely, the rainbow neighbourhood equate number of a graph G denoted by ren(G) is introduced. It is defined to be the minimum number of vertices whose removal results in a subgraph that admits a J-colouring. The new notions of chromatic degree of a vertex d_\chi(v), the maximum and minimum chromatic degrees of G denoted, \Delta_\chi(G) and \delta_\chi(G) respectively, are also introduced. The chromatic diameter of G denoted, d(G,\chi) is introduced as well. The study of ren(G) appears to be very complex for graphs in general so for now, only introductory results will be presented. Finally, the concept of a chromatic degree sequence is proposed as a new research direction.
