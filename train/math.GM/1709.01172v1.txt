This note presents an upper bound for the least prime primitive roots g^*(p) modulo p, a large prime. The current literature has several estimates of the least prime primitive root g^*(p) modulo a prime p\geq 2 such as g^*(p)\ll p^c, c>2.8. The estimate provided within seems to sharpen this estimate to the smaller estimate g^*(p)\ll p^{5/\log \log p} uniformly for all large primes p\geq 2.
