Currently there is no known efficient formula for primes. Besides that, prime numbers have great importance in e.g., information technology such as public-key cryptography, and their position and possible or impossible functional generation among the natural numbers is an ancient dilemma. The properties of the functions 2ab+a+b in the domain of natural numbers are introduced, analyzed, and exhibited to illustrate how these single out all the prime numbers from the full set of odd numbers. The characterization of odd primes vs. odd non-primes can be done with 2ab+a+b among the odd natural numbers as an analogue to the other, well known type of fundamental characterization for irrational and rational numbers among the real numbers. The prime number theorem, twin primes and erratic nature of primes, are also commented upon with respect to selection, as well as with the Fermat and Euler numbers as examples.
