The 3x + 1 problem concerns iteration of the map T:\mathbb{Z}\rightarrow\mathbb{Z} given by \begin{align*} T(x)=\left\{\begin{array}{lcr}\;\;\;\;\displaystyle{\frac{x}{2}} & \mbox{if \,x\equiv 0\ (mod\ 2)}, \displaystyle{\frac{3x+1}{2}} & \mbox{if \,x\equiv 1\ (mod\ 2)}.\end{array}\right. \end{align*} The 3x+1 Conjecture states that every x\geq1 has some iterate T^s(x)=1. The least s\in\mathbb{N} such that T^s(x)<x is called the stopping time of x. It is shown that the residue classes of the integers x>1 with a finite stopping time can be evolved according to a directed rooted tree based on their parity vectors. Each parity vector represents a unique Diophantine equation whose only positive solutions are the integers with a finite stopping time. The tree structure is based on a precise algorithm which allows accurate statements about the solutions x without solving the Diophantine equations explicitly. As a consequence, the integers x>1 with a finite stopping time can be generated algorithmically. It is also shown that the OEIS sequences A076227 and A100982 related to the residues (mod\ 2^k) can be generated algorithmically in a Pascal's triangle-like manner from the two starting values 0 and 1. Summarized, the results of this paper present a fully self-contained theory of the 3x+1 stopping time problem. For the results no statistical and probability theoretical methods were used.
