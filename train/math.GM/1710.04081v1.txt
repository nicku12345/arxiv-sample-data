We answer the question positively. In fact, we believe to have proved that every even integer 2N\geq3\times10^{6} is the sum of two odd distinct primes. Numerical calculations extend this result for 2N in the range 8-3\times10^{6}. So, a fortiori, it is shown that every even integer 2N>2 is the sum of two primes (Goldbach conjecture). Of course, we would be grateful for comments and objections.
