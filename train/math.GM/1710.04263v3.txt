We define a new structure on a space endowed with convexities, and call it a fractoconvex structure (or, a space with fractoconvexity). We introduce two operations on a set of fractoconvexities and in a special case we show that they satisfy the laws for a distributive lattice. We establish a connection between fractoconvex sets and convex sets using the concept of independent convexities, based on the possibility of representing a fractoconvex set as the intersection of its convex hulls. Finally, we consider some examples of fractoconvexities on the 2-sphere and on \mathbb Z.
