Consider the following process: Take any four-digit number which has at least two distinct digits. Then, rearrange the digits of the original number in ascending and descending order, take these two numbers, and find the difference between the two. Finally, repeat this routine using the difference as the new four-digit number. In 1949, D. R. Kaprekar became the first to discover that this process, known as the Kaprekar Routine, would always yield 6174 within 7 iterations. Since this number remains unchanged after an application of the Kaprekar Routine, it became known as Kaprekar's Constant. Previous works have shown that the only base 10 Kaprekar's Constants are 495 and 6174, the 3-digit and 4-digit case. However, little attention has been given to other bases or determining which digit cases and which bases have a Kaprekar's Constant. This paper analyzes the behavior of the Kaprekar Routine in the 3-digit case, deriving an expression for all 3-digit Kaprekar Constants. In addition, the author developed a series of C++ programs to analyze the paths integers followed to their respective Kaprekar's Constant. Surprisingly, it was determined from this program that the most commonly required number of iterations required to reach Kaprekar's Constant for 3-digit integers was consistently 3, regardless of base. When loaded as a matrix, the iteration requirement data demonstrates a precise recurring relationship reminiscent of Pascal's Triangle.
