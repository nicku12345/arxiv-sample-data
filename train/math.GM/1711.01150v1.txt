The purpose of the present paper is to examine the zeros of R-Bonacci polynomials and their derivatives. We confirm a conjecture about the zeros of R-Bonacci polynomials for some special cases. We also find explicit formulas of the roots of derivatives of R-Bonacci polynomials in some special cases.
