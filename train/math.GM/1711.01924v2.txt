Consider an m\times n table T and latices paths \nu_1,\ldots,\nu_k in T such that each step \nu_{i+1}-\nu_i=(1,1), (1,0) or (1,-1). The number of paths from the (1,i)-blank (resp. first column) to the (s,t)-blank is denoted by \mathcal{D}^i(s,t) (resp. \mathcal{D}(s,t)). Also, the number of all paths form the first column to the las column is denoted by \mathcal{I}_m(n). We give explicit formulas for the numbers \mathcal{D}^1(s,t) and \mathcal{D}(s,t).
