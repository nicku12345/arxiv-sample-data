In this paper we introduce the notion of universe, induced communities and cells with their corresponding spots. Using this language we formulate and prove the union close set conjecture by showing that for any finite universe \mathbb{U} and any induced community \mathcal{M}_{\mathbb{U}} there exist some spot a\in \mathbb{U} such that the density \begin{align} \mathcal{D}_{\mathcal{M}_{\mathbb{U}}}(a)\geq \frac{1}{2}.\nonumber \end{align}
