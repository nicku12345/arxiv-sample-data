The closed neighbourhood N[v] of a vertex v of a graph G, consisting of at least one vertex from all colour classes with respect to a proper colouring of G, is called a rainbow neighbourhood in G. The minimum number of vertices and the maximum number of vertices which yield rainbow neighbourhoods with respect to a chromatic colouring of G are called the minimum and maximum rainbow neighbourhood numbers, denoted by r^-_\chi(G), r^+_\chi(G) respectively. In this paper, by a colour, we mean a solid colour and by a transparent colour, we mean the fading of a solid colour. The fading numbers of a graph G, denoted by f^-(G), f^+(G) respectively, are the maximum number of vertices for which the colour may fade to transparent without a decrease in r^-_\chi(G) and r^+_\chi(G) respectively.
