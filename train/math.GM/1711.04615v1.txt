In 1982, the theory of rough sets proposed by Pawlak and in 2013, Luay concerned a rough probability by using the notion of Topology. In this paper, we study the rough probability in the stochastic approximation spaces by using set-valued mapping and obtain results on rough expectation, and rough variance.
