The eigenpair here means the twins consist of eigenvalue and its eigenvector. This paper introduces the three steps of our study on computing the maximal eigenpair. In the first two steps, we construct efficient initials for a known but dangerous algorithm, first for tridiagonal matrices and then for irreducible matrices, having nonnegative off-diagonal elements. In the third step, we present two global algorithms which are still efficient and work well for a quite large class of matrices, even complex for instance.
