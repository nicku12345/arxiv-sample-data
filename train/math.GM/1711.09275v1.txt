Our purpose in this article is first, following [14], to find the topological upper limits of projections of secant planes to C^{1} surfaces and the topological upper limits of projections of secant hyperplanes to C^{1} hypersurfaces and second to prove that every C^{2} space curve can be the solution of the principle of stationary action.
