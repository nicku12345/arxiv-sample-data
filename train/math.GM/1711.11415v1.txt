We study the elliptic curve E_a: (ax+1)y^2+(ax+1)(x-1)y+x^2-x=0, which we call the geometric normal form of an elliptic curve. We show that any elliptic curve whose j-invariant is real is isomorphic to a curve E_a in geometric normal form, and show that for a \notin \{0, -1, -9\}, the points on E_a, minus a set of 6 points, can be characterized in terms of the cevian geometry of a triangle.
