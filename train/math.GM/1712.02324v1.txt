In this paper, we present results for the rainbow neighbourhood numbers of set-graphs. It is also shown that set-graphs are perfect graphs. The intuitive colouring dilemma in respect of the rainbow neighbourhood convention is clarified as well. Finally, the new notion of the maximax independence, maximum proper colouring of a graph and a new graph parameter called the i-max number of G are introduced as a new research direction.
