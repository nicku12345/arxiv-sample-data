Mathematical modelling for population growth leads to a differential equation. In population growth model, we assume that rate increase of population is proportional to current population. That is, dx / dt = kx, x is a current population, k is proportionality constant represents growth rate. But in real situation, it is often ambiguous to determine exact amount of current population. It can be measured approximately. For instance, initially number of bacteria is approximately 20 and this approximate number can be represented using fuzzy number. Therefore, the appropriate growth or decay model is described using fuzzy concept. With this motivation, this paper presents solution of fuzzy growth and decay model. The solution is analysed using Seikkala differentiability of fuzzy-valued function.
