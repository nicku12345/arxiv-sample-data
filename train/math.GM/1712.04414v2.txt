In our recent publication we have proposed a new methodology for determination of the two-term Machin-like formula for pi with small arguments of the arctangent function of kind  \frac{\pi }{4} = {2^{k - 1}}\arctan \left( {\frac{1}{{{\beta_1}}}} \right) + \arctan \left( {\frac{1}{{{\beta_2}}}} \right),  where k and {\beta_1} are some integers and {\beta_2} is a rational number, dependent upon {\beta_1} and k. Although {1/\left|\beta_2\right|} may be significantly smaller than {1/\beta_1}, the large numbers in the numerator and denominator of \beta_2 decelerate the computation. In this work we show how this problem can be effectively resolved by the Newton--Raphson iteration method.
