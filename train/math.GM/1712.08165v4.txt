In this article, we propose a bivariate polynomial interpolation problem for matrices (BVPIPM), for real matrices of the order m\times n. In the process of solving the proposed problem, we establish the existence of a class of mn-dimensional bivariate polynomial subspaces (BVPS) in which the BVPIPM always posses a unique solution. Two formulas are presented to construct the respective polynomial maps from the space of real matrices of the order m\times n to two of the particular established BVPS, which satisfy the BVPIPM, by introducing an approach of bivariate polynomial interpolation. Further, we prove that these polynomial maps are isomorphisms. Some numerical examples are also provided to validate and show the applicability of our theoretical findings.
