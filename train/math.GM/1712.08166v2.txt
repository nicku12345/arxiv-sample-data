Let v\geq 2 be a fixed integer, and let x \geq 1 and z \geq x be large numbers. The exact asymptotic formula for the number of Wieferich primes p such that  v^{p-1} \equiv 1 \bmod p^2 in the short interval [x,x+z] is proposed in this note. The search conducted on the last 100 years have produced two primes p<x=10^{15} such that 2^{p-1} -1\equiv 0 \bmod p^2. The probabilistic and theoretical information within predicts the existence of another base v=2 prime on the interval [10^{15},10^{40}]. Furthermore, a result for the upper bound on the number of Wieferich primes is used to demontrate that the subset of nonWieferich primes has density 1.
