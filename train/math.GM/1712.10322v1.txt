The deck of a graph X, D(X), is defined as the multiset of all vertex-deleted subgraphs of X. Two graphs are said to be hypomorphic, if they have the same deck. Kelly-Ulam conjecture states that any two hypomorphic graphs on at least three vertices are isomorphic. In this paper, we first prove that for two finite simple hypomorphic graphs the number of l-paths between two arbitrary vertices are equal, where 1 \leq l \leq n - 2. As a consequence, it is proved that the Kelly-Ulam conjecture is correct over the category of all finite simple graphs.
