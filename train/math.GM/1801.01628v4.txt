In the book, I considered differential equations of order 1 over Banach D-algebra: differential equation solved with respect to the derivative; exact differential equation; linear homogeneous equation. I considered examples of differential equations in quaternion algebra. In order to study homogeneous system of linear differential equations, I considered vector space over division D-algebra, solving of linear equations over division D-algebra and the theory of eigenvalues in non commutative division D-algebra. I considered example of homogeneous system of linear differential equations in quaternion algebra, for which initial value problem has infinitely many solutions.
