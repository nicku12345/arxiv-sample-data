Let {\mathbb T}=({\bf T},\leq) and {\mathbb T}_{1}=({\bf T}_{1},\leq_{1}) be linearly ordered sets and \mathscr{X} be a topological space. The main result of the paper is the following:   If function \boldsymbol{f}(t,x):{\bf T}\times\mathscr{X}\mapsto{\bf T}_{1} is continuous in each variable ("t"and "x") separately and function \boldsymbol{f}_{x}(t)=\boldsymbol{f}(t,x) is monotonous on {\bf T} for every x\in\mathscr{X}, then \boldsymbol{f} is continuous mapping from {\bf T}\times\mathscr{X} to {\bf T}_{1}, where {\bf T} and {\bf T}_{1} are considered as topological spaces under the order topology and {\bf T}\times\mathscr{X} is considered as topological space under the Tychonoff topology on the Cartesian product of topological spaces {\bf T} and \mathscr{X}.
