In this paper, considering a wider class of simulation functions some fixed point results for multivalued mappings in \alpha-complete metric spaces have been presented. Results obtained in this paper extend and generalize some well-known fixed point results of the literature. Some examples and consequence are given to illustrate the usability of the theory.
