Generalizations of a metric space is one of the most important research areas in mathematics. In literature ,there are several generalized metric spaces. The latest generalized metric space is b_{v}(s) metric space which is introduced by Mitrovic and Radenovic in 2017. In this paper, we prove Kannan fixed point theorem and generalize Banach fixed point theorem for weakly contractive mappings in b_{v}(s) metric spaces. Our results extend and generalize some corresponding result.
