This commentary considers non-standard analysis and a recently introduced computational methodology based on the notion of \G1 (this symbol is called \emph{grossone}). The latter approach was developed with the intention to allow one to work with infinities and infinitesimals numerically in a unique computational framework and in all the situations requiring these notions. Non-standard analysis is a classical purely symbolic technique that works with ultrafilters, external and internal sets, standard and non-standard numbers, etc. In its turn, the \G1-based methodology does not use any of these notions and proposes a more physical treatment of mathematical objects separating the objects from tools used to study them. It both offers a possibility to create new numerical methods using infinities and infinitesimals in floating-point computations and allows one to study certain mathematical objects dealing with infinity more accurately than it is done traditionally. In these notes, we explain that even though both methodologies deal with infinities and infinitesimals, they are independent and represent two different philosophies of Mathematics that are not in a conflict. It is proved that texts \cite{Flunks, Gutman_Kutateladze_2008, Kutateladze_2011} asserting that the \G1-based methodology is a part of non-standard analysis unfortunately contain several logical fallacies. Their attempt to prove that the \G1-based methodology is a part of non-standard analysis is similar to trying to show that constructivism can be reduced to the traditional mathematics.
