In this paper we study some properties of Fibonacci-sum set-graphs. The aforesaid graphs are an extension of the notion of Fibonacci-sum graphs to the notion of set-graphs. The colouring of Fibonacci-sum graphs is also discussed. A number of challenging research problems are posed in the conclusion.
