We introduce a crisp metric d_M as the common limit of two different nets (\Delta_{M,\lambda}) and (\delta_{M,\lambda}) of crisp metrics induced by a fuzzy metric M and prove that the existence of each of these limits is equivalent to that of the other and it is characterized by another condition on the original fuzzy metric M. We also derive some of the properties of these approximate metrics \Delta_\lambda and \delta_\lambda. On the other hand, for a given a crisp metric d, establish that the fuzzy metric representing M_d with values in \{0,1\} and d are compatible with the same topology. Further, we prove that if a crisp metric d induces a fuzzy metric M_d, then all the approximate crisp metrics \Delta_{M,\lambda} and \delta_{M,\lambda} induced by this fuzzy metric are equal to the original metric d.
