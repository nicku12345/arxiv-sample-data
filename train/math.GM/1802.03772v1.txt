Binary representations of the trefoil and other knots of up to ten crossings in the simple cubic lattice were created. The BiEntropy of each knot was computed using a variety of binary encodings and compared against controls. This showed that binary encoded knots are highly disordered information objects. The BiEntropy of knots on the simple cubic lattice increases slightly as the number of crossings and length of encoding increases. We show that the non-alternating knots of nine and ten crossings are more disordered than the alternating knots of nine and ten crossings.
