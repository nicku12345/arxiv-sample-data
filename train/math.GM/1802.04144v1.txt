Recently Ruckle \cite{RuckleArithmeticalSummability} introduced the theory of arithmetical summability suggested by the sum  \sum_{k|m}f(k)  as  k  ranges over the divisors of m including  1  and  m . Following Ruckle \cite{RuckleArithmeticalSummability} we construct the sequence space  AS(G)  and  AC(G)  of arithmetic summable and arithmetic convergent sequences in the sense of geometric calculus and derive interesting results in the geometric field.
