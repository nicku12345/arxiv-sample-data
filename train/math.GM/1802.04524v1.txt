In this study we follow a new framework for the theory that offers us, other than traditional, a new angle to observe and investigate some relations between finite sets, F-lattice L and their elements. The theory is based on the Fuzzy Linear Spaces (FLS) S=(N,D). In this case, to operate on these spaces the necessary preliminaries, concepts and operations in lattices relative to FLS are introduced. Some definitions, such that k-fuzzy point, k-fuzzy line are given. Then we correspond these definitions to the definitions in usually linear spaces. We investigate some combinatorics properties of FLS. In some examples in the case where ILI=3*. We see some differences. In general, taking an ordered lattice Ln={0,a1,a2,...,an,1} we observe how some combinatorics formulas and properties are changed. In FLS the dimension concept is a set. We produce some general formulas by using some trivial examples. Furthermore, we generalize de Bruijn-Erd\"os Theorem in [2].
