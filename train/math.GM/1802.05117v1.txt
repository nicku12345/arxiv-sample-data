Frechet bounds of the 1-st kind for sets of events and its main properties are considered. The lemma on not more than two nonzero values of lower Frechet-bounds of the 1-st kind for a set of half-rare events is proved with the corollary on the analogous assertion for sets of events with arbitrary event-probability distributions.
