We deal with involution ordered semigroups possessing a greatest element, we introduce the concepts of *-regularity, *-intra-regularity, *-bi-ideal element and *-quasi-ideal element in this type of semigroups and, using the right and left ideal elements, we give relations between the regularity and *-regularity, between intra-regularity and *-intra-regularity. Finally, we prove that in an involution *-regular \vee e-semigroup every *-bi-ideal element can be considered as a product of a right and a left ideal element, we describe the form of the filter generated by an element of an involution *-intra-regular poe-semigroup S, showing that every \cal N-class of S has a greatest element.
