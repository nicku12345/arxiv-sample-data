The Dirichlet series of \zeta(s) was long ago proven to be divergent throughout half-plane \text{Re}(s)\le1. If also Riemann's proposition is true, that there exists an "expression" of \zeta(s) that is convergent at all s (except at s=1), then \zeta(s) is both divergent and convergent throughout half-plane \text{Re}(s)\le1 (except at s=1). This result violates all three of Aristotle's "Laws of Thought": the Law of Identity (LOI), the Law of the Excluded Middle (LEM), and the Law of Non-Contradition (LNC). In classical and intuitionistic logics, the violation of LNC also triggers the "Principle of Explosion" / \textit{Ex Contradictione Quodlibet} (ECQ). In addition, the Hankel contour used in Riemann's analytic continuation of \zeta(s) violates Cauchy's integral theorem, providing another proof of the invalidity of Riemann's \zeta(s). Riemann's \zeta(s) is one of the L-functions, which are all invalid due to analytic continuation. This result renders unsound all theorems (e.g. Modularity, Fermat's last) and conjectures (e.g. BSD, Tate, Hodge, Yang-Mills) that assume that an L-function (e.g. Riemann's \zeta(s)) is valid. We also show that the Riemann Hypothesis (RH) is not "non-trivially true" in classical logic, intuitionistic logic, or three-valued logics (3VLs) that assign a third truth-value to paradoxes (Bochvar's 3VL, Priest's LP).
