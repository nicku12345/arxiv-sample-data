Tanay and Kandemir <cite>TK</cite> introduced the topological structure of fuzzy soft sets. In 2013, Manatha and Das <cite>md</cite> defined seperation axioms on fuzzy soft topological spaces. In this paper, we generalized form of the seperation axioms.using fuzzy soft quasi-coincidence with sense of Ganguly and Saha <cite>GS</cite>. By using this notions, we also give some basic theorems of seperation axioms in classical topological spaces.
