In a recent paper, Chiney and Samanta have introduced a new definition of soft topology, using the soft elementary intersection and union. In this paper, basing at this approach, we introduce a definition of soft elementary compact set, and space. We introduce also some proprieties of the soft elementary compactness, and we prove the soft elementary version of Baire theorem.
