The curling number of a graph G is defined as the number of times an element in the degree sequence of G appears the maximum. Graph colouring is an assignment of colours, labels or weights to the vertices or edges of a graph. A colouring \mathcal{C} of colours c_1,c_2,\ldots,c_l is said to be a minimum parameter colouring if C consists of a minimum number of colours with smallest subscripts. In this paper, we study colouring version of curling number of certain graphs, with respect to their minimum parameter colourings.
