The zeros of the Riemann zeta function outside the critical strip are the so-called trivial zeros. While many zeros of the Riemann zeta function are located on the critical line \Re(s)=1/2, the non-existence of zeros in the remaining part of the critical strip \Re(s) \in \, ]0,1[ remains to be proven. The Riemann zeta functional leads to a relationship between the zeros of the Riemann zeta function on either sides of the critical line. Given s a complex number and \bar{s} its complex conjugate, if s is a zero of the Riemann zeta function in the critical strip \Re(s) \in \, ]0,1[, then we have \zeta(s) = \zeta(1-\bar{s}). As the Riemann hypothesis states that all non-trivial zeros lie on the critical line \Re(s) = 1/2, it is enough to show there are no zeros on either sides of the critical line within the critical strip \Re(s) \in \, ]0,1[, to say the Riemann hypothesis is true.
