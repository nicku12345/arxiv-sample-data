A hybrid analytical method for solving linear and nonlinear fractional partial differential equations is presented. The proposed analytical method is an elegant combination of the Natural Transform Method (NTM) and a well-known method, Homotopy Perturbation Method (HPM). In this analytical method, the fractional derivative is computed in Caputo sense and the nonlinear terms are calculated using He's polynomials. The proposed analytical method reduces the computational size, avoids round-off errors. Exact solutions of linear and nonlinear fractional partial differential equations is successfully obtained using the analytical method.
