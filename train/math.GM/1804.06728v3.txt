The method of this paper is my original creation. A new method for solving linear differential equations is proposed in this paper. The important conclusion of this paper is that arbitrary order linear ordinary differential equations with variable coefficients can be solved by the method of recursion and reduction of order under some conditions which easily be satisfied in practical applications.
