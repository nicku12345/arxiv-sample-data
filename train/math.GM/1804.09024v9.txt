We give some remarks on some manifolds K3 surfaces, Complex projective spaces, real projective space and Torus and the classification of two dimensional Riemannian surfaces, Green functions and the Stokes formula. We also, talk about traces of Sobolev spaces, the distance function, the notion of degree and a duality theorem, the variational formulation and conformal map in dimension 2, the metric on the boundary of a Lipschitz domain and polar geodesic coordinates and the Gauss-Bonnet formula and the positive mass theorem in dimension 3 and in the locally conformally flat case.
