This paper is devoted to the theory of prime numbers. In this paper we first introduce the notion of a matrix of prime numbers. Then, in order to investigate the density of prime numbers in separate rows of the matrix under consideration, we propose a number of lemmas and theorems that, together with the Dirichlet and Euler theorems, make it possible to prove the infinity of prime twins.
