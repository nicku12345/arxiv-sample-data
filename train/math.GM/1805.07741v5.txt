We consider a specific family of analytic functions g_{\alpha,T}(s), satisfying certain functional equations and approximating to linear combinations of the Riemann zeta-function and its derivatives of the form   c_0\zeta(s)+c_1\frac{\zeta'(s)}{\log T}+c_2\frac{\zeta''(s)}{(\log T)^2}+\dots+c_{K}\frac{\zeta^{(K)}(s)}{(\log T)^{K}}.   We also consider specific mollifiers of the form M(s)D(s) for these linear combinations, where M(s) is the classical mollifier, that is, a short Dirichlet polynomial for 1/\zeta(s), and the Dirichlet polynomial D(s) is also short but with large and irregular Dirichlet coefficients, and arises from substitution for w, in Runge's complex approximation polynomial for f(w)=\frac1{c_0+w}, of the Selberg approximation for   \frac{c_1}{\log T}\frac{\zeta'}{\zeta}(s)+\frac{c_2}{(\log T)^2}\frac{\zeta''}{\zeta}(s)+\dots+\frac{c_{K}}{(\log T)^{K}}\frac{\zeta^{(K)}}{\zeta}(s)   (analogous to Selberg's classical approximation for \frac{\zeta'}{\zeta}(s)).   Exploiting the functional equations previously mentioned (concerning translation of the variable s), together with the mean-square asymptotics of the Levinson-Conrey method and the Selberg approximation theory (with some additional results) we show that almost all of the zeros of the Riemann zeta-function are on the critical line.
