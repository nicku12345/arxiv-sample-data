Let p\geq 2 be a large prime, and let N\gg ( \log p)^{1+\varepsilon}. This note proves the existence of primitive roots in the short interval [M,M+N], where M \geq 2 is a fixed number, and  \varepsilon>0 is a small number. In particular, the least primitive root g(p)= O\left ((\log p)^{1+\varepsilon} \right), and the least prime primitive root g^*(p)= O\left ((\log p)^{1+\varepsilon} \right) unconditionally.
