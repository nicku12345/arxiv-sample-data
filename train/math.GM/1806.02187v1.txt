This paper deals with a new notion called fuzzy \alpha-cut and its properties. A notion called localic frame is also introduced. Algebraic structures arising out of the family of fuzzy \alpha-cuts have been investigated. It will be seen that this family forms a localic frame. Some significance and usefulness of fuzzy \alpha-cuts are discussed.
