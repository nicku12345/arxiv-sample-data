In 2010, a book published on the work of Jaques Hadamard, entitled "Introduction to Tensor Analysis and the Calculus of Moving Surfaces" by Dr. Pavel Grinfeld, proposed an extension of Hadamard's work to ultimately allow principles of tensorial invariance on surfaces to be extended to notions of time-dependent and moving surfaces. Coined "The Calculus of Moving Surfaces" (CMS), notions of Invariant Time Derivatives on Arbitrary Surface/Ambient Tensors, Surface Velocities, and time derivatives of time-dependent Volume & Surface Integrals were introduced. This paper focuses on extending concepts found within CMS to other Surface Objects, to Higher Orders, and to further uncover Tensors which are powerful at representing Commutations and Curvature present on Surfaces which are moving in Time.
