For two natural numbers 1<p_1<p_2, with \alpha = \frac{\log(p_1)}{\log(p_2)} irrational, we describe, in main Theorem \Omega and in Note 1.5, the factorization of two adjacent numbers in the multiplicatively closed subset S = \{p_1^ip_2^j\mid i,j\in \mathbb{N}\cup\{0\}\} using primary and secondary convergents of \alpha. This suggests general Question 1.2 for more than two generators which is still open.
