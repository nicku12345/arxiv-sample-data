Graph theory has successfully used to solve a wide range of problems encountered in diverse fields such as medical sciences, neural networks, control theory, transportation, clustering analysis, expert systems, image capturing, and network security. In past few years, a number of generalizations of graph theoretical concepts have developed to model the impreciseness and uncertainties in graphical network problems. A Pythagorean fuzzy set is a powerful tool for describing the vague concepts more precisely. The Pythagorean fuzzy set-based models provide more flexibility in handling the human judgment information as compared to other fuzzy models. The objective of this paper is to apply the concept of Pythagorean fuzzy sets to graph theory. This work introduces the notion of Pythagorean fuzzy graphs (PFGs) and describes a number of methods for their construction. We then define some basic operations on PFGs and prove some of their important properties. The work also discusses the notion of isomorphism between Pythagorean fuzzy graphs with a numerical example. Further, we introduce the concept of the strong Pythagorean fuzzy graph and the complete Pythagorean fuzzy graph. In addition, the paper also proves some results on self-complementary, self-weak complementary with Pythagorean fuzzy strong graphs and Pythagorean fuzzy complete graphs.
