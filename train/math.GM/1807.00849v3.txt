In the past 100 years, the research of Riemann Hypothesis meets many difficulties. Such situation may be caused by that people used to study Zeta function only regarding it as a complex function. Generally, complex functions are far more complex than real functions, and are hard to graph. So, people cannot grasp the nature of them easily. Therefore, it may be a promising way to try to correspond Zeta function to real function so that we can return to the real domain to study RH. In fact, under Laplace transform, the whole picture of Zeta function is very clear and simple, and the problem can be greatly simplified. And by Laplace transform, most integral and convolution operations can be converted into algebraic operations, which greatly simplifies calculating and analysis.
