With respect to a proper colouring of a graph G, we know that \delta(G) \leq \chi(G) \leq \Delta(G)+1. If distinct colours represent distinct technology types to be located at vertices the question arises on how to place at least one of each of k, 1\leq k < \chi(G) technology types together with the minimum adjacency between similar technology types. In an improper colouring an edge uv such that c(u)=c(v) is called a bad edge. In this paper, we introduce the notion of \delta^{(k)}-colouring which is a near proper colouring of G with exactly 1\leq k < \chi(G) distinct colours which minimizes the number of bad edges.
