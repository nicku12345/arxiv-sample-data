The strong contraction mapping, a self-mapping that the range is always a subset of the domain, admits a unique fixed-point which can be pinned down by the iteration of the mapping. We introduce a topological non-convex optimization method as an application of strong contraction mapping to achieve global minimum convergence. The strength of the approach is its robustness to local minima and initial point position.
