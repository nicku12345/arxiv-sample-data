We provide some upper bounds for the Mertens function (M(n): the cumulative sum of the M\ddot{\mathrm{o}}bius function) by an approach of statistical mechanics, in which the M\ddot{\mathrm{o}}bius function is taken as a particular state of a modified one-dimensional (1D) Ising model without the exchange interaction between the spins. Further, based on the assumptions and conclusions of the statistical mechanics, we discuss the problem that M(n) can be equivalent to the sum of an independent random sequence. It holds in the sense of equivalent probability, from which another two upper bounds for the M(n) can be inferred. Besides, if M(n) is a measured quantity, its upper bound is \sqrt{\frac{B}{\alpha} n} (B is constant) with a probability >1-\alpha (0<\alpha<1) from the view point of the energy fluctuations in the canonical ensemble.
