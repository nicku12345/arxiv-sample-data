In this work we present a simple approximation for the Voigt/comp-lex error function based on fitting with set of the exponential functions of form {\alpha _n}{\left| t \right|^n}{e^{ - {\beta _n}\left| t \right|}}, where {\alpha _n} and {\beta _n} are the expansion coefficients. The computational test reveals that the largest absolute differences for the real and imaginary parts of the complex error function are 0.037 and 0.036, respectively.
