A semantic analysis of formal systems is undertaken, wherein the duality of their symbolic definition based on the "State of Doing" and "State of Being" is brought out. We demonstrate that when these states are defined in a way that opposes each other, it leads to contradictions. This results in the incompleteness of formal systems as captured in the Godel's theorems. We then proceed to resolve the P-NP problem, which we show to be a manifestation of Godel's theorem itself. We then discuss the Zeno's paradox and relate it to the same aforementioned duality, but as pertaining to discrete and continuous spaces. We prove an important theorem regarding representations of irrational numbers in continuous space. We extend the result to touch upon the Continuum Hypothesis and present a new symbolic conceptualization of space, which can address both discrete and continuous requirements. We term this new mathematical framework as "hybrid space".
