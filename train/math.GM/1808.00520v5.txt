This paper proposes, and demonstrates the efficacy of, an elementary method for establishing a lower bound for cardinalities of selected sets of twin primes, and shows that the proof employed may be modified for selected sets of Goldbach pairs. Our sieve method is centred on the restrictive properties of intervals, specifically regarding divisibility distributions. We implicitly use the Chinese Remainder Theorem by way of the use of the midpoint in our intervals, and consider the sieve of Eratosthenes in such a way as to find a set of primes whose distribution is mirror-symmetrical about that midpoint. Bounds are established through the use of the formulae closely associated with the Prime Number theorem and the Mertens theorem. We show that the Goldbach conjecture is true if the Riemann hypothesis is true.
