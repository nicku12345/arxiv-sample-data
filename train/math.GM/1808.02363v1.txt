We construct real and complex matrices in terms of Kronecker products of a Witt basis of 2n null vectors in the geometric algebra over the real and complex numbers. In this basis, every matrix is represented by a unique sum of products of null vectors. The complex matrices provide a direct matrix representation for geometric algebras with signatures p+q <= 2n+1. Properties of irreducible representations of the symmetric group are presented in this geometric setting.
