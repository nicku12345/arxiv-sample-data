The prime counting function inequality \pi(x+y) < \pi(x)+\pi(y), which is known as Hardy-Littlewood conjecture, has been established for a variety of cases such as  \delta x \leq y \leq x, where 0< \delta \leq 1, and x \leq y\leq x \log x \log \log x as  x \to \infty. The goal in note is to extend the inequality to the new larger ranges \geq x \log^{-c}x\leq y \leq x, where c\geq 0 is a constant, unconditionally; and for \geq x^{1/2} \log^3x\leq y \leq x, conditional on a standard conjecture.
