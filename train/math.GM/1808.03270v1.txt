The main objective of the present paper is to investigate a sufficient condition for which a rectifying curve on a smooth surface remains invariant under isometry of surfaces, and also it is shown that under such an isometry the component of the position vector of a rectifying curve on a smooth surface along the normal to the surface is invariant.
