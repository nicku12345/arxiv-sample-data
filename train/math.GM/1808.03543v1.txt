In this paper, we introduce some new classes of algebras related to UP-algebras and semigroups, called a left UP-semigroup, a right UP-semigroup, a fully UP-semigroup, a left-left UP-semigroup, a right-left UP-semigroup, a left-right UP-semigroup, a right-right UP-semigroup, a fully-left UP-semigroup, a fully-right UP-semigroup, a left-fully UP-semigroup, a right-fully UP-semigroup, a fully-fully UP-semigroup, and find their examples.
