We introduce semicontinuous summation methods for series of fuzzy numbers and give Tauberian conditions under which summation of a series of fuzzy numbers via generalized Dirichlet series and via generalized factorial series implies its convergence. Besides, we define the concept of level Fourier series of fuzzy valued functions and obtain results concerning the summation of level Fourier series.
