In this article we study properties of Ramanujan's mock theta functions that can be expressed in Lerch sums. We mainly show that each Lerch sum is actually the integral of a Jacobian theta function (here we show that for \vartheta_3(t,q) and \vartheta_4(t,q)) and the \sec-function. We also prove some modular relations and evaluate the Fourier coefficients of a class of Lerch sums.
