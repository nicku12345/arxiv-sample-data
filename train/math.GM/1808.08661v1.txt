The family of Chithra graphs is a wide ranging family of graphs which includes any graph of size at least one. Chithra graphs serve as a graph theoretical model for genetic engineering techniques or for modelling natural mutation within various biological networks found in living systems. In this paper, we discuss recently introduced J-colouring of the family of Chithra graphs.
