The results for the fractional sequence \left \{[x/n]+1:n \leq x\right \}, and the fractional sequence in arithmetic progression \left \{q[x/n]+a:n \leq x\right \}, where a<q are integers such that \gcd(a,q)=1, prove that these sequences of fractional numbers contain the set of primes, and the set primes in arithmetic progressions as x \to \infty respectively. Furthermore, the corresponding error terms for these sequences are improved. Other results considered are the fractional sequences of integers such as the sequence \left \{[x/n]^2+1:n \leq x\right \} generated by the quadratic polynomial n^2+1, and the sequence \left \{[x/n]^3+2:n \leq x\right \} generated by the cubic polynomial n^3+2. It is shown that each of these sequences of fractional numbers contains infinitely many primes as x \to \infty.
