An efficient procedure for the computation of Li_{s}(z) where s<0 is here presented. We started with Polylogarithm Li_{s}(z) where s<0. The summation of n^{s}z^{n} is evaluated using a new method. An assumption is made that the power n is multiplied by x where x=1; then the series is integrated s time in order to cancel the term n^s out leaving the term z^n. By simply taking the derivative of the result s-times, an expression to evaluate the series arises which include only a constant term and the s^{th} order of derivative of the summation of a simple geometric series. The computation of Li_{s}(z) can then be performed in \mathcal{O}(n) operations.
