The aim of this research is to apply a novel technique based on the embedding method to solve the n*n fuzzy system of linear equations (FSLEs). By using this method, the strong fuzzy number solutions of FSLEs can be obtained by transforming the n*n FSLE to the crisp system. In this paper, Ezzati's method to solve the FSLEs is modified and improved. Several theorems are proved to show the number of operations for presented method are less than the methods of Friedman and Ezzati. In order to show the advantages of scheme, two applicable algorithms are presented and several examples are solved by applying them. Also, some graphs of obtained results are demonstrated which show the solutions are in the fuzzy form.
