Grassmannians are of fundamental importance in projective geometry, algebraic geometry, and representation theory. A vast literature has grown up utilizing using many different languages of higher mathematics, such as multilinear and tensor algebra, matroid theory, and Lie groups and Lie algebras. Here we explore the basic idea of the Plucker relations in Clifford's geometric algebra. We discover that the Plucker Relations can be fully characterized in terms of the geometric product, without the need for a confusing hodgepodge of many different formalisms and mathematical traditions found in the literature.
