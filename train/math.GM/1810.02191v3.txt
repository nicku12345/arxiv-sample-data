The Legendre conjecture has resisted analysis over a century, even under assumption of the Riemann Hypothesis. We present, a significant improvement on previous results by greatly reducing the assumption to a more modest statement called the Parity conjecture. Let p_n and p_{n+1} be two consecutive odd primes, let m be their midpoint fixed once for all. Conjecture: The largest multiple of p_n not exceeding {m_i}^2 is odd for every integer m_i in the interval (p_n, m]. Main result: We prove that the Parity conjecture implies Legendre's conjecture and Andrica's conjecture.
