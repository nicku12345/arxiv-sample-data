We found, by Hurwitz's Zeta Function, a new functional equation for Riemann Zeta Function. Considering this equation for s=2 and s=1, we determine a relation between the values of Riemann zeta Function on positive integers. The Matrix has two dimensions, and the second member is the vector (1, -\zeta(2)). The elements of this vector are linearly independent on the Rationals; and from this independence, we determined that \zeta(j) is irrational for each j=3,4,5,6,7,8,9,....
