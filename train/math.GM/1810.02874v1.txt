A great part of the mathematical foundations of topological quantum computation is given by the theory of modular categories which provides a description of the topological phases of matter such as anyon systems. In the near future the anyonic engineering will provide the anyonic devices from which the topological quantum computers will be constructed. From other side the string anyons are interesting topological phases of matter which can be described using mathematical constructions such as Frobenius algebras and open-closed string topological quantum field theories which are based on cobordism categories. Recently was proposed that is possible to obtain representations of cobordism categories using modular categories. In the present work, the modular categories resulting as representations of the 3 dimensional bordism 2 category are used with the aim to construct a new model of topological quantum computation. Such new model is named Sanyon Topological Quantum Computation and it is is theoretically performed by evolving non abelian string anyons (sanyons) using the Loop Braid Group and the open closed cobordism category. The output of the computation uniquely depends on how the sanyons have been braided by the Loop Braid Group and operated by the generators of the cobordism category. Small disturbances do not unravel the loop braids and the cobordisms, making the computation resistant to errors and decoherence.
