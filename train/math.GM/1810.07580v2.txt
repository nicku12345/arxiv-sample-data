In these notes we introduce the Clifford algebra of a quadratic space using techniques from universal algebra and algebraic theory of quadratic forms. We also define the Clifford, Pin and Spin groups associated to the algebra, and study how they relate to the isommetry group of the original quadratic space. Lastly we introduce the algebraic spinors space as a minimal left ideal (equivalently an irreducible representation) over the Clifford algebra, and mention its application in physics.
