A topological index of a graph G is a real number which is preserved under isomorphism. Extensive studies on certain polynomials related to these topological indices have also been done recently. In a similar way, chromatic versions of certain topological indices and the related polynomials have also been discussed in the recent literature. In this paper, the chromatic version of the Schultz polynomial is introduced and determined this polynomial for certain fundamental graph classes.
