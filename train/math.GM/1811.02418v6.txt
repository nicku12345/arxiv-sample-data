In this article we address the real part of the nontrivial zeros for the Riemann zeta-function by using the new infinite product formulas for the Riemann \Xi-function under the latent conditions for the existences of the symmetric real zeros that its Tur\'{a}n inequalities for the Jensen-Edwards coefficients are always valid. The equivalent theorems for a class of the Riemann zeta-functions are discussed in detail. Some new infinite product formulas for the Riemann zeta-function are proposed to show that the Riemann conjecture is true. The infinite product representations for the Dirichlet's series are also obtained based on the theory of the Riemann zeta-function.
