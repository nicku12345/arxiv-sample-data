In this paper, metallic structure and almost quadratic metric phi-structure are studied. Based on metallic (polynomial) Riemannian manifold, Kenmotsu quadratic metric manifold, cosymplectic quadratic metric manifold are defined and gave some examples. Finally, we construct quadratic phi-structure on the hypersurface M^n of a locally metallic Riemannian manifold M^n+1.
