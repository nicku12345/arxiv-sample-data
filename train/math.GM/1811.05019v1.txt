Our aim in this paper is to investigate some types of lightlike submanifolds in metallic semi-Riemannian manifolds. We study invariant and screen semi-invariant lightlike submanifolds of metallic semi-Riemannian manifolds and give examples. We obtain the conditions for the induced connection to be a metric connection. Also, we find necessary and sufficient conditions for the distributions involved in the definitions of such submanifolds to be integrable.
