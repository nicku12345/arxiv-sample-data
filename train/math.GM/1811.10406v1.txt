We generalize the notion of metallic structure in the pseudo-Riemannian setting, define the metallic Norden structure and study its integrability. We construct a metallic natural connection recovering as particular case the Ganchev and Mihova connection, which we extend to a metallic natural connection on the generalized tangent bundle. Moreover, we construct metallic pseudo-Riemannian structures on the tangent and cotangent bundles.
