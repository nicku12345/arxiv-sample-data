In this article we calculate the length of the golden spiral, and we study the golden rectangles. We calculate some measures of interest. We also show that the only rectangles that can be subdivided or that generate sub rectangles indefinitely are the golden rectangles. We emphasize that when subdividing a rectangle into sub rectangles, the Fibonacci sequence naturally appears. In addition, we identify the rectangles that resemble the golden rectangles.
