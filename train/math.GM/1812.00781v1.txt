In this paper, hyperbolic k-Fibonacci quaternions are defined. Also, some algebraic properties of hyperbolic k-Fibonacci quaternions which are connected with hyperbolic numbers and k-Fibonacci numbers are investigated. Furthermore, D'Ocagne's identity, the Honsberger identity, Binet's formula, Cassini's identity and Catalan's identity for these quaternions are given.
