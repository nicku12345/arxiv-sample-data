This paper proposes a new generalized Seikkala derivative (gS-derivative) of a fuzzy-valued function. We see that, there are many elementary fuzzy-valued functions which occur frequently as solution of fuzzy differential equation, are not Seikkala differentiable but they are generalized Seikkala differentiable. We discuss some of the properties of proposed differentiability. Using gS-differentiability, we find the solution of fuzzy initial value problem.
