In this paper, we give the definition of the natural mate of a non-null Frenet curve in Minkowski 3-spaces. The main purpose of this paper is to prove some relationships between a non-null Frenet curve and its natural mate. In particular, we obtain some necessary and suffcient conditions for the natural mate of a non-null Frenet curve to be a slant helix, a spherical curve, or a curve of constant curvature. Several applications of our main results are also presented.
