We propose a method to obtain iterative schemes guarantee unique solutions for systems of partial differential equations that are not symmetric with respect to the time by generalizing He variational iteration method and using Banach fixed point theorem. Then, iterative schemes for systems of incompressible fluid flow and incompressible micropolar fluid flow will be created by applying the generalized He variational iteration method.
