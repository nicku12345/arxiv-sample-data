A tutorial introduction to projective geometric algebra (PGA), a modern, coordinate-free framework for doing euclidean geometry. PGA features: uniform representation of points, lines, and planes; robust, parallel-safe join and meet operations; compact, polymorphic syntax for euclidean formulas and constructions; a single intuitive sandwich form for isometries; native support for automatic differentiation; and tight integration of kinematics and rigid body mechanics. Inclusion of vector, quaternion, dual quaternion, and exterior algebras as sub-algebras simplifies the learning curve and transition path for experienced practitioners. On the practical side, it can be efficiently implemented, while its rich syntax enhances programming productivity. The basic ideas are introduced in the 2D context; the 3D treatment focus on selected topics. Advantages to traditional approaches are collected in a table at the end. The article aims to be a self-contained introduction for practitioners of euclidean geometry and includes numerous examples, figures, and tables.
