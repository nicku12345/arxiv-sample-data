In this paper, by taking into account the beginning of the hypersurface theory in Euclidean space E^4, a practical method for the matrix of the Weingarten map (or the shape operator) of an oriented hypersurface M^3 in E^4 is obtained. By taking this efficient method, it is possible to study of the hypersurface theory in E^4 which is analog the surface theory in E^3. Furthermore, the Gaussian curvature, mean curvature, fundamental forms and Dupin indicatrix of M^3 is introduced.
