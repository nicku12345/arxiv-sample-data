We derive an identity connecting any two second-order linear recurrence sequences having the same recurrence relation but whose initial terms may be different. Binomial and ordinary summation identities arising from the identity are developed. Illustrative examples are drawn from Fibonacci, Fibonacci-Lucas, Pell, Pell-Lucas, Jacobsthal and Jacobsthal-Lucas sequences and their generalizations. Our new results subsume previously known identities.
