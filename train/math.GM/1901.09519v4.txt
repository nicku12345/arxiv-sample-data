In this article, we derive a Euler prime product formula for the magnitude of the Riemann zeta function \zeta(s) valid for \Re(s)>1, as well as similar formulas for \zeta(s) valid for an even and odd kth positive integer argument. We shall further give a set of generated formulas for \zeta(k) up to 11th order, including Ap\'ery's constant, and also construct formulas for \zeta(3/2). We'll also validate these formulas numerically.
