Associate a unique numerical sequence called the modular signature with each positive integer, using modular residues of each integer under the prime numbers, and distinguishing between the core seed primes and non-core seed primes used to create the modular signatures. Group the modular signatures within primorials. Use elementary sieve properties and combinatorial principles to prove the twin primes and Goldbach conjectures.
