We draw attention to a manuscript submitted to the HAL Open Archives by Francis Bessi\`ere, where he tries to base mathematics on a translative theory that could be shown consistant using only finitist methods, thus bypassing the impossibility shown by G\"odel for deductive theories, such as [ZF], for example.
