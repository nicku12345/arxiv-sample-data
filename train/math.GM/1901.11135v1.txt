In this paper, we study some graph theoretical properties of two derivative Euler Phi function set-graphs. For the Euler Phi function \phi(n), n\in \mathbb{N}, the set S_\phi(n) =\{i:\gcd(i,n)=1, 1\leq i \leq n\} and the vertex set is \{v_i:i\in S_\phi(n)\}. Two graphs G_d(S_\phi(n)) and G_p(S_\phi(n)), defined with respect to divisibility adjacency and relatively prime adjacency conditions, are studied.
