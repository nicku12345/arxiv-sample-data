Taylor series is a useful mathematical tool when describing and constructing a function. With the series representation, some properties of fractional calculus can be revealed clearly. This paper investigates two typical applications: Lebiniz rule and Laplace transform. It is analytically shown that the commonly used Leibniz rule cannot be applied for Caputo derivative. Similarly, the well-known Laplace transform of Riemann-Liouville derivative is doubtful for n-th continuously differentiable function. By the aid of this series representation, the exact formula of Caputo Leibniz rule and the explanation of Riemann-Liouville Laplace transform are presented. Finally, three illustrative examples are revisited to confirm the obtained results.
