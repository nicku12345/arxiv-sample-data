We study a new type of sequences whose elements are defined in terms of the position, sign and magnitude of another element of the sequence. The name ultra-recursive comes from the fact that these sequences possess terms that are generated adding either the previous (as in traditional recurrences formulas) or the next terms. They are also self-referential because the rules to generate every member alludes to some value of the sequence.
