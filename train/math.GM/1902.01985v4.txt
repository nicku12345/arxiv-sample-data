The present article examines the Lie group invariants of the Navier-Stokes equation (NSE) for incompressible fluids. This is accomplished by applying the invariant theory of Charles Bouton which shows that the self-similar solutions of the NSE are relative invariants of the scaling group. The scaling transformation admitted by the NSE has been recently revisited and a general form of the transformation has been discovered from which it follows that Leray's self-similar solutions are an isolated case. The general form of such solutions is derived by the application of Bouton's first theorem and shows that the standard NSE system is not always supercritical, but can be critical or subcritical. Criticality criteria are derived. Using the criterion of Beale-Kato-Majda, we rule out blow-up for a subset of Bouton's self-similar solutions. For another subset, we show that the system exhibits a conserved quantity, the cavitation number of the fluid. It is coercive, scale- and rotationally invariant. By extending the analysis of Bouton to higher-dimensioned manifolds and by virtue of Bouton's theorems, additional conserved quantities are found, which could further elucidate the physics of fluid turbulence.
