We consider translation surfaces in the 3-dimensional Euclidean space which are of coordinate finite type with respect to the third fundamental form III, i.e. their position vector x satisfies the relation \Delta^{III}x = \Lambda x, where \Lambda is a square matrix of order 3. We show that Sherk's minimal surface is the only translation surface satisfying \Delta^{III}x = \Lambda x.
