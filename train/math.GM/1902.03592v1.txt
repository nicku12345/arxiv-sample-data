While solving problems, if direct methods does not provide solution, indirect methods are explored. Today, we need an indirect method to solve the problem of angle trisection as the direct methods have been proved not to provide solutions. The unstoppable curiosity of Geometers and the newer advanced tools available with time have led to newer approaches to progress further. Results of exploration strictly following the Platonian rules of Euclidean geometry that could help in arriving at the solution is presented here.
