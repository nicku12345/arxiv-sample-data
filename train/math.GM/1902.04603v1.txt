In the world of mathematical analysis, many counterintuitive answers arise from the manipulation of seemingly unrelated concepts, ideas, or functions. For example, Euler showed that e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0, whereas Gauss proved that the area underneath y = e^{-x^2} spanning the whole real axis is  \sqrt{\pi} . In this paper, we will determine the closed-form solution of the improper integral \[ I_n = \int_{0}^{\infty} \frac{\ln{x}}{x^n+1} dx, \ \forall n \in \mathbb{R} \text{, with}\ n > 1. \] Determining closed-form solutions of improper integrals have real implications not only in easing the solving of similar, yet more difficult integrals, but also in speeding up numerical approximations of the answer by making them more efficient. Following our calculations, we derived the formula \[ I_n = \int_{0}^{\infty} \frac{\ln{x}}{x^n+1} dx = -\frac{\pi^2}{n^2}\cot{\frac{\pi}{n}}\csc{\frac{\pi}{n}} = -\frac{d}{dn} \Bigg[ \Gamma\Big(1-\frac{1}{n}\Big) \Gamma\Big(\frac{1}{n}\Big) \Bigg]. \]
