Some Hermite-Hadamard's mid-point type inequalities related to Katugampola fractional integrals are obtained where the first derivative of considered mappings is Lipschitzian or convex. Also some mid-point type inequalities are given for Lipschitzian mappings, with the aim of generalizing the results presented in previous works. Finally as an application, some generalized inequalities in connection with special means are provided.
