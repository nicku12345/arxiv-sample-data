In this paper, we consider surfaces in the 3-dimensional Euclidean space E3 which are of finite III-type, that is, they are of finite type, in the sense of B.-Y. Chen, corresponding to the third fundamental form. We present an important family of surfaces, namely, tubes in E3 .We show that tubes are of infinite III-type.
