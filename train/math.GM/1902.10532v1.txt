Statistical distribution of the primes in an arithmetic progression is considered. The estimation of prime numbers is given and combinatorial methods are used to calculate the twin primes on the available interval. The distribution and estimation of the number of primes on the twin primes rows are obtained. A new method of twin prime infinity is proposed.
