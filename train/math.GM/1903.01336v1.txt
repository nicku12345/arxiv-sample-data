In this paper, we introduce and investigate the subclass \mathcal{P}_{p,q}^{\xi ,\kappa}(\tau, \eta) of starlike functions with negative coefficients by using the differential operator \Upsilon_{\tau ,p,q}^{\xi ,\kappa}. Coefficient inequalities, growth and distortion theorems, closure theorems, and some properties of several functions belonging to this class are obtained. We also determine the radii of close-to-convexity, starlikeness, and convexity for functions belonging to the class \mathcal{P}_{p,q}^{\xi ,\kappa}(\tau, \eta). Furthermore, we obtain the integral means inequality and neighborhood results for functions belonging to the class \mathcal{P}_{p,q}^{\xi ,\kappa}(\tau, \eta). The results presented in this paper generalize or improve those in related works of several earlier authors.
