In this paper proof of the twin prime conjecture is going to be presented. Originally very difficult problem (in observational space) has been transformed into a sampler one (in generative space) that can be solved. It will be shown that twin primes could be obtained through two stage sieve process, and that will be used to obtain a reasonable estimation of the number of twin primes. The same approach is used to prove the Polignac's conjecture for cousin primes.
