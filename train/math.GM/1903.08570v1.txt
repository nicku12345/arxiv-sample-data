It is known that prime numbers occupy specific geometrical patterns or moduli when numbers from one to infinity are distributed around polygons having sides that are integer multiple of number 6. In this paper, we will show that not only prime numbers occupy these moduli, but non-prime numbers sharing these same moduli have unique prime-ness properties. When utilizing digital root methodologies, these non-prime numbers provide a novel method to accurately identify prime numbers and prime factors without trial division or probabilistic-based methods. We will also show that the icositetragon (24-sided regular polygon) is a unique polygon pertaining to prime numbers and their ultimate incidence and distribution.
