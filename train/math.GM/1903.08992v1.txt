We consider slant normal magnetic curves in (2n+1)-dimensional S-manifolds. We prove that \gamma  is a slant normal magnetic curve in an % S -manifold (M^{2m+s},\varphi ,\xi _{\alpha },\eta ^{\alpha },g) if and only if it belongs to a list of slant \varphi -curves satisfying some special curvature equations. This list consists of some specific geodesics, slant circles, Legendre and slant helices of order 3. We construct slant normal magnetic curves in \mathbb{R}^{2n+s}(-3s) and give the parametric equations of these curves.
