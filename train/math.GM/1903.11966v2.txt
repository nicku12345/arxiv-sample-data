We investigate the 2D quaternion windowed linear canonical transform(QWLCT) in this paper. Firstly, we propose the new definition of the QWLCT, and then several important properties of newly defined QWLCT, such as bounded, shift, modulation, orthogonality relation, are derived based on the spectral representation of the quaternionic linear canonical transform(QLCT). Finally, by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle for the QLCT and the orthogonality relation property for the QWLCT, the Heisenberg uncertainty principle for the QWLCT is established.
