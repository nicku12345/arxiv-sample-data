Fractional calculus is a powerful and effective tool for modelling nonlinear systems. The M derivative is the generalization of alternative fractional derivative. This M derivative obey the properties of integer calculus. In this paper, we present the method for solving M fractional sequential linear differential equations with constant coefficients for alpha is greater than or equal to 0 and beta is greater than 0. Existence and Uniqueness of the solutions for the nth order sequential linear M fractional differential equations are discussed in detail. We have present illustration for homogeneous and non homogeneous case.
