The manuscripts tabulates arc lists of the 1, 1, 3, 8, 25, 85, 397 ... unlabeled 2-regular digraphs on n=0, 1, 2, ..., 9 nodes, including disconnected graphs, graphs with multiarcs and/or graphs with loops. Each of these graphs represents one term of the Lagrangian of Lovelock's type -- a contraction of a product of n Riemann tensors -- once the 2 covariant and 2 contravariant indices of a tensor are associated with the in-edges and out-edges of a node.
