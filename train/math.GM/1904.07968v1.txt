Mathematics is one of the ways our species makes sense of this world and I believe that it is inherent in our thinking machinery. The mathematics we do in turn is dependent on the way we view our universe and ourselves. Lakoff and Nunez [17] argue carefully and eloquently for a mathematics inherently based on human cognition. In this note I attempt to engage with the construct of mathematical cognition through the lens of humanistic mathematics.
