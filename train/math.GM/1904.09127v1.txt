This paper reveals a novel numerical method, the sequential test, which approves chaos through sequences of numbers observations. The method alights alongside the Lyapunov exponent and bifurcation diagram test. Explicitly elucidation of the method application for both continuous and discrete systemswas given affiliated with the corresponding algorithms. The theoretical results are exemplified on systems satisfying different types of definitions of chaos or numerical methods. The results are supplemented with illustrative graphics.
