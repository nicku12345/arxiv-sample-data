In this paper the convolution integrals \int_0^t(t-s)^{\lambda -1}b(s)ds with hyper-singular kernels are considered, where \lambda\le 0 and b is a smooth or b is in L^1(\mathbb{R}_+). For such \lambda these integrals diverge classically even for smooth b. These convolution integrals are defined in this paper for \lambda\le 0, \lambda\neq 0,-1,-2,.... Integral equations and inequalities are considered with the hyper-singular kernels (t-s)^{\lambda -1}_+ for \lambda\le 0, where t^\lambda_+:=0 for t<0. In particular, one is interested in the value \lambda=-\frac 14 because it is important for the Navier-Stokes problem (NSP). Integral equations of the type b(t)=b_0(t)+ \int_0^t(t-s)^{\lambda-1}b(s)ds, \lambda\le 0, are studied. The solution of these equations is investigated, existence and uniqueness of the solution is proved for \lambda=-\frac 1 4. This special value of \lambda is of basic importance for a study of the Navier-Stokes problem (NSP). The above results are applied to the analysis of the NSP in the space \mathbb{R}^3 without boundaries. It is proved that the NSP is contradictory in the following sense: even if one assumes that the initial data v_0(x):=v(x,0)\not\equiv 0, \nabla \cdot v_0(x)=0 one proves that the solution v(x,t) to the NSP has the property v(x,0)=0. This paradox shows that the NSP is not a correct description of the fluid mechanics problem and it proves that the NSP does not have a solution.
