Let p_1, p_2, \ldots denote the prime numbers 2, 3, \ldots numbered in increasing order. The following method is used to generate primes. Start with p_1 = 2, p_2 = 3, IpP_1 = [2, 3], pP_1 = \{2, 3\}, MIpP_1 = 3 = MpP_1, \#pP_1 = 2 and for j = 1, 2, \ldots, MIpP_{j} = max IpP_{j}, MpP_{j} = max pP_{j}, \#pP_j = |pP_j|, IpP_{j+1} = [MIpP_{j}+1, MpP_j^2 +4MpP_j+3] and pP_{j+1} = \Phi(IpP_{j+1}) = the set of all primes in IpP_{j+1} = \Phi([MIpP_{j}+1, MpP_j^2+4MpP_j+2]). We use elementary method to obtain pP_{j+1}, j = 1,2,\ldots. This algorithm generates primes in a faster way to any given limit and the width of interval IpP_{j+1} is a tight bound, in general, in the sense that if we increase further, then the algorithm fails. Also, we restate the Twin prime conjecture in an easier way.
