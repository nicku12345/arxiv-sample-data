In this paper, we study quadric surfaces in the 3-dimensional Euclidean space whose Gauss map n is of coordinate finite I-type, i.e., the position vector n satisfies the relation {\Delta}In = {\Lambda}n, where {\Delta}I is the Laplace operator with respect to the first fundamental form I of the surface and {\Lambda} is a square matrix of order 3. We show that helicoids and spheres are the only quadric surfaces of coordinate finite I-type Gauss map.
