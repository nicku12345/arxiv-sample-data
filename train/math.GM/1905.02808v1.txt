Elementary transformations of equations A\psi=\lambda\psi are considered. The invertibility condition (Theorem 1) is established and similar transformations of Riccati equations in the case of second order differential operator A are constructed (Theorem 2). Applications to continuous fractions for Bessel functions and Chebyshev polynomials are established. It is shown particularly that the elementary solutions of Bessel equations are related to a fixed point transformations of Riccati equations.
