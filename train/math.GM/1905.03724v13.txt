We consider a method for the approximation of iterated stochastic Ito integrals of arbitrary multiplicity k (k\in \mathbb{N}) with respect to the infinite-dimensional Wiener process using the mean-square approximation method of iterated stochastic Ito integrals with respect to the finite-dimensional Wiener process based on generalized multiple Fourier series. The case of Fourier-Legendre series is considered in details. The results of the article can be applied to construction of high-order strong numerical methods (with respect to the temporal discretization) for a mild solution of non-commutative semilinear stochastic partial differential equations.
