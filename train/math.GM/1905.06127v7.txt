The introduction of strings into the study of the Riemann Hypothesis provides a visualization of the genesis of zeros for the Zeta function. The method is heuristic and when originally introduced suggested strong visual evidence for the truth of the Riemann Hypothesis. Some sort of organizing principle for strings with similar t values is observed and points towards a region between (1, 0) and (0, 0) on the abscissa, and within order unity along the ordinate. Progress in understanding these observations has been made by expanding the domain of sigma from the critical strip, [0, 1], to the half-line [0, infinity]. The nature of the organizing principle is explained. A generic structure for strings over the expanded domain is proffered. New perspective is gained regarding the truth of the Riemann Hypothesis.
