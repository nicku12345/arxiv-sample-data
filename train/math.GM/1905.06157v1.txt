The fundamental purpose of this paper is to propose a new Laplace-type integral transform (NL-TIT) for solving steady heat-transfer problems. The proposed integral transform is a generalization of the Sumudu, and the Laplace transforms and its visualization is more comfortable than the Sumudu transform, the natural transform, and the Elzaki transform. The suggested integral transform is used to solve the steady heat-transfer problems, and results are compared with the results of the existing techniques.
