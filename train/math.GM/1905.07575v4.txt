Andrei et al. have shown in 2000 that the graph \boldsymbol{\mathrm{C}} of the Collatz function starting with root 8 after the initial loop is an infinite binary tree \boldsymbol{A}(8). According to their result they gave a reformulated version of the Collatz conjecture: the vertex set V(\boldsymbol{A}(8))=\mathbb{Z}^+.   In this paper an inverse Collatz function \overrightarrow{C} with eliminated initial loop is used as generating function of a Collatz graph {\boldsymbol{\mathrm{C}}}_{\overrightarrow{C}}. This graph can be considered as the union of one forest that stems from sequences of powers of 2 with odd start values and a second forest that is based on branch values y=6k+4 where two Collatz sequences meet. A proof that the graph {\boldsymbol{\mathrm{C}}}_{\overrightarrow{C}}(1) is an infinite binary tree \boldsymbol{A}_{\overrightarrow{C}} with vertex set V({\boldsymbol{A}}_{\overrightarrow{C}}(1))=\mathbb{Z}^+ completes the paper.
