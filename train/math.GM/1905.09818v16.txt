This paper discusses a few main topics in Number Theory, such as the M\"{o}bius function and its generalization, leading up to the derivation of neat power series for the prime counting function, \pi(x), and the prime-power counting function, J(x). Among its main findings, we can cite the extremely useful inversion formula for Dirichlet series (given F_a(s), we know a(n), which implies the Riemann hypothesis, and enabled the creation of a formula for \pi(x) in the first place), and the realization that sums of divisors and the M\"{o}bius function are particular cases of a more general concept. From this result, one concludes that it's not necessary to resort to the zeros of the analytic continuation of the zeta function to obtain \pi(x).
