A novel kind of self-referential square matrix is introduced. A certain subset of the matrix entries record the frequencies of occurrence of each distinct number appearing within the entire matrix. Such squares are necessarily elusive. Our investigation brings to light interesting cases, such as 'generic' squares that include algebraic variables and self-descriptive squares that are also magic squares.
