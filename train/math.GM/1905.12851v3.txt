In this work we show how to perform a rapid computation of the Voigt/complex error over a single domain by vectorized interpolation. This approach enables us to cover the entire set of the parameters x,y \in \mathbb{R} required for the HITRAN-based spectroscopic applications. The computational test reveals that within domains x\in\left[0,15\right]\cap y\in\left[10^{-8},15\right] and x\in\left[0,50000\right]\cap y\geq 10^{-8} our algorithmic implementation is faster in computation by factors of about 8 and 3, respectively, as compared to the fastest known C/C++ code for the Voigt/complex error function. A rapid MATLAB code is presented.
