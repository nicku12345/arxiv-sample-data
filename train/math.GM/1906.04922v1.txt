In this paper we study biconservative immersions into the semi-Riemannian space form R^4_2(c) of dimension 4, index 2 and constant curvature, where c\in\{0,-1,1\}. First, we obtain a characterization of quasi-minimal proper biconservative immersions into R^4_2(c). Then we obtain the complete classification of quasi-minimal biconservative surfaces in R^4_2(0)=\mathbb E^4_2. We also obtain a new class of biharmonic quasi-minimal isometric immersion into \mathbb E^4_2.
