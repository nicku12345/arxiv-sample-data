In this paper implication-based intuitionistic fuzzy finite state machine otherwise called as Implication-based intuitionistic fuzzy semiautomaton (IB-IFSA) over a finite group is defined and investigated intensively. The abstraction of implication-based intuitionistic fuzzy kernel and implication-based intuitionistic fuzzy subsemiautomaton of an IB-IFSA over a finite group are brought about using the notion of implication-based intuitionistic fuzzy subgroup and implication-based intuitionistic fuzzy normal subgroup. The necessary and sufficient condition for an implication-based intuitionistic fuzzy normal subgroup to be an implication-based intuitionistic fuzzy kernel as well as the necessary and sufficient condition for an implication-based intuitionistic fuzzy subgroup} to be an implication-based intuitionistic fuzzy subsemiautomaton of an IB-IFSA are studied.
