A 4-regular matchstick graph is a planar unit-distance graph whose vertices have all degree 4. Examples of 4-regular matchstick graphs are currently known for all number of vertices \geq 52 except for 53, 55, 56, 58, 59, 61, and 62. In this article we present 38 different examples with 50 - 62 vertices which contain two, three, or four distances which differ slightly from the unit length. These graphs should show why this subject is so extraordinarily difficult to deal with and should also be an incentive for the interested reader to find solutions for the missing numbers of vertices.
