Finding theta function (or q-)analogues for well-known trigonometric identities is an interesting topic. In this paper, we first introduce the definition of q-analogues for \mathrm{tan}z and \mathrm{cot}z and then apply the theory of elliptic functions to establish a theta function identity. From this identity we deduce two q-trigonometric identities involving \mathrm{tan}_{q}z and \cot_{q}z, which are theta function analogues for two well-known trigonometric identities concerning \mathrm{tan}z and \cot z. Some other q-trigonometric identities are also given.
