In this paper, we construct metallic K\"ahler and nearly metallic K\"ahler structures on Riemanian manifolds. For such manifolds with these structures, we study curvature properties. Also we describe linear connections on the manifold, which preserve the associated fundamental 2-form and satisfy some additional conditions and present some results concerning them.
