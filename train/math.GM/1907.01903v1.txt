We introduce a kind of "perturbation" for the Li-Keiper coefficients around the Koebe function (the K function) and establish a closed system of Equations for the Li-Keiper coefficients. We then check the correctness of some of the many possible solutions offered by the system ,related to the discrete derivative of order n of a function. We also report numerical finding which support our stability conjecture that the tiny part lambda-tiny(n) (the fluctuations around the trend) are bounded in absolute values by gammaxn, where gamma is the Euler-Mascheroni constant.
