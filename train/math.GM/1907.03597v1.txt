The main intention of the paper is to investigate an osculating curve under the conformal map. We obtain a sufficient condition for the conformal invariance of an osculating curve. We also find an equivalent system of a geodesic curve under the conformal transformation(motion) and show its invariance under isometry and homothetic motion.
