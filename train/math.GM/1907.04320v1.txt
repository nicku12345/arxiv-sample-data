Let P(G,\lambda) denote the number of proper vertex colorings of G with \lambda colors. The chromatic polynomial P(C_n,\lambda) for the cycle graph C_n is well-known as P(C_n,\lambda) = (\lambda-1)^n+(-1)^n(\lambda-1) for all positive integers n\ge 1. Also its inductive proof is widely well-known by the \emph{deletion-contraction recurrence}. In this paper, we give this inductive proof again and three other proofs of this formula of the chromatic polynomial for the cycle graph C_n.
