The Collatz conjecture asserts that repeatedly iterating f(x) = (3x + 1)/2^{a(x)}, where a(x) is the highest exponent for which 2^{a(x)} exactly divides 3x+1, always lead to 1 for any odd positive integer x. Here, we present an arborescence graph constructed from iterations of g(x) = (2^{e(x)}x - 1)/3, which is the inverse of f(x) and where x \not \equiv [0]_3 and e(x) is any positive integer satisfying 2^{e(x)}x - 1 \equiv [0]_3, with [0]_3 denoting 0\pmod{3}. The integer patterns inferred from the resulting arborescence provide new insights into proving the validity of the conjecture.
