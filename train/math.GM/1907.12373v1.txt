Special functions have always played a central role in physics and in mathematics, arising as solutions of particular differential equations, or integrals, during the study of particular important physical models and theories in Quantum Mechanics, Thermodynamics, Fluid Dynamics, Viscoelasticity, et cetera. The aim of this short series of lectures is to provide a good treatise about the Exponential Integral special function, covering also a few selected topics like its generalisation, other related special functions (Sine Integral, Cosine Integral and the Logarithmic Integral) and the theory of Asymptotic Series.
