In this paper, we consider surfaces of revolution in the 3-dimensional Euclidean space E3 with nonvanishing Gauss curvature. We introduce the finite Chen type surfaces concerning the third fundamental form of the surface. We present a special case of this class of surfaces of revolution in E3, namely, surfaces of revolution where the sum of the radii of the principal curvature R is constant.
