This paper proves that a binary operation {\star} on {[0, 1]}, ensuring that the binary operation {\curlywedge} is a {t}-norm or {\curlyvee} is a {t}-conorm, is a {t}-norm, where {\curlywedge} and {\curlyvee} are special convolution operations defined by {(f\curlywedge g)(x)=\sup\left\{f(y)\star g(z): y\vartriangle z=x\right\},}  {(f\curlyvee g)(x)=\sup\left\{f(y)\star g(z): y\ \triangledown\ z=x\right\},}  for any {f, g\in Map([0, 1], [0, 1])}, where {\vartriangle} and {\triangledown} are a continuous {t}-norm and a continuous {t}-conorm on {[0, 1]}, answering negatively an open problem posed in \cite{HCT2015}. Besides, some characteristics of {t}-norm and {t}-conorm are obtained in terms of the binary operations {\curlywedge} and {\curlyvee}.
