The recent technique for estimating lower bounds of the prime counting function \pi(x)=#\{p \leq x: p\text{ prime}\} by means of the irrationality measures \mu(\zeta(s)) \geq 2 of special values of the zeta function claims that \pi(x) \gg \log \log x/\log \log \log x. This note improves the lower bound to \pi(x) \gg \log x, and extends the analysis to the irrationality measures \mu(\zeta(s)) \geq 1 for rational ratios of zeta functions.
