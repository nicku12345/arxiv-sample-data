Since squaring the circle was proved to be impossible, mathematicians have picked up a new hobby to square the circle 'approximately'. The most famous work is due to Ramanujan who gave a construction correct to 8 decimal places. In his book Mathographics, Dixon gave constructions correct to 3 decimal places and stated that his method was quite complicated. In this paper, we improve Dixon's method then give a new construction correct to 9 decimal places, a new record so far.
