A group-theoretical approach to the construction of quasiperiodic tilings of a Euclidean plane, possessing five-fold symmetry, is applied. Of the infinitely many of variants of quasiperiodic partitions of the plane, possessing the dihedral group of symmetry D5, special attention is paid to those that, can be obtained by one universal set, with consists five different tiles. Geometric characteristics of tiles from this set are determined. It is shown, by this set of tiles it is possible to carry out topologically different tilings of the plane, possessing rotating symmetries of both the fifth and tenth orders.
