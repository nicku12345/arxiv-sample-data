In the present paper, we investigate the special curves that are trajectories of a point on the elliptical 2-sphere. We examine the motion of charged particles on the elliptical 2-sphere while they are under the influence of a Killing vector field by using the elliptical inner product and elliptical cross product. Then, we obtain the curvatures and the parametric representations of all magnetic curves that the trajectories of a charged particle on the elliptical 2-sphere. Moreover, we review the curvatures and parametric representations of helices on the elliptical 2-sphere. We prove that helices on the elliptical 2-sphere are the curves described by a point on a great ellipse of the elliptical 2-sphere rolling without slipping on a fixed ellipse of the elliptical 2-sphere by using the elliptical motion. Furthermore, they are special cases of ellipsoidal cycloids and satellite curves on the elliptical 2-sphere. Finally, we present various examples and plotted their images on the elliptical 2-sphere.
