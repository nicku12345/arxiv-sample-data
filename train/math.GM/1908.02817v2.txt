In this paper, the concept of neutrosophic soft filter and its basic properties are introduced. Later, we set up a neutrosophic soft topology with the help of a neutrosophic soft filter. We also give the notions of the greatest lower bound and the least upper bound of the family of neutrosophic soft filters, neutrosophic soft filter subbase and neutrosophic soft filter base and explore some basic properties of them.
