In this paper, we investigate the geometric invariant properties of a normal curve on a smooth immersed surface under conformal transformation. We obtain an invariant-sufficient condition for the conformal image of a normal curve. We also find the deviations of normal and tangential components of the normal curve under the same motion. The results in \cite{9} are claimed as special cases of this paper.
