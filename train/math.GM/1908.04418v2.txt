Theory of representations of universal algebra is a natural development of the theory of universal algebra. In the book, I considered representation of universal algebra, diagram of representations and examples of representation. Morphism of the representation is the map that conserve the structure of the representation. Exploring of morphisms of the representation leads to the concepts of generating set and basis of representation.
