We present an eight-dimensional even sub-algebra of the 2^4 = 16-dimensional associative Clifford algebra Cl(4,0) and show that its eight-dimensional elements denoted as X and Y respect the norm relation ||XY|| = ||X|| ||Y||, thus forming an octonion-like but associative normed division algebra, where the norms are calculated using the fundamental geometric product instead of the usual scalar product so that the underlying coefficient algebra resembles that of split complex numbers instead of reals. The corresponding 7-sphere has a topology that differs from that of octonionic 7-sphere.
