In the first part of this article, we obtain a linear system whose the solution solves the time-independent incompressible Navier-Stokes system for the special case in which the external forces vector is a gradient. In a second step we develop approximate solutions, also for the time independent incompressible Navier-Stokes system, through the generalized method of lines. We recall that for such a method, the domain of the partial differential equation in question is discretized in lines and the concerning solution is written on these lines as functions of the boundary conditions and boundary shape. Finally, we emphasize these last main results are established through applications of the Banach fixed point theorem.
