This paper constructs a t_{r}-norm and a t_{r}-conorm on the set of all normal and convex functions from {[0, 1]} to {[0, 1]}, which are not obtained by using the following two formulas on binary operations {\curlywedge} and {\curlyvee}:  {(f\curlywedge g)(x)=\sup\left\{f(y)\ast g(z)\mid y\vartriangle z=x\right\},}   {(f\curlyvee g)(x)=\sup\left\{f(y)\ast g(z)\mid y\ \triangledown\ z=x\right\},}  where {f, g\in Map([0, 1], [0, 1])}, {\vartriangle} and {\triangledown} are respectively a {t}-norm and a {t}-conorm on {[0, 1]}, and {\ast} is a binary operation on {[0, 1]}. {\color{blue}This result answers affirmatively an open problem posed in \cite{HCT2015}. Moreover, the duality between t_r-norms and t_r-conorms is obtained by the introduction of operations dual to binary operations on {Map([0, 1], [0, 1])}.}
