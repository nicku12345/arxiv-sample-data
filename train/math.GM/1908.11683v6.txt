The Generalized Bessel Function (GBF) extends the single variable Bessel function to several dimensions and indices in a nontrivial manner. Two-dimensional GBFs have been studied extensively in the literature and have found application in laser physics, crystallography, and electromagnetics. In this article, we document several properties of m-dimensional GBFs including an underlying partial differential equation structure, asymptotics for simultaneously large order and argument, and analysis of generalized Neumann, Kapteyn, and Schl\"{o}milch series. We extend these results to mixed-type GBFs where appropriate.
