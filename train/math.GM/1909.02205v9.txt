For n \geq 3 let  p_n  denote the n^{\rm th} prime number. Let [ \; ] denote the floor or greatest integer function. For a positive integer m, let \pi_2(m), denote the number of twin primes not exceeding m. The twin prime conjecture states that there are infinitely many prime numbers p such that p+2 is also prime. In this paper we to show that for all integers a>0 there exists an integer N_2(a) such that    \left[\frac{ap^2_{n+1}}{2(n+1)} \right] \leq \pi_2\left(p^2_{n+1} \right)  for all n \geq N_2(a) and thereby prove the twin prime conjecture.
