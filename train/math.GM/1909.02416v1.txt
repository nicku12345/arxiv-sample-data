This paper presents some new inequalities, the most important of which is the inequality given in Theorem 2.1. It can solve a class of inequalities by a unified method. An important application of the inequality given in Theorem 2.1 is to derive another new general form of inequality. The famous Nesbitt's inequality is a special case of this general form of inequality when n = 3. The new inequality in Theorem 2.1 proposed in this paper is easy to use and expand, and many new inequalities can be derived and obtained by direct calculation, so it has a wide range of applications. Many known inequalities can also be directly calculated by the inequalities proposed in this paper, and the calculation is simple and convenient.
