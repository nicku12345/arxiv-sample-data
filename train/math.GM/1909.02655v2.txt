The inversion of nabla Laplace transform, corresponding to a causal sequence, is considered. Two classical methods, i.e., residual calculation method and partial fraction method are developed to perform the inverse nabla Laplace transform. For the first method, two alternative formulae are proposed when adopting the poles inside or outside of the contour, respectively. For the second method, a table on the transform pairs of those popular functions is carefully established. Besides illustrating the effectiveness of the developed methods with two illustrative examples, the applicability are further discussed in the fractional order case.
