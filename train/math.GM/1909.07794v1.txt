We show that a Fuchsian differential equation having five regular singular points admits solutions in terms of a single generalized hypergeometric function for infinitely many particular choices of equation parameters. Each solution assumes four restrictions imposed on the parameters: two of the singularities should have non-zero integer characteristic exponents and the accessory parameters should obey polynomial equations.
