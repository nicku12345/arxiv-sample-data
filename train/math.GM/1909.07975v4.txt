It's well known that every prime number p \geq 5 has the form 6k-1 or 6k+1. We'll call k the \textbf{generator} of p. Twin primes are distinghuished due to a \textbf{common generator} for each pair. Therefore it makes sense to search for the Twin Primes on the level of their generators. This paper present a new approach to prove the \textbf{Twin Prime Conjecture} by a sieve method to extract all Twin Primes on the level of the Twin Prime Generators. We define the \omega_{p_n}--numbers x as numbers for which holds that 6x-1 and 6x+1 are coprime to the prime p_n. By dint of the average distance \bar{\delta}(p_n) between the \omega_{p_n}--numbers we can prove the \textbf{Twin Prime Conjecture} indirectly.
