The meromorphic function W(s) introduced in the Riemann-Zeta function \zeta(s) = W(s) \zeta(1-s) maps the line of s = 1/2 + it onto the unit circle in W-space. |W(s)| = 0 gives the trivial zeroes of the Riemann-Zeta function \zeta(s). In the range: 0 < |W(s)| \neq 1, \zeta(s) does not have nontrivial zeroes. |W(s)|=1 is the necessary condition for the nontrivial zeros of the Riemann-Zeta function. Writing s = \sigma + it, in the range: 0 \leq \sigma \leq 1, but \sigma \neq 1/2, even if |W(s)|=1, the Riemann-Zeta function \zeta(s) is non-zero. Based on these arguments, the nontrivial zeros of the Riemann-Zeta function \zeta(s) can only be on the s = 1/2 + it critical line. Therefore a proof of the Riemann Hypothesis is presented.
