Let n be an integer and W_n be the Lambert W function. Let \log denote the natural logarithm so that \delta=-W_n(-\log2)/\log2. Given that a and r are respectively the first term and the constant ratio of an infinite geometric series, it is proved that the limit of convergence of the geometric series is \displaystyle\lim_{n\to\pm\infty}{a\big[r^\delta-1\big]\big[r-1\big]^{-1}} where r\neq1. By applying the geometric series formula above, it is further proved that the harmonic series \zeta(1) is given by \zeta(1)=-2\big[\log2+W_n(-\log2)\big] and as n\rightarrow\pm\infty, the value of \zeta(1) grows very slowly toward \tilde\infty, confirming the divergence of the harmonic series.
