Given a semigroup S generated by its squares equipped with an involutive automorphism \sigma and a multiplicative function \mu:S\to\mathbb{C} such that \mu(x\sigma(x))=1 for all x\in S, we determine the complex-valued solutions of the following functional equations \begin{equation*}f(xy)+\mu(y)f(\sigma(y)x)=2f(x)g(y),\, x,y\in S\end{equation*} and \begin{equation*}f(xy)+\mu(y)f(\sigma(y)x)=2f(y)g(x),\, x,y\in S\end{equation*}
