This paper is devoted to study the existence of a solution to Hilfer fractional differential equation with nonlocal boundary condition. We use the equivalent integral equation to study the considered Hilfer differential problem with nonlocal boundary condition. The Monch type fixed point theorem and the measure of the noncompactness technique are the main tools in this study. We demonstrate the existence of a solution with a suitable illustrative example.
