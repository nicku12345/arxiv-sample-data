The aim of this paper is to obtain the existence of unique solution to nonlinear Cauchy-type problem. We consider the implicit nonlinear Cauchy-type problem with \psi-Hilfer fractional derivative. The Banach fixed point theorem is used to obtain the existence of a unique solution whereas the generalized Gronwall inequality is used to discuss continuous data dependence of the solution. The results obtained herein are supported with illustrative example.
