In the present article, we first examine the conception of C*-algebra-valued controlled Fc-metric type spaces as a generalization of F-cone metric spaces over banach algebra. Further, we prove some fixed point theorem with different contractive conditions in the framework of C*-algebra-valued controlled Fc-metric type spaces. Secondly, we furnish an example by means of the acquired result.
