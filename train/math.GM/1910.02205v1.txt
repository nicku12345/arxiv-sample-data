In this paper, we discuss the characterizations and the relations of the \Gamma-convergence, the endograph metric and the sendograph metric on the realm of normal and upper semi-continuous fuzzy sets on metric space. It is found that both the \Gamma-convergence and the endograph metric have level decomposition property on fuzzy sets with their positive \al-cuts being compact. On the basis of these results, we give the characterizations of total boundedness, relative compactness and compactness in the space of compact positive \al-cuts fuzzy sets equipped with the endograph metric, and in the space of compact support fuzzy sets equipped with the sendograph metric, respectively.
