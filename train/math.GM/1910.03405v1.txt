In this paper, we introduce the concept of weak fuzzy linear topology on a fuzzy topological vector space as a generalization of usual weak topology. We prove that this topology consists of all weakly lower semi-continuous fuzzy sets on a given vector space when K (R or C) considered with its usual fuzzy topology. In the case that the topology of K is different from the usual fuzzy topology, we show that the weak fuzzy topology is not equivalent with the topology of weakly lower semi-continuous fuzzy sets.
