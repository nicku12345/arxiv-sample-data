We propose and prove a couple of formulas and infinite series involving the floor and the ceiling functions. Formula relating to the difference of floor and ceiling functions is obtained using aforementioned formulas. Partial summations of floor and ceiling of qth roots of natural numbers are equated as simple formulas. Particular cases of the series are taken into consideration and it is proven that both the cases relate to the Riemann-Zeta function. Poles for the both series are mentioned and it is shown that even if both series individually fail to converge at the pole, their difference is convergent at the same. It is shown that our formulas reduce to the Gauss formula and the series reduce to the Riemann-Zeta for a particular value. Further some special cases and scope for future work are discussed.
