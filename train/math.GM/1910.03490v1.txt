In this paper, closed forms of the summation formulas for generalized Tribonacci numbers are presented. Then, some previous results are recovered as particular cases of the present results. As special cases, we give summation formulas of Tribonacci, Tribonacci-Lucas, Padovan, Perrin, Narayana and some other third order linear recurrance sequences. All the summing formulas of well known recurrence sequences which we deal with are linear except the cases Pell-Padovan and Padovan-Perrin.
