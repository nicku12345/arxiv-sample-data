A route to evaluate exact sums represented by Dirichlet eta and beta functions, both of which are alternating and divergent at negative integer arguments, is advocated. It rests on precise polynomial extrapolations and stands as a generalization of an early endeavor on lattice sums. Apart from conferring a physical meaning to anti-limits, the scheme advanced here is direct, independent and computationally appealing. A new interpretation of summability is also gained.
