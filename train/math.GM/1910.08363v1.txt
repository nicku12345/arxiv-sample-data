The main result of the paper is a definition of possible ways of the confirmation of the Riemann hypothesis based on the properties of the vector system of the second approximate equation of the Riemann Zeta function. The paper uses a feature of calculating the Riemann Zeta function in the critical strip, where its approximate value is determined by partial sums of the Dirichlet series, which it is given. These expressions are called the first and second approximate equation of the Riemann Zeta function. The representation of the terms of the Dirichlet series by vectors allows us when analyzing the polyline formed by these vectors: 1) explain the geometric meaning of the generalized summation of the Dirichlet series in the critical strip; 2) obtain formula for calculating the Riemann Zeta function; 3) obtain the functional equation of the Riemann Zeta function based on the geometric properties of vectors forming the polyline; 4) explain the geometric meaning of the second approximate equation of the Riemann Zeta function; 5) obtain the vector equation of non-trivial zeros of the Riemann Zeta function; 6) determine why the Riemann Zeta function has non-trivial zeros on the critical line; 7) understand why the Riemann Zeta function cannot have non-trivial zeros in the critical strip other than the critical line.
