We extend some approach to a family of symmetric means (i.e. symmetric functions \mathscr{M} \colon \bigcup_{n=1}^\infty I^n \to I with \min\le \mathscr{M}\le \max; I is an interval). Namely, it is known that every symmetric mean can be written in a form \mathscr{M}(x_1,\dots,x_n):=F(f(x_1)+\cdots+f(x_n)), where f \colon I \to G and F \colon G \to I (G is a commutative semigroup). For G=\mathbb{R}^k or G=\mathbb{R}^k \times \mathbb{Z} (k \in \mathbb{N}) and continuous functions f and F we obtain two series of families (depending on k). It can be treated as a measure of complexity in a family of means (this idea is inspired by theory of regular languages and algorithmics). As a result we characterize celebrated families of quasi-arithmetic means (G=\mathbb{R}\times \mathbb{Z}) and Bajraktarevi\'c means (G=\mathbb{R}^2 under some additional assumptions). Moreover, we establish certain estimations of complexity for several other classical families.
