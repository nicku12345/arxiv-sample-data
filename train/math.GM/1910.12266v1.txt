In this paper, constructions of regular pentagon and decagon, and the calculation of the main trigonometric ratios of the corresponding central angles are approached. In this way, for didactic purposes, it is intended to show the reader that it is possible to broaden the study of Trigonometry by addressing new applications and exercises, for example, with angles 18{\deg}, 36{\deg} and 72{\deg}. It is also considered constructions of other regular polygons and a relation to a construction of the regular icosahedron.
