Let \Gamma be a simple connected undirected graph with vertex set V(\Gamma) and edge set E(\Gamma). The metric dimension of a graph \Gamma is the least number of vertices in a set with the property that the list of distances from any vertex to those in the set uniquely identifies that vertex. For an ordered subset W = \{w_1, w_2, ..., w_k\} of vertices in a graph \Gamma and a vertex v of \Gamma, the metric representation of v with respect to W is the k-vector r(v | W) = (d(v, w_1), d(v, w_2), ..., d(v, w_k )). If every pair of distinct vertices of \Gamma have different metric representations then the ordered set W is called a resolving set of \Gamma. It is known that the problem of computing this invariant is NP-hard. In this paper, we consider the problem of determining the cardinality \psi(\Gamma) of minimal doubly resolving sets of \Gamma, and the strong metric dimension for jellyfish graph JFG(n, m) and cocktail party graph CP(k+1).
