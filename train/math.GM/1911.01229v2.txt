The Collatz sequence for a given natural number N is generated by repeatedly applying the map N \rightarrow 3N+1 if N is odd and N \rightarrow N/2 if N is even. One elusive open problem in Mathematics is whether all such sequences end in 1 (Collatz conjecture), the alternative being the possibility of cycles or of unbounded sequences. In this paper, we present a formula relating the stopping time and the number of odd terms in a Collatz sequence, obtained numerically and tested for all numbers up to 10^7 and for random numbers up to 2^{128.000}. This result is presented as a conjecture, and with the hope that it could be useful for constructing a proof of the Collatz conjecture.
