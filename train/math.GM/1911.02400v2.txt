Collatz Conjecture is one of the most famous, for its simple form, proposed more than eighty years ago. This paper presents a full attempt to prove the affirmative answer to the question proposed by the conjecture. In the first section, we propose a number of definitions utilized later on the proof. In the second section, we discover the formula for a characteristic function. This formula describes the functionality of the paths taken for each number based on the Collatz Sequence. In the last section, we prove that every number will eventually reach 1, using the characteristic function.
