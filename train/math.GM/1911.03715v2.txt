In this article, we revisit some block matrix construction methods and use them to derive various general expansion formulas for calculating the ranks of matrix expressions. As applications, we derive a variety of interesting rank equalities for matrix expressions composed by idempotent matrices, and present their applications in the characterization of some matrix equalities for generalized inverses of partitioned matrices.
