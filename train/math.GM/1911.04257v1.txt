In this paper, the notations of \alpha-Q-fuzzy subset and \alpha-Q-fuzzy subgroup are introduced, and necessary properties related to these two concepts are proven. In the past part in this work, the effect of the \alpha-Q-fuzzy subgroup on the image and inverse-image under group anti-homomorphism are studied.
