In the present paper, we introduce bi-slant submersions from almost Hermitian manifolds onto Riemannian manifolds as a generalization of invariant, anti-invariant, semi-invariant, slant, semi-slant and hemi-slant Riemannian submersions. We mainly focus on bi-slant submersions from Kaehler manifolds. We provide a proper example of bi-slant submersion, investigate the geometry of foliations determined by vertical and horizontal distributions, and obtain the geometry of leaves of these distributions. Moreover, we obtain curvature relations between the base space, the total space and the fibres, and find geometric implications of these relations.
