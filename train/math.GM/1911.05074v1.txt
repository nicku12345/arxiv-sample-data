This paper mainly investigates the distributive laws between extended nullnorms and uninorms on fuzzy truth values under the condition that the nullnorm is conditionally distributive over the uninorm. It presents the distributive laws between the extended nullnorm and t-conorm, and the left and right distributive laws between the extended generalization nullnorm and uninorm, where a generalization nullnorm is an operator from the class of aggregation operators with absorbing element that generalizes a nullnorm.
