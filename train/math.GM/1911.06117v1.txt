We consider a point mass on a horizontal plane. The motion of the plane is given. The plane moves periodically such that all its points have congruent closed trajectories. There is the Coulomb friction between the point mass and the plane. We show that there exists a motion of the point mass such that the velocity of the point mass is an absolutely continuous periodic function. Mathematically the result is expressed as an existence theorem for a periodic solution to some differential inclusion.
