In this paper we prove that Neutrosophic Set (NS) is an extension of Intuitionistic Fuzzy Set (IFS) no matter if the sum of single-valued neutrosophic components is < 1, or > 1, or = 1. For the case when the sum of components is 1 (as in IFS), after applying the neutrosophic aggregation operators one gets a different result from that of applying the intuitionistic fuzzy operators, since the intuitionistic fuzzy operators ignore the indeterminacy, while the neutrosophic aggregation operators take into consideration the indeterminacy at the same level as truth-membership and falsehood-nonmembership are taken. NS is also more flexible and effective because it handles, besides independent components, also partially independent and partially dependent components, while IFS cannot deal with these. Since there are many types of indeterminacies in our world, we can construct different approaches to various neutrosophic concepts. Also, Regret Theory, Grey System Theory, and Three-Ways Decision are particular cases of Neutrosophication and of Neutrosophic Probability. We extended for the first time the Three-Ways Decision to n-Ways Decision, and the Spherical Fuzzy Set to n-HyperSpherical Fuzzy Set and to n-HyperSpherical Neutrosophic Set.
