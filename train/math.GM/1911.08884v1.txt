This manuscript investigates the existence and uniqueness of solutions to the first order fractional anti-periodic boundary value problem involving Caputo-Katugampola (CK) derivative. A variety of tools for analysis this paper through the integral equivalent equation of the given problem, fixed point theorems of Leray--Schauder, Krasnoselskii's, and Banach are used. Examples of the obtained results are also presented.
