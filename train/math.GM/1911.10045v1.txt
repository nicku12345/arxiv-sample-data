In this study, we establish a new integral inequalities of Hermite-Hadamard type for s-convexity via Katugampola fractional integral. This generalizes the Hadamard fractional integrals and Riemann-Liouville into a single form. We show that the new integral inequalities of Hermite-Hadamard type can be obtained via the Riemann-Liouville fractional integral. Finally, we give some applications to special means.
