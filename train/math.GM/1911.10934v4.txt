An explicit identity of sums of powers of complex functions presented via this a closed-form formula of Riemann zeta function produced at any given non-zero complex numbers. The closed-form formula showed us Riemann zeta function has no unique solution for any given non-zero complex numbers which means Riemann zeta function is entirely divergent. Infinitely many zeros of Riemann zeta function produced unfortunately those zeros also gives us non-zero values of Riemann zeta function. Among those zeros some of them are zeros of Riemann hypothesis. The present paper also discussed on eta function(alternating Riemann zeta function) with exactly the same behavior as Riemann zeta function.
