We consider two problems regarding some divisibility properties of the subset sums of a set A\subseteq \{1, 2, \ldots ,n\}. At the beginning, we study the cardinality of A which has the following property: For every d\le n there is a non empty set A_d\subseteq A such that the sum of the elements of A_d is a multiple of d. Next, we turn our attention to another problem: If all subset sums of A form a multiple free-sequence, what can we say about the structure of A? We give some asymptotics for the first problem and improve some already existing results for the second one.
