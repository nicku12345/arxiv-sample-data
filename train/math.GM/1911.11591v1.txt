In this article, we obtain sufficient conditions on existence, uniqueness and Ulam--Hyers stability of solutions for a coupled system of two-point nabla fractional difference boundary value problems, using Banach fixed point theorem and Urs's approach. Finally, we illustrate the applicability of established results through an example.
