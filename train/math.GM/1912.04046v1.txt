This research focuses on the Numerical approach for Fermat's Last theorem. We can induce an Alternative form of Fermat's last theorem by using particular geometric mapping \mathcal{M} on a Cartesian plane to a Torus. It transforms the Fermat's Last Theorem to finding a rational cross point between two parametric curves on the torus. In the end, this research shows the movement of the point, on the line x^n+y^n=1, has an acceleration phase transition near (x,n)=(0,2). Moreover, the studies about the relationship between this acceleration transition and the solution for the Fermat's Diophantine equation in the case of n>2, need further investigation.
