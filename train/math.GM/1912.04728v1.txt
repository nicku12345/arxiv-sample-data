The pedal of a curve in the Euclidean plane is a classical subject which has a singular point at the inflection point of the original curve. The primitive of a curve is a curve given by the inverse construction for making the pedal. We consider relatives of the primitive of a plane curve which we call primitivoids. We investigate the relationship of primitivoids and pedals of plane curves.
