In the present paper, the new generalized classes of (p,q)-starlike and (p,q)-convex functions are introduced by using the (p,q)-derivative operator. Also, the (p,q)-Bernardi integral operator for analytic function is defined in an open unit disc. Our aim for these classes is to investigate the Fekete-Szego inequalities. Moreover, Some special cases of the established results are discussed. Further, certain applications of the main results are obtained by applying the (p,q)-Bernardi integral operator
