Given a cyclic group G of order p^r, where p is a prime and r\in\mathbb{N}. It is well-known that the order of its greatest proper subgroup \psi(G) and the number of its generators \phi(G) satisfy \psi(G)+\phi(G)=p^r. In this paper, we give a linear version of this group theory theorem for primitive subspaces in a field extension using tools from field theory and linear algebra. We also discuss partitions of finite fields by using their primitive subspaces.
