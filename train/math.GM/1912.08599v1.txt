In this article, some logistic models in the settings of Caputo fractional operators with multi-parametered Mittag-Leffer kernels (ABC) are studied. This study mainly focuses on modified quadratic and cubic logistic models in the presence of a Caputo type fractional derivative. Existence and uniqueness theorems are proved and stability analysis is discussed by perturbing the equilibrium points. Numerical illustrative examples are discussed for the studied models.
