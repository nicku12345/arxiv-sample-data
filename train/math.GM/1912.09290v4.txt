For n \geq 1 let  p_n  denote the n^{\rm th} prime in the sequence of consecutive prime numbers in ascending order. Let S= \{1,7,11,13,17,19,23,29 \}, the set of integers which are both less than and relatively prime to 30. For  x \geq 0, let T_x = \{ 30x+i \; | \; i \in S\}. For each  x, T_x contains at most seven primes. Let [ \; ] denote the floor or greatest integer function. For each integer s \geq 30 let \pi_7(s) denote the number of integers x, \; 0 \leq x < [\frac {s}{30}] for which T_x contains seven primes. In this paper we show that for all integers  n  sufficiently large: \left[\frac {p^2_{n+4}}{30(n+1)} \right] \leq \pi_7\left(p^2_{n+4} \right) and thereby prove that there are infinitely many values of x for which T_x contains seven primes. This in turn proves several cases of Alphonse de Polignac's conjecture that for every even number k, there are infinitely many pairs of prime numbers p and p' for which p-p' = k.
