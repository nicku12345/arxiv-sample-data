In this paper, we study some new properties of Sadik transform such as integration, time delay, initial value theorem, and final value theorem. Moreover, we prove the theorem of Sadik transform for Caputo fractional derivative and we also establish sufficient conditions for the existence of the Sadik transform of Caputo fractional derivatives. At the end, the fractional-order dynamical systems in control theory as an application of this transform is discussed, in addition, some numerical examples to justify our results.
