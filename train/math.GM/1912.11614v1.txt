In the present article the author extends the Fourier transform to a more general class of functions; First to power-law functions with integer and half-integer exponents then to the widely used quantum statistics function (Fermi-Dirac and Bose-Einstein-distributions). The results are used to derive rather straightforwardly an integral formula. Moreover, generalized Fourier transforms are used to define fractional derivatives of distributions (generalized functions) and Fourier series (periodic functions) as well.
