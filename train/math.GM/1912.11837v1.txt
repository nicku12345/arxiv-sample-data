In this paper, a randomized algorithm for deciding the irreducibility of an irreducible polynomial and factoring a reducible polynomial over the field of rational numbers is presented. The main idea underlying the algorithm is based on conversion of a given polynomial into a polynomial with integer coefficients and reduction to mod p, for several large prime numbers p, without applying a lifting method.
