Inspired by graceful labelings and total labelings of graphs, we introduce the idea of total difference labelings. A k-total labeling of a graph G is an assignment of k distinct labels to the edges and vertices of a graph so that adjacent vertices, incident edges, and an edge and its incident vertices receive different labels. A k-total difference labeling of a graph G is a function f from the set of edges and vertices of G to the set \{1,2,\ldots,k\}, that is a k-total labeling of G and for which f(\{u,v\})=|f(u)-f(v)| for any two adjacent vertices u and v of G with incident edge \{u,v\}. The least positive integer k for which G has a k-total difference labeling is its total difference chromatic number, \chi_{td}(G). We determine the total difference chromatic number of paths, cycles, stars, wheels, gears and helms. We also provide bounds for total difference chromatic numbers of caterpillars, lobsters, and general trees.
