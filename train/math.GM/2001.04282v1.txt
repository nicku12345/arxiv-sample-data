Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) renormalizaion is a paradox. It uses the Euler-Mascheroni constant, which is defined by a conditionally convergent series. But Riemann's series theorem proves that any conditionally convergent series can be rearranged to be divergent. This contradiction (a series that is both convergent and divergent) is a paradox in "classical" logic, intuitionistic logic, and Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory, and also contradicts the commutative and associative properties of addition. Therefore QED is mathematically invalid. Zeta function regularization equates two definitions of the Zeta function at domain values where they contradict (where the Dirichlet series definition is divergent and Riemann's definition is convergent). Doing so either creates a paradox (if Riemann's definition is true), or is logically invalid (if Riemann's definition is false). We show that Riemann's definition is false, because the derivation of Riemann's definition includes a contradiction: the use of both the Hankel contour and Cauchy's integral theorem. Also, a third definition of the Zeta function is proven to be false. The Zeta function has no zeros, so the Riemann hypothesis is a paradox, due to material implication and "vacuous subjects".
