``Real Normed Algebras Revisited,'' the last paper of the late Gadi Moran, attempts to reconstruct the discovery of the complex numbers, the quaternions and the octonions, as well as proofs of their properties, using only what was known to 19th century mathematicians. In his research, Gadi had discovered simple and elegant proofs of the above-mentioned classical results using only basic properties of the geometry of Euclidean spaces and tools from high school geometry. His reconstructions underline an interesting connection between Euclidean geometry and these algebras, and avoid the advanced machinery used in previous derivations of these results. The goal of this article is to present Gadi's derivations in a way that is accessible to a wide audience of readers.
