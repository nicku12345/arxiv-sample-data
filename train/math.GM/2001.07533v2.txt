Recently we have reported a new method of rational approximation of the sinc function obtained by sampling and the Fourier transforms. However, this method involves a trigonometric multiplier  {e^{2\pi i\nu a}} = \cos \left( {2\pi \nu a} \right) + i\sin \left( {2\pi \nu a} \right),  where \nu  is the argument and a is the shift constant. In this work we show how to avoid this trigonometric multiplier in order to represent the Fourier transform of function f(t) in explicit form as a rational approximation of kind  \mathcal{F}\left\{ {f\left( t \right)} \right\}\left( \nu \right) = \int_{ - \infty }^\infty {f\left( t \right){e^{-2\pi i\nu t}}d\nu } \approx \frac{P\left( \nu \right)}{Q\left( \nu \right)},  where P\left( \nu \right) and Q\left( \nu \right) are polynomials. A MATLAB code showing algorithmic implementation of the proposed method for rational approximation of the Fourier transform is presented.
