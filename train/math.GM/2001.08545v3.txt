We prove new theorems for the polynomial expansions of x^n \pm y^n in terms of the binary quadratic forms \alpha x^2 + \beta xy + \alpha y^2  and a x^2 + bxy + a y^2 . The paper gives new arithmetic differential approach to compute the coefficients. Also, the paper gives generalization to well-known polynomial identity in the history of number theory. The paper highlights the emergence of a new class of polynomials that unify many well-known sequences including the Chebyshev polynomials of the first and second kind, Dickson polynomials of the first and second kind, Lucas and Fibonacci numbers, Mersenne numbers, Pell polynomials, Pell-Lucas polynomials, and Fermat numbers. Also, this paper highlights the emergence of the notions of trajectories and orbits of certain integers that passes through many well-known polynomials and sequences. The Lucas-Fibonacci trajectory, the Lucas-Pell trajectory, the Fibonacci-Pell trajectory, the Fibonacci-Lucas trajectory, the Chebyshev-Dickson trajectory of the first kind, the Chebyshev-Dickson trajectory of the second kind, and others are new trajectories included in this paper. Also, the Lucas orbit, Fibonacci orbit, Mersenne orbit, Lucas-Fibonacci orbit, Fermat orbit, and others are new orbits included in this paper.
