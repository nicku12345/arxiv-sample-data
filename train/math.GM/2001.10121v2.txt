The treated matrix equation (1+ae^{-\frac{\|X\|}{b}})X=Y in this short note has its origin in a modelling approach to describe the nonlinear time-dependent mechanical behaviour of rubber. We classify the solvability of (1+ae^{-\frac{\|X\|}{b}})X=Y in general normed spaces (E,\|\cdot\|) w.r.t. the parameters a,b\in\mathbb{R}, b\neq 0, and give an algorithm to numerically compute its solutions in E=\mathbb{R}^{m\times n}, m,n\in\mathbb{N}, m,n\geq 2, equipped with the Frobenius norm.
