The interval numbers is the set of compact intervals of \mathbb{R} with addition and multiplication operation, which are very useful for solving calculations where there are intervals of error or uncertainty, however, it lacks an algebraic structure with an inverse element, both additive and multiplicative This fundamental disadvantage results in overestimation of solutions in an interval equation or also overestimation of the image of a function over square regions. In this article we will present a solution to this problem, through a morphism that preserves both the addiction and the multiplication between the space of the interval numbers to the space of square diagonal matrices.
