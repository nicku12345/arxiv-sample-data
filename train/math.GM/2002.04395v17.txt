The present manuscript aims to derive an expression for the lower bound of the modulus of the Dirichlet eta function on vertical lines \Re(s)=\alpha. An approach based on a two-dimensional principal component analysis matching the dimensionality of the complex plane, which is built on a parametric ellipsoidal shape, has been undertaken to achieve this result. This lower bound, which is expressed as \forall s \in \, \mathbb{C} s.t. \Re(s) \in \mathcal{P}, |\eta(s)| \geq |1- \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2^{\alpha}}|, where \eta is the Dirichlet eta function, has implications for the Riemann hypothesis as |\eta(s)| >0 for any s \in \, \mathbb{C} s.t. \Re(s) \in \mathcal{P}, where \mathcal{P} is a partition spanning one half of the critical strip, on either sides of the critical line \Re(s) = 1/2 depending upon a variable.
