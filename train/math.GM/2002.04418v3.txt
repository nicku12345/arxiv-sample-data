This paper presents an alternative proof of the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra that has several distinct advantages. The proof is based on simple ideas involving continuity and differentiation. Visual software demonstrations can be used to convey the gist of the proof. A rigorous version of the proof can be developed using only single-variable calculus and basic properties of complex numbers, but the technical details are somewhat involved. In order to facilitate the reader's intuitive grasp of the proof, we first present the main points of the argument, which can be illustrated by computer experiments. Next we fill in some of the details, using single-variable calculus. Finally, we give a numerical procedure for finding all roots of an n'th degree polynomial by solving 2n differential equations in parallel.
