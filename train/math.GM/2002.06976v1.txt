This paper presents a simplified method of expressing the solution to cubic equations in terms of function evaluation only. The method eliminates the need to manipulate the original coefficients of the cubic polynomial and makes the solution free from such coefficients. In addition, the usual substitution needed to reduce the cubic equation is implicit in that the final solution is expressed in terms only of the function and derivative values of the given cubic polynomial at a single point. The proposed methodology simplifies the solution to cubic equations making them easy to remember and solve.
