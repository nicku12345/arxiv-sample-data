Both the ellipse and the hyperbola are geometric places that can be defined by establishing a relationship between points P of the plane and two fixed points A and B (which are its foci F'=A and F=B). Given two points A and B of the plan (which we no longer call the foci F and F'), we are going to present three geometric places associated with A and B other than the ellipse and the hyperbola.
