In this article, we characterize orders that are level-induced suborders anytime they are induced suborders of a superorder. We also characterize orders that are consecutive level-induced suborders anytime they are level-induced suborders of a superorder. Thus characterizing orders that are consecutive level-induced suborders anytime they are induced suborders of a superorder.
