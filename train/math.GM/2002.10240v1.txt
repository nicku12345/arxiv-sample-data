The first Zagreb index of a graph G is the sum of squares of the vertex degrees in a graph and the second Zagreb index of G is the sum of products of degrees of adjacent vertices in G. The imbalance of an edge in G is the numerical difference of degrees of its end vertices and the irregularity of G is the sum of imbalances of all its edges. In this paper, we extend the concepts of these topological indices for signed graphs and discuss the corresponding results on signed graphs.
