Let n\geq 2 and \mathbb K  be a number field of characteristic 0. Jacobian Conjecture asserts for a polynomial map \mathcal P from \mathbb K ^n to itself, if the determinant of its Jacobian matrix is a nonzero constant in \mathbb K  then the inverse \mathcal P^{-1} exists and is also a polynomial map. This conjecture was firstly proposed by Keller in 1939 for \mathbb K ^n=\mathbb C^2 and put in Smale's 1998 list of Mathematical Problems for the Next Century. This study is going to present a proof for the conjecture. Our proof is based on Dru{\.{z}}kowski Map and Hadamard's Diffeomorphism Theorem, and additionally uses some optimization idea.
