We have already seen simple representations of modular Lie algebras of A_l-type and C_l-type. We shall further investigate simple representations of B_l type, which turn out to be very similar in methodology as those types except for roots. So we may consider some conjectures relating to the representations of classical type modular Lie algebras.
