I found a novel class of magic square analogue, magic 24-cell. The problem is to assign the consecutive numbers 1 through 24 to the vertices in a graph, which is composed of 24 octahedra and 24 vertices, to make the sum of the numbers of each octahedron the same. It is known that there are facet-magic and face-magic labelings of tesseract. However, because of 24-cell contains triangle, face-magic labeling to assign different labels to each vertex is impossible. So I tried to make a cell-magic labeling of 24-cell. Linear combination of three binary labeling and one ternary labeling gives 64 different magic labelings of 24-cell. Due to similarity in the number of vertices between 5x5 magic square and magic 24-cell, It might be possible to calculate the number of magic 24-cell. Further analysis would be need to determine the number of magic 24-cell.
