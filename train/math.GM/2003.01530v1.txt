From the more than two hundred partial orders for fuzzy numbers proposes in the literature, only a few are totals. In this paper, we introduce the notion of admissible orders for fuzzy numbers equipped with a partial order, i.e. a total order which refines the partial order. In particular, is given special attention when thr partial order is the proposed by Klir and Yuan in 1995. Moreover, we propose a method to construct admissible orders on fuzzy numbers in terms of linear orders defined for intervals considering a strictly increasing upper dense sequence, proving that this order is admissible for a given partial order.
