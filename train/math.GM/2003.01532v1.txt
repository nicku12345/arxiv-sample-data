Let k\geq 1 be a small fixed integer. The rational approximations \left |p/q-\pi^{k} \right |>1/q^{\mu(\pi^k)} of the irrational number \pi^{k} are bounded away from zero. A general result for the irrationality exponent \mu(\pi^k) will be proved here. The irrationality exponents for the even parameters 2k correspond to those for the even zeta constants \zeta(2k). The specific results and numerical data for a few cases k=2 and k=3 are also presented and explained.
