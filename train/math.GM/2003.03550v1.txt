The main purpose of the present paper is to define and study the notion of quasi bi-slant submanifolds of almost contact metric manifolds. We mainly concerned with quasi bi-slant submanifolds of cosymplectic manifolds as a generalization of slant, semi-slant, hemi-slant, bi-slant and quasi hemi-slant submanifolds. First, we give non-trivial examples in order to demostrate the method presented in this paper is effective and investigate the geometry of distributions. Moreover, We study these types of submanifolds with parallel canonical structures.
