The goal of this paper is to formalize the notion of The Compositional Integral in The Complex Plane. We prove a convergence theorem guaranteeing its existence. We prove an analogue of Cauchy's Integral Theorem--and suggest an approach at recovering Cauchy's Integral Formula. With this we derive a modified form of Cauchy's Residue Theorem. Then, we develop a compositional analogue of Taylor Series. In finality, we describe a compositional Fourier Transform; and illustrate some basic properties of it.
