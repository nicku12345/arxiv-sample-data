This study handles spatial three-dimensional solution of the nonlinear diffusion equation without particular initial conditions. The functional behavior of the equation and the concentration have been studied in new ways. An auxiliary function for diffusion is given having an interesting relationship with the concentration. A set of new integro-differential equations is given for diffusion.
