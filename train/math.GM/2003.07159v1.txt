Perhaps the most significant, if not the most important, achievements in chemistry and physics are the Periodic Table of the Elements in Chemistry and the Standard Model of Elementary Particles in Physics. A comparable achievement in mathematics is the Periodic Table of Geometric Numbers discussed here. In 1878 William Kingdon Clifford discovered the defining rules for what he called geometric algebras. We show how these algebras, and their coordinate isomorphic geometric matrix algebras, fall into a natural periodic table, sidelining the superfluous definitions based upon tensor algebras and quadratic forms.
