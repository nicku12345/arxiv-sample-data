The Collatz conjecture is an unsolved problem in mathematics which introduced by Lothar Collatz in 1937. Although the prize for the proof of this problem is 1 million dollar, nobody has succeeded in proving this conjecture. However in this article, we will discuss the results of the author's research and come closer to the proof of this conjecture.
