In this paper we will show how to constructed an Skew-Field with trace-preserving endomorphisms of the affine plane. Earlier in my paper, we doing a detailed description of endomorphisms algebra and trace-preserving endomorphisms algebra in an affine plane, and we have constructed an associative unitary ring for which trace-preserving endomorphisms. In this paper we formulate and prove an important Lemma, which enables us to construct a particular trace-preserving endomorphism, with the help of which we can construct the inverse trace-preserving endomorphisms of every trace-preserving endomorphism. At the end of this paper we have proven that the set of trace-preserving endomorphisms together with the actions of 'addition' and 'composition' (which is in the role of 'multiplication') forms a skew-field.
