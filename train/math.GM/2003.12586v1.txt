Elementary Algebraic Geometry can be described as study of zeros of polynomials with integer degrees, this idea can be naturally carried over to `polynomials' with rational degree.   This paper explores affine varieties, tangent space and projective space for such polynomials and notes the differences and similarities between rational and integer degrees. The line bundles \mathcal{O}(n),n\in\mathbb{Q} are also constructed and their \v{C}ech cohomology computed.
