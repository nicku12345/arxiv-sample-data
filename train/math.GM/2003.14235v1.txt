Through the hands-on creation of two sashiko pieces of work - a counted thread kogin bookmark and a single running stitched hitomezashi sampler - participants will explore not only the living cultural history of this traditional Japanese needlework but will also experience the mathematics of sashiko in a tangible form, and will take away with them items of simple beauty.
