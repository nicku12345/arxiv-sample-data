This paper deals with an attempt of proof of the Riemann Hypothesis (RH). Let T>10^{10} arbitrarily large. Let the region \Omega_T=\Big\{z=x+i y\ \Big|\ \frac{1}{2}<x<1, \ 0<y<T\Big\}. There is a finite number N_T of roots of \zeta(z) in \Omega_T. The aim of the paper is to prove that N_T=0. Suppose that N_T>0. There exists at least one root \rho=\frac{1}{2}+{\bf u}+i\gamma  whose real part is greater or equal to the real part of all the other roots in \Omega_T. Let v\geq \frac{3}{2}. Let \varepsilon>0 arbitrarily small. We prove that f(z)=\frac{\zeta'(z)}{\zeta(z)} is analytic in the open disk \Omega_\varepsilon=\Big\{ \Big|z-\Big(\rho+\frac{\varepsilon}{2}+v\Big)\Big|\Big\}< v. Let s=\rho+\varepsilon. We prove, from the Taylor series of \zeta(s), that f(s)\sim \frac{1}{\varepsilon}\rightarrow \infty when \varepsilon\rightarrow 0, and that, through the representation of f(s) as a Taylor series, f(s)=f(c_0)-(v-\frac{\varepsilon}{2})f'(c_0) +\frac{(v-\frac{\varepsilon}{2})^2}{2!}f''(c_0)-\frac{(v-\frac{\varepsilon}{2})^3}{3!}f^{(3)}(c_0)+\dots\mbox{\ for\ }c_0=\rho+\frac{\varepsilon}{2}+v, in \Omega_\varepsilon, that f(s)\not\rightarrow \infty when \varepsilon\rightarrow 0, a contradiction which allows us to prove RH.
