The object of the present paper is to study \beta-almost Yamabe solitons and \beta-almost Ricci solitons on almost co-K\"{a}hler manifolds. In this paper, we prove that if an almost co-K\"{a}hler manifold M with the Reeb vector field \xi admits a \beta-almost Yamabe solitons with the potential vector field \xi or b\xi, where b is a smooth function then manifold is K-almost co-K\"{a}hler manifold or the soliton is trivial, respectively. Also, we show if a closed (\kappa,\mu)-almost co-K\"{a}hler manifold with n>1 and \kappa<0 admits a \beta-almost Yamabe soliton then the soliton is trivial and expanding. Then we study an almost co-K\"{a}hler manifold admits a \beta-almost Yamabe soliton or \beta-almost Ricci soliton with V as the potential vector field, V is a special geometric vector field.
