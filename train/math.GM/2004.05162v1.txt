This paper provides bounds for the number of terms, denoted by f, of a harmonic sum with the condition that it starts from any arbitrary unit fraction \frac{1}{m}, m > 1, until another unit fraction \frac{1}{m+f-1} such that the sum is the highest sum less than a particular positive integer q. Also, we consider the number of terms of Egyptian fractions whose terms are consecutive multiples of r, r \geq 1, under the same above condition. We end the paper with a formula for the case: q=1 and r=1.
