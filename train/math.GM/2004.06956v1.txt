The purpose of this paper is to bring to light a method through which the global in time existence for arbitrary large in H^1 initial data of a strong solution to 3D periodic Navier-Stokes equations follows. The method consists of subdividing the time interval of existence into smaller sub-intervals carefully chosen. These sub-intervals are chosen based on the hypothesis that for any wavenumber m, one can find an interval of time on which the energy quantized in low-frequency components (up to m) of the solution u is lesser than the energy quantized in high-frequency components (down to m) or otherwise the opposite. We associate then a suitable number m to each one of the intervals and we prove that the norm \|u(t)\|_{H^1} is bounded in both mentioned cases. The process can be continued until reaching the maximal time of existence T_{max} which yields the global in time existence of strong solution.
