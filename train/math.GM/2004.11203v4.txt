The paper substantiates the conjecture of the asymptotic behavior of the largest distance between consecutive primes: sup_{p_i \leq x}(p_{i+1}-p_i) \sim 2e^{-\gamma} \log^2(x), where \gamma is the Euler constant. The Hardy-Littlewood conjecture about the number of prime tuples is investigated and the rationale for this conjecture is given, taking into account the fact that a large natural number is not divisible by primes. It also substantiates why the accuracy of this conjecture is not affected by another assumption about the probability of a natural number being prime, although such a probability does not exist. The paper also considers the distribution of prime tuples using a mathematical model based on the Hardy-Littlewood conjecture.
