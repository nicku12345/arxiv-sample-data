Lehmer in his publication [6] defined a measure  \mu=\sum\limits_{j=1}^J\frac{1}{\log_{10}\left(\left|\beta_j\right|\right)},  where \beta_j is a set of the constants that may be either integers or rational numbers in the Machin-like formula for pi. At \beta _j\in\mathbb{Z} the Lehmer's measure can be used to determine computational efficiency of the given Marchin-like formula for pi. However, as a result of complexities in computation it remains unclear if the Lehmer's measure is applicable when at least one of the constants from the set \beta_j is a rational number. In this work we present a new algorithm for the two-term Machin-like formula for pi as an example for unconditional applicability of the Lehmer's measure. This approach does not involve any irrational numbers and may be promising for rapid convergence to pi by the Newton--Raphson iteration method for the tangent function.
