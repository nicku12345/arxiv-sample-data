A combination \mathbf{a}+\mathrm{i}\mathbf{b} where {\mathrm i}^2=-1 and \mathbf{a}, \, \mathbf{b} are real vectors is called a bivector. Gibbs developed a theory of bivectors, in which he associated an ellipse with each bivector. He obtained results relating pairs of conjugate semi-diameters and in particular considered the implications of the scalar product of two bivectors being zero. This paper is an attempt to develop a similar formulation for hyperbolas by the use of jay-vectors - a jay-vector is a linear combination \mathbf{a}+\mathrm{j}\mathbf{b} of real vectors \mathbf{a} and \mathbf{b}, where {\mathrm j}^2=+1 but {\mathrm j} is not a real number, so {\mathrm j}\neq\pm1. The implications of the vanishing of the scalar product of two jay-vectors is also considered. We show how to generate a triple of conjugate semi-diameters of an ellipsoid from any orthonormal triad. We also see how to generate in a similar manner a triple of conjugate semi-diameters of a hyperboloid and its conjugate hyperboloid. The role of complex rotations (complex orthogonal matrices) is discussed briefly. Application is made to second order elliptic and hyperbolic partial differential equations.
