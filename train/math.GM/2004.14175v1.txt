We find the equations that allow us to compute the position of the two interior nodes (weighted Fermat-Torricelli points) w.r. to the weighted Steiner problem for four points determining a tetrahedron in R^3. Furthermore, by applying the solution w.r. to the weighted Steiner problem for a boundary tetrahedron, we calculate the twist angle between the two weighted Steiner planes formed by one edge and the line defined by the two weighted Fermat- Torricelli points and a non-neighbouring edge and the line defined by the two weighted Fermat-Torricelli points.
