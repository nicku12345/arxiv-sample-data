The understanding of probability can be difficult for a few young scientists. Consequently, this new mathematical symbol, related to binomial coefficients and simplicial polytopic numbers, could be helpful to science education. Moreover, one can obtain kinds of remarkable identities and generalize them to a sort of "Newton's binomial theorem". Finally, this symbol could be perhaps useful to other scientific subjects as well, such as computer science.
