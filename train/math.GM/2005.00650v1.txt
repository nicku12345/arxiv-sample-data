We present a method for the solution of polynomial equations. We do not intend to present one more method among several others, because today there are many excellent methods. Our main aim is educational. Here we attempt to present a method with elementary tools in order to be understood and useful by students and educators. For this reason, we provide a self contained approach. Our method is a variation of the well known method of resultant, that has its origin back to Euler. Our goal, in the present paper, is in the spirit of calculus and secondary school mathematics. An extensive discussion of the theory of zeros of polynomials and extremal problems for polynomials the reader can find in the books 10 and 13 in our references.
