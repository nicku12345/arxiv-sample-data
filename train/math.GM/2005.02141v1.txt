Let G=(V,E) be a simple undirected and connected graph on n vertices. The Graovac--Ghorbani index of a graph G is defined as ABC_{GG}(G)= \sum_{uv \in E(G)} \sqrt{\frac{n_{u}+n_{v}-2} {n_{u} n_{v}}}, where n_u is the number of vertices closer to vertex u than vertex v of the edge uv \in E(G) and n_{v} is defined analogously. It is well-known that all bicyclic graphs with no pendant vertices are composed by three families of graphs, which we denote by \mathcal{B}_{n} = B_1(n) \cup B_2(n) \cup B_3(n). In this paper, we give an lower bound to the ABC_{GG} index for all graphs in B_1(n) and prove it is sharp by presenting its extremal graphs. Additionally, we conjecture a sharp lower bound to the ABC_{GG} index for all graphs in \mathcal{B}_{n}.
