We determine a positive real number (weight), which corresponds to a vertex of a tetrahedron and it depends on the three weights which correspond to the other three vertices and an infinitesimal number \epsilon. As a limiting case, for \epsilon\to 0, the quad of the corresponding weights yields a degenerate weighted Fermat-Torricelli tree which coincides with the three neighbouring edges of the tetrahedron and intersect at this vertex.
