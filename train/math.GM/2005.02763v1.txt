In this work we study differential geometry in N dimensional Riemann curved spaces using Pfaff derivatives. Avoiding the classical partial derivative the Pfaff derivatives are constructed in a more sophisticated way and make evaluations become easier. In this way Christofell symbols \Gamma_{ikj} of classical Riemann geometry as also the elements of the metric tensor g_{ij} are replaced with one symbol (the q_{ikj}). Actually to describe the space we need no usage of the metric tensor g_{ij} at all. We also don't use Einstein's notation and this simplifies also things a lot. For example we don't have to use upper and lower indexes, which in eyes of a beginner, is quite messy. Also we don't use the concept of tensor. All quantities of the surface or curve or space which form a tensor field are called invariants or curvatures of the space. Several new ideas are developed in this basis.
