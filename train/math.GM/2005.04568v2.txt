We improve the estimation of the distribution of the nontrivial zeros of Riemann zeta function \zeta(\sigma+it) for sufficiently large t, which is based on an exact calculation of some special logarithmic integrals of nonvanishing \zeta(\sigma+it) along well-chosen contours. A special and single-valued coordinate transformation s=\tau(z) is chosen as the inverse of z=\chi(s), and the functional equation \zeta(s) = \chi(s)\zeta(1-s) is simplified as G(z) = z\, G_-(\frac{1}{z}) in the z coordinate, where G(z)=\zeta(s)=\zeta\circ\tau(z) and G_- is the conjugated branch of G. Two types of special and symmetric contours \partial D_{\epsilon}^1 and \partial D_{\epsilon}^2 in the s coordinate are specified, and improper logarithmic integrals of nonvanishing \zeta(s) along \partial D_{\epsilon}^1 and \partial D_{\epsilon}^2 can be calculated as 2\pi i and 0 respectively, depending on the total increase in the argument of z=\chi(s). Any domains in the critical strip for sufficiently large t can be covered by the domains D_{\epsilon}^1 or D_{\epsilon}^2, and the distribution of nontrivial zeros of \zeta(s) is revealed in the end, which is more subtle than Riemann's initial hypothesis and in rhythm with the argument of \chi(\frac{1}{2}+it).
