In this article, we study the class of surfaces of revolution in the 3-dimensional Euclidean space E^{3} with nonvanishing Gauss curvature whose position vector \boldsymbol{x} satisfies the condition \Delta^{II}\boldsymbol{x}=A\boldsymbol{x}, where A is a square matrix of order 3 and \Delta^{II} denotes the Laplace operator of the second fundamental form II of the surface. We show that a surface of revolution satisfying the preceding relation is a catenoid or part of a sphere.
