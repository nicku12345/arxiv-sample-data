A proof of the Riemann hypothesis is proposed by relying on the properties of the Mellin transform. The function \mathfrak{G}_{\eta}\left(t\right) is defined on the set \bar{\mathbb{R}}_+ of the non-negative real numbers, in term of a special power series, in such a way that the Mellin transform \hat{\mathfrak{G}}_{\eta}\left(s\right) of the function \mathfrak{G}_{\eta}\left(t\right) does not vanish in the fundamental strip 0<\operatorname{Re} s <1/2. In this strip every zero of the Riemann zeta function \zeta\left(1-s\right) is a zero of the function \hat{\mathfrak{G}}_{\eta}\left(s\right). Consequently, it is proved that no zero of the Riemann zeta function \zeta\left(s\right) exists in the strip 1/2<\operatorname{Re} s <1. The reflection relations, which hold around the line \operatorname{Re} s =1/2 for s\neq 0,1, prove that no zero of the Riemann zeta function \zeta\left(s\right) exists in the strip 0<\operatorname{Re} s<1/2. In conclusion, it is proved that no zero of the Riemann zeta function \zeta\left(s\right) exists in the strip 0<\operatorname{Re} s<1 for \operatorname{Re} s\neq 1/2.
