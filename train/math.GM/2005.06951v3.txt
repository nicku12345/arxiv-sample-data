The non-elementary integrals involving elementary exponential, hyperbolic and trigonometric functions,  \int x^\alpha e^{\eta x^\beta}dx, \int x^\alpha \cosh\left(\eta x^\beta\right)dx, \int x^\alpha \sinh\left(\eta x^\beta\right)dx, \int x^\alpha \cos\left(\eta x^\beta\right)dx and \int x^\alpha \sin\left(\eta x^\beta\right)dx  where \alpha, \eta and \beta are real or complex constants are evaluated in terms of the confluent hypergeometric function _1F_1 and the hypergeometric function _1F_2. The hyperbolic and Euler identities are used to derive some identities involving exponential, hyperbolic, trigonometric functions and the hypergeometric functions _1F_1 and _1F_2. Having evaluated, these non-elementary integrals, some new probability measures generalizing the gamma-type and normal distributions are also obtained. The obtained generalized distributions may, for example, allow to perform better statistical tests than those already known (e.g. chi-square (\chi^2) statistical tests and those based on central limit theorem (CLT)).
