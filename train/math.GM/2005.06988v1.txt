With a new proof approach we prove in a more general setting the classical convergence theorem that almost everywhere convergence of measurable functions on a finite measure space implies convergence in measure. Specifically, we generalize the theorem for the case where the codomain is a separable metric space and for the case where the limiting map is constant and the codomain is an arbitrary topological space.
