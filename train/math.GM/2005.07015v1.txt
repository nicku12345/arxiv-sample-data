Quantum theory is awash in multidimensional integrals that contain exponentials in the integration variables, their inverses, and inverse polynomials of those variables. The present paper introduces a means to reduce pairs of such integrals to one dimension when the integrand contains powers times an arbitrary function of xy/(x+y) multiplying various combinations of exponentials. In some cases these exponentials arise directly from transition-amplitudes involving products of plane waves, hydrogenic wave functions, Yukawa and/or Coulomb potentials. In other cases these exponentials arise from Gaussian transforms of such functions.
