A perfect cuboid, popularly known as a perfect Euler brick/a perfect box, is a cuboid having integer side lengths, integer face diagonals and an integer space diagonal. Euler provided an example where only the body diagonal became deficient for an integer value but it is known as an Euler brick. Nobody has discovered any perfect cuboid, however many of us have tried it. The results of this research paper prove that there exists no perfect cuboid.
