Grassmann angles improve upon similar concepts of angle between subspaces that measure volume contraction in orthogonal projections, working for real or complex subspaces, and being more efficient when dimensions are different. Their relations with contractions, inner and exterior products of multivectors are used to obtain formulas for computing these or similar angles in terms of arbitrary bases, and various identities for the angles with certain families of subspaces. These include generalizations of the Pythagorean trigonometric identity \cos^2\theta+\sin^2\theta=1 for high dimensional and complex subspaces, which are connected to generalized Pythagorean theorems for volumes, quantum probabilities and Clifford geometric product.
