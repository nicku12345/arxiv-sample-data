We introduce a novel set-intersection operator called `most-intersection' based on the logical quantifier `most', via natural density of countable sets, to be used in determining the majority characteristic of a given countable (possibly infinite) collection of systems. The new operator determines, based on the natural density, the elements which are in `most' sets in a given collection. This notion allows one to define a majority set-membership characteristic of an infinite/finite collection with minimal information loss, compared to the standard intersection operator, when used in statistical ensembles. We also give some applications of the most-intersection operator in formal language theory and hypergraphs. The introduction of the most-intersection operator leads to a large number of applications in pure and applied mathematics some of which we leave open for further study.
