The aim of this paper is to discus the relations between various notions of sequential completeness and the corresponding notions of completeness by nets or by filters in the setting of quasi-metric spaces. We propose a new definition of right K-Cauchy net in a quasi-metric space for which the corresponding completeness is equivalent to the sequential completeness. In this way we complete some results of R.~A. Stoltenberg, Proc. London Math. Soc. \textbf{17} (1967), 226--240, and V.~Gregori and J.~Ferrer, Proc. Lond. Math. Soc., III Ser., \textbf{49} (1984), 36.
