A study of 7-fold tilings that use a set of three proto-rhombs in a substitution scheme to tile a large area. A set is discovered that is thought to be the most minimal or smallest one. The scheme uses 11 proto-rhombs to tile the next generation of inflated tiles. The general form of 7-fold substitutions is shown and the role of the 7-fold magic number phi is derived. The figures include a number of newly discovered 7-fold tilings.
