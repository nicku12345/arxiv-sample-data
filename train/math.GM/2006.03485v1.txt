We study the 2N-dimensional canonical systems and discuss some properties of its fundamental solution. We then discuss the Floquet theory of periodic canonical systems and observe the asymptotic behavior of its solution. Some important physical applications of the systems are also discussed: linear stability of periodic Hamiltonian systems, position-dependent effective mass, pseudo-periodic nonlinear water waves, and Dirac systems.
