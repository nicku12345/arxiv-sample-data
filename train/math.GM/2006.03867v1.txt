We remark a variant of the existence part of the fundamental theorem of calculus, which, together with the Lebesgue differentiation theorem, constitute a new proof that every Riemann-integrable function on a compact interval having limit everywhere on the interior is almost everywhere continuous with respect to Lebesgue measure. The proof is intended as a new connection between Lebesgue differentiation theorem and Lebesgue criterion of Riemann integrability.
