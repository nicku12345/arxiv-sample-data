This study is an example of a solid connection between fractional analysis and inequality theory, and includes new inequalities of the P\'{o}lya-Szeg% \"{o}-Chebyshev type obtained with the help of Generalized Proportional Fractional integral operators. The results have been performed by using Generalized Proportional Fractional integral operators, some classical inequalities such as AM-GM inequality, Cauchy-Schwarz inequality and Taylor series expansion of exponential function. The findings give new approaches to some types of inequalities that have involving the product of two functions in inequality theory.
