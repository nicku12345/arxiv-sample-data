We study quadric surfaces in the 3-dimensional Euclidean space which are of coordinate finite type Gauss map with respect to the second fundamental form II, i.e., their Gauss map vector \boldsymbol{n} satisfies the relation \Delta ^{II}\boldsymbol{n}=\varLambda \boldsymbol{n}, where \Delta ^{II} denotes the Laplace operator of the second fundamental form II of the surface and \varLambda is a square matrix of order 3. We show that helicoids and spheres are the only class of surfaces mentioned above satisfying \Delta ^{II}\boldsymbol{n}=\varLambda \boldsymbol{n}.
