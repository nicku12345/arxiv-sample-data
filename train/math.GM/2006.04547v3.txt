A celebrated conjecture of Hardy and Littlewood provides with an asymptotic formula for the counting function of the twin primes. We give an unconditional proof of such a formula by means of a finite Ramanujan expansion of the counting function expressed in terms of the von Mangoldt function and its incomplete form. In a completely analogous way, we solve the conjugate conjecture on the representations of any even integer as the sum of two prime numbers.
