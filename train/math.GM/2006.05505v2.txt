A matrix is well separated if all its Gershgorin circles are away from the unit circle and they are separated from each other. In this article, the region of relative errors in the eigenvalues is obtained as a quadratic oval for non diagonal perturbation of well seperated matrices. Thus giving a computable relative error bound in terms of Gershgorin circle parameters. When the separation is O(n) and the matrix is positive definite, an interlacing theorem for the eigenvalues under perturbation is presented. Further when the separation is O(n^2 ), condition number of the eigenvector matrix is upper bounded to obtain the region of perturbed eigenvalue. Numerical results show the relation between diagonal entries and the magnitude of the eigenvector entries even when the matrix is not so well separated. We exploit this trend in estimating the Perron vector using power method.
