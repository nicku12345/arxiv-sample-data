The concept of gyrogroups is a generalization of groups which do not explicitly have associativity. In this paper, the notion of fuzzy gyronorms on gyrogroups is introduced. The relations of fuzzy metrics (in the sense of George and Veeramani), fuzzy gyronorms and gyronorms on gyrogroups are studied. Also, the fuzzy metric structures on fuzzy normed gyrogroups are discussed. In the last, the fuzzy metric completion of a gyrogroup with an invariant metric are studied. We mainly show that let d be an invariant metric on a gyrogroup G and (\widehat{G},\widehat{d}) is the metric completion of the metric space (G,d); then for any continuous t-norm \ast, the standard fuzzy metric space (\widehat{G},M_{\widehat{d}},\ast) of (\widehat{G},\widehat{d}) is the (up to isometry) unique fuzzy metric completion of the standard fuzzy metric space (G,M_d,\ast) of (G,d); furthermore, (\widehat{G},M_{\widehat{d}},\ast) is a fuzzy metric gyrogroup containing (G,M_d,\ast) as a dense fuzzy metric subgyrogroup and M_{\widehat{d}} is invariant on \widehat{G}. Applying this result, we obtain that every gyrogroup G with an invariant metric d admits an (up to isometric) unique complete metric space (\widehat{G},\widehat{d}) of (G,d) such that \widehat{G} with the topology introduced by \widehat{d} is a topology gyrogroup containing G as a dense subgyrogroup and \widehat{d} is invariant on \widehat{G}.
