In this paper, we present some fixed point results for generalized \theta -\phi -contraction in the framework of \left( \alpha ,\eta \right)-compete rectangular b-metric spaces. Further, we establish some fixed point theorems for this type of mappings defined on such spaces. The presented extend, generalize and improve existing results in the literature. Moreover, to support our main results we give an illustrative example.
