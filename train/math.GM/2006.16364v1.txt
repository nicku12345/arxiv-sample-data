We present a matrix version of a known method of constructing common eigenvectors of two diagonalizable commuting matrices, thus enabling their simultaneous diagonalization. The matrices may have simple eigenvalues of multiplicity greater than one. The singular value decomposition (SVD) of a class of commuting matrices also is treated. The effect of row/column permutation is examined. Examples are given.
