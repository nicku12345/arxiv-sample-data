This work provides a complete characterization of congruent numbers in terms of Pythagorean triples. Specifically, we show that every congruent number can be written as \frac{nm\left(m-n\right)\left(m+n\right)}{\sigma^2} were as \sigma \vert \rho\biggl(\left(m-n\right)\left(m+n\right)\biggr),\indent \text{or} \indent \sigma \vert \rho( nm ) were \rho(\alpha) denotes the non-square free part of its argument \alpha. As a consequence, in order to find congruent numbers it suffices to devise a condition so that the equality \mu(m-n)+1 = \gcd(m,n) or \mu(m+n)+1 =\gcd(m,n) holds, were \mu is the Mobius function.
