In this paper, we continue the classification of finite type Gauss map surfaces in the 3-dimensional Euclidean space \mathbb{E}^{3}. We present an important family of surfaces, namely, tubes in \mathbb{E}^{3}. We show that the Gauss map of a tube is of an infinite type corresponding to the second fundamental form.
