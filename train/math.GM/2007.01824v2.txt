A space  X  is said to be set star-Lindel\"{o}f (resp., set strongly star-Lindel\"{o}f) if for each nonempty subset  A  of  X  and each collection  \mathcal{U}  of open sets in  X  such that  \overline{A} \subset \bigcup \mathcal{U} , there is a countable subset  \mathcal{V} of  \mathcal{U}  (resp., countable subset  F  of  \overline{A} ) such that  A \subset St( \bigcup \mathcal{V}, \mathcal{U}) (resp.,  A \subset St( F, \mathcal{U})). The class of set star-Lindel\"{o}f and set strongly star-Lindel\"{o}f spaces lie between Lindel\"{o}f and star-Lindel\"{o}f spaces. In this paper, we investigate the relationship among set star-Lindel\"{o}f spaces, set strongly star-Lindel\"{o}f spaces and other related spaces and study the topological properties of set star-Lindel\"{o}f spaces. Some open problems are posed.
