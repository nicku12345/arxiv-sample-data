A short survey on the properties of four graphs constructed in \{0, 1\}^n Boolean space is presented. Flexible activation function of an artificial neuron in a sparse distributed memory model is defined on the basis of the Ugly duckling theorem. Cotan Laplacian on 2-face triangulation of n-cube has degenerate spectrum of eigenvalues corresponding to the Hamming distance distribution of \{0, 1\}^n space. Degenerate spectrum of eigenvalues of the cotan Laplacian defined on the graph comprising 2^n 2-face triangulated n-cubes sharing common origin includes all integers from 0 to 3n, without the eigenvalue of 3n-1 (multiplicities of the same eigenvalues form A038717 OEIS sequence), while the multiplicities of the same eigenvalues [-n\sqrt{2}, n\sqrt{2}] of the adjacency matrix of 2^n-cube form trinomial triangle. The distance matrix of this graph, providing further OEIS sequences, as well as its relation with Buckminster Fuller vector equilibrium is also discussed.
