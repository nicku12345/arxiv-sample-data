Let \sum_{\substack{d|n\\ d\equiv 1 (2)}}\frac{1}{d} denote the sum of inverses of odd divisors of a positive integer n, and let c_{r}(n) be the number of representations of n as a sum of r squares where representations with different orders and different signs are counted as distinct. The aim is of this note is to prove the following interesting combinatorial identity:  \sum_{\substack{d|n\\ d\equiv 1 (2)}}\frac{1}{d}=\frac{1}{2}\,\sum_{r=1}^{n}\frac{(-1)^{n+r}}{r}\,\binom{n}{r}\, c_{r}(n).
