We construct a two-parameter complex function \eta_{\kappa \nu}:\mathbb{C}\to \mathbb{C}, \kappa \in (0, \infty), \nu\in (0,\infty) that we call a holomorphic nonlinear embedding and that is given by a double series which is absolutely and uniformly convergent on compact sets in the entire complex plane. The function \eta_{\kappa \nu} converges to the Dirichlet eta function \eta(s) as \kappa \to \infty. We prove the crucial property that, for sufficiently large \kappa, the function \eta_{\kappa \nu}(s) can be expressed as a linear combination \eta_{\kappa \nu}(s)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}a_n(\kappa) \eta(s+2\nu n) of horizontal shifts of the eta function (where a_{n}(\kappa) \in \mathbb{R} and a_{0}=1) and that, indeed, we have the inverse formula \eta(s)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}b_n(\kappa) \eta_{\kappa \nu}(s+2\nu n) as well (where the coefficients b_{n}(\kappa) \in \mathbb{R} are obtained from the a_{n}'s recursively). By using these results and the functional relationship of the eta function, \eta(s)=\lambda(s)\eta(1-s), we sketch a proof of the Riemann hypothesis which, in our setting, is equivalent to the fact that the nontrivial zeros s^{*}=\sigma^{*}+it^{*} of \eta(s) (i.e. those points for which \eta(s^{*})=\eta(1-s^{*})=0) are all located on the critical line \sigma^{*}=\frac{1}{2}.
