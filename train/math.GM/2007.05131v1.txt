The problem of measuring an unbounded system attribute near a singularity has been discussed. Lenses have been introduced as formal objects to study increasingly precise measurements around the singularity and a specific family of lenses called Exterior probabilities have been investigated. It has been shown that under such probabilities, measurement variance of a measurable function around a 1st order pole on a complex manifold, consists of two separable parts - one that decreases with diminishing scale of the lenses, and the other that increases. It has been discussed how this framework can lend mathematical support to ideas of non-deterministic uncertainty prevalent at a quantum scale. In fact, the aforementioned variance decomposition allows for a minimum possible variance for such a system irrespective of how close the measurements are. This inequality is structurally similar to Heisenberg uncertainty relationship if one considers energy/momentum to be a meromorphic function of a complex spacetime.
