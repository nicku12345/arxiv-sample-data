In this expository note, we introduce the reader to compositions of a natural number, e.g., 2+1+2+1+7+1 is a composition of 14, and 1+2 and 2+1 are two different compositions of 3. We discuss some simple restricted forms of compositions, e.g., 23+17+33 is a composition of 73 into three odd parts. We derive formulas that count the number of so restricted forms of compositions of a natural number n, and we conclude with a brief general discussion of the topic.
