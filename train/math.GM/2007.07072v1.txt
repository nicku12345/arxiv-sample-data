Successful application of Adomian decomposition method (ADM) in solving problems in nonlinear ordinary and partial differential equations depend strictly on the Adomian polynomial. In this paper, we present a simple modified known Adomian polynomial for nonlinear polynomial functionals with index as integers. The simple modified Adomian polynomial was tested for nonlinear functional with index 3 and 4 respectively. The result shows remarkable exact results as that given by Adomian himself. Also, the modifed simple Adomian polynomial was further tested on concrete problems and the numerical results were exactly the same as the exact solution. The large scale computation and evaluation was made possible by Maple software package.
