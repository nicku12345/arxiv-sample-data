The main objective of present investigation to obtain some Minkowski-type fractional integral inequalities using generalised proportional Hadamard fractional integral operators which is introduced by Rahman et al in the paper (certain inequalities via generalized proportional Hadamard fractional integral operators), Advances in Differential Equations, (2019), 2019:454. In addition, we establish some other fractional integral inequalities for positive and continuous functions.
