This paper presents a novel direct elementary proof for Fermat's Last Theorem. We use algebra, modular math, and binomial series to develop inherent mathematical relationships hidden within Fermat's Last Theorem. With these derived relationships, we are able to develop general pattern applicable for all positive integers of n. Finally, we are able to confirm and complete the direct proof for Fermat's Diophantine equation for all n.
