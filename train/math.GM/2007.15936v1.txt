Let p be an odd prime, and consider the map H_{p} which sends an integer x to either \frac{x}{2} or \frac{px+1}{2} depending on whether x is even or odd. The values at x=0 of arbitrary composition sequences of the maps \frac{x}{2} and \frac{px+1}{2} can be parameterized over the 2-adic integers (\mathbb{Z}_{2}) leading to a continuous function from \mathbb{Z}_2 to \mathbb{Z}_p which the author calls the numen of H_{p}, denoted \chi_p; the p=3 case turns out to be an alternative version of the Syracuse Random Variables constructed by Tao [arXiv:1909.03562]. This paper establishes the Correspondence Theorem, which shows that an odd integer \omega is a periodic point of H_p if and only if \omega=\chi_{p}\left(n\right)/\left(1-r_{p}\left(n\right)\right) for some integer n\geq1, where r_{p}\left(n\right) = p^{\#_{1}\left(n\right)} / 2^{\lambda\left(n\right)}, where \#_1 \left(n\right) is the number of 1s digits in the binary expansion of n and \lambda\left(n\right) is the number of digits in the binary expansion of n. Using this fact, the bulk of the paper is devoted to examining the Dirichlet series associated to \chi_p and r_p, which are used along with Perron's Formula to reformulate the Correspondence Theorem in terms of contour integrals, to which Residue calculus is applied so as to obtain asymptotic formulae for the quantities therein. A sampling of other minor results on \chi_p are also discussed in the paper's final section.
