A structured approach for the Collatz conjecture is presented using just the odd integers that are, in turn, divided into categories based on the roles they play such as Starter, Intermediary and Terminal. The expression 4x+1 is used as a tool to expose all the hidden and significant characteristics of the conjecture that lead us to its proof. The mixing properties of the iterates are addressed by showing that the Collatz iterates of half of all the odd integers that are of the form 4m+3, on the average, increase by three times the value of the odd integer that was used to start with, while the iterates of those of 4m+1, on the average, decrease by a factor of four. Further, expressions are provided to generate all the sets of odd integers where the Collatz iterate of all the integers in each set is an integer of the of form 6m+1 or 6m+5. The significance of the Collatz net (tree) becomes obvious since it encompasses all the Collatz trajectories.
