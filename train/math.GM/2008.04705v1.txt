The Riemann Hypothesis is the main open problem of Number Theory and several scientists are trying to solve this problem. In this regard, in a recent work [8], a difference equation has been proposed that calculates the nth non-trivial zero in the critical range. In this work, we seek to optimize this estimation by calculating Lyapunov numbers for this non-linear map in order to seek the best value for the bifurcation parameter. Analytical results are presented.
