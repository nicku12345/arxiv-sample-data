In this short note, we present the sharp estimate for the existence of a unique solution for a Hadamard-type fractional differential equations with two-point boundary value conditions. The method of analysis is obtained by using the integral of the Green's function and the Banach contraction principle. Further, we will also obtain a sharper lower bound of the eigenvalues for an eigenvalue problem. Two examples are presented to clarify the applicability of the essential results.
