For a group G, we denote by \stackrel{\leftrightarrow}{G} the coarse space on G endowed with the coarse structure with the base \{\{ (x,y)\in G\times G: y\in x^F \} : F \in [G]^{<\omega} \}, x^F = \{z^{-1} xz : z\in F \}. Our goal is to explore interplays between algebraic properties of G and asymptotic properties of \stackrel{\leftrightarrow}{G}. In particular, we show that asdim \ \stackrel{\leftrightarrow}{G} = 0 if and only if G / Z_G is locally finite, Z_G is the center of G. For an infinite group G, the coarse space of subgroups of G is discrete if and only if G is a Dedekind group.
