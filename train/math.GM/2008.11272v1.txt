Let R be an associative ring with identity 1. We describe all matrices in T_n(R) the ring of n\times n upper triangular matrices over R (n\in \mathbb{N}), and T_{\infty}(R) the ring of infinite upper triangular matrices over R, satisfying the quadratic polynomial equation x^2-rx+s=0. For such propose we assume that the above polynomial have two different roots in R. Moreover, in the case that R in finite, we compute the number of all matrices to solves the matrix equation A^2-rA+sI=0, where I is the identity matrix.
