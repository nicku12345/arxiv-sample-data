In this article, we explore the Riemann zeta function with a perspective on primes and non-trivial zeros. We develop the Golomb's recurrence formula for the nth+1 prime, and assuming (RH), we propose an analytical recurrence formula for the nth+1 non-trivial zero of the Riemann zeta function. Thus all non-trivial zeros up the nth order must be known to generate the nth+1 non-trivial zero. We also explore a variation of the recurrence formulas for primes based on the prime zeta function, which will be a basis for the development of the recurrence formulas for the non-trivial zeros based on the secondary zeta function. In the last part, we review the presented formulas and outline the duality between primes and non-trivial zeros. The proposed formula implies that all primes can be converted into an individual non-trivial zero, and conversely, all non-trivial zeros can be converted into an individual prime. Also, throughout this article, we summarize numerical computation and verify the presented results to high precision.
