Two kinds of invariance for geometrical objects under transformations are involved in this paper. With respect to these kinds, we obtained novel invariants for almost geodesic mappings of the third type of a non-symmetric affine connection space in this paper. Our results are presented in two sections. In the Section 3, we obtained the invariants for the equitorsion almost geodesic mappings which do not have the property of reciprocity.
