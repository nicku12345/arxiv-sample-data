In this paper we establish a new formula for the arithmetic functions that verify  f(n) = \sum_{d|n} g(d) where g is also an arithmetic function. We prove the following identity, \forall n \in \mathbb{N}^*, \ \ \ f(n) = \sum_{k=1}^n \mu \left(\frac{k}{(n,k)}\right) \frac {\varphi(k)}{\varphi\left(\frac{k}{(n,k)}\right)} \sum_{l=1}^{\left\lfloor\frac{n}{k}\right\rfloor} \frac{g(kl)}{kl}  where \varphi and \mu are respectively Euler's and Mobius' functions and (.,.) is the GCD. First, we will compare this expression with other known expressions for arithmetic functions and pinpoint its advantages. Then, we will prove the identity using exponential sums' proprieties. Finally we will present some applications with well known functions such as d and \sigma which are respectively the number of divisors function and the sum of divisors function.
