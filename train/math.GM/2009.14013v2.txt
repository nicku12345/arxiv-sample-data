We study conformal bi-slant submersions from almost Hermitian manifolds onto Riemannian manifolds as a generalized of conformal anti-invariant, conformal semi-invariant, conformal semi-slant, conformal slant and conformal hemi-slant submersions. We investigated the integrability of distributions and obtain necessary and sufficient conditions for the maps to have totally geodesic fibers. Also we studied the total geodesicity of such maps.
