In this paper, we establish Iyengar type inequalities utilizing \psi-Caputo fractional derivatives that is, fractional derivative of a function with respect to another function, which is generalization of some known fractional derivatives such as Riemann-Liouville, Hadamard, Erd\'{e}lyi-Kober. The inequalities in this article are with respect to L_{p} norms, 1\leq p \leq \infty. The tools used in the analysis are based on Taylor's formulae for \psi-Caputo fractional derivatives.
