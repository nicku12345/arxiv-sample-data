New proofs of the classical Hermite-Hadamard inequality are presented and several applications are given, including Hadamard-type inequalities for the functions, whose derivatives have inflection points or whose derivatives are convex. Morever, some estimates from below and above for the first moments of functions % f:[a,b]\rightarrow %TCIMACRO{\U{211d} }% %BeginExpansion \mathbb{R} %EndExpansion  about the center point c=(a+b)/2 are obtained and the reverse Hardy inequality for convex functions f:[0,\infty )\rightarrow (0,\infty ) is established.
