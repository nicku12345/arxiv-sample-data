In this paper, we determine the complex-valued solutions of the functional equation  f(x\sigma(y))+f(\tau(y)x)=2f(x)f(y) for all x,y \in M, where M is a monoid, \sigma: M\longrightarrow M is an involutive automorphism and \tau: M\longrightarrow M is an involutive anti-automorphism. The solutions are expressed in terms of multiplicative functions, and characters of 2-dimensional irreducible representations of M.
