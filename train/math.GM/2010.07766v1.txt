The Goldbach conjecture that, every even integer is the sum of two primes, has been open since 1742. This paper details a road map to a proof of Goldbachs conjecture based on a function that estimates the number of Goldbach pairs. It is shown that the estimate of the number of Goldbach pairs increases as the even integer increases and that the error term is small. Further detailing the functions, assumptions and error term may finally lead to a proof of Goldbachs conjecture.
