The higher derivatives of the tangent and hyperbolic tangent functions are determined. Formulas for the higher derivatives of the inverse tangent and inverse hyperbolic tangent functions as polynomials are stated and proved. Using another formula for the higher derivatives of the inverse tangent function from literature, two known formulas for the Chebyshev polynomials of the first and second kind are proved. From these formulas the higher derivatives of the inverse tangent and inverse hyperbolic tangent functions in terms of the Chebyshev polynomial of the second kind are provided.
