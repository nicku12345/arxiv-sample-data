The concept of the cyclic averages are introduced for a regular polygon P_n and a Platonic solid T_n. It is shown that cyclic averages of equal powers are the same for various P_n(T_n), but their number is characteristic of P_n(T_n). Given the definition of a circle (sphere) by the vertices of P_n(T_n) and on the base of the cyclic averages are established the common metrical relations of P_n(T_n).
