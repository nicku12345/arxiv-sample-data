Through an inversion approach, we suggest a possible estimation for the absolute value of Mertens function \vert M(x) \vert that  \left\vert M(x) \right\vert \sim \left[\frac{1}{\pi \sqrt{\varepsilon}(x+\varepsilon)}\right]\sqrt{x} (where x is an appropriately large real number, and \varepsilon (0<\varepsilon<1) is a small real number which makes 2x+\varepsilon to be an integer). For any large x, we can always find an \varepsilon, so that \vert M(x) \vert < \left[\frac{1}{\pi \sqrt{\varepsilon}(x+\varepsilon)}\right]\sqrt{x}.
