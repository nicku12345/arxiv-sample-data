We propose a notion of iterating functions f:X^{k}\rightarrow X in a way that represents recurrence relations of the form a_{n+k}=f(a_{n},a_{n+1},...,a_{n+k-1}). We define a function as n-involutory when its nth iterate is the identity map, and discuss elementary group-theoretic properties of such functions along with their relation to cycles of their corresponding recurrence relations. Further, it is shown that a function f:X^{k}\rightarrow X that is 2-involutory in each of its k arguments (holding others fixed) is (k+1)-involutory.
