We investigate a class of locally conformal almost K\"ahler structures and prove that, under some conditions, this class is a subclass of almost K\"ahler structures. We show that a locally conformal almost K\"ahler manifold admits a canonical foliation whose leaves are hypersurfaces with mean curvature vector field proportional to the Lee vector field. The geodesibility of the leaves is also characterized, and their minimality coincides with the incompressibility of the Lee vector field along the leaves.
