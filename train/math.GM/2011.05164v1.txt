We study the algebraic structure of the eigenvalues of a Hamiltonian that corresponds to a many-body fermionic system. As the Hamiltonian is quadratic in fermion creation and/or annihilation operators, the system is exactly integrable and the complete single fermion excitation energy spectrum is constructed using the non-interacting fermions that are eigenstates of the quadratic matrix related to the system Hamiltonian. Connection to the Riemann Hypothesis is discussed.
