We define two categories, the category \mathfrak{F}\mathfrak{G} of fuzzy subgroups, and the category \mathfrak{F}\mathfrak{C} of F-inverse covers of inverse monoids, and prove that \mathfrak{F}\mathfrak{G} fully embeds into \mathfrak{F}\mathfrak{C}. This shows that, at least from a categorical viewpoint, fuzzy subgroups belong to the standard mathematics as much as they do to the fuzzy one.
