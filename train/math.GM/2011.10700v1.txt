A set L of straight lines and a set P of points in the Euclidean plane define an arrangement \mathcal{A} = (L, P) of construction lines and registration marks, if and only if: (1) any point in P is a point of intersection of at least two lines in L, and (2) any two nonparallel lines in L have a unique point of intersection in P. This paper discusses the following open problems regarding such arrangements. Suppose k \geq 0 number of points are given in the plane. How many construction lines k points must determine? How many distinct slopes, or directions, are defined by construction lines that k points determine? How many distinct sets of construction lines partition the plane, such that the lines meet at exactly k points? Empirical evidence is reported for small numbers of k, offering partial answers to the three problems. A conjecture is also stated for the first problem, on the number of construction lines, after examining a related problem about finite linear spaces from incidence geometry.
