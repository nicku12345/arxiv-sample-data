The generalized number-theoretic transformation (NPT) is formulated on the basis of the exponential function theorem, which allows us to replace operations modulo the expression as a whole by modulo operations on the exponent of this function, which makes this theorem fundamental for NPT, since it is such a function used in NPT as a weight conversion function. On the basis of this theorem, all the main theorems of the generalized NPT, their duality, as well as the properties of the weight functions of this transformation are formulated and proved. The choice of the basis of this function, as which any number can be chosen, including a complex one, determines not only one or another type of transformation, but also the module of the transformation itself. This allows us to generalize a number of well-known NPTs, such as Mersen, Gauss, and even Fourier, in the form of a unified theory of discrete transformations.
