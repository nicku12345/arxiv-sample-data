The so-called holographic principle, originally addressed to the high energy physics, suggests more generally that the information inseparatly bounded with a physical carrier (measured by its entropy) scales as the event horizon surface---a two-dimensional object. In this paper we present an idea of representing classical information in formalism of pure braid groups, characterized by an exceptionally rich structure for two-dimensional spaces. This leads to some interesting properties, e.g. information geometrization, multi-character alphabets energetic efficiency for information coding characteristic or a group structure decoding scheme. We also proved that proposed pure braid group approach meets all the conditions for storing and processing of information.
