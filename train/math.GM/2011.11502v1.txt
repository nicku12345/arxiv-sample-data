The following material was created with the idea of being used for an introductory fractional calculus course. A recapitulation of the history of fractional calculus is presented, as well as the different attempts at fractional derivatives that existed before current definitions. Properties of the gamma function, beta function and the Mittag-Leffler function are presented, which are fundamental pieces in the fractional calculus. The basic properties of Riemann-Liouville and Caputo fractional derivatives are presented, as well as their implementation to different functions. It also presents the Laplace transform of a fractional operator and an application to the fractional free fall problem.
