In this paper, we introduce the upper and lower approximations on the invers set-valued mapping and the approximations an established on a powerful set valued homomorphism from a ring R1 to power sets of a ring R2. Moreover, the properties of lower and upper approximations of a powerful set valued are studies. In addition, we will give a proof of the theorem of isomorphism over approximations F-rough ring as new result. However, we will prove the kernel of the powerful set-valued homomorphism is a subring of R1. Our result is introduce the first isomorphism theorem of ring as generalized the concept of the set valued mappings.
