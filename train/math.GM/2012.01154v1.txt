An algebraic approximation, of order K, of a polyhedron correlation function (CF) can be obtained from \gamma\pp(r), its chord-length distribution (CLD), considering first, within the subinterval [D_{i-1},\, D_i] of the full range of distances, a polynomial in the two variables (r-D_{i-1})^{1/2} and (D_{i}-r)^{1/2} such that its expansions around r=D_{i-1} and r=D_i simultaneously coincide with left and the right expansions of \gamma\pp(r) around D_{i-1} and D_i up to the terms O\big(r-D_{i-1}\big)^{K/2} and O\big(D_i-r\big)^{K/2}, respectively. Then, for each i, one integrates twice the polynomial and determines the integration constants matching the resulting integrals at the common end points. The 3D Fourier transform of the resulting algebraic CF approximation correctly reproduces, at large qs, the asymptotic behaviour of the exact form factor up to the term O(q^{-(K/2+4)}). For illustration, the procedure is applied to the cube, the tetrahedron and the octahedron.
