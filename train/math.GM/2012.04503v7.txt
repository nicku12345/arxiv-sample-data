For finite Galois extension fields defined by odd degree irreducible polynomials over algebraic integer ring, we observe "Reciprocity Law" through Jacobian Variety by embedding all roots of the polynomials into 2-torsion points of Jacobian Variety. Furthermore, Galois group of the minimal splitting field of such a polynomial is a subgroup of general linear group with coefficient \mathbb{F}_{2}.
