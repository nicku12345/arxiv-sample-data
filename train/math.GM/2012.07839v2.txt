The cluster structures that can be observed in the first few level sets of the Collatz tree are maintained through all its levels, provided that the orbit steadiness \[ \prod_{\substack{k \in R(n)\\ k \equiv 4\ (\mathrm{mod}\ 6)}} \frac{k-1}k \] of the elements n of the Collatz tree is suitably bounded from below, where R(n) denotes the Collatz orbit of n.
