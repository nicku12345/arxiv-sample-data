One of the questions of distribution of prime numbers is considered in the article. It is shown what error is obtained from the assumption that the asymptotic density of a sequence of primes is a probability. Various forms of an analogue of the law of large numbers for arithmetic functions and, in particular, the Hardy-Ramunajan theorem are obtained. A method is given for finding asymptotics of the probabilistic characteristics of arithmetic functions.
