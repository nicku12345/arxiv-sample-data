The aim of this very short note is to relate the directed paths in {\stackrel{\rm \longrightarrow}{\rm \mathbb{R}^n}} to the irreversible paths in {\stackrel{\rm ir}{\rm \mathbb{R}^n}}. We first show that there is a directed path from x to y in {\stackrel{\rm \longrightarrow}{\rm \mathbb{R}^n}} iff there exists an irreversible path with same initial and terminal points in {\stackrel{\rm ir}{\rm \mathbb{R}^n}}. Also, we prove that every directed path in {\stackrel{\rm \longrightarrow}{\rm \mathbb{R}^n}} is an irreversible path in {\stackrel{\rm ir}{\rm \mathbb{R}^n}}.
