In this paper we shall find a new connection between nth degree polynomial mod p congruence with n roots and higher order Fibonacci and Lucas sequences. We shall first discuss about the recent work been done in sequences and their connection to polynomial congruence and then find out new relations between particular recurrence relation and the congruence of the sequences.
