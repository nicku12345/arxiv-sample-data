In this paper we shall give a proof to the Riemann Hypothesis. In this paper we also derive new properties of Mertens function and discuss about a likely upper bound of the absolute value of the Mertens function. Using this likely bound we show that we have a sufficient condition to prove the Riemann Hypothesis.
