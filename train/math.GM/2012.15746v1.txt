There are four division algebras over \mathbb{R}, namely real numbers, complex numbers, quaternions, and octonions. Lack of commutativity and associativity make it difficult to investigate algebraic and geometric properties of octonions. It does not make sense to ask, for example, whether the equation x^2+1=0 is solvable, without specifying the field in which we want the solutions to be lie. The equation x^2+1=0 has no solutions in \mathbb{R}, which is to say, there are no real numbers satisfying this equation. On the other hand, there are complex numbers which do satisfy this equation in the field \mathbb{C} of all complex numbers. How about if we extend the same idea to other two normed division algebras quaternions and octonions. Liping Huang and Wasin So derive explicit formulas for computing the roots of quaternionic quadratic equations. We extend their work to octonionic case and solve monic left octonionic quadratic equation of the form x^2+bx+c=0, where a,b are octonions in general.[ We called this form of quadratic equation as left octonion quadratic equation because we can consider x^2+xb+c=0 as a different case due to non-commutativity of octonions]. Finally, we represent the left spectrum of 2\times2 octonionic matrix as a set of solutions to a corresponding octonionic quadratic equation, which is an application of deriving explicit formulas for computing the roots of octonionic quadratic equations.
