In this paper, a new concept, the fuzzy rate of an operator in linear spaces is proposed for the very first time. Some properties and basic principles of it are studied. Fuzzy rate of an operator B which is specific in a plane is discussed. As its application, a new fixed point existence theorem is proved.
