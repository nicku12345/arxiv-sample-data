The analysis of regularities and randomness in the distribution of prime numbers remains at the research frontiers for many generations of mathematicians from different groups and topical fields. Recently D. Fridman et al. (Am. Math. Mon. 2019, 126:1, 70-73) have suggested the constant f_1 = 2.9200509773... for generation of the complete sequence of primes with using of a recursive relation for f_n such that the floor function \lfloor f_n \rfloor = p_n, where p_n is the nth prime. Here I present the family of constants h_n (h_1 = 1.2148208055...) such that the ceiling function \lceil h_n \rceil = p_n. The proposed recursive relation for h_n generates the complete sequence of prime numbers. I also show that constants h_n are irrational for all n.
