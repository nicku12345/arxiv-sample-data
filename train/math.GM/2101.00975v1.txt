The Erd\H{o}s-Straus conjecture is a renowned problem which describes that for every natural number n~(\ge 2), \frac{4}{n} can be represented as the sum of three unit fractions. The main purpose of this study is to show that the Erd\H{o}s-Straus conjecture is true. The study also re-demonstrates Mordell theorem which states that \frac{4}{n} has a expression as the sum of three unit fractions for every number n except possibly for those primes of the form n\equiv r (mod 780) with r=1^2,11^2,13^2,17^2,19^2,23^2. For l,r,a\in\mathbb{N}; \frac{4}{24l+1}-\frac{1}{6l+r}=\frac{4r-1}{(6l+r)(24l+1)} with 1\le r\le 12l, if at least one of the sums in right side of the expression, say, a+(4r-a-1),~1\le a\le 2r-1 for at least one of the possible value of r such that a,(4r-a-1) divide (6l+r)(24l+1); then the conjecture is valid for the corresponding l. However, in this way the conjecture can not be proved only twelve values of l for l up to l=10^5.
