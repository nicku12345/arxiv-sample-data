A nested coordinate system is a reassigning of independent variables to take advantage of geometric or symmetry properties of a particular application. Polar, cylindrical and spherical coordinate systems are primary examples of such a regrouping that have proved their importance in the separation of variables method for solving partial differential equations. Geometric algebra offers powerful complimentary algebraic tools that are unavailable in other treatments.
