In this paper, we de\"One a new type curve as V-Mannheim curve, V Mannheim partner curve and generating curve of Mannheim curve. We give characterization of these curve. In addition, we study a relation between Mannheim curve and spherical curve. Eventually, with Salkowski method, we give an example of the Mannheim curve.
