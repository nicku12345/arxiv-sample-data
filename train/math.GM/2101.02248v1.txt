Let  x\geq 1  be a large number, let  [x]=x-\{x\}  be the largest integer function, and let  \varphi(n) be the Euler totient function. The result  \sum_{n\leq x}\varphi([x/n])=(6/\pi^2)x\log x+O\left ( x(\log x)^{2/3}(\log\log x)^{1/3}\right )  was proved very recently. This note presents a short elementary proof, and sharpen the error term to  \sum_{n\leq x}\varphi([x/n])=(6/\pi^2)x\log x+O(x) . In addition, the first proofs of the asymptotics formulas for the finite sums  \sum_{n\leq x}\psi([x/n])=(15/\pi^2)x\log x+O(x) , and  \sum_{n\leq x}\sigma([x/n])=(\pi^2/6)x\log x+O(x)  are also evaluated here.
