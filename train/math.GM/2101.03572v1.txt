In this paper we present a direct formula for the solution of the general second order linear ordinary differential equation as our main result such that the parameters required for the formula are determined using another differential equation, which happens to be a Riccati Equation. We also derive other results based on the main result which include special cases for the concerned differential equation with variable coefficients, formula for solution of concerned differential equation with constant coefficients and formula for the solution of the concerned differential equation with one complimentary solution known.
