This research work aims to explore the distortions in distance in equidistant cylindrical projection. The horizontal bending that occurs in the projection process can be assessed by performing a geometric analysis using Tissot's indicatrices. In addition, the concept of the spherical coordinates, alongside with trigonometrical identities, can be used to illustrate the route from a point to another as a curve. With a combination of the knowledge extracted from the examination of the projection using those two theories, this research aims to fully unravel the degree of distortion in distance in equidistant cylindrical projections.
