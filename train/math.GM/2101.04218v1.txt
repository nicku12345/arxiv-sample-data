We define statistical Ces\`{a}ro and statistical logarithmic summability methods of sequences in intuitionistic fuzzy normed spaces(IFNS) and give slowly oscillating type and Hardy type Tauberian conditions under which statistical Ces\`{a}ro summability and statistical logarithmic summability imply convergence in IFNS. Besides, we obtain analogous results for the higher order summability methods as corollaries. Also, two theorems concerning the convergence of statically convergent sequences in IFNS are proved in the paper.
