In this paper, we introduce and study the graph of the groups of mappings on a set X with respect to function compositions that cannot be subsets of the symmetric groups S3 and S4. Furthermore, we investigate some of the justifications on these groups that have studied in graph theory, and we got good results. Moreover, we consider the graph of these groups by fixed points and study some properties of it.
