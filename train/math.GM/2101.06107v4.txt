The \textit{Collatz's conjecture} is an unsolved problem in mathematics. It is named after Lothar Collatz in 1973. The conjecture also known as Syrucuse conjecture or problem.   Take any positive integer  n . If  n  is even then divide it by  2 , else do "triple plus one" and get  3n+1 . The conjecture is that for all numbers, this process converges to one.   In the modular arithmetic notation, define a function  f  as follows: \[f(x)= \left\{ \begin{array}{lll} \frac{n}{2} &if & n\equiv 0 \pmod 2\\ 3n+1& if& n\equiv 1 \pmod 2. \end{array}\right. \] In this paper, we present the proof of the Collatz conjecture for many types of sets defined by the remainder theorem of arithmetic. These sets are defined in mods   6, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, 84, 96, 108 and we took only odd positive remainders to work with. It is not difficult to prove that the same results are true for any mod 12m,  for positive integers m.
