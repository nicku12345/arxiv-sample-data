Brodskiy, Dydak, LaBuz, and Mitra introduced the concepts of uniform joinability and local uniform joinability for uniform spaces when developing their theory of generalized uniform covering maps which was motivated by a paper by Berestovskii and Plaut. (Local) uniform joinability can be thought of as analogous to (local) path connectedness. A chain connected locally uniformly joinable uniform space is uniformly joinable. This note gives an example of a metric space that is uniformly joinable but not locally uniformly joinable.   Plaut recently defined the concept of a weakly chained uniform space. We show that a weakly chained metrizable uniform space is locally uniformly joinable. Since local uniform joinability is equivalent to pointed 1-movability for metric continua, we find that weak chainability is equivalent to pointed 1-movability for such spaces.
