The aim of this paper is to provide a new class of series identities in the form of four general results. The results are established with the help of generalizatons of the classical Kummer's summation theorem obtained earlier by Rakha and Rathie. Results obtained earlier by Srivastava, Bailey and Rathie et al. follow special cases of our main findings.
