Two prominent methods for integer factorization are those based on general integer sieve and elliptic curve. The general integer sieve method can be specialized to quadratic integer sieve method. In this paper, a probability analysis for the success of these methods is described, under some reasonable conditions. The estimates presented are specialized for the elliptic curve factorization. These methods are compared through heuristic estimates. It is shown that the elliptic curve method is a probabilistic polynomial time algorithm under the assumption of uniform probability distribution for the arising group orders and clearly more likely to succeed, faster asymptotically.
