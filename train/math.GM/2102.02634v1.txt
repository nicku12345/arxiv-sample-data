We examine indefinite integral involving of arbitrary power x, multiplied by three spherical Bessel functions of the first kind j_{h},j_{k}, and j_{l} with integer order h,k,l \geq 0 and an exponential. Then we add some conditions for smooth calculation in considering the general and elementary exact evaluation. Thus, by measuring their equivalents, we can verify their accuracy
