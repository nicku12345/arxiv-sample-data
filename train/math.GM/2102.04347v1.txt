In this paper we introduce a new multiple-parameters generalization of the Wright function arose from an eigenvalues problem concerning an hyper-Laguerre-type operator involving Caputo derivatives. We show that by giving particular values at the parameters including in the function, it leads right to well known special functions (the classical Wright function, the \alpha-Mittag-Leffler function, the Tricomi function etc...). In addition, we investigate a nonlinear fractional differential equation admitting the new generalization Wright function as solution, and in particular isochronous solutions.
