In this article, we investigate global norm of potential vector field in Ricci soliton. In particular, we have deduced certain conditions so that the potential vector field has finite global norm in expanding Ricci soliton. We have also showed that if the potential vector field has finite global norm in complete non-compact Ricci soliton having finite volume, then the scalar curvature becomes constant.
