A distance magic labeling of an n-dimensional hypercube is a labeling of its vertices by natural numbers from \{0, \ldots, 2^n-1\}, such that for all vertices v the sum of the labels of the neighbors of v is the same. Such a labeling is called neighbor-balanced, if, moreover, for each vertex v and an index i=0,\ldots,n-1, exactly half of the neighbors of v have digit 1 at i-th position of the binary representation of their label. We demonstrate examples of non-neighbor-balanced distance magic labelings of 6-dimensional hypercube obtained by a SAT solver.
