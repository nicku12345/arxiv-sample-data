Trisecting an angle has been proved to be impossible by Euclidean Geometry, using only straight edge and compass. However, there is a method using Origami (paper folding) procedure to trisect an angle. The algebraic analysis of the same gives us a method of finding trisection using a locus of a point of intersection of two circles. The algebraic analysis and the equation for the locus of the point of intersection of two circles leading to trisection without any measurements is described here. The proof of trisection is exactly same as that of the Origami procedure.
