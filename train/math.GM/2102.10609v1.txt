In this article, for positive integers n\geq m\geq 1, the parameter spaces for the isomorphism classes of the generic point arrangements of cardinality n, and the antipodal point arrangements of cardinality 2n in the Eulidean space \mathbb{R}^m are described using the space of totally nonzero Grassmannian Gr^{tnz}_{mn}(\mathbb{R}). A stratification \mathcal{S}^{tnz}_{mn}(\mathbb{R}) of the totally nonzero Grassmannian Gr^{tnz}_{mn}(\mathbb{R}) is mentioned and the parameter spaces are respectively expressed as quotients of the space \mathcal{S}^{tnz}_{mn}(\mathbb{R}) of strata under suitable actions of the symmetric group S_n and the semidirect product group (\mathbb{R}^*)^n\rtimes S_n. The cardinalities of the space \mathcal{S}^{tnz}_{mn}(\mathbb{R}) of strata and of the parameter spaces S_n\backslash \mathcal{S}^{tnz}_{mn}(\mathbb{R}), ((\mathbb{R}^*)^n\rtimes S_n)\backslash \mathcal{S}^{tnz}_{mn}(\mathbb{R}) are enumerated in dimension m=2. Interestingly enough, the enumerated value of the isomorphism classes of the generic point arrangements in the Euclidean plane is expressed in terms of the number theoretic Euler-totient function. The analogous enumeration questions are still open in higher dimensions for m\geq 3.
