Repeated integration is a major topic of multivariable calculus. In this article, we study repeated integration. In particular, we study repeated integrals and recurrent integrals. For each of these integrals, we develop reduction formulae for both the definite as well as indefinite form. These reduction formulae express these repetitive integrals in terms of single integrals. We also derive a generalization of the fundamental theorem of calculus that expresses a definite integral in terms of an indefinite integral for repeated and recurrent integrals. From the recurrent integral formulae, we derive some partition identities. Then we provide an explicit formula for the n-th integral of x^m(\ln x)^{m'} in terms of a shifted multiple harmonic star sum. Additionally, we use this integral to derive new expressions for the harmonic sum and repeated harmonic sum.
