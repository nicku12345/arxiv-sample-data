In this paper, we solve the Navier-Stokes equation, one of the seven Millennium Prize Problems suggested by Clay Mathematics Institute(CMI). We prove that, for any initial velocity u0, there has been a force vector f, such that there exists no smooth solution to the respective Navier-Stokes equation. This result also holds for the Euler equation. For any n>=1, similar results also hold for n dimensional Navier-Stokes equation or Euler equation.
