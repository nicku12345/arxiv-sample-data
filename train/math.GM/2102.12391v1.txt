Binomial coefficients have been used for centuries in a variety of fields and have accumulated numerous definitions. In this paper, we introduce a new way of defining binomial coefficients as repeated sums of ones. A multitude of binomial coefficient identities will be shown in order to prove this definition. Using this new definition, we simplify some particular sums such as the repeated Harmonic sum and the repeated Binomial-Harmonic sum. We derive formulae for simplifying general repeated sums as well as a variant containing binomial coefficients. Additionally, we study the m-th difference of a sequence and show how sequences whose m-th difference is constant can be related to binomial coefficients.
