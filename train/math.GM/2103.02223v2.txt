This paper discloses a proof for the Riemann Hypothesis. On iterative expansion of the integration term in functional equation of Riemann zeta function we get a series. At the `non-trivial' zeros of zeta function, value of the series is zero. Thus, Riemann hypothesis is false if that happens for an `s' off the critical line\left(\Re(s)=1/2\right). This series has two components. These components are such that if one component is defined as f(s) the other equals f(1-s). For the hypothesis to be false either both these components are individually zero or one component is the additive inverse of other. From geometric analysis of component series function f(s) we find that f(s) \neq 0 anywhere in the critical strip. Further, using the additive properties of odd functions we prove by contradiction that they cannot be each other's additive inverse for any s, off the critical line. Thus, proving truth of the hypothesis.
