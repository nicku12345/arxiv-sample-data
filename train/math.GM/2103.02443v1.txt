We propose to associate to a modular form (an infinite number of) complex valued functions on the p-adic numbers \mathbb{Q}_p for each prime p. We elaborate on the correspondence and study its consequence in terms of the Mellin transforms and the L-functions related to the forms. Further we discuss the case of products of Dirichlet L-functions and their Mellin duals, which are convolution products of \vartheta-series. The latter are intriguingly similar to non-holomorphic Maass forms of weight zero as suggested by their Fourier coefficients.
