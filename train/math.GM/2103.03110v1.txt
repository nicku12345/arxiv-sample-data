In this manuscript, the authors derive closed formula for definite integrals of combinations of logarithmic functions of complicated arguments and powers and express these integrals in terms of the Hurwitz zeta. These derivations are then expressed in terms of fundamental constants, elementary and special functions. A summary of the results is produced in the form of a table of definite integrals for easy referencing by readers.
