Let u\ne \pm 1, and v\ne \pm 1 be a pair of fixed relatively prime squarefree integers, and let d\geq 1, and e \geq1 be a pair of fixed integers. It is shown that there are infinitely many primes p\geq 2 such that u and v have simultaneous prescribed multiplicative orders \text{ord}_pu=(p-1)/d and \text{ord}_pv=(p-1)/e respectively, unconditionally. In particular, a squarefree odd integer u>2 and v=2 are simultaneous primitive roots and quadratic residues (or quadratic nonresidues) modulo p for infinitely many primes p, unconditionally.
