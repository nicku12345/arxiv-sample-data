The recently developed proof of Fermat's Last Theorem is very lengthy and difficult, so much so as to be beyond all but a small body of specialists. While certainly of value in the developments that resulted, that proof could not be, nor was offered as being, possibly the proof Fermat had in mind. The present proof being brief, direct and concise is a candidate for being what Fermat had in mind. It is also completely accessible to any one trained in common algebra. That critical suggestions offered by significant mathematics authorities have been unable to invalidate this concise and direct proof would tend to be major confirmation that: The proof stands, valid and not validly challenged.
