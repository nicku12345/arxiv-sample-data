As of the date of this version, this monograph (parts I and II) contains all of the known technical results relative to the Robinson-styled nonstandard modeling of natural languages and certain associated linguistic processes such as deduction via consequence operators among other concepts. These results have direct application to the construction of the GGU-model, the GID-model, the GD-model, the MA-model and also apply to philosophy, psychology, properton theory and other aspects of the Nonstandard Physical World (NSP-world).
