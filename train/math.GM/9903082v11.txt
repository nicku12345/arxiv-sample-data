As of this date of this version, this monograph (part I and II) contains most of the technical results relative to the Robinson-styled nonstandard modeling of natural languages and certain associated linguistic processes such as deduction via consequence operators among other concepts. These results have direct application to the construction of the GGU-model, GID-model, D-world model, MA-model and also apply to philosophy, psychology, properton theory and other aspects of the Nonstandard Physical World (NSP-world).
