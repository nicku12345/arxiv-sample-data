The interactive game theoretical approach to tactics and behavioral self-organization is developed. Though it uses the interactive game theoretical formalization of dialogues as psycholinguistic phenomena, the crucial role is played by the essentially new concept of a tactical game. Applications to the perception processes and related subjects (memory, recollection, image understanding, imagination) are discussed together with relations to the computer vision and pattern recognition (the dynamical formation of patterns and perception models during perception as a result of its self-organization) and computer games (modelling of the tactical behavior and self-organization, tactical RPG and elaboration of new tactical game techniques). The appendix is devoted to the operative computer games and the user programming of operative units in a multi-user online operative computer game.
