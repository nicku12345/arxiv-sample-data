Earlier an arbitrary poset P was proved to be isomorphic to the collection of subsets of a space M with two closures which are closed in the first closure and open in the other. As a space M for this representation an algebraic dual space P^* was used. Here we extend the theory of algabraic duality for posets generalizing the notion of an ideal. This approach yields a sufficient condition for the collection of clopen subsets of a subset of P^* (with respect to induced closures) to be isomorphic to P. Applying this result to certain classes of posets we prove some representation theorems and get a topological characterization of orthocomplementations.
