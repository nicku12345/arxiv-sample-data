Steprans provided a characterization of betaN\N in the aleph_2-Cohen model that is much in the spirit of Parovicenko's characterization of this space under CH. A variety of the topological results established in the Cohen model can be deduced directly from the properties of betaN\N or P(N)/fin that feature in Steprans' result.
