Let f:X -> Y be an onto map between compact spaces such that all point-inverses of f are zero-dimensional. Let A be the set of all functions u:X -> I=[0,1] such that u[f^\leftarrow(y)] is zero-dimensional for all y in Y. Do almost all maps u:X -> I, in the sense of Baire category, belong to A? H. Toru\'nczyk proved that the answer is yes if Y is countable-dimensional. We extend this result to the case when Y has property C.
