We study 3-valent maps M_n(p,q) consisting of a ring of n q-gons whose the inner and outer domains are filled by p-gons, for p,q \ge 3. We describe a domain in the space of parameters p, q, and n, for which such a map may exist. With four infinite sequences of maps - prisms M_p(p \ge 3,4), M_4(4,q \ge 4), M_4(5,5t+2 \ge 7), M_4(5,5t+3 \ge 8), we give 20 sporadic ones. The maps whose p-gons form two paths are first two infinite sequences and 5 maps: M_{28}(7,5), M_{12}(6,5), M_{10}(5,6), M_{20}(5,7), M_{2}(3,6)
