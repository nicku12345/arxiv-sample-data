For every topological group G one can define the universal minimal compact G-space X=M_G characterized by the following properties: (1) X has no proper closed G-invariant subsets; (2) for every compact G-space Y there exists a G-map X-->Y. If G is the group of all orientation-preserving homeomorphisms of the circle S^1, then M_G can be identified with S^1 (V. Pestov). We show that the circle cannot be replaced by the Hilbert cube or a compact manifold of dimension >1. This answers a question of V. Pestov. Moreover, we prove that for every topological group G the action of G on M_G is not 3-transitive.
