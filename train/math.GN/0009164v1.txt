Theorem converse to Jordan's curve theorem says that {\it if a compact set K has two complementary domains in R^{2}, from each of which it is at every point accessible, it is a simple closed curve}.   We show that the requirement of this theorem that {\it all} points of K were accessible from {\it both} complementary domains is surplus and prove one generalization of this theorem.
