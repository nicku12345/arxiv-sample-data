Suppose M is a noncompact connected PL 2-manifold. In this paper we study the topological property of the triple (H(M)_0, H^PL(M)_0, H^PL, c(M)_0), where H(M)_0 is the identity component of the homeomorphism group {\cal H}(M) of M with the compact-open topology, and H^PL(M)_0 and H^PL, c(M)_0 are the identity components of the subgroups consisting of PL-homeomorphisms of M and ones with compact supports. We show that this triple is a (s^infty,sigma^infty,sigma^infty_f)-manifold and determine its topological type. We also study the subgroups of Lipschitz homeomorphisms.
