An action of a group G on a compact space X is called weakly almost periodic if the orbit of every continuous function on X is weakly relatively compact in C(X). We observe that for a topological group G the following are equivalent: (i) every continuous action of G on a compact space is weakly almost periodic; (ii) G is precompact. For monothetic groups the result was previously obtained by Akin and Glasner, while for locally compact groups it has been known for a long time.
