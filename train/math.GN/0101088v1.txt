A duality of \kappa-normed topological vector spaces is defined and investigated. For such spaces the analog of the Mackey-Arens theorem is proved. There are investigated cases, when \kappa-normability of a topological vector space implies its local convexity. There are given applications of \kappa -normed spaces for resolutions of differential equations and for approximations of functions in mathematical economy.
