Let L be a countable CW-complex and F\colon X\to Y be upper semicontinuous UV^{[L]}-valued mapping of a paracompact space X to a complete metric space Y. We prove that if X is a C-space of extension dimension \ed X \le [L], then F admits single-valued graph approximations. For L=S^n our result implies well-known approximation theorem for UV^{n-1}-valued mappings of n-dimensional spaces. And for L=\{\rm point\} our theorem implies a theorem of Ancel on approximations of UV^\infty-valued mappings of C-spaces.
