The linear isometries between weighted Banach spaces of continuous functions are considered. Some of well known theorems on isometries between spaces of continuous functions are proved and stated, but all they are in an appropriate form. In this paper, we present some new results, too, and results that extend some of our PhD(1993year) disertation theorems. We hope this letter will be useful for obtaining some email friendships.
