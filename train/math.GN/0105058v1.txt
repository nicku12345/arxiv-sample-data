The notion of movability for metrizable compacts was introduced by K.Borsuk [1]. In this paper we define the notion of movable category and prove that the movability of a topological space X coincides with the movability of a suitable category, which is generated by the topological space X (i.e., the category W^X, defined by S.Mardesic).
