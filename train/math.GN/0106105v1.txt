We investigate some properties of topological groups related to disconnectedness or Archimedeanness. We prove or disprove the preservation of those under operations as subgroups, quotients, products, etc. Characterizations of non-Archimedeanness are obtained by using embedding into universal groups. We also clarify the differences between the properties by constructing miscellaneous Polish groups.
