We consider a nonlinear counterpart of a compactness lemma of J. Simon, which arises naturally in the study of doubly nonlinear equations of elliptic-parabolic type. Our work was motivated by previous results J. Simon, recently sharpened by H. Amann, in the linear setting, and by a nonlinear compactness argument of H.W. Alt and S. Luckhaus.
