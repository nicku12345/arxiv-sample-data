In this paper we give new proofs of the theorem of Ma\'{c}kowiak and Tymchatyn that every metric continuum is a weakly-confluent image of some one-dimensional hereditarily indecomposable continuum of countable weight. The first is a model-theoretic argument; the second is a topological proof inspired by the first.
