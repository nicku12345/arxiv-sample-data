A characterization of n-dimensional spaces via continuous selections avoiding Z_n-sets is given, and a selection theorem for strongly countable-dimensional spaces is established. We apply these results to prove a generalized Ostrand's theorem and to obtain a new alternative proof of the Hurewicz formula.
