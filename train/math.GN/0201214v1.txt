It is proved that if X is a compact Hausdorff space of Lebesgue dimension \dim(X), then the squaring mapping \alpha_{m} \colon (C(X)_{\mathrm{sa}})^{m} \to C(X)_{+}, defined by \alpha_{m}(f_{1},..., f_{m}) = \sum_{i=1}^{m} f_{i}^{2}, is open if and only if m -1 \ge \dim(X). Hence the Lebesgue dimension of X can be detected from openness of the squaring maps \alpha_m. In the case m=1 it is proved that the map x \mapsto x^2, from the self-adjoint elements of a unital C^{\ast}-algebra A into its positive elements, is open if and only if A is isomorphic to C(X) for some compact Hausdorff space X with \dim(X)=0.
