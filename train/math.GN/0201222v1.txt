Let X,Y be topological vector spaces or metric spaces, and let {f:X\times Y \to \Re } be a real function lower semicontinuous in the first variable and upper semicontinuous in the second one. It is proved that f is globally measurable. Sierpinski (1925) has been raised this question in the case X=Y=\Re . This particular case was solved by Kempisty (1929). The actual result has applications in Calculus of Variations.
