Solenoids are inverse limit spaces over regular covering maps of closed manifolds. M.C. McCord has shown that solenoids are topologically homogeneous and that they are principal bundles with a profinite structure group. We show that if a solenoid is bihomogeneous, then its structure group contains an open abelian subgroup. This leads to new examples of homogeneous continua that are not bihomogeneous.
