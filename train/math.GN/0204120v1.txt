We comment van Douwen's problems on the Bohr topology of the abelian groups raised in his paper (The maximal totally bounded group topology on G and the biggest minimal G-space for Abelian groups G) as well as the steps in the solution of some of them. New solutions to two of the resolved problems are also given.
