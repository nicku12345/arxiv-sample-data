A base \mathcal{B} for a space X is said to be sharp if, whenever x\in X and (B_n)_{n\in\omega} is a sequence of pairwise distinct elements of \mathcal{B} each containing x, the collection \{\bigcap_{j\le n}B_j:n\in\omega\} is a local base at x. We answer questions raised by Alleche et al. and Arhangel'ski\u{\i} et al. by showing that a pseudocompact Tychonoff space with a sharp base need not be metrizable and that the product of a space with a sharp base and [0,1] need not have a sharp base. We prove various metrization theorems and provide a characterization along the lines of Ponomarev's for point countable bases.
