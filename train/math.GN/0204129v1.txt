The present paper improves a result of V. Gutev and T. Nogura (1999) showing that a space X is topologically well-orderable if and only if there exists a selection for \mathcal{F}_2(X) which is continuous with respect to the Fell topology on \mathcal{F}_2(X). In particular, this implies that \mathcal{F}(X) has a Fell-continuous selection if and only if \mathcal{F}_2(X) has a Fell-continuous selection.
