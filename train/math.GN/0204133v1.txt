In the paper we investigate Borel classes of multivalued functions of two variables. In particular we generalize a result of Marczewski and Ryll-Nardzewski concerning of real function whose ones of its sections are right-continuous and other ones are of Borel class \alpha, into the case of multivalued functions.
