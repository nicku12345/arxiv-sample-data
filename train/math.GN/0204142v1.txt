Given a cover \mathcal{B} of a quasi-uniform space Y we introduce a concept of lower semicontinuity for multifunctions F:X\to 2^Y, called \mathcal{B}-lsc. In this way, we get a common description of Vietoris-lsc, Hausdorff-lsc, and bounded-Hausdorff-lsc as well. Further, we examine set-theoretical and vector operations on such multifunctions. We also point out that the convex hull of Hausdorff-lsc multifunctions need not to be Hausdorff-lsc except the case where the range space is locally convex.
