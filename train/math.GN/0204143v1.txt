We prove that, for every cardinal number \alpha\geq {\mathfrak c}, there exists a metrizable space X with |X|=\alpha such that for every pair of quasiorders \leq_1, \leq_2 on a set Q with |Q| \leq \alpha satisfying the implication q \leq_1 q' \implies q \leq_2 q' there exists a system \{X(q) : q\in Q\} of non-homeomorphic clopen subsets of X with the following properties: (1) q \leq_1 q' if and only if X(q) is homeomorphic to a clopen subset of X(q'), (2) q \leq_2 q' implies that X(q) is homeomorphic to a closed subset of X(q') and (3) \neg (q \leq_2 q') implies that there is no one-to-one continuous map of X(q) into X(q').
