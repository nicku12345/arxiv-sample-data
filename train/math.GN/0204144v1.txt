Every topological group G has some natural compactifications which can be a useful tool of studying G. We discuss the following constructions: (1) the greatest ambit S(G) is the compactification corresponding to the algebra of all right uniformly continuous bounded functions on G; (2) the Roelcke compactification R(G) corresponds to the algebra of functions which are both left and right uniformly continuous; (3) the weakly almost periodic compactification W(G) is the envelopping compact semitopological semigroup of G (`semitopological' means that the multiplication is separately continuous). The universal minimal compact G-space X=M_G is characterized by the following properties: (1) X has no proper closed G-invariant subsets; (2) for every compact G-space Y there exists a G-map X\to Y. A group G is extremely amenable, or has the fixed point on compacta property, if M_G is a singleton. We discuss some results and questions by V. Pestov and E. Glasner on extremely amenable groups. The Roelcke compactifications were used by M. Megrelishvili to prove that W(G) can be a singleton. They can be used to prove that certain groups are minimal. A topological group is minimal if it does not admit a strictly coarser Hausdorff group topology.
