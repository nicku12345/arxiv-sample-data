Throughout this Abstract, G is a topological Abelian group and \hat{G} is the space of continuous homomorphisms from G into T in the compact-open topology. A dense subgroup D of G determines G if the (necessarily continuous) surjective isomorphism \hat{G} \twoheadrightarrow \hat{D} given by h\mapsto h|D is a homeomorphism, and G is determined if each dense subgroup of G determines G. The principal result in this area, obtained independently by L. Aussenhofer and M. J. Chasco}, is the following: Every metrizable group is determined. The authors offer several related results, including these. (1) There are (many) nonmetrizable, noncompact, determined groups. (2) If the dense subgroup D_i determines G_i with G_i compact, then \oplus_i D_i determines \Pi_i G_i. In particular, if each G_i is compact then \oplus_i G_i determines \Pi_i G_i. (3) Let G be a locally bounded group and let G^+ denote G with its Bohr topology. Then G is determined if and only if {G^+} is determined. (4) Let non(N) be the least cardinal \kappa such that some X \subseteq T} of cardinality \kappa has positive outer measure. No compact G with w(G)\geq non(N) is determined; thus if non(N)=\aleph_1 (in particular if CH holds), an infinite compact group G is determined if and only if w(G)=\omega. Question. Is there in ZFC a cardinal \kappa such that a compact group G is determined if and only if w(G)<\kappa? Is \kappa=non(N)? \kappa=\aleph_1?
