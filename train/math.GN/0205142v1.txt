We introduce the notion of weakly (strongly) infinite real rank for unital C^{\ast}-algebras. It is shown that a compact space X is weakly (strongly) infine-dimensional if and only if C(X) has weakly (strongly) infinite real rank. Some other properties of this concept are also investigated. In particular, we show that the group C^{\ast}-algebra C^{\ast}({\mathbb F}_{\infty}) of the free group on countable number of generators has strongly infinite real rank.
