We prove that for every compactum X and every integer n \geq 2 there are a compactum Z of \dim \leq n and a surjective UV^{n-1}-map r: Z \lo X having the property that: for every finitely generated abelian group G and every integer k \geq 2 such that \dim_G X \leq k \leq n we have \dim_G Z \leq k and r is G-acyclic, or equivalently: for every simply connected CW-complex K with finitely generated homotopy groups such that \edim X \leq K we have \edim Z \leq K and r is K-acyclic. (A space is K-acyclic if every map from the space to K is null-homotopic. A map is K-acyclic if every fiber is K-acyclic.)
