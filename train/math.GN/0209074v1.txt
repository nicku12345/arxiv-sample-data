Let f\colon X\to Y be a perfect surjective map of metrizable spaces. It is shown that if Y is a C-space (resp., \dim Y\leq n and \dim f\leq m), then the function space C(X,\uin^{\infty}) (resp., C(X,\uin^{2n+1+m})) equipped with the source limitation topology contains a dense G_{\delta}-set \mathcal{H} such that f\times g embeds X into Y\times\uin^{\infty} (resp., into Y\times\uin^{2n+1+m}) for every g\in\mathcal{H}. Some applications of this result are also given.
