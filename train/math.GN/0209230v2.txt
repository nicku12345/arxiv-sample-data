Let f\colon X\to Y be a \sigma-perfect k-dimensional surjective map of metrizable spaces such that \dim Y\leq m. It is shown that, for every positive integer p\geq 1 there exists a dense G_{\delta}-subset {\mathcal H}(k,m,p) of C(X,\uin^{k+p}) with the source limitation topology such that if g\in{\mathcal H}(k,m,p), then each fiber of f\triangle g contains at most \max\{m+k-p+2,1\} points.This result provides a proof of two hypotheses of S. Bogatyi, V. Fedorchuk and J. van Mill.
