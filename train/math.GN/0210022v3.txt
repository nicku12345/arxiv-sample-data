A stratified pseudomanifold is normal if its links are connected. A normalization of a stratified pseudomanifold X is a normal stratified pseudomanifold Y together with a finite-to-one projection n:Y\to X satisfying a local condition related to the fibers. The map n preserves the intersection homology. Following Borel any pl-stratified pseudomanifod has a normalization in the above sense. In this parper: 1.- We prove that the map n can be required to satisfy a stronger condition: it is a locally trivial stratified morphism preserving the conical structure transverse to the strata. 2.- We extend Borel's result for any topological stratified pseudomanifold and for a family of perversities which is larger than the usual one. 3.- We make an explicit construction of such a normalization. We give a detailed description of the normalizer's stratification. 4.- We prove that our construction is functorial, thus unique up to isomorphisms. With little adjust our procedure holds also in the C^{\infty} category.
