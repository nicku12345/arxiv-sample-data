THEOREM. For every prime p and each n=2, 3, ... \infty, there is an action of G=\prod_{i=1}^{\infty}(Z/ pZ) on a two-dimensional compact metric space X with n-dimensional orbit space.   This theorem was proved in [DW: A.N. Dranishnikov and J.E. West, Compact group actions that raise dimension to infinity, Topology and its Applications 80 (1997), 101-114] with an error in one of the lemmas (Lemma 15). This paper presents a corrected version of Lemma 15 and it is identical with [DW] in the rest.
