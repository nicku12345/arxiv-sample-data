This is the first issue of a semi-formal bulletin dealing with Selection Principles in Mathematics (SPM) -- this field deals with all sorts of studies of diagonalization arguments, especially in topology (covering properties, sequences of covers, etc.) and infinite combinatorics (cardinal characteristics of the continuum), and their applications to other areas of mathematics (function spaces, game theory, group theory, etc.)
