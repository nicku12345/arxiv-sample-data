We introduce a new technique for proving the classical Stable Manifold theorem for hyperbolic fixed points. This method is much more geometrical than the standard approaches which rely on abstract fixed point theorems. It is based on the convergence of a canonical sequence of ``finite time local stable manifolds'' which are related to the dynamics of a finite number of iterations.
