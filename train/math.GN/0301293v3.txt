Let f\colon X\to Y be a perfect map between finite-dimensional metrizable spaces and p\geq 1. It is shown that the space C^*(X,\R^p) of all bounded maps from X into \R^p with the source limitation topology contains a dense G_{\delta}-subset consisting of f-regularly branched maps. Here, a map g\colon X\to\R^p is f-regularly branched if, for every n\geq 1, the dimension of the set \{z\in Y\times\R^p: |(f\times g)^{-1}(z)|\geq n\} is \leq n\cdot\big(\dim f+\dim Y\big)-(n-1)\cdot\big(p+\dim Y\big). This is a parametric version of the Hurewicz theorem on regularly branched maps.
