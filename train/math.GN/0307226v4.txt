We describe a simple machinery which translates results on algebraic sums of sets of reals into the corresponding results on their cartesian product. Some consequences are:   1. The product of a meager/null-additive set and a strong measure zero/strongly meager set in the Cantor space has strong measure zero/is strongly meager, respectively.   2. Using Scheepers' notation for selection principles: Sfin(Omega,Omega^gp)\cap S1(O,O)=S1(Omega,Omega^gp), and Borel's Conjecture for S1(Omega,Omega) (or just S1(Omega,Omega^gp)) implies Borel's Conjecture.   These results extend results of Scheepers and Miller, respectively.
