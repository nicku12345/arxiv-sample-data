Let U be a simply connected domain on the Riemann sphere whose complement K contains more than one point. We establish a characterization of local connectivity of K at a point in terms of the prime ends whose impressions contain this point. Invoking a result of Ursell and Young, we obtain an alternative proof of a theorem of Torhorst, which states that the impression of a prime end of U contains at most two points at which K is locally connected.
