We construct majorant functions \Phi (t,z) for the Mayer series of pressure satisfying a nonlinear differential equation of first order which can be solved by the method of characteristics. The domain | z| <(e\tau) ^{-1} of convergence of Mayer series is given by the envelop of characteristic intersections. For non negative potentials we derive an explicit solution in terms of the Lambert W --function which is related to the exponential generating function T of rooted trees as T(x)=-W(-x). For stable potentials the solution is majorized by a non negative potential solution. There are many choices in this case and we combine this freedom together with a Lagrange multiplier to examine the Yukawa gas in the region of collapse. We give, in this paper, a sufficient condition to establish a conjecture of Benfatto, Gallavotti and Nicol\'{o}. For any \beta \in \lbrack 4\pi, 8\pi), the Mayer series with the leading terms of the expansion omitted (how many depending on \beta ) is shown to be convergent provided an improved stability condition holds. Numerical calculations presented indicate this condition is satisfied if few particles are involved.
