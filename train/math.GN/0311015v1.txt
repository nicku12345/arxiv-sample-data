A compact space K is {\em Valdivia compact} if it can be embedded in a Tikhonov cube I^A in such a way that the intersection K\cap\Sigma is dense in K, where \Sigma is the sigma-product (= the set of points with countably many non-zero coordinates). We show that there exists a compact connected Abelian group of weight \o_1 which is not Valdivia compact, and deduce that Valdivia compact spaces are not preserved by open maps.
