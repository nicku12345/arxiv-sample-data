For any abelian compact Lie group G, we introduce a family of G-stratified pseudomanifolds, whose main feature is the preservation of the orbit spaces in the category of stratified pseudomanifolds. Which generalize a previous definition given by R. Popper. We also find a sufficient condition for the existence of equivariant unfoldings, so we have Intersection Cohomology with differential forms, as defined in \cite{S}. Moreover, if G act on a manifold M, we find a equivariant unfolding of M which induces a canonical unfolding on the k-orbits space for every closed subgroup K of G.
