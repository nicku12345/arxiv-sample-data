In this work we first give for PN spaces results parallel to those obtained by Egbert for the product of PM spaces, and generalize results by Alsina and Schweizer in order to study non-trivial products and the product of m-- transforms of several PN spaces.   In addition we present a detailed study of \alpha--simple product PN spaces and, finally, the product topologies in PN spaces which are products of countable families of PN spaces.
