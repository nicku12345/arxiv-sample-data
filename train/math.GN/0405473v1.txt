For X a separable metric space define \pp(X) to be the smallest cardinality of a subset Z of X which is not a relative \ga-set in X, i.e., there exists an \om-cover of X with no \ga-subcover of Z. We give a characterization of \pp(2^\om) and \pp(\om^\om) in terms of definable free filters on \om which is related to the psuedointersection number \pp. We show that for every uncountable standard analytic space X that either \pp(X)=\pp(2^\om) or \pp(X)=\pp(\om^\om). We show that both of following statements are each relatively consistent with ZFC:   (a) \pp=\pp(\om^\om) < \pp(2^\om) and   (b) \pp < \pp(\om^\om) =\pp(2^\om)
