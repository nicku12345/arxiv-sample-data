We study modules over the ring \widetilde{\C} of complex generalized numbers from a topological point of view, introducing the notions of \widetilde{\C}-linear topology and locally convex \widetilde{\C}-linear topology. In this context particular attention is given to completeness, continuity of \widetilde{\C}-linear maps and elements of duality theory for topological \widetilde{\C}-modules. As main examples we consider various Colombeau algebras of generalized functions
