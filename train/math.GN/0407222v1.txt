We investigate the class of compact spaces which are embeddable into a power of the real line R^\kappa in such a way that c_0(\kappa) is dense in the image. We show that this is a proper subclass of the class of Valdivia, even when restricted to Corson compacta. We prove a preservation result concerning inverse sequences with semi-open retractions. As a corollary we obtain that retracts of Cantor or Tikhonov cubes belong to the above class.
