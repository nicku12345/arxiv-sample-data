It is consistent (relative to ZFC) that the union of max{b,g} many families in the Baire space which are not finitely dominating is not dominating. In particular, it is consistent that for each nonprincipal ultrafilter U, the cofinality of the reduced ultrapower w^w/U is greater than max{b,g}. The model is constructed by oracle chain condition forcing, to which we give a self-contained introduction.
