Relying on Kolmogorov's classical characterization of normable Topological Vector spaces, we study the normability of those Probabilistic Normed Spaces that are also Topological Vector spaces and provide a characterization of normable \v{S}erstnev spaces. We also study the normability of other two classes of Probabilistic Normed Spaces.
