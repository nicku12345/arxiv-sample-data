We solve four out of the six open problems concerning critical cardinalities of topological diagonalization properties involving tau-covers, show that the remaining two cardinals are equal, and give a consistency result concerning this remaining cardinal. Consequently, 21 open problems concerning potential implications between these properties are settled. We also give structural results based on the combinatorial techniques.
