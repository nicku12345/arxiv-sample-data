The property of a normal functor to be open-multicommutative proposed by Kozhan and Zarichnyi (2004) is investigated. A number of normal functors related to the functor of probability measures and equipped with convex structure are considered here and it is proved that the functors cc, ccP, G_{cc}P and \lambda_{cc}P are open-multicommutative.}
