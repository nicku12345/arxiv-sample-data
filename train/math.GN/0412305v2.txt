This issue contains, in addition to the usual contents, a special festive announcement: A book. This book by Banakh and Zdomsky seems to be the first in a planned series by these authors. We believe that the book will become a cornerstone in many future mathematical investigations, in particular in the field of infinite-combinatorial topology. The book's preliminary version is available online, as seen in the announcement, and the readers of the SPM Bulletin are encouraged to take a look and make comments.   Zdomsky has also made two detailed contributions to this issue. This is the ideal form of a contribution to the SPM Bulletin, and we urge all contributors to consider this possibility from time to time.   1 Editor's note; 2 Research announcements; 2.1 On subclasses of weak Asplund spaces; 2.2 The number of translates of a closed nowhere dense set required to cover a Polish group; 2.3 More on convexity numbers of closed sets in R^n; 2.4 A new book: Coherence of Semifilters; 3 Characterization of topological spaces with (strictly) o-bounded free topological group; 4 An equivalent of SPM Bulletin 2's Problem of the month; 5 Boise Extravaganza In Set Theory (March 25--27, 2005); 6 Problem of the Issue; 7 Problems from earlier issues; References
