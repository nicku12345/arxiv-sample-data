This is a survey article on trees, with a modest number of proofs to give a flavor of the way these topologies can be efficiently handled. Trees are defined in set-theorist fashion as partially ordered sets in which the elements below each element are well-ordered. A number of different topologies on trees are treated, some at considerable length. Two sections deal in some depth with the coarse and fine wedge topologies, and the interval topology, respectively. The coarse wedge topology gives a class of supercompact monotone normal topological spaces, and the fine wedge topology puts a monotone normal, hereditarily ultraparacompact topology on every tree. The interval topology gives a large variety of topological properties, some of which depend upon set-theoretic axioms beyond ZFC. Many of the open problems in this area are given in the last section.
