In this paper, we show that D-compactness in Generalized \v{S}erstnev spaces implies D-boundedness and as in the classical case, a D-bounded and closed subset of a characteristic Generalized \v{S}erstnev is not D-compact in general. Finally, in the finite dimensional Generalized \v{S}erstnev spaces a subset is D-compact if and only if is D-bounded and closed.
