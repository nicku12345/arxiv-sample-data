We introduce notions of nearly good relations and N-sticky modulo a relation as tools for proving that spaces are D-spaces. As a corollary to general results about such relations, we show that C_p(X) is hereditarily a D-space whenever X is a Lindel\"of \Sigma-space. This answers a question of Matveev, and improves a result of Buzyakova, who proved the same result for X compact.   We also prove that if a space X is the union of finitely many D-spaces, and has countable extent, then X is linearly Lindel\"of. It follows that if X is in addition countably compact, then X must be compact. We also show that Corson compact spaces are hereditarily D-spaces. These last two results answer recent questions of Arhangel'skii. Finally, we answer a question of van Douwen by showing that a perfectly normal collectionwise-normal non-paracompact space constructed by R. Pol is a D-space.
