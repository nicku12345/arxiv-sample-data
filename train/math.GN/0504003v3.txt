A sequence \{a_n\} in a group G is a {\em T-sequence} if there is a Hausdorff group topology \tau on G such that a_n\stackrel\tau\longrightarrow 0. In this paper, we provide several sufficient conditions for a sequence in an abelian group to be a T-sequence, and investigate special sequences in the Pr\"ufer groups \mathbb{Z}(p^\infty). We show that for p\neq 2, there is a Hausdorff group topology \tau on \mathbb{Z}(p^\infty) that is determined by a T-sequence, which is close to being maximally almost-periodic--in other words, the von Neumann radical \mathbf{n}(\mathbb{Z}(p^\infty),\tau) is a non-trivial finite subgroup. In particular, \mathbf{n}(\mathbf{n}(\mathbb{Z}(p^\infty),\tau)) \subsetneq \mathbf{n}(\mathbb{Z}(p^\infty),\tau). We also prove that the direct sum of any infinite family of finite abelian groups admits a group topology determined by a T-sequence with non-trivial finite von Neumann radical.
