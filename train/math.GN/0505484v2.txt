In this paper we consider probabilistic normed spaces as defined by Alsina, Sklar, and Schweizer, but equipped with non necessarily continuous triangle functions. Such spaces endow a generalized topology that is Fr\'echet-separable, translation-invariant and countably generated by radial and circled 0-neighborhoods. Conversely, we show that such generalized topologies are probabilistically normable.
