The energy of harmonic sections of flat bundles of nonpositively curved (NPC) length spaces over a Riemann surface S is a function E_\rho on Teichm\"uller space \Teich which is a qualitative invariant of the holonomy representation \rho of \pi_1(S). Adapting ideas of Sacks-Uhlenbeck, Schoen-Yau and Tromba, we show that the energy function E_\rho is proper for any convex cocompact representation of the fundamental group. More generally, if \rho is a discrete embedding onto a normal subgroup of a convex cocompact group \Gamma, then E_\rho defines a proper function on the quotient \Teich/Q where Q is the subgroup of the mapping class group defined by \Gamma/\rho(\pi_1(S)). When the image of \rho contains parabolic elements, then E_\rho is not proper. Using the recent solution of Marden's Tameness Conjecture, we show that if \rho is a discrete embedding into \SLtC, then E_\rho is proper if and only if \rho is quasi-Fuchsian. These results are used to prove that the mapping class group acts properly on the subset of convex cocompact representations.
