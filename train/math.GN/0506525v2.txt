We show that a regular cover of a general topological space provides structure similar to a triangulation. In this general setting we define analogues of simplicial maps and prove their existence and uniqueness up to homotopy. As an application we give simple proofs of sharpened versions of nerve theorems of K. Borsuk and A. Weil, which state that the nerve of a regular cover is homotopy equivalent to the underlying space.   Next we prove a nerve theorem for a class of spaces with uniformly bounded extension dimension. In particular we prove that the canonical map from a separable metric n-dimensional space into the nerve of its weakly regular open cover induces isomorphisms on homotopy groups of dimensions less than n.
