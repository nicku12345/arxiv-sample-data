Gromov \cite{Gr_1} and Dranishnikov \cite{Dr_1} introduced asymptotic and coarse dimensions of proper metric spaces via quite different ways. We define coarse and asymptotic dimension of all metric spaces in a unified manner and we investigate relationships between them generalizing results of Dranishnikov \cite{Dr_1} and Dranishnikov-Keesling-Uspienskij   \cite{DKU}.
