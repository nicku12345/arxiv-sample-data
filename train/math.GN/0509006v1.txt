Let X be a Hausdorff compact space and C(X) be the algebra of all continuous complex-valued functions on X, endowed with the supremum norm. We say that C(X) is (approximately) n-th root closed if any function from C(X) is (approximately) equal to the n-th power of another function. We characterize the approximate n-th root closedness of C(X) in terms of n-divisibility of first \check {\rm C}ech cohomology groups of closed subsets of X. Next, for each positive integer m we construct m-dimensional metrizable compactum X such that C(X) is approximately n-th root closed for any n. Also, for each positive integer m we construct m-dimensional compact Hausdorff space X such that C(X) is n-th root closed for any n.
