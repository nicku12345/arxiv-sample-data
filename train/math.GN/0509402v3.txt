We prove that the isometry group \Iso(\Ur) of the universal Urysohn metric space \Ur equipped with the natural Polish topology is a L\'evy group in the sense of Gromov and Milman, that is, admits an approximating chain of compact (in fact, finite) subgroups, exhibiting the phenomenon of concentration of measure. This strengthens an earlier result by Vershik stating that \Iso(\Ur) has a dense locally finite subgroup.
