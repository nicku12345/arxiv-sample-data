We consider special subclasses of the class of Lindel\"of Sigma-spaces obtained by imposing restrictions on the weight of the elements of compact covers that admit countable networks: A space X is in the class L\Sigma(\leq\kappa) if it admits a cover by compact subspaces of weight \kappa and a countable network for the cover. We restrict our attention to \kappa\leq\omega. In the case \kappa=\omega, the class includes the class of metrizably fibered spaces considered by Tkachuk, and the P-approximable spaces considered by Tkacenko. The case \kappa=1 corresponds to the spaces of countable network weight, but even the case \kappa=2 gives rise to a nontrivial class of spaces. The relation of known classes of compact spaces to these classes is considered. It is shown that not every Corson compact of weight \aleph_1 is in the class L\Sigma(\leq \omega), answering a question of Tkachuk. As well, we study whether certain compact spaces in L\Sigma(\leq\omega) have dense metrizable subspaces, partially answering a question of Tkacenko. Other interesting results and examples are obtained, and we conclude the paper with a number of open questions.
