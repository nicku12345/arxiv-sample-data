In this work, topological spaces are enriched by additional structures in order to give a more realistic representation of real life phenomena and computational processes and at the same time, to provide for utilization of the powerful technique developed in topology. The suggested approach is based on the concept of a discontinuity structure or scale Q in a topological space X. This structure serves as a scale for the initial topology on X. Problems of science and engineering need such a scale because all measurements and the majority of computations are performed in a definite scale and problems of scalability are important both for physical theories and computational algorithms. Taking a mapping of a topological space X with the discontinuity structure Q into a topological space Y with a discontinuity structure R, we define (Q,R)-continuity, weak (Q,R)-continuity, and R-continuity of this mapping. Fuzzy continuous functions, which are studied in neoclassical analysis, are examples of R-continuous mappings. Different properties of scales, Q-open, Q-closed sets, and (Q,R)-continuous mappings are obtained.
