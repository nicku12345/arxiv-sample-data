We develop a theory of Nobeling manifolds similar to the theory of Hilbert space manifolds. We show that it reflects the theory of Menger manifolds developed by M. Bestvina and is its counterpart in the realm of complete spaces. In particular, the Nobeling manifold characterization conjecture is proven.
