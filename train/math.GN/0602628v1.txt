We construct a compact linearly ordered space K of weight aleph one, such that the space C(K) is not isomorphic to a Banach space with a projectional resolution of the identity, while on the other hand, K is a continuous image of a Valdivia compact and every separable subspace of C(K) is contained in a 1-complemented separable subspace. This answers two questions due to O. Kalenda and V. Montesinos.
