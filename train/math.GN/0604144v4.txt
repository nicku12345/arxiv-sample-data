We show that for each element g of a Garside group, there exists a positive integer m such that g^m is conjugate to a periodically geodesic element h, an element with |h^n|_\D=|n|\cdot|h|_\D for all integers n, where |g|_\D denotes the shortest word length of g with respect to the set \D of simple elements. We also show that there is a finite-time algorithm that computes, given an element of a Garside group, its stable super summit set.
