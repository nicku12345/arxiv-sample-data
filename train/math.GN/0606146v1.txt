An embeddability criterion for zero-dimensional metrizable topological spaces in zero-dimensional metrizable topological groups is given. A space which can be embedded as a closed subspace in a zero-dimensional metrizable group but is not strongly zero-dimensional is constructed; thereby, an example of a metrizable group with noncoinciding dimensions ind and dim is obtained. It is proved that one of Kulesza's zero-dimensional metrizable spaces cannot be embedded in a metrizable zero-dimensional group.
