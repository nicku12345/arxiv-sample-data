A uniform space is a topological space together with some additional structure which allows one to make sense of uniform properties such as completeness or uniform convergence. Motivated by previous work of J. Rivera-Letelier, we give a new construction of the Berkovich analytic space associated to an affinoid algebra as the completion of a canonical uniform structure on the associated rigid-analytic space.
