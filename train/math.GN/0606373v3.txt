When a topological group G acts on a compact space X, its enveloping semigroup E(X) is the closure of the set of g-translations, g\in G, in the compact space X^X. Assume that X is metrizable. It has recently been shown by the first two authors that the following conditions are equivalent: (1) X is hereditarily almost equicontinuous; (2) X is hereditarily non-sensitive; (3) for any compatible metric d on X the metric d_G(x,y):=\sup\{d(gx,gy): g\in G\} defines a separable topology on X; (4) the dynamical system (G,X) admits a proper representation on an Asplund Banach space. We prove that these conditions are also equivalent to the following: the enveloping semigroup E(X) is metrizable.
