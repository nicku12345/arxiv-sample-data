In this paper we define instanton Floer homology groups for a pair consisting of a compact oriented 3-manifold with boundary and a Lagrangian submanifold of the moduli space of flat SU(2)-connections over the boundary. We carry out the construction for a general class of irreducible, monotone boundary conditions. The main examples of such Lagrangian submanifolds are induced from a disjoint union of handle bodies such that the union of the 3-manifold and the handle bodies is an integral homology 3-sphere. The motivation for introducing these invariants arises from our program for a proof of the Atiyah-Floer conjecture for Heegaard splittings. We expect that our Floer homology groups are isomorphic to the usual Floer homology groups of the closed 3-manifold in our main example and thus can be used as a starting point for an adiabatic limit argument.
