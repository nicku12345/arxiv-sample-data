We construct a path-connected homogenous compactum with cellularity 2^omega that is not homeomorphic to any product of dyadic compacta and first countable compacta. We also prove some closure properties for classes of spaces defined by various connectifiability conditions. One application is that every infinite product of infinite topological sums of T_i spaces has a T_i pathwise connectification, where i is 1, 2, 3, or 3.5.
