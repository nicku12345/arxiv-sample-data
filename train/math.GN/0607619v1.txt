Given a normed cone (X,p) and a subcone Y, we construct and study the quotient normed cone (X/Y,\tilde{p}) generated by Y. In particular we characterize the bicompleteness of (X/Y,\tilde{p}) in terms of the bicompleteness of (X,p), and prove that the dual quotient cone ((X/Y)^{*},\|\cdot \|_{\tilde{p},u}) can be identified as a distinguished subcone of the dual cone (X^{*},\|\cdot \|_{p,u}). Furthermore, some parts of the theory are presented in the general setting of the space CL(X,Y) of all continuous linear mappings from a normed cone (X,p) to a normed cone (Y,q), extending several well-known results related to open continuous linear mappings between normed linear spaces.
