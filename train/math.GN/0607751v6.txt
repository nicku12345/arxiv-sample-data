The fixed point index of topological fixed point theory is a well studied integer-valued algebraic invariant of a mapping which can be characterized by a small set of axioms. The coincidence index is an extension of the concept to topological (Nielsen) coincidence theory. We demonstrate that three natural axioms are sufficient to characterize the coincidence index in the setting of continuous mappings on oriented differentiable manifolds, the most common setting for Nielsen coincidence theory.
