The aim of the present paper is to define compact operators on asymmetric normed spaces and to study some of their properties. The dual of a bounded linear operator is defined and a Schauder type theorem is proved within this framework. The paper contains also a short discussion on various completeness notions for quasi-metric and for quasi-uniform spaces.
