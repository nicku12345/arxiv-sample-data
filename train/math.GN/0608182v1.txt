Let PL_0(I) represent the group of orientation-preserving piecewise-linear homeomorphisms of the unit interval which admit finitely many breaks in slope, under the operation of composition. We find a non-solvable group W and show that W embeds in every non-solvable subgroup of PL_0(I). We find mild conditions under which other non-solvable subgroups (B, (\wr\Z\wr)^{\infty}, (\Z\wr)^{\infty}, and ^{\infty}(\wr\Z)) embed in subgroups of PL_0(I). We show that all solvable subgroups of PL_0(I) embed in all non-solvable subgroups of PL_0(I). These results continue to apply if we replace PL_0(I) by any generalized R. Thompson group F_n.
