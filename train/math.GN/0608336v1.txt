This is an article in mathematics, specifically in set theory. On the example of the Measure Recognition Problem (MRP) the article highlights the phenomenon of the utility of a multidisciplinary mathematical approach to a single mathematical problem, in particular the value of a set-theoretic analysis. MRP asks if for a given Boolean algebra \algB and a property \Phi of measures one can recognize by purely combinatorial means if \algB supports a strictly positive measure with property \Phi. The most famous instance of this problem is MRP(countable additivity), and in the first part of the article we survey the known results on this and some other problems. We show how these results naturally lead to asking about two other specific instances of the problem MRP, namely MRP(nonatomic) and MRP(separable). Then we show how our recent work D\v zamonja and Plebanek (2006) gives an easy solution to the former of these problems, and gives some partial information about the latter. The long term goal of this line of research is to obtain a structure theory of Boolean algebras that support a finitely additive strictly positive measure, along the lines of Maharam theorem which gives such a structure theorem for measure algebras.
