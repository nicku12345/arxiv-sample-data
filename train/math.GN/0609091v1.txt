In a recent paper O. Pavlov proved the following two interesting resolvability results:   (1) If a space X satisfies \Delta(X) > \ps(X) then X is maximally resolvable.   (2) If a T_3-space X satisfies \Delta(X) > \pe(X) then X is \omega-resolvable.   Here \ps(X) (\pe(X)) denotes the smallest successor cardinal such that X has no discrete (closed discrete) subset of that size and \Delta(X) is the smallest cardinality of a non-empty open set in X. In this note we improve (1) by showing that \Delta(X) > \ps(X) can be relaxed to \Delta(X) \ge \ps(X). In particular, if X is a space of countable spread with \Delta(X) > \omega then X is maximally resolvable.   The question if an analogous improvement of (2) is valid remains open, but we present a proof of (2) that is simpler than Pavlov's.
