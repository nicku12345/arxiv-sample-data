We rephrase Gromov's definition of Markov compacta, introduce a subclass of Markov compacta defined by one building block and study cohomological dimensions of these compacta. We show that for a Markov compactum X, \dim_{\Z_{(p)}}X=\dim_{\Q}X for all but finitely many primes p where \Z_{(p)} is the localization of \Z at p. We construct Markov compacta of arbitrarily large dimension having \dim_{\Q}X=1 as well as Markov compacta of arbitrary large rational dimension with \dim_{\Z_p}X=1 for a given p.
