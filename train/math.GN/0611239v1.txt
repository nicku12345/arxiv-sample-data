Given a Lie group G we study the class \M of proper metrizable G-spaces with metrizable orbit spaces, and show that any G-space X \in \M admits a closed G-embedding into a convex G-subset C of some locally convex linear G-space, such that X has some G-neighborhood in C which belongs to the class \M. As corollaries we see that any G-ANE for \M has the G-homotopy type of some G-CW complex and that any G-ANR for \M is a G-ANE for \M.
