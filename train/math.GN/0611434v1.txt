We discuss three families of groups, ZW_n, PL(I^n), and PL(S^n) (the last two being families of groups of piecewise-linear homeomorphisms of standard n-dimensional spaces). We note that for all positive integers n, ZW_n embeds in PL(I^n) which embeds in PL(S^n). In another direction, ZW_2 fails to embed in PL(I^1) by an earlier result of the author, and we extend that result to show that ZW_2 also fails to embed in PL(S^1). The nature of the proofs of these non-embedding results leads us to ask if there are corresponding non-embedding results in higher dimensions.
