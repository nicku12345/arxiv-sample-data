An action of a topological semigroup S on X is compactifiable if this action is a restriction of a jointly continuous action of S on a Hausdorff compact space Y. A topological semigroup S is compactifiable if the left action of S on itself is compactifiable. It is well known that every Hausdorff topological group is compactifiable. This result cannot be extended to the class of Tychonoff topological monoids. At the same time, several natural constructions lead to compactifiable semigroups and actions. We prove that the semigroup C(K,K) of all continuous selfmaps on the Hilbert cube K is a universal second countable compactifiable semigroup (semigroup version of Uspenskij's theorem). Moreover, the Hilbert cube K under the action of C(K,K) is universal in the realm of all compactifiable S-flows X with compactifiable S where both X and S are second countable. We strengthen some related results of Kocak & Strauss and Ferry & Strauss about Samuel compactifications of semigroups. Some results concern compactifications with separately continuous actions, LMC-compactifications and LMC-functions introduced by Mitchell.
