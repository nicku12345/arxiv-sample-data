We answer several questions of V. Tka\v{c}uk from [Point-countable \pi-bases in first countable and similar spaces, Fund. Math. 186 (2005), pp. 55--69.] by showing that   (1) there is a ZFC example of a first countable, 0-dimensional Hausdorff space with no point-countable \pi-base (in fact, the order of any \pi-base of the space is at least \aleph_\omega);   (2) if there is a \kappa-Suslin line then there is a first countable GO space of cardinality \kappa^+ in which the order of any \pi-base is at least \kappa;   (3) it is consistent to have a first countable, hereditarily Lindel\" of regular space having uncountable \pi-weight and \omega_1 as a caliber (of course, such a space cannot have a point-countable \pi-base).
