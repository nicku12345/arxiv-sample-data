We construct an entire function in the Eremenko-Lyubich class \B whose Julia set has only bounded path-components. This answers a question of Eremenko from 1989 in the negative.   On the other hand, we show that for many functions in \B, in particular those of finite order, every escaping point can be connected to \infty by a curve of escaping points. This gives a partial positive answer to the aforementioned question of Eremenko, and answers a question of Fatou from 1926.
