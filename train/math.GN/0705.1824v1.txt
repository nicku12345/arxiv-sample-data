Given a partially ordered set P there exists the most general Boolean algebra F(P) which contains P as a generating set, called the {\it free Boolean algebra} over P. We study free Boolean algebras over posets of the form P=P_0\cup P_1, where P_0,P_1 are well orderings. We call them {\it nearly ordinal algebras}.   Answering a question of Maurice Pouzet, we show that for every uncountable cardinal \kappa there are 2^\kappa pairwise non-isomorphic nearly ordinal algebras of cardinality \kappa.   Topologically, free Boolean algebras over posets correspond to compact 0-dimensional distributive lattices. In this context, we classify all closed sublattices of the product (\omega_1+1)\times(\omega_1+1), thus showing that there are only \aleph_1 many of them. In contrast with the last result, we show that there are 2^{\aleph_1} topological types of closed subsets of the Tikhonov plank (\omega_1+1)\times(\omega+1).
