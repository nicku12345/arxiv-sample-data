The Noetherian type of a space is the least \kappa such that it has a base that is \kappa-like with respect to containment. Just as all known homogeneous compacta have cellularity at most 2^\omega, they satisfy similar upper bounds in terms of Noetherian type and related cardinal functions. We prove these and many other results about these cardinal functions. For example, every homogeneous dyadic compactum has Noetherian type \omega. Assuming GCH, every point in a homogeneous compactum X has a local base that is c(X)-like with respect to containment. If every point in a compactum has a well-quasiordered local base, then some point has a countable local \pi-base.
