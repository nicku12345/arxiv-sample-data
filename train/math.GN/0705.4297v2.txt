Extending some results of Malykhin, we prove several independence results about base properties of \beta\omega-\omega and its powers, especially the Noetherian type Nt(\beta\omega-\omega), the least \kappa for which \beta\omega-\omega has a base that is \kappa-like with respect to containment. For example, Nt(\beta\omega-\omega) is never less than the splitting number, but can consistently be that \omega_1, 2^\omega, (2^\omega)^+, or strictly between \omega_1 and 2^\omega. Nt(\beta\omega-\omega) is also consistently less than the additivity of the meager ideal. Nt(\beta\omega-\omega) is closely related to the existence of special kinds of splitting families.
