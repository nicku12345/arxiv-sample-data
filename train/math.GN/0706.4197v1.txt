In the first part of the work (Sections 2-6) a special attention is given to relative separation axioms and relative connectedness, in particular, many relative versions of p-T_0, p-T_1, p-T_2, (i,j)- and p-regularities, (i,j)- and p-complete regularities, p-real normality and p-normality are discussed. Moreover, relative properties of (i,j)- and p-compactness types, including relative versions of (i,j)- and p-paracompactness, (i,j)- and p-Lindeofness, (i,j)- and p-pseudocompactness are also introduced and investigated. The second part (Sections 7-12) is devoted, on the one hand, to relative bitopological inductive and covering dimension functions and, on the other hand, to relative versions of Baire spaces for both the topological and the bitopological case.   At the end, note that relative (bi)topological properties play a special role not only in the development of respective theories, but also in the strengthening of the previously known results.
