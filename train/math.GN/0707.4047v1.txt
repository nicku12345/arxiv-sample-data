Using the topologist sine curve we present a new functorial construction of cone-like spaces, starting in the category of all path-connected topological spaces with a base point and continuous maps, and ending in the subcategory of all simply connected spaces. If one starts by a noncontractible n-dimensional Peano continuum for any n>0, then our construction yields a simply connected noncontractible (n + 1)-dimensional cell-like Peano continuum. In particular, starting with the circle \mathbb{S}^1, one gets a noncontractible simply connected cell-like 2-dimensional Peano continuum.
