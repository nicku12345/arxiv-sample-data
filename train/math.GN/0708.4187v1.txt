Given a compact set K in the plane, which does not contain any triple of points forming a vertical and a horizontal segment, and a map f\in C(K), we give a construction of functions g,h\in C(\mathbb R) such that f(x,y)=g(x)+h(y) for all (x,y)\in K. This provides a constructive proof of a part of Sternfeld's theorem on basic embeddings in the plane. In our proof the set K is approximated by a finite set of points.
