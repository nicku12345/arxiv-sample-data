The following inequality   \cat X\le \cat Y+\lceil\frac{hd(X)-r}{r+1}\rceil   holds for every locally trivial fibration between ANE spaces f:X\to Y which admits a section and has the r-connected fiber where hd(X) is the homotopical dimension of X. We apply this inequality to prove that   \cat X\le \lceil\frac{\dim X-1}{2}\rceil+cd(\pi_1(X))   for every complex X with cd(\pi_1(X))\le 2.
