There currently exists no algebraic algorithm for computing twisted conjugacy classes in free groups. We propose a new technique for deciding twisted conjugacy relations using nilpotent quotients. Our technique is generalization of the common abelianization method, but admits significantly greater rates of success. We present experimental results demonstrating the efficacy of the technique, and detail how it can be applied the related settings of surface groups and doubly twisted conjugacy.
