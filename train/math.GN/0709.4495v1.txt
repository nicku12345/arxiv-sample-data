Generalizing Duality Theorem of V. V. Fedorchuk, we prove Stone-type duality theorems for the following four categories: all of them have as objects the locally compact Hausdorff spaces, and their morphisms are, respectively, the continuous skeletal maps, the quasi-open perfect maps, the open maps, the open perfect maps. In particular, a Stone-type duality theorem for the category of all compact Hausdorff spaces and all open maps between them is proved. We also obtain equivalence theorems for these four categories. The versions of these theorems for the full subcategories of these categories having as objects all locally compact connected Hausdorff spaces are formulated as well.
