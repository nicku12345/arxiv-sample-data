We prove that there exists a countable family of continuous real functions whose graphs together with their inverses cover an uncountable square, i.e. a set of the form X\times X, where X is an uncountable subset of the real line. This extends Sierpi\'nski's theorem from 1919, saying that S\times S can be covered by countably many graphs of functions and inverses of functions if and only if the size of S does not exceed \aleph_1. Our result is also motivated by Shelah's study of planar Borel sets without perfect rectangles.
