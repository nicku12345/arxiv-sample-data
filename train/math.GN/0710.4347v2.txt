We characterize all compact and Hausdorff spaces X which satisfy that for every multiplicative bijection \phi on C(X, I), there exist a homeomorphism \mu : X \to X and a continuous map p: X \to (0, +\infty) such that \phi (f) (x) = f(\mu (x))^{p(x)} for every f \in C(X,I) and x \in X. This allows us to disprove a conjecture of Marovt (Proc. Amer. Math. Soc. {\bf 134} (2006), 1065-1075). Some related results on other semigroups of functions are also given.
