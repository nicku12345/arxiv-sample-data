In the present paper it is proved that the functors O_\tau of \tau-smooth order preserving functionals and O_R of Radon order preserving functionals preserve the weight of infinite Tychonoff spaces. Moreover, it is established that the density and the weak density of infinite Tychonoff spaces do not increase under these functors.
