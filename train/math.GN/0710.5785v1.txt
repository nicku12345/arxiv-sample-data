A topological group G is {\em extremely amenable} if every compact G-space has a G-fixed point. Let X be compact and G\subset{\mathrm{Homeo}} (X). We prove that the following are equivalent: (1) G is extremely amenable; (2) every minimal closed G-invariant subset of \exp R is a singleton, where R is the closure of the set of all graphs of g\in G in the space \exp (X^2) (\exp stands for the space of closed subsets); (3) for each n=1,2,... there is a closed G-invariant subset Y_n of (\exp X)^n such that \cup_{n=1}^\infty Y_n contains arbitrarily fine covers of X and for every n\ge 1 every minimal closed G-invariant subset of \exp Y_n is a singleton. This yields an alternative proof of Pestov's theorem that the group of all order-preserving self-homeomorphisms of the Cantor middle-third set (or of the interval [0,1]) is extremely amenable.
