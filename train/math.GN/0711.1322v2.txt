We examine the selective screenability property in topological groups. In the metrizable case we also give characterizations in terms of the Haver property and finitary Haver property respectively relative to left-invariant metrics. We prove theorems stating conditions under which the properties are preserved by products. Among metrizable groups we characterize the ones of countable covering dimension by a natural game.
