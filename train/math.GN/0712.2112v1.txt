By a theorem proved by Erdos, Kunen and Mauldin, for any nonempty perfect set P on the real line there exists a perfect set M of Lebesgue measure zero such that P+M=\mathbb{R}. We prove a stronger version of this theorem in which the obtained perfect set M is a Dirichlet set. Using this result we show that for a wide range of familes of subsets of the reals, all additive sets are perfectly meager in transitive sense. We also prove that every proper analytic subgroup G of the reals is contained in an F-sigma set F such that F+G is a meager null set.
