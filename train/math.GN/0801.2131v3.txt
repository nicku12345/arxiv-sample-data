A map f:X\to Y between topological spaces is defined to be {\em scatteredly continuous} if for each subspace A\subset X the restriction f|A has a point of continuity. We show that for a function f:X\to Y from a perfectly paracompact hereditarily Baire Preiss-Simon space X into a regular space Y the scattered continuity of f is equivalent to (i) the weak discontinuity (for each subset A\subset X the set D(f|A) of discontinuity points of f|A is nowhere dense in A), (ii) the \sigma-continuity (X can be written as a countable union of closed subsets on which f is continuous), (iii) the G_\delta-measurability (the preimage of each open set is of type G_\delta).   Also under Martin Axiom, we construct a G_\delta-measurable map f:X\to Y between metrizable separable spaces, which is not piecewise continuous. This answers an old question of V.Vinokurov.
