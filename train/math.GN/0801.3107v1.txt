The class of metrizable spaces M with the following approximation property is introduced and investigated: M\in AP(n,0) if for every \e>0 and a map g\colon\I^n\to M there exists a 0-dimensional map g'\colon\I^n\to M which is \e-homotopic to g. It is shown that this class has very nice properties. For example, if M_i\in AP(n_i,0), i=1,2, then M_1\times M_2\in AP(n_1+n_2,0). Moreover, M\in AP(n,0) if and only if each point of M has a local base of neighborhoods U with U\in AP(n,0). Using the properties of AP(n,0)-spaces, we generalize some results of Levin and Kato-Matsuhashi concerning the existence of residual sets of n-dimensional Lelek maps.
