We define Peano covering maps and prove basic properties analogous to classical covers. Their domain is always locally path-connected but the range may be an arbitrary topological space. One of characterizations of Peano covering maps is via the uniqueness of homotopy lifting property for all locally path-connected spaces.   Regular Peano covering maps over path-connected spaces are shown to be identical with generalized regular covering maps introduced by Fischer and Zastrow. If X is path-connected, then every Peano covering map is equivalent to the projection \widetilde X/H\to X, where H is a subgroup of the fundamental group of X and \widetilde X equipped with the basic topology. The projection \widetilde X/H\to X is a Peano covering map if and only if it has the unique path lifting property. We define a new topology on \widetilde X for which one has a characterization of \widetilde X/H\to X having the unique path lifting property if H is a normal subgroup of \pi_1(X). Namely, H must be closed in \pi_1(X). Such groups include \pi(\mathcal{U},x_0) (\mathcal{U} being an open cover of X) and the kernel of the natural homomorphism from the fundamental group to the Cech fundamental group.
