For a non-compact n-manifold M let H(M) denote the group of homeomorphisms of M endowed with the Whitney topology and H_c(M) the subgroup of H(M) consisting of homeomorphisms with compact support. It is shown that the group H_c(M) is locally contractible and the identity component H_0(M) of H(M) is an open normal subgroup in H_c(M). This induces the topological factorization H_c(M) \approx H_0(M) \times \M_c(M) for the mapping class group \M_c(M) = H_c(M)/H_0(M) with the discrete topology. Furthermore, for any non-compact surface M, the pair (H(M), H_c(M)) is locally homeomorphic to (\square^w l_2,\cbox^w l_2) at the identity id_M of M. Thus the group H_c(M) is an (l_2 \times R^\infty)-manifold. We also study topological properties of the group D(M) of diffeomorphisms of a non-compact smooth n-manifold M endowed with the Whitney C^\infty-topology and the subgroup D_c(M) of D(M) consisting of all diffeomorphisms with compact support. It is shown that the pair (D(M),D_c(M)) is locally homeomorphic to (\square^w l_2, \cbox^w l_2) at the identity id_M of M.   Hence the group D_c(M) is a topological (l_2 \times R^\infty)-manifold for any dimension n.
