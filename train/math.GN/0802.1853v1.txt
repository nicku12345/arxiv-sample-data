Given a group X we study the algebraic structure of its superextension   \lambda(X). This is a right-topological semigroup consisting of all maximal linked systems on X endowed with the operation \mathcal A\circ\mathcal B=\{C\subset X:\{x\in X:x^{-1}C\in\mathcal B\}\in\mathcal A\} that extends the group operation of X. We characterize right zeros of \lambda(X) as invariant maximal linked systems on X and prove that \lambda(X) has a right zero if and only if each element of X has odd order. On the other hand, the semigroup \lambda(X) contains a left zero if and only if it contains a zero if and only if X has odd order |X|\le5. The semigroup \lambda(X) is commutative if and only if |X|\le4. We finish the paper with a complete description of the algebraic structure of the semigroups \lambda(X) for all groups X of cardinality |X|\le5.
