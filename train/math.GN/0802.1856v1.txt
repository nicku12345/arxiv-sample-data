Given a countable group X we study the algebraic structure of its superextension \lambda(X). This is a right-topological semigroup consisting of all maximal linked systems on X endowed with the operation \mathcal A\circ\mathcal B=\{C\subset X:\{x\in X:x^{-1}C\in\mathcal B\}\in\mathcal A\} that extends the group operation of X. We show that the subsemigroup \lambda^\circ(X) of free maximal linked systems contains an open dense subset of right cancelable elements. Also we prove that the topological center of \lambda(X) coincides with the subsemigroup \lambda^\bullet(X) of all maximal linked systems with finite support. This result is applied to show that the algebraic center of \lambda(X) coincides with the algebraic center of X provided X is countably infinite. On the other hand, for finite groups X of order 3\le|X|\le5 the algebraic center of \lambda(X) is strictly larger than the algebraic center of X.
