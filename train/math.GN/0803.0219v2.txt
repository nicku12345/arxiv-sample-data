In this paper we presents further developments regarding the enrichment of the basic Theory of Order Completion. In particular, spaces of generalized functions are constructed that contain generalized solutions to all systems of continuous, nonlinear PDEs. In terms of the existence and uniqueness results previously obtained for such systems of equations, one may interpret the existence of generalized solutions presented here as a regularity result.
