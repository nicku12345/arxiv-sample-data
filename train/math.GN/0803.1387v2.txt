We give a short discussion about a weaker form of minimality (called quasi-minimality). We call a system quasi-minimal if all dense orbits form an open set. It is hard to find examples which are not already minimal. Since elliptic behaviour makes them minimal, these systems are regarded as parabolic systems. Indeed, we show that a quasi-minimal homeomorphism on a manifold is not expansive (hyperbolic).
