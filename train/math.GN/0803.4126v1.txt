We prove that Dranishnikov's k-dimensional resolution d_k\colon \mu^k\to Q is a UV^{n-1}-divider of Chigogidze's k-dimensional resolution c_k. This fact implies that d_k^{-1} preserves Z-sets. A further development of the concept of UV^{n-1}-dividers permits us to find sufficient conditions for d_k^{-1}(A) to be homeomorphic to the N\"{o}beling space \nu^k or the universal pseudoboundary \sigma^k. We also obtain some other applications.
