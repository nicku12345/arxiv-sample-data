Our main result states that the hyperspace of convex compact subsets of a compact convex subset X in a locally convex space is an absolute retract if and only if X is an absolute retract of weight \le\omega_1. It is also proved that the hyperspace of convex compact subsets of the Tychonov cube I^{\omega_1} is homeomorphic to I^{\omega_1}. An analogous result is also proved for the cone over I^{\omega_1}. Our proofs are based on analysis of maps of hyperspaces of compact convex subsets, in particular, selection theorems for such maps are proved.
