We work in set-theory without choice \ZF. Given a closed subset F of [0,1]^I which is a bounded subset of \ell^1(I) ({\em resp.} such that F \subseteq \ell^0(I)), we show that the countable axiom of choice for finite subsets of I, ({\em resp.} the countable axiom of choice \ACD) implies that F is compact. This enhances previous results where \ACD ({\em resp.} the axiom of Dependent Choices \DC) was required. Moreover, if I is linearly orderable (for example I=\IR), the closed unit ball of \ell^2(I) is weakly compact (in \ZF).
