Following James' approach, we shall define the Banach space J(e) for each vector e=(e_1,e_2,...,e_d) \in \Bbb{R}^d with  e_1 \ne 0.   The construction immediately implies that J(1) coincides with the Hilbert space i_2 and that J(1;-1) coincides with the celebrated quasireflexive James space J. The results of this paper show that, up to an isomorphism, there are only the following two possibilities: (i) either J(e) is isomorphic to l_2, if e_1+e_2+...+e_d\ne 0 (ii) or J(e) is isomorphic to J. Such a dichotomy also holds for every separable Orlicz sequence space l_M.
