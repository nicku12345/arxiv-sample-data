We prove that the group D^r(R) of C^r diffeomorphisms of the real line, endowed with the compact-open and Whitney C^r topologies, is bihomeomorphic to the group H(R) of homeomorphisms of the real line endowed with the compact-open and Whitney topologies. This implies that the diffeomorphism group D^r(R) endowed with the Whitney C^r topology is homeomorphic to the countable box-power of the separable Hilbert space.
