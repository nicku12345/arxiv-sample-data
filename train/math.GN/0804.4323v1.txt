We associate at each link a connectivity space which describes its splittability properties. Then, the notion of order for finite connectivity spaces results in the definition of a new numerical invariant for links, their connectivity order. A section of this short paper presents a theorem which asserts that every finite connectivity structure can be realized by a link : the Brunn-Debrunner-Kanenobu Theorem.
