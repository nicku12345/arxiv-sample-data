If f:[a,b]\to \mathbb{R}, with a<b, is continuous and such that a and b are mapped in opposite directions by f, then f has a fixed point in I. Suppose that f:\mathbb{C}\to\mathbb{C} is map and X is a continuum. We extend the above for certain continuous maps of dendrites X\to D, X\subset D and for positively oriented maps f:X\to \mathbb{C}, X\subset \mathbb{C} with the continuum X not necessarily invariant. Then we show that in certain cases a holomorphic map f:\mathbb{C}\to\mathbb{C} must have a fixed point a in a continuum X so that either a\in \mathrm{Int}(X) or f exhibits rotation at a.
