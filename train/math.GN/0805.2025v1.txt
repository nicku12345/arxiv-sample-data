Last years there was increasing an interest to the so called function spaces with non-standard growth, known also as variable exponent Lebesgue spaces. For weighted such spaces on homogeneous spaces, we develop a certain variant of Rubio de Francia's extrapolation theorem. This extrapolation theorem is applied to obtain the boundedness in such spaces of various operators of harmonic analysis, such as maximal and singular operators, potential operators, Fourier multipliers, dominants of partial sums of trigonometric Fourier series and others, in weighted Lebesgue spaces with variable exponent. There are also given their vector-valued analogues.
