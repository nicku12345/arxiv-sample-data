Fedorchuk's fully closed (continuous) maps and resolutions are applied in constructions of non-metrizable higher-dimensional analogues of Anderson, Choquet, and Cook's continua. Certain theorems on dimension-lowering maps are proved for inductive dimensions and fully closed maps from spaces that need not be hereditarily normal, and some examples of continua have non-coinciding dimensions.
