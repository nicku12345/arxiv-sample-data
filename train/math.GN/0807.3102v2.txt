In this paper we search for conditions on a countably compact (pseudo-compact) topological semigroup under which: (i) each maximal subgroup H(e) in S is a (closed) topological subgroup in S; (ii) the Clifford part H(S)(i.e. the union of all maximal subgroups) of the semigroup S is a closed subset in S; (iii) the inversion \operatorname{inv}\colon H(S)\to H(S) is continuous; and (iv) the projection \pi\colon H(S)\to E(S), \pi\colon x\longmapsto xx^{-1}, onto the subset of idempotents E(S) of S, is continuous.
