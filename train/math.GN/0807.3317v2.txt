For any complex affine reductive group G and a fixed choice of maximal compact subgroup K, we show that the G-character variety of a free group strongly deformation retracts to the corresponding K-character space, which is a real semi-algebraic set. Combining this with constructive invariant theory and classical topological methods, we show that the SL(3,C)-character variety of a rank 2 free group is homotopic to an 8 sphere and the SL(2,C)-character variety of a rank 3 free group is homotopic to a 6 sphere.
