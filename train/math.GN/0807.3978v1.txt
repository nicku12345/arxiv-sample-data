Motivated by a question of Isbell, we show that Jensen's Diamond Principle implies there is a non-P-point ultrafilter U on omega such that U, whether ordered by reverse inclusion or reverse inclusion mod finite, is not Tukey equivalent to the finite sets of reals ordered by inclusion. We also show that, for every regular infinite kappa not greater than 2^{aleph_0}, if MA_{sigma-centered} holds, then some ultrafilter U on omega, ordered by reverse inclusion mod finite, is Tukey equivalent to the sets of reals of size less than kappa, ordered by inclusion. We also prove two negative ZFC results about the possible Tukey classes of ultrafilters on omega.
