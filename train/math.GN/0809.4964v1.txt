We study conditions under which the Hausdorff quasi-uniformity {\mathcal U}_H of a quasi-uniform space (X,{\mathcal U}) on the set {\mathcal P}_0(X) of the nonempty subsets of X is bicomplete.   Indeed we present an explicit method to construct the bicompletion of the T_0-quotient of the Hausdorff quasi-uniformity of a quasi-uniform space. It is used to find a characterization of those quasi-uniform T_0-spaces (X,{\mathcal U}) for which the Hausdorff quasi-uniformity \widetilde{{\mathcal U}}_H of their bicompletion (\widetilde{X},{\widetilde{\mathcal U}}) on {\mathcal P}_0(\widetilde{X}) is bicomplete.
