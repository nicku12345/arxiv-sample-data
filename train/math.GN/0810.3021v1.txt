In this paper we introduce and study so-called k^*-metrizable spaces forming a new class of generalized metric spaces, and display various applications of such spaces in topological algebra, functional analysis, and measure theory.   By definition, a Hausdorff topological space X is k^*-metrizable if X is the image of a metrizable space M under a continuous map f:M\to X having a section s:X\to M that preserves precompact sets in the sense that the image s(K) of any compact set K\subset X has compact closure in X.
