Let K be a complete quasivariety of topological inverse Clifford semigroups, containing all topological semilattices. It is shown that the free topological inverse semigroup F(X,K) of X in the class K is an R^\infty-manifold if and only if X has no isolated points and F(X,K) is a retract of an R^\infty-manifold. We derive from this that for any retract X of an R^\infty-manifold the free topological inverse semigroup F(X,K) is an R^\infty-manifold if and only if the space X has no isolated points. Also we show that for any homotopically equivalent retracts X,Y of R^\infty-manifolds with no isolated points the free topological inverse semigroups F(X,K) and F(Y,K) are homeomorphic. This allows us to construct non-homeomorphic spaces whose free topological inverse semigroups are homeomorphic.
