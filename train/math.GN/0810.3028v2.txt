We introduce and study oscillator topologies on paratopological groups and define certain related number invariants. As an application we prove that a Hausdorff paratopological group G admits a weaker Hausdorff group topology provided G is 3-oscillating. A paratopological group G is 3-oscillating (resp. 2-oscillating) provided for any neighborhood U of the unity e of G there is a neighborhood V\subset G of e such that V^{-1}VV^{-1}\subset UU^{-1}U (resp. V^{-1}V\subset UU^{-1}). The class of 2-oscillating paratopological groups includes all collapsing, all nilpotent paratopological groups, all paratopological groups satisfying a positive law, all paratopological SIN-group and all saturated paratopological groups (the latter means that for any nonempty open set U\subset G the set U^{-1} has nonempty interior). We prove that each totally bounded paratopological group G is countably cellular; moreover, every cardinal of uncountable cofinality is a precaliber of G. Also we give an example of a saturated paratopological group which is not isomorphic to its mirror paratopological group as well as an example of a 2-oscillating paratopological group whose mirror paratopological group is not 2-oscillating.
