It is shown that each pseudonorm defined on a subgroup H of an abelian group G can be extended to a pseudonorm on G such that the densities of the obtained pseudometrizable topological groups coincide. We derive from this that any Hausdorff \omega-bounded group topology on H can be extended to a Hausdorff \omega-bounded group topology on G. In its turn this result implies that each separable metrizable abelian group H is a subgroup of a separable metrizable divisible group G. This result essentially relies on the Axiom of Choice and is not true under the Axiom of Determinacy (which contradicts to the Axiom of Choice but implies the Countable Axiom of Choice).
