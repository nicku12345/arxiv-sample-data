For a Banach space B and for a class \A of its bounded closed retracts, endowed with the Hausdorff metric, we prove that retractions on elements A \in \A can be chosen to depend continuously on A, whenever nonconvexity of each A \in \A is less than \f{1}{2}. The key geometric argument is that the set of all uniform retractions onto an \a-paraconvex set (in the spirit of E. Michael) is \frac{\a}{1-\a}-paraconvex subset in the space of continuous mappings of B into itself. For a Hilbert space H the estimate \frac{\a}{1-\a} can be improved to \frac{\a (1+\a^{2})}{1-\a^{2}} and the constant \f{1}{2} can be reduced to the root of the equation \a+ \a^{2}+a^{3}=1.
