Given a group X we study the algebraic structure of the compact right-topological semigroup \lambda(X) consisting of maximal linked systems on X. This semigroup contains the semigroup \beta(X) of ultrafilters as a closed subsemigroup. We construct a faithful representation of the semigroup \lambda(X) in the semigroup of all self-maps of the power-set of X and using this representation describe the structure of minimal ideal and minimal left ideals of \lambda(X) for each twinic group X. The class of twinic groups includes all amenable groups and all groups with periodic commutators but does not include the free group with two generators.
