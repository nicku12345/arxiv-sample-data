A Hausdorff topological group G is minimal if every continuous isomorphism f: G --> H between G and a Hausdorff topological group H is open. Significantly strengthening a 1981 result of Stoyanov, we prove the following theorem: For every infinite minimal abelian group G there exists a sequence {\sigma_n : n\in N} of cardinals such that w(G) = sup {\sigma_n : n \in N} and sup {2^{\sigma_n} : n \in N} \leq |G| \leq 2^{w(G)}, where w(G) is the weight of G. If G is an infinite minimal abelian group, then either |G| = 2^\sigma for some cardinal \sigma, or w(G) = min {\sigma: |G| \leq 2^\sigma}; moreover, the equality |G| = 2^{w(G)} holds whenever cf (w(G)) > \omega. For a cardinal \kappa, we denote by F_\kappa the free abelian group with \kappa many generators. If F_\kappa admits a pseudocompact group topology, then \kappa \geq c, where c is the cardinality of the continuum. We show that the existence of a minimal pseudocompact group topology on F_c is equivalent to the Lusin's Hypothesis 2^{\omega_1} = c. For \kappa > c, we prove that F_\kappa admits a (zero-dimensional) minimal pseudocompact group topology if and only if F_\kappa has both a minimal group topology and a pseudocompact group topology. If \kappa > c, then F_\kappa admits a connected minimal pseudocompact group topology of weight \sigma if and only if \kappa = 2^\sigma. Finally, we establish that no infinite torsion-free abelian group can be equipped with a locally connected minimal group topology.
