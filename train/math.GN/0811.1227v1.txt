Let (X, d) be a Cat(k) space and P a bounded subset of X . If k > 0 then it is required that the diameter of P be less than Pi/(4 sqrt(k)) . Let u: P to R be a bounded non-negative function from P to R. The existence of a unique point in X called the barycenter of P relative to u is established. When u=1, the barycenter is simply the circumcenter of P. The barycenter has a number of properties including a scaling, continuity and limit property. Under suitable conditions, the barycenter is a fixed point of an isometry or group of isometries. Barycenters are used to show that a complete Cat(k) space X is an absolute retract if k is less than or equal to 0, and an absolute neighborhood retract if X is complete and of curvature less than or equal to k.
