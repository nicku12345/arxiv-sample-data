We detect topological semigroups that are topological paragroups, i.e., are isomorphic to a Rees product of a topological group over topological spaces with a continuous sandwich function. We prove that a simple topological semigroup S is a topological paragroup if one of the following conditions is satisfied: (1) S is completely simple and the maximal subgroups of S are topological groups, (2) S contains an idempotent and the square S\times S is countably compact or pseudocompact, (3) S is sequentially compact or each power of S is countably compact. The last item generalizes an old Wallace's result saying that each simple compact topological semigroup is a topological paragroup.
