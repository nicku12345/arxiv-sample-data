We demonstrate that the classical Michael selection theorem for l.s.c. mappings with a collectionwise normal domain can be reduced only to compact-valued mappings modulo Dowker's extension theorem for such spaces. The idea used to achieve this reduction is also applied to get a simple direct proof of that selection theorem of Michael's. Some other possible applications are demonstrated as well.
