Let (X, T) be a topological dynamical system (TDS), and h (T, K) the topological entropy of a subset K of X. (X, T) is {\it lowerable} if for each 0\le h\le h (T, X) there is a non-empty compact subset with entropy h; is {\it hereditarily lowerable} if each non-empty compact subset is lowerable; is {\it hereditarily uniformly lowerable} if for each non-empty compact subset K and each 0\le h\le h (T, K) there is a non-empty compact subset K_h\subseteq K with h (T, K_h)= h and K_h has at most one limit point.   It is shown that each TDS with finite entropy is lowerable, and that a TDS (X, T) is hereditarily uniformly lowerable if and only if it is asymptotically h-expansive.
