We prove that the semigroup operation of a topological semigroup S extends to a continuous semigroup operation on its the Stone-\v{C}ech compactification \beta S provided S is a pseudocompact openly factorizable space, which means that each map f:S\to Y to a second countable space Y can be written as the composition f=g\circ p of an open map p:X\to Z onto a second countable space Z and a map g:Z\to Y. We present a spectral characterization of openly factorizable spaces and establish some properties of such spaces.
