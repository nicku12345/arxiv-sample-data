A Polish group G is called a group of quasi-invariance or a QI-group, if there exist a locally compact group X and a probability measure \mu on X such that 1) there exists a continuous monomorphism of G to X, and 2) for each g\in X either g\in G and the shift \mu_g is equivalent to \mu or g\not\in G and \mu_g is orthogonal to \mu. It is proved that G is a \sigma-compact subset of X. We show that there exists a quotient group \mathbb{T}^H_2 of \ell^2 modulo a discrete subgroup which is a Polish monothetic non locally quasi-convex (and hence nonreflexive) pathwise connected QI-group, and such that the bidual of \mathbb{T}^H_2 is not a QI-group. It is proved also that the bidual group of a QI-group may be not a saturated subgroup of X.
