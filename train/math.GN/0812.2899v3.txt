Let M be a complete metric ANR-space such that for any metric compactum K the function space C(K,M) contains a dense set of Bing (resp., Krasinkiewicz) maps. It is shown that M has the following property: If f\colon X\to Y is a perfect surjection between metric spaces, then C(X,M) with the source limitation topology contains a dense G_\delta-subset of maps g such that all restrictions g|f^{-1}(y), y\in Y, are Bing (resp., Krasinkiewicz) maps. We apply the above result to establish some mapping theorems for extensional dimension.
