In this paper, we show that for every locally compact abelian group G, the following statements are equivalent:   (i) G contains no sequence {x_n} such that {0} \cup {\pm x_n : n \in N} is infinite and quasi-convex in G, and x_n --> 0;   (ii) one of the subgroups {g \in G : 2g=0 and {g \in G : 3g=0} is open in G;   (iii) G contains an open compact subgroup of the form Z_2^\kappa or Z_3^\kappa for some cardinal \kappa.
