Consider a compact oriented surface S of genus g \geq 0 and m \geq 0 punctured. The train track complex of S which is defined by Hamenst\"adt is a 1-complex whose vertices are isotopy classes of complete train tracks on S. Hamenst\"adt shows that if 3g-3+m \geq 2, the mapping class group acts properly discontinuously and cocompactly on the train track complex. We will prove corresponding results for the excluded case, namely when S is a once-punctured torus or a 4-punctured sphere. To work this out, we redefinition of two complexes for these surfaces.
