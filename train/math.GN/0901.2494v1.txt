In this paper we present an extendible, block gluing \mathbb Z^3 shift of finite type W^{\text{el}} in which the topological entropy equals the L-projectional entropy for a two-dimensional sublattice L:=\mathbb Z \vec{e}_1+\mathbb Z\vec{e}_2\subsetneq\mathbb Z^3, even so W^{\text{el}} is not a full \mathbb Z extension of W^{\text{el}}_L. In particular this example shows that Theorem 4.1 of [3] does not generalize to r-dimensional sublattices L for r>1. Nevertheless we are able to reprove and extend the result about one-dimensional sublattices for general (non-SFT) \mathbb Z^d shifts under the same mixing assumption as in [3] and by posing a stronger mixing condition we also obtain the corresponding statement for higher-dimensional sublattices.
