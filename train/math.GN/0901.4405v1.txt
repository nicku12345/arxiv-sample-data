In this paper we introduce and study the notion of pairwise weakly Lindelof bitopological spaces and obtain some results. Further, we also study the pairwise weakly Lindelof subspaces and subsets, investigate some of their properties and show that a pairwise weakly Lindelof property is not a hereditary property.
