In this short note we give an answer to the following question. Let X be a locally compact metric space with group of isometries G. Let \{g_i\} be a net in G for which g_ix converges to y, for some x,y\in X. What can we say about the convergence of \{g_i\}? We show that there exist a subnet \{g_j\} of \{g_i\} and an isometry f:C_x\to X such that g_{j} converges to f pointwise on C_x and f(C_x)=C_{f(x)}, where C_x and C_y denote the pseudo-components of x and y respectively. Applying this we give short proofs of the van Dantzig--van der Waerden theorem (1928) and Gao--Kechris theorem (2003).
