Let X be a compact metrizable abelian group and \mathbf{u}=\{u_n\} be a sequence in its dual X^{\wedge}. Set s_{\mathbf{u}} (X)= \{x: (u_n,x)\to 1\} and \mathbb{T}_0^H = \{(z_n)\in \mathbb{T}^{\infty} : z_n\to 1 \}. Let G be a subgroup of X. We prove that G=s_{\mathbf{u}} (X) for some \mathbf{u} iff it can be represented as some dually closed subgroup G_{\mathbf{u}} of {\rm Cl}_X G \times \mathbb{T}_0^H. In particular, s_{\mathbf{u}} (X) is polishable. Let \mathbf{u}=\{u_n\} be a T-sequence. Denote by (\widehat{X}, \mathbf{u}) the group X^{\wedge} equipped with the finest group topology in which u_n \to 0. It is proved that (\widehat{X}, \mathbf{u})^{\wedge} =G_{\mathbf{u}} and \mathbf{n} (\widehat{X}, \mathbf{u}) = s_{\mathbf{u}} (X)^{\perp}. We also prove that the group generated by a Kronecker set can not be characterized.
