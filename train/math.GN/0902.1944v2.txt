Arhangel'skii proved that if a first countable Hausdorff space is Lindel\"of, then its cardinality is at most 2^{\aleph_0}. Such a clean upper bound for Lindel\"of spaces in the larger class of spaces whose points are {\sf G}_{\delta} has been more elusive. In this paper we continue the agenda started in F.D. Tall, On the cardinality of Lindel\"of spaces with points G_{\delta}, Topology and its Applications 63 (1995), 21 - 38, of considering the cardinality problem for spaces satisfying stronger versions of the Lindel\"of property. Infinite games and selection principles, especially the Rothberger property, are essential tools in our investigations
