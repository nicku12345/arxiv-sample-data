In the recent paper "Reparametrizations of continuous paths", J. Homotopy Relat. Struct. 2 (2007), 93-117 (with U. Fahrenberg), we performed a systematic investigation of reparametrizations of continuous paths in a Hausdorff space that relies crucially on a proper understanding of stop data of a (weakly increasing) reparametrization of the unit interval. I am grateful to Marco Grandis (Genova) for pointing out to me that the proof of Proposition 3.7 in that paper is wrong. Fortunately, the statement of that Proposition and the results depending on it stay correct. It is the purpose of this note to provide correct proofs.
