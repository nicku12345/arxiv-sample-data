Following a similar result of Uspenskij on the unitary group of a separable Hilbert space we show that with respect to the lower (or Roelcke) uniform structure the Polish group G= \Aut(\mu), of automorphisms of an atomless standard Borel probability space (X,\mu), is precompact. We identify the corresponding compactification as the space of Markov operators on L_2(\mu) and deduce that the algebra of right and left uniformly continuous functions, the algebra of weakly almost periodic functions, and the algebra of Hilbert functions on G, all coincide. Again following Uspenskij we also conclude that G is totally minimal.
