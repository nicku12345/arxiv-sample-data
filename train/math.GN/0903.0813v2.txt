By the {\em Suslinian number} \Sln(X) of a continuum X we understand the smallest cardinal number \kappa such that X contains no disjoint family \C of non-degenerate subcontinua of size |\C|\ge\kappa. For a compact space X, \Sln(X) is the smallest Suslinian number of a continuum which contains a homeomorphic copy of X. Our principal result asserts that each compact space X has weight \le\Sln(X)^+ and is the limit of an inverse well-ordered spectrum of length \le \Sln(X)^+, consisting of compacta with weight \le\Sln(X) and monotone bonding maps. Moreover, w(X)\le\Sln(X) if no \Sln(X)^+-Suslin tree exists. This implies that under the Suslin Hypothesis all Suslinian continua are metrizable, which answers a question of \cite{DNTTT1}. On the other hand, the negation of the Suslin Hypothesis is equivalent to the existence of a hereditarily separable non-metrizable Suslinian continuum. If X is a continuum with \Sln(X)<2^{\aleph_0}, then X is 1-dimensional, has rim-weight \le\Sln(X) and weight w(X)\ge\Sln(X). Our main tool is the inequality w(X)\le\Sln(X)\cdot w(f(X)) holding for any light map f:X\to Y.
