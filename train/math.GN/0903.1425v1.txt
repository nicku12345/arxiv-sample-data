Let G be an abelian group. We prove that a group G admits a Hausdorff group topology \tau such that the von Neumann radical \mathbf{n}(G, \tau) of (G, \tau) is non-trivial and finite iff G has a non-trivial finite subgroup. If G is a topological group, then \mathbf{n} (\mathbf{n} (G)) \not= \mathbf{n} (G) if and only if \mathbf{n} (G) is not dually embedded. In particular, \mathbf{n} (\mathbf{n} (\mathbb{Z},\tau)) = \mathbf{n} (\mathbb{Z},\tau) for any Hausdorff group topology \tau on \mathbb{Z}.
