In this paper some applications of the methods and results of its first part and of the results of M. Stone, H. de Vries, P. Roeper are given. In particular: some generalizations of the Stone Duality Theorem are obtained; a completion theorem for local contact Boolean algebras is proved; a direct proof of the Ponomarev's solution of Birkhoff's Problem 72 is found, and the spaces which are co-absolute with the (zero-dimensional) Eberlein compacts are described.
