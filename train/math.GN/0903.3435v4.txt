The notion of a regular operator with compact supports between function spaces is introduced. On that base we obtain a characterization of absolute extensors for zero-dimensional spaces in terms of regular extension operators having compact supports. Milyutin maps are also considered and it is established that some topological properties, like paracompactness, metrizability and k-metrizability, are preserved under Milyutin maps.
