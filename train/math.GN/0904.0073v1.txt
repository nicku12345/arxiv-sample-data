In this note we shall prove that the Stone-\v{C}ech compactification of \mathcal{L}^n is the space \bar{\mathcal{L}}^n where \bar{\mathcal{L}} is the extended long line, namely, \mathcal{L} together with its ends \pm \Omega. We give a similar description for the Stone-\v{C}ech compactification of the cartesian power of the semi-closed half-long line \mathcal{L}_+. As an application we show that any torsion subgroup of the group of all homeomorphisms of \cj^n (resp. \cl^n) is isomorphic to a subgroup of the symmetric group S_n (resp. the semidirect product (\bz/2\bz)^n\ltimes S_n).
