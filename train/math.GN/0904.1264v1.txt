In this paper we introduce a general notion of weak extension property for embeddings induced by a group actions. As an example, for the group H(M, m) of measure-preserving homeomorphisms of a noncompact manifold M, we deduce weak type extension theorems, and as an application we exhibit the local contractibility of the group H_c(M, m) of measure-preserving homeomorphisms with compact support of a noncompact connected manifold M endowed with the Whitney topology.
