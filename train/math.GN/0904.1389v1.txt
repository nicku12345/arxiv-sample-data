Assuming the absence of Q-points (which is consistent with ZFC) we prove that the free topological group F(X) over a Tychonov space X is o-bounded if and only if every continuous metrizable image T of X satisfies the selection principle U_{fin}(O,\Omega) (the latter means that for every sequence <u_n>_{n\in w} of open covers of T there exists a sequence <v_n>_{n\in w} such that v_n\in [u_n]^{<w} and for every F\in [X]^{<w} there exists n\in w with F\subset\cup v_n). This characterization gives a consistent answer to a problem posed by C. Hernandes, D. Robbie, and M. Tkachenko in 2000.
