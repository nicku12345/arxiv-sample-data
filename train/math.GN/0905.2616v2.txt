Let X be a Hausdorff topological group and G a locally compact subgroup of X. We show that the natural action of G on X is proper in the sense of R. Palais. This is applied to prove that there exists a closed set F of X such that FG=X and the restriction of the quotient projection X -> X/G to F is a perfect map F -> X/G. This is a key result to prove that many topological properties (among them, paracompactness and normality) are transferred from X to ferred from X/G to X. Yet another application leads to the inequality dim X<= dim X/G + dim G for every paracompact group X and its locally compact subgroup G.
