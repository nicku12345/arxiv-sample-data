It is proved that the suspension of a closed n-dimensional manifold M, n\ge1, does not embed in a product of n+1 curves. In fact, the ultimate result will be proved in a much more general setting. This is a far-reaching generalization the Borsuk theorem on non-embeddability of the (n+1)-dimensional sphere in a product of n+1 curves.
