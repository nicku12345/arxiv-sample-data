In [G. Curi, "Exact approximations to Stone-Cech compactification'', Ann. Pure Appl. Logic, 146, 2-3, 2007, pp. 103-123] a characterization is obtained of the locales of which the Stone-Cech compactification can be defined in constructive type theory CTT, and in the formal system CZF+uREA+DC, a natural extension of Aczel's system for constructive set theory CZF by a strengthening of the Regular Extension Axiom REA and the principle of dependent choice. In this paper I show that this characterization continues to hold over the standard system CZF plus REA, thus removing in particular any dependency from a choice principle. This will follow by a result of independent interest, namely the proof that the class of continuous mappings from a compact regular locale X to a regular a set-presented locale Y is a set in CZF, even without REA. It is then shown that the existence of Stone-Cech compactification of a non-degenerate Boolean locale is independent of the axioms of CZF (+REA), so that the obtained characterization characterizes a proper subcollection of the collection of all locales. The same also holds for several, even impredicative, extensions of CZF+REA, as well as for CTT. This is in contrast with what happens in the context of Higher-order Heyting arithmetic HHA - and thus in any topos-theoretic universe: by constructions of Johnstone, Banaschewski and Mulvey, within HHA Stone-Cech compactification can be defined for every locale.
