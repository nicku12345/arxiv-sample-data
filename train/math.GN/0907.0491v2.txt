We prove a generalization of the Edwards-Walsh Resolution Theorem:   Theorem: Let G be an abelian group for which P_G equals the set of all primes \mathbb{P}, where P_G=\{p \in \mathbb{P}: \Z_{(p)}\in Bockstein Basis  \sigma(G)\}. Let n in N and let K be a connected CW-complex with \pi_n(K)\cong G, \pi_k(K)\cong 0 for 0\leq k< n. Then for every compact metrizable space X with X\tau K (i.e., with K an absolute extensor for X), there exists a compact metrizable space Z and a surjective map \pi: Z \to X such that (a) \pi is cell-like, (b) \dim Z \leq n, and (c) Z\tau K.
