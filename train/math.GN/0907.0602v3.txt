We discuss some notions of compactness and convergence relative to a specified family F of subsets of some topological space X. The two most interesting particular cases of our construction appear to be the following ones.   (1) The case in which F is the family of all singletons of X, in which case we get back the more usual notions.   (2) The case in which F is the family of all nonempty open subsets of X, in which case we get notions related to pseudocompactness.   A large part of the results in this note are known in particular case (1); the results are, in general, new in case (2). As an example, we characterize those spaces which are D-pseudocompact, for some ultrafilter D uniform over \lambda.
