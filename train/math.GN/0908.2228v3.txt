Let (X_n)_{n} be a sequence of uniform spaces such that each space X_n is a closed subspace in X_{n+1}. We give an explicit description of the topology and uniformity of the direct limit u-lim X_n of the sequence (X_n) in the category of uniform spaces. This description implies that a function f:u-lim X_n\to Y to a uniform space Y is continuous if for every n the restriction f|X_n is continuous and regular at the subset X_{n-1} in the sense that for any entourages U\in\U_Y and V\in\U_X there is an entourage V\in\U_X such that for each point x\in B(X_{n-1},V) there is a point x'\in X_{n-1} with (x,x')\in V and (f(x),f(x'))\in U. Also we shall compare topologies of direct limits in various categories.
