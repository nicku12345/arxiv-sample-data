Given a non-degenerate Peano continuum X, a dimension function D:2^X_*\to[0,\infty] defined on the family 2^X_* of compact subsets of X, and a subset \Gamma\subset[0,\infty), we recognize the topological structure of the system (2^X,\D_{\le\gamma}(X))_{\alpha\in\Gamma}, where 2^X is the hyperspace of non-empty compact subsets of X and D_{\le\gamma}(X) is the subspace of 2^X, consisting of non-empty compact subsets K\subset X with D(K)\le\gamma.
