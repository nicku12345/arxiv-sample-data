In a recent paper by D. Shakhmatov and J. Sp\v{e}v\'ak [Group-valued continuous functions with the topology of pointwise convergence, Topology and its Applications (2009), doi:10.1016/j.topol.2009.06.022] the concept of a {\rm TAP} group is introduced and it is shown in particular that {\rm NSS} groups are {\rm TAP}. We prove that conversely, Weil complete metrizable {\rm TAP} groups are {\rm NSS}. We define also the narrower class of {\rm STAP} groups, show that the {\rm NSS} groups are in fact {\rm STAP} and that the converse statement is true in metrizable case. A remarkable characterization of pseudocompact spaces obtained in the paper by D. Shakhmatov and J. Sp\v{e}v\'ak asserts: a Tychonoff space X is pseudocompact if and only if C_p(X,\mathbb R) has the {\rm TAP} property. We show that for no infinite Tychonoff space X, the group C_p(X,\mathbb R) has the {\rm STAP} property. We also show that a metrizable locally balanced topological vector group is {\rm STAP} iff it does not contain a subgroup topologically isomorphic to \mathbb Z^{(\mathbb N)}.
