Let f: X\times K\to \mathbb R be a separately continuous function and \mathcal C a countable collection of subsets of K. Following a result of Calbrix and Troallic, there is a residual set of points x\in X such that f is jointly continuous at each point of \{x\}\times Q, where Q is the set of y\in K for which the collection \mathcal C includes a basis of neighborhoods in K. The particular case when the factor K is second countable was recently extended by Moors and Kenderov to any \v{C}ech-complete Lindel\"of space K and Lindel\"of \alpha-favorable X, improving a generalization of Namioka's theorem obtained by Talagrand. Moors proved the same result when K is a Lindel\"of p-space and X is conditionally \sigma-\alpha-favorable space. Here we add new results of this sort when the factor X is \sigma_{C(X)}-\beta-defavorable and when the assumption "base of neighborhoods" in Calbrix-Troallic's result is replaced by a type of countable completeness. The paper also provides further information about the class of Namioka spaces.
