We introduce a notion of productivity (summability) of sequences in a topological group G, parametrized by a given function f : N --> omega+1. The extreme case when f is the function taking constant value omega is closely related to the TAP property, the weaker version of the well-known property NSS. We prove that TAP property coincides with NSS in locally compact groups, omega-bounded abelian groups and countably compact minimal abelian groups. As an application of our results, we provide a negative answer to [13, Question 11.1].
