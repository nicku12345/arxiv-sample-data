A family \bfam of continuous real-valued functions on a space X is said to be {\sl basic} if every f \in C(X) can be represented f = \sum_{i=1}^n g_i \circ \phi_i for some \phi_i \in \bfam and g_i \in C(\R) (i=1, ..., n). Define \basic (X) = \min \{|\bfam| : \bfam is a basic family for X\}. If X is separable metrizable X then either X is locally compact and finite dimensional, and \basic (X) < \aleph_0, or \basic (X) = \mathfrak{c}. If K is compact and either w(K) (the minimal size of a basis for K) has uncountable cofinality or K has a discrete subset D with |D|=w(K) then either K is finite dimensional, and \basic (K) = \cof ([w(K)]^{\aleph_0}, \subseteq), or \basic (K) = |C(K)|=w(K)^{\aleph_0}.
