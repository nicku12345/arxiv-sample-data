The recent literature offers examples, specific and hand-crafted, of Tychonoff spaces (in ZFC) which respond negatively to these questions, due respectively to Ceder and Pearson (1967) and to Comfort and Garc\'ia-Ferreira (2001): (1) Is every \omega-resolvable space maximally resolvable? (2) Is every maximally resolvable space extraresolvable? Now using the method of {\mathcal{KID}} expansion, the authors show that {\it every} suitably restricted Tychonoff topological space (X,\sT) admits a larger Tychonoff topology (that is, an "expansion") witnessing such failure. Specifically the authors show in ZFC that if (X,\sT) is a maximally resolvable Tychonoff space with S(X,\sT)\leq\Delta(X,\sT)=\kappa, then (X,\sT) has Tychonoff expansions \sU=\sU_i (1\leq i\leq5), with \Delta(X,\sU_i)=\Delta(X,\sT) and S(X,\sU_i)\leq\Delta(X,\sU_i), such that (X,\sU_i) is: (i=1) \omega-resolvable but not maximally resolvable; (i=2) [if \kappa' is regular, with S(X,\sT)\leq\kappa'\leq\kappa] \tau-resolvable for all \tau<\kappa', but not \kappa'-resolvable; (i=3) maximally resolvable, but not extraresolvable; (i=4) extraresolvable, but not maximally resolvable; (i=5) maximally resolvable and extraresolvable, but not strongly extraresolvable.
