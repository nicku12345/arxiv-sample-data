In our earlier paper (K. Eda, U. Karimov, and D. Repov\v{s}, \emph{A construction of simply connected noncontractible cell-like two-dimensional Peano continua}, Fund. Math. \textbf{195} (2007), 193--203) we introduced a cone-like space SC(Z). In the present note we establish some new algebraic properties of SC(Z).
