We construct an example of a Peano continuum X such that: (i) X is a one-point compactification of a polyhedron; (ii) X is weakly homotopy equivalent to a point (i.e. \pi_n(X) is trivial for all n \geq 0); (iii) X is noncontractible; and (iv) X is homologically and cohomologically locally connected (i.e. X is a HLC and clc space). We also prove that all classical homology groups (singular, \v{C}ech, and Borel-Moore), all classical cohomology groups (singular and \v{C}ech), and all finite-dimensional Hawaiian groups of X are trivial.
