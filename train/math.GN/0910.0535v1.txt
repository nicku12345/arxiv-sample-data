We study algebraic properties of the Brandt \lambda^0-extensions of monoids with zero and non-trivial homomorphisms between the Brandt \lambda^0-extensions of monoids with zero. We introduce finite, compact topological Brandt \lambda^0-extensions of topological semigroups and countably compact topological Brandt \lambda^0-extensions of topological inverse semigroups in the class of topological inverse semigroups and establish the structure of such extensions and non-trivial continuous homomorphisms between such topological Brandt \lambda^0-extensions of topological monoids with zero. We also describe a category whose objects are ingredients in the constructions of finite (compact, countably compact) topological Brandt \lambda^0-extensions of topological monoids with zeros.
