We give a construction under CH of a non-metrizable compact Hausdorff space K such that any uncountable semi-biorthogonal sequence in C(K) must be of a very specific kind. The space K has many nice properties, such as being hereditarily separable, hereditarily Lindel\"of and a 2-to-1 continuous preimage of a metric space, and all Radon measures on K are separable. However K is not a Rosenthal compactum.   We introduce the notion of bidiscrete systems in compact spaces and note that every infinite compact Hausdorff space K must have a bidiscrete system of size d(K), the density of K. This, in particular, implies that C(K) has a biorthogonal system of size d(K).
