Generalizing de Vries Compactification Theorem and strengthening Leader Local Compactification Theorem, we describe the partially ordered set (\LL(X),\le) of all (up to equivalence) locally compact Hausdorff extensions of a Tychonoff space X. Using this description, we find the necessary and sufficient conditions which has to satisfy a map between two Tychonoff spaces in order to have some kind of extension over arbitrary given in advance Hausdorff local compactifications of these spaces; we regard the following kinds of extensions: open, quasi-open, skeletal, perfect, injective, surjective. In this way we generalize some results of V. Z. Poljakov.
