We define topological invariants of regular Lagrangian fibrations using the integral affine structure on the base space and we show that these coincide with the classes known in the literature. We also classify all symplectic types of Lagrangian fibrations with base \rpr and fixed monodromy representation, generalising a construction due to Bates.
