Building on work of Terada, we prove that h-homogeneity is productive in the class of zero-dimensional spaces. Then, by generalizing a result of Motorov, we show that for every non-empty zero-dimensional space X there exists a non-empty zero-dimensional space Y such that X\times Y is h-homogeneous. Also, we simultaneously generalize results of Motorov and Terada by showing that if X is a space such that the isolated points are dense then X^\kappa is h-homogeneous for every infinite cardinal \kappa. Finally, we show that a question of Terada (whether X^\omega is h-homogeneous for every zero-dimensional first-countable X) is equivalent to a question of Motorov (whether such an infinite power is always divisible by 2) and give some partial answers.
