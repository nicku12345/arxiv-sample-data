In this paper we introduce and study three new cardinal topological invariants called the cs*, cs-, and sb-characters. The class of topological spaces with countable cs*-character is closed under many topological operations and contains all aleph-spaces and all spaces with point-countable cs*-network. Our principal result states that each non-metrizable sequential topological group with countable cs*-character has countable pseudo-character and contains an open k_\omega-subgroup.
