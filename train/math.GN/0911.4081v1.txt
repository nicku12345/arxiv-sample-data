Suppose G is a topological group containing a (closed) topological copy of the Frechet-Urysohn fan. If G is a perfectly normal sequential space (a normal k-space) then every closed metrizable subset in G is locally compact. Applying this result to topological groups whose underlying topological space can be written as a direct limit of a sequence of closed metrizable subsets, we get that every such a group either is metrizable or is homeomorphic to the product of a k_\omega-space and a discrete space.
