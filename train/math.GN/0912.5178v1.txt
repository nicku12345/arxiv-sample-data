A maxitive measure is the analogue of a finitely additive measure or charge, in which the usual addition is replaced by the supremum operation. Contrarily to charges, maxitive measures often have a density. We show that maxitive measures can be decomposed as the supremum of a maxitive measure with density, and a residual maxitive measure that is null on compact sets under specific conditions.
