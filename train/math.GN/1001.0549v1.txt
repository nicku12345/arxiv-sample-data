We show that under some conditions on a family \mathcal{A}\subset\bbi there exists a subfamily \mathcal{A}_0\subset\mathcal{A} such that \bigcup \mathcal{A}_0 is nonmeasurable with respect to a fixed ideal \bbi with Borel base of a fixed uncountable Polish space. Our result applies to the classical ideal of null subsets of the real line and to the ideal of first category subsets of the real line.
