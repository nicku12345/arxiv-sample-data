The n-th Zariski topology on a group G is generated by the sub-base consiting of the cozero sets of monomials of degree \le n on G. We prove that for each group G the 2-nd Zariski topology is not discrete and present an example of a group G of cardinality continuum whose 2-nd Zariski topology has countable pseudocharacter. On the other hand, the non-topologizable group G constructed by Ol'shanskii has discrete 665-th Zariski topology.
