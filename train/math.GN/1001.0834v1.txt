Let X_n, n\in\Bbb N be a sequence of non-empty sets, \psi_n:X_n^2\to\Bbb R^+. We consider the relation E((X_n,\psi_n)_{n\in\Bbb N}) on \prod_{n\in\Bbb N}X_n by (x,y)\in E((X_n,\psi_n)_{n\in\Bbb N})\Leftrightarrow\sum_{n\in\Bbb N}\psi_n(x(n),y(n))<+\infty. If E((X_n,\psi_n)_{n\in\Bbb N}) is a Borel equivalence relation, we show a trichotomy that either \Bbb R^\Bbb N/\ell_1\le_B E, E_1\le_B E, or E\le_B E_0.   We also prove that, for a rather general case, E((X_n,\psi_n)_{n\in\Bbb N}) is an equivalence relation iff it is an \ell_p-like equivalence relation.
