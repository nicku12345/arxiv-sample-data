Let \Sigma be a surface of negative Euler characteristic together with a pants decomposition \P. Kra's plumbing construction endows \Sigma with a projective structure as follows. Replace each pair of pants by a triply punctured sphere and glue, or `plumb', adjacent pants by gluing punctured disk neighbourhoods of the punctures. The gluing across the i^{th} pants curve is defined by a complex parameter \tau_i \in \C. The associated holonomy representation \rho: \pi_1(\Sigma) \to PSL(2,\C) gives a projective structure on \Sigma which depends holomorphically on the \tau_i. In particular, the traces of all elements \rho(\gamma), \gamma \in \pi_1(\Sigma), are polynomials in the \tau_i.   Generalising results proved in previous papers for the once and twice punctured torus respectively, we prove a formula giving a simple linear relationship between the coefficients of the top terms of \rho(\gamma), as polynomials in the \tau_i, and the Dehn-Thurston coordinates of \gamma relative to \P.   This will be applied elsewhere to give a formula for the asymptotic directions of pleating rays in the Maskit embedding of \Sigma as the bending measure tends to zero.
