A metric space M us said to have the fibered approximation property in dimension n (br., M\in \mathrm{FAP}(n)) if for any \epsilon>0, m\geq 0 and any map g: I^m\times I^n\to M there exists a map g':I^m\times I^n\to M such that g' is \epsilon-homotopic to g and \dim g'\big(\{z\}\times I^n\big)\leq n for all z\in I^m. The class of spaces having the \mathrm{FAP}(n)-property is investigated in this paper. The main theorems are applied to obtain generalizations of some results due to Uspenskij and Tuncali-Valov.
