For any countable torsion subgroup H of an unbounded Abelian group G there is a complete Hausdorff group topology \tau such that H is the von Neumann radical of (G,\tau). In particular, any unbounded torsion countable Abelian group admits a complete Hausdorff minimally almost periodic (MinAP) group topology. If G is a bounded torsion countably infinite Abelian group, then it admits a MinAP group topology if and only if all its leading Ulm-Kaplansky invariants are infinite. In such a case, a MinAP group topology can be chosen to be complete.
