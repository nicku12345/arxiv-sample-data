We investigate preservation of the Lindel\"of property of topological spaces under forcing extensions. We give sufficient conditions for a forcing notion to preserve several strengthenings of the Lindel\"of property, such as indestructible Lindel\"of property, the Rothberger property and being a Lindel\"of P-space.
