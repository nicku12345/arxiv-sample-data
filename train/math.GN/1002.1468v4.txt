For any countable subgroup H of an unbounded Abelian group G there is a complete Hausdorff group topology \tau such that H is the von Neumann radical of (G,\tau). In particular, we obtain the positive answer to Comfort's question: any unbounded countable Abelian group admits a complete Hausdorff minimally almost periodic (MinAP) group topology. A bounded infinite Abelian group admits a MinAP group topology if and only if all its leading Ulm-Kaplansky invariants are infinite. If, in addition, G is countably infinite, a MinAP group topology can be chosen to be complete.
