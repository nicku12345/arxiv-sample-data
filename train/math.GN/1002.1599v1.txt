A classical result of topological algebra states that any compact left topological semigroup has an idempotent. We refine this by showing that any compact left topological left semiring has a common, i.e. additive and multiplicative simultaneously, idempotent. As an application, we partially answer a question related to algebraic properties of ultrafilters over natural numbers. Finally, we observe that similar arguments establish the existence of common idempotents in much more general, non-associative universal algebras.
