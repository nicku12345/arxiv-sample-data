Under (\diamondsuit^*) we construct a locally countable, locally compact, 0-dimensional T_2 space X of size \omg which is aD however not even linearly D. This consistently answers a question of Arhangel'skii, whether aD implies D. Furthermore we answer two problems concerning characterization of linearly D-spaces, raised by Guo and Junnila.
