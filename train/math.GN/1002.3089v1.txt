The Isbell, compact-open and point-open topologies on the set C(X,\mathbb{R}) of continuous real-valued maps can be represented as the dual topologies with respect to some collections \alpha(X) of compact families of open subsets of a topological space X. Those \alpha(X) for which addition is jointly continuous at the zero function in C_\alpha(X,\mathbb{R}) are characterized, and sufficient conditions for translations to be continuous are found. As a result, collections \alpha(X) for which C_{\alpha}(X,\mathbb{R}) is a topological vector space are defined canonically. The Isbell topology coincides with this vector space topology if and only if X is infraconsonant. Examples based on measure theoretic methods, that C_\alpha (X,\mathbb{R}) can be strictly finer than the compact-open topology, are given. To our knowledge, this is the first example of a splitting group topology strictly finer than the compact-open topology.
