We present a series of examples of nondiscrete reflexive P-groups (i.e., groups in which all G_\delta-sets are open) as well as noncompact reflexive \omega-bounded groups (in which the closure of every countable set is compact). Our main result implies that every product of feathered (equivalently, almost metrizable) Abelian groups equipped with the P-modified topology is a reflexive group. In particular, every compact Abelian group with the P-modified topology is reflexive. This answers a question posed by S. Hern\'andez and P. Nickolas and solves a problem raised by Ardanza-Trevijano, Chasco, Dom\'{\i}nguez, and Tkachenko.
