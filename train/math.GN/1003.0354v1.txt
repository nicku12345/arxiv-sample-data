In this paper we investigate the functors of OH of positively homogenous functionals and OS of semiadditive functionals. We show that OH(X) is AR if and only if X is openly generated, and OS(X) is AR if and only if X is an openly generated compactum of weight less than \omega_1. Also, we investigate the multiplication maps of monads generated by the abovementioned functors and consider when these mappings are soft.
