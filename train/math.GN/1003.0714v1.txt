In this paper we invastigate the notion of generalized (I,J) - Luzin set. This notion generalize the standard notion of Luzin set and Sierpinski set. We find set theoretical conditions which imply the existence of generalized (I,J) - Luzin set. We show how to construct large family of pairwise non-equivalent (I,J) - Luzin sets. We find a class of forcings which preserves the property of being (I,J) - Luzin set.
