Given a topological group G we calculate or evaluate the cardinal characteristic c_k(G) (and c_k^B(G)) equal to the smallest cardinality of a k-centerpole subset C\subset G for (Borel) colorings of G. A subset C\subset G of a topological group G is called {\em k-centerpole} if for each (Borel) k-coloring of G there is an unbounded monochromatic subset G, which is symmetric with respect to a point c\in C in the sense that S=cS^{-1}c.
