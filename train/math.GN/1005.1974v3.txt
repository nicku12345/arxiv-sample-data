We construct a family of Hausdorff spaces such that every finite product of spaces in the family (possibly with repetitions) is CLP-compact, while the product of all spaces in the family is non-CLP-compact. Our example will yield a single Hausdorff space X such that every finite power of X is CLP-compact, while no infinite power of X is CLP-compact. This answers a question of Stepr\={a}ns and \v{S}ostak.
