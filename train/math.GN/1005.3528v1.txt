We strengthen the property \Delta of a function f:[\omega_2]^2\rightarrow [\omega_2]^{\leq \omega} considered by Baumgartner and Shelah. This allows us to consider new types of amalgamations in the forcing used by Rabus, Juh\'asz and Soukup to construct thin-very tall compact scattered spaces. We consistently obtain spaces K as above where K^n is hereditarily separable for each n\in\N. This serves as a counterexample concerning cardinal functions on compact spaces as well as having some applications in Banach spaces: the Banach space C(K) is an Asplund space of density \aleph_2 which has no Fr\'echet smooth renorming, nor an uncountable biorthogonal system.
