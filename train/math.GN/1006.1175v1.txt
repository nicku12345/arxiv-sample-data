The aim of this paper is to present a survey of some recent results obtained in the study of spaces with asymmetric norm. The presentation follows the ideas from the theory of normed spaces (topology, continuous linear operators, continuous linear functionals, duality, geometry of asymmetric normed spaces, compact operators) emphasizing similarities as well as differences with respect to the classical theory. The main difference comes form the fact that the dual of an asymmetric normed space X is not a linear space, but merely a convex cone in the space of all linear functionals on X. Due to this fact, a careful treatment of the duality problems (e.g. reflexivity) and of other results as, for instance, the extension of fundamental principles of functional analysis -the open mapping theorem and the closed graph theorem - to this setting, is needed.
