We prove that each non-separable completely metrizable convex subset of a Frechet space is homeomorphic to a Hilbert space. This resolves an old (more than 30 years) problem of infinite-dimensional topology. Combined with the topological classification of separable convex sets due to Klee, Dobrowoslki and Torunczyk, this result implies that each closed convex subset of a Frechet space is homemorphic to [0,1]^n\times [0,1)^m\times l_2(k) for some cardinals 0\le n\le\omega, 0\le m\le 1 and k\ge 0.
