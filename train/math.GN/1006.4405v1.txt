Let X be a Polish space, d a pseudo-metric on X. If \{(u,v):d(u,v)<\delta\} is {\bf\Pi}^1_1 for each \delta>0, we show that either (X,d) is separable or there are \delta>0 and a perfect set C\subseteq X such that d(u,v)\ge\delta for distinct u,v\in C.   Granting this dichotomy, we characterize the positions of \ell_p-like and c_0-like equivalence relations in the Borel reducibility hierarchy.
