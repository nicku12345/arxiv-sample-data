In this paper we study the semigroup I_\infty^\dnearrow(N) of partial co-finite almost monotone bijective transformations of the set of positive integers \mathbb{N}. We show that the semigroup I_\infty^\dnearrow(N) has algebraic properties similar to the bicyclic semigroup: it is bisimple and all of its non-trivial group homomorphisms are either isomorphisms or group homomorphisms. Also we prove that every Baire topology \tau on I_\infty^\dnearrow(N) such that (I_\infty^\dnearrow(N),\tau) is a semitopological semigroup is discrete, describe the closure of (I_\infty^\dnearrow(N),\tau) in a topological semigroup and construct non-discrete Hausdorff semigroup topologies on I_\infty^\dnearrow(N).
