It is well known that if G is an \'etale topological groupoid then its topology can be recovered as the sup-lattice generated by G-sets, i.e. by the images of local bisections. This topology has a natural structure of unital involutive quantale. We present the analogous construction for any non \'etale groupoid with sober unit space G_0. We associate a canonical unital involutive quantale with any inverse semigroup of G-sets which is also a sheaf over G_0. We introduce axiomatically the class of quantales so obtained, and revert the construction mentioned above by proving a representability theorem for this class of quantales, under a natural spatiality condition.
