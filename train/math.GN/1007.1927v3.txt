In this paper, we study precompact abelian groups G that contain no sequence {x_n} such that {0} \cup {\pm x_n : n \in N} is infinite and quasi-convex in G, and x_n --> 0. We characterize groups with this property in the following classes of groups:   (a) bounded precompact abelian groups;   (b) minimal abelian groups;   (c) totally minimal abelian groups;   (d) \omega-bounded abelian groups.   We also provide examples of minimal abelian groups with this property, and show that there exists a minimal pseudocompact abelian group with the same property; furthermore, under Martin's Axiom, the group may be chosen to be countably compact minimal abelian.
