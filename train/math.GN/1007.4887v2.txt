The explicit description of the topology of the free product of topological groups being Hausdorff is given. In particular, it is shown that it coincides with the so-called X_0-topology for the corresponding colimit X in the category of topological spaces. Applying this fact, a new short proof of the well-known Graev's theorem asserting that the free product of topological groups being Hausdorff is Hausdorff is given.
