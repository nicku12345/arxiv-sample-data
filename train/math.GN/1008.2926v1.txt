The inclusion hyperspace functor, the capacity functor and monads for these functors have been extended from the category of compact Hausdorff spaces to the category of Tychonoff spaces. Properties of spaces and maps of inclusion hyperspaces and capacities (non-additive measures) on Tychonoff spaces are investigated.
