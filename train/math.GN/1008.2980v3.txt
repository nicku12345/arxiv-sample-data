The author proposes a method for investigating actions of finite groups on aspherical spaces. Complete homotopy classification of free actions of finite groups on aspherical spaces is obtained. Also there are some results about non-free actions. For example a relation between the cohomology of finite groups and the lattice structure of its subgroups is obtained by the proposed method. This relation is formulated in terms of spectral sequences.
