We study the typical behavior of bounded linear operators on infinite dimensional complex separable Hilbert spaces in the norm, strong-star, strong, weak polynomial and weak topologies. In particular, we investigate typical spectral properties, the problem of unitary equivalence of typical operators, and their embeddability into C_0-semigroups. Our results provide information on the applicability of Baire category methods in the theory of Hilbert space operators.
