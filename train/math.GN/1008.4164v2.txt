Let M be a non-zero module over an associative (not necessarily commutative) ring. In this paper, we investigate the so-called \emph{second} and \emph{coprime} submodules of M. Moreover, we topologize the spectrum % \mathrm{Spec}^{\mathrm{s}}(M) of second submodules of M and the spectrum % \mathrm{Spec}^{\mathrm{c}}(M) of coprime submodules of M, study several properties of these spaces and investigate their interplay with the algebraic properties of M.
