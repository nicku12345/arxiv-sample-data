For \kappa a cardinal, a space X=(X,\sT) is \kappa-{\it resolvable} if X admits \kappa-many pairwise disjoint \sT-dense subsets; (X,\sT) is {\it exactly} \kappa-{\it resolvable} if it is \kappa-resolvable but not \kappa^+-resolvable.   The present paper complements and supplements the authors' earlier work, which showed for suitably restricted spaces (X,\sT) and cardinals \kappa\geq\lambda\geq\omega that (X,\sT), if \kappa-resolvable, admits an expansion \sU\supseteq\sT, with (X,\sU) Tychonoff if (X,\sT) is Tychonoff, such that (X,\sU) is \mu-resolvable for all \mu<\lambda but is not \lambda-resolvable (cf. Theorem~3.3 of \cite{comfhu10}). Here the "finite case" is addressed. The authors show in ZFC for 1<n<\omega: (a) every n-resolvable space (X,\sT) admits an exactly n-resolvable expansion \sU\supseteq\sT; (b) in some cases, even with (X,\sT) Tychonoff, no choice of \sU is available such that (X,\sU) is quasi-regular; (c) if n-resolvable, (X,\sT) admits an exactly n-resolvable quasi-regular expansion \sU if and only if either (X,\sT) is itself exactly n-resolvable and quasi-regular or (X,\sT) has a subspace which is either n-resolvable and nowhere dense or is (2n)-resolvable. In particular, every \omega-resolvable quasi-regular space admits an exactly n-resolvable quasi-regular expansion. Further, for many familiar topological properties \PP, one may choose \sU so that (X,\sU)\in\PP if (X,\sT)\in\PP.
