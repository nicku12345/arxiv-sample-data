In this paper we study the semigroup \mathscr{I}^{\infty}_\lambda of injective partial selfmaps almost everywhere the identity of a set of infinite cardinality \lambda. We describe the Green relations on \mathscr{I}^{\infty}_\lambda, all (two-sided) ideals and all congruences of the semigroup \mathscr{I}^{\infty}_\lambda. We prove that every Hausdorff hereditary Baire topology \tau on \mathscr{I}^{\infty}_\omega such that (\mathscr{I}^{\infty}_\omega,\tau) is a semitopological semigroup is discrete and describe the closure of the discrete semigroup \mathscr{I}^{\infty}_\lambda in a topological semigroup. Also we show that for an infinite cardinal \lambda the discrete semigroup \mathscr{I}^{\infty}_\lambda does not embed into a compact topological semigroup and construct two non-discrete Hausdorff topologies turning \mathscr{I}^{\infty}_\lambda into a topological inverse semigroup.
