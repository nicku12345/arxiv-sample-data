A compactum X\subset \C is unshielded if it coincides with the boundary of the unbounded component of \C\sm X. Call a compactum X finitely Suslinian if every collection of pairwise disjoint subcontinua of X whose diameters are bounded away from zero is finite. We show that any unshielded planar compactum X admits a topologically unique monotone map m_X:X \to X_{FS} onto a finitely Suslinian quotient such that any monotone map of X onto a finitely Suslinian quotient factors through m_X. We call the pair (X_{FS},m_X) (or, more loosely, X_{FS}) the finest finitely Suslinian model of X. If f:\C\to \C is a branched covering map and X \subset \C is a fully invariant compactum, then the appropriate extension M_X of m_X monotonically semiconjugates f to a branched covering map g:\C\to \C which serves as a model for f. If f is a polynomial and J_f is its Julia set, we show that m_X (or M_X) can be defined on each component Z of J_f individually as the finest monotone map of Z onto a locally connected continuum.
