The result often known as Joiner's lemma is fundamental in understanding the topology of the free topological group F(X) on a Tychonoff spaceX. In this paper, an analogue of Joiner's lemma for the free paratopological group \FP(X) on a T_1 space X is proved. Using this, it is shown that the following conditions are equivalent for a space X: (1) X is T_1; (2) \FP(X) is T_1; (3) the subspace X of \FP(X) is closed; (4) the subspace X^{-1} of \FP(X) is discrete; (5) the subspace X^{-1} is T_1; (6) the subspace X^{-1} is closed; and (7) the subspace \FP_n(X) is closed for all n \in \N, where \FP_n(X) denotes the subspace of \FP(X) consisting of all words of length at most n.
