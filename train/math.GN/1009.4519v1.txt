We construct some new cohomology theories for topological groups and Lie groups and study some of its basic properties. For example, we introduce a cohomology theory based on measurable cochains which are continuous in a neighbourhood of identity. We show that if G and A are locally compact and second countable, then the second cohomology group based on locally continuous measurable cochains as above parametrizes the collection of locally split extensions of G by A.
