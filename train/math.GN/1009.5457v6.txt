We study locally compact group topologies on semisimple Lie groups. We show that the Lie group topology on such a group S is very rigid: every 'abstract' isomorphism between S and a locally compact and \sigma-compact group \Gamma is automatically a homeomorphism, provided that S is absolutely simple. If S is complex, then non-continuous field automorphisms of the complex numbers have to be considered, but that is all.
