We study the existence of continuity points for mappings f: X\times Y\to Z whose x-sections Y\ni y\to f(x,y)\in Z are fragmentable and y-sections X\ni x\to f(x,y)\in Z are quasicontinuous, where X is a Baire space and Z is a metric space. For the factor Y, we consider two infinite "point-picking" games G_1(y) and G_2(y) defined respectively for each y\in Y as follows: In the nth inning, Player I gives a dense set D_n\subset Y, respectively, a dense open set D_n\subset Y, then Player II picks a point y_n\inD_n; II wins if y is in the closure of \{y_n:n\in\mathbb N\}, otherwise I wins. It is shown that (i) f is cliquish if II has a winning strategy in G_1(y) for every y\in Y, and (ii) f is quasicontinuous if the x-sections of f are continuous and the set of y\in Y such that II has a winning strategy in G_2(y) is dense in Y. Item (i) extends substantially a result of Debs (1986) and item (ii) indicates that the problem of Talagrand (1985) on separately continuous maps has a positive answer for a wide class of "small" compact spaces.
