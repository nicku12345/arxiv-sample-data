A topological space is locally equiconnected if there exists a neighborhood U of the diagonal in X\times X and a continuous map \lambda:U\times[0,1]\to X such that \lambda(x,y,0)=x, \lambda(x,y,1)=y et \lambda(x,x,t)=x for (x,y)\in U and (x,t)\in X\times[0,1]. This class contains all ANRs, all locally contractible topological groups and the open subsets of convex subsets of linear topological spaces. In a series of papers, we extended the fixed point theory of compact continuous maps, which was well developped for ANRs, to all separeted locally equiconnected spaces. This generalization includes a proof of Schauder's conjecture for compact maps of convex sets. This paper is a survey of that work. The generalization has two steps: the metrizable case, and the passage from the metrizable case to the general case. The metrizable case is, by far, the most difficult. To treat this case, we introduced in [4] the notion of algebraic ANR. Since the proof that metrizable locally equiconnected spaces are algebraic ANRs is rather difficult, we give here a detaled sketch of it in the case of a compact convex subset of a metrizable t.v.s.. The passage from the metrizable case to the general case uses a free functor and representations of compact spaces as inverse limits of some special inverse systems of metrizable compacta.
