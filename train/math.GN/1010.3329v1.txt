We show that every compact connected group is the limit of a continuous inverse sequence, in the category of compact groups, where each successor bonding map is either an epimorphism with finite kernel or the projection from a product by a simple compact Lie group. As an application, we present a proof of an unpublished result of Charles Mills from 1978: every compact group is supercompact.
