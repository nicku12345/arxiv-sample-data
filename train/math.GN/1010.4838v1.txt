If g is a map from a space X into \mathbb R^m and z\not\in g(X), let P_{2,1,m}(g,z) be the set of all lines \Pi^1\subset\mathbb R^m containing z such that |g^{-1}(\Pi^1)|\geq 2. We prove that for any n-dimensional metric compactum X the functions g\colon X\to\mathbb R^m, where m\geq 2n+1, with \dim P_{2,1,m}(g,z)\leq 0 for all z\not\in g(X) form a dense G_\delta-subset of the function space C(X,\mathbb R^m). A parametric version of the above theorem is also provided.
