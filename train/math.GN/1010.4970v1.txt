We give a definition of compactness in L-fuzzy topological spaces and provide a characterization of compact L-fuzzy topological spaces, where L is a complete quasi-monoidal lattice with some additional structures, and we present a version of Tychonoff's theorem within the category of L-fuzzy topological spaces.
