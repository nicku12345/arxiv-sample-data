U. H{\"o}hle and A. {\v{S}}ostak have developed in \cite{HS} the category of complete quasi-monoidal lattices; S. E. Rodabaugh in \cite{RO} proposed its opposite category and with a subcategory \mathbf{C} of the latter, he define grounds of the form \mathbf{SET\times C}. In this paper, for each ground category of the form \mathbf{SET\times C}, we study categorical frameworks for variable-basis fuzzy filters, particularly the category \mathbf{C-FFIL} of variable-basis fuzzy filters, as a natural generalization of the category of fixed-basis fuzzy filters which was introduced in \cite{LO}. In addition, we get some relations between the category of variable-basis fuzzy filters and the category of variable-basis fuzzy topological spaces.
