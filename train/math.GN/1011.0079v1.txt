In 1962, H. de Vries proved a duality theorem for the category {\bf HC} of compact Hausdorff spaces and continuous maps. The composition of the morphisms of the dual category obtained by him differs from the set-theoretic one. Here we obtain a new category dual to the category {\bf HLC} of locally compact Hausdorff spaces and continuous maps for which the composition of the morphisms is a natural one but the morphisms are multi-valued maps.
