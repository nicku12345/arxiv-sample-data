We show that: 1. Rothberger bounded subgroups of sigma-compact groups are characterized by Ramseyan partition relations. 2. For each uncountable cardinal \kappa there is a {\sf T}_0 topological group of cardinality \kappa such that ONE has a winning strategy in the point-open game on the group and the group is not a subspace of any sigma-compact space. 3. For each uncountable cardinal \kappa there is a {\sf T}_0 topological group of cardinality \kappa such that ONE has a winning strategy in the point-open game on the group and the group is \sigma-compact.
