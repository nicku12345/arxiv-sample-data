Given a family F of subsets of a group G we describe the structure of its thin-completion \tau^*(F), which is the smallest thin-complete family that contains I. A family F of subsets of G is called thin-complete if each F-thin subset of G belongs to F. A subset A of G is called F-thin if for any distinct points x,y of G the intersection xA\cap yA belongs to the family F. We prove that the thin-completion of an ideal in an ideal. If G is a countable non-torsion group, then the thin-completion \tau^*(F_G) of the ideal F_G of finite subsets of G is coanalytic but not Borel in the power-set P_G of G.
