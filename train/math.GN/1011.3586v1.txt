We prove that a Hausdorff space X is very \mathrm I-favorable if and only if X is the almost limit space of a \sigma-complete inverse system consisting of (not necessarily Hausdorff) second countable spaces and surjective d-open bonding maps. It is also shown that the class of Tychonoff very \mathrm I-favorable spaces with respect to the co-zero sets coincides with the d-openly generated spaces.
