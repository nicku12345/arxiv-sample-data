A topological group G is called an M_\omega-group if it admits a countable cover \K by closed metrizable subspaces of G such that a subset U of G is open in G if and only if U\cap K is open in K for every K\in\K. It is shown that any two non-metrizable uncountable separable zero-dimenisional M_\omega-groups are homeomorphic. Together with Zelenyuk's classification of countable k_\omega-groups this implies that the topology of a non-metrizable zero-dimensional M_\omega-group G is completely determined by its density and the compact scatteredness rank r(G) which, by definition, is equal to the least upper bound of scatteredness indices of scattered compact subspaces of G.
