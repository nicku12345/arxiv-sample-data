According to Kat\vetov (1988), for every infinite cardinal \mathfrak m satisfying {\mathfrak m}^{\mathfrak n}\leq {\mathfrak m} for all {\mathfrak n}<{\mathfrak m}, there exists a unique \mathfrak m-homogeneous universal metric space \Ur_{\mathfrak m} of weight \mathfrak m. This object generalizes the classical Urysohn universal metric space \Ur = \Ur_{\aleph_0}. We show that for \mathfrak m uncountable, the isometry group \Iso(\Urm) with the topology of simple convergence is not a universal group of weight \mathfrak m: for instance, it does not contain \Iso(\Ur) as a topological subgroup. More generally, every topological subgroup of \Iso(\Urm) having density <{\mathfrak m} and possessing the bounded orbit property (OB) is functionally balanced: right uniformly continuous bounded functions are left uniformly continuous. This stands in sharp contrast with Uspenskij's 1990 result about the group \Iso(\Ur) being a universal Polish group.
