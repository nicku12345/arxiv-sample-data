The main results of this note are: It is consistent that every subparacompact space X of size \omega_1 is a D-space; If there exists a Michael space, then all productively Lindel\"of spaces have the Menger property, and, therefore, are D-spaces; and   Every locally D-space which admits a \sigma-locally finite cover by Lindel\"of spaces is a D-space.
