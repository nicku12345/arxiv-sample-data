In this paper we consider the hyperspace C_{n}(X) of non-empty and closed subsets of a base space X with up to n connected components. We consider a class of base spaces called finite ray-graphs, which are a noncompact variation on finite graphs. We prove two results about the structure of these hyperspaces under different topologies (Hausdorff and Vietoris), in particular, about their number of connected components.
