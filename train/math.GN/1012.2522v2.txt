For a non-isolated point x of a topological space X the network character nw_\chi(x) is the smallest cardinality of a family of infinite subsets of X such that each neighborhood O(x) of x contains a set from the family. We prove that (1) each infinite compact Hausdorff space X contains a non-isolated point x with nw_\chi(x)=\aleph_0; (2) for each point x\in X with countable character there is an injective sequence in X that \F-converges to x for some meager filter \F on \omega; (3) if a functionally Hausdorff space X contains an \F-convergent injective sequence for some meager filter \F, then for every T_1-space Y that contains two non-empty open sets with disjoint closures, the function space C_p(X,Y) is meager. Also we investigate properties of filters \F admitting an injective \F-convergent sequence in \beta\omega.
