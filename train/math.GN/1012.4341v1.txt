Three philosophical principles are often quoted in connection with Leibniz: "objects sharing the same properties are the same object", "everything can possibly exist, unless it yields contradiction", "the ideal elements correctly determine the real things". Here we give a precise formulation of these principles within the framework of the Topological Extensions of [8], structures that generalize at once compactifications, completions, and nonstandard extensions. In this topological context, the above Leibniz's principles appear as a property of separation, a property of compactness, and a property of analyticity, respectively. Abiding by this interpretation, we obtain the somehow surprising conclusion that these Leibnz's principles can be fulfilled in pairs, but not all three together.
