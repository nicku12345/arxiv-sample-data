We introduce a new topological property called (*) and the corresponding class of topological spaces, which includes spaces with G_\delta-diagonals and Gruenhage spaces. Using (*), we characterise those Banach spaces which admit equivalent strictly convex norms, and give an internal topological characterisation of those scattered compact spaces K, for which the dual Banach space C(K)^* admits an equivalent strictly convex dual norm. We establish some relationships between (*) and other topological concepts, and the position of several well-known examples in this context. For instance, we show that C(\mathcal{K})^* admits an equivalent strictly convex dual norm, where \mathcal{K} is Kunen's compact space. Also, under the continuum hypothesis CH, we give an example of a compact scattered non-Gruenhage space having (*).
