A topological group (G,\mu) from a class \mathcal G of MAP topological abelian groups will be called a {\it Mackey group} in \mathcal G if it has the following property: if \nu is a group topology in G such that (G,\nu)\in \mathcal G and (G,\nu) has the same continuous characters, say (G,\nu)^{\wedge}=(G,\mu)^{\wedge}, then \nu\le \mu.   If \rm{LCS} is the class of Hausdorff topological abelian groups which admit a structure of a locally convex topological vector space over \mathbb R, it is well-known that every metrizable (G,\mu) \in \rm{LCS} is a Mackey group in \rm{LCS}. For the class \rm{LQC} of locally quasi-convex Hausdorff topological abelian groups, it was proved in 1999 that every {\bf complete} metrizable (G,\mu)\in \rm{LQC} is a Mackey group in \rm{LQC} (\cite{CMPT}). The completeness cannot be \NB dropped within the class \rm{LQC} as we prove in this paper. In fact, we provide a large family of metrizable precompact \NB(noncompact) groups which {\bf are not} Mackey groups in \rm{LQC} (Theorem \ref{basth}). Those examples are constructed from groups of the form c_0(X), whose elements are the null sequences of a topological abelian group X, and whose topology is the uniform topology. We first show that for a compact metrizable group X\ne\{0\} the topological group c_0(X) is a non-compact complete metrizable locally quasi-convex group, which has {\bf countable} topological dual iff X is connected. Then we prove that for a connected compact metrizable group X\ne\{0\} the group c_0(X) endowed with the product topology induced from the product X^{\N} is metrizable precompact but not a Mackey group in LQC.
