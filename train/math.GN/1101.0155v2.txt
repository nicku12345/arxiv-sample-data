We prove that if f\colon X\to Y is a closed surjective map between metric spaces such that every fiber f^{-1}(y) belongs to a class of space \mathrm S, then there exists an F_\sigma-set A\subset X such that A\in\mathrm S and \dim f^{-1}(y)\backslash A=0 for all y\in Y. Here, \mathrm S can be one of the following classes: (i) \{M:\mathrm{e-dim}M\leq K\} for some CW-complex K; (ii) C-spaces; (iii) weakly infinite-dimensional spaces. We also establish that if \mathrm S=\{M:\dim M\leq n\}, then \dim f\triangle g\leq 0 for almost all g\in C(X,\mathbb I^{n+1}).
