We prove the following   Theorem: Let X be a nonempty compact metrizable space, let l_1 \leq l_2 \leq... be a sequence of natural numbers, and let X_1 \subset X_2 \subset... be a sequence of nonempty closed subspaces of X such that for each k in N, dim_{Z/p} X_k \leq l_k < \infty. Then there exists a compact metrizable space Z, having closed subspaces Z_1 \subset Z_2 \subset..., and a surjective cell-like map \pi: Z \to X, such that for each k in N,   (a) dim Z_k \leq l_k,   (b) \pi (Z_k) = X_k, and   (c) \pi | {Z_k}: Z_k \to X_k is a Z/p-acyclic map.   Moreover, there is a sequence A_1 \subset A_2 \subset... of closed subspaces of Z, such that for each k, dim A_k \leq l_k, \pi|{A_k}: A_k\to X is surjective, and for k in N, Z_k\subset A_k and \pi|{A_k}: A_k\to X is a UV^{l_k-1}-map.   It is not required that X be the union of all X_k, nor that Z be the union of all Z_k. This result generalizes the Z/p-resolution theorem of A. Dranishnikov, and runs parallel to a similar theorem of S. Ageev, R. Jim\'enez, and L. Rubin, who studied the situation where the group was Z.
