Recently many papers on cone metric spaces have been appeared, and main topological properties of such spaces have been obtained. A cone metric space is Hausdorff, and first countable, so the topology of it coincides with a topology induced by an appreciate metric. In this paper the concept of a partial cone metric space is introduced, and some fixed point theorems of contractive mappings in this generalized setting are proved as well as some theorems related to topological properties. It turns out that a partial cone metric space is a topological space which is T_{0}, and some of main fixed point theorems are also valid in this generalized setting.
