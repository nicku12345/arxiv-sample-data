A Hausdorff topological group (G,\tau) is called an s-group and \tau is called an s-topology if there is a set S of sequences in G such that \tau is the finest Hausdorff group topology on G in which every sequence of S converges to the unit. The class \mathbf{S} of all s-groups contains all sequential Hausdorff groups and it is finitely multiplicative. A quotient group of an s-group is an s-group. For a non-discrete topological group (G,\tau) the following three assertions are equivalent: 1) (G,\tau) is an s-group, 2) (G,\tau) is a quotient group of a Graev free topological group over a metrizable space, 3) (G,\tau) is a quotient group of a Graev free topological group over a sequential Tychonoff space. The Abelian version of this characterization of s-groups holds as well.
