Let f be a hyperbolic transcendental entire function of finite order in the Eremenko-Lyubich class (or a finite composition of such maps), and suppose that f has a unique Fatou component. We show that the Julia set of f is a Cantor bouquet; i.e. is ambiently homeomorphic to a straight brush in the sense of Aarts and Oversteegen. In particular, we show that any two such Julia sets are ambiently homeomorphic.   We also show that if f\in\B has finite order (or is a finite composition of such maps), but is not necessarily hyperbolic, then the Julia set of f contains a Cantor bouquet.   As part of our proof, we describe, for an arbitrary function f\in\B, a natural compactification of the dynamical plane by adding a "circle of addresses" at infinity.
