Using a factorization theorem due to Pasynkov we provide a short proof of the existence and density of parametric Bing and Krasinkiewicz maps. In particular, the following corollary is established: Let f\colon X\to Y be a surjective map between paracompact spaces such that all fibers f^{-1}(y), y\in Y, are compact and there exists a map g\colon X\to\mathbb I^{\aleph_0} embedding each f^{-1}(y) into \mathbb I^{\aleph_0}. Then for every n\geq 1 the space C^*(X,\mathbb R^n) of all bounded continuous functions with the uniform convergence topology contains a dense set of maps g such that any restriction g|f^{-1}(y), y\in Y, is a Bing and Krasinkiewicz map.
