We present a wide class of reflexive, precompact, non-compact, Abelian topological groups G determined by three requirements. They must have the Baire property, satisfy the \textit{open refinement condition}, and contain no infinite compact subsets. This combination of properties guarantees that all compact subsets of the dual group G^\wedge are finite. We also show that many (non-reflexive) precompact Abelian groups are quotients of reflexive precompact Abelian groups. This includes all precompact almost metrizable groups with the Baire property and their products. Finally, given a compact Abelian group G of weight \geq 2^\om, we find proper dense subgroups H_1 and H_2 of G such that H_1 is reflexive and pseudocompact, while H_2 is non-reflexive and almost metrizable.
