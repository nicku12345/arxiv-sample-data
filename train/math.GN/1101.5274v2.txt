Let X be a Hausdorff topological vector space, X^* its topological dual and Z a subset of X^*. In this paper, we establish some results concerning the \sigma(X,Z)-approximate fixed point property for bounded, closed convex subsets C of X. Three major situations are studied. First when Z is separable in the strong topology. Second when X is a metrizable locally convex space and Z=X^*, and third when X is not necessarily metrizable but admits a metrizable locally convex topology compatible with the duality. Our approach focuses on establishing the Fr\'echet-Urysohn property for certain sets with regarding the \sigma(X,Z)-topology. The support tools include the Brouwer's fixed point theorem and an analogous version of the classical Rosenthal's \ell_1-theorem for \ell_1-sequences in metrizable case. The results are novel and generalize previous work obtained by the authors in Banach spaces.
