The n-dimensional affine group over the integers is the group \mathcal G_n of all affinities on \mathbb R^{n} which leave the lattice  \mathbb Z^{n} invariant. \mathcal G_n yields a geometry in the classical sense of the Erlangen Program. In this paper we construct a \mathcal G_n-invariant measure on rational polyhedra in \mathbb R^n, i.e., finite unions of simplexes with rational vertices in \mathbb R^n, and prove its uniqueness. Our main tool is given by the Morelli-W{\l}odarczyk factorization of birational toric maps in blow-ups and blow-downs (solution of the weak Oda conjecture).
