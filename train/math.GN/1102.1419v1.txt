We prove that every TVS-cone metric space (i.e a cone metric space over a locally convex topological vector space E) is first countable paracompact topological space and by using Du's results in " [A note on cone metric fixed point theory and its equivalence, {Nonlinear Analysis},72(5),2259-2261 (2010)]", we conclude that every TVS-cone metric space is topologically isomorphic to a topological metric space. We also show how to construct comparable metric topologies to TVS-cone metric topologies by using the system of seminorms generating the topology of the locally convex topological vector space E. When E is a Banach space these metric topologies turn to be equivalent to the original TVS-cone metric topologies. Even though, we remark that there are still some fixed point theorems to deal nontrivially with them in TVS-cone metric spaces. The nonlinear scalarization is used also to prove some fixed point theorems with nonlinear contractive conditions.
