In this paper, the class of all linearly ordered topological spaces (LOTS) quasi-ordered by the embeddability relation is investigated. In ZFC it is proved that for countable LOTS this quasi-order has both a maximal (universal) element and a finite basis. For the class of uncountable LOTS of cardinality \kappa it is proved that this quasi-order has no maximal element for \kappa at least the size of the continuum and that in fact the dominating number for such quasi-orders is maximal, i.e. 2^\kappa. Certain subclasses of LOTS, such as the separable LOTS, are studied with respect to the top and internal structure of their respective embedding quasi-order. The basis problem for uncountable LOTS is also considered; assuming the Proper Forcing Axiom there is an eleven element basis for the class of uncountable LOTS and a six element basis for the class of dense uncountable LOTS in which all points have countable cofinality and coinitiality.
