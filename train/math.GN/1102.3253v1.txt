Let X be a Borel subset of the Cantor set \textbf{C} of additive or multiplicative class {\alpha}, and f: X \to Y be a continuous function with compact preimages of points onto Y \subset \textbf{C}. If the image f(U) of every clopen set U is the intersection of an open and a closed set, then Y is a Borel set of the same class. This result generalizes similar results for open and closed functions.
