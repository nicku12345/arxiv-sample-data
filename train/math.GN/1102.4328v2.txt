A family \mathcal N of closed subsets of a topological space X is called a {\em closed k-network} if for each open set U\subset X and a compact subset K\subset U there is a finite subfamily \mathcal F\subset\mathcal N with K\subset\bigcup\F\subset \mathcal N. A compact space X is called {\em supercompact} if it admits a closed k-network \mathcal N which is {\em binary} in the sense that each linked subfamily \mathcal L\subset\mathcal N is centered. A closed k-network \mathcal N in a topological group G is {\em invariant} if xAy\in\mathcal N for each A\in\mathcal N and x,y\in G. According to a result of Kubi\'s and Turek, each compact (abelian) topological group admits an (invariant) binary closed k-network. In this paper we prove that the compact topological groups S^3 and \SO(3) admit no invariant binary closed k-network.
