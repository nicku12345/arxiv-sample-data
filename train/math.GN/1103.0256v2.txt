The KC property, a separation axiom between weakly Hausdorff and Hausdorff, requires compact subsets to be closed. Various assumptions involving local conditions, dimension, connectivity, and homotopy show certain KC-spaces are in fact Hausdorff. Several low dimensional examples of compact, connected, non-Hausdorff KC-spaces are exhibited in which the nested intersection of compact connected subsets fails to be connected.
