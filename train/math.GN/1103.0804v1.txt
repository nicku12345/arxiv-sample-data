We prove that for a compact subgroup H of a locally compact Hausdorff group G, the following properties are mutually equivalent: (1) G/H is a manifold, (2) G/H is finite-dimensional and locally connected, (3) G/H is locally contractible, (4) G/H is an ANE for paracompact spaces, (5) G/H is a metrizable G-ANE for paracompact proper G-spaces having a paracompact orbit space. A new version of the Approximate slice theorem is also proven in the light of these results.
