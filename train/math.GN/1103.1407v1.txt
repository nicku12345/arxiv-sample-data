Let X be a Hausdorff topological group and G a locally compact subgroup of X. We show that X admits a locally finite \sigma-discrete G-functionally open cover each member of which is G-homeomorphic to a twisted product G\times_H S_i, where H is a compact large subgroup of G (i.e., the quotient G/H is a manifold). If, in addition, the space of connected components of G is compact and X is normal, then X itself is G-homeomorphic to a twisted product G\times_KS, where K is a maximal compact subgroup of G. This implies that X is K-homeomorphic to the product G/K\times S, and in particular, X is homeomorphic to the product \Bbb R^n\times S, where n={\rm dim\,} G/K. Using these results we prove the inequality  {\rm dim}\, X\le {\rm dim}\, X/G + {\rm dim}\, G for every Hausdorff topological group X and a locally compact subgroup G of X.
