We consider amalgamation properties of convergent sequences in topological groups and topological vector spaces. The main result of this paper is that, for arbitrary topological groups, Nyikos's property \alpha_{1.5} is equivalent to Arhangel'ski\u{\i}'s formally stronger property \alpha_1. This result solves a problem of Shakhmatov (2002), and its proof uses a new perturbation argument. We also prove that there is a topological space X such that the space C_p(X) of continuous real-valued functions on X, with the topology of pointwise convergence, has Arhangel'ski\u{\i}'s property \alpha_1 but is not countably tight. This result follows from results of Arhangel'ski\u{\i}--Pytkeev, Moore and Todor\v{c}evi\'c, and provides a new solution, with remarkable properties, to a problem of Averbukh and Smolyanov (1968) concerning topological vector spaces. The Averbukh--Smolyanov problem was first solved by Plichko (2009), using Banach spaces with weaker locally convex topologies.
