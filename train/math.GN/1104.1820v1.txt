We prove that for a compact subgroup H of an almost connected locally compact Hausdorff group G, the following properties are mutually equivalent: (1) H is a maximal compact subgroup of G, (2) G/H is contractible, (3) G/H is homeomorphic to a Euclidean space, (4) G/H is an AE for paracompact spaces, (5) G/H is a G-AE for paracompact proper G-spaces having a paracompact orbit space.
