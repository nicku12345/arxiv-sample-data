In answer to a question of A. Blass, J. Irwin and G. Schlitt, a subgroup G of the additive group Z^{\omega} is constructed whose dual, Hom(G,Z), is free abelian of rank 2^{\aleph_0}. The question of whether Z^{\omega} has subgroups whose duals are free of still larger rank is discussed, and some further classes of subgroups of Z^{\omega} are noted.
