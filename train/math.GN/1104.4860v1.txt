The \mathbb{G}_0-dichotomy due to Kechris, Solecki and Todor\vcevi\'c characterizes the analytic relations having a Borel-measurable countable coloring. We give a version of the \mathbb{G}_0-dichotomy for \boraxi-measurable countable colorings when \xi\leq 3. A \boraxi-measurable countable coloring gives a covering of the diagonal consisting of countably many \boraxi squares. This leads to the study of countable unions of \boraxi rectangles. We also give a Hurewicz-like dichotomy for such countable unions when \xi\leq 2.
