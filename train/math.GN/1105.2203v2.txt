A topological group X is called connected if the only subsets which are both open and closed are the whole space X and the null set \emptyset. A subset of a topological group is connected if the subspace is connected. We say that a subset A of X is G-sequentially connected if the only subsets of A which are both G-sequentially open and G-sequentially closed, with respect to the relative G-sequentially open and G-sequentially closed subsets of A, are open and closed subsets of A are A and the null set, \emptyset. We investigate the impact of changing the definition of convergence of sequences on the structure of sequential connectedness of subsets of X via sequential closure of sets in the sense of G-sequential closure. Sequential connectedness for topological groups is a special case of this generalization when G = lim.
