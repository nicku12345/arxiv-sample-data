In our earlier papers we constructed examples of 2-dimensional nonaspherical simply-connected cell-like Peano continua, called {\sl Snake space}. In the sequel we introduced the functor SC(-,-) defined on the category of all spaces with base points and continuous mappings. For the circle S^1, the space SC(S^1, \ast) is a Snake space. In the present paper we study the higher-dimensional homology and homotopy properties of the spaces SC(Z, \ast) for any path-connected compact spaces Z.
