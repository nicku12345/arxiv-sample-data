A type-2 computable real function is necessarily continuous; and this remains true for relative, i.e. oracle-based computations. Conversely, by the Weierstrass Approximation Theorem, every continuous f:[0,1]->R is computable relative to some oracle.   In their search for a similar topological characterization of relatively computable multivalued functions f:[0,1]=>R (aka relations), Brattka and Hertling (1994) have considered two notions: weak continuity (which is weaker than relative computability) and strong continuity (which is stronger than relative computability). Observing that uniform continuity plays a crucial role in the Weierstrass Theorem, we propose and compare several notions of uniform continuity for relations. Here, due to the additional quantification over values y in f(x), new ways of (linearly) ordering quantifiers arise, yet none of them turn out as satisfactory.   We are thus led to a notion of uniform continuity based on the Henkin Quantifier; and prove it necessary for relative computability. In fact iterating this condition yields a strict hierarchy of notions each necessary, and the omega-th level also sufficient, for relative computability.
