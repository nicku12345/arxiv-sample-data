Torus leaves play a crucial role in the theory of foliations. For example non-taut foliations admit a torus leaf (see the article of Goodman). In this paper, we study all the foliations near a torus leaf, and try to understand why sometimes it is taut, or non-taut (and Reebless). We focus on some crucial examples to understand non-taut and Reebless foliations; and foliations admitting a non-separating torus leaf. It relies on the study of turbulization and spiraling, with generalizations.
