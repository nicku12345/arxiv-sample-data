Let p:X\rightarrow X/A be a quotient map, where A is a subspace of X. We explore conditions under which p_*(\pi_1^{qtop}(X,x_0)) is dense in \pi_1^{qtop}(X/A,*)), where the fundamental groups enjoy the natural quotient topology inherited from the loop space and p_* is the induced continuous homomorphism by the quotient map p. Also, we give some applications to find out some properties for \pi_1^{qtop}(X/A,*). In particular, we give some conditions in which \pi_1^{qtop}(X/A,*) is an indiscrete topological group.
