We describe the supports of a class of real-valued maps on C*(X) introduced by Radul. Using this description, a characterization of compact-valued retracts of a given space in terms of functional extenders is obtained. For example, if X\subset Y, then there exists a continuous compact-valued retraction from Y onto X if and only if there exists a normed weakly additive extender u\colon C*(X)\to C*(Y) with compact supports preserving \min (resp., \max) and weakly preserving \max (resp., \min). Similar characterizations are obtained for upper (resp., lower) semi-continuous compact-valued retractions. These results provide characterizations of (not necessarily compact) absolute extensors for zero-dimensional spaces, as well as absolute extensors for one-dimensional spaces, involving non-linear functional extenders.
