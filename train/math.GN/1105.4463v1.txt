In this paper a generalization of Urysohn's metrization theorem is given for higher cardinals. Namely, it is shown that a topological space with a basis of cardinality at most |\omega_\mu| or smaller is \omega_\mu-metrizable if and only if it is \omega_\mu-additive and regular, or, equivalently, \omega_\mu-additive, zero-dimensional, and T\textsubscript{0}. Furthermore, all such spaces are shown to be embeddable in a suitable generalization of Hilbert's cube.
