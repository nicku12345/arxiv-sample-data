Given a sequence converging to zero, we consider the set of numbers which are sums of (infinite, finite, or empty) subsequences. When the original sequence is not absolutely summable, the subsum set is an unbounded closed interval which includes zero. When it is absolutely summable the subsum set is one of the following: a finite union of (nontrivial) compact intervals, a Cantor set, or a "symmetric Cantorval".
