A topological space G is said to be a {\it rectifiable space} provided that there are a surjective homeomorphism \phi :G\times G\rightarrow G\times G and an element e\in G such that \pi_{1}\circ \phi =\pi_{1} and for every x\in G we have \phi (x, x)=(x, e), where \pi_{1}: G\times G\rightarrow G is the projection to the first coordinate. In this paper, we mainly discuss the rectifiable spaces which are suborderable, and show that if a rectifiable space is suborderable then it is metrizable or a totally disconnected P-space, which improves a theorem of A.V. Arhangel'ski\v\i\ in \cite{A20092}. As an applications, we discuss the remainders of the Hausdorff compactifications of GO-spaces which are rectifiable, and we mainly concerned with the following statement, and under what condition \Phi it is true.   Statement: Suppose that G is a non-locally compact GO-space which is rectifiable, and that Y=bG\setminus G has (locally) a property-\Phi. Then G and bG are separable and metrizable.   Moreover, we also consieder some related matters about the remainders of the Hausdorff compactifications of rectifiable spaces.
