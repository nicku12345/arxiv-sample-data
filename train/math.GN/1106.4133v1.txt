In this paper,\ the authors define a space with an uniform base at non-isolated points, give some characterizations of images of metric spaces by boundary-compact maps, and study certain relationship among spaces with special base properties.\ The main results are the following: (1)\ X is an open,\ boundary-compact image of a metric space if and only if X has an uniform base at non-isolated points; (2)\ Each discretizable space of a space with an uniform base is an open compact and at most boundary-one image of a space with an uniform base; (3)\ X has a point-countable base if and only if X is a bi-quotient,\ at most boundary-one and countable-to-one image of a metric space.
