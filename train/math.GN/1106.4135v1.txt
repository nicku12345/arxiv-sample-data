In this paper, the authors mainly discuss the images of spaces with an uniform base at non-isolated points, and obtain the following main results: (1)\ Perfect maps preserve spaces with an uniform base at non-isolated points; (2)\ Open and closed maps preserve regular spaces with an uniform base at non-isolated points; (3)\ Spaces with an uniform base at non-isolated points don't satisfy the decomposition theorem.
