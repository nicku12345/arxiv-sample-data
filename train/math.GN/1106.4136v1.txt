In this paper, we mainly introduce the notion of an open uniform (G) at non-isolated points, and show that a space X has an open uniform (G) at non-isolated points if and only if X is the open boundary-compact image of metric spaces. Moreover, we also discuss the inverse image of spaces with an open uniform (G) at non-isolated points. Two questions about open uniform (G) at non-isolated points are posed.
