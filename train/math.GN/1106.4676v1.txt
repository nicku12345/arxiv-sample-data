Let (X,\rho) be a metric space and (CL(X),W_\rho) be the hyperspace of all nonempty closed subsets of X equipped with the Wijsman topology. The Wijsman topology is one of the most important classical hyperspace topologies. We give a partial answer to a question posed in \cite{maio} whether the normality of (CL(X),W_\rho) is equivalent to its metrizability. If (X,\rho) is a linear metric space, then (CL(X),W_\rho) is normal if and only if (CL(X),W_\rho) is metrizable. Some further results concerning normality of the Wijsman topology on CL(X) are also proved.
