The purpose of this article is to formulate conjectural generalizations of Hindman's Theorem and Ellis's Lemma for nonassociative binary systems and relate them to the amenability problem for Thompson's group F. Partial results are obtained for both conjectures. The paper will also contain some general analysis of the conjectures.
