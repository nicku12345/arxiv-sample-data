We prove that, for an arbitrary topological space X, the following two conditions are equivalent: (a) Every open cover of X has a finite subset with dense union (b) X is D-pseudocompact, for every ultrafilter D.   Locally, our result asserts that if X is weakly initially \lambda-compact, and 2^ \mu \leq \lambda , then X is D-\brfrt pseudocompact, for every ultrafilter D over any set of cardinality  \leq \mu. As a consequence, if 2^ \mu \leq \lambda , then the product of any family of weakly initially \lambda-compact spaces is weakly initially \mu-compact.
