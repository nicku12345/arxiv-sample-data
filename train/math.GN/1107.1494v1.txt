The aim of the paper is to prove that if M is a metrizable manifold modelled on a Hilbert space of dimension \alpha \geq \aleph_0 and F is its \sigma-Z-set, then for every completely metrizable space X of weight no greater than \alpha and its closed subset A, for any map f: X \to M, each open cover \mathcal{U} of M and a sequnce (A_n)_n of closed subsets of X disjoint from A there is a map g: X \to M \mathcal{U}-homotopic to f such that g\bigr|_A = f\bigr|_A, g\bigr|_{A_n} is a closed embedding for each n and g(X \setminus A) is a \sigma-Z-set in M disjoint from F. It is shown that if f(\partial A) is contained in a locally closed \sigma-Z-set in M or f(X \setminus A) \cap \bar{f(\partial A)} = \empty, the map g may be taken so that g\bigr|_{X \setminus A} be an embedding. If, in addition, X \setminus A is a connected manifold modelled on the same Hilbert space as M and \bar{f(\partial A)} is a Z-set in M, then there is a \mathcal{U}-homotopic to f map h: X \to M such that h\bigr|_A = f\bigr|_A and h\bigr|_{X \setminus A} is an open embedding.
