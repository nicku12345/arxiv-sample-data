For a metrizable space X and a finite measure space (\Omega,\mathfrak{M},\mu) let M_{\mu}(X) and M^f_{\mu}(X) be the spaces of all equivalence classes (under the relation of equality almost everywhere mod \mu) of mathfrak{M}-measurable functions from \Omega to X whose images are separable and finite, respectively, equipped with the topology of convergence in measure. The main aim of the paper is to prove the following result: if \mu is (nonzero and) nonatomic and X has more than one point, then the space M_{\mu}(X) is a noncompact absolute retract and M^f_{\mu}(A) is homotopy dense in M_{\mu}(X) for each dense subset A of X. In particular, if X is completely metrizable, then M_{\mu}(X) is homeomorphic to an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space.
