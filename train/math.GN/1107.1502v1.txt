Most of results of Bestvina and Mogilski [\textit{Characterizing certain incomplete infinite-dimensional absolute retracts}, Michigan Math. J. \textbf{33} (1986), 291--313] on strong Z-sets in ANR's and absorbing sets is generalized to nonseparable case. It is shown that if an ANR X is locally homotopy dense embeddable in infinite-dimensional Hilbert manifolds and w(U) = w(X) (where `w' is the topological weight) for each open nonempty subset U of X,then X itself is homotopy dense embeddable in a Hilbert manifold. It is also demonstrated that whenever X is an AR, its weak product W(X,*) = \{(x_n)_{n=1}^{\infty} \in X^{\omega}:\ x_n = * \textup{for almost all} n\} is homeomorphic to a pre-Hilbert space E with E \cong \Sigma E. An intrinsic characterization of manifolds modelled on such pre-Hilbert spaces is given.
