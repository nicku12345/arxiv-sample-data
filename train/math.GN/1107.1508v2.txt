It is shown that if for a complete metric space (X,d) there is a constant \epsilon > 0 such that the intersection \bigcap_{j=1}^n B_d(x_j,r_j) of open balls is nonempty for every finite system x_1,...,x_n \in X of centers and a corresponding system of radii r_1,...,r_n > 0 such that d(x_j,x_k) \leqsl \epsilon and d(x_j,x_k) < r_j + r_k (j,k = 1,...,n), then X is an ANR; and if in the above one may put \epsilon = \infty, the space X is an AR. A certain criterion for an incomplete metric space to be an A(N)R is presented.
