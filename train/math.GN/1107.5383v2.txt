We introduce a natural generalization of Borel's Conjecture. For each infinite cardinal number \kappa, let {\sf BC}_{\kappa} denote this generalization. Then {\sf BC}_{\aleph_0} is equivalent to the classical Borel conjecture. Assuming the classical Borel conjecture, \neg{\sf BC}_{\aleph_1} is equivalent to the existence of a Kurepa tree of height \aleph_1. Using the connection of {\sf BC}_{\kappa} with a generalization of Kurepa's Hypothesis, we obtain the following consistency results:   (1)If it is consistent that there is a 1-inaccessible cardinal then it is consistent that {\sf BC}_{\aleph_1}.   (2)If it is consistent that {\sf BC}_{\aleph_1} holds, then it is consistent that there is an inaccessible cardinal.   (3)If it is consistent that there is a 1-inaccessible cardinal with \omega inaccessible cardinals above it, then \neg{\sf BC}_{\aleph_{\omega}} \, +\, (\forall n<\omega){\sf BC}_{\aleph_n} is consistent.   (4)If it is consistent that there is a 2-huge cardinal, then it is consistent that {\sf BC}_{\aleph_{\omega}}.   (5)If it is consistent that there is a 3-huge cardinal, then it is consistent that {\sf BC}_{\kappa} holds for a proper class of cardinals \kappa of countable cofinality.
