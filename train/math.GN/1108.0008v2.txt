We give here some precisions and improvements about the validity of the explicit reconstruction of any holomorphic function on a ball of \mathbb{C}^2 from its restrictions on a family of complex lines. Such validity depends on the mutual distribution of the lines. This condition can be geometrically described and is equivalent to a stronger stability of the reconstruction formula in terms of permutations and subfamilies of these lines. The motivation of this problem comes from possible applications in mathematical economics and medical imaging.
