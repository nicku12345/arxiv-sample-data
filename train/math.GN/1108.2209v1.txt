Let F be a countable family of rational functions of two variables with real coefficients. Each rational function f\in F can be thought as a continuous function f:dom(f)\to\bar R taking values in the projective line \bar R=R\cup\{\infty\} and defined on a cofinite subset dom(f) of the torus \bar R^2. Then the family \F determines a continuous vector-function F:dom(F)\to\bar R^F defined on the dense G_\delta-set dom(F)=\bigcap_{f\in F}dom(F) of \bar R^2. The closure \bar\Gamma(F) of its graph \Gamma(F)=\{(x,f(x)):x\in dom(F)\} in \bar R^2\times\bar R^F is called the {\em graphoid} of the family F. We prove the graphoid \bar\Gamma(F) has topological dimension dim(\bar\Gamma(F))=2. If the family F contains all linear fractional transformations f(x,y)=\frac{x-a}{y-b} for (a,b)\in Q^2, then the graphoid \bar\Gamma(F) has cohomological dimension dim_G(\bar\Gamma(F))=1 for any non-trivial 2-divisible abelian group G. Hence the space \bar\Gamma(F) is a natural example of a compact space that is not dimensionally full-valued and by this property resembles the famous Pontryagin surface.
