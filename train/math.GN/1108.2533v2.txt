Using the property of being completely Baire, countable dense homogeneity and the perfect set property we will be able, under Martin's Axiom for countable posets, to distinguish non-principal ultrafilters on \omega up to homeomorphism. Here, we identify ultrafilters with subpaces of 2^\omega in the obvious way. Using the same methods, still under Martin's Axiom for countable posets, we will construct a non-principal ultrafilter \UU\subseteq 2^\omega such that \UU^\omega is countable dense homogeneous. This consistently answers a question of Hru\v{s}\'ak and Zamora Avil\'es. Finally, we will give some partial results about the relation of such topological properties with the combinatorial property of being a \mathrm{P}-point.
