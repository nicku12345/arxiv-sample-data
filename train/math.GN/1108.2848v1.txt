In this paper we study the semigroup \mathscr{I}_{\infty}^{\nearrow}(\mathbb{N}) of partial cofinal monotone bijective transformations of the set of positive integers \mathbb{N}. We show that the semigroup \mathscr{I}_{\infty}^{\nearrow}(\mathbb{N}) has algebraic properties similar to the bicyclic semigroup: it is bisimple and all of its non-trivial group homomorphisms are either isomorphisms or group homomorphisms. We also prove that every locally compact topology \tau on \mathscr{I}_{\infty}^{\nearrow}(\mathbb{N}) such that (\mathscr{I}_{\infty}^{\nearrow}(\mathbb{N}),\tau) is a topological inverse semigroup, is discrete. Finally, we describe the closure of (\mathscr{I}_{\infty}^{\nearrow}(\mathbb{N}),\tau) in a topological semigroup.
