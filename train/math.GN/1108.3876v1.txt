We contribute some information towards finding a general algorithm for constructing, for a given profinite group, G, a compact connected space, X, such that the full homeomorphism group, H(X), with the compact-open topology is isomorphic to G as a topological group. It is proposed that one should find a compact topological oriented graph \Gamma such that G\cong Aut(\Gamma). The replacement of the edges of \Gamma by rigid continua should work as is exemplified in various instances where discrete graphs were used. It is shown here that the strategy can be implemented for profinite monothetic groups G.
