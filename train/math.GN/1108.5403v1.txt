In this note we give sufficient conditions to ensure that the weak Finsler structure of a complete C^k Finsler manifold M is determined by the normed algebra C_b^k(M) of all real-valued, bounded and C^k smooth functions with bounded derivative defined on M. As a consequence, we obtain: (i) the Finsler structure of a finite-dimensional and complete C^k Finsler manifold M is determined by the algebra C_b^k(M); (ii) the weak Finsler structure of a separable and complete C^k Finsler manifold M modeled on a Banach space with a Lipschitz and C^k smooth bump function is determined by the algebra C^k_b(M); (iii) the weak Finsler structure of a C^k uniformly bumpable and complete C^k Finsler manifold M modeled on a Weakly Compactly Generated (WCG) Banach space with an (equivalent) C^k smooth norm is determined by the algebra C^k_b(M); and (iii) the isometric structure of a WCG Banach space X with an C^1 smooth bump function is determined by the algebra C_b^1(X).
