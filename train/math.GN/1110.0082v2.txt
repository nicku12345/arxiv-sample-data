We mainly discuss the cardinal invariants and generalized metric properties on paratopological groups or rectifiable spaces, and show that: (1) If A and B are \omega-narrow subsets of a paratopological group G, then AB is \omega-narrow in G, which give an affirmative answer for \cite[Open problem 5.1.9]{A2008}; (2) Every bisequential or weakly first-countable rectifiable space is metrizable; (3) The properties of Fr\acute{e}chet-Urysohn and strongly Fr\acute{e}chet-Urysohn are coincide in rectifiable spaces; (4) Every rectifiable space G contains a (closed) copy of S_{\omega} if and only if G has a (closed) copy of S_{2}; (5) If a rectifiable space G has a \sigma-point-discrete closed k-network, then G contains no closed copy of S_{\omega_{1}}; (6) If a rectifiable space G is pointwise canonically weakly pseudocompact, then G is a Moscow space. Also, we consider the remainders of paratopological groups or rectifiable spaces, and give a partial answer to questions posed by C. Liu in \cite{Liu2009} and C. Liu, S. Lin in \cite{Liu20091}, respectively.
