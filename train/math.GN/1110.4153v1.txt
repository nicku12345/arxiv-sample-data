We investigate the structure of the Tukey types of ultrafilters on countable sets partially ordered by reverse inclusion. A canonization of cofinal maps from a p-point into another ultrafilter is obtained. This is used in particular to study the Tukey types of p-points and selective ultrafilters. Results fall into three main categories: comparison to a basis element for selective ultrafilters, embeddings of chains and antichains into the Tukey types, and Tukey types generated by block-basic ultrafilters on FIN.
