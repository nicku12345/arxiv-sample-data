An ultrafilter \mathcal{U} on a countable base {\em has continuous Tukey reductions} if whenever an ultrafilter \mathcal{V} is Tukey reducible to \mathcal{U}, then every monotone cofinal map f:\mathcal{U}\ra\mathcal{V} is continuous when restricted to some cofinal subset of \mathcal{U}.   In the first part of the paper, we give mild conditions under which the property of having continuous Tukey reductions is inherited under Tukey reducibility. In particular, if \mathcal{U} is Tukey reducible to a p-point then \mathcal{U} has continuous Tukey reductions. In the second part, we show that any countable iteration of Fubini products of p-points has Tukey reductions which are continuous with respect to its topological Ramsey space of \vec{\mathcal{U}}-trees.
