Extending and unifying concepts extensively used in the literature, we introduce the notion of approximable interpolation sets for algebras of functions on locally compact groups, especially for weakly almost periodic functions and for uniformly continuous functions. We characterize approximable interpolation sets both in combinatorial terms and in terms of the \mathscr{LUC}- and \mathscr{WAP}-compactifications and analyze some of their properties.
