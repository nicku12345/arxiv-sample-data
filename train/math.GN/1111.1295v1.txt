Using the structure of the Boson-Fermion Fock space and an argument taken from [2], we give a new proof of the triviality of the L^2 cohomology groups on an abstract Wiener space, alternative to that given by Shigekawa [9]. We apply some representation theory of the symmetric group to characterise the spaces of exact and co-exact forms in their Boson-Fermion Fock space representation.
