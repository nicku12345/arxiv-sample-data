Motivated by a Tukey classification problem we develop here a new topological Ramsey space \mathcal{R}_1 that in its complexity comes immediately after the classical is a natural Ellentuck space \cite{MR0349393}. Associated with \mathcal{R}_1 is an ultrafilter \mathcal{U}_1 which is weakly Ramsey but not Ramsey. We prove a canonization theorem for equivalence relations on fronts on \mathcal{R}_1. This is analogous to the Pudlak-\Rodl\ Theorem canonizing equivalence relations on barriers on the Ellentuck space. We then apply our canonization theorem to completely classify all Rudin-Keisler equivalence classes of ultrafilters which are Tukey reducible to \mathcal{U}_1: Every ultrafilter which is Tukey reducible to \mathcal{U}_1 is isomorphic to a countable iteration of Fubini products of ultrafilters from among a fixed countable collection of ultrafilters. Moreover, we show that there is exactly one Tukey type of nonprincipal ultrafilters strictly below that of \mathcal{U}_1, namely the Tukey type a Ramsey ultrafilter.
