We show that there exists a canonical topology, naturally connected with the causal site of J. D. Christensen and L. Crane, a pointless algebraic structure motivated by quantum gravity. Taking a causal site compatible with Minkowski space, on every compact subset our topology became a reconstruction of the original topology of the spacetime (only from its causal structure). From the global point of view, the reconstructed topology is the de Groot dual or co-compact with respect to the original, Euclidean topology. The result indicates that the causality is the primary structure of the spacetime, carrying also its topological information.
