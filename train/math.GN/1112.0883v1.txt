We show that if X has a zero-set diagonal and X^2 has countable weak extent, then X is submetrizable. This generalizes earlier results from Martin and Buzyakova. Furthermore we show that if X has a regular G_\delta-diagonal and X^2 has countable weak extent, then X condenses onto a second countable Hausdorff space. We also prove several cardinality bounds involving various types of diagonal degree.
