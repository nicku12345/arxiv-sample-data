For any topological group G the dual object \hat G is defined as the set of equivalence classes of irreducible unitary representations of G equipped with the Fell topology. If G is compact, \hat G is discrete, and we investigate to what extent this remains true for precompact groups, i.e. for dense subgroups of compact groups. We find that: (a) if G is a metrizable precompact group, then \hat G is discrete; (b) if G is a countable non-metrizable precompact group, then \hat G is not discrete; (c) every non-metrizable compact group contains a dense subgroup G for which \hat G is not discrete. This generalizes to the non-Abelian case what was known for Abelian groups.   Kazhdan's property (T) can be defined in similar terms, but we must consider representations without non-zero invariant vectors rather than irreducible representations. If G is any countable Abelian precompact group, then G does not have property (T), although \hat G is discrete if G is metrizable.
