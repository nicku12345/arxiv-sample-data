Let f : X \lo Y be a map of compact metric spaces. A classical theorem of Hurewicz asserts that \dim X \leq \dim Y +\dim f where \dim f =\sup \{\dim f^{-1}(y): y \in Y \}. The first author conjectured that {\em \dim Y + \dim f in Hurewicz's theorem can be replaced by \sup \{\dim (Y \times f^{-1}(y)): y \in Y \}}. We disprove this conjecture. As a by-product of the machinery presented in the paper we answer in negative the following problem posed by the first author: {\em Can for compact X the Menger-Urysohn formula \dim X \leq \dim A + \dim B +1 be improved to \dim X \leq \dim (A \times B) +1 ?}   On a positive side we show that both conjectures holds true for compacta X satisfying the equality dim(X\times X)=2\dim X.
