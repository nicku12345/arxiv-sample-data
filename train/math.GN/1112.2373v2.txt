For a set X\sbst\R, let B(X)\sbst\R^X denote the space of Borel real-valued functions on X, with the topology inherited from the Tychonoff product \R^X. Assume that for each countable A\sbst B(X), each f in the closure of A is in the closure of A under pointwise limits of sequences of partial functions. We show that in this case, B(X) is countably Fr\'echet--Urysohn, that is, each point in the closure of a countable set is a limit of a sequence of elements of that set. This solves a problem of Arnold Miller. The continuous version of this problem is equivalent to a notorious open problem of Gerlits and Nagy. Answering a question of Salvador Herna\'ndez, we show that the same result holds for the space of all Baire class 1 functions on X.   We conjecture that, in the general context, the answer to the continuous version of this problem is negative, but we identify a nontrivial context where the problem has a positive solution.   The proofs establish new local-to-global correspondences, and use methods of infinite-combinatorial topology, including a new fusion result of Francis Jordan.
