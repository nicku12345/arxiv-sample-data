A new framework for information hiding security, called topological-security, has been proposed in a previous study. It is based on the evaluation of unpredictability of the scheme, whereas existing notions of security, as stego-security, are more linked to information leaks. It has been proven that spread-spectrum techniques, a well-known stego-secure scheme, are topologically-secure too. In this paper, the links between the two notions of security is deepened and the usability of topological-security is clarified, by presenting a novel data hiding scheme that is twice stego and topological-secure. This last scheme has better scores than spread-spectrum when evaluating qualitative and quantitative topological-security properties. Incidentally, this result shows that the new framework for security tends to improve the ability to compare data hiding scheme.
