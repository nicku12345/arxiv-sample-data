S.A. Solovyov (2008) has recently introduced the notion of a Q-topological space (and Q-continuous maps between them), where Q is a fixed member of a variety of Omega-algebras, which in turn gives rise to the category Q-TOP of such spaces. The purpose of this note is to give a characterization of this category (in a large class of categories), in terms of a 'Sierpinski-like' object, which is similar to the one given by E.G. Manes in 1976 for the category TOP of topological spaces.
