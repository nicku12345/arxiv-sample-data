A S(n)-space is S(n)-functionally compact (S(n)FC) if every continuous function onto a S(n)-space is closed. S(n)-closed, S(n)-{\theta}-closed, minimal S(n) and S(n)FC spaces are characterized in terms of {\theta}(n)-complete accumulation points. In paper we also give new characteristics of R-closed and regular functionally compact spaces. Results obtained to answer some questions raised by D.Dikranjan, E.Giuli, L.Friedler, M.Girou, D.Pettey and J.Porter.
