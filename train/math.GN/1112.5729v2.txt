Given a set X and a family G of self-maps of X, we study the problem of the existence of a non-discrete Hausdorff topology on X with respect to which all functions f\in G are continuous. A topology on X with this property is called a G-topology. The answer is given in terms of the Zariski G-topology \zeta_G on X, that is, the topology generated by the subbase consisting of the sets \{x\in X:f(x)\ne g(x)\} and \{x\in X:f(x)\ne c\}, where f,g\in G and c\in X. We prove that, for a countable monoid G\subset X^X, X admits a non-discrete Hausdorff G-topology if and only if the Zariski G-topology \zeta_G is non-discrete; moreover, in this case, X admits 2^{\mathfrak c} hereditarily normal G-topologies.
