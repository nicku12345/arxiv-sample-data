For a Tychonoff space X, the constructions \hat P(X) and P_\tau(X) of the spaces of probability Radon measures and probability \tau-smooth measures on X are considered. It is proved that these constructions determine functors in the category of Tychonoff spaces, which extend the functor P of probability measures in the category of compacta. In this part we investigate general topological properties of the spaces \hat P(X) and P_\tau(X), as well as categorial properties of the functors \hat P and P_\tau.
