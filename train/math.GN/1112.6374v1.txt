Let X be a Banach space and Conv_H(X) be the space of non-empty closed convex subsets of X, endowed with the Hausdorff metric d_H. We prove that each connected component of the space Conv_H(X) is homeomorphic to one of the spaces: a singleton, the real line, a closed half-plane, the Hilbert cube multiplied by the half-line, the separable Hilbert space, or a Hilbert space of density not less than continuum.
