Let X be a first countable Hausdorff topological group. The limit of a sequence in X defines a function denoted by lim from the set of all convergence sequences to X. This definition was modified by Connor and Grosse-Erdmann for real functions by replacing lim with an arbitrary linear functional G defined on a linear subspace of the vector space of all real sequences. \c{C}akall{\i} extended the concept to topological group setting and introduced the concept of G-sequential compactness and investigated G-sequential continuity and G-sequential compactness in topological groups. In this paper we give a further investigation of G-sequential continuity in topological groups most of which are also new for the real case.
