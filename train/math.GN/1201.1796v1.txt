Recently, Cakalli has introduced a concept of G-sequential connectedness in the sense that a non-empty subset A of a Hausdorff topological group X is G-sequentially connected if there are no non-empty, disjoint G-sequentially closed subsets U and V meeting A such that A\subseteq U\bigcup V. In this paper we investigate further properties of G-sequential connectedness and prove some interesting theorems.
