Let G be an infinite locally compact group and \aleph a cardinal satisfying \aleph_0\le\aleph\le w(G) for the weight w(G) of G. It is shown that there is a closed subgroup N of G with w(N)=\aleph. Sample consequences are:   (1) Every infinite compact group contains an infinite closed metric subgroup.   (2) For a locally compact group G and \aleph a cardinal satisfying \aleph_0\le\aleph\le \lw(G), where \lw(G) is the local weight of G, there are either no infinite compact subgroups at all or there is a compact subgroup N of G with w(N)=\aleph.   (3) For an infinite abelian group G there exists a properly ascending family of locally quasiconvex group topologies on G, say, (\tau_\aleph)_{\aleph_0\le \aleph\le \card(G)}, such that (G,\tau_\aleph)\hat{\phantom{m}}\cong\hat G.   Items (2) and (3) are shown in Section 5.
