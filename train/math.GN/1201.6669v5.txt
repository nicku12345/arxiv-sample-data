We obtain several new characterizations of ultrametric spaces in terms of roundness, generalized roundness, strict p-negative type, and p-polygonal equalities (p > 0). This allows new insight into the isometric embedding of ultrametric spaces into Euclidean spaces. We also consider roundness properties additive metric spaces which are not ultrametric.
