We investigate game-theoretic properties of selection principles related to weaker forms of the Menger and Rothberger properties. For appropriate spaces some of these selection principles are characterized in terms of a corresponding game. We use generic extensions by Cohen reals to illustrate the necessity of some of the hypotheses in our theorems.
