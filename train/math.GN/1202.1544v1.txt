We show, in particular, that a multivalued map f from a closed subspace X of \mathbb R^n to {\rm exp}_k(\mathbb R^n) has a point of period exactly M if and only if its continuous extension \tilde f: \beta X\to {\rm exp}_k(\beta \mathbb R^n) has such a point. The result also holds if one repace \mathbb R^n by a locally compact Lindel\"of space of finite dimension. We also show that if f is a colorable map froma normal space X to the space {\mathcal K}(X) of all compact subsets of X then its extension \tilde f:\beta X\to {\mathcal K}(\beta X) is fixed-point free.
