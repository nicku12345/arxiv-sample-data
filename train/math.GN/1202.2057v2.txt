We define a group RBr(\mathcal{G}) containing, in a sense, the graded complex and orthogonal Brauer groups of a locally compact groupoid \mathcal{G} equipped with an involution. When the involution is trivial, we show that the new group naturally provides a generalization of Donovan-Karoubi's graded orthogonal Brauer group GBrO. More generally, it is shown to be a direct summand of the well-known graded complex Brauer goup. In addition, we prove that RBr(\mathcal{G}) identifies with a direct sum of a Real cohomology group and the abelian group RExt(\mathcal{G},U(1)) of Real graded U(1)-central extensions. A cohomological picture is then given.
