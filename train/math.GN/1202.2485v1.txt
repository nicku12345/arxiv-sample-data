We investigate whether the Hutchinson operator associated with the iterated function system (IFS) is continuous. It clarifies several partial results scattered across recent literature. While the main example for IFS with strict attractor was provided by the family of contractions (the so-called hyperbolic system), the accent was put on ensuring that various contractivity-like conditions are preserved when the Hutchinson operator is induced, unless very recently it was discovered that strict attractors are quite often present for a large class of noncontractive maps, namely projective maps. This sets substantial motivation for the study whether in general continuity of functions guarantees continuity of the induced Hutchinson operator.
