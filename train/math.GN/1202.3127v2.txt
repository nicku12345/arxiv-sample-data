In this note, we shall generalize the notion of a P-space to proximity spaces and investigate the basic properties of these proximities. We therefore define a P_{\aleph_{1}}-proximity to be a proximity where if A_{n}\prec B for all n\in\mathbb{N}, then \bigcup_{n}A_{n}\prec B. It turns out that the class of P_{\aleph_{1}}-proximities is equivalent to the class of \sigma-algebras. Furthermore, the P_{\aleph_{1}}-proximity coreflection of a proximity space is the \sigma-algebra of proximally Baire sets.
