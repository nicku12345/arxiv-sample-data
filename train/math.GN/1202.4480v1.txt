Let \mathcal K be a complete quasivariety of completely regular universal topological algebras of continuous signature \mathcal E (which means that \mathcal K is closed under taking subalgebras, Cartesian products, and includes all completely regular topological \mathcal E-algebras algebraically isomorphic to members of \mathcal K). For a topological space X by F(X) we denote the free universal \mathcal E-algebra over X in the class \mathcal K. Using some extension properties of the Hartman-Mycielski construction we prove that for a closed subspace X of a metrizable (more generally, stratifiable) space Y the induced homomorphism F(X)\to F(Y) between the respective free universal algebras is a closed topological embedding. This generalizes one result of V.Uspenskii concerning embeddings of free topological groups.
