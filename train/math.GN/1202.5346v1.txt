A convex subset X of a linear topological space is called compactly convex if there is a continuous compact-valued map \Phi:X\to exp(X) such that [x,y]\subset\Phi(x)\cup \Phi(y) for all x,y\in X. We prove that each convex subset of the plane is compactly convex. On the other hand, the space R^3 contains a convex set that is not compactly convex. Each compactly convex subset X of a linear topological space L has locally compact closure \bar X which is metrizable if and only if each compact subset of X is metrizable.
