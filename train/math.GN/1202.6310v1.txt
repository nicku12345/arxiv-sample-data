A space X is Eberlein-Grothendieck if X\subset C_p(K) for some compact space K. In this paper we address the problem of whether such a space X is \sigma-discrete whenever it is scattered. We show that if w(K)\leq\omega_1 then X is \sigma-dicrete whenever X has height \omega_1 and it is locally compact or locally countable. It is also proved that every Lindel\"of \v{C}ech-complete scattered space is \sigma-compact.
