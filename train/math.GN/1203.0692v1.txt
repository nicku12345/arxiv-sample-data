In our previous researches, a new digital watermarking scheme based on chaotic iterations has been introduced. This scheme was both stego-secure and topologically secure. The stego-security is to face an attacker in the "watermark only attack" category, whereas the topological security concerns other categories of attacks. Its Lyapunov exponent is evaluated here, to quantify the chaos generated by this scheme.   Keywords : Lyapunov exponent; Information hiding; Security; Chaotic iterations; Digital Watermarking.
