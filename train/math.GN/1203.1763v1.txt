We propose a general approach to defining a contractive-like multivalued mappings F which avoids any use of the Hausdorff distance between the sets F(x) and F(y). Various fixed point theorems are proved under a two-parameter control of the distance function d_{F}(x)=dist(x,F(x)) between a point x \in X and the value F(x) \ss X. Here, both parameters are numerical functions. The first one \a\,:[0,+\i)\rightarrow [1,+\i) controls the distance between x and some appropriate point y \in F(x) in comparison with d_{F}(x), whereas the second one \b\,:[0,+\i)\rightarrow [0,1) estimates d_{F}(y) with respect to d(x,y). It appears that the well harmonized relations between \a and \b are sufficient for the existence of fixed points of F. Our results generalize several known fixed-point theorems.
