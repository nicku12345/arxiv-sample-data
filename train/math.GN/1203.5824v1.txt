The \theta-closed hull of a set A in a topological space is the smallest set C containing A such that, whenever all closed neighborhoods of a point intersect C, this point is in C.   We define a new topological cardinal invariant function, the \theta-bitighness small number of a space X, bts_theta(X), and prove that in every topological space X, the cardinality of the theta-closed hull of each set A is at most |A|^{bts_theta(X)}. Using this result, we synthesize all earlier results on bounds on the cardinality of theta-closed hulls.   We provide applications to P-spaces and to the almost-Lindelof number.
