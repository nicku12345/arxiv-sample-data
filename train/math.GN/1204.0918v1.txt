We establish some general principles and find some counter-examples concerning the Pontryagin reflexivity of precompact groups and P-groups. We prove in particular that: (1) A precompact Abelian group G of bounded order is reflexive iff the dual group \hat{G} has no infinite compact subsets and every compact subset of G is contained in a compact subgroup of G. (2) Any extension of a reflexive P-group by another reflexive P-group is again reflexive. We show on the other hand that an extension of a compact group by a reflexive \omega-bounded group (even dual to a reflexive P-group) can fail to be reflexive. We also show that the P-modification of a reflexive \sigma-compact group can be nonreflexive (even if the P-modification of a locally compact Abelian group is always reflexive).
