We show that for a normal locally-{\mathscr P} space X (where {\mathscr P} is a topological property subject to some mild requirements) the subset C_{\mathscr P}(X) of C_b(X) consisting of those elements whose support has a neighborhood with {\mathscr P}, is a subalgebra of C_b(X) isometrically isomorphic to C_c(Y) for some unique (up to homeomorphism) locally compact Hausdorff space Y. The space Y is explicitly constructed as a subspace of the Stone--\v{C}ech compactification \beta X of X and contains X as a dense subspace. Under certain conditions, C_{\mathscr P}(X) coincides with the set of those elements of C_b(X) whose support has {\mathscr P}, it moreover becomes a Banach algebra, and simultaneously, Y satisfies C_c(Y)=C_0(Y). This includes the cases when {\mathscr P} is the Lindel\"{o}f property and X is either a locally compact paracompact space or a locally-{\mathscr P} metrizable space. In either of the latter cases, if X is non-{\mathscr P}, Y is non-normal, and C_{\mathscr P}(X) fits properly between C_0(X) and C_b(X); even more, we can fit a chain of ideals of certain length between C_0(X) and C_b(X). The known construction of Y enables us to derive a few further properties of either C_{\mathscr P}(X) or Y. Specifically, when {\mathscr P} is the Lindel\"{o}f property and X is a locally-{\mathscr P} metrizable space, we show that \[\dim C_{\mathscr P}(X)=\ell(X)^{\aleph_0},\] where \ell(X) is the Lindel\"{o}f number of X, and when {\mathscr P} is countable compactness and X is a normal space, we show that \[Y=\mathrm{int}_{\beta X}\upsilon X\] where \upsilon X is the Hewitt realcompactification of X.
