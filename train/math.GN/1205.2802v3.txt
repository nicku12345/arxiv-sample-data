We prove a commutative Gelfand--Naimark type theorem, by showing that the set C_s(X) of continuous bounded (real or complex valued) functions with separable support on a locally separable metrizable space X (provided with the supremum norm) is a Banach algebra, isometrically isomorphic to C_0(Y), for some unique (up to homeomorphism) locally compact Hausdorff space Y. The space Y, which we explicitly construct as a subspace of the Stone--\v{C}ech compactification of X, is countably compact, and if X is non-separable, is moreover non-normal; in addition C_0(Y)=C_{00}(Y). When the underlying field of scalars is the complex numbers, the space Y coincides with the spectrum of the {C}^*-algebra C_s(X). Further, we find the dimension of the algebra C_s(X).
