The paper fills gaps in knowledge about Kuratowski operations which are already in the literature. The Cayley table for these operations has been drawn up. Techniques, using only paper and pencil, to point out all semigroups and its isomorphic types are applied. Some results apply only to topology, one can not bring them out, using only properties of the complement and a closure-like operation. The arguments are by systematic study of possibilities.
