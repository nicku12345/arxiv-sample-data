In this work, we will introduce the notion of generalized topological groups using generalized topological structure and generalized continuity defined by ?A. Cs?asz?ar [2]. We will discuss some basic properties of this kind of structures and connectedness properties of this structures are given. Keywords: Generalized topology; generalized continuity; generalized topological groups; generalized connectedness.
