Let {\mathscr P} be a topological property. We say that a space X is {\mathscr P}-connected if there exists no pair C and D of disjoint cozero-sets of X with non-{\mathscr P} closure such that the remainder X\backslash(C\cup D) is contained in a cozero-set of X with {\mathscr P} closure. If {\mathscr P} is taken to be "being empty" then {\mathscr P}-connectedness coincides with connectedness in its usual sense. We characterize completely regular {\mathscr P}-connected spaces, with {\mathscr P} subject to some mild requirements. Then, we study conditions under which unions of {\mathscr P}-connected subspaces of a space are {\mathscr P}-connected. Also, we study classes of mappings which preserve {\mathscr P}-connectedness. We conclude with a detailed study of the special case in which {\mathscr P} is pseudocompactness. In particular, when {\mathscr P} is pseudocompactness, we prove that a completely regular space X is {\mathscr P}-connected if and only if cl_{\beta X}(\beta X\backslash\upsilon X) is connected, and that {\mathscr P}-connectedness is preserved under perfect open continuous surjections. We leave some problems open.
