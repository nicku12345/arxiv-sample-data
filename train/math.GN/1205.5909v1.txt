Motivated by Tukey classification problems and building on work in \cite{Dobrinen/Todorcevic11}, we develop a new hierarchy of topological Ramsey spaces \mathcal{R}_{\alpha}, \alpha<\omega_1. These spaces form a natural hierarchy of complexity, \mathcal{R}_0 being the Ellentuck space, and for each \alpha<\omega_1, \mathcal{R}_{\alpha+1} coming immediately after \mathcal{R}_{\alpha} in complexity. Associated with each \mathcal{R}_{\alpha} is an ultrafilter \mathcal{U}_{\alpha}, which is Ramsey for \mathcal{R}_{\alpha}, and in particular, is a rapid p-point satisfying certain partition properties. We prove Ramsey-classification theorems for equivalence relations on fronts on \mathcal{R}_{\alpha}, 2\le\alpha<\omega_1. These are analogous to the Pudlak-\Rodl\ Theorem canonizing equivalence relations on barriers on the Ellentuck space. We then apply our Ramsey-classification theorems to completely classify all Rudin-Keisler equivalence classes of ultrafilters which are Tukey reducible to \mathcal{U}_{\alpha}, for each 2\le\alpha<\omega_1: Every ultrafilter which is Tukey reducible to \mathcal{U}_{\alpha} is isomorphic to a countable iteration of Fubini products of ultrafilters from among a fixed countable collection of rapid p-points. Moreover, we show that the Tukey types of nonprincipal ultrafilters Tukey reducible to \mathcal{U}_{\alpha} form a descending chain of order type \alpha+1.
