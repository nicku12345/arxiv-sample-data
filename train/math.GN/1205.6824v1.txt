We settle all problems posed by Scheepers, in his tribute paper to Gerlits, concerning the additivity of the Gerlits--Nagy property and related additivity numbers. We apply these results to compute the minimal number of concentrated sets of reals (in the sense of Besicovitch) whose union, when multiplied with a Gerlits--Nagy space, need not have Rothberger's property. We apply these methods to construct a large family of spaces, whose product with every Hurewicz space has Menger's property.
