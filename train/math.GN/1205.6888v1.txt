Given a compact Lie group G, a reconstruction theorem for free G-manifolds is proved. As a by-product reconstruction results for locally trivial bundles are presented. Next, the main theorem is generalized to G-manifolds with one orbit type. These are the first reconstruction results in the category of G-spaces, showing also that the reconstruction in this category is very specific and involved.
