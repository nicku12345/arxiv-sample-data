A space Y is called an {\em extension} of a space X if Y contains X as a dense subspace. Two extensions of X are said to be {\em equivalent} if there is a homeomorphism between them which fixes X point-wise. For two (equivalence classes of) extensions Y and Y' of X let Y\leq Y' if there is a continuous function of Y' into Y which fixes X point-wise. An extension Y of X is called a {\em one-point extension} if Y\backslash X is a singleton. An extension Y of X is called {\em first-countable} if Y is first-countable at points of Y\backslash X. Let {\mathcal P} be a topological property. An extension Y of X is called a {\em {\mathcal P}-extension} if it has {\mathcal P}.   In this article, for a given locally compact paracompact space X, we consider the two classes of one-point \v{C}ech-complete {\mathcal P}-extensions of X and one-point first-countable locally-{\mathcal P} extensions of X, and we study their order-structures, by relating them to the topology of a certain subspace of the outgrowth \beta X\backslash X. Here {\mathcal P} is subject to some requirements and include \sigma-compactness and the Lindel\"{o}f property as special cases.
