Let T:= T(A, {\mathcal D}) be a disk-like self-affine tile generated by an integral expanding matrix A and a consecutive collinear digit set {\mathcal D}, and let f(x)=x^{2}+px+q be the characteristic polynomial of A. In the paper, we identify the boundary \partial T with a sofic system by constructing a neighbor graph and derive equivalent conditions for the pair (A,{\mathcal D}) to be a number system. Moreover, by using the graph-directed construction and a device of pseudo-norm \omega, we find the generalized Hausdorff dimension \dim_H^{\omega} (\partial T)=2\log \rho(M)/\log |q| where \rho(M) is the spectral radius of certain contact matrix M. Especially, when A is a similarity, we obtain the standard Hausdorff dimension \dim_H (\partial T)=2\log \rho/\log |q| where \rho is the largest positive zero of the cubic polynomial x^{3}-(|p|-1)x^{2}-(|q|-|p|)x-|q|, which is simpler than the known result.
