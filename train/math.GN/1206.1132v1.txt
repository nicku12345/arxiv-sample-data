We introduce and investigate the class of skeletally Dugundji spaces as a skeletal analogue of Dugundji space. The main result states that the following conditions are equivalent for a given space X: (i) X is skeletally Dugundji; (ii) Every compactification of X is co-absolute to a Dugundji space; (iii) Every C^*-embedding of the absolute p(X) in another space is strongly \pi-regular; (iv) X has a multiplicative lattice in the sense of Shchepin \cite{s76} consisting of skeletal maps.
