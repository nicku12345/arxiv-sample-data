This paper is a follow-up to the author's work "Topology of probability measure space, I" devoted to investigation of the functors \hat P and P_\tau of spaces of probability \tau-smooth and Radon measures. In this part, we study the barycenter map for spaces of Radon probability measures. The obtained results are applied to show that the functor \hat P is monadic in the category of metrizable spaces. Also we show that the functors \hat P and P_\tau admit liftings to the category BMetr of bounded metric spaces and also to the category Unif of uniform spaces, and investigate properties of those liftings.
