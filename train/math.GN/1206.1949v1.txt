The notion of max-plus convex subset of Euclidean space can be naturally extended to other linear spaces. The aim of this paper is to describe the topology of hyperspaces of max-plus convex subsets of Tychonov powers \mathbb R^\tau of the real line. We show that the corresponding spaces are AR's if and only if \tau\le\omega_1.
