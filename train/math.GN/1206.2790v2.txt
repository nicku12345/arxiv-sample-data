Given a distribution \rho on persistence diagrams and observations X_1,...X_n \stackrel{iid}{\sim} \rho we introduce an algorithm in this paper that estimates a Fr\'echet mean from the set of diagrams X_1,...X_n. If the underlying measure \rho is a combination of Dirac masses \rho = \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^m \delta_{Z_i} then we prove the algorithm converges to a local minimum and a law of large numbers result for a Fr\'echet mean computed by the algorithm given observations drawn iid from \rho. We illustrate the convergence of an empirical mean computed by the algorithm to a population mean by simulations from Gaussian random fields.
