To formulate our results let f be a continuous map from \mathbb R^n to 2^{\mathbb R^n} and k a natural number such that |f(x)|\leq k for all x. We prove that f is fixed-point free if and only if its continuous extension \tilde f:\beta \mathbb R^n\to 2^{\beta \mathbb R^n} is fixed-point free. If one wishes to stay within metric terms, the result can be formulated as follows: f is fixed-point free if and only if there exists a continuous fixed-point free extension \bar f: b\mathbb R^n\to 2^{b\mathbb R^n} for some metric compactificaton b\mathbb R^n of \mathbb R^n. Using the classical notion of colorablity, we prove that such an f is always colorable. Moreover, a number of colors sufficient to paint the graph can be expressed as a function of n and k only. The mentioned results also hold if the domain is replaced by any closed subspace of \mathbb R^n without any changes in the range.
