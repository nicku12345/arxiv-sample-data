For a non-compact metrizable space X, let {\mathcal E}(X) be the set of all one-point metrizable extensions of X, and when X is locally compact, let {\mathcal E}_K(X) denote the set of all locally compact elements of {\mathcal E}(X) and \lambda: {\mathcal E}(X)\rightarrow{\mathcal Z}(\beta X\backslash X) be the order-anti-isomorphism (onto its image) defined in: [HJW] M. Henriksen, L. Janos and R.G. Woods, Properties of one-point completions of a non-compact metrizable space, Comment. Math. Univ. Carolinae 46 (2005), 105-123. By definition \lambda(Y)= \bigcap_{n<\omega}cl_{\beta X}(U_n\cap X)\backslash X, where Y=X\cup\{p\}\in{\mathcal E}(X) and \{U_n\}_{n<\omega} is an open base at p in Y. Answering the question of [HJW], we characterize the elements of the image of \lambda as exactly those non-empty zero-sets of \beta X which miss X, and the elements of the image of {\mathcal E}_K(X) under \lambda , as those which are moreover clopen in \beta X\backslash X. We then study the relation between {\mathcal E}(X) and {\mathcal E}_K(X) and their order structures, and introduce a subset {\mathcal E}_S(X) of {\mathcal E}(X). We conclude with some theorems on the cardinality of the sets {\mathcal E}(X) and {\mathcal E}_K(X), and some open questions.
