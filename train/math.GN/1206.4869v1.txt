A table of the families of alternating knots formed by conways is presented. The Conway's function is shown with the use of linear algebra in terms of natural numbers, called conways, that represent the number of crossings along a direction, as it was used by J. Conway for the classification of knots. Colored figures and tangles show the parts of the knots or tangles with a definite handedness: all the colored parts of the knot family are associated to a particular orientation. For example all the colored conways have a right hand screw thread, and all the white conways have the opposite handedness. Figures for six conways were colored with two different colors for forty two families in order to show the dissection of the knot in two tangles corresponding to a particular factorization of the Conway's function. The Conway's function of each family is expressed as the internal product of two vectors corresponding to each of two colored family 2-tangles, and with a full factorization which is not unique.
