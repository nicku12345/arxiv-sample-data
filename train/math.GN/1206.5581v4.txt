It is proved that no non-meager subspace of the space [\omega]^\omega equipped with the Ellentuck topology does admit a Kuratowski partition, that is such a subset cannot be covered by a family \mathfrak{F} of disjoint relatively meager sets such that \bigcup\mathfrak{F}' has the Baire property (relatively) for every subfamily \mathfrak{F}'\subseteq\mathfrak{F}. It is also shown that the existence of Kuratowski partitions is not a metric problem. Some remarks concerning continuous restrictions of functions with domain in the Ellentuck space are made.
