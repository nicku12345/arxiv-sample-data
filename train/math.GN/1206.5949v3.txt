Let \FP(X) be the free paratopological group on a topological space X. For n\in \N, denote by \FP_n(X) the subset of \FP(X) consisting of all words of reduced length at most n, and by i_n the natural mapping from (X\oplus X^{-1}\oplus \{e\})^n to \FP_n(X). In this paper a neighbourhood base at the identity e in \FP_2(X) is found. A number of characterisations are then given of the circumstances under which i_2\colon (X\oplus X^{-1}_d\oplus \{e\})^2\to \FP_2(X) is a quotient map, where X is a T_1 space and X^{-1}_d denotes the set X^{-1} equipped with the discrete topology. Further characterisations are given in the case where X is a transitive T_1 space. Several specific spaces and classes of spaces are also examined. For example, i_2 is a quotient for every countable subspace of \R, i_2 is not a quotient for any uncountable compact subspace of \R, and it is undecidable in ZFC whether an uncountable subspace of \R exists for which i_2 is a quotient.
