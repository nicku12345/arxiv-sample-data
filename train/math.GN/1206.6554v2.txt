The research in this paper is a continuation of the investigation of the cardinality of the \theta-closed hull of subsets of spaces. This research obtains new upper bounds of the cardinality of the \theta-closed hull of subsets using cardinal functions of \theta-bitightness (\cite{Ca-Ko}), finite \theta-bitightness (\cite{Ca-Ca-Pa-Ts}) and \theta-bitightness small number (\cite{Ca-Ca-Pa-Ts}) of spaces. In the final section, examples of spaces are presented including one that answers a question posed in \cite{Bo-Ca-Ma} and \cite{Bo-Pa}.
