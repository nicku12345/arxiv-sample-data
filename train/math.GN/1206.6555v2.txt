In this article, starting with results from a paper by Cammaroto and Ko\v{c}inac in 1993, we prove that t_{\theta}(X) = t_{\theta}(X_{s}) = t(X_{s}) = F_{\theta}(X) = F_{\theta}(X_{s}) = F(X_{s}) for every H-closed and Urysohn space and we present some useful examples to study the full relationships among the cardinal functions t, t_{\theta}, F and F_{\theta} in the context of H-closed and Urysohn spaces. Also, we construct an H-closed space H for which F_{\theta}(H) < t_{\theta}(H). Two questions posed by Cammaroto and Ko\v{c}inac about H-closed spaces are answered.
