This article extends the recent study of the cardinal functions F_{\theta} and t_{\theta} for H-closed Urysohn spaces and the research of I. Bandlov and V.I. Ponomarev on tightness type of absolutes. In particular, basic results are obtained and used to study the relationships among the cardinal functions t, t_{\theta}, F and F_{\theta} in the context of Iliadis and Banaschewski absolutes of Hausdorff spaces.
