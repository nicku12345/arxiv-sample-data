A uniform space is said to be non-Archimedean if it is generated by equivalence relations. If \lambda is a cardinal, then a non-Archimedean uniform space (X,\mathcal{U}) is \lambda-totally bounded if each equivalence relation in \mathcal{U} partitions X into less than \lambda blocks. If A is an infinite set, then let \Omega(A) be the algebra with universe A and where each a\in A is a fundamental constant and every finitary function is a fundamental operation. We shall give a duality between complete non-Archimedean |A|^{+}-totally bounded uniform spaces and subdirect powers of \Omega(A). We shall apply this duality to characterize the algebras dual to supercomplete non-Archimedean uniform spaces.
