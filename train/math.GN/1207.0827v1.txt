Given a topological space X, we study the structure of \infty-convex subsets in the space SC_p(X) of scatteredly continuous functions on X. Our main result says that for a topological space X with countable strong fan tightness, each potentially bounded \infty-convex subset F\subset SC_p(X) is weakly discontinuous in the sense that each non-empty subset A\subset X contains an open dense subset U\subset A such that each function f|U, f\in F, is continuous. This implies that F has network weight nw(F)\le nw(X).
