We continue the study of topologies of strong uniform convergence on bornologies initiated in [G. Beer and S. Levi, Strong uniform continuity, J. Math Anal. Appl., 350:568-589, 2009] and [G. Beer and S. Levi, Uniform continuity, uniform convergence and shields, Set-Valued and Variational Analysis, 18:251-275, 2010]. We study cardinal invariants of topologies of (strong) uniform convergence on bornologies on the space of continuous real-valued functions and we also generalize some known results from the literature.
