We prove a complete analog of the Borsuk Homotopy Extension Theorem for arbitrary semiprojective C*-algebras. We also obtain some other results about semiprojective C*-algebras: a partial lifting theorem with specified quotient, a lifting result for homomorphisms close to a liftable homomorphism, and that sufficiently close homomorphisms from a semiprojective C*-algebra are homotopic.
