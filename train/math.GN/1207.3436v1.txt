Recall that a Hausdorff space X is said to be Namioka if for every compact (Hausdorff) space Y and every metric space Z, every separately continuous function f:X\times{Y}\rightarrow{Z} is continuous on D\times{Y} for some dense G_\delta subset D of X. It is well known that in the class of all metrizable spaces, Namioka and Baire spaces coincide (Saint-Raymond, 1983). Further it is known that every completely regular Namioka space is Baire and that every separable Baire space is Namioka (Saint-Raymond, 1983).   In our paper we study spaces X, we call them weakly Namioka, for which the conclusion of the theorem for Namioka spaces holds provided that the assumption of compactness of Y is replaced by second countability of Y. We will prove that in the class of all completely regular separable spaces and in the class of all perfectly normal spaces, X is Baire if and only if it is weakly Namioka.
