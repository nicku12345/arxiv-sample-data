The class of Hausdorff spaces that are continuous images of compact orderable spaces is studied by analyzing the relationship between the elements of this class and compact orderable spaces in a back-and-forth fashion. Structure results for this class are then obtained, as well as continuum-theoretic embedding results. Applications to Boolean algebras are also demonstrated, specifically concerning the relationship between interval algebras and pseudo-tree algebras.
