In this paper we introduce and study a new topologo-algebraic structure called a (di)topological unosemigroup. This is a topological semigroup endowed with continuous unary operations of left and right units (which have certain continuous division property called the dicontinuity). We show that the class of ditopological unosemigroups contains all topological groups, all topological semilattices, all uniformizable topological unoid-semigroups, all compact topological unosemigroups, and is closed under the operations of taking subunosemigroup, Tychonoff product, reduced product, semidirect product, and the Hartman-Mycielski extension.
