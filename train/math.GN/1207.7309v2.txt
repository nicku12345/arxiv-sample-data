We present some results supporting the Iwase-Sakai conjecture about coincidence of the topological complexity TC(X) and monoidal topological complexity TC^M(X). Using these results we provide lower and upper bounds for the topological complexity of the wedge X\vee Y. We use these bounds to give a counterexample to the conjecture asserting that TC(X')\le TC(X) for any covering map p:X'\to X.   We discuss a possible reduction of the monoidal topological complexity to the LS-category. Also we apply the LS-category to give a short proof of the Arnold-Kuiper theorem.
