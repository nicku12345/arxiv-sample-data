The aim of this note is to investigate the open-open game of uncountable length. We introduce a cardinal number \mu(X), which says how long the Player I has to play to ensure a victory. It is proved that \su(X)\leq\mu(X)\leq\su(X)^+. We also introduce the class \mathcal C_\kappa of topological spaces that can be represented as the inverse limit of \kappa-complete system \{X_\sigma,\pi^\sigma_\rho,\Sigma\} with \w(X_\sigma)\leq\kappa and skeletal bonding maps. It is shown that product of spaces which belong to \mathcal C_\kappa also belongs to this class and \mu(X)\leq\kappa whenever X\in\mathcal C_\kappa .
