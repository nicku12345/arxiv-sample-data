A function f:X\to Y between topological spaces is called {\em compact-preserving} if the image f(K) of each compact subset K\subset X is compact. We prove that a function f:X\to Y defined on a strong Frechet space X is compact-preserving if and only if for each point x\in X there is a compact subset K_x\subset Y such that for each neighborhood O_{f(x)}\subset Y of f(x) there is a neighborhood O_x\subset X of x such that f(O_x)\subset O_{f(x)}\cup K_x and the set K_x\setminus O_{f(x)} is finite. This characterization is applied to give an alternative proof of a classical characterization of continuous functions on locally connected metrizable spaces as functions that preserve compact and connected sets. Also we show that for each compact-preserving function f:X\to Y defined on a (strong) Fr\'echet space X, the restriction f|LI'_f (resp. f|LI_f) is continuous. Here LI_f is the set of points x\in X of local infinity of f and LI'_f is the set of non-isolated points of the set LI_f. Suitable examples show that the obtained results cannot be improved.
