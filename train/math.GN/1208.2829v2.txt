We characterize, in terms of X, extensional dimension of the Stone-\v{C}ech corona \beta X \setminus X of locally compact and Lindel\"{o}f space X. The non-Lindel\"{o}f case case is also settled in terms of extending proper maps with values in I^{\tau}\setminus L, where L is a finite complex. Further, for a finite complex L, an uncountable cardinal \tau and a Z_{\tau}-set X in the Tychonov cube I^{\tau} we find necessary and sufficient condition, in terms of I^{\tau}\setminus X, for X to be in the class \operatorname{AE}([L]). We also introduce a concept of a proper absolute extensor and characterize the product [0,1)\times I^{\tau} as the only locally compact and Lindel\"{o}f proper absolute extensor of weight \tau > \omega which has the same pseudocharacter at each point.
