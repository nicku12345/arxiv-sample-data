We prove the following result announced in Todorov and Valov: Any homogeneous, metric ANR-continuum is a V^n_G-continuum provided \dim_GX=n\geq 1 and \check{H}^n(X;G)\neq 0, where G is a principal ideal domain. This implies that any homogeneous n-dimensional metric ANR-continuum with \check{H}^n(X;G)\neq 0 is a V^n-continuum in the sense of Alexandroff (1957). We also prove that any finite-dimensional homogeneous metric continuum X, satisfying \check{H}^n(X;G)\neq 0 for some group G and n\geq 1, cannot be separated by a compactum K with \check{H}^{n-1}(K;G)=0 and \dim_G K\leq n-1. This provides a partial answer to a question of Kallipoliti-Papasoglu (2007) whether any two-dimensional homogeneous Peano continuum cannot be separated by arcs.
