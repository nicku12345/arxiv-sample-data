We study the semigroup \mathscr{I}^{\nearrow}_{\infty}(\mathbb{Z}) of monotone injective partial selfmaps of the set of integers having cofinite domain and image. We show that \mathscr{I}^{\nearrow}_{\infty}(\mathbb{Z}) is bisimple and all of its non-trivial semigroup homomorphisms are either isomorphisms or group homomorphisms. We also prove that every Baire topology \tau on \mathscr{I}^{\nearrow}_{\infty}(\mathbb{Z}) such that (\mathscr{I}^{\nearrow}_{\infty}(\mathbb{Z}),\tau) is a Hausdorff semitopological semigroup is discrete and we construct a non-discrete Hausdorff inverse semigroup topology \tau_W on \mathscr{I}^{\nearrow}_{\infty}(\mathbb{Z}). We show that the discrete semigroup \mathscr{I}^{\nearrow}_{\infty}(\mathbb{Z}) cannot be embedded into some classes of compact-like topological semigroups and that its remainder under the closure in a topological semigroup S is an ideal in S.
