The theory of covering spaces is often used to prove the Nielsen-Schreier theorem, which states that every subgroup of a free group is free. We apply the more general theory of semicovering spaces to obtain analogous subgroup theorems for topological groups: Every open subgroup of a free Graev topological group is a free Graev topological group. An open subgroup of a free Markov topological group is a free Markov topological group if and only if it is disconnected.
