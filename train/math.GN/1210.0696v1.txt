Let G be a group, \mathcal{P}_G be the family of all subsets of G. For a subset A\subseteq G, we put \Delta(A)=\{g\in G:|gA\cap A|=\infty\}. The mapping \Delta:\mathcal{P}_G\rightarrow\mathcal{P}_G, A\mapsto\Delta(A), is called a combinatorial derivation and can be considered as an analogue of the topological derivation d:\mathcal{P}_X\rightarrow\mathcal{P}_X, A\mapsto A^d, where X is a topological space and A^d is the set of all limit points of A. Content: elementary properties, thin and almost thin subsets, partitions, inverse construction and \Delta-trajectories, \Delta and d.
