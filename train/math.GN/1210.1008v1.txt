A 1910 theorem of Brouwer characterizes the Cantor set as the unique totally disconnected, compact metric space without isolated points. A 1920 theorem of Sierpinski characterizes the rationals as the unique countable metric space without isolated points. The purpose of this exposition is to give an accessible overview of this celebrated pair of uniqueness results. It is illuminating to treat the problems simultaneously because of commonalities in their proofs. Some of the more counterintuitive implications of these results are explored through examples. Additionally, near-examples are provided which thwart various attempts to relax hypotheses.
