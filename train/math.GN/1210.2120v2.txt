If \mathcal P is a family of filters over some set I, a topological space X is \emph{sequencewise \mathcal P-\brfrt compact} if, for every I-indexed sequence of elements of X, there is F \in \mathcal P such that the sequence has an F-limit point. Countable compactness, sequential compactness, initial \kappa-compactness, [ \lambda ,\mu]-compactness, the Menger and Rothberger properties can all be expressed in terms of sequencewise \mathcal P-compactness, for appropriate choices of \mathcal P. We show that sequencewise \mathcal P-compactness is preserved under taking products if and only if there is a filter F \in \mathcal P such that sequencewise \mathcal P-compactness is equivalent to F-compactness. If this is the case, and there exists a sequencewise \mathcal P-compact T_1 topological space with more than one point, then F is necessarily an ultrafilter. The particular cases of sequential compactness and of [ \lambda ,\mu]-compactness are analyzed in detail.
