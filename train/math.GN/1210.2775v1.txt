We call a value y=f(x) of a map f:X\to Y dimensionally regular if \dim X\le \dim(Y\times f^{-1}(y)). It was shown in \cite{first-exotic} that if a map f:X\to Y between compact metric spaces does not have dimensionally regular values, then X is a Boltyanskii compactum, i.e. a compactum satisfying the equality \dim(X\times X)=2\dim X-1. In this paper we prove that every Boltyanskii compactum X of dimension \dim X \geq 6 admits a map f:X\to Y without dimensionally regular values. Also we exhibit a 4-dimensional Boltyanskii compactum for which every map has a dimensionally regular value.
