Let \mathcal{Z(R)} be the set of zero divisor elements of a commutative ring R with identity and \mathcal{M} be the space of minimal prime ideals of R with Zariski topology. An ideal I of R is called strongly dense ideal or briefly sd-ideal if I\subseteq \mathcal{Z(R)} and is contained in no minimal prime ideal. We denote by R_{K}(\mathcal{M}), the set of all a\in R for which \bar{D(a)}=\bar{\mathcal{M}\setminus V(a)} is compact. We show that R has property (A) and \mathcal{M} is compact \ifif R has no sd-ideal. It is proved that R_{K}(\mathcal{M}) is an essential ideal (resp., sd-ideal) \ifif \mathcal{M} is an almost locally compact (resp., \mathcal{M} is a locally compact non-compact) space. The intersection of essential minimal prime ideals of a reduced ring R need not be an essential ideal. We find an equivalent condition for which any (resp., any countable) intersection of essential minimal prime ideals of a reduced ring R is an essential ideal. Also it is proved that the intersection of essential minimal prime ideals of C(X) is equal to the socle of C(X) (i.e., C_{F}(X)=O^{\beta X\setminus I(X)}). Finally, we show that a topological space X is pseudo-discrete \ifif I(X)=X_{L} and C_{K}(X) is a pure ideal.
