We prove that for every number k each countable infinite group G admits a partition G=A\cup B into two sets which are k-meager in the sense that for every k-element subset K\subset G the sets KA and KB are not thick. The proof is based on the fact that G possesses a syndetic submeasure, i.e., a left-invariant submeasure \mu:\mathcal P(G)\to[0,1] such that for each \epsilon > 1/|G| and subset A\subset G with \mu(A)<1 there is a set B\subset G\setminus A such that \mu(B)<\epsilon and FB=G for some finite subset F\subset G.
