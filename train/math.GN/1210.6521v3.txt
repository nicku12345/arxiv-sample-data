Let \cal{P} be an open filter base for a filter \cal{F} on X. We denote by C^{\cal{P}}(X) (C_{\infty\cal{P}}(X)) the set of all functions f\in C(X) where Z(f) (\{x: |f(x)|< \frac{1}{n}\}) contains an element of \cal{P}. First, we observe that every proper subrings in the sense of Acharyya and Ghosh (Topology Proc. 2010) has such form and vice versa. After wards, we generalize some well known theorems about C_{K}(X), C_{\psi}(X) and C_{\infty}(X) for C^{\cal{P}}(X) and C_{\infty\cal{P}}(X). We observe that C_{\infty\cal{P}}(X) may not be an ideal of C(X). It is shown that C_{\infty\cal{P}}(X) is an ideal of C(X) and for each F\in\cal{F}, X\setminus \overline{F} is bounded \ifif the set of non-cluster points of the filter \cal{F} is bounded. By this result, we investigate topological spaces for which C_{\infty\cal{P}}(X) is an ideal of C(X) whenever \cal{P}=\{A\subsetneq X: A is open and X\setminus A is bounded \} (resp., \cal{P}=\{A\subsetneq X: X\setminus A is finite \}). Moreover, we prove that C^{\cal{P}}(X) is an essential (resp., free) ideal \ifif the set \{V: V is open and X\setminus V\in\mathcal{F}\} is a \pi-base for X (resp., \mathcal{F} has no cluster point). Finally, the filter \cal{F} for which C_{\infty\cal{P}}(X) is a regular ring (resp., z-ideal) is characterized.
