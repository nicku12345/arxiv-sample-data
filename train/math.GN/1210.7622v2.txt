Given an infinite group G and a subset A of G we let \Delta(A) = {g \in G : |gA \cap A| =\infty} (this is sometimes called the combinatorial derivation of A). A subset A of G is called large if there exists a finite subset F of G such that FA=G. We show that given a large set X, and a decomposition X=A_1 \cup ... \cup A_n, there must exist an i such that \Delta(A_i) is large. This answers a question of Protasov. We also answer a number of related questions of Protasov.
