A group G is called hereditarily non-topologizable if, for every H\le G, no quotient of H admits a non-discrete Hausdorff topology. We construct first examples of infinite hereditarily non-topologizable groups. This allows us to prove that c-compactness does not imply compactness for topological groups. We also answer several other open questions about c-compact groups asked by Dikranjan and Uspenskij. On the other hand, we suggest a method of constructing topologizable groups based on generic properties in the space of marked k-generated groups. As an application, we show that there exist non-discrete quasi-cyclic groups of finite exponent; this answers a question of Morris and Obraztsov.
