A space Y is called an extension of a space X if Y contains X as a dense subspace. An extension Y of X is called a one-point extension of X if Y\backslash X is a singleton. P. Alexandroff proved that any locally compact non-compact Hausdorff space X has a one-point compact Hausdorff extension, called the one-point compactification of X. Motivated by this, S. Mr\'{o}wka and J.H. Tsai [On local topological properties. II, Bull. Acad. Polon. Sci. S\'{e}r. Sci. Math. Astronom. Phys. 19 (1971), 1035-1040] posed the following more general question: For what pairs of topological properties {\mathscr P} and {\mathscr Q} does a locally-{\mathscr P} space X having {\mathscr Q} possess a one-point extension having both {\mathscr P} and {\mathscr Q}? Here, we provide an answer to this old question.
