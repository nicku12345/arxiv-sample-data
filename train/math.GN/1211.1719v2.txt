In this article we investigate which compact spaces remain compact under countably closed forcing. We prove that, assuming the Continuum Hypothesis, the natural generalizations to \omega_1-sequences of the selection principle and topological game versions of the Rothberger property are not equivalent, even for compact spaces. We also show that Tall and Usuba's "\aleph_1-Borel Conjecture" is equiconsistent with the existence of an inaccessible cardinal.
