We introduce the notion of admissible functions and show that the family of L-functions introduced by Lim in [Nonlinear Anal. 46(2001), 113--120] and the family of test functions introduced by Geraghty in [Proc. Amer. Math. Soc., 40(1973), 604--608] are admissible. Then we prove that if \phi is an admissible function, (X,d) is a complete metric space, and T is a mapping on X such that, for \alpha(s)=\phi(s)/s, the condition 1/(1+\alpha(d(x,Tx))) d(x,Tx) < d(x,y) implies d(Tx,Ty) < \phi(d(x,y)), for all x,y\in X, then T has a unique fixed point. We also show that our fixed point theorem characterizes the metric completeness of X.
