The quasi-Lindel\"of property was first introduced by Arhangelski in \cite{Arc}, as a strengthening of the weakly Lindel\"of property. However, unlike Lindel\"of and weakly Lindel\"of spaces, very little is known about how quasi-Lindel\"of spaces behave under the main topological operations, and how the property relates to separation axioms. In the present paper, we look at several properties of quasi-Lindel\"of spaces. We consider several examples: a weakly Lindel\"of space which is not quasi-Lindel\"of, a product of Lindel\"of spaces which is not even quasi-Lindel\"of, and a quasi-Lindel\"of space which is not ccc. At the end, we pose some open questions.
