We prove additive and multiplicative partition theorems, obtaining combinatorial results for p-quasicyclic groups, where p is a prime number. We also get density results for p-quasicyclic groups via left F{\o}lner sequences of non-empty finite subsets of it, giving a sufficient condition in order a subset of a p-quasicyclic group to contain arbitrary long arithmetic progressions. Finally, we introduce the notion of a dynamical system over p-quasicyclic groups extending the classical notion of a topological dynamical system and we prove (multiple) recurrent results for the p-quasicyclic groups. In particular, we prove recurrent results analogous to Furstenberg-Weiss type theorems for classical systems.
