For a given measure space (X,{\mathscr B},\mu) we construct all measure spaces (Y,{\mathscr C},\lambda) in which (X,{\mathscr B},\mu) is embeddable. The construction is modeled on the ultrafilter construction of the Stone--\v{C}ech compactification of a completely regular topological space. Under certain conditions the construction simplifies. Examples are given when this simplification occurs.
