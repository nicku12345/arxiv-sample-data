Noetherian type and Noetherian \pi-type are two cardinal functions which were introduced by Peregudov in 1997, capturing some properties studied earlier by the Russian School. Their behavior has been shown to be akin to that of the \emph{cellularity}, that is the supremum of the sizes of pairwise disjoint non-empty open sets in a topological space. Building on that analogy, we study the Noetherian \pi-type of \kappa-Suslin Lines, and we are able to determine it for every \kappa up to the first singular cardinal. We then prove a consequence of Chang's Conjecture for \aleph_\omega regarding the Noetherian type of countably supported box products which generalizes a result of Lajos Soukup. We finish with a connection between PCF theory and the Noetherian type of certain Pixley-Roy hyperspaces.
