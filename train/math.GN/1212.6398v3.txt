Two classical results characterizing regularity of a convergence space in terms of continuous extensions of maps on one hand, and in terms of continuity of limits for the continuous convergence on the other, are extended to convergence-approach spaces. Characterizations are obtained for two alternative extensions of regularity to convergence-approach spaces: regularity and strong regularity. The results improve upon what is known even in the convergence case. On the way, a new notion of strictness for convergence-approach spaces is introduced.
