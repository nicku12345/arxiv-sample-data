In the paper we describe the structure of \mathscr{AH}-completions and \mathscr{H}-completions of the discrete semilattices (\mathbb{N},\min) and (\mathbb{N},\max). We give an example of an \mathscr{H}-complete topological semilattice which is not \mathscr{AH}-complete. Also we construct an \mathscr{H}-complete topological semilattice of cardinality \lambda which has 2^\lambda many open-and-closed continuous homomorphic images which are not \mathscr{H}-complete topological semilattices. The constructed examples give a negative answer to Question 17 from the paper J. W. Stepp, {\it Algebraic maximal semilattices}. Pacific J. Math. {\bf 58}:1 (1975), 243-248.
