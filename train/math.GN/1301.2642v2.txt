V. G. Pestov described a neighborhood base at the identity of the Markov free topological group F(X) on a Tychonoff space X in terms of the fine uniformity on X. In this paper, an analogue of Pestov's description for the Markov free paratopological group \FP(X) on a space X in terms of the fine quasi-uniformity on X is found and some properties of the Markov and Graev free paratopological groups are presented.
