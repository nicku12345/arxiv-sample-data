The notion of the decomposition complexity was introduced in \cite{GTY} using a game theoretical approach. We introduce a notion of straight decomposition complexity and compare it with the original as well with the asymptotic property C. Then we define a game theoretical analog of Haver's property C in the classical dimension theory and compare it with the original.
