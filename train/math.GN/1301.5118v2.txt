In this paper we study some additive properties of subsets of the set \nats of positive integers: A subset A of \nats is called {\it k-summable} (where k\in\ben) if A contains \textstyle \big{\sum_{n\in F}x_n | \emp\neq F\subseteq {1,2,...,k\} \big} for some k-term sequence of natural numbers x_1<x_2 < ... < x_k. We say A \subseteq \nats is finite FS-big if A is k-summable for each positive integer k. We say is A \subseteq \nats is infinite FS-big if for each positive integer k, A contains {\sum_{n\in F}x_n | \emp\neq F\subseteq \nats and #F\leq k} for some infinite sequence of natural numbers x_1<x_2 < ... . We say A\subseteq \nats  is an IP-set if A contains {\sum_{n\in F}x_n | \emp\neq F\subseteq \nats and #F<\infty} for some infinite sequence of natural numbers x_1<x_2 < ... . By the Finite Sums Theorem [5], the collection of all IP-sets is partition regular, i.e., if A is an IP-set then for any finite partition of A, one cell of the partition is an IP-set. Here we prove that the collection of all finite FS-big sets is also partition regular. Let \TM =011010011001011010...  denote the Thue-Morse word fixed by the morphism 0\mapsto 01 and 1\mapsto 10. For each factor u of \TM we consider the set \TM\big|_u\subseteq \nats of all occurrences of u in \TM. In this note we characterize the sets \TM\big|_u in terms of the additive properties defined above. Using the Thue-Morse word we show that the collection of all infinite FS-big sets is not partition regular.
