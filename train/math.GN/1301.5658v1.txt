We compare the forcing related properties of a complete Boolean algebra B with the properties of the convergences \lambda_s (the algebraic convergence) and \lambda_{ls} on B generalizing the convergence on the Cantor and Aleksandrov cube respectively. In particular we show that \lambda_{ls} is a topological convergence iff forcing by B does not produce new reals and that \lambda_{ls} is weakly topological if B satisfies condition (\hbar) (implied by the {\mathfrak t}-cc). On the other hand, if \lambda_{ls} is a weakly topological convergence, then B is a 2^{\mathfrak h}-cc algebra or in some generic extension the distributivity number of the ground model is greater than or equal to the tower number of the extension. So, the statement "The convergence \lambda_{ls} on the collapsing algebra B=\ro ((\omega_2)^{<\omega}) is weakly topological" is independent of ZFC.
