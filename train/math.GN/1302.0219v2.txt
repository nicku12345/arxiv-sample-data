By a characterization of semiprime SA-rings by Birkenmeier, Ghirati and Taherifar in \cite[Theorem 4.4]{B}, and by the topological characterization of C(X) as a Baer-ring by Stone and Nakano in \cite[Theorem 3.25]{KM}, it is easy to see that C(X) is an SA-ring (resp., IN-ring) \ifif X is an extremally disconnected space. This result motivates the following questions: Question (1): What is X if for any two ideals I and J of C(X) which are generated by two subsets of idempotents, Ann(I)+Ann(J)=Ann(I\cap J)? Question (2): When does for any ideal I of C(X) exists a subset S of idempotents such that Ann(I)=Ann(S)? Along the line of answering these questions we introduce two classes of topological spaces. We call X an \textit{EF} (resp., \textit{EZ})-\textit{space} if disjoint unions of clopen sets are completely separated (resp., every regular closed subset is the closure of a union of clopen subsets). Topological properties of \textit{EF} (resp., \textit{EZ})-\textit{spaces} are investigated. As a consequence, a completely regular Hausdorff space X is an F_{\alpha}-space in the sense of Comfort and Negrepontis for each infinite cardinal \alpha \ifif X is an EF and EZ-space. Among other things, for a reduced ring R (resp., J(R)=0) we show that Spec(R) (resp., Max(R)) is an EZ-space \ifif for every ideal I of R there exists a subset S of idempotents of R such that Ann(I)=Ann(S).
