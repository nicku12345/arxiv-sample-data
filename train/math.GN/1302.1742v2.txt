We present a study of semigroup compactifications of a semitopological semigroup S using certain filters on S. We characterize closed subsemigroups and closed left, right, and two-sided ideals in any semigroup compactification of any semitopological semigroup S in terms of these filters and in terms of ideals of the corresponding m-admissible subalgebra of C(S). Furthermore, we characterize those points in any semigroup compactification of S which belong either to the smallest ideal of the semigroup compactification or to the closure of this smallest ideal.
