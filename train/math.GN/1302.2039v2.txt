For a space X denote by C_b(X) the Banach algebra of all continuous bounded scalar-valued functions on X and denote by C_0(X) the set of all elements in C_b(X) which vanish at infinity.   We prove that certain Banach subalgebras H of C_b(X) are isometrically isomorphic to C_0(Y), for some unique (up to homeomorphism) locally compact Hausdorff space Y. The space Y is explicitly constructed as a subspace of the Stone--\v{C}ech compactification of X. The known construction of Y enables us to examine certain properties of either H or Y and derive results not expected to be deducible from the standard Gelfand Theory.
