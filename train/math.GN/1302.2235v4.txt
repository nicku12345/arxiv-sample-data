Let X be a (topological) space and let {\mathscr I} be an ideal in X, that is, a collection of subsets of X which contains all subsets of its elements and is closed under finite unions. The elements of {\mathscr I} are called null. The space X is locally null if each x in X has a null neighborhood in X. Let C_b(X) denote the normed algebra of all continuous bounded real-valued mappings on X equipped with the supremum norm, C_0(X) denote the subalgebra of C_b(X) consisting of elements vanishing at infinity and C_{00}(X) the subalgebra of C_b(X) consisting of elements with compact support.   We study the normed subalgebra C^{\mathscr I}_{00}(X) of C_b(X) consisting of all f in C_b(X) whose support has a null neighborhood in X, and the Banach subalgebra C^{\mathscr I}_0(X) of C_b(X) consisting of all f in C_b(X) such that |f|^{-1}([1/n,\infty)) has a null neighborhood in X for all positive integer n. We prove that if X is a normal locally null space then C^{\mathscr I}_{00}(X) and C^{\mathscr I}_0(X) are respectively isometrically isomorphic to C_{00}(Y) and C_0(Y) for a unique locally compact Hausdorff space Y; furthermore, C^{\mathscr I}_{00}(X) is dense in C^{\mathscr I}_0(X). We construct Y explicitly as a subspace of the Stone--\v{C}ech compactification \beta X of X. The space Y is locally compact (and countably compact, in certain cases), contains X densely, and in specific cases turns out to be familiar subspaces of \beta X. The known topological structure of Y enables us to establish several commutative Gelfand--Naimark type theorems and derive results not generally expected to be deducible from the standard Gelfand theory.
