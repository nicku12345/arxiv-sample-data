We construct a functor AC(-,-) from the category of path connected spaces X with a base point x to the category of simply connected spaces. The following are the main results of the paper: (i) If X is a Peano continuum then AC(X,x) is a cell-like Peano continuum; (ii) If X is n-dimensional then AC(X, x) is (n+1)-dimensional; and (iii) For a path connected space X, \pi_1(X,x) is trivial if and only if \pi_2(AC(X, x)) is trivial. As a corollary, AC(S^1, x) is a 2-dimensional nonaspherical cell-like Peano continuum.
