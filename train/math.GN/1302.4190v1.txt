In this paper, we firstly construct a Hausdorff non-submetrizable paratopological group G in which every point is a G_{\delta}-set, which gives a negative answer to Arhangel'ski\v{\i}\ and Tkachenko's question [Topological Groups and Related Structures, Atlantis Press and World Sci., 2008]. We prove that each first-countable Abelian paratopological group is submetrizable. Moreover, we discuss developable paratopological groups and construct a non-metrizable, Moore paratopological group. Further, we prove that a regular, countable, locally k_{\omega}-paratopological group is a discrete topological group or contains a closed copy of S_{\omega}. Finally, we discuss some properties on non-H-closed paratopological groups, and show that Sorgenfrey line is not H-closed, which gives a negative answer to Arhangel'ski\v{\i}\ and Tkachenko's question [Topological Groups and Related Structures, Atlantis Press and World Sci., 2008]. Some questions are posed.
