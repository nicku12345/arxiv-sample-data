A space X is said to be \pi-metrizable if it has a \sigma-discrete \pi-base. In this paper, we mainly give affirmative answers for two questions about \pi-metrizable spaces. The main results are that: (1) A space X is \pi-metrizable if and only if X has a \sigma-hereditarily closure-preserving \pi-base; (2) X is \pi-metrizable if and only if X is almost \sigma-paracompact and locally \pi-metrizable; (3) Open and closed maps preserve \pi-metrizability; (4) \pi-metrizability satisfies hereditarily closure-preserving regular closed sum theorems. Moreover, we define the notions of second-countable \pi-metrizable and strongly \pi-metrizable spaces, and study some related questions. Some questions about strongly \pi-metrizability are posed.
