We mainly introduce some weak versions of the M_{1}-spaces, and study some properties about these spaces. The mainly results are that: (1) If X is a compact scattered space and i(X)\leq 3, then X is an s-m_{1}-space; (2) If X is a strongly monotonically normal space, then X is an s-m_{2}-space; (3) If X is a \sigma-m_{3} space, then t(X)\leq c(X), which extends a result of P.M. Gartside in \cite{CP}. Moreover, some questions are posed in the paper.
