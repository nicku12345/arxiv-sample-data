Suppose that X is a subspace of a Tychonoff space Y. Then the embedding mapping e_{X, Y}: X\rightarrow Y can be extended to a continuous monomorphism \hat{e}_{X, Y}: AP(X)\rightarrow AP(Y), where AP(X) and AP(Y) are the free Abelian paratopological groups over X and Y, respectively. In this paper, we mainly discuss when \hat{e}_{X, Y} is a topological monomorphism, that is, when \hat{e}_{X, Y} is a topological embedding of AP(X) to AP(Y).
