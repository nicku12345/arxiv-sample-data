We characterize exactly the compactness properties of the product of \kappa\ copies of the space \omega\ with the discrete topology. The characterization involves uniform ultrafilters, infinitary languages, and the existence of nonstandard elements in elementary estensions. We also have results involving products of possibly uncountable regular cardinals.
