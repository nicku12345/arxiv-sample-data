In each manifold M modeled on a finite or infinite dimensional cube [0,1]^n we construct a closed nowhere dense subset S\subset M (called a spongy set) which is a universal nowhere dense set in M in the sense that for each nowhere dense subset A\subset M there is a homeomorphism h:M\to M such that h(A)\subset S. The key tool in the construction of spongy sets is a theorem on topological equivalence of certain decompositions of manifolds. A special case of this theorem says that two vanishing cellular strongly shrinkable decompositions \mathcal A,\mathcal B of a Hilbert cube manifold M are topologically equivalent if any two non-singleton elements A\in\mathcal A and B\in\mathcal B of these decompositions are ambiently homeomorphic.
