We study and classify topologically invariant \sigma-ideals with a Borel base on the Hilbert cube and evaluate their cardinal characteristics. One of the results of this paper solves (positively) a known problem whether the minimal cardinalities of the families of Cantor sets covering the unit interval and the Hilbert cube are the same.
