The ultrametrization of the set of all probability measures of compact support on the ultrametric spaces was first defined by Hartog and de Vink. In this paper we consider a similar construction for the so called max-min measures on the ultrametric spaces. In particular, we prove that the functors max-min measures and idempotent measures are isomorphic. However, we show that this is not the case for the monads generated by these functors.
