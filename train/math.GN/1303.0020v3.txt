Denote by [0,\omega_1) the locally compact Hausdorff space consisting of all countable ordinals, equipped with the order topology, and let C_0[0,\omega_1) be the Banach space of scalar-valued, continuous functions which are defined on [0,\omega_1) and vanish eventually. We show that a weakly^* compact subset of the dual space of C_0[0,\omega_1) is either uniformly Eberlein compact, or it contains a homeomorphic copy of the ordinal interval [0,\omega_1].   Using this result, we deduce that a Banach space which is a quotient of C_0[0,\omega_1) can either be embedded in a Hilbert-generated Banach space, or it is isomorphic to the direct sum of C_0[0,\omega_1) and a subspace of a Hilbert-generated Banach space. Moreover, we obtain a list of eight equivalent conditions describing the Loy-Willis ideal, which is the unique maximal ideal of the Banach algebra of bounded, linear operators on C_0[0,\omega_1). As a consequence, we find that this ideal has a bounded left approximate identity, thus resolving a problem left open by Loy and Willis, and we give new proofs, in some cases of stronger versions, of several known results about the Banach space C_0[0,\omega_1) and the operators acting on it.
