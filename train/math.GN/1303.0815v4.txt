Let X be a product of topological spaces. X is sequentially compact if and only if all subproducts by \leq \mathfrak s factors are sequentially compact. If \mathfrak s = \mathfrak h, then X is sequentially compact if and only if all factors are sequentially compact and all but at most <\mathfrak s factors are ultraconnected. We give a topological proof of the inequality cf \mathfrak s \geq \mathfrak h. Recall that \mathfrak s denotes the splitting number, and \mathfrak h the distributivity number.   Parallel results are obtained for final  \omega_n-compactness and for other properties, as well as in the general context of a formerly introduced notion of compactness with respect to a set of filters. Some corresponding invariants are introduced.
