Generalised Sierpinski carpets are planar sets that generalise the well-known Sierpinski carpet and are defined by means of sequences of patterns. We study the structure of the sets at the kth iteration in the construction of the generalised carpet, for k greater than or equal to 1. Subsequently, we show that certain families of patterns provide total disconnectedness of the resulting generalised carpets. Moreover, analogous results hold even in a more general setting. Finally, we apply the obtained results in order to give an example of a totally disconnected generalised carpet with box-counting dimension 2.
