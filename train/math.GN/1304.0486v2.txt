We characterize the compactness properties of the product of \lambda\ copies of the space \omega\ with the discrete topology, dealing in particular with the case \lambda\ singular, using regular and uniform ultrafilters, infinitary languages and nonstandard elements. We also deal with products of uncountable regular cardinals with the order topology.
