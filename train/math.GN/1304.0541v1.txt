In this paper for superparacompact complete metrizable spaces the Freudenthal's theorem for compact irreducible standard polyhedric representation is generalized. Furthermore, for superparacompact metric spaces are reinforced: 1) the Morita's theorem about universality of the product Q^\infty\times B(\tau) of Hilbert cube Q^\infty to generalized Baire space B(\tau) of the weight \tau in the space of all strongly metrizable spaces of weight \le \tau; 2) the Nagata's theorem about universality of the product \Phi^n\times B(\tau) of universal n- dimensional compact \Phi^n to B(\tau) in the space of all strongly metrizable spaces \le\tau and dimension dimX\le n.
