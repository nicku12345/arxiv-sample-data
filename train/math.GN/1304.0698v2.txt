Jayne and Rogers proved that every function from an analytic space into a separable metric space is decomposable into countably many continuous functions with closed domains if and only if the preimage of each F_\sigma set under it is again F_\sigma. Many researchers conjectured that the Jayne-Rogers theorem can be generalized to all finite levels of Borel functions. In this paper, by using the Shore-Slaman join theorem on the Turing degrees, we show the following variant of the Jayne-Rogers theorem at finite and transfinite levels of the hierarchy of Borel functions: For all countable ordinals \alpha and \beta with \alpha\leq\beta<\alpha\cdot 2, every function between Polish spaces having small transfinite inductive dimension is decomposable into countably many Baire class \gamma functions with \mathbf{\Delta}^0_{\beta+1} domains such that \gamma+\alpha\leq\beta if and only if the preimage of each \mathbf{\Sigma}^0_{\alpha+1} set under that function is \mathbf{\Sigma}^0_{\beta+1}, and the transformation of a \mathbf{\Sigma}^0_{\alpha+1} set into the \mathbf{\Sigma}^0_{\beta+1} preimage is continuous.
