The bornological convergence structures that have been studied recently as generalizations of Attouch-Wets convergence define pretopologies on hyperspaces. In this paper we characterize the topological reflections of these pretopologies and translate the constructions necessary to define bornological convergence to a broader spectrum of hyperspace topologies.
