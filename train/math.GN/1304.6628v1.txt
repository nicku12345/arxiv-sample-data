The graph topology \tau_{\Gamma} is the topology on the space C(X) of all continuous functions defined on a Tychonoff space X inherited from the Vietoris topology on X\times \mathbb R after identifying continuous functions with their graphs. It is shown that all completeness properties between complete metrizability and hereditary Baireness coincide for the graph topology if and only if X is countably compact; however, the graph topology is \alpha-favorable in the strong Choquet game, regardless of X. Analogous results are obtained for the fine topology on C(X). Pseudocompleteness, along with properties related to 1st and 2nd countability of (C(X),\tau_{\Gamma}) are also investigated.
