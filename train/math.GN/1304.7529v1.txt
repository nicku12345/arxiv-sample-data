Given a multi-valued function \Phi on a topological space X we study the properties of its fixed fractal, which is defined as the closure of the orbit \Phi^\omega(Fix(\Phi))=\bigcup_{n\in\omega}\Phi^n(Fix(\Phi)) of the set Fix(\Phi)=\{x\in X:x\in\Phi(x)\} of fixed points of \Phi. A special attention is paid to the duality between micro-fractals and macro-fractals, which are fixed fractals for a contracting compact-valued function \Phi on a complete metric space X and its inverse multi-function \Phi^{-1}. With help of algorithms (described in this paper) we generate various images of macro-fractals which are dual to some well-known micro-fractals like the fractal cross, the Sierpinski triangle, Sierpinski carpet, the Koch curve, or the fractal snowflakes. The obtained images show that macro-fractals have a large-scale fractal structure, which becomes clearly visible after a suitable zooming.
