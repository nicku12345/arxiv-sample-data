Further extensions are given to the fixed point result (for implicit contractions) due to Altun and Simsek [Fixed Point Th. Appl., Volume 2010, Article ID 621469]. Some connections with related statements in the area due to Agarwal, El-Gebeily and O'Regan [Appl. Anal., 87 (2008), 109-116] are also discussed. Finally, the old approach in Turinici [An. St. Univ. "A. I. Cuza" Iasi, 22 (1976), 177-180] is presented, for historical reasons.
