For an infinite cardinal \kappa let \ell_2(\kappa) be the linear hull of the standard othonormal base of the Hilbert space \ell_2(\kappa) of density \kappa. We prove that a non-separable convex subset X of density \kappa in a locally convex linear metric space if homeomorphic to the space (i) \ell_2^f(\kappa) if and only if X can be written as countable union of finite-dimensional locally compact subspaces, (ii) [0,1]^\omega\times \ell_2^f(\kappa) if and only if X contains a topological copy of the Hilbert cube and X can be written as a countable union of locally compact subspaces.
