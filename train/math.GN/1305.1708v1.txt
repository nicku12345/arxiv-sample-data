In this paper, we construct round fold maps or stable fold maps with concentric singular value sets introduced by the author on smooth bundles over spheres or bundles over more general manifolds. The class of round fold maps includes special generic maps on spheres and such maps have been constructed on smooth bundles over standard spheres of dimensions larger than 1 and connected sums of smooth bundles over standard spheres of dimensions larger than 1 whose fibers are standard spheres, for example, in previous studies by the author. In this paper, we obtain round fold maps and the diffeomorphism types of their source manifolds which do not appear in these studies in new manners.
