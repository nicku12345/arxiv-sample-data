In this paper, we study Banach contractions in uniform spaces endowed with a graph and give some sufficient conditions for a mapping to be a Picard operator. Our main results generalize some results of [J. Jachymski, "The contraction principle for mappings on a metric space with a graph", Proc. Amer. Math. Soc. 136 (2008) 1359-1373] employing the basic entourages of the uniform space.
