A {\em blink} is a plane graph with an arbitrary bipartition of its edges. As a consequence of a recent result of Martelli, I show that the homeomorphisms classes of closed oriented 3-manifolds are in 1-1 correspondence with specific classes of blinks. In these classes, two blinks are equivalent if they are linked by a finite sequence of local moves, where each one appears in a concrete list of 64 moves: they organize in 8 types, each being essentially the same move on 8 simply related configurations. The size of the list can be substantially decreased at the cost of loosing symmetry, just by keeping a very simple move type, the {\em ribbon moves} denoted \pm \mu_{11}^{\pm} (which are in principle redundant). The inclusion of \pm \mu_{11}^{\pm} implies that all the moves corresponding to plane duality (the starred moves), except for \mu_{20}^\star and \mu_{02}^\star, are redundant and the coin calculus is reduced to 36 moves on 36 coins.   A {\em residual fraction link} or a {\em flink}, is a new object which generalizes {\em blackboard-framed link}. It plays an important role in this work. I try to make the topological exposition as complete as possible: about half of the exposition deals with the topological preliminaries. The objective is to make it easier for the combinatorially oriented readers to understand the paper. It is in the aegis of this work to find new important connections between 3-manifolds and plane graphs.
