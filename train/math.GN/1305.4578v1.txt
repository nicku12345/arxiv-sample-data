We introduce the notion of a (strongly) topological lattice \mathcal{L}=(L,\wedge ,\vee) with respect to a subset X\subsetneqq L; aprototype is the lattice of (two-sided) ideals of a ring R, which is(strongly) topological with respect to the prime spectrum of R. We investigate and characterize (strongly) topological lattices. Given a non-zero left R-module M, we introduce and investigate the spectrum \mathrm{Spec}^{\mathrm{f}}(M) of \textit{first submodules} of M. We topologize \mathrm{Spec}^{\mathrm{f}}(M) and investigate the algebraic properties of _{R}M by passing to the topological properties of the associated space.
