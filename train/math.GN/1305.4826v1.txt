\noindent The most natural group topology on \Z is the discrete one. There are other well-known group topologies on \Z, like the p-adic, defined for any prime number p. It is also an important group topology the weak topology with respect to the group of homomorphisms from \Z to the unit circle of the complex plane; that is, the one defined by the characters and which is known as "the Bohr topology" on \Z.   \noindent In \cite{tesislorenzo}, it is proved that taking as a neighbourhood basis at 0 the subsets \{W_n\mid n\in\N\}, defined by W_n:=\{k\in\Z\mid\forall x\in S,  k\cdot x\in[-\frac{1}{4n},\frac{1}{4n}]+\Z\}, where S is a quasi-convex sequence in \T, a group topology on \Z is obtained, \tau_S. We know that the topology \tau_S is metrizable and locally quasi-convex.   \noindent In this monograph we characterize convergent sequences in \tau_S, for some S\subset\T. We give sufficient conditions on the elements of \Z in order that they belong to a neighbourhood W_n. For a fixed sequence (b_n) of natural numbers, restricted to mild conditions, we have considered the "linear topology associated" whose neighbourhood basis at 0 is \{b_n\Z\mid n\in\N\} and the "topology of uniform convergence" on S=\{\frac{1}{b_n}+\Z\mid n\in\N\}\subset\T. We make a comparative study between both classes of topologies.
