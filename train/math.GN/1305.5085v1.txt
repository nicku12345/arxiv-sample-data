A poset P is called reversible if every order preserving bijective self map of P is an order automorphism. P is called hereditarily reversible if every subposet of P is reversible. We give a complete characterization of hereditarily reversible posets in terms of forbidden subsets. A similar result is stated also for preordered sets. As a corollary we extend the list of known examples of hereditarily reversible topological spaces.
