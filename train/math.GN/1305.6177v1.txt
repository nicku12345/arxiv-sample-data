We show that the Snake on a square SC(S^1) is homotopy equivalent to the space AC(S^1) which was investigated in the previous work by Eda, Karimov and Repov\vs. We also introduce related constructions CSC(-) and CAC(-) and investigate homotopical differences between these four constructions. Finally, we explicitly describe the second homology group of the Hawaiian tori wedge.
