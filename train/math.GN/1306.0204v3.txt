In this note we collect some known information and prove new results about the small uncountable cardinal \mathfrak q_0. The cardinal \mathfrak q_0 is defined as the smallest cardinality |A| of a subset A\subset \mathbb R which is not a Q-set (a subspace A\subset\mathbb R is called a Q-set if each subset B\subset A is of type F_\sigma in A). We present a simple proof of a folklore fact that \mathfrak p\le\mathfrak q_0\le\min\{\mathfrak b,\mathrm{non}(\mathcal N),\log(\mathfrak c^+)\}, and also establish the consistency of a number of strict inequalities between the cardinal \mathfrak q_0 and other standard small uncountable cardinals. This is done by combining some known forcing results. A new result of the paper is the consistency of \mathfrak{p} < \mathfrak{lr} < \mathfrak{q}_0, where \mathfrak{lr} denotes the linear refinement number. Another new result is the upper bound \mathfrak q_0\le\mathrm{non}(\mathcal I) holding for any \mathfrak q_0-flexible cccc \sigma-ideal \mathcal I on \mathbb R.
