In the paper we study pseudocompact primitive topological inverse semigroups. We describe the structure of pseudocompact primitive topological inverse semigroups and show that a Tychonoff product of a family of pseudocompact primitive topological inverse semigroups is a pseudocompact topological space. Also we prove that the Stone-\v{C}ech compactification of a pseudocompact primitive topological inverse semigroup is a compact primitive topological inverse semigroup.
