An MV-algebra (equivalently, a lattice-ordered Abelian group with a distinguished order unit) is strongly semisimple if all of its quotients modulo finitely generated congruences are semisimple. All MV-algebras satisfy a Chinese Reminder Theorem, as was first shown by Keimel four decades ago in the context of lattice-groups. In this note we prove that the Chinese Remainder Theorem admits a considerable strengthening for strongly semisimple structures.
