Let I be an infinite set, \{G_i:i\in I\} be a family of (topological) groups and G=\prod_{i\in I} G_i be its direct product. For J\subseteq I, p_{J}: G\to \prod_{j\in J} G_j denotes the projection. We say that a subgroup H of G is: (i) \emph{uniformly controllable} in G provided that for every finite set J\subseteq I there exists a finite set K\subseteq I such that p_{J}(H)=p_{J}(H\cap\bigoplus_{i\in K} G_i); (ii) \emph{controllable} in G provided that p_{J}(H)=p_{J}(H\cap\bigoplus_{i\in I} G_i) for every finite set J\subseteq I; (iii) \emph{weakly controllable} in G if H\cap \bigoplus_{i\in I} G_i is dense in H, when G is equipped with the Tychonoff product topology. One easily proves that (i)\to(ii)\to(iii). We thoroughly investigate the question as to when these two arrows can be reversed. We prove that the first arrow can be reversed when H is compact, but the second arrow cannot be reversed even when H is compact. Both arrows can be reversed if all groups G_i are finite. When G_i=A for all i\in I, where A is an abelian group, we show that the first arrow can be reversed for {\em all} subgroups H of G if and only if A is finitely generated. Connections with coding theory are highlighted.
