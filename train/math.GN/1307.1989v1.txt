It is well-known that every non-isolated point in a compact Hausdorff space is the accumulation point of a discrete subset. Answering a question raised by Z. Szentmiklossy and the first author, we show that this statement fails for countably compact regular spaces, and even for omega-bounded regular spaces. In fact, there are kappa-bounded counterexamples for every infinite cardinal kappa. The proof makes essential use of the so-called 'strong colorings' that were invented by the second author.
