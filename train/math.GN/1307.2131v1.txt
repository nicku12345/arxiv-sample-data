We give new axioms for the Lefschetz number based on Hadwiger's characterization of the Euler characteristic as the unique lattice valuation on polyhedra which takes value 1 on simplices. In the setting of maps on abstract simplicial complexes, we show that the Lefschetz number is unique with respect to a valuation axiom and an axiom specifying the value on a simplex. These axioms lead naturally to the classical computation of the Lefschetz number as a trace in homology. We then extend this approach to continuous maps of polyhedra, assuming an extra homotopy invariance axiom. We also show that this homotopy axiom can be weakened.
