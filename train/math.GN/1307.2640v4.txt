If \mathcal C is a class of complexes closed under taking full subcomplexes and covers and \mathcal G is the class of groups admitting proper and cocompact actions on one-connected complexes in \mathcal C, then \mathcal G is closed under taking finitely presented subgroups. As a consequence the following classes of groups are closed under taking finitely presented subgroups: groups acting geometrically on regular CAT(0) simplicial complexes of dimension 3, k-systolic groups for k\geq 6, and groups acting geometrically on 2-dimensional negatively curved complexes. We also show that there is a finite non-positively curved cubical 3-complex which is not homotopy equivalent to a finite non-positively curved regular simplicial 3-complex. We included other applications to relatively hyperbolic groups and diagramatically reducible groups. The main result is obtained by developing a notion of equivariant towers which is of independent interest.
