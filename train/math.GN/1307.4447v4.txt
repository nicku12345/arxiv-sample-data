Let M and N be two closed C^{\infty} manifolds and let \text{Diff}_c(M) denote the group of C^{\infty} diffeomorphisms isotopic to the identity. We prove that any (discrete) group homomorphism between \text{Diff}_c(M) and \text{Diff}_c(N) is continuous. We also show that a non-trivial group homomorphism \Phi: \text{Diff}_c(M) \to \text{Diff}_c(N) implies that \dim(M) \leq \dim(N) and give a classification of such homomorphisms when \dim(M) = \dim(N).
