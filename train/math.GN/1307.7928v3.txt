The two main results of this work are the following: if a space X is such that player II has a winning strategy in the game \gone(\Omega_x, \Omega_x) for every x \in X, then X is productively countably tight. On the other hand, if a space is productively countably tight, then \sone(\Omega_x, \Omega_x) holds for every x \in X. With these results, several other results follow, using some characterizations made by Uspenskii and Scheepers.
