Let (X,d) be a locally compact separable ultrametric space. We assume that (X,d) is proper, that is, any closed ball B in X is a compact set. Given a measure m on X and a function C(B) defined on the set of balls (the choice function), we define the hierarchical Laplacian L_C which is closely related to the concept of the hierarchical lattice of F.J. Dyson. L_C is a non-negative definite, self-adjoint operator in L^2(X,m). We address in this paper to the following question: How general can be the spectrum \mathsf{Spec}(L_C) as a subset of the non-negative reals? When (X,d) is compact, \mathsf{Spec}(L_C) is an increasing sequence of eigenvalues of finite multiplicity which contains 0. Assuming that (X,d) is not compact we show that, under some natural conditions concerning the structure of the hierarchical lattice (= the tree of d-balls), any given closed subset S of [0,\infty), which contains 0 as an accumulation point and is unbounded if X is non-discrete, may appear as \mathsf{Spec}(L_C) for some appropriately chosen function C(B). The operator -L_C extends to L^q(X,m), 0 < q < \infty, as Markov generator and its spectrum does not depend on q. As an example, we consider the operator \mathfrak{D}^{\alpha} of fractional derivative defined on the field \mathbb{Q}_p of p-adic numbers.
