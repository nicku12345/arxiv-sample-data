A space Y is called an extension of a space X if Y contains X as a dense subspace. An extension Y of X is called a one-point extension if Y-X is a singleton. Compact extensions are called compactifications and connected extensions are called connectifications.   It is well known that every locally compact non-compact space has a one-point compactification (known as the Alexandroff compactification) obtained by adding a point at infinity. A locally connected disconnected space, however, may fail to have a one-point connectification. It is indeed a long standing question of Alexandroff to characterize spaces which have a one-point connectification. Here we prove that in the class of completely regular spaces, a locally connected space has a one-point connectification if and only if it contains no compact component.
