The concept of an adapted homology basis for a prime order conformal automorphism of a compact Riemann surface extends to arbitrary finite groups of conformal automorphisms. Here we compute some examples of adapted homology bases for some groups of automorphisms. The method is to begin by apply the Schreier-Reidemeister rewriting process along with the Schreier-Reidemeister Theorem and then to eliminate generators and relations until there is one single large defining relation for the fundamental group in which every generator and its inverse occurs. We are then able to compute the action of the group on the homology image of these generators in the first homology group. The matrix of the action is in a simple form. This has applications to the representation variety.
