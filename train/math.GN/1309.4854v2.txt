Fold maps are higher dimensional versions of Morse functions, which play important roles in the studies of smooth manifolds, and such general maps also have been fundamental tools in the studies of smooth manifolds by using generic maps. In this paper, we study {\it simple} fold maps, which are fold maps such that any connected component of the inverse image of each singular value includes at most one singular point. More precisely, we consider simple fold maps having simple structures locally or globally and show that the source manifolds are bounded by (PL) manifolds obtained by considering the structures of maps under appropriate conditions. Such studies are regarded as extensions of results obtained by Saeki, Suzuoka etc. by 2005, which state that closed manifolds admitting simple fold maps and more generally stable maps into manifolds of lower dimensions without boundaries inverse images of whose regular values are always disjoint unions of spheres are bounded by compact manifolds obtained by observing the given maps.
