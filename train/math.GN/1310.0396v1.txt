We consider classes T of topological spaces (referred to as T-spaces) that are stable under continuous images and frequently under arbitrary products. A local T-space has for each point a neighborhood base consisting of subsets that are T-spaces in the induced topology. A general necessary and sufficient criterion for a product of topological spaces to be a local T-space in terms of conditions on the factors enables one to establish a broad variety of theorems saying that a product of spaces has a certain local property (like local compactness, local sequential compactness, local \sigma-compactness, local connectedness etc.) if and only if each factor has that local property, almost all have the corresponding global property, and not too many factors fail a suitable additional condition. Many of the results admit a point-free formulation; a look at sum decompositions into components of spaces with local properties yields product decompositions into indecomposable factors for certain classes of frames like completely distributive lattices or hypercontinuous frames.
