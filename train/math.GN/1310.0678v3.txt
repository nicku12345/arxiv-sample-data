The space S_\kappa is the Stone space of the \kappa-saturated Boolean algebra of cardinality \kappa. It exists provided that \kappa = \kappa^{<\kappa}, and is characterised topologically as the unique \kappa-Parovichenko space of weight \kappa. Under the Continuum Hypothesis, S_{\omega_1} coincides with \omega^*. This paper investigates questions related to the Stone-Cech compactification of spaces S_\kappa \setminus \{x\}, extending corresponding results obtained by Fine & Gillman and Comfort & Negrepontis for the space \omega^*.   We show that for every point x of S_\kappa, the Stone-Cech remainder of S_\kappa \setminus \{x\} is a \kappa^+-Parovichenko space of cardinality 2^{2^\kappa} which admits a family of 2^\kappa disjoint clopen sets. As a corollary we get that it is consistent with CH that the Stone-Cech remainders of \omega^* \setminus \{x\} are all homeomorphic.
