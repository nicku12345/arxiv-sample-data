Let X be a topological space and f:X\to X a bijection. Let {\mathcal C}(X,f) be a set of integers such that an integer n is an element of {\mathcal C}(X,f) if and only if the bijection f^n:X\to X is continuous. A subset S of the set of integers {\mathbb Z} is said to be realizable if there is a topological space X and a bijection f:X\to X such that S={\mathcal C}(X,f). A subset S of {\mathbb Z} containing 0 is called a submonoid of {\mathbb Z} if the sum of any two elements of S is also an element of S. We show that a subset S of {\mathbb Z} is realizable if and only if S is a submonoid of {\mathbb Z}. Then we generalize this result to any submonoid in any group.
