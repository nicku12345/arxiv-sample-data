Let G be a group, X be an infinite transitive G-space. A free ultrafilter \UU on X is called G-selective if, for any G-invariant partition \PP of X, either one cell of \PP is a member of \UU, or there is a member of \UU which meets each cell of \PP in at most one point. We show (Theorem 1) that in ZFC with no additional set-theoretical assumptions there exists a G-selective ultrafilter on X, describe all G-spaces X (Theorem 2) such that each free ultrafilter on X is G-selective, and prove (Theorem 3) that a free ultrafilter \UU on \omega is selective if and only if \UU is G-selective with respect to the action of any countable group G of permutations of \omega.   A free ultrafilter \UU on X is called G-Ramsey if, for any G-invariant coloring \chi:[G]^2 \to \{0,1\}, there is U\in \UU such that [U]^2 is \chi-monochrome. By Theorem 4, each G-Ramsey ultrafilter on X is G-selective. Theorems 5 and 6 give us a plenty of \mathbb{Z}-selective ultrafilters on \mathbb{Z} (as a regular \mathbb{Z}-space) but not \mathbb{Z}-Ramsey. We conjecture that each \mathbb{Z}-Ramsey ultrafilter is selective.
