Let X be an unbounded metric space, B(x,r) = \{y\in X: d(x,y) \leqslant r\} for all x\in X and r\geqslant 0. We endow X with the discrete topology and identify the Stone-\v{C}ech compactification \beta X of X with the set of all ultrafilters on X. Our aim is to reveal some features of algebra in \beta X similar to the algebra in the Stone-\v{C}ech compactification of a discrete semigroup \cite{b6}.   We denote X^# = \{p\in \beta X: \mbox{each}P\in p\mbox{is unbounded in}X\} and, for p,q \in X^#, write p\parallel q if and only if there is r \geqslant 0 such that B(Q,r)\in p for each Q\in q, where B(Q, r)=\cup_{x\in Q}B(x,r). A subset S\subseteq X^# is called invariant if p\in S and q\parallel p imply q\in S. We characterize the minimal closed invariant subsets of X, the closure of the set K(X^#) = \bigcup\{M : M\mbox{is a minimal closed invariant subset of}X^#\}, and find the number of all minimal closed invariant subsets of X^#.   For a subset Y\subseteq X and p\in X^#, we denote \bigtriangleup_p(Y) = Y^# \cap \{q\in X^#: p \parallel q\} and say that a subset S\subseteq X^# is an ultracompanion of Y if S = \bigtriangleup_p(Y) for some p\in X^#. We characterize large, thick, prethick, small, thin and asymptotically scattered spaces in terms of their ultracompanions.
