Let T be a topology on the finite set Xn. We consider the open polynomial associated with the topology T. Its coefficients are the cardinality of open sets of size j=0,...,n. J. Brown [4] asked when this polynomial has only real zeros. We prove that this polynomial has real zeros, only in the trivial case where T is the discrete topology. Then, we weaken Brown's question: for which topology this polynomial is log-concave, or at least unimodal? A partial answer is given. Precisely, we prove that if the topology has a large number of open sets, then its open polynomial is unimodal.
