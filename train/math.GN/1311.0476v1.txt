The following selection theorem is established:\\ Let X be a compactum possessing a binary normal subbase \mathcal S for its closed subsets. Then every set-valued \mathcal S-continuous map \Phi\colon Z\to X with closed \mathcal S-convex values, where Z is an arbitrary space, has a continuous single-valued selection. More generally, if A\subset Z is closed and any map from A to X is continuously extendable to a map from Z to X, then every selection for \Phi|A can be extended to a selection for \Phi.   This theorem implies that if X is a \kappa-metrizable (resp., \kappa-metrizable and connected) compactum with a normal binary closed subbase \mathcal S, then every open \mathcal S-convex surjection f\colon X\to Y is a zero-soft (resp., soft) map. Our results provide some generalizations and specifications of Ivanov's results (see \cite{i1}, \cite{i2}, \cite{i3}) concerning superextensions of \kappa-metrizable compacta.
