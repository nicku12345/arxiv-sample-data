A regular topological space X is defined to be a \mathfrak P_0-space if it has countable Pytkeev network. A network \mathcal N for X is called a Pytkeev network if for any point x\in X, neighborhood O_x\subset X of x and subset A\subset X accumulating at a x there is a set N\in\mathcal N such that N\subset O_x and N\cap A is infinite. The class of \mathfrak P_0-spaces contains all metrizable separable spaces and is (properly) contained in the Michael's class of \aleph_0-spaces. It is closed under many topological operations: taking subspaces, countable Tychonoff products, small countable box-products, countable direct limits, hyperspaces of compact subsets. For an \aleph_0-space X and a \mathfrak P_0-space Y the function space C_k(X,Y) endowed with the compact-open topology is a \mathfrak P_0-space. For any sequential \aleph_0-space X the free abelian topological group A(X) and the free locally convex linear topological space L(X) both are \mathfrak P_0-spaces. A sequential space is a \mathfrak P_0-space if and only if it is an \aleph_0-space. A topological space is metrizable and separable if and only if it is a \mathfrak P_0-space with countable fan tightness.
