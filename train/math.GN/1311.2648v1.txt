Let G be an abelian group, and F a downward directed family of subsets of G. The finest topology \mathcal{T} on G under which F converges to 0 has been described by I.Protasov and E.Zelenyuk. In particular, their description yields a criterion for \mathcal{T} to be Hausdorff. They then show that if F is the filter of cofinite subsets of a countable subset X\subseteq G, there is a simpler criterion: \mathcal{T} is Hausdorff if and only if for every g\in G-\{0\} and positive integer n, there is an S\in F such that g does not lie in the n-fold sum n(S\cup\{0\}\cup-S).   In this note, their proof is adapted to a larger class of families F. In particular, if X is any infinite subset of G, \kappa any regular infinite cardinal \leq\mathrm{card}(X), and F the set of complements in X of subsets of cardinality <\kappa, then the above criterion holds.   We then give some negative examples, including a countable downward directed set F of subsets of \mathbb{Z} not of the above sort which satisfies the "g\notin n(S\cup\{0\}\cup-S)" condition, but does not induce a Hausdorff topology.   We end with a version of our main result for noncommutative G.
