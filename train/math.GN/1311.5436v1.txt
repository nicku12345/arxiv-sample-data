We prove that under [CH], finite compactifications of \omega^* \setminus \{x\} are homeomorphic to \omega^*. Moreover, in each case, the remainder consists almost exclusively of P-points, apart from possibly one point.   Similar results are obtained for other, related classes of spaces, amongst them S_\kappa, the \kappa-Parovi\v{c}enko space of weight \kappa. Also, some parallels are drawn to the Cantor set and the Double Arrow space.
