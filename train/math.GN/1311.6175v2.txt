We study the semigroup \mathscr{I\!O}\!_{\infty}(\mathbb{Z}^n_{\operatorname{lex}}) of monotone injective partial selfmaps of the set of L_n\times_{\operatorname{lex}}\mathbb{Z} having co-finite domain and image, where L_n\times_{\operatorname{lex}}\mathbb{Z} is the lexicographic product of n-elements chain and the set of integers with the usual order. We show that \mathscr{I\!O}\!_{\infty}(\mathbb{Z}^n_{\operatorname{lex}}) is bisimple and establish its projective congruences. We prove that \mathscr{I\!O}\!_{\infty}(\mathbb{Z}^n_{\operatorname{lex}}) is finitely generated, and for n=1 every automorphism of \mathscr{I\!O}\!_{\infty}(\mathbb{Z}^n_{\operatorname{lex}}) is inner and show that in the case n\geqslant 2 the semigroup \mathscr{I\!O}\!_{\infty}(\mathbb{Z}^n_{\operatorname{lex}}) has non-inner automorphisms. Also we show that every Baire topology \tau on \mathscr{I\!O}\!_{\infty}(\mathbb{Z}^n_{\operatorname{lex}}) such that (\mathscr{I\!O}\!_{\infty}(\mathbb{Z}^n_{\operatorname{lex}}),\tau) is a Hausdorff semitopological semigroup is discrete, construct a non-discrete Hausdorff semigroup inverse topology on \mathscr{I\!O}\!_{\infty}(\mathbb{Z}^n_{\operatorname{lex}}), and prove that the discrete semigroup \mathscr{I\!O}\!_{\infty}(\mathbb{Z}^n_{\operatorname{lex}}) cannot be embedded into some classes of compact-like topological semigroups and that its remainder under the closure in a topological semigroup S is an ideal in S.
