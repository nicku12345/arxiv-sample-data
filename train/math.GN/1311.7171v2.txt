We define the regular Euclidean algorithm and the general form which leads to the method of least absolute remainders and also the method of negative remainders. We are going to show that if looked from the perspective of subtraction, the method of least absolute remainders and the regular method have the same number of steps which is in fact the minimal number of steps possible. This enables us to apply the theory in rational tangles to determine the most efficient way to untangle a rational tangle.
