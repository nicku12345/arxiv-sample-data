This paper investigates topological reconstruction, related to the reconstruction conjecture in graph theory. We ask whether the homeomorphism types of subspaces of a space X which are obtained by deleting singletons determine X uniquely up to homeomorphism. If the question can be answered affirmatively, such a space is called reconstructible.   We prove that in various cases topological properties can be reconstructed. As main result we find that familiar spaces such as the reals \mathbb{R}, the rationals \mathbb{Q} and the irrationals P are reconstructible, as well as spaces occurring as Stone-Cech compactifications. Moreover, some non-reconstructible spaces are discovered, amongst them the Cantor set C.
