In a recent paper, Garc\'{\i}a-Velazquez has extended the notion of Whitney map to include maps with non-metrizable codomain and left open the question of whether there is a continuum that admits such a Whitney map. In this paper, we consider two examples of hereditarily indecomposable, chainable continua of weight \omega_1 constructed by Michel Smith; we show that one of them admits a Whitney function onto the long arc and the other admits no Whitney maps at all.
