Given a metric space \langle X,\rho \rangle, consider its hyperspace of closed sets CL(X) with the Wijsman topology \tau_{W(\rho)}. It is known that \langle{CL(X),\tau_{W(\rho)}}\rangle is metrizable if and only if X is separable and it is an open question by Di Maio and Meccariello whether this is equivalent to \langle{CL(X),\tau_{W(\rho)}}\rangle being normal. In this paper we prove that if the weight of X is a regular uncountable cardinal and X is locally separable, then \langle{CL(X),\tau_{W(\rho)}}\rangle is not normal. We also solve some questions by Cao, Junnilla and Moors regarding isolated points in Wijsman hyperspaces.
