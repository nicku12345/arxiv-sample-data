We study Borel ideals I on \mathbb{N} with the Fr\'echet property such its orthogonal I^\perp is also Borel (where A\in I^\perp iff A\cap B is finite for all B\in I and I is Fr\'echet if I=I^{\perp\perp}). Let \mathcal{B} be the smallest collection of ideals on {\mathbb{N}} containing the ideal of finite sets and closed under countable direct sums and orthogonal. All ideals in \mathcal{B} are Fr\'echet, Borel and have Borel orthogonal. We show that \mathcal{B} has exactly \aleph_1 non isomorphic members. The family \mathcal{B} can be characterized as the collection of all Borel ideals which are isomorphic to an ideal of the form I_{wf}\up A, where I_{wf} is the ideal on \mathbb{N}^{<\omega} generated by the wellfounded trees. Also, we show that A\subseteq \mathbb{Q} is scattered iff WO({\mathbb{Q}})\up A is isomorphic to an ideal in \mathcal{B}, where WO(\mathbb{Q}) is the ideal of well founded subset of \mathbb{Q}.
