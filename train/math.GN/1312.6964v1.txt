First of all, we focused soft {\beta}-open sets and soft {\beta}-closed sets over the soft topological space and investigated some properties of them. Secondly, we defined the concepts soft {\beta}-continuity, soft {\beta}-irresolute and soft {\beta}-homeomorphism on soft topological spaces. We also obtained some characterizations of these mappings. Finally, we observed that the collection S{\beta}r-h(X,{\tau},E) was a soft group.
