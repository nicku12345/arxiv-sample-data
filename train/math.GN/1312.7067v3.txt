Without assuming the field structure on the additive group of real numbers \mathbb{R} with the usual order <, we explore the fact that every proper subgroup of \mathbb{R} is either closed or dense. This property of subgroups of the additive group of reals is special and well known (see Abels and Monoussos [4]). However, by revisiting it, we provide another direct proof. We also generalize this result to arbitrary topological groups in the sense that, any topological group having this property of the subgroups in a given topology is either connected or totally disconnected.
