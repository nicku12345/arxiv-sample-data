We have initiated the study of topology of the space of coverings on grid domains. The space has the following constraint: while all the covering agents can move freely (we allow overlapping) on the domain, their union must cover the whole domain. A minimal number N of the covering agents is required for a successful covering of the domain. In this paper, we demonstrate beautiful topological structures of this space on grid domains in 2D with N+1 coverings, the topology of the space has the homotopy type of 1 dimensional complex, regardless of the domain shape. We also present the Euler characteristic formula which connects the topology of the space with that of the domain itself.
