In this paper we introduce the notion of \mathcal I^{\mathcal K}-Cauchy function, where \mathcal I and \mathcal K are ideals on the same set. The \mathcal I^{\mathcal K}-Cauchy functions are a generalization of \mathcal I^*-Cauchy sequences and \mathcal I^*-Cauchy nets. We show how this notion can be used to characterize complete uniform spaces and we study how \mathcal I^{\mathcal K}-Cauchy functions and \mathcal I-Cauchy functions are related. We also define and study \mathcal I^{\mathcal K}-divergence of functions.
