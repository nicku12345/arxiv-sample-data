Let \mathsf{F}_r be a free group of rank r, \mathbb{F}_q a finite field of order q, and let \mathrm{SL}_n(\mathbb{F}_q) act on \mathrm{Hom}(\mathsf{F}_r, \mathrm{SL}_n(\mathbb{F}_q)) by conjugation. We describe a general algorithm to determine the cardinality of the set of orbits \mathrm{Hom}(\mathsf{F}_r, \mathrm{SL}_n(\mathbb{F}_q))/\mathrm{SL}_n(\mathbb{F}_q). Our first main theorem is the implementation of this algorithm in the case n=2. As an application, we determine the E-polynomial of the character variety \mathrm{Hom}(\mathsf{F}_r, \mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{C}))//!/\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{C}), and of its smooth and singular locus. Thus we determine the Euler characteristic of these spaces.
