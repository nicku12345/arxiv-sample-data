For every functional functor F:Comp\to Comp in the category Comp of compact Hausdorff spaces we define the notions of F-Dugundji and F-Milutin spaces, generalizing the classical notions of a Dugundji and Milutin spaces. We prove that the class of F-Dugundji spaces coincides with the class of absolute F-valued retracts. Next, we show that for a monomorphic continuous functor F:Comp\to Comp admitting tensor products each Dugundji compact is an absolute F-valued retract if and only if the doubleton \{0,1\} is an absolute F-valued retract if and only if some points a\in F(\{0\})\subset F(\{0,1\}) and b\in F(\{1\})\subset F(\{0,1\}) can be linked by a continuous path in F(\{0,1\}). We prove that for the functor Lip_k of k-Lipschitz functionals with k<2, each absolute Lip_k-valued retract is openly generated. On the other hand the one-point compactification of any uncountable discrete space is not openly generated but is an absolute Lip_3-valued retract. More generally, each hereditarily paracompact scattered compact space X of finite scattered height n is an absolute Lip_k-valued retract for k=2^{n+2}-1.
