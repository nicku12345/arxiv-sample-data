Let G be a compact group acting on a Banach space L by means of linear isometries. The action of G on L induces a natural continuous action on cc(L), the hyperspace of all compact convex subsets of L endowed with the Hausdorff metric topology. The main result of this paper states that the G-space cc(L) is a G-AE. Under some extra assumptions, this result can be extended to CB(L), the hyperspace of all closed and bounded convex subsets of L.
