We introduce a notion of graph homeomorphisms which uses the concept of dimension and homotopy for graphs. It preserves the dimension of a subbasis, cohomology and Euler characteristic. Connectivity and homotopy look as in classical topology. The Brouwer-Lefshetz fixed point leads to the following discretiszation of the Kakutani fixed point theorem: any graph homeomorphism T with nonzero Lefschetz number has a nontrivial invariant open set which is fixed by T.
