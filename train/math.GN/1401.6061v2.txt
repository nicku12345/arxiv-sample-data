It is well known that if the nonempty player of the Banach-Mazur game has a winning strategy on a space, then that space is Baire in all powers even in the box topology. The converse of this implication may be true also: We know of no consistency result to the contrary. In this paper we establish the consistency of the converse relative to the consistency of the existence of a proper class of measurable cardinals.
