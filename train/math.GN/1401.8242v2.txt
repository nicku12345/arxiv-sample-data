We extend the existing enumeration of neck tie-knots to include tie-knots with a textured front, tied with the narrow end of a tie. These tie-knots have gained popularity in recent years, based on reconstructions of a costume detail from The Matrix Reloaded, and are explicitly ruled out in the enumeration by Fink and Mao (2000).   We show that the relaxed tie-knot description language that comprehensively describes these extended tie-knot classes is context free. It has a regular sub-language that covers all the knots that originally inspired the work.   From the full language, we enumerate 266 682 distinct tie-knots that seem tie-able with a normal neck-tie. Out of these 266 682, we also enumerate 24 882 tie-knots that belong to the regular sub-language.
