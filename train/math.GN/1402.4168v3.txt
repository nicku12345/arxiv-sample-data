Let G, R and A be topological groups. Suppose that G and R act continuously on A, and G acts continuously on R. In this paper, we define a partially crossed topological G-R-bimodule (A,\mu), where \mu:A\rightarrow R is a continuous homomorphism. Let Der_{c}(G,(A,\mu)) be the set of all (\alpha,r) such that \alpha:G\rightarrow A is a continuous crossed homomorphism and \mu\alpha(g)=r^{g}r^{-1}. We introduce a topology on Der_{c}(G,(A,\mu)). We show that Der_{c}(G,(A,\mu)) is a topological group, wherever G and R are locally compact. We define the first cohomology, H^{1}(G,(A,\mu)), of G with coefficients in (A,\mu) as a quotient space of Der_{c}(G,(A,\mu)). Also, we state conditions under which H^{1}(G,(A,\mu)) is a topological group. Finally, we show that under what conditions H^{1}(G,(A,\mu)) is one of the following: k-space, discrete, locally compact and compact.
