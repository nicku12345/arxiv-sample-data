Molodtsov initiated the concept of soft sets in Molodtsov D. Maji et al. defined some operations on soft sets in Maji P. K., Bismas R., Roy A. R. The concept of soft topological space was introduced by some authors. In this paper, we introduce the concept of the pointwise topology of soft topological spaces and the properties of soft mappings spaces. Finally, we investigate the relationships between some soft mappings spaces.
