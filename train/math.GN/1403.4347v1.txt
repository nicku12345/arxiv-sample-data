We specify a result of Yokoi \cite{yo} by proving that if G is an abelian group and X is a homogeneous metric ANR compactum with \dim_GX=n and \check{H}^n(X;G)\neq 0, then X is an (n,G)-bubble. This implies that any such space X has the following properties: \check{H}^{n-1}(A;G)\neq 0 for every closed separator A of X, and X is an Alexandroff manifold with respect to the class D^{n-2}_G of all spaces of dimension \dim_G\leq n-2. We also prove that if X is a homogeneous metric continuum with \check{H}^n(X;G)\neq 0, then \check{H}^{n-1}(C;G)\neq 0 for any partition C of X such that \dim_GC\leq n-1. The last provides a partial answer to a question of Kallipoliti and Papasoglu \cite{kp}.
