In this paper, we continue the study of function spaces equipped with topologies of (strong) uniform convergence on bornologies initiated by Beer and Levi \cite{beer-levi:09}. In particular, we investigate some topological properties these function spaces defined by topological games. In addition, we also give further characterizations of metrizability and completeness properties of these function spaces.
