A direction in a Type I space X=\cup_{\alpha<\omega_1}X_\alpha is a closed and unbounded subset D of X such that given any continuous f:X\to\mathbb{L}_{\ge 0} (the closed long ray), if f is unbounded on D then f is unbounded on each unbounded subset of D. A closed copy of \omega_1 is a direction in any Type I space. We study various aspects of directions and show some independence results. A sample: There is an \omega-bounded Type I space without direction; PFA implies that a locally compact countably tight \omega_1-compact Type I space contains a direction; if there is a Suslin tree then there is an \omega_1-compact Type I manifold without direction; there are Type I first countable spaces which contain directions and whose closed unbounded subsets contain each a closed unbounded discrete subset. We also study a naturel order on the directions of a given space and show that we may obtain various classical ordered types with the space a manifold (often \omega-bounded).
