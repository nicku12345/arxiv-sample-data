Local versions of measurability have been around for a long time. Roughly, one splits the notion of \mu -completeness into pieces, and asks for a uniform ultrafilter over \mu  satisfying just some piece of \mu -completeness.   Analogue local versions of weak compactness are harder to come by, since weak compactness cannot be defined by using a single ultrafilter. We deal with the problem by restricting just to a subset P of all the partitions of \mu  into <\mu  classes and asking for some ultrafilter D over \mu  such that no partition in P disproves the \mu -completeness of D. By making P vary in appropriate classes, one gets both measurability and weak compactness, as well as possible intermediate notions of "weak measurability".   We systematize the above procedures and combine them to obtain variants of measurability which are at the same time weaker and local. Of particular interest is the fact that the notions thus obtained admit equivalent formulations through topological, model theoretical, combinatorial and Boolean algebraic conditions. We also hint a connection with Kat{\v{e}}tov order on filters.
