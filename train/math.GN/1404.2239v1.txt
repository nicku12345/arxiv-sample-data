The \emph{linear refinement number} \mathfrak{lr} is the minimal cardinality of a centered family in [\omega]^\omega such that no linearly ordered set in ([\omega]^\omega,\subseteq^*) refines this family. The \emph{linear excluded middle number} \mathfrak{lx} is a variation of \mathfrak{lr}. We show that these numbers estimate the critical cardinalities of a number of selective covering properties. We compare these numbers to the classic combinatorial cardinal characteristics of the continuum. We prove that \mathfrak{lr}=\mathfrak{lx}=\mathfrak{fd} in all models where the continuum is at most \aleph_2, and that the cofinality of \mathfrak{lr} is uncountable. Using the method of forcing, we show that \mathfrak{lr} and \mathfrak{lx} are not provably equal to \mathfrak{d}, and rule out several potential bounds on these numbers. Our results solve a number of open problems.
