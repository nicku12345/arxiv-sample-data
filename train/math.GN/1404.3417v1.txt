Some properties of skelatally generated spaces are established. In particular, it is shown that any compactum co-absolute to a \kappa-metrizable compactum is skeletally generated. We also prove that a compactum X is skeletally generated if and only if its superextension \lambda X is skeletally Dugundji and raise some natural questions.
