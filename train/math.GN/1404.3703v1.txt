We introduce the notion of a coherent P-ultrafilter on a complete ccc Boolean algebra, strenghtening the notion of a P-point on \omega, and show that these ultrafilters exist generically under {\mathfrak c} = {\mathfrak d}. This improves the known existence result of Ketonen. Similarly, the existence theorem of Canjar can be extended to show that coherently selective ultrafilters exist generically under {\mathfrak c} = {cov(M)}.   We use these ultrafilters in a topological application: a coherent P-ultrafilter on an algebra B is an untouchable point in the Stone space of B, witnessing its nonhomogeneity.
