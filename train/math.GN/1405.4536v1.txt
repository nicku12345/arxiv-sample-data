The PPF dependent fixed point result in algebraically closed Razumikhin classes due to Agarwal et al [Fixed Point Theory Appl., 2013, 2013:280] is identical with its constant class counterpart; and this, in turn, is reducible to a fixed point principle involving SVV type contractions (over the subsequent metric space of initial Banach structure), without any regularity conditions about the Razumikhin classes. The conclusion remains valid for all PPF dependent fixed point results founded on such global conditions.
