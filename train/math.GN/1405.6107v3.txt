Michael asked whether every productively Lindel\"of space is powerfully Lindel\"of. Building of work of Alster and De la Vega, assuming the Continuum Hypothesis, we show that every productively Lindel\"of space of countable tightness is powerfully Lindel\"of. This strengthens a result of Tall and Tsaban. The same methods also yield new proofs of results of Arkhangel'skii and Buzyakova. Furthermore, assuming the Continuum Hypothesis, we show that a productively Lindel\"of space X is powerfully Lindel\"of if every open cover of X^\omega admits a point-continuum refinement consisting of basic open sets. This strengthens a result of Burton and Tall. Finally, we show that separation axioms are not relevant to Michael's question: if there exists a counterexample (possibly not even \mathsf{T}_0), then there exists a regular (actually, zero-dimensional) counterexample.
