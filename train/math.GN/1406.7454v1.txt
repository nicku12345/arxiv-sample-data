This is the second of three articles on the topic of truncation as an operation on divisible abelian lattice-ordered groups, or simply \ell-groups. This article uses the notation and terminology of the first article and assumes its results. In particular, we refer to an \ell-group with truncation as a truncated \ell-group, or simply a trunc, and denote the category of truncs with truncation morphisms by \mathbf{AT}.   Here we develop the analog for \mathbf{AT} of Madden's pointfree representation for \mathbf{W}, the category of archimedean \ell-groups with designated order unit. More explicitly, for every archimedean trunc A there is a regular Lindel\"{o}f frame L equipped with a designated point \ast : L \rightarrow 2, a subtrunc \widehat{A} of \mathcal{R}_{0}L, the trunc of pointed frame maps \mathcal{O}_{0}\mathbb{R}\rightarrow L, and a trunc isomorphism A\rightarrow\widehat{A}. A pointed frame map is just a frame map between frames which commutes with their designated points, and \mathcal{O}_{0}\mathbb{R} stands for the pointed frame which is the topology \mathcal{O}\mathbb{R} of the real numbers equipped with the frame map of the insertion 0 \to \mathbb{R}. \left( L,\ast\right)  is unique up to pointed frame isomorphism with respect to its properties. Finally, we reprove an important result from the first article, namely that \mathbf{W} is a non-full monoreflective subcategory of \mathbf{AT}.
