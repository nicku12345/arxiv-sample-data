For a group G first order definable in a structure M, we continue the study of the "definable topological dynamics" of G. The special case when all subsets of G are definable in the given structure M is simply the usual topological dynamics of the discrete group G; in particular, in this case, the words "externally definable" and "definable" can be removed in the results described below.   Here we consider the mutual interactions of three notions or objects: a certain model-theoretic invariant G^{*}/(G^{*})^{000}_{M} of G, which appears to be "new" in the classical discrete case and of which we give a direct description in the paper; the [externally definable] generalized Bohr compactification of G; [externally definable] strong amenability. Among other things, we essentially prove: (i) The "new" invariant G^{*}/(G^{*})^{000}_{M} lies in between the externally definable generalized Bohr compactification and the definable Bohr compactification, and these all coincide when G is definably strongly amenable and all types in S_G(M) are definable, (ii) the kernel of the surjective homomorphism from G^*/(G^*)^{000}_M to the definable Bohr compactification has naturally the structure of the quotient of a compact (Hausdorff) group by a dense normal subgroup, and (iii) when Th(M) is NIP, then G is [externally] definably amenable iff it is externally definably strongly amenable.   In the situation when all types in S_G(M) are definable, one can just work with the definable (instead of externally definable) objects in the above results.
