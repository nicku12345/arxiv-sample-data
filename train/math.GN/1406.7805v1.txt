Given a property P of subspaces of a T_1 space X, we say that X is {\em P-bounded} iff every subspace of X with property P has compact closure in X. Here we study P-bounded spaces for the properties P \in \{\omega D, \omega N, C_2 \} where \omega D \, \equiv "countable discrete", \omega N \, \equiv "countable nowhere dense", and C_2 \,\equiv "second countable". Clearly, for each of these P-bounded is between countably compact and \omega-bounded.   We give examples in ZFC that separate all these boundedness properties and their appropriate combinations. Consistent separating examples with better properties (such as: smaller cardinality or weight, local compactness, first countability) are also produced.   We have interesting results concerning \omega D-bounded spaces which show that \omega D-boundedness is much stronger than countable compactness:   \bullet Regular \omega D-bounded spaces of Lindel\"of degree < cov(\mathcal{M}) are \omega-bounded.   \bullet Regular \omega D-bounded spaces of countable tightness are \omega N-bounded, and if \mathfrak{b} > \omega_1 then even \omega-bounded.   \bullet If a product of Hausdorff space is \omega D-bounded then all but one of its factors must be \omega-bounded.   \bullet Any product of at most \mathfrak{t} many Hausdorff \omega D-bounded spaces is countably compact.   As a byproduct we obtain that regular, countably tight, and countably compact spaces are discretely generated.
