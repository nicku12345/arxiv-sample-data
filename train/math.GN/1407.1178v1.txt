It is proved that, for a wide class of topological abelian groups (locally quasi--convex groups for which the canonical evaluation from the group into its Pontryagin bidual group is onto) the arc component of the group is exactly the union of the one--parameter subgroups. We also prove that for metrizable separable locally arc-connected reflexive groups, the exponential map from the Lie algebra into the group is open.
