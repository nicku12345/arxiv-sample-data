The epireflective subcategories of {\bold{Top}}, that are closed under epimorphic (or bimorphic) images, are \{X \mid |X| \le 1 \} , \{X \mid X is indiscrete\}  and {\bold{Top}}. The epireflective subcategories of {\bold{T_2Unif}}, closed under epimorphic images, are: \{X \mid |X| \le 1 \} , \{X \mid X is compact T_2 \} , \{X \mid  covering character of X is  \le \lambda_0 \}  (where \lambda_0 is an infinite cardinal), and {\bold{T_2Unif}}. The epireflective subcategories of {\bold{Unif}}, closed under epimorphic (or bimorphic) images, are: \{X \mid |X| \le 1 \} , \{X \mid X is indiscrete\} , \{X \mid  covering character of X is  \le \lambda_0 \}  (where \lambda_0 is an infinite cardinal), and {\bold{Unif}}. The epireflective subcategories of {\bold{Top}}, that are algebraic categories, are \{X \mid |X| \le 1 \} , and \{X \mid X is indiscrete\} . The subcategories of {\bold{Unif}}, closed under products and closed subspaces and being varietal, are \{X \mid |X| \le 1 \} , \{X \mid X is indiscrete\} , \{X \mid X is compact T_2 \} . The subcategories of {\bold{Unif}}, closed under products and closed subspaces and being algebraic, are \{X \mid X is indiscrete \} , and all epireflective subcategories of \{X \mid X is compact T_2 \} . Also we give a sharpened form of a theorem of Kannan-Soundararajan about classes of T_3 spaces, closed for products, closed subspaces and surjective images.
