We give a characterization of those abelian groups which are direct sums of cyclic groups and the Jacobson radical of their endomorphism rings are closed. A complete characterization of p-groups A for which (EndA,\mathcal T_L) is locally compact, where \mathcal T_L is the Liebert topology on EndA, is given. We prove that if A is a countable elementary p-group then EndA has a non-admissible ring topology. To every functorial topology on A a right bounded ring topology on EndA is attached. By using this topology we construct on EndA a non-metrizable and non-admissibe ring topology on EndA for elementary countable p-groups A.
