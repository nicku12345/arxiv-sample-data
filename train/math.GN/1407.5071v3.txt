In this paper we introduce a new definition of the first non-abelian cohomology of topological groups. We relate the cohomology of a normal subgroup N of a topological group G and the quotient G/N to the cohomology of G. We get the inflation-restriction exact sequence. Also, we obtain a seven-term exact cohomology sequence up to dimension 2. We give an interpretation of the first non-abelian cohomology of a topological group by the notion of a principle homogeneous space.
