A function f:X\to Y between topological spaces is said to be a {\it weakly Gibson function} if f(\overline{G})\subseteq \overline{f(G)} for any open connected set \mbox{G\subseteq X}. We call a function f:X\to Y {\it segmentary connected} if X is topological vector space and f([a,b]) is connected for every segment [a,b]\subseteq X. We show that if X is a hereditarily Baire space, Y is a metric space, \mbox{f:X\to Y} is a Baire-one function and one of the following conditions holds: (i) X is a connected and locally connected space and f is a weakly Gibson function, (ii) X is an arcwise connected space and f is a Darboux function, (iii) X is a topological vector space and f is a segmentary connected function, then f has a connected graph.
