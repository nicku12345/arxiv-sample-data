A space X has countable (F)-property if it has countable point network satisfying the Collins-Roscoe structuring mechanism. Some sufficient conditions for C_p(X) having countable (F)-property are obtained. As a corollary, we prove that if X is Corson compact, C_p(X) satisfies countable (F). This answers a question raised by Tkachuk. Also we get a class of function spaces with hereditarily D-property. We also prove that the countable (F)-property is preserved by taking \Sigma_s-product. This answers questions of Tkachuk positively.
