For every metric space X we introduce two cardinal characteristics \mathrm{cov}^\flat(X) and \mathrm{cov}^\sharp(X) describing the capacity of balls in X. We prove that these cardinal characteristics are invariant under coarse equivalence and prove that two ultrametric spaces X,Y are coarsely equivalent if \mathrm{cov}^\flat(X)=\mathrm{cov}^\sharp(X)=\mathrm{cov}^\flat(Y)=\mathrm{cov}^\sharp(Y). This result implies that an ultrametric space X is coarsely equivalent to an isometrically homogeneous ultrametric space if and only if \mathrm{cov}^\flat(X)=\mathrm{cov}^\sharp(X). Moreover, two isometrically homogeneous ultrametric spaces X,Y are coarsely equivalent if and only if \mathrm{cov}^\sharp(X)=\mathrm{cov}^\sharp(Y) if and only if each of these spaces coarsely embeds into the other space. This means that the coarse structure of an isometrically homogeneous ultrametric space X is completely determined by the value of the cardinal \mathrm{cov}^\sharp(X)=\mathrm{cov}^\flat(X).
