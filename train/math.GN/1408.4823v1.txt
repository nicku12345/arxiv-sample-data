Hu's metrization theorem for bornological universes is shown to hold in ZF and it is adapted to a quasi-metrization theorem for bornologies in bitopological spaces. The problem of uniform quasi-metrization of quasi-metric bornological universes is investigated. Several consequences for natural bornologies in generalized topological spaces in the sense of Delfs and Knebusch are deduced. Some statements concerning (uniform)-(quasi)-metrization of bornologies are shown to be relatively independent of ZF.
