We show that the SO(3) monopole cobordism formula from Feehan and Leness (2002) implies that all smooth, closed, oriented four-manifolds with b^1=0 and b^+\geq 3 and odd with Seiberg-Witten simple type satisfy the superconformal simple type condition defined by Marino, Moore, and Peradze (1999) This implies the lower bound, conjectured by Fintushel and Stern (2001) on the number of Seiberg-Witten basic classes in terms of topological data.
