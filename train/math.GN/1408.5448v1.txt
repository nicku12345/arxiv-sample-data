We consider a class of "harmonic variations" for nonsingular curves, obtained as asymptotic degenerations along bitangents. On a geometric level, we obtain an attractive relationship between the class and the genus of C. The distribution of class points in pairs across nonsingular curves with such variations, further suggests applications to understanding covalent bonding in terms of shared electrons.
