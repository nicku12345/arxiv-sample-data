For every ballean X we introduce two cardinal characteristics cov^\flat(X) and cov^\sharp(X) describing the capacity of balls in X. We observe that these cardinal characteristics are invariant under coarse equivalence and prove that two cellular ordinal balleans X,Y are coarsely equivalent if cof(X)=cof(Y) and cov^\flat(X)=cov^\sharp(X)=cov^\flat(Y)=cov^\sharp(Y). This result implies that a cellular ordinal ballean X is homogeneous if and only if cov^\flat(X)=cov^\sharp(X). Moreover, two homogeneous cellular ordinal balleans X,Y are coarsely equivalent if and only if cof(X)=cof(Y) and cov^\sharp(X)=cov^\sharp(Y) if and only if each of these balleans coarsely embeds into the other ballean. This means that the coarse structure of a homogeneous cellular ordinal ballean X is fully determined by the values of the cardinals cof(X) and cov^\sharp(X). For every limit ordinal \gamma we shall define a ballean 2^{<\gamma} (called the Cantor macro-cube), which in the class of cellular ordinal balleans of cofinality cf(\gamma) plays a role analogous to the role of the Cantor cube 2^{\kappa} in the class of zero-dimensional compact Hausdorff spaces. We shall also present a characterization of balleans which are coarsely equivalent to 2^{<\gamma}. This characterization can be considered as an asymptotic analogue of Brouwer's characterization of the Cantor cube 2^\omega.
