Let X be a zero-dimensional compact metrizable space endowed with a strictly positive continuous Borel \sigma-additive measure \mu which is good in the sense that for any clopen subsets U,V\subset X with \mu(U)<\mu(V) there is a clopen set W\subset V with \mu(W)=\mu(U). We study \sigma-ideals with Borel base on X which are invariant under the action of the group H_\mu(X) of measure-preserving homeomorphisms of (X,\mu), and show that any such \sigma-ideal \mathcal I is equal to one of seven \sigma-ideals: \{\emptyset\}, [X]^{\le\omega}, \mathcal E, \mathcal M\cap\mathcal N, \mathcal M, \mathcal N, or [X]^{\le \mathfrak c}. Here [X]^{\le\kappa} is the ideal consisting of subsets of cardiality \le\kappa in X, \mathcal M is the ideal of meager subsets of X, \mathcal N=\{A\subset X:\mu(A)=0\} is the ideal of null subsets of (X,\mu), and \mathcal E is the \sigma-ideal generated by closed null subsets of (X,\mu).
