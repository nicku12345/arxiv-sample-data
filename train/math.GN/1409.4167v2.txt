We prove that each non-metrizable sequential rectifiable space X of countable cs^*-character contains a clopen rectifiable submetrizable k_\omega-subspace H and admits an open disjoint cover by subspaces homeomorphic to clopen subspaces of H. This implies that each sequential rectifiable space with countable cs^*-character either is metrizable or else is a topological sum of submetrizable k_\omega-spaces. Consequently, X is submetrizable and paracompact. This answers a question of Lin and Shen posed in 2011.
