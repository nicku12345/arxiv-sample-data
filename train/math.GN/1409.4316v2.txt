Given a C^2 semi-algebraic mapping F: \mathbb{R}^N \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^p, we consider its restriction to W\hookrightarrow \mathbb{R^{N}} an embedded closed semi-algebraic manifold of dimension n-1\geq p\geq 2 and introduce sufficient conditions for the existence of a fibration structure (generalized open book structure) induced by the projection \frac{F}{\Vert F \Vert}:W\setminus F^{-1}(0)\to S^{p-1}. Moreover, we show that the well known local and global Milnor fibrations, in the real and complex settings, follow as a byproduct by considering W as spheres of small and big radii, respectively. Furthermore, we consider the composition mapping of F with the canonical projection \pi: \mathbb{R}^{p} \to \mathbb{R}^{p-1} and prove that the fibers of \frac{F}{\Vert F \Vert} and \frac{\pi\circ F}{\Vert \pi\circ F \Vert} are homotopy equivalent. We also show several formulae relating the Euler characteristics of the fiber of the projection \frac{F}{\Vert F \Vert} and W\cap F^{-1}(0). Similar formulae are proved for mappings obtained after composition of F with canonical projections.
