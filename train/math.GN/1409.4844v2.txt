The countable uniform power (or uniform box product) of a uniform space X is a special topology on {}^{\omega}X that lies between the Tychonoff topology and the box topology. We solve an open problem posed by P. Nyikos showing that if X is a compact proximal space then the countable uniform power of X is also proximal (although it is not compact). By recent results of J. R. Bell and G. Gruenhage this implies that the countable uniform power of a Corson compactum is collectionwise normal, countably paracompact and Fr\'echet-Urysohn. We also give some results about first countability, realcompactness in countable uniform powers of compact spaces and explore questions by P. Nyikos about semi-proximal spaces.
