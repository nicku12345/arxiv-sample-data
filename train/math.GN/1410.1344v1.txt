We study the closures of subgroups, semilattices and different kinds of semigroup extensions in semitopological inverse semigroups with continuous inversion. In particularly we show that a topological group G is H-closed in the class of semitopological inverse semigroups with continuous inversion if and only if G is compact, a Hausdorff linearly ordered topological semilattice E is H-closed in the class of semitopological semilattices if and only if E is H-closed in the class of topological semilattices, and a topological Brandt \lambda^0-extension of S is (absolutely) H-closed in the class of semitopological inverse semigroups with continuous inversion if and only if so is S. Also, we construct an example of an H-closed non-absolutely H-closed semitopological semilattice in the class of semitopological semilattices.
