This paper deepens into the relations between coarse spaces and compactifications, by defining a C_0 coarse structure attached to a family of pseudometrics. This definition allow us to give a more topological point of view on the relations between coarse structures and compactifications ---like the Higson-Roe compactification, corona and functor and the topological coarse structure attached to a compactification---, define new functors and giving new relations between them, in particular, some equivalences of categories.
