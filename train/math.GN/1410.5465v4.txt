In the seminal monograph "Theory of retracts", Borsuk raised the following question: suppose two compact ANR's are h--equal, i.e. mutually homotopy dominate each other, are they homotopy equivalent? The current paper approaches this question in two ways. On one end, we provide conditions on the fundamental group which guarantee a positive answer to the Borsuk question. On the other end, we construct various examples of compact h--equal, not homotopy equivalent continua, with distinct properties. The first class of these examples has trivial all known algebraic invariants (such as homology, homotopy groups etc.) The second class is given by n--connected continua, for any n, which are infinite CW--complexes, and hence ANR's, on a complement of a point.
