The paper discusses the conditions for the existence of fixed points of multivalued mappings that are not based on the linear structure of the set. The descriptions for the sets of fixed points for mappings with closed graph in compact Hausdorff spaces and in metrizable spaces, as well as for continuous functions in spaces with convergence (Frechet topology) and in spaces with Scott topology are provided. Applications to the problem of the equilibrium are given: the sets of saddle points and of Nash equilibria for compact Hausdorff and metrizable spaces of strategies of players are described.
