We provide a machinery for transferring some properties of metrizable ANR-spaces to metrizable LC^n-spaces. As a result, we show that for complete metrizable spaces the properties ALC^n, LC^n and WLC^n coincide to each other. We also provide the following spectral characterizations of ALC^n and cell-like compacta: A compactum X is ALC^n if and only if X is the limit space of a \sigma-complete inverse system S=\{X_\alpha, p^{\beta}_\alpha, \alpha<\beta<\tau\} consisting of compact metrizable LC^n-spaces X_\alpha such that all bonding projections p^{\beta}_\alpha, as a well all limit projections p_\alpha, are UV^n-maps. A compactum X is a cell-like (resp., UV^n) space if and only if X is the limit space of a \sigma-complete inverse system consisting of cell-like (resp., UV^n) metric compacta.
