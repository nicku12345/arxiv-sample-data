For a topological space X and an ideal \mathscr{H} of subsets of X we introduce the notion of connectedness modulo \mathscr{H}. This notion of connectedness naturally generalizes the notion of connectedness in its usual sense. In the case when X is completely regular, we introduce a subspace \gamma_{\mathscr H} X of the Stone--\v{C}ech compactification \beta X of X, such that connectedness modulo {\mathscr H} is equivalent to connectedness of \beta X\setminus\gamma_{\mathscr H} X. In particular, we prove that when {\mathscr H} is the ideal generated by the collection of all open subspaces of X with pseudocompact closure, then X is connected modulo {\mathscr H} if and only if \mathrm{cl}_{\beta X}(\beta X\setminus\upsilon X) is connected, and when X is normal and {\mathscr H} is the ideal generated by the collection of all closed realcompact subspaces of X, then X is connected modulo {\mathscr H} if and only if \mathrm{cl}_{\beta X}(\upsilon X\setminus X) is connected. Here \upsilon X is the Hewitt realcompactification of X.
