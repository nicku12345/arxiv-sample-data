Let G be a discrete group and let \mathcal A and \mathcal B be two subgroups of G-valued continuous functions defined on two 0-dimensional compact spaces X and Y. A group isomorphism H defined between \mathcal A and \mathcal B is called \textit{separating} when for each pair of maps f,g\in \mathcal A satisfying that f^{-1}(e_G)\cup g^{-1}(e_G)=X, it holds that Hf^{-1}(e_G)\cup Hg^{-1}(e_G)=Y. We prove that under some mild conditions every separating isomorphism H:\mathcal A\longrightarrow \mathcal B can be represented by means of a continuous function h: Y\longrightarrow X as a weighted composition operator. As a consequence we establish the equivalence of two subgroups of continuous functions if there is a biseparating isomorphism defined between them.
