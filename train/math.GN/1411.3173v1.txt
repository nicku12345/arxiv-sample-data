We prove that every continuous function f:E\to Y depends on countably many coordinates, if E is an (\aleph_1,\aleph_0)-invariant pseudo-\aleph_1-compact subspace of a product of topological spaces and Y is a space with a regular G_\delta-diagonal. Using this fact for any \alpha<\omega_1 we construct an (\alpha+1)-embedded subspace of a completely regular space which is not \alpha-embedded.
