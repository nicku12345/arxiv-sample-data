We generalize the concept of the pointwise supremum of real-valued functions to the pointfree setting. The concept itself admits a direct and intuitive formulation which makes no mention of points. But our aim here is to investigate pointwise suprema of subsets of \mathcal{R}L, the family of continuous real valued functions on a locale, or pointfree space. Our setting is the category \mathbf{W} of archimedean lattice-ordered groups (\ell-groups) with designated weak order unit, with morphisms which preserve the group and lattice operations and take units to units.   A main result is the appropriate analog of the Nakano-Stone Theorem: a (completely regular) locale L has the feature that \mathcal{R}L is conditionally pointwise complete (\sigma -complete), i.e., every bounded (countable) family from \mathcal{R}L has a pointwise supremum in \mathcal{R}L, iff L  is boolean (a P-locale).   We adopt a maximally broad definition of unconditional pointwise completeness (\sigma-completeness): a divisible \mathbf{W}-object G is pointwise complete (\sigma-complete) if it contains a pointwise supremum for every subset which has a supremum in any extension. We show that the pointwise complete (\sigma-complete) \mathbf{W}-objects are those of the form \mathcal{R}L for L a boolean locale (P-locale). Finally, we show that a \mathbf{W}-object G is pointwise \sigma-complete iff it is epicomplete.
