Let E,F be two topological spaces and u:E\rightarrow F be a map. \ If F is Haudorff and u is continuous, then its graph is closed. \ \ The Closed Graph Theorem establishes the converse when E and F are suitable objects of topological algebra, and more specifically topological groups, topological vector spaces (TVS's) or locally vector spaces (LCS's) of a special type. The Open Mapping Theorem, also called the Banach-Schauder theorem, states that under suitable conditions on E and F, if  v:F\rightarrow E is a continuous linear surjective map, it is open. \ When the Open Mapping Theorem holds true for v, so does the Closed Graph Theorem for u. \ The converse is also valid in most cases, but there are exceptions. \ This point is clarified. Some of the most important versions of the Closed Graph Theorem and of the Open Mapping Theorem are stated without proof but with the detailed reference.
