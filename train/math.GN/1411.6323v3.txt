Connectedness, path connectedness, and uniform connectedness are well-known concepts. In the traditional presentation of these concepts there is a substantial difference between connectedness and the other two notions, namely connectedness is defined as the absence of disconnectedness, while path connectedness and uniform connectedness are defined in terms of connecting paths and connecting chains, respectively. In compact metric spaces uniform connectedness and connectedness are well-known to coincide, thus the apparent conceptual difference between the two notions disappears. Connectedness in topological spaces can also be defined in terms of chains governed by open coverings in a manner that is more reminiscent of path connectedness. We present a unifying metric formalism for connectedness, which encompasses both connectedness of topological spaces and uniform connectedness of uniform spaces, and which further extends to a hierarchy of notions of connectedness.
