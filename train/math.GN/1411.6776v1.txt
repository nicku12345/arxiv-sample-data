We introduce a numerical scale to quantify to which extent a planar continuum is not locally connected. For a locally connected continuum, the numerical scale is zero; for a continuum like the topologist's sine curve, the scale is one; for an indecomposable continuum, it is infinite. Among others, we shall pose a new problem that may be of some interest: can we estimate the scale from above for the Mandelbrot set \mathcal{M} ?
