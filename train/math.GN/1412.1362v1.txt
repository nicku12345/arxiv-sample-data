In this article, we prove the existence of common fixed points for a pair of maps on a q-spherically complete T_0-ultra-quasi-metric space. The present article is a generalization, in the assymmetric setting of the paper of Rao et al.\cite{Rao}. The key point in the proof is the use of Zorn's lemma. We construct an appropriate chain and show that it has a maximal element, from which we extract the fixed point we are looking for. The choice of the sets, here open balls, is characteristic of this type of problems and the contraction condition are essential, specially when we are to establish the uniqueness of the fixed point
