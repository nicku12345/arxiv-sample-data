The concept of the strong Pytkeev property, recently introduced by Tsaban and Zdomskyy in [32], was successfully applied to the study of the space C_c(X) of all continuous real-valued functions with the compact-open topology on some classes of topological spaces X including \v{C}ech-complete Lindel\"{o}f spaces. Being motivated also by several results providing various concepts of networks we introduce the class of \mathfrak{P}-spaces strictly included in the class of \aleph-spaces. This class of generalized metric spaces is closed under taking subspaces, topological sums and countable products and any space from this class has countable tightness. Every \mathfrak{P}-space X has the strong Pytkeev property. The main result of the present paper states that if X is an \aleph_0-space and Y is a \mathfrak{P}-space, then the function space C_c(X,Y) has the strong Pytkeev property. This implies that for a separable metrizable space X and a metrizable topological group G the space C_c(X,G) is metrizable if and only if it is Fr\'{e}chet-Urysohn. We show that a locally precompact group G is a \mathfrak{P}-space if and only if G is metrizable.
