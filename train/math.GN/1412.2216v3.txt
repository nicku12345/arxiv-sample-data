Denote by \mathbf C_k[\mathfrak M] the C_k-stable closure of the class \mathfrak M of all metrizable spaces, i.e., \mathbf C_k[\mathfrak M] is the smallest class of topological spaces that contains \mathfrak M and is closed under taking subspaces, homeomorphic images, countable topological sums, countable Tychonoff products, and function spaces C_k(X,Y) with Lindel\"of domain. We show that the class \mathbf C_k[\mathfrak M] coincides with the class of all topological spaces homeomorphic to subspaces of the function spaces C_k(X,Y) with a separable metrizable space X and a metrizable space Y. We say that a topological space Z is Ascoli if every compact subset of C_k(Z) is evenly continuous; by the Ascoli Theorem, each k-space is Ascoli. We prove that the class \mathbf C_k[\mathfrak M] properly contains the class of all Ascoli \aleph_0-spaces and is properly contained in the class of \mathfrak P-spaces, recently introduced by Gabriyelyan and K\k{a}kol. Consequently, an Ascoli space Z embeds into the function space C_k(X,Y) for suitable separable metrizable spaces X and Y if and only if Z is an \aleph_0-space.
