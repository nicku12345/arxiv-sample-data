Denote by \mathbf C_p[\mathfrak M_0] the C_p-stable closure of the class \mathfrak M_0 of all separable metrizable spaces, i.e., \mathbf C_p[\mathfrak M_0] is the smallest class of topological spaces that contains \mathfrak M_0 and is closed under taking subspaces, homeomorphic images, countable topological sums, countable Tychonoff products, and function spaces C_p(X,Y). Using a recent deep result of Chernikov and Shelah (2014), we prove that \mathbf C_p[\mathfrak M_0] coincides with the class of all Tychonoff spaces of cardinality strictly less than \beth_{\omega_1}. Being motivated by the theory of Generalized Metric Spaces, we characterize also other natural C_p-type stable closures of the class \mathfrak M_0.
