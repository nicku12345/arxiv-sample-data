In three recaent papers of G. Dimov, many Stone-type duality theorems for the category of locally compact Hausdorff spaces and continuous maps and some of its subcategories were proved. The dual objects in all these theorems are the local contact algebras. In a paper of D. Vakarelov, G. Dimov, I. Duntsch, and B. Bennett, the notion of an MVD-algebra was introduced and it was shown that it is equivalent to the notion of a local contact algebra. In this paper we express the duality theorems mentioned above in a new form using MVD-algebras and appropriate morphisms between them instead of local contact algebras and the respective morphisms.
