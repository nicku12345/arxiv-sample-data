In a compact abelian group X, a characterized subgroup is a subgroup H such that there exists a sequence of characters \vs=(v_n) of X such that H=\{x\in X:v_n(x)\to 0 \text{ in } \T\}. Gabriyelyan proved for X=\T, that \{x\in\T:n!x\to 0 \text{ in }\T\} is not an F_\sigma-set. In this paper, we give a complete description of the F_\sigma-subgroups of \T characterized by sequences of integers \vs=(v_n) such that v_n|v_{n+1} for all n\in\N (we show that these are exactly the countable characterized subgroups). Moreover in the general setting of compact metrizable abelian groups, we give a new point of view to study the Borel complexity of characterized subgroups in terms of appropriate test-topologies in the whole group.
