A topological space X has the strong Pytkeev property at a point x\in X if there exists a countable family \mathcal N of subsets of X such that for each neighborhood O_x\subset X and subset A\subset X accumulating at x, there is a set N\in\mathcal N such that N\subset O_x and N\cap A is infinite. We prove that for any \aleph_0-space X and any space Y with the strong Pytkeev property at a point y\in Y the function space C_k(X,Y) has the strong Pytkeev property at the constant function X\to \{y\}\subset Y. If the space Y is rectifiable, then the function space C_k(X,Y) is rectifiable and has the strong Pytkeev property at each point. We also prove that for any pointed spaces (X_n,*_n), n\in\omega, with the strong Pytkeev property their Tychonoff product and their small box-product both have the strong Pytkeev property at the distinguished point. We prove that a sequential rectifiable space X has the strong Pytkeev property if and only if X is metrizable or contains a clopen submetrizable k_\omega-subspace. A locally precompact topological group is metrizable if and only if it contains a dense subgroup with the strong Pytkeev property.
