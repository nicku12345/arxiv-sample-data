Let G be a Polish (i.e., complete separable metric topological) group. Define G to be an algebraically determined Polish group if for any Polish group L and algebraic isomorphism \varphi: L \mapsto G, we have that \varphi is a topological isomorphism. Let M(n,\R) be the set of n \times n matrices with real coefficients and let the group G in the above definition be the natural semidirect product \R^{n} \rtimes G(n), where n \ge 2 and G(n) is one of the following groups: either the general linear group GL(n,\R) = \left\{ A \in M(n,\R) \ | \ \det(A) \ne 0 \right\}, or the special linear group SL(n,\R) = \left\{ A \in GL(n,\R) \ | \ \det(A) = 1 \right\}, or |SL(n,\R)| = \left\{ A \in GL(n,\R) \ | \ |\det(A)| = 1 \right\} or GL^{+}(n,\R) = \left\{ A \in GL(n,\R) \ | \ \det(A) > 0 \right\}. These groups are of fundamental importance for linear algebra and geometry. The purpose of this paper is to prove that the natural semidirect product \R^{n} \rtimes G(n) is an algebraically determined Polish group. Such a result is not true for \complexes^{n} \rtimes GL(n,\complexes) nor even for \R^{3} \rtimes SO(3,\R). The proof of this result is done in a sequence of steps designed to verify the hypotheses of the road map Theorem 2. A key intermediate result is that \varphi^{-1}(SO(n,\R)) is an analytic subgroup of L for every n \ge 2.
