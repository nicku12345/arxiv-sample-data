Let G be a topological group and A a topological G-module (not necessarily abelian). In this paper, we define H^{0}(G,A) and H^{1}(G,A) and will find a six terms exact cohomology sequence involving H^{0} and H^{1}. We will extend it to a seven terms exact sequence of cohomology up to dimension two. We find a criterion such that vanishing of H^{1}(G,A) implies the connectivity of G. We show that if H^{1}(G,A)=1, then all complements of A in the semidirect product G\ltimes A are conjugate. Also as a result, we prove that if G is a compact Hausdorff group and A is a locally compact almost connected Hausdorff group with the trivial maximal compact subgroup then, H^{1}(G,A)=1.
