We study nonmetric analogues of Vietoris solenoids. Let \Lambda be an ordered continuum, and let \vec{p}=\langle p_1,p_2,\dots\rangle be a sequence of positive integers. We define a natural inverse limit space S(\Lambda,\vec{p}), where the first factor space is the nonmetric "circle" obtained by identifying the endpoints of \Lambda, and the nth factor space, n>1, consists of p_1p_2\cdot\dots \cdot p_{n-1} copies of \Lambda laid end to end in a circle. We prove that for every cardinal \kappa\geq 1, there is an ordered continuum \Lambda such that S(\Lambda,\vec{p}) is \frac{1}{\kappa}-homogeneous; for \kappa>1, \Lambda is built from copies of the long line. Our example with \kappa=2 provides a nonmetric answer to a question of Neumann-Lara, Pellicer-Covarrubias and Puga-Espinosa from 2005, and with \kappa=1 provides an example of a nonmetric homogeneous circle-like indecomposable continuum. Finally, we employ a cohomology argument to prove that for each ordered continuum \Lambda, as \vec{p} varies there are 2^\omega-many nonhomeomorphic spaces S(\Lambda,\vec{p}).
