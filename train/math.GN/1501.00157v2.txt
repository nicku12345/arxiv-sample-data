\mathbb{N}^* = \beta\mathbb{N} \setminus \mathbb{N} has a canonical dynamical structure provided by the shift map, the unique continuous extension to \beta\mathbb{N} of the map n \mapsto n+1 on \mathbb{N}. Here we investigate the question of what dynamical systems can be written as quotients of \mathbb{N}^*. We prove that a dynamical system is a quotient of \mathbb{N}^* if and only if it is isomorphic to the \omega-limit set of some point in some larger system. This provides a full external characterization of the quotients of \mathbb{N}^*. We also prove, assuming MA_{\sigma\text{-centered}}(\kappa), that a dynamical system of weight \kappa is a quotient of \mathbb{N}^* if and only if it is chain transitive. This provides a consistent partial internal characterization of the quotients of \mathbb{N}^*, and a full internal characterization for metrizable systems.
