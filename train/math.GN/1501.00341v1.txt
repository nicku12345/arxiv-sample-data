The aim of this work is to introduce and study some new types of generalizations of pairwise paralindeloff spaces, pairwise nearly paralindeloff and almost paralindeloff spaces. Some of their characterizations, properties and subsets are investigated and studied. Furthermore, the relation of among them with some pairwise separation axioms are considered.
