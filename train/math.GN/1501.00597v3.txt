In this note we show, roughly speaking, that if \mathcal{B} is a Boolean algebra included in the natural way in the collection \mathcal{D}/_\sim of all equivalence classes of natural density sets of the natural numbers, modulo null density, then \mathcal{B} extends to a \sigma-algebra \Sigma \subset \mathcal{D}/_\sim and the natural density is \sigma-additive on \Sigma. We prove the main tool employed in the argument in a more general setting, involving a kind of quantum state function, more precisely, a group-valued submeasure on an orthomodular lattice. At the end we discuss the construction of `non-distributive L^p spaces' by means of submeasures on lattices.
