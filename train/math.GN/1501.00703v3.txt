In fairly elementary terms this paper presents, and expands upon, a recent result by Garner by which the notion of topologicity of a concrete functor is subsumed under the concept of total cocompleteness of enriched category theory. Motivated by some key results of the 1970s, the paper develops all needed ingredients from the theory of quantaloids in order to place essential results of categorical topology into the context of quantaloid-enriched category theory, a field that previously drew its motivation and applications from other domains, such as quantum logic and sheaf theory.
