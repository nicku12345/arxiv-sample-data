Let P be a directed set and X a space. A collection \mathcal{C} of subsets of X is \emph{P-locally finite} if \mathcal{C}=\bigcup \{ \mathcal{C}_p : p \in P\} where (i) if p \le p' then \mathcal{C}_p \subseteq \mathcal{C}_{p'} and (ii) each \mathcal{C}_p is locally finite. Then X is \emph{P-paracompact} if every open cover has a P-locally finite open refinement. Further, X is \emph{P-metrizable} if it has a (P \times \mathbb{N})-locally finite base. This work provides the first detailed study of P-paracompact and P-metrizable spaces, particularly in the case when P is a \mathcal{K}(M), the set of all compact subsets of a separable metrizable space M ordered by set inclusion.
