We investigate Banach space automorphisms T:\ell_\infty/c_0\rightarrow\ell_\infty/c_0  focusing on the possibility of representing their fragments of the form T_{B,A}:\ell_\infty(A)/c_0(A)\rightarrow \ell_\infty(B)/c_0(B) for A, B\subseteq N infinite by means of linear operators from \ell_\infty(A) into \ell_\infty(B), infinite A\times B-matrices, continuous maps from B^*=\beta B\setminus B into A^*, or bijections from B to A. This leads to the analysis of general linear operators on \ell_\infty/c_0. We present many examples, introduce and investigate several classes of operators, for some of them we obtain satisfactory representations and for other give examples showing that it is impossible. In particular, we show that there are automorphisms of \ell_\infty/c_0 which cannot be lifted to operators on \ell_\infty and assuming OCA+MA we show that every automorphism of \ell_\infty/c_0 with no fountains or with no funnels is locally, i.e., for some infinite A, B\subseteq N as above, induced by a bijection from B to A. This additional set-theoretic assumption is necessary as we show that the continuum hypothesis implies the existence of counterexamples of diverse flavours. However, many basic problems, some of which are listed in the last section, remain open.
