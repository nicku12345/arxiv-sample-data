This paper proposes a novel phase identification method for distribution networks where phases can be severely unbalanced and insufficiently labeled. The analysis approach draws on data from high-precision phasor measurement units (micro-synchrophasors or uPMUs) for distribution systems. A key fact is that time-series voltage phasors taken from a distribution network show specific patterns regarding connected phases at measurement points. The algorithm is based on analyzing crosscorrelations over voltage magnitudes along with phase angle differences on two candidate phases to be matched. If two measurement points are on the same phase, large positive voltage magnitude correlations and small voltage angle differences should be observed. The algorithm is initially validated using the IEEE 13-bus model, and subsequently with actual uPMU measurements on a 12-kV feeder.
