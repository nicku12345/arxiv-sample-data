The Jones-Wenzl idempotents are elements of the Temperley-Lieb planar algebra that are important, but complicated to write down. We will present a new planar algebra, the pop-switch planar algebra, which contains the Temperley-Lieb planar algebra. It is motivated by Jones' idea of the graph planar algebra of type A_n. In the tensor category of idempotents of the pop-switch planar algebra, the nth Jones-Wenzl idempotent is isomorphic to a direct sum of n+1 diagrams consisting of only vertical strands.
