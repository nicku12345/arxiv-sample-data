In this paper we consider a notion of \mathcal{I}-Luzin set which generalizes the classical notion of Luzin set and Sierpi{\'n}ski set on Euclidean spaces. We show that there is a translation invariant \sigma-ideal \mathcal{I} with Borel base for which \mathcal{I}-Luzin set can be \mathcal{I}-measurable. If we additionally assume that \mathcal{I} has Smital property (or its weaker version) then \mathcal{I}-Luzin sets are \mathcal{I}-nonmeasurable. We give some constructions of \mathcal{I}-Luzin sets involving additive structure of \mathbb{R}^n. Moreover, we show that if L is a Luzin set and S is a Sierpi{\'n}ski set then the complex sum L+S cannot be a Bernstein set.
