Being motivated by the famous Kaplansky theorem we study various sequential properties of a Banach space E and its closed unit ball B, both endowed with the weak topology of E. We show that B has the Pytkeev property if and only if E in the norm topology contains no isomorphic copy of \ell_1, while E has the Pytkeev property if and only if it is finite-dimensional. We extend Schl\"uchtermann and Wheeler's result by showing that B is a (separable) metrizable space if and only if it has countable cs^\ast-character and is a k-space. As a corollary we obtain that B is Polish if and only if it has countable cs^\ast-character and is \v{C}ech-complete, that supplements a result of Edgar and Wheeler.
