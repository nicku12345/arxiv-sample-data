The main results of this paper are: (1) If a space X can be embedded as a cellular subspace of \mathbb{R}^n then X admits arbitrary fine open coverings whose nerves are homeomorphic to the n-dimensional cube \mathbb{D}^n; (2) Every n-dimensional cell-like compactum can be embedded into (2n+1)-dimensional Euclidean space as a cellular subset; and (3) There exists a locally compact planar set which is acyclic with respect to \v{C}ech homology and whose fine coverings are all nonacyclic.
