In this paper we present a result concerning locally contractive maps defined on subsets of perfect Polish ultrametric spaces (i.e. separable complete ultrametric spaces). Specifically, we show that a perfect compact ultrametric space cannot be contained in its locally contractive image, a corollary relating this result to minimal dynamical systems, and pose a conjecture for the general Polish ultrametric case.
