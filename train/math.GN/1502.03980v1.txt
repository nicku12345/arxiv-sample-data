We introduce a notion of topological entropy for continuous actions of compactly generated topological groups on compact Hausdorff spaces. It is shown that any continuous action of a compactly generated topological group on a compact Hausdorff space with vanishing topological entropy is amenable. Given an arbitrary compactly generated locally compact Hausdorff topological group G, we consider the canonical action of G on the closed unit ball of L^{1}(G)' \cong L^{\infty}(G) endowed with the corresponding weak-^{\ast} topology. We prove that this action has vanishing topological entropy if and only if G is compact. Furthermore, we show that the considered action has infinite topological entropy if G is almost connected and non-compact.
