Let \mathfrak{P} be a topological property. We study the relation between the order structure of the set of all \mathfrak{P}-extensions of a completely regular space X with compact remainder (partially ordered by the standard partial order \leq) and the topology of certain subspaces of the outgrowth \beta X\setminus X. The cases when \mathfrak{P} is either pseudocompactness or realcompactness are studied in more detail.
