In this paper we combine the notions of partial metric spaces with negative distances, G_p-metric spaces and n-metric spaces together into one structure called the partial n-metric spaces. These are generalizations of all the said structures, and also generalize the notions of G-metric and G_p-metric spaces to arbitrary finite dimension. We prove Cauchy mapping theorems and other fixed point theorems for such spaces.
