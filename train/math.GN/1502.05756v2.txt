Within the framework of free actions of compact quantum groups on unital C*-algebras, we propose two conjectures. The first one states that, if H is the C*-algebra of a compact quantum group coacting freely on a unital C*-algebra A, then there is no equivariant *-homomorphism from A to the join C*-algebra A*H. For A being the C*-algebra of continuous functions on a sphere with the antipodal coaction of the C*-algebra of funtions on \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}, we recover the celebrated Borsuk-Ulam theorem. The second conjecture states that there is no equivariant *-homomorphism from H to the join C*-algebra A*H. We show how to prove the conjecture in the special case A=C(SU_q(2))=H, which is tantamount to showing the non-trivializability of Pflaum's quantum instanton fibration built from SU_q(2).
