It is well known that every (real or complex) normed linear space L is isometrically embeddable into C(X) for some compact Hausdorff space X. Here X is the closed unit ball of L^* (the set of all continuous scalar-valued linear mappings on L) endowed with the weak^* topology, which is compact by the Banach-Alaoglu theorem. We prove that the compact Hausdorff space X can indeed be chosen to be the Stone-Cech compactification of L^*\setminus\{0\}, where L^*\setminus\{0\} is endowed with the supremum norm topology.
