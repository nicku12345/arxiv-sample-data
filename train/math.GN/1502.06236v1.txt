The topology of digital images has been studied much in recent years, but no attempt has been made to exhaustively catalog the structure of binary images of small numbers of points. We produce enumerations of several classes of digital images up to isomorphism and decide which among them are homotopy equivalent to one another. Noting some patterns in the results, we make some conjectures about digital images which are irreducible but not rigid.
