The class \mathfrak C  relative to countably compact topological spaces and the class \mathfrak P relative to pseudocompact spaces introduced by Z. Frol\'ik are naturally generalized relative to every topological property. We provide a characterization of such generalized Frol\'ik classes in the broad case of properties defined in terms of filter convergence.   If a class of spaces can be defined in terms of filter convergence, then the same is true for its Frol\'ik class.
