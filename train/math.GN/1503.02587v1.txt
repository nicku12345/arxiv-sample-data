This article introduces the {\it strongly hit and far-miss as well as hit and strongly far miss hypertopologies on \textrm{CL}(X) associated with} {\mathscr{B}}, a nonempty family of subsets on the topological space X. They result from the strong farness and strong nearness proximities. The main results in this paper stem from the Hausdorffness of (\textrm{CL}(X), \tau_{\doublevee, \mathscr{B}}) and (\textrm{RCL}(X), \tau^\doublewedge_\mathscr{B} ) , where \textrm{RCL}(X) is the space of regular closed subsets of X. To obtain the results, special local families are introduced.
