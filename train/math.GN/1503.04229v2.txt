We give an example of an infinite metrizable space X such that the space C_p(X), of continuous real-valued function on X endowed with the pointwise topology, is not homeomorphic to its own square C_p(X)\times C_p(X). The space X is a zero-dimensional subspace of the real line. Our result answers a long-standing open question in the theory of function spaces posed by A.V. Arhangel'skii.
