For any topological space X we study the relation between the universal uniformity \mathcal U_X, the universal quasi-uniformity q\mathcal U_X and the universal pre-uniformity p\mathcal U_X on X. For a pre-uniformity \mathcal U on a set X and a word v in the two-letter alphabet \{+,-\} we define the verbal power \mathcal U^v of \mathcal U and study its boundedness numbers \ell(\mathcal U^v) and \bar \ell(\mathcal U^v). The boundedness numbers of the (Boolean operations over) the verbal powers of the canonical pre-uniformities p\mathcal U_X, q\mathcal U_X and \mathcal U_X yield new cardinal characteristics \ell^v(X), \bar \ell^v(X), q\ell^v(X), q\bar \ell^v(X), u\ell(X) of a topological space X, which generalize all known cardinal topological invariants related to (star)-covering properties. We study the relation of the new cardinal invariants \ell^v, \bar \ell^v to classical cardinal topological invariants such as Lindel\"of number \ell, density d, and spread s. The simplest new verbal cardinal invariant is the foredensity \ell^-(X) defined for a topological space X as the smallest cardinal \kappa such that for any neighborhood assignment (O_x)_{x\in X} there is a subset A\subset X of cardinality |A|\le\kappa that meets each neighborhood O_x, x\in X. It is clear that \ell^-(X)\le d(X)\le \ell^-(X)\cdot \chi(X). We shall prove that \ell^-(X)=d(X) if |X|<\aleph_\omega. On the other hand, for every singular cardinal \kappa (with \kappa\le 2^{2^{cf(\kappa)}}) we construct a (totally disconnected) T_1-space X such that \ell^-(X)=cf(\kappa)<\kappa=|X|=d(X).
