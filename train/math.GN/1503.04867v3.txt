Continuous interpolation of real-valued data is characterized by piecewise monotone functions on a compact metric space. Topological total variation of piecewise monotone function f:X->R is a homeomorphism-invariant generalization of 1D total variation. A varilet basis is a collection of piecewise monotone functions { g_i |i = 1...n}, called varilets, such that every linear combination \sum a_ig_i has topological total variation \sum |a_i|. A varilet transform for f is a varilet basis for which f =\sum \alpha_ig_i. Filtered versions of f result from altering the coefficients \alpha_i.
