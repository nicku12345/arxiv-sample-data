The ultrafilters on the partial order ([\omega]^{\omega},\subseteq^*) are the free ultrafilters on \omega, which constitute the space \omega^*, the Stone-Cech remainder of \omega. If U is an upperset of this partial order (i.e., a semifilter), then the ultrafilters on U correspond to closed subsets of \omega^* via Stone duality.   If, in addition, U is sufficiently "simple" (more precisely, G_\delta as a subset of 2^\omega), we show that U is similar to [\omega]^{\omega} in several ways. First, \mathfrak{p}_U = \mathfrak{t}_U = \mathfrak{p} (this extends a result of Malliaris and Shelah). Second, if \mathfrak{d} = \mathfrak{c} then there are ultrafilters on U that are also P-filters (this extends a result of Ketonen). Third, there are ultrafilters on U that are weak P-filters (this extends a result of Kunen).   By choosing appropriate U, these similarity theorems find applications in dynamics, algebra, and combinatorics. Most notably, we will prove that (\omega^*,+) contains minimal left ideals that are also weak P-sets.
