We present a fixed point theorem on topological cylinders in normed linear spaces for maps satisfying a property of stretching a space along paths. This result is a generalization of a similar theorem obtained by D. Papini and F. Zanolin. In view of the main result we discuss the existence of fixed points for maps defined on different types of domains and we propose alternative proofs for classical fixed point theorems, as Brouwer, Schauder and Krasnosel'ski\u{\i} ones.
