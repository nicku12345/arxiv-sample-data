In this paper, two open questions on strong b-metric spaces posed by Kirk and Shahzad [11, Chapter 12] are investigated. A counter-example is constructed to give a negative answer to the first question, and a theorem on the completion of a strong b-metric space is proved to give a positive answer to the second question.
