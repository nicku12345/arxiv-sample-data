In this paper we discuss what kind of constrains combinatorial covering properties of Menger, Scheepers, and Hurewicz impose on remainders of topological groups. For instance, we show that such a remainder is Hurewicz if and only it is \sigma-compact. Also, the existence of a Scheepers non-\sigma-compact remainder of a topological group follows from CH and yields a P-point, and hence is independent of ZFC. We also make an attempt to prove a dichotomy for the Menger property of remainders of topological groups in the style of Arhangel'skii.
