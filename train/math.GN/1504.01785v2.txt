For a Urysohn space X we define the regular diagonal degree \overline{\Delta}(X) of X to be the minimal infinite cardinal \kappa such that X has a regular G_\kappa-diagonal i.e. there is a family (U_\eta:\eta<\kappa) of open neighborhoods of \Delta_X=\{(x,x)\in X^2:x\in X\} in X^2 such that \Delta_X = \bigcap_{\eta<\kappa} \overline{U}_\eta.   In this paper we show that if X is a Urysohn space then: (1) |X|\leq 2^{c(X)\cdot\overline{\Delta}(X)}; (2) |X|\leq 2^{\overline{\Delta}(X)\cdot 2^{wL(X)}}; (3) |X|\le wL(X)^{\overline{\Delta}(X)\cdot\chi(X)}; and (4) |X|\le aL(X)^{\overline{\Delta}(X)}; where \chi(X), c(X), wL(X) and aL(X) are respectively the character, the cellularity, the weak Lindel\"of number and the almost Lindel\"of number of X.   The first inequality extends to the uncountable case Buzyakova's result that the cardinality of a ccc-space with a regular G_\delta-diagonal does not exceed 2^\omega. It follows from (2) that every weakly Lindel\"of space with a regular G_\delta-diagonal has cardinality at most 2^{2^\omega}.   Inequality (3) implies that when X is a space with a regular G_\delta-diagonal then |X|\le wL(X)^{\chi(X)}. This improves significantly Bell, Ginsburg and Woods inequality |X|\le 2^{\chi(X)wL(X)} for the class of normal spaces with regular G_\delta-diagonals. In particular (3) shows that the cardinality of every first countable space with a regular G_\delta-diagonal does not exceed wL(X)^\omega.   For the class of spaces with regular G_\delta-diagonals (4) improves Bella and Cammaroto inequality |X|\le 2^{\chi(X)\cdot aL(X)}, which is valid for all Urysohn spaces. Also, it follows from (4) that the cardinality of every space with a regular G_\delta-diagonal does not exceed aL(X)^\omega.
