A non-empty subset A of a topological space X is called \emph{finitely non-Hausdorff} if for every non-empty finite subset F of A and every family \{U_x:x\in F\} of open neighborhoods U_x of x\in F, \cap\{U_x:x\in F\}\ne\emptyset and \emph{the non-Hausdorff number nh(X) of X} is defined as follows: nh(X):=1+\sup\{|A|:A\subset X is finitely non-Hausdorff\}. Clearly, if X is a Hausdorff space then nh(X)=2.   We define the \emph{non-Urysohn number of X with respect to the singletons}, nu_s(X), as follows: nu_s(X):=1+\sup\{\mathrm{cl}_\theta(\{x\}):x\in X\}.   In 1967 Hajnal and Juh\'asz proved that if X is a Hausdorff space then: (1) |X|\le 2^{c(X)\chi(X)}; and (2) |X|\le 2^{2^{s(X)}}; where c(X) is the cellularity, \chi(X) is the character and s(X) is the spread of X.   In this paper we generalize (1) by showing that if X is a topological space then |X|\le nh(X)^{c(X)\chi(X)}. Immediate corollary of this result is that (1) holds true for every space X for which nh(X)\le 2^\omega (and even for spaces with nh(X)\le 2^{c(X)\chi(X)}). This gives an affirmative answer to a question posed by M. Bonanzinga in 2013. A simple example of a T_1, first countable, ccc-space X is given such that |X|>2^\omega and |X|=nh(X)^\omega=nh(X). This example shows that the upper bound in our inequality is exact and that nh(X) cannot be omitted (in particular, nh(X) cannot always be replaced by 2 even for T_1-spaces).   In this paper we also generalize (2) by showing that if X is a T_1-space then |X|\le 2^{nu_s(X)\cdot 2^{s(X)}}. It follows from our result that (2) is true for every T_1-space for which nu_s(X)\le 2^{s(X)}. A simple example shows that the presence of the cardinal function nu_s(X) in our inequality is essential.
