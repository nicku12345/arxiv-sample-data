Following [3] we say that a Tychonoff space X is an Ascoli space if every compact subset \mathcal{K} of C_k(X) is evenly continuous; this notion is closely related to the classical Ascoli theorem. Every k_\mathbb{R}-space, hence any k-space, is Ascoli.   Let X be a metrizable space. We prove that the space C_{k}(X) is Ascoli iff C_{k}(X) is a k_\mathbb{R}-space iff X is locally compact. Moreover, C_{k}(X) endowed with the weak topology is Ascoli iff X is countable and discrete.   Using some basic concepts from probability theory and measure-theoretic properties of \ell_1, we show that the following assertions are equivalent for a Banach space E: (i) E does not contain isomorphic copy of \ell_1, (ii) every real-valued sequentially continuous map on the unit ball B_{w} with the weak topology is continuous, (iii) B_{w} is a k_\mathbb{R}-space, (iv) B_{w} is an Ascoli space.   We prove also that a Fr\'{e}chet lcs F does not contain isomorphic copy of \ell_1 iff each closed and convex bounded subset of F is Ascoli in the weak topology. However we show that a Banach space E in the weak topology is Ascoli iff E is finite-dimensional. We supplement the last result by showing that a Fr\'{e}chet lcs F which is a quojection is Ascoli in the weak topology iff either F is finite dimensional or F is isomorphic to the product \mathbb{K}^{\mathbb{N}}, where \mathbb{K}\in\{\mathbb{R},\mathbb{C}\}.
