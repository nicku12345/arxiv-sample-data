For a compact space K we denote by C_w(K) (C_p(K)) the space of continuous real-valued functions on K endowed with the weak (pointwise) topology. In this paper we address the following basic question which seems to be open: Suppose that K is an infinite (metrizable) compact space. Is it true that C_w(K) and C_p(K) are homeomorphic? We show that the answer is "no", provided K is an infinite compact metrizable C-space. In particular our proof works for any infinite compact metrizable finite-dimemsional space K.
