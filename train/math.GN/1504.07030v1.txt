The derivation constant K(A)\geq \frac{1}{2} has been extensively studied for \emph{unital} non-commutative C^*-algebras. In this paper, we investigate properties of K(M(A)) where M(A) is the multiplier algebra of a non-unital C^*-algebra A. A number of general results are obtained which are then applied to the group C^*-algebras A=C^*(G_N) where G_N is the motion group \R^N\rtimes SO(N). Utilising the rich topological structure of the unitary dual \widehat{G_N}, it is shown that, for N\geq3, K(M(C^*(G_N)))= \frac{1}{2}\left\lceil \frac{N}{2}\right\rceil.
