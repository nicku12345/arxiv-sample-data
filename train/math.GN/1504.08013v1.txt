We conservatively extend classical elementary differential calculus to the Cartesian closed category of convergence spaces. By specializing results about the convergence space representation of directed graphs, we use Cayley graphs to obtain a differential calculus on groups, from which we then extract a Boolean differential calculus, in which both linearity and the product rule, also called the Leibniz identity, are satisfied.
