If S is a discrete semigroup, then \beta S has a natural, left-topological semigroup structure extending S. Under some very mild conditions, U(S), the set of uniform ultrafilters on S, is a two-sided ideal of \beta S, and therefore contains all of its minimal left ideals and minimal idempotents. We find some very general conditions under which U(S) contains prime minimal left ideals and left-maximal idempotents.   If S is countable, then U(S) = S^*, and a special case of our main theorem is that if a countable discrete semigroup S is a weakly cancellative and left-cancellative, then S^* contains prime minimal left ideals and left-maximal idempotents. We will provide examples of weakly cancellative semigroups where these conclusions fail, thus showing that this result is sharp.
