The prime purpose of this paper is to define the connectivity structure , on a set E, of any multiple relation defined on a family of sets indexed by E, such a relation expressing compatibility between the states of different systems (thus a full compatibility indicates absence of any connection). We then demonstrate a "Brunn's theorem" for those multiple relations, that is the fact that every connectivity structure is the connectivity structure of such a relation.
