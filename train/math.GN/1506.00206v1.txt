The pinning down number  {pd}(X) of a topological space X is the smallest cardinal \kappa such that for any neighborhood assignment U:X\to \tau_X there is a set A\in [X]^\kappa with A\cap U(x)\ne\emptyset for all x\in X. Clearly, c(X) \le {pd}(X) \le {d}(X).   Here we prove that the following statements are equivalent:   (1) 2^\kappa<\kappa^{+\omega} for each cardinal \kappa;   (2) {d}(X)={pd}(X) for each Hausdorff space X;   (3) {d}(X)={pd}(X) for each 0-dimensional Hausdorff space X.   This answers two questions of Banakh and Ravsky.   The dispersion character \Delta(X) of a space X is the smallest cardinality of a non-empty open subset of X. We also show that if {pd}(X)<{d}(X) then X has an open subspace Y with {pd}(Y)<{d}(Y) and |Y| = \Delta(Y), moreover the following three statements are equiconsistent:   (i) There is a singular cardinal \lambda with pp(\lambda)>\lambda^+, i.e. Shelah's Strong Hypothesis fails;   (ii) there is a 0-dimensional Hausdorff space X such that |X|=\Delta(X) is a regular cardinal and {pd}(X)<{d}(X);   (iii) there is a topological space X such that |X|=\Delta(X) is a regular cardinal and {pd}(X)<{d}(X).   We also prove that   \bullet {d}(X)={pd}(X) for any locally compact Hausdorff space X;   \bullet for every Hausdorff space X we have |X|\le 2^{2^{{pd}(X)}} and {pd}(X)<{d}(X) implies \Delta(X)< 2^{2^{{pd}(X)}};   \bullet for every regular space X we have \min\{\Delta(X),\, w(X)\}\le 2^{{pd}(X)}\, and {d}(X)<2^{{pd}(X)},\, moreover {pd}(X)<{d}(X) implies \,\Delta(X)< {2^{{pd}(X)}}.
