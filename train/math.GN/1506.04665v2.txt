We prove that, under CH, any space with a regular G_\delta-diagonal and caliber \omega_1 is separable; a corollary of this result answers, under CH, a question of Buzyakova. For any Urysohn space X, we establish the inequality |X|\le wL(X)^{s\Delta_2(X)\cdot{dot(X)}} which represents a generalization of a theorem of Basile, Bella, and Ridderbos. We also show that if X is a Hausdorff space, then |X|\le(\pi\chi(X)\cdot d(X))^{ot(X)\cdot\psi_c(X)}; this result implies \v{S}apirovski{\u\i}'s inequality |X|\le\pi\chi(X)^{c(X)\cdot\psi(X)} which only holds for regular spaces. It is also proved that |X|\le \pi\chi(X)^{ot(X)\cdot\psi_c(X)\cdot aL_c(X)} for any Hausdorff space X; this gives one more generalization of the famous Arhangel^\primeskii's inequality |X|\le 2^{\chi(X)\cdot L(X)}.
