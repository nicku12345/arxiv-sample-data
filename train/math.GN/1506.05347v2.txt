In 1988, Mayer proved the remarkable fact that infinity is an explosion point for the set of endpoints of the Julia set of an exponential map that has an attracting fixed point. That is, the set is totally separated (in particular, it does not have any nontrivial connected subsets), but its union with the point at infinity is connected. Answering a question of Schleicher, we extend this result to the set of "escaping endpoints" in the sense of Schleicher and Zimmer, for any exponential map for which the singular value belongs to an attracting or parabolic basin, has a finite orbit, or escapes to infinity under iteration (as well as many other classes of parameters).   Furthermore, we extend one direction of the theorem to much greater generality, by proving that the set of escaping endpoints joined with infinity is connected for any transcendental entire function of finite order with bounded singular set. We also discuss corresponding results for *all* endpoints in the case of exponential maps; in order to do so, we establish a version of Thurston's "no wandering triangles" theorem.
