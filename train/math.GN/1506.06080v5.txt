In this note we study the open-point topological games in order to analyze the least upper bound for density of dense subsets of a topological space. This way we may also analyze the behavior of such cardinal invariants in taking products of spaces. Various related cardinal equalities and inequalities are given. As an application we take a look at Banach spaces with the property (CSP) which can be formulated by stating that each weak-star dense linear subspace of the dual is weak-star separable.
