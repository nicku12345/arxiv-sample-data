Let X be a zero-dimensional space and C_c(X) be the set of all continuous real valued functions on X with countable image. In this article we denote by C_c^K(X) (resp., C_{c}^{\psi}(X)) the set of all functions in C_c(X) with compact (resp., pseudocompact) support. First, we observe that C_c^{K}(X)=O_c^{\beta_0X\setminus X} (resp., C_c^{\psi}(X)=M_c^{\beta_0X\setminus \upsilon_0X}). This implies that for an \Bbb{N}-compact space X, the intersection of all free maximal ideals in C_c(X) equals to C_c^K(X), i.e., M_c^{\beta_0X\setminus X}=C_c^K(X). Afterwards, by applying methods of functionally countable subalgebras, we observe some results in the remainder of Banaschewski compactification. It is shown that for a zero-dimensional non pseudocompact space X, the set \beta_0X\setminus \upsilon_0X has cardinality at least 2^{2^{\aleph_0}}. Moreover, for a locally compact and \Bbb{N}-compact space X, the remainder \beta_0X\setminus X is an almost P-space. These results leads us to find a class of Parovi\breve{\mbox{c}}enko spaces in Banaschewski compactification os a non pseudocompact zero-dimensional space. We conclude with a theorem which gives a lower bound for the cellularity of subspaces \beta_0X\setminus \upsilon_0X and \beta_0X\setminus X, whenever X is a zero-dimensional, locally compact space which is not pseudocompact.
