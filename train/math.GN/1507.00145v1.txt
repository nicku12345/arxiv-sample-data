For a discrete group G and a discrete G-space X, we identify the Stone-\v{C}ech compactifications \beta G and \beta X with the sets of all ultrafilters on G and X, and apply the natural action of \beta G on \beta X to characterize large, thick, thin, sparse and scattered subsets of X. We use G-invariant partitions and colorings to define G-selective and G-Ramsey ultrafilters on X. We show that, in contrast to the set-theoretical case, these two classes of ultrafilters are distinct. We consider also universally thin ultrafilters on \omega, the T-points, and study interrelations between these ultrafilters and some classical ultrafilters on \omega.
