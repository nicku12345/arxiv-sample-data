Given a Tychonoff space X, let F(X) and A(X) be respectively the free topological group and the free Abelian topological group over X in the sense of Markov. For every n\in\mathbb{N}, let F_{n}(X) (resp. A_n(X)) denote the subspace of F(X) (resp. A(X)) that consists of words of reduced length at most n with respect to the free basis X. In this paper, we discuss two weak forms of countability axioms in F(X) or A(X), namely the csf-countability and snf-countability. We provide some characterizations of the csf-countability and snf-countability of F(X) and A(X) for various classes of spaces X. In addition, we also study the csf-countability and snf-countability of F_n(X) or A_n(X), for n=2, 3, 4. Some results of Arhangel'ski\v\i\ in \cite{A1980} and Yamada in \cite{Y1998} are generalized. An affirmative answer to an open question posed by Li et al. in \cite{LLL} is provided.
