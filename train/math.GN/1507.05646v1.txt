Let FP(X) be the free paratopological group over a topological space X. For each non-negative integer n\in\mathbb{N}, denote by FP_{n}(X) the subset of FP(X) consisting of all words of reduced length at most n, and i_{n} by the natural mapping from (X\bigoplus X^{-1}\bigoplus\{e\})^{n} to FP_{n}(X). In this paper, we mainly improve some results of A.S. Elfard and P. Nickolas's [On the topology of free paratopological groups. II, Topology Appl., 160(2013), 220--229.]. The main result is that the natural mapping i_{2}: (X\bigoplus X_{d}^{-1}\bigoplus\{e\})^{2}\longrightarrow FP_{2}(X) is a closed mapping if and only if every neighborhood U of the diagonal \Delta_{1} in X_{d}\times X is a member of the finest quasi-uniformity on X, where X is a T_{1}-space and X_{d} denotes X when equipped with the discrete topology in place of its given topology.
