We first show that, for a fixed locally compact manifold N, the space L^2(S^1,N) has not the homotopy type odf the classical loop space C^\infty(S^1,N), by two theorems:   - the inclusion C^\infty(S^1,N) \subset L^2(S^1,N) is null homotopic if N  is connected,   - the space L^2(S^1,N) is contractible if N is compact and connected.   After this first remark, we show that the spaces H^s(S^1,N) carry a natural structure of Fr\"olicher space, equipped with a Riemannian metric, which motivates the definition of Riemannian Fr\"olicher space.
