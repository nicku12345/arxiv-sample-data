We introduce a modified closing-off argument that results in several improved bounds for the cardinalities of Hausdorff and Urysohn spaces. These bounds involve the cardinal invariant skL(X,\lambda), the skew-\lambda Lindel\"of degree of a space X, where \lambda is a cardinal. skL(X,\lambda) is a weakening of the Lindel\"of degree and is defined as the least cardinal \kappa such that if \mathcal{U} is an open cover of X then there exists \mathcal{V}\in [\mathcal{U}]^{\leq\kappa} such that |X\backslash\cup\mathcal{V}|<\lambda. We show that if X is Hausdorff then |X|\leq 2^{skL(X,\lambda)t(X)\psi(X)}, where \lambda= 2^{t(X)\psi(X)}. This improves the well-known Arhangel'skii- \v{S}apirovskii bound 2^{L(X)t(X)\psi(X)} for the cardinality of a Hausdorff space X. We additionally define several variations of skL(X,\lambda), establish other related cardinality bounds, and provide examples.
