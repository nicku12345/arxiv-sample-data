Let G be a topological group, let \phi be a continuous endomorphism of G and let H be a closed \phi-invariant subgroup of G. We study whether the topological entropy is an additive invariant, that is, h_{top}(\phi)=h_{top}(\phi\restriction_H)+h_{top}(\bar\phi)\,, where \bar\phi:G/H\to G/H is the map induced by \phi. We concentrate on the case when G is locally compact totally disconnected and H is either compact or normal. Under these hypotheses, we show that the above additivity property holds true whenever \phi H=H and \ker(\phi)\leq H. As an application we give a dynamical interpretation of the scale s(\phi), by showing that \log s(\phi) is the topological entropy of a suitable map induced by \phi. Finally, we give necessary and sufficient conditions for the equality \log s(\phi)=h_{top}(\phi) to hold.
