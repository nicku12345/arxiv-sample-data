We investigate strongly separately continuous functions on a product of topological spaces and prove that if X is a countable product of real lines, then there exists a strongly separately continuous function f:X\to\mathbb R which is not Baire measurable. We show that if X is a product of normed spaces X_n, a\in X and \sigma(a)=\{x\in X:|\{n\in\mathbb N: x_n\ne a_n\}|<\aleph_0\} is a subspace of X, equipped with the Tychonoff topology, then for any open set G\subseteq \sigma(a) there is a strongly separately continuous function f:\sigma(a)\to \mathbb R such that the discontinuity point set of f is equal to~G.
