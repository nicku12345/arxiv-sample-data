It is introduced a certain approach for equipment of an arbitrary set of the cardinality of the continuum by structures of Polish groups and two-sided (left or right) invariant Haar measures. By using this approach we answer positively Maleki's certain question(2012) {\it what are the real k-dimensional manifolds with at least two different Lie group structures that have the same Haar measure.} It is demonstrated that for each diffused Borel probability measure \mu defined in a Polish space (G,\rho,\mathcal{B}_{\rho}(G)) without isolated points there exist a metric \rho_1 and a group operation \odot in G such that \mathcal{B}_{\rho}(G)=\mathcal{B}_{\rho_1}(G) and (G,\rho_1, \mathcal{B}_{\rho_1}(G), \odot) stands a compact Polish group with a two-sided (left or right) invariant Haar measure \mu, where \mathcal{B}_{\rho}(G) and \mathcal{B}_{\rho_1}(G) denote Borel \sigma algebras of subsets of G generated by metrics \rho and \rho_1, respectively. Similar result is obtained for construction of locally compact non-compact or non-locally compact Polish groups equipped with two-sided (left or right) invariant quasi-finite Borel measures.
