We prove that every C^*-embedded subset of \ss is a hereditarily Baire subspace of \mathbb R^2.   We also show that for a subspace E\subseteq\{(x,-x):x\in\mathbb R\} of the Sorgenfrey plane \mathbb S^2 the following conditions are equivalent: (i) E is C-embedded in \mathbb S^2; (ii) E is C^*-embedded in \mathbb S^2; (iii) E is a countable G_\delta-subspace of \mathbb R^2 and (iv) E is a countable functionally closed subspace of \mathbb S^2.
