Let X be a metrizable space and {\rm Comp}(X) be the hyperspace consisting of non-empty compact subsets of X endowed with the Vietoris topology. In this paper, we give a necessary and sufficient condition on X for {\rm Comp}(X) to be homeomorphic to a non-separable Hilbert space. Moreover, we consider the topological structure of pair ({\rm Comp}(\overline{X}),{\rm Fin}(X)) of hyperspaces of X and its completion \overline{X}, where {\rm Fin}(X) is the hyperspace of non-empty finite sets in X.
