It is shown that if a T_2 topological space X contains a closed uncountable discrete subspace, then the spaces (\omega_1 + 1)^{\omega} and (\omega_1 + 1)^{\omega_1} embed into (CL(X),\tau_F), the hyperspace of nonempty closed subsets of X equipped with the Fell topology. If (X,d) is a non-separable perfect topological space, then (\omega_1 + 1)^{\omega} and (\omega_1 + 1)^{\omega_1} embed into (CL(X),\tau_{w(d)}), the hyperspace of nonempty closed subsets of X equipped with the Wijsman topology, giving a partial answer to the Question 3.4 in [CJ].
