Generalizing the famous 14-set closure-complement Theorem of Kuratowski from 1922, we prove that for a set X endowed with n pairwise comparable topologies \tau_1\subset\dots\subset\tau_n, by repeated application of the operations of complement and closure in the topologies \tau_1,\dots,\tau_n to a subset A\subset X we can obtains at most 2K(n)=2\sum_{i,j=0}^n\binom{i+j}{i}\binom{i+j}{j} distinct sets.
