Concept of bi-soft topological spaces is introduced. Several notions of a soft topological space are generalized to study bi-soft topological spaces. Separation axioms play a vital role in study of topological spaces. These concepts have been studied in context of bi-soft topological spaces. There is a very close relationship between topology and rough set theory. An application of bi-soft topology is given in rough set theory.
