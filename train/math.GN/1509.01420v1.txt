All spaces are assumed to be infinite Hausdorff spaces. We call a space "anti-Urysohn" (AU in short) iff any two non-emty regular closed sets in it intersect. We prove that   \bullet for every infinite cardinal {\kappa} there is a space of size {\kappa} in which fewer than cf({\kappa}) many non-empty regular closed sets always intersect;   \bullet there is a locally countable AU space of size \kappa iff \omega \le \kappa \le 2^{\mathfrak c}.   A space with at least two non-isolated points is called "strongly anti-Urysohn" (SAU in short) iff any two infinite closed sets in it intersect. We prove that   \bullet if X is any SAU space then  \mathfrak s\le |X|\le 2^{2^{\mathfrak c}};   \bullet if \mathfrak r=\mathfrak c then there is a separable, crowded, locally countable, SAU space of cardinality \mathfrak c; \item if \lambda > \omega Cohen reals are added to any ground model then in the extension there are SAU spaces of size \kappa for all \kappa \in [\omega_1,\lambda];   \bullet if GCH holds and \kappa \le\lambda are uncountable regular cardinals then in some CCC generic extension we have \mathfrak s={\kappa}, \,\mathfrak c={\lambda}, and for every cardinal {\mu}\in [\mathfrak s, \mathfrak c] there is an SAU space of cardinality {\mu}.   The questions if SAU spaces exist in ZFC or if SAU spaces of cardinality > \mathfrak c can exist remain open.
