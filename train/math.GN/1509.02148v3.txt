We prove that a Hausdorff locally compact semitopological bicyclic semigroup with adjoined zero \mathscr{C}^0 is either compact or discrete. Also we show that the similar statement holds for a locally compact semitopological bicyclic semigroup with an adjoined compact ideal and construct an example which witnesses that a counterpart of the statements does not hold when \mathscr{C}^0 is a \v{C}ech-complete metrizable topological inverse semigroup.
