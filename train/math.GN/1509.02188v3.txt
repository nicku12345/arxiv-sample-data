We study a topological generalization of ideal co-maximality in topological rings and present some of its properties, including a generalization of the Chinese remainder theorem. Using the hyperspace uniformity, we prove a stronger version of this theorem concerning infinitely many ideals in supercomplete, pseudo-valuated rings. Finally we prove two interpolation theorems.
