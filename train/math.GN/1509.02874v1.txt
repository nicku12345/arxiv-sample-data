We show that if Y is a dense subspace of a Tychonoff space X, then w(X)\leq nw(Y)^{Nag(Y)}, where Nag(Y) is the Nagami number of Y. In particular, if Y is a Lindel\"of \Sigma-space, then w(X)\leq nw(Y)^\omega\leq nw(X)^\omega.   Better upper bounds for the weight of topological groups are given. For example, if a topological group H contains a dense subgroup G such that G is a Lindel\"of \Sigma-space, then w(H)=w(G)\leq \psi(G)^\omega. Further, if a Lindel\"of \Sigma-space X generates a dense subgroup of a topological group H, then w(H)\leq 2^{\psi(X)}.   Several facts about subspaces of Hausdorff separable spaces are established. It is well known that the weight of a separable Hausdorff space X can be as big as 2^{2^{\mathfrak c}}, where {\mathfrak c}=2^\omega. We prove on the one hand that if a regular Lindel\"of \Sigma-space Y is a subspace of a separable Hausdorff space, then w(Y)\leq \mathfrak c, and the same conclusion holds for a Lindel\"of P-space Y. On the other hand, we present an example of a countably compact topological group G which is homeomorphic to a subspace of a separable Hausdorff space and satisfies w(G)=2^{2^{\mathfrak c}}, i.e. has the maximal possible weight.
