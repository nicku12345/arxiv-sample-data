We study expansive dynamical systems from the viewpoint of general topology. We introduce the notions of orbit and refinement expansivity on topological spaces extending expansivity in the compact metric setting. Examples are given on non-Hausdorff compact spaces. Topological properties are studied in relation to separability axioms, metrizability and uniform expansivity.
