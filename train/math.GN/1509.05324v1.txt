A compact space is said to be weakly Radon-Nikod\'ym if it is homeomorphic to a weak*-compact subset of the dual of a Banach space not containing an isomorphic copy of \ell_1. In this work we provide an example of a continuous image of a Radon-Nikod\'ym compact space which is not weakly Radon-Nikod\'ym. Moreover, we define a superclass of the continuous images of weakly Radon-Nikod\'ym compact spaces and study its relation with Corson compacta and weakly Radon-Nikod\'ym compacta.
