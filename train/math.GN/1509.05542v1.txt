For separable metrizable spaces X,Y and a metrizable topological group Z by S(X\times Y,Z) we denote the space of all separately continuous functions f:X\times Y\to Z endowed with the topology of layer-wise uniform convergence, generated by the subbase consisting of the sets [K_X\times K_Y,U]=\{f\in S(X\times Y,Z):f(K_X\times K_Y)\subset U\}, where U is an open subset of Z and K_X\subset X, K_Y\subset Y are compact sets one of which is a singleton. We prove that every separately continuous function f:X\times Y\to Z with zero-dimensional image f(X\times Y) is a limit of a sequence of jointly continuous functions in the topology of layer-wise uniform convergence.
