This paper is part of a program to understand topologies on spaces of valuations. We fix an ordered abelian group \Gamma and an integral domain R. We study the relation between a topology on \Gamma_\infty and the induced topology on the set \mathcal W_\Gamma of all valuations of R taking values in \Gamma_\infty. For instance, we give a criterion for  \mathcal W_\Gamma to be closed in \left(\Gamma_\infty\right)^R. We also discuss the effect of this criterion for natural topologies on \Gamma_\infty.
