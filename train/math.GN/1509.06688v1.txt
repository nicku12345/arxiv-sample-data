In this paper we consider all orientation-preserving \mathbb{Z}_{4}-actions on 3-dimensional handlebodies V_g of genus g>0. We study the graph of groups (\Gamma(v),\mathbf{G(v)}), which determines a handlebody orbifold V(\Gamma(v),{\mathbf{G(v)}})\simeq{V_g}/\mathbb{Z}_{4}. This algebraic characterization is used to enumerate the total number of \mathbb{Z}_{4} group actions on such handlebodies, up to equivalence.
