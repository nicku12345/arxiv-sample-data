The deck of a topological space X is the set \mathcal{D}(X)=\{[X \setminus \{x\}] \colon x \in X\}, where [Z] denotes the homeomorphism class of Z. A space X is topologically reconstructible if whenever \mathcal{D}(X)=\mathcal{D}(Y) then X is homeomorphic to Y.   It is shown that all metrizable compact connected spaces are reconstructible. It follows that all finite graphs, when viewed as a 1-dimensional cell-complex, are reconstructible in the topological sense, and more generally, that all compact graph-like spaces are reconstructible.
