Let B_{1}(\Omega, \mathbb R) be the first Baire class of real functions in the pluri-fine topology on an open set \Omega \subseteq \mathbb C^{n} and let H_{1}^{*}(\Omega, \mathbb R) be the first functional Lebesgue class of real functions in the same topology. We prove the equality B_{1}(\Omega, \mathbb R)=H_{1}^{*}(\Omega, \mathbb R) and show that for every f\in B_{1}(\Omega, \mathbb R) there is a separately continuous function g: \Omega^{2} \to\mathbb R in the pluri-fine topology on \Omega^2 such that f is the diagonal of g.
