The deck, \mathcal{D}(X), of a topological space X is the set \mathcal{D}(X)=\{[X \setminus \{x\}]\colon x \in X\}, where [Y] denotes the homeomorphism class of Y. A space X is (topologically) reconstructible if whenever \mathcal{D}(Z)=\mathcal{D}(X) then Z is homeomorphic to X. It is known that every (metrizable) continuum is reconstructible, whereas the Cantor set is non-reconstructible.   The main result of this paper characterises the non-reconstructible compact metrizable spaces as precisely those where for each point x there is a sequence \langle B_n^x \colon n \in \mathbb{N}\rangle of pairwise disjoint clopen subsets converging to x such that B_n^x and B_n^y are homeomorphic for each n, and all x and y.   In a non-reconstructible compact metrizable space the set of 1-point components forms a dense G_\delta. For h-homogeneous spaces, this condition is sufficient for non-reconstruction. A wide variety of spaces with a dense G_\delta set of 1-point components are presented, some reconstructible and others not reconstructible.
