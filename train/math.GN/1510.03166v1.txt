Garret Birkhoff's HSP theorem characterizes the classes of models of algebraic theories as those being closed with respect to homomorphic images, subalgebras, and products. In particular, it implies that an algebra \mathbf{B} satisfies all equations that hold in an algebra \mathbf{A} of the same type if and only if \mathbf{B} is a homomorphic image of a subalgebra of a (possibly infinite) direct power of \mathbf{A}. The former statement is equivalent to the existence of a natural map sending term functions of the algebra \mathbf{A} to those of \mathbf{B}, and it is natural to wonder about continuity properties of this mapping. We show that this map is uniformly continuous if and only if every finitely generated subalgebra of \mathbf{B} is a homomorphic image of a subalgebra of a finite power of \mathbf{A} -- without any additional assumptions concerning the algebras \mathbf{A} and \mathbf{B}. Moreover, provided that \mathbf{A} is almost locally finite (for instance if \mathbf{A} is locally oligomorphic or locally finite), the considered map is uniformly continuous if and only if it is Cauchy-continuous. In particular, our results extend a recent theorem by Bodirsky and Pinsker beyond the countable \omega-categorical setting.
