Consider rings of single variable real analytic or complex entire functions, denoted by \mathbb{K}\langle z\rangle. We study "discrete z-filters" on \mathbb{K} and their connections with the space of maximal ideals of \mathbb{K}\langle z\rangle, which we characterize as a compact T_1 space \theta \mathbb{K} of discrete z-ultrafilters on \mathbb{K}. We show that \theta \mathbb{K} is a bijective continuous image of \beta \mathbb{K} \setminus Q(\mathbb{K}), where Q(\mathbb{K}) is the set of far points of \beta \mathbb{K}. \theta \mathbb{K} turns out to be the Wallman compactification of the canonically embedded image of \mathbb{K} inside \theta\mathbb{K}. Using our characterization of \theta\mathbb{K}, we derive a Gelfand-Kolmogorov characterization of maximal ideals of \mathbb{K}\langle z\rangle and show that the Krull dimension of \mathbb{K}\langle z\rangle is at least c. We also establish the existence of a chain of prime z-filters on \mathbb{K} consisting of at least 2^c many elements.
