This paper is a continuation of the work done in \cite{sal-yas} and \cite{may-pat-rob}. We deal with the Vietoris hyperspace of all nontrivial convergent sequences \mathcal{S}_c(X) of a space X. We answer some questions in \cite{sal-yas} and generalize several results in \cite{may-pat-rob}. We prove that: The connectedness of X implies the connectedness of \mathcal{S}_c(X); the local connectedness of X is equivalent to the local connectedness of \mathcal{S}_c(X); and the path-wise connectedness of \mathcal{S}_c(X) implies the path-wise connectedness of X. We also show that the space of nontrivial convergent sequences on the Warsaw circle has \mathfrak{c}-many path-wise connected components, and provide a dendroid with the same property.
