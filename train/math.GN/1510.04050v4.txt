We show that an arbitrary infinite graph can be compactified by its {\aleph_0}-tangles in much the same way as the ends of a locally finite graph compactify it in its Freudenthal compactification. In general, the ends then appear as a subset of its {\aleph_0}-tangles.   The {\aleph_0}-tangles of a graph are shown to form an inverse limit of the ultrafilters on the sets of components obtained by deleting a finite set of vertices. The {\aleph_0}-tangles that are ends are precisely the limits of principal ultrafilters.   The {\aleph_0}-tangles that correspond to a highly connected part, or \aleph_0-block, of the graph are shown to be precisely those that are closed in the topological space of its finite-order separations.
