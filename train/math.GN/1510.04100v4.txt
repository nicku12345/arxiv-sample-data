We present a proof for certain cases of the noncommutative Borsuk-Ulam conjectures proposed by Baum, D\k{a}browski, and Hajac. When a unital C^*-algebra A admits a free action of \mathbb{Z}/k\mathbb{Z}, k \geq 2, there is no equivariant map from A to the C^*-algebraic join of A and the compact "quantum" group C(\mathbb{Z}/k\mathbb{Z}). This also resolves D\k{a}browski's conjecture on unreduced suspensions of C^*-algebras. Finally, we formulate a different type of noncommutative join than the previous authors, which leads to additional open problems for finite cyclic group actions.
