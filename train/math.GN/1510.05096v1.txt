In the paper we study the preservation of pseudocompactness (resp., countable compactness, sequential compactness, \omega-boundedness, totally countable compactness, countable pracompactness, sequential pseudocompactness) by Tychonoff products of pseudocompact (and countably compact) to\-pological Brandt \lambda_i^0-extensions of semitopological monoids with zero. In particular we show that if \big\{ \big(B^0_{\lambda_i}(S_i),\tau^0_{B(S_i)}\big) \colon i\in\mathscr{I}\big\} is a family of Hausdorff pseudocompact to\-pological Brandt \lambda_i^0-extensions of pseudocompact semitopological monoids with zero such that the Tychonoff product \prod\left\{ S_i \colon i\in\mathscr{I}\right\} is a pseudocompact space then the direct product \prod\big\{ \big(B^0_{\lambda_i}(S_i),\tau^0_{B(S_i)}\big) \colon i\in\mathscr{I}\big\} endowed with the Tychonoff topology is a Hausdorff pseudocompact semitopological semigroup.
