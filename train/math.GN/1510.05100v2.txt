A topological group G is called 2-swelling if for any compact subsets A,B\subset G and elements a,b,c\in G the inclusions aA\cup bB\subset A\cup B and aA\cap bB\subset c(A\cap B) are equivalent to the equalities aA\cup bB=A\cup B and aA\cap bB=c(A\cap B). We prove that an (abelian) topological group G is 2-swelling if each 3-generated (resp. 2-generated) subgroup of G is discrete. This implies that the additive group \mathbb Q of rationals is 2-swelling and each locally finite topological group is 2-swelling.
