We prove a result on perfect cliques with respect to countably many G-delta relations on a complete metric space. As an application, we show that a Polish group contains a free subgroup generated by a perfect set as long as it contains any uncountable free subgroup. This answers a recent question of G{\l}\c{a}b and Strobin.
