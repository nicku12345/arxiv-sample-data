A Hausdorff topological group topology on a group G is the minimum (Hausdorff) group topology if it is contained in every Hausdorff group topology on G. For every compact metrizable space X containing an open n-cell, n\ge2, the homeomorphism group H(X) has no minimum Hausdorff group topology. The homeomorphism groups of the Cantor set and the Hilbert cube have no minimum group topology. For every compact metrizable space X containing a dense open one-manifold, H(X) has the minimum group topology. Some, but not all, oligomorphic groups have the minimum group topology.
