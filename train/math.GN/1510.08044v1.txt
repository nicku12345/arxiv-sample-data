We use convergence theory as the framework for studying H-closed spaces and H-sets in topological spaces. From this viewpoint, it becomes clear that the property of being H-closed and the property of being an H-set in a topological space are pretopological notions. Additionally, we define a version of H-closedness for pretopological spaces and investigate the properties of such a space.
