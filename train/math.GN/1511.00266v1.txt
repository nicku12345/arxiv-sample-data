Although inverse limits with factor spaces indexed by the positive integers are most commonly studied, Ingram and Mahavier have defined inverse limits with set-valued functions broadly enough for any directed index set to be used. In this paper, we investigate generalized inverse limits whose factor spaces are indexed by totally ordered sets. Using information about the projections of such inverse limits onto finitely many coordinates, we generalize various well-known theorems on connectedness in inverse limits. Moreover, numerous theorems and examples are given addressing the special case of an inverse limit with a single idempotent surjective u.s.c. bonding function.
