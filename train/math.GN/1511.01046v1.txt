We say that a topological group G is partially box \kappa-resolvable if there exist a dense subset B of G and a subset A  of G, |A|=\kappa such that the subsets \{ aB: a\in A\} are pairwise disjoint. If G=AB then G is called box \kappa-resolvable. We prove two theorems. If a topological group G contains an injective convergent sequence then G is box \omega-resolvable. Every infinite totally bounded topological group G is partially box n-resolvable for each natural number n, and G is box \kappa-resolvable for each infinite cardinal \kappa, \kappa<|G|.
