We extend the Dikranjan-Uspenskij notions of c-compact and h-complete topological group to the morphism level, study the stability properties of the newly defined types of maps, such as closure under direct products, and compare them with their counterparts in topology. We assume Hausdorffness only when our proofs require us to do so, which leads to new results and the affirmation of some facts that were known in a Hausdorff context.
