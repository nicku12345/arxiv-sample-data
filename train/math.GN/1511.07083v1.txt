Given a continuum X, for each A\subseteq X, the Jones' set function \mathcal{T} is defined by \mathcal{T}(A)=\{x\in X : \text{for each subcontinuum }K\text{ such that }x\in \textrm{Int}(K), \text{ then }K\cap A\neq\emptyset\}. We show that \mathcal{D}=\{\mathcal{T}(\{x\}):x\in X\} is decomposition of X when \mathcal{T} is continuous. We present a characterization of the continuity of \mathcal{T} and answer several open questions posed by D. Bellamy.
