Some concepts, such as non-compactness measure and condensing operators, defined on metric spaces are extended to uniform spaces. Such extensions allow us to locate, in the context of uniform spaces, some classical results existing in nonlinear analysis. An application of our results is given for operators defined on locally convex spaces. The main aim of this work is to unify some well-known results existing in complete metric and vector topological spaces.
