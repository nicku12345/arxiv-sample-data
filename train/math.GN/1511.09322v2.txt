Recall that the Rado graph is the unique countable graph that realizes all one-point extensions of its finite subgraphs. The Rado graph is well-known to be universal and homogeneous in the sense that every isomorphism between finite subgraphs of R extends to an automorphism of R.   We construct a graph of the smallest uncountable cardinality \omega_1 which has the same extension property as R, yet its group of automorphisms is trvial. We also present a similar, although technically more complicated, construction of a complete metric space of density \omega_1, having the extension property like the Urysohn space, yet again its group of isometries is trivial. This improves a recent result of Bielas.
