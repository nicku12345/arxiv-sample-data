We introduce and study adhesive spaces. Using this concept we obtain a characterization of stable Baire maps f:X\to Y of the class \alpha for wide classes of topological spaces. In particular, we prove that for a topological space X and a contractible space Y a map f:X\to Y belongs to the n'th stable Baire class if and only if there exist a sequence (f_k)_{k=1}^\infty of continuous maps f_k:X\to Y and a sequence (F_k)_{k=1}^\infty of functionally ambiguous sets of the n'th class in X such that f|_{F_k}=f_k|_{F_k} for every k. Moreover, we show that every monotone function f:\mathbb R\to \mathbb R is of the \alpha'th stable Baire class if and only if it belongs to the first stable Baire class.
