We study strongly separately continuous real-valued function defined on the Banach spaces \ell_p. Determining sets for the class of strongly separately continuous functions on \ell_p are characterized. We prove that for every 1\le \alpha<\omega_1 there exists a strongly separately continuous function which belongs the (\alpha+1)'th Baire class and does not belong to the \alpha'th Baire class on \ell_p. We show that any open set in \ell_p is the set of discontinuities of a strongly separately continuous real-valued function.
