The family of Wilder continua in cubes of dimension > 2 and its two subfamilies-of continuum-wise Wilder continua and of hereditarily arcwise connected continua-are recognized as coanalytic absorbers in the hyperspace of subcontinua of the cubes. In particular, each of them is homeomorphic to the set of all nonempty countable closed subsets of the unit interval.
