Very recently, Mehadi et al [M. Asadi, E. Karap{\i}nar, and P. Salimi, New extension of partial metric spaces with some fixed-point results on M-metric spaces] extended the partial metric spaces to the notion of M-metric spaces. In this article, we study some relations between partial metric spaces and M-metric spaces. Also, we generalize Caristi Kirki's Theorem from partial metric spaces to M-metric spaces, where we corrected some gaps in the proof of the main Theorem in E. Karap\i nar [E. Karap\i nar, Generalizations of Caristi Kirk's Theorem on Partial Metric Spaces, Fixed Point Theory Appl. 2011: 4, (2011)].   We close our contribution by introducing some examples to validate and verify our extension results.
