We introduce a class of \beta-v-unfavorable spaces, which contains some known classes of \beta-unfavorable spaces for topological games of Choquet type. It is proved that every \beta-v-unfavorable space X is a Namioka space, that is for any compact space Y and any separately continuous function f:X\times Y\to \mathbb R there exists a dense in X G_{\delta}-set A\subseteq X such that f is jointly continuous at each point of A\times Y.
