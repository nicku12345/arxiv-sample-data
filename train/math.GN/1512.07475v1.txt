We prove that, for an interval X\subseteq \mathbb R and a normed space Z diagonals of separately absolute continuous mappings f:X^2\to Z are exactly such mappings \mbox{g:X\to Z} that there is a sequence (g_n)_{n=1}^{\infty} of continuous mappings g_n:X\to Z with \lim\limits_{n\to\infty}g_n(x)=g(x) and \mbox{\sum\limits_{n=1}^{\infty}\|g_{n+1}(x)-g_n(x)\|<\infty} for every x\in X.
