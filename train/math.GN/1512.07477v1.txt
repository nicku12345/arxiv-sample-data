It is studied a connection between the separability and the countable chain condition of spaces with the L-property (a topological space X has the L-property if for every topological space Y, separately continuous function f:X\times Y\to\mathbb R and open set I\subseteq \mathbb R the set f^{-1}(I) is a F_{\sigma}-set). We show that every completely regular Baire space with the L-property and the countable chain condition is separable and construct a nonseparable completely regular space with the L-property and the countable chain condition. This gives a negative answer to a question of M.~Burke.
