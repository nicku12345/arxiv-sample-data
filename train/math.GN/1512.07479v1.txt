We prove that every point-finite family of nonempty functionally open sets in a topological space X has the cardinality at most an infinite cardinal \kappa if and only if w(X)\leq\kappa for every Valdivia compact space Y\subseteq C_p(X). Correspondingly a Valdivia compact space Y has the weight at most an infinite cardinal \kappa if and only if every point-finite family of nonempty open sets in C_p(Y) has the cardinality at most \kappa, that is p(C_p(Y))\leq \kappa. Besides, it was proved that w(Y)=p(C_p(Y)) for every linearly ordered compact Y. In particular, a Valdivia compact space or linearly ordered compact space Y is metrizable if and only if p(C_p(Y))=\aleph_0. This gives answer to a question of O.~Okunev and V.~Tkachuk.
