Given a Tychonoff space X, let F(X) and A(X) be respectively the free topological group and the free Abelian topological group over X in the sense of Markov. In this paper, we consider two topological properties of F(X) or A(X), namely the countable tightness and \mathfrak G-base. We provide some characterizations of the countable tightness and \mathfrak G-base of F(X) and A(X) for various special classes of spaces X. Furthermore, we also study the countable tightness and \mathfrak G-base of some F_{n}(X) of F(X).
