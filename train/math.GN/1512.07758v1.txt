It is solved a problem of construction of separately continuous functions on the product of compacts with a given discontinuity points set. We obtaine the following results.   1. For arbitrary \v{C}ech complete spaces X, Y and a separable compact perfect projectively nowhere dense zero set E\subseteq X\times Y there exists a separately continuous function f:X\times Y\to\mathbb R the discontinuity points set of which equals to E.   2. For arbitrary \v{C}ech complete spaces X, Y and nowhere dense zero sets A\subseteq X and B\subseteq Y there exists a separately continuous function f:X\times Y\to\mathbb R such that the projections of the discontinuity points set of f coincide with A and B respectively.   An example of Eberlein compacts X, Y and nowhere dense zero sets A\subseteq X and B\subseteq Y such that the discontinuity points set of every separately continuous function f:X\times Y\to\mathbb R does not coincide with A\times B, and CH-example of separable Valdivia compacts X, Y and separable nowhere dense zero sets A\subseteq X and B\subseteq Y such that the discontinuity points set of every separately continuous function f:X\times Y\to\mathbb R does not coincide with A\times B are constructed.
