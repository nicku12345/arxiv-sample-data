It is proved that a differentiable with respect to each variable function f:\mathbb R^2\to\mathbb R is a solution of the equation  \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial u}{\partial y}=0 if and only if there exists a function \varphi:\mathbb R\to\mathbb R such that f(x,y)=\varphi(x-y). This gives a positive answer to a question of R.~Baire. Besides, we use this result to solving analogous partial differential equations in abstract spaces and partial differential equations of higher-order.
