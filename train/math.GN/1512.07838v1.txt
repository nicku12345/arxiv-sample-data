Our main technical tool is a principally new property of compact narrow operators which works for a domain space without an absolutely continuous norm. It is proved that for every K\"{o}the F-space X and for every locally convex F-space Y the sum T_1+T_2 of a narrow operator T_1:X\to Y and a compact narrow operator T_2:X\to Y is a narrow operator. This gives a positive answers to questions asked by M.~Popov and B.~Randrianantoanina (\cite[Problem 5.6 and Problem 11.63]{PR})
