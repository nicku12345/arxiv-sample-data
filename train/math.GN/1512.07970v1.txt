It is shown that for a function f:\mathbb R^2\to \mathbb R which is measurable with respect to the first variable and upper semicontinuous quasicontinuous and increasing with respect to the second variable there exists a Caratheodory's solution y(x)=y_0+\int\limits_{x_0}^xf(t,y(t))d\mu(t) of the Cauchy problem y'(x)=f(x,y(x)) with the initial condition y(x_0)=y_0. There are constructed examples which indicate to essentiality of condition of increasing and give the negative answer to a question of Z.~Grande.
