A negative solution of Problem 188 posed by Max Eidelheit in {\it the Scottish Book} concerning superpositions of separately absolutely continuous functions is presented. We discuss here his and some related problems which have also negative solutions. Finally, we give an explanation of such negative answers from the "embeddings of Banach spaces" point of view.
