In this survey, 37 questions on point-countable covers and sequence-covering mappings are listed, in which some of these questions have been answered. These questions are mainly related to the theory of generalized metric spaces, involving point-countable covers, sequence-covering mappings, images of metric spaces and hereditarily closure-preserving families.
