In this paper, we define notions of P_{Z}(S)-metric and P_{Z}(S)-metric space and we show that every P_{Z}(S)-metric Space, analogous to an ordinary metric space and generally, a \Lambda-metric space, is a topological space, and in continuance, we show that from a topological point of view, some properties of P_{Z}(S)-metric spaces, and \Lambda-metric spaces, have coordination.
