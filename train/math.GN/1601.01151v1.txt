We study algebraic structure of the \lambda-polycyclic monoid P_{\lambda} and its topologizations. We show that the \lambda-polycyclic monoid for an infinite cardinal \lambda\geqslant 2 has similar algebraic properties so has the polycyclic monoid P_n with finitely many n\geqslant 2 generators. In particular we prove that for every infinite cardinal \lambda the polycyclic monoid P_{\lambda} is a congruence-free combinatorial 0-bisimple 0-E-unitary inverse semigroup. Also we show that every non-zero element x is an isolated point in (P_{\lambda},\tau) for every Hausdorff topology \tau on P_{\lambda}, such that (P_{\lambda},\tau) is a semitopological semigroup, and every locally compact Hausdorff semigroup topology on P_\lambda is discrete. The last statement extends results of the paper [33] obtaining for topological inverse graph semigroups. We describe all feebly compact topologies \tau on P_{\lambda} such that \left(P_{\lambda},\tau\right) is a semitopological semigroup and its Bohr compactification as a topological semigroup. We prove that for every cardinal \lambda\geqslant 2 any continuous homomorphism from a topological semigroup P_\lambda into an arbitrary countably compact topological semigroup is annihilating and there exists no a Hausdorff feebly compact topological semigroup which contains P_{\lambda} as a dense subsemigroup.
