It is investigated the existence of a separately continuous function f:X\times Y\to \mathbb R with an onepoint set of discontinuity for topological spaces X and Y which satisfy compactness type conditions. In particular, it is shown that for compact spaces X and Y and nonizolated points x_0\in X and y_0\in Y there exists a separately continuous function f:X\times Y\to \mathbb R with the set \{(x_0,y_0)\} of discontinuity points if and only if there exist sequences of nonempty functional open sets which converge to x_0 and y_0 in X and Y respectively.
