We prove the following results.   1. If X is a \alpha-favourable space, Y is a regular space, in which every separable closed set is compact, and f:X\times Y\to\mathbb R is a separately continuous everywhere jointly discontinuous function, then there exists a subspace Y_0\subseteq Y which is homeomorphic to \beta\mathbb N.   2. There exist a \alpha-favourable space X, a dense in \beta\mathbb N\setminus\mathbb N countably compact space Y and a separately continuous everywhere jointly discontinuous function f:X\times Y\to\mathbb R.   Besides, it was obtained some conditions equivalent to the fact that the space C_p(\beta\mathbb N\setminus\mathbb N,\{0,1\}) of all continuous functions x:\beta\mathbb N\setminus\mathbb N\to\{0,1\} with the topology of point-wise convergence is a Baire space.
