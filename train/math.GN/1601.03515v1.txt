In this paper, we derive more on \alpha^{m}-continuous functions and \alpha^{m}-irresolute functions with \alpha^{m}-open maps and \alpha^{m}-closed maps in topological spaces also we introduce I_{\alpha^{m}}(A) and C_{\alpha^{m}}(A) by using the \alpha^{m}-open sets and \alpha^{m}-closed sets and studied some of their properties.
