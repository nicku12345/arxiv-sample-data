Based on a newly proposed spatial data model - spatial chromatic model (SCM), we developed a spatial coding scheme, called full-coded ordinary arranged chromatic diagram (full-OACD). Full-OACD is a type of spatial tessellation, where space is partitioned into a number of subspaces such as cells, edges, and vertexes. These subspaces are called spatial particles and assigned with unique codes - chromatic codes. The generation, structures, computations, and properties of full-OACD are introduced and relations between chromatic codes and particle spatial topology are investigated, indicating that chromatic codes provide a potential useful and meaningful tool not only for spatial analysis in geographical information science, but also for other relevant disciplines such as discrete mathematics, topology, and computer science.
