We develop a theory of projective Fraisse limits in the spirit of Irwin- Solecki. The structures here will additionally support dual semantics as in [Sl10, Sl12]. Let Y be a compact metrizable space and let G be a closed subgroup of Homeo(Y). We show that there is always a projective Frasse limit K and a closed definable equivalence relation r on K, so that the quotient of K under r is homeomorphic to Y and the projection of K on Y induces a continuous group embedding of Aut(K) into G with dense image.
