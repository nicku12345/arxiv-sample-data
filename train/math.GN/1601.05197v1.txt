We prove the following two results.   1. If X is a completely regular space such that for every topological space Y each separately continuous function f:X\times Y\to\mathbb R is of the first Baire class, then every Lindel\"of subspace of X bijectively continuously maps onto a separable metrizable space.   2. If X is a Baire space, Y is a compact space and f:X\times Y\to\mathbb R is a separately continuous function which is a Baire measurable function, then there exists a dense in X G_{\delta}-set A such that f is jointly continuous at every point of A\times Y (this gives a positive answer to a question of G. Vera).
