Assuming that there is a stationary set in \omega_{2} of ordinals of countable cofinality that does not reflect, we prove that there exists a compact space which is not Corson compact and whose all continuous images of weight at most \omega_1 are Eberlein compacta. This yields an example of a Banach space of density \omega_{2} which is not weakly compactly generated but all its subspaces of density \omega_{1} are weakly compactly generated. We also prove that under Martin's axiom countable functional tightness does not reflect in small continuous images of compacta.
