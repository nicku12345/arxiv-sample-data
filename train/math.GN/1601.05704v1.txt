In this paper we prove that if \gamma is a Jordan curve on \mathbb{S}^2 then there is a smooth curve shortening flow defined on (0,T) which converges to \gamma in \mathcal{C}^0 as t\to 0^+ . Another perspective is that the level-set flow of \gamma is smooth. This is a generalization of the author's previous work where the planar case was studied. If a Jordan curve on \mathbb{S}^2 has Lebesgue measure zero then we show that the level-set flow instantly becomes a smooth closed curve. If the Lebesgue measure is positive then for small time the level-set flow is an annulus with smooth boundary. This second case should be interpreted as a failure of uniqueness.   As in the planar case a key step in the proof is establishing a length estimate for smooth curves that depends on a geometric quantity called the r-multiplicity. The majority of this paper concerns the extension of this length estimate to \mathbb{S}^2.
