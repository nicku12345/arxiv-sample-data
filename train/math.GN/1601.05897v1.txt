The cross topology \gamma on a product of topological spaces X and Y is the collection of all sets G\subseteq X\times Y such that the intersection of G with every vertical line and every horizontal line is an open subset of either vertical or horizontal line, respectively.   For spaces X and Y from a wide class, which includes all spaces \mathbb R^n, we prove that there exists a separately continuous mapping f:X\times Y\to (X\times Y,\gamma) which is not a pointwise limit of a sequence of continuous functions. Also we prove that every separately continuous mapping is a pointwise limit of a sequence of continuous mappings, if it is defined on the product of a strongly zero-dimensional metrizable and a topological space and acts into a topological space.
