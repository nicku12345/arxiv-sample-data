It is shown that for any Baire space X, linearly ordered compact spaces Y_1,\dots, Y_n, compact space Y\subseteq Y_1\times\cdots \times Y_n such that for every parallelepiped W\subseteq Y_1\times\cdots \times Y_n the set Y\cap W is connected, and separately continuous mapping f:X\times Y\to\mathbb R there exists a dense in X G_\delta-set A\subseteq X such that f is jointly continuous at every point of A\times Y.
