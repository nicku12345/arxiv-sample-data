In this paper we introduce FG- coupled fixed point, which is a generalization of coupled fixed point for nonlinear mappings in partially ordered complete metric spaces. We discuss existence and uniqueness theorems of FG- coupled fixed points for different contractive mappings. Our theorems generalizes the results of Gnana Bhaskar and Lakshmikantham [T. Gnana Bhaskar, V. Lakshmikantham; Fixed point theorems in partially ordered metric spaces and applications; Nonlinear Analysis 65 (2006) 1379 -1393].
