We solve a problem on a construction of a separately continuous mapping with the given diagonal, which is the pointwise limit of a sequence of continuous mappings valued in an equiconnected space. We construct an example of a closed-valued separately continuous mapping f:[0,1]^2\to \mathbb R with an everywhere discontinuous diagonal. The example shows that the results on the joint continuity point set of compact-valued separately continuous mappings can not be generalized to the case of closed-valued mappings.
