A family of closed subsets of a topological space X is called a (strict) Cld-fan in X if this family is (strictly) compact-finite but not locally finite in X. Applications of (strict) Cld-fans are based on a simple observation that k-spaces contain no Cld-fan and Ascoli spaces contain no strict Cld-fan. In this paper we develop the machinery of (strict) fans and apply it to detecting the k-space and Ascoli properties in spaces that naturally appear in General Topology, Functional Analysis, and Topological Algebra. In particular, we detect (generalized) metric spaces X whose functor-spaces, functions spaces, free (para)topological (abelian) groups, free (locally convex) linear topological spaces, free (Lawson) topological semilattices, and free (para)topological (Clifford, Abelian) inverse semigroups are k-spaces or Ascoli spaces.
