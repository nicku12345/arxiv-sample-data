In the paper, we recall the Wallman compactification of a Tychonoff space T (denoted by \text{Wall}(T)) and the contribution made by Gillman and Jerison. Motivated by the Gelfand-Naimark theorem, we investigate the homeomorphism between BC(T,\mathbb{R}) and BC(\text{Wall}(T),\mathbb{R}). Along the way, we attempt to justify the advantages of Wallman compactification over other manifestations of Stone-\v{C}ech compactification. The main result of the paper is a new form of Arzel\`a-Ascoli theorem, which introduces the concept of equicontinuity along \omega-ultrafilters.
