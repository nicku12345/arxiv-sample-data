A filter \F on \w is called Fr\'echet-Urysohn if the space with only one non-isolated point \w \cup \{\F\} is a Fr\'echet-Urysohn space, where the neighborhoods of the non-isolated point are determined by the elements of \F. In this paper, we distinguish some Fr\'echet-Urysohn filters by using two pre-orderings of filters: One is the Rudin-Keisler pre-order and the other one was introduced by Todor\v{c}evi\'c-Uzc\'ategui in \cite{tu05}. In this paper, we construct an RK-chain of size \c^+ which is RK-above of avery FU-filter. Also, we show that there is an infinite RK-antichain of FU-filters.
