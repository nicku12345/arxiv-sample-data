Let K be a compact Hausdorff space and let (f_n)_{n\in \N} be a pairwise disjoint sequence of continuous functions from K into [0,1]. We say that a compact space L \emph{adds supremum} of (f_n)_{n\in \N} in K if there exists a continuous surjection \pi:L\longrightarrow K such that there exists sup\{f_n\circ\pi:n\in \N\} in C(L). Moreover, we expect that L preserves suprema of disjoint continuous functions which already existed in C(K). Namely, if sup\{g_n:n\in \N\} exists in C(K), we must have sup\{g_n\circ\pi:n\in \N\} in C(L).   This paper studies the preservation of connectedness in extensions by continuous functions -- a technique developed by Piotr Koszmider to add suprema of continuous functions on Hausdorff connected compact spaces -- proving the following results:   (1) If K is a metrizable and locally connected compactum, then any extension of K by continuous functions is connected (but it may be not locally connected).   (2) There exists a disconnected extension of a metrizable connected compactum K.   (3) For any metrizable compactum K there exists a disconnected L which is obtained from K by finitely many extensions by continuous functions.
