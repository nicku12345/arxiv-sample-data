In this paper we continue our research of functions on the boundary of their domain and obtain some results on cluster sets of functions between topological spaces. In particular, we prove that for a metrizable topological space X, a dense subspace Y of a metrizable compact space \overline{Y}, a closed nowhere dense subset L of X, an upper continuous compact-valued multifunction {\Phi:L\multimap \overline{Y}} and a set D\subseteq X\setminus L such that L\subseteq \overline{D}, there exists a function f:D\to Y such that the cluster set \overline{f} (x) is equal to \Phi (x) for any x\in L.
