The purpose of this paper is to investigate the duality between large scale and small scale. It is done by creating a connection between C*-algebras and scale structures. In the commutative case we consider C*-subalgebras of C^b(X), the C*-algebra of bounded complex-valued functions on X. Namely, each C*-subalgebra \mathscr{C} of C^b(X) induces both a small scale structure on X and a large scale structure on X. The small scale structure induced on X corresponds (or is analogous) to the restriction of C^b(h(X)) to X, where h(X) is the Higson compactification. The large scale structure induced on X is a generalization of the C_0-coarse structure of N.Wright. Conversely, each small scale structure on X induces a C*-subalgebra of C^b(X) and each large scale structure on X induces a C*-subalgebra of C^b(X). To accomplish the full correspondence between scale structures on X and C*-subalgebras of C^b(X) we need to enhance the scale structures to what we call hybrid structures. In the noncommutative case we consider C*-subalgebras of bounded operators B(l_2(X)).
