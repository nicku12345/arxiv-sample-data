We call a \emph{comb} a map f:I\to [0,\infty), where I is a compact interval, such that \{f\ge \varepsilon\} is finite for any \varepsilon. A comb induces a (pseudo)-distance \dtf on \{f=0\} defined by \dtf(s,t) = \max_{(s\wedge t, s\vee t)} f. We describe the completion \bar I of \{f=0\} for this metric, which is a compact ultrametric space called \emph{comb metric space}.   Conversely, we prove that any compact, ultrametric space (U,d) without isolated points is isometric to a comb metric space. We show various examples of the comb representation of well-known ultrametric spaces: the Kingman coalescent, infinite sequences of a finite alphabet, the p-adic field and spheres of locally compact real trees. In particular, for a rooted, locally compact real tree defined from its contour process h, the comb isometric to the sphere of radius T centered at the root can be extracted from h as the depths of its excursions away from T.
