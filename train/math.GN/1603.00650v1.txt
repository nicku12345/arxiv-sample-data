We answer two questions from {\it V.Bykov, On Baire class one functions on a product space, Topol. Appl. {199} (2016) 55--62,} and prove that every Baire one function on a subspace of a countable perfectly normal product is the pointwise limit of a sequence of continuous functions, each depending on finitely many coordinates. It is proved also that a lower semicontinuous function on a subspace of a countable perfectly normal product is the pointwise limit of an increasing sequence of continuous functions, each depending on finitely many coordinates, if and only if the function has a minorant which depends on finitely many coordinates.
