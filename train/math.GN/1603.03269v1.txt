Let  S_g  be a closed surface of genus  g  and let  (\alpha, \beta)  be a filling pair on  S_g ; then  i(\alpha, \beta) \geq 2g-1 , where  i  is the (geometric) intersection number. Aougab and Huang demonstrated that (exponentially many) minimally-intersecting filling pairs exist on  S_g  when  g > 2  by a construction which produces higher-genus surfaces with filling pairs as connected sums of lower-genus surfaces with filling pairs. We present a generalization of their construction which provides an explicit, algebraic means of determining the homeomorphism class of the resulting pair, and a criterion for determining when a surface with minimally-intersecting filling pair admits a decomposition as a connected sum.
