We investigate the class of continuous images of non-commutative Valdivia compact spaces, in particular its subclass of weakly non-commutative Cor- son countably compact spaces. A key tool is the study of non-commutative Corson countably compact spaces and their stability. The results are the non- commutative version of results by O. Kalenda (2003). Moreover, we present a study of retractional skeletons on Aleksandrov duplicates of ordinal spaces.
