Let T(A,\mathcal{D}) be a self-affine set generated by an expanding matrix A=\left[\begin{array}{rr} p & 0\cr -a & q \end{array}\right] and a product digit set \mathcal{D}=\{0,1,\dots,m-1\}\times \{0,1,\dots,n-1\}. We provide a necessary and sufficient condition for the T(A,\mathcal{D}) to be connected, which generalizes the known results.
