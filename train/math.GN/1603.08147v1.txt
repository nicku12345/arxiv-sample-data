We give sufficient conditions when a topological inverse \lambda-polycyclic monoid P_{\lambda} is absolutely H-closed in the class of topological inverse semigroups. Also, for every infinite cardinal \lambda we construct the coarsest semigroup inverse topology \tau_{mi} on P_\lambda and give an example of a topological inverse monoid S which contains the polycyclic monoid P_2 as a dense discrete subsemigroup.
