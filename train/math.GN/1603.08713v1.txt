Given two ordinal \lambda and \gamma, let f:[0,\lambda) \rightarrow [0,\gamma) be a function such that, for each \alpha<\gamma, \sup\{f(t): t\in[0, \alpha]\}<\gamma. We define a mapping d_{f}: [0,\lambda)\times [0,\lambda) \longrightarrow [0,\gamma) by the rule: if x<y then d_{f}(x,y)= d_{f}(y,x)= \sup\{f(t): t\in(x,y]\}, d(x,x)=0. The pair ([0,\lambda), d_{f}) is called a \gamma-comb defined by f. We show that each cellular ordinal ballean can be represented as a \gamma-comb. In {\it General Asymptology}, cellular ordinal balleans play a part of ultrametric spaces.
