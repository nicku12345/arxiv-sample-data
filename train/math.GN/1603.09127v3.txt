In this article we study two "strong" topologies for spaces of smooth functions from a finite-dimensional manifold to a (possibly infinite-dimensional) manifold modeled on a locally convex space. Namely, we construct Whitney type topologies for these spaces and a certain refinement corresponding to Michor's \mathcal{FD}-topology. Then we establish the continuity of certain mappings between spaces of smooth mappings, e.g.\ the continuity of the joint composition map. As a first application we prove that the bisection group of an arbitrary Lie groupoid (with finite-dimensional base) is a topological group (with respect to these topologies). For the reader's convenience the article includes also a proof of the folklore fact that the Whitney topologies defined via jet bundles coincide with the ones defined via local charts.
