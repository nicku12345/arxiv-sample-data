The hyperbolic components in the moduli space {M}_d of degree d\geq2 rational maps are mysterious and fundamental topological objects. For those in the connectedness locus, they are known to be the finite quotients of the Euclidean space \mathbb{R}^{4d-4}. In this paper, we study the hyperbolic components in the disconnectedness locus and with minimal complexity: those in the Cantor circle locus. We show that each of them is a finite quotient of the space \mathbb{R}^{4d-4-n}\times\mathbb{T}^{n}, where n is determined by the dynamics. The proof relates Riemann surface theory (Abel's Theorem), dynamical system and algebraic topology.
