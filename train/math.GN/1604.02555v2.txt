The paper studies the free locally convex space L(X) over a Tychonoff space X. Since for infinite X the space L(X) is never metrizable (even not Fr\'echet-Urysohn), a possible applicable generalized metric property for L(X) is welcome. We propose a concept (essentially weaker than first-countability) which is known under the name a \mathfrak{G}-base. A space X has a {\em \mathfrak{G}-base} if for every x\in X there is a base \{ U_\alpha : \alpha\in\mathbb{N}^\mathbb{N}\} of neighborhoods at x such that U_\beta \subseteq U_\alpha whenever \alpha\leq\beta for all \alpha,\beta\in\mathbb{N}^\mathbb{N}, where \alpha=(\alpha(n))_{n\in\mathbb{N}}\leq \beta=(\beta(n))_{n\in\mathbb{N}} if \alpha(n)\leq\beta(n) for all n\in\mathbb{N}. We show that if X is an Ascoli \sigma-compact space, then L(X) has a \mathfrak{G}-base if and only if X admits an Ascoli uniformity \mathcal{U} with a \mathfrak{G}-base. We prove that if X is a \sigma-compact Ascoli space of \mathbb{N}^\mathbb{N}-uniformly compact type, then L(X) has a \mathfrak{G}-base. As an application we show: (1) if X is a metrizable space, then L(X) has a \mathfrak{G}-base if and only if X is \sigma-compact, and (2) if X is a countable Ascoli space, then L(X) has a \mathfrak{G}-base if and only if X has a \mathfrak{G}-base.
