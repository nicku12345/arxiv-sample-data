In this paper we prove FG-coupled fixed point theorems for different contractive mappings and generalized quasi- contractive mappings in partially ordered complete metric spaces. We prove the existence of FG-coupled fixed points of continuous as well as discontinuous mappings. We give some examples to illustrate the results.
