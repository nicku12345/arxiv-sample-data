We investigate weak and strong structures for generalized topological spaces, among others products, sums, subspaces, quotients, and the complete lattice of generalized topologies on a given set. Also we introduce T_{3.5} generalized topological spaces and give a necessary and sufficient condition for a generalized topological space to be a T_{3.5} space: they are exactly the subspaces of powers of a certain natural generalized topology on [0,1]. For spaces with at least two points here we can have even dense subspaces. Also, T_{3.5} generalized topological spaces are exactly the dense subspaces of compact T_4 generalized topological spaces. We show that normality is productive for generalized topological spaces. For compact generalized topological spaces we prove the analogue of the Tychonoff product theorem. We prove that also Lindel\"ofness (and \kappa -compactness) is productive for generalized topological spaces. On any ordered set we introduce a generalized topology and determine the continuous maps between two such generalized topological spaces: for |X|, |Y| \ge 2 they are the monotonous maps continuous between the respective order topologies. We investigate the relation of sums and subspaces of generalized topological spaces to ways of defining generalized topological spaces.
