We define and study the free topological vector space \mathbb{V}(X) over a Tychonoff space X. We prove that \mathbb{V}(X) is a k_\omega-space if and only if X is a k_\omega-space. If X is infinite, then \mathbb{V}(X) contains a closed vector subspace which is topologically isomorphic to \mathbb{V}(\mathbb{N}). It is proved that if X is a k-space, then \mathbb{V}(X) is locally convex if and only if X is discrete and countable. If X is a metrizable space it is shown that: (1) \mathbb{V}(X) has countable tightness if and only if X is separable, and (2) \mathbb{V}(X) is a k-space if and only if X is locally compact and separable. It is proved that \mathbb{V}(X) is a barrelled topological vector space if and only if X is discrete. This result is applied to free locally convex spaces L(X) over a Tychonoff space X by showing that: (1) L(X) is quasibarrelled if and only if L(X) is barrelled if and only if X is discrete, and (2) L(X) is a Baire space if and only if X is finite.
