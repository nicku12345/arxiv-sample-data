Given a Tychonoff space X, let A(X) be the free Abelian topological group over X in the sense of Markov. For every n\in\mathbb{N}, let A_n(X) denote the subspace of A(X) that consists of words of reduced length at most n with respect to the free basis X. In this paper, we show that A_4(X) is a k-space if and only if A(X) is a k-space for the non-metrizable La\v{s}nev space X, which gives a complementary for one result of K. Yamada's. In addition, we also show that, under the assumption of \flat=\omega_1, the subspace A_3(X) is a k-space if and only if A(X) is a k-space for the non-metrizable La\v{s}nev space X. However, under the assumption of \flat>\omega_1, we provide a non-metrizable La\v{s}nev space X such that A_3(X) is a k-space but A(X) is not a k-space.
