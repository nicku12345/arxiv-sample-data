Two sesquilinear forms \Phi:\mathbb C^m\times\mathbb C^m\to \mathbb C and \Psi:\mathbb C^n\times\mathbb C^n\to \mathbb C are called topologically equivalent if there exists a homeomorphism \varphi :\mathbb C^m\to \mathbb C^n (i.e., a continuous bijection whose inverse is also a continuous bijection) such that \Phi(x,y)=\Psi(\varphi (x),\varphi (y)) for all x,y\in \mathbb C^m. R.A.Horn and V.V.Sergeichuk in 2006 constructed a regularizing decomposition of a square complex matrix A; that is, a direct sum SAS^*=R\oplus J_{n_1}\oplus\dots\oplus J_{n_p}, in which S and R are nonsingular and each J_{n_i} is the n_i-by-n_i singular Jordan block. In this paper, we prove that \Phi and \Psi are topologically equivalent if and only if the regularizing decompositions of their matrices coincide up to permutation of the singular summands J_{n_i} and replacement of R\in\mathbb C^{r\times r} by a nonsingular matrix R'\in\mathbb C^{r\times r} such that R and R' are the matrices of topologically equivalent forms. Analogous results for real and complex bilinear forms are also obtained.
