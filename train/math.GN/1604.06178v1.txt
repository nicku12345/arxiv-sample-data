We give a characterization of countable discrete subspace A of a topological space X such that there exists a (linear) continuous mapping \varphi:C_p^*(A)\to C_p(X) with \varphi(y)|_A=y for every y\in C_p^*(A). Using this characterization we answer two questions of A.~Arhangel'skii. Moreover, we introduce the notion of well-covered subset of a topological space and prove that for well-covered functionally closed subset A of a topological space X there exists a linear continuous mapping \varphi:C_p(A)\to C_p(X) with \varphi(y)|_A=y for every y\in C_p(A).
