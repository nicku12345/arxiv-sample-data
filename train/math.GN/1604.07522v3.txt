We prove that a function f:X\to Y from a first-countable (more generally, Preiss-Simon) space X to a regular space Y is weakly discontinuous (which means that every subspace A\subset X contains an open dense subset U\subset A such that f|U is continuous) if and only if f is open-resolvable (in the sense that for every open subset U\subset Y the preimage f^{-1}(U) is a resolvable subset of X) if and only if f is resolvable (in the sense that for every resolvable subset R\subset Y the preimage f^{-1}(R) is a resolvable subset of X). For functions on metrizable spaces this characterization was announced (without proof) by Vinokurov in 1985.
