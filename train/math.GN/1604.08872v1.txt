We answer a question of S.~Todor\v{c}evi\'c and C.~Uzc\'ategui from \cite{TU1} by showing that the only possible sequential orders of sequential analytic groups are 1 and \omega_1. Other results on the structure of sequential analytic spaces and their relation to other classes of spaces are given as well. In particular, we provide a full topological classification of sequential analytic groups by showing that all such groups are either metrizable or k_\omega-spaces, which, together with a result by Zelenyuk, implies that there are exactly \omega_1 non homeomorphic analytic sequential group topologies.
