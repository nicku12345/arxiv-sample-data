We construct, using \diamondsuit, an example of a sequential group G such that the only countable sequential subgroups of G are closed and discrete, and the only quotients of G that have a countable pseudocharacter are countable and Fr\'echet. We also show how to construct such a G with several additional properties (such as make G^2 sequential, and arrange for every sequential subgroup of G to be closed and contain a nonmetrizable compact subspace, etc.).   Several results about k_\omega sequential groups are proved. In particular, we show that each such group is either locally compact and metrizable or contains a closed copy of the sequential fan. It is also proved that a dense proper subgroup of a non Fr\'echet k_\omega sequential group is not sequential extending a similar observation of T.~Banakh about countable k_\omega groups.
