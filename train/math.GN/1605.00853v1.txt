We consider the class of compact countable subsets of the real numbers \mathbb{R}. By using an appropriate partition, up to homeomorphism, of this class we give a detailed proof of a result shown by S. Mazurkiewicz and W. Sierpinski related to the cardinality of this partition. Furthermore, for any compact subset of \mathbb{R}, we show the existence of a "primitive" related to its Cantor-Bendixson derivative.
