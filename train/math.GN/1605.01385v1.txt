The shift map \sigma on \omega^* is the continuous self-map of \omega^* induced by the function n \mapsto n+1 on \omega. Given a compact Hausdorff space X and a continuous function f: X \rightarrow X, we say that (X,f) is a quotient of (\omega^*,\sigma) whenever there is a continuous surjection Q: \omega^* \to X such that Q \circ \sigma = f \circ Q.   Our main theorem states that if the weight of X is at most \aleph_1, then (X,f) is a quotient of (\omega^*,\sigma) if and only if f is weakly incompressible (which means that no nontrivial open U \subseteq X has f(\bar{U}) \subseteq U). Under CH, this gives a complete characterization of the quotients of (\omega^*,\sigma) and implies, for example, that (\omega^*,\sigma^{-1}) is a quotient of (\omega^*,\sigma).   In the language of topological dynamics, our theorem states that a dynamical system of weight \aleph_1 is an abstract \omega-limit set if and only if it is weakly incompressible.   We complement these results by proving (1) our main theorem remains true when \aleph_1 is replaced by any \kappa < \mathfrak{p}, (2) consistently, the theorem becomes false if we replace \aleph_1 by \aleph_2, and (3) OCA+MA implies that (\omega^*,\sigma^{-1}) is not a quotient of (\omega^*,\sigma).
