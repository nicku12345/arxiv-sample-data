Suppose that a X is an \emph{unshielded} plane continuum (i.e., X coincides with the boundary of the unbounded complementary component of X). Then there exists a \emph{finest monotone} map m:X\to L, where L is a locally connected continuum (i.e., m^{-1}(y) is connected for each y\in L, and any monotone map \varphi:X\to L' onto a locally connected continuum is a composition \varphi=\varphi'\circ m where \varphi':L\to L' is monotone). Such finest locally connected model L of X is easier to understand because L is locally connected (in particular it can be described by a picture) and represents the finest but still understandable decomposition of X into possibly complicated but pairwise disjoint \emph{fibers} (point-preimages) of m. However, in some cases (i.e., in case X is indecomposable) L is a singleton. In this paper we provide sufficient conditions for the existence of a non-degenerate model depending on the existence of certain subcontinua of X and apply these results to the connected Julia sets of polynomials.
