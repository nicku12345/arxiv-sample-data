The main goal of the paper is to prove the existence of the universal cover for RCD^*(K,N)-spaces. This generalizes earlier work of C. Sormani and the second named author on the existence of universal covers for Ricci limit spaces. As a result, we also obtain several structure results on the (revised) fundamental group of such spaces. These are the first topological results for RCD^{*}(K,N)-spaces without extra structural-topological assumptions (such as semi-local simple connectedness).
