For a small quantaloid \mathcal{Q} we consider four fundamental 2-monads \mathbb{T} on \mathcal{Q}\text{-}{\bf Cat}, given by the presheaf 2-monad \mathbb{P} and the copresheaf 2-monad \mathbb{P}^{\dagger}, as well as by their two composite 2-monads, and establish that they all laxly distribute over \mathbb{P}. These four 2-monads therefore admit lax extensions to the category \mathcal{Q}\text{-}{\bf Dist} of \mathcal{Q}-categories and their distributors. We characterize the corresponding (\mathbb{T},\mathcal{Q})-categories in each of the four cases, leading us to both known and novel categorical structures.
