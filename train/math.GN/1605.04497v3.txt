The homological dimension d_G of metric compacta was introduced by Alexandroff. In this paper we provide some general properties of d_G, mainly with an eye towards describing the dimensional full-valuedness of compact metric spaces. As a corollary of the established properties of d_G, we prove that any two-dimensional lc^2 metric compactum is dimensionally full-valued. This improves the well known result of Kodama that every two-dimensional ANR is dimensionally full-valued. Applications for homogeneous metric ANR-compacta are also given.
