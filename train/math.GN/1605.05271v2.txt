A topological space L is called a linear ordered topological space (LOTS) whenever there is a linear order \leq on L such that the topology on L is generated by the open sets of the form (a, b) with a < b and a, b \in L \cup \{ -\infty, +\infty \}. A topological space X is called a generalized ordered space (GO-space) whenever X is topologically embeddable in a LOTS. Main Theorem: Let X be a Hausdorff topological space. Assume that any continuous image of X is a GO-space. Then X is homeomorphic to a countable successor ordinal (with the order topology).   The converse trivially holds.
