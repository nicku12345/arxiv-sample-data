Let X and Y be compact Hausdorff spaces and suppose that there exists a linear continuous surjection T:C_{p}(X) \to C_{p}(Y), where C_{p}(X) denotes the space of all real-valued continuous functions on X endowed with the pointwise convergence topology. We prove that \dim X=0 implies \dim Y = 0. This generalizes a previous theorem \cite[Theorem 3.4]{LLP} for compact metrizable spaces. Also we point out that the function space C_{p}(P) over the pseudo-arc P admits no densely defined linear continuous operator C_{p}(P) \to C_{p}([0,1]) with a dense image.
