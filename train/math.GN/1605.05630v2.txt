We solve a long standing question due to Arhangel'skii by constructing a compact space which has a G_\delta cover with no continuum-sized (G_\delta)-dense subcollection. We also prove that in a countably compact weakly Lindel\"of normal space of countable tightness, every G_\delta cover has a \mathfrak{c}-sized subcollection with a G_\delta-dense union and that in a Lindel\"of space with a base of multiplicity continuum, every G_\delta cover has a continuum sized subcover. We finally apply our results to obtain a bound on the cardinality of homogeneous spaces which refines De La Vega's celebrated theorem on the cardinality of homogeneous compacta of countable tightness.
