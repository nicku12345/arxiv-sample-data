A PV number is an algebraic integer \alpha of degree d \geq 2 all of whose Galois conjugates other than itself have modulus less than 1. Erd\"{o}s \cite{erdos} proved that the Fourier transform \widehat \varphi, of a nonzero compactly supported scalar valued function satisfying the refinement equation \varphi(x) = \frac{|\alpha|}{2}\varphi(\alpha x) + \frac{|\alpha|}{2}\varphi(\alpha x-1) with PV dilation \alpha, does not vanish at infinity so by the Riemann-Lebesgue lemma \varphi is not integrable. Dai, Feng and Wang \cite{daifengwang} extended his result to scalar valued solutions of \varphi(x) = \sum_k a(k) \varphi(\alpha x - \tau(k)) where \tau(k) are integers and a has finite support and sums to |\alpha|. In (\cite{lawton3}, Conjecture 4.2) we conjectured that their result holds under the weaker assumption that \tau has values in the ring of polynomials in \alpha with integer coefficients. This paper formulates a stronger conjecture and provides support for it based on a solenoidal representation of \widehat \varphi, and deep results of Erd\"{o}s and Mahler \cite{erdosmahler};Odoni \cite{odoni} that give lower bounds for the asymptotic density of integers represented by integral binary forms of degree > 2;degree  = 2, respectively. We also construct an integrable vector valued refinable function with PV dilation.
