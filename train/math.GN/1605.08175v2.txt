We study some generalized metric properties of weak topologies when restricted to the unit sphere of some equivalent norm on a Banach space, and their relationships with other geometrical properties of norms. In case of dual Banach space X^*, we prove that there exists a dual norm such that its unit sphere is a Moore space for the weak^*-topology (has a G_\delta-diagonal for the weak^*-topology, respectively) if, and only if, X^* admits an equivalent weak^*-LUR dual norm (rotund dual norm, respectively).
