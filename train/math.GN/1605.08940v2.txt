These notes form the second part of a detailed account of the theory of nilspaces developed by Camarena and Szegedy. Here we focus on nilspaces equipped with a compact topology that is compatible with the cube structure, called compact nilspaces. The material in these notes relies on the first part of our exposition (available as arXiv:1601.03693), and it expands on the third chapter of the paper of Camarena and Szegedy, providing more detailed proofs of their results. To that end we also include several additional results that are implicit in their paper.
