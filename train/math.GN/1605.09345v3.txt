In this paper we consider a semitopological \alpha-bicyclic monoid \mathcal{B}_{\alpha} and prove that it is algebraically isomorphic to a semigroup of all order isomorphisms between the principal upper sets of the ordinal \omega^\alpha. We prove that for every ordinal \alpha for every (a,b)\in \mathcal{B_\alpha} if either a or b is a non-limit ordinal then (a,b) is an isolated point in \mathcal{B}_\alpha. We show that for every ordinal \alpha<\omega+1 every locally compact semigroup topology on \mathcal{B}_{\alpha} is discrete. However, we construct an example of a non-discrete locally compact topology \tau_{lc} on \mathcal{B}_{\omega+1} such that (\mathcal{B}_{\omega+1},\tau_{lc}) is a topological inverse semigroup. This example shows that there is a gap in \cite[Theorem~2.9]{Hogan-1984}, where is stated that for every ordinal \alpha there is only discrete locally compact inverse semigroup topology on \mathcal{B_\alpha}.
