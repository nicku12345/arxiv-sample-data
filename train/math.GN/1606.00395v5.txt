We study feebly compact topologies \tau on the semilattice \left(\exp_n\lambda,\cap\right) such that \left(\exp_n\lambda,\tau\right) is a semitopological semilattice. All compact semilattice T_1-topologies on \exp_n\lambda are described. Also we prove that for an arbitrary positive integer n and an arbitrary infinite cardinal \lambda for a T_1-topology \tau on \exp_n\lambda the following conditions are equivalent: (i) \left(\exp_n\lambda,\tau\right) is a compact topological semilattice; (ii) \left(\exp_n\lambda,\tau\right) is a countably compact topological semilattice; (iii) \left(\exp_n\lambda,\tau\right) is a feebly compact topological semilattice; (iv) \left(\exp_n\lambda,\tau\right) is a compact semitopological semilattice; (v) \left(\exp_n\lambda,\tau\right) is a countably compact semitopological semilattice. We construct a countably pracompact H-closed quasiregular non-semiregular topology \tau_{\operatorname{\textsf{fc}}}^2 such that \left(\exp_2\lambda,\tau_{\operatorname{\textsf{fc}}}^2\right) is a semitopological semilattice with discontinuous semilattice operation and prove that for an arbitrary positive integer n and an arbitrary infinite cardinal \lambda every T_1-semiregular feebly compact semitopological semilattice \exp_n\lambda is a compact topological semilattice.
