The paper deals with Ascoli spaces C_p(X) and C_k(X) over Tychonoff spaces X. The class of Ascoli spaces X, i.e. spaces X for which any compact subset K of C_k(X) is evenly continuous, essentially includes the class of k_{\mathbb R}-spaces. First we prove that if C_p(X) is Ascoli, then it is \kappa-Fr\'echet-Urysohn. If X is cosmic, then C_p(X) is Ascoli iff it is \kappa-Fr'echet-Urysohn. This leads to the following extension of a result of Morishita: If for a \v{C}ech-complete space X the space C_p(X) is Ascoli, then X is scattered. If X is scattered and stratifiable, then C_p(X) is an Ascoli space. Consequently: (a) If X is a complete metrizable space, then C_p(X) is Ascoli iff X is scattered. (b) If X is a \v{C}ech-complete Lindel\"of space, then C_p(X) is Ascoli iff X is scattered iff C_p(X) is Fr\'echet-Urysohn. Moreover, we prove that for a paracompact space X of point-countable type the following conditions are equivalent: (i) X is locally compact. (ii) C_k(X) is a k_{\mathbb R}-space. (iii) C_k(X) is an Ascoli space. The Asoli spaces C_k(X,[0,1]) are also studied.
