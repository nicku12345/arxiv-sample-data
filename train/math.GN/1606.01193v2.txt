For a metric continuum X, we consider the n^{\tiny\textrm{th}}-symmetric product F_{n}(X) defined as the hyperspace of all nonempty subsets of X with at most n points. The homogeneity degree hd(X) of a continuum X is the number of orbits for the action of the group of homeomorphisms of X onto itself. In this paper we determine hd(F_{n}(X)) for every manifold without boundary and n\in \mathbb{N}. We also compute hd(F_{n}[0,1]) for all n\in \mathbb{N}.
