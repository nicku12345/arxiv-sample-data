We characterize topological (and uniform) spaces whose free (locally convex) topological vector spaces have a local \mathfrak G-base. A topological space X has a local \mathfrak G-base if every point x of X has a neighborhood base (U_\alpha)_{\alpha\in\omega^\omega} such that U_\beta\subset U_\alpha for all \alpha\le\beta in \omega^\omega. To construct \mathfrak G-bases in free topological vector spaces, we exploit a new description of the topology of a free topological vector space over a topological (or more generally, uniform) space.
