A topological space X is said to be an Ascoli space if any compact subset K of C_k(X) is evenly continuous. This definition is motivated by the classical Ascoli theorem. We study the k_R-property and the Ascoli property of C_p(\kappa) and C_k(\kappa) over ordinals \kappa. We prove that C_p(\kappa) is always an Ascoli space, while C_p(\kappa) is a k_R-space iff the cofinality of \kappa is countable. In particular, this provides the first C_p-example of an Ascoli space which is not a k_R-space, namely C_p(\omega_1). We show that C_k(\kappa) is Ascoli iff cf(\kappa) is countable iff C_k(\kappa) is metrizable.
