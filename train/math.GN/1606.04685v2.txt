It is shown that the ring of periodic distributions is a coherent ring (with the operations of pointwise addition and convolution) by showing that the isomorphic ring s' of the Fourier coefficients (of sequences of at most polynomial growth) with termwise operations is coherent. Moreover, it is shown that the subring \ell^\infty of s' of all bounded sequences is coherent too, while the subring c of \ell^\infty of all convergent sequences is not coherent. It is also observed that s' is a Hermite ring, but not a projective free ring.
