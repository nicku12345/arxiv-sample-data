We show that for any continuous monotonic fixed-point free automorphism f on a \sigma-compact subgroup G\subset \mathbb R there exists a binary operation +_f such that \langle G, +_f\rangle is a topological group topologically isomorphic to \langle G, +\rangle and f is a shift with respect to +_f. We then show that monotonicity cannot be replaced by the property of being periodic-point free. We explore a few routes leading to generalizations and counterexamples.
