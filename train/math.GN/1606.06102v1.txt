The family of all subcontinua that separate a compact connected n-manifold X (with or without boundary), n\ge 3, is an F_\sigma-absorber in the hyperspace C(X) of nonempty subcontinua of X. If D_2(F_\sigma) is the small Borel class of spaces which are differences of two \sigma-compact sets, then the family of all (n-1)-dimensional continua that separate X is a D_2(F_\sigma)-absorber in C(X). The families of nondegenerate colocally connected or aposyndetic continua in I^n and of at least two-dimensional or decomposable Kelley continua are F_{\sigma\delta}-absorbers in the hyperspace C(I^n) for n\ge 3. The hyperspaces of all weakly infinite-dimensional continua and of C-continua of dimensions at least 2 in a compact connected Hilbert cube manifold X are \Pi ^1_1-absorbers in C(X). The family of all hereditarily infinite-dimensional compacta in the Hilbert cube I^\omega is \Pi ^1_1-complete in 2^{I^\omega}.
