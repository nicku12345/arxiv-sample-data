One partially ordered set, Q, is a Tukey quotient of another, P, denoted P \geq_T Q, if there is a map \phi : P \to Q carrying cofinal sets of P to cofinal sets of Q. Let X be a space and denote by \mathcal{K}(X) the set of compact subsets of X, ordered by inclusion. For certain separable metrizable spaces M, Tukey upper and lower bounds of \mathcal{K}(M) are calculated. Results on invariants of \mathcal{K}(M)'s are deduced. The structure of all \mathcal{K}(M)'s under \le_T is investigated. Particular emphasis is placed on the position of \mathcal{K}(M) when M is: completely metrizable, the rationals \mathbb{Q}, co-analytic or analytic.
