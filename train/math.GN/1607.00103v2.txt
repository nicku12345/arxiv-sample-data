The main result of this article is:   THEOREM. Every homogeneous locally conical connected separable metric space that is not a 1-manifold is strongly n-homogeneous for each n \geq 2 and countable dense homogeneous. Furthermore, countable dense homogeneity can be proven without assuming the space is connected.   This theorem has the following two consequences.   COROLLARY 1. If X is a homogeneous compact suspension, then X is an absolute suspension (i.e., for any two distinct points p and q of X, there is a homeomorphism from X to a suspension that maps p and q to the suspension points).   COROLLARY 2. If there exists a locally conical counterexample X to the Bing-Borsuk Conjecture (i.e., X is a locally conical homogeneous Euclidean neighborhood retract that is not a manifold), then X is strongly n-homogeneous for all n \geq 2 and countable dense homogeneous.
