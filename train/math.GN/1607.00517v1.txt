Extending a result of R. de la Vega, we prove that an infinite homogeneous compactum has cardinality \mathfrak{c} if either it is the union of countably many dense or finitely many arbitrary countably tight subspaces. The question if every infinite homogeneous and \sigma-countably tight compactum has cardinality \mathfrak{c} remains open.   We also show that if an arbitrary product is \sigma-countably tight then all but finitely many of its factors must be countably tight.
