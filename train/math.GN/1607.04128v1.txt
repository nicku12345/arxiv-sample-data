We construct a complete lattice Z such that the binary supremum function \sup:Z\times Z\to Z is discontinuous with respect to the product topology on Z\times Z of the Scott topologies on each copy of Z. In addition, we show that bounded completeness of a complete lattice Z is in general not inherited by the dcpo C(X,Z) of continuous functions from X to Z where X may be any topological space and where on Z the Scott topology is considered.
