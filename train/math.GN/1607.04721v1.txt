We present old and new characterizations of core spaces, alias worldwide web spaces, originally defined by the existence of supercompact neighborhood bases. The patch spaces of core spaces, obtained by joining the original topology with a second topology having the dual specialization order, are the so-called sector spaces, which have good convexity and separation properties and determine the original space. The category of core spaces is shown to be concretely isomorphic to the category of fan spaces; these are certain quasi-ordered spaces having neighborhood bases of so-called fans, obtained by deleting a finite number of principal filters from a principal filter. This approach has useful consequences for domain theory. In fact, endowed with the Scott topology, the continuous domains are nothing but the sober core spaces, and endowed with the Lawson topology, they are the corresponding fan spaces. We generalize the characterization of continuous lattices as meet-continuous lattices with T_2 Lawson topology and extend the Fundamental Theorem of Compact Semilattices to non-complete structures. Finally, we investigate cardinal invariants like density and weight of the involved objects.
