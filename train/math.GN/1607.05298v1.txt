In "Denotational semantics for programming languages, balanced quasi-metrics and fixed points" (International Journal of Computer Mathematics 85 (2008), 623-630), J. Rodr\'{i}guez-L\'{o}pez, S. Romaguera and O. Valero introduced and studied a balanced quasi-metric on any domain of (finite and infinite) words, denoted by q_{b}. In this paper we show that the poset of formal balls associated to q_{b} has the structure of a continuous domain
