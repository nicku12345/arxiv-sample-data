Inspired by the work of J. van Mill we define a new topological type --- lonely points. We show that the question of whether these points exist in \omega^* is equivalent to finding a countable OHI, extremally disconnected, zerodimensional space with a remote weak P-point. We also present methods which allow us to find lonely points in a large subspace of \omega^* and show why known methods do not allow us to construct them in all of \omega^*.
