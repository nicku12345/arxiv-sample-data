The notion of a \delta-generic sequence of P-points is introduced in this paper. It is proved assuming the Continuum Hypothesis that for each \delta < {\omega}_{2}, any \delta-generic sequence of P-points can be extended to an {\omega}_{2}-generic sequence. This shows that the Continuum Hypothesis implies that there is a chain of P-points of length {\mathfrak{c}}^{+} with respect to both Rudin-Keisler and Tukey reducibility. The proofs can be easily adapted to get such a chain of length {\mathfrak{c}}^{+} under a more general hypothesis like Martin's Axiom. These results answer an old question of Andreas Blass.
