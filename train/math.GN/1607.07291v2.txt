In the presence of suitable power spaces, compactness of \mathbf{X} can be characterized as the singleton \{X\} being open in the space \mathcal{O}(\mathbf{X}) of open subsets of \mathbf{X}. Equivalently, this means that universal quantification over a compact space preserves open predicates.   Using the language of represented spaces, one can make sense of notions such as a \Sigma^0_2-subset of the space of \Sigma^0_2-subsets of a given space. This suggests higher-order analogues to compactness: We can, e.g.~, investigate the spaces \mathbf{X} where \{X\} is a \Delta^0_2-subset of the space of \Delta^0_2-subsets of \mathbf{X}. Call this notion \nabla-compactness. As \Delta^0_2 is self-dual, we find that both universal and existential quantifier over \nabla-compact spaces preserve \Delta^0_2 predicates.   Recall that a space is called Noetherian iff every subset is compact. Within the setting of Quasi-Polish spaces, we can fully characterize the \nabla-compact spaces: A Quasi-Polish space is Noetherian iff it is \nabla-compact. Note that the restriction to Quasi-Polish spaces is sufficiently general to include plenty of examples.
