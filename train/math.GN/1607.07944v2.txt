In general, two overlapping Boolean algebras always extend to a common Boolean algebra, but three may not. We prove a new sufficient condition for n overlapping Boolean algebras to have a common extension. Combining this with the set-theoretic technique of long \omega_1-approximation sequences (also known as Davies sequences), we obtain a flexible method of constructing (in ZFC) arbitrarily large Boolean algebras as direct limits of countable Boolean algebras. Along the way, we develop some category theory regarding (co)limits of faces of commutative n-cubes and an n-ary version of the Interpolation Theorem of propositional logic.   Our most elaborate application of the above machinery is a Boolean algebra of size \aleph_n with the n-ary FN but not the (n+1)-ary FN where the n-ary FN is a higher-arity variant of the Freese-Nation property. The Stone dual of the n-ary FN, n-open generation, generalizes Shchepin's concept of openly generated compact spaces.   We also show that, given a Boolean algebra A of size \aleph_\alpha and letting d=min(\alpha+2,\omega), we have A projective iff it has every (<d)-ary FN iff it has a cofinal family of finite subalgebras whose (<d)-cube subdiagrams have a strong injectivity property. From this we deduce purely finitary consequences for the Vietoris hyperspace and symmetric power functors in the category of finite discrete spaces and finite functions.
