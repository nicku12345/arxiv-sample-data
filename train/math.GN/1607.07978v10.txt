Given a partially ordered set P we study properties of topological spaces X admitting a P-base, i.e., an indexed family (U_\alpha)_{\alpha\in P} of subsets of X\times X such that U_\beta\subset U_\alpha for all \alpha\le\beta in P and for every x\in X the family (U_\alpha[x])_{\alpha\in P} of balls U_\alpha[x]=\{y\in X:(x,y)\in U_\alpha\} is a neighborhood base at x. A P-base (U_\alpha)_{\alpha\in P} for X is called locally uniform if the family of entourages (U_\alpha U_\alpha^{-1}U_\alpha)_{\alpha\in P} remains a P-base for X. A topological space is first-countable if and only if it has an \omega-base. By Moore's Metrization Theorem, a topological space is metrizable if and only if it is a T_0-space with a locally uniform \omega-base.   In the paper we shall study topological spaces possessing a (locally uniform) \omega^\omega-base. Our results show that spaces with an \omega^\omega-base share some common properties with first countable spaces, in particular, many known upper bounds on the cardinality of first-countable spaces remain true for countably tight \omega^\omega-based topological spaces. On the other hand, topological spaces with a locally uniform \omega^\omega-base have many properties, typical for generalized metric spaces. Also we study Tychonoff spaces whose universal (pre- or quasi-) uniformity has an \omega^\omega-base and show that such spaces are close to being \sigma-compact.
