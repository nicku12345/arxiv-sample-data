One partially ordered set, Q, is a Tukey quotient of another, P, if there is a map \phi : P \to Q carrying cofinal sets of P to cofinal sets of Q. Two partial orders which are mutual Tukey quotients are said to be Tukey equivalent. Let X be a space and denote by \mathcal{K}(X) the set of compact subsets of X, ordered by inclusion. The principal object of this paper is to analyze the Tukey equivalence classes of \mathcal{K}(S) corresponding to various subspaces S of \omega_1, their Tukey invariants, and hence the Tukey relations between them. It is shown that \omega^\omega is a strict Tukey quotient of \Sigma(\omega^{\omega_1}) and thus we distinguish between two Tukey classes out of Isbell's ten partially ordered sets. The relationships between Tukey equivalence classes of \mathcal{K}(S), where S is a subspace of \omega_1, and \mathcal{K}(M), where M is a separable metrizable space, are revealed. Applications are given to function spaces.
