Our purpose in this article is to prove that the group H({\bf C}) of homeomorphisms of the complex plane {\bf C} is a metric group equipped with the metric induced by uniform convergence of homeomorphisms and their inverses on compacts and the set \left\{ h \in H({\bf C}) : ( \forall z \in {\bf C} )( h(z) \neq z ) \right\}  of fixed point free homeomorphisms of the complex plane is a conjugacy invariant dense G_{\delta } subset of H({\bf C}).
