In previous work by Beer and Levi [8, 9], the authors studied the oscillation \Omega (f,A) of a function f between metric spaces \langle X,d \rangle and \langle Y,\rho \rangle at a nonempty subset A of X, defined so that when A =\{x\}, we get \Omega (f,\{x\}) = \omega (f,x), where \omega (f,x) denotes the classical notion of oscillation of f at the point x \in X. The main purpose of this article is to formulate a general joint continuity result for (f,A) \mapsto \Omega (f,A) valid for continuous functions.
