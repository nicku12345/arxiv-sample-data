With the approaching TOPOSYM'16 (http://www.toposym.cz/programme.php), it is a pleasure to see selection principles gain increasing attention and becoming a standard part of topology and set theory. At least eight of the 28 speakers, and a good number of the contributed lecture speakers, made substantial contributions to this topic in their career. For some of these, SPs constitute the main topic of research in the last few years. This is in accordance with the continuous progress on the topic, some of which reported in this bulletin.
