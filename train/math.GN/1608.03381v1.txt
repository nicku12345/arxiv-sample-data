In this paper we have used the idea of I-convergence of sequences and nets to study certain conditions of convergence in a topological space. It has been shown separately that a class of sequences and a class of nets in a non-empty set X which are respectively called I-convergence class of sequences and I-convergence class of nets satisfying these conditions generate a topology on X. Further we have correlated the classes of I-convergent sequences and nets with respect to these topologies with the given classes which satisfy these conditions.
