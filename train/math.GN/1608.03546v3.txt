It is proved that any countable topological group in which the filter of neighborhoods of the identity element is not rapid contains a discrete set with precisely one nonisolated point. This gives a negative answer to Protasov's question on the existence in ZFC of a countable nondiscrete group in which all discrete subsets are closed. It is also proved that the existence of a countable nondiscrete extremally disconnected group implies the existence of a rapid ultrafilter and, hence, a countable nondiscrete extremally disconnected group cannot be constructed in ZFC.
