We study a relation between three different formulations of theorems on separable determination - one using the concept of rich families, second via the concept of suitable models and third, a new one, suggested in this paper, using the notion of \omega-monotone mappings. In particular, we show that in Banach spaces all those formulations are in a sense equivalent and we give a positive answer to two questions of O. Kalenda and the author. Our results enable us to obtain new statements concerning separable determination of \sigma-porosity (and of similar notions) in the language of rich families; thus, not using any terminology from logic or set theory.   Moreover, we prove that in Asplund spaces, generalized lushness is separably determined.
