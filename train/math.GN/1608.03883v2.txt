For a compact space K we denote by C_w(K) (C_p(K)) the space of continuous real-valued functions on K endowed with the weak (pointwise) topology. In this paper we discuss the following basic question which seems to be open: Let K and L be infinite compact spaces. Can it happen that C_w(K) and C_p(L) are homeomorphic?   M. Krupski proved that the above problem has a negative answer when K=L and K is finite-dimensional and metrizable. We extend this result to the class of finite-dimensional Valdivia compact spaces K.
