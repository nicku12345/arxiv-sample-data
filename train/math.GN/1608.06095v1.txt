Smooth functions f:G\to E from a topological group G to a locally convex space E were considered by Riss (1953), Boseck, Czichowski and Rudolph (1981), Belti\c{t}\u{a} and Nicolae (2015), and others, in varying degrees of generality. The space C^\infty(G,E) of such functions carries a natural topology, the compact-open C^\infty-topology. For topological groups G and H, we show that C^\infty(G\times H,E)\cong C^\infty(G,C^\infty(H,E)) as a locally convex space, whenever both G and H are metrizable or both G and H are locally compact. Likewise, C^k(G, C^l(H,E)) can be identified with a suitable space of functions on G\times H.
