A {\it weak selection} on \mathbb{R} is a function f: [\mathbb{R}]^2 \to \mathbb{R} such that f(\{x,y\}) \in \{x,y\} for each \{x,y\} \in [\mathbb{R}]^2. In this article, we continue with the study (which was initiated in \cite{ag}) of the outer measures \lambda_f on the real line \mathbb{R} defined by weak selections f. One of the main results is to show that CH is equivalent to the existence of a weak selection f for which: \[ \mathcal \lambda_f(A)= \begin{cases} 0 & \text{if |A| \leq \omega,}\\ \infty & \text{otherwise.} \end{cases} \] Some conditions are given for a \sigma-ideal of \mathbb{R} in order to be exactly the family \mathcal{N}_f of \lambda_f-null subsets for some weak selection f. It is shown that there are 2^\mathfrak{c} pairwise distinct ideals on \mathbb{R} of the form \mathcal{N}_f, where f is a weak selection. Also we prove that Martin Axiom implies the existence of a weak selection f such that \mathcal{N}_f is exactly the \sigma-ideal of meager subsets of \mathbb{R}. Finally, we shall study pairs of weak selections which are "almost equal" but they have different families of \lambda_f-measurable sets.
