Towards attaining a better working understanding of fixed points of maps of tree-like continua, Oversteegen and Rogers constructed a tree-like continuum with a fixed-point-free self-map, described explicitly in terms of inverse limits. Specifically, they developed a sequence of trees T_n, n \in \mathbb{N} and maps f_n and g_n from T_{n+1} to T_n for each n, such that the g_n maps induce a fixed-point-free self-map of the inverse limit space \varprojlim (T_n,f_n).   The complexity of the trees and the valences of the maps in their example all grow exponentially with n, making it difficult to visualize and compute with their space and map. We construct another such example, in which the maps f_n and g_n have uniformly bounded valence, and the trees T_n have a simpler structure.
