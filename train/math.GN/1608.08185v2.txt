We extend F{\o}lner's amenability criterion to the realm of general topological groups. Building on this, we show that a topological group G is amenable if and only if its left translation action can be approximated in a uniform manner by amenable actions on the set G. As applications we obtain a topological version of Whyte's geometric solution to the von Neumann problem and provide an affirmative answer to a question posed by Rosendal.
