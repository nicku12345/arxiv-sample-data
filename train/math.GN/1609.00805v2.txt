A space is called linearly H-closed iff any chain cover possesses a dense member. This property lies strictly between feeble compactness and H-closedness. While regular H-closed spaces are compact, there are linearly H-closed spaces which are even collectionwise normal and Fr\'echet-Urysohn. We give examples in other classes, and ask whether there is a first countable normal linearly H-closed non-compact space in ZFC. We show that PFA implies a negative answer if the space is moreover either locally separable or locally compact and locally ccc. Ostaszewski space (built with \diamondsuit) is an example which is even perfectly normal. We also investigate Menger-like properties for the class of od-covers, that is, covers whose members are open and dense.
