A compact graph-like space is a triple (X,V,E) where X is a compact, metrizable space, V \subseteq X is a closed zero-dimensional subset, and E is an index set such that X \setminus V \cong E \times (0,1). New characterizations of compact graph-like spaces are given, connecting them to certain classes of continua, and to standard subspaces of Freudenthal compactifications of locally finite graphs. These are applied to characterize Eulerian graph-like compacta.
