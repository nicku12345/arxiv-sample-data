We present a complete classification of Hausdorff locally compact polycyclic monoids up to a topological isomorphism. A {\em polycyclic monoid} is an inverse monoid with zero, generated by a subset \Lambda such that xx^{-1}=1 for any x\in\Lambda and xy^{-1}=0 for any distinct x,y\in\Lambda. We prove that any non-discrete Hausdorff locally compact topology with continuous shifts on a polycyclic monoid M coincides with the topology of one-point compactification of the discrete space M\setminus\{0\}.
