Since it first emerged in Wijsman's seminal work [29], the Wijsman topology has been intensively studied in the past 50 years. In particular, topological properties of Wijsman hyperspaces, relationships between the Wijsman topology and other hyperspace topologies, and applications of the Wijsman topology in analysis have been explored. However, there are still several fundamental open problems on this topology. In this article, the author gives a brief survey on these problems and some up-to-date partial solutions.
