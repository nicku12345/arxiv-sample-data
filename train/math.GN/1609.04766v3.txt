We construct an essential extension of \mathcal K(\ell_2({\mathfrak{c}})) by \mathcal K(\ell_2), where {\mathfrak{c}} denotes the cardinality of continuum, i.e., a C^*-algebra \mathcal A\subseteq \mathcal B(\ell_2) satisfying the short exact sequence 0\rightarrow \mathcal K(\ell_2)\xrightarrow{\iota} \mathcal A \rightarrow\mathcal K(\ell_2({\mathfrak{c}}))\rightarrow 0, where \iota[\mathcal K(\ell_2)] is an essential ideal of \mathcal A such that the algebra of multipliers \mathcal M(\mathcal A) of \mathcal A is equal to the unitization of \mathcal A. In particular \mathcal A is not stable which sheds light on permanence properties of the stability in the nonseparable setting. Namely, an extension of a nonseparable algebra of compact operators, even by \mathcal K(\ell_2), does not have to be stable.   This construction can be considered as a noncommutative version of Mr\'owka's \Psi-space; a space whose one point compactification equals to its Cech-Stone compactification and is induced by a special uncountable family of almost disjoint subsets of {\mathbb{N}}. The role of the almost disjoint family is played by an almost orthogonal family of projections in \mathcal B(\ell_2), but the almost matrix units corresponding to the matrix units in \mathcal K(\ell_2({\mathfrak{c}})) must be constructed with extra care.   This example may also contribute in the future to our understanding of the semigroups Ext(\mathcal K(\ell_2({\kappa}))) for \omega_1\leq \kappa\leq\mathfrak{c} which are unexplored at the moment.
