Here we have studied the ideas of g*-closed sets, g^tou -sets and Lamda*-closed sets and investigate some of their properties in the spaces of A. D. Alexandroff [1]. We have also studied few separation axioms like T-omega/4,T-3omega/8, T-omega in Alexandroff spaces and have introduced a new separation axiom namely T-5omega/8 axiom in this space.
