A topological space X is called Piotrowski if every quasicontinuous map f:Z\to X from a Baire space Z to X has a continuity point. In this paper we survey known results on Piotrowski spaces and investigate the relation of Piotrowski spaces to strictly fragmentable, Stegall, and game determined spaces. Also we prove that a Piotrowski Tychonoff space X contains a dense (completely) metrizable Baire subspace if and only if X is Baire (Choquet).
