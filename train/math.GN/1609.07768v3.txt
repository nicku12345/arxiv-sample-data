Semitopological interassociates \mathscr{C}_{m,n} of the bicyclic semigroup \mathscr{C}(p,q) are studied. In particular, we show that for arbitrary non-negative integers m, n and every Hausdorff topology \tau on \mathscr{C}_{m,n} such that \left(\mathscr{C}_{m,n},\tau\right) is a semitopological semigroup, is discrete. Also, we prove that if an interassociate of the bicyclic monoid \mathscr{C}_{m,n} is a dense subsemigroup of a Hausdorff semitopological semigroup (S,\cdot) and I=S\setminus\mathscr{C}_{m,n}\neq\varnothing then I is a two-sided ideal of the semigroup S and show that for arbitrary non-negative integers m, n, any Hausdorff locally compact semitopological semigroup \mathscr{C}_{m,n}^0=\mathscr{C}_{m,n}\sqcup\{0\} is either discrete or compact.
