A set A in a finite dimensional Euclidean space is \emph{monovex} if for every two points x,y \in A there is a continuous path within the set that connects x and y and is monotone (nonincreasing or nondecreasing) in each coordinate. We prove that every open monovex set as well as every closed monovex set is contractible, and provide an example of a nonopen and nonclosed monovex set that is not contractible. Our proofs reveal additional properties of monovex sets.
