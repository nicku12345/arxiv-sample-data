A well ordering < of a topological space X is "left-separating" if \{x'\in X: x'< x\} is closed in X for any x in X. A space is "left-separated" if it has a left-separating well-ordering. The left-separating type, ord_l(X), of a left-separated space X is the minimum of the order types of the left-separating well orderings of X.   We prove that   (1) if {\kappa} is a regular cardinal, then for each ordinal {\alpha}<{\kappa}^+ there is a T_2 space X with ord_l(X)={\kappa}\cdot {\alpha};   (2) if {\kappa}={\lambda}^+ and cf({\lambda})={\lambda}>{\omega}, then for each ordinal {\alpha}<{\kappa}^+ there is a 0-dimensional space X with ord_l( X)={\kappa}\cdot {\alpha};   (3) if {\kappa}=2^{\omega} or {\kappa}=\beth_{{\beta}+1}, where cf({\beta})={\omega}, then for each ordinal {\alpha}<{\kappa}^+ there is a locally compact, locally countable, 0-dimensional space X with ord_l( X)={\kappa}\cdot {\alpha}.   The union of two left-separated spaces is not necessarily left-separated. We show, however, that if X is a countably tight space, X=Y\cup Z, ord_l(Y), ord_l(Z)<\omega_1 \cdot \omega, then X is also left-separated and ord_l(X)\le ord_l(Y)+ord_l(Z). We prove that it is consistent that there is a first countable, 0-dimensional space X, which is not left-separated, but there is a c.c.c poset Q such that in the generic extension V^Q we have ord_l(X)=\omega_1 \cdot \omega. However, if X is a topological space and Q is a c.c.c poset such that in in the generic extension V^Q we have ord_l(X)<\omega_1 \cdot \omega then X is left-separated even in V.
