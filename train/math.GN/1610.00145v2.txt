We present several new theorems concerning the first fundamental group of a path connected metric space. Among the results proven are strengthenings of the main theorems of \cite{Sh2} and \cite{CoCo}. A compactness theorem for the fundamental group of a Peano continuum is given. A useful characterization for the shape kernel of a locally path connected space is presented, along with a very succinct proof of the fact that for such a space the Spanier and shape kernel subgroups coincide (see \cite{BF}). We also show that a free decomposition of the fundamental group of a locally path connected Polish space cannot be nonconstructive. Numerous other results and examples illustrating the sharpness of our theorems are provided.
