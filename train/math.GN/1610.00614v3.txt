In [arXiv:1605.02261] Ros\l{}anowski and Shelah asked whether every locally compact non-discrete group has a null but non-meager subgroup, and conversely, whether it is consistent with ZFC that in every locally compact group a meager subgroup is always null. They gave affirmative answers for both questions in the case of the Cantor group and the reals. In this paper we give affirmative answers for the general case.
