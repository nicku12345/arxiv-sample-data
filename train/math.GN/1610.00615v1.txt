Let X be an (n+1)-dimensional manifold, \Delta be a one-dimensional foliation on X, and p: X \to X / \Delta be a quotient map. We will say that a leaf \omega of \Delta is special whenever the space of leaves X / \Delta is not Hausdorff at \omega. We present necessary and sufficient conditions for the map p: X \to X / \Delta to be a locally trivial fibration under assumptions that all leaves of \Delta are non-compact and the family of all special leaves of \Delta is locally finite.
