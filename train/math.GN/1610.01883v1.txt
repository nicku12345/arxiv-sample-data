Our work aims to introduce generalization of soft  \mu -compact soft generalized topological spaces, namely; soft nearly  \mu -compact spaces which are defined over initial universe with a fixed set of parameters. Basic properties and some significant corollaries will be introduced, Moreover, we investigated that a soft nearly  \mu -compact space produces a parametrized family of nearly  \mu -compact spaces. Some counter examples will be established to show that the converse may not be hold.
