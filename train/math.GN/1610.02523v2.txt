A space X is called a k_{R}-space, if X is Tychonoff and the necessary and sufficient condition for a real-valued function f on X to be continuous is that the restriction of f on each compact subset is continuous. In this paper, we mainly discuss the k_{R}-property on the free topological groups, and generalize some well-known results of K. Yamada's in the free topological groups.
