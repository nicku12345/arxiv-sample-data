We prove that any weakly acausal curve \Gamma in the boundary of Anti-de Sitter (2+1)-space is the asymptotic boundary of two spacelike K-surfaces, one of which is past-convex and the other future-convex, for every K\in(-\infty,-1). The curve \Gamma is the graph of a quasisymmetric homeomorphism of the circle if and only if the K-surfaces have bounded principal curvatures. Moreover in this case a uniqueness result holds.   The proofs rely on a well-known correspondence between spacelike surfaces in Anti-de Sitter space and area-preserving diffeomorphisms of the hyperbolic plane. In fact, an important ingredient is a representation formula, which reconstructs a spacelike surface from the associated area-preserving diffeomorphism.   Using this correspondence we then deduce that, for any fixed \theta\in(0,\pi), every quasisymmetric homeomorphism of the circle admits a unique extension which is a \theta-landslide of the hyperbolic plane. These extensions are quasiconformal.
