Let A be an expanding integer matrix with characteristic polynomial f(x)=x^{2}+px+q, and let \mathcal{D}=\{0,1,\dots,|q|-2,|q|+m\}\mathbf{v} be a collinear digit set where m\geqslant 0, {\mathbf v}\in {\mathbb Z}^2. It is well known that there exists a unique self-affine fractal T satisfying AT=T+\mathcal{D}. In this paper, we give a complete characterization on the connected T. That generalizes the previous result of |q|=3.
