This article is a continuation of my former article "On Connectivity Spaces". After some brief historical references relating to the subject, separation spaces and then adjoint notions of connective representation and connective foliation are developed. The connectivity order previously defined only in the finite case is now generalised to all connectivity spaces, and so to connective foliations. Finally, we start the study of some functorial relations between connectivity and diffeological spaces, and we give a characterization of diffeologisable connectivity spaces.
