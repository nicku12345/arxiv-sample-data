Let f and g be scalar-valued, continuous functions on some topological space. We say that g dominates f in the compatibility ordering if g coincides with f on the support of f. We prove that two compact Hausdorff spaces are homeomorphic if and only if there exists a compatibility isomorphism between their families of scalar-valued, continuous functions. We derive the classical theorems of Gelfand-Kolmogorov, Milgram and Kaplansky as easy corollaries to our result as well as a theorem of Jarosz (Bull. Canad. Math. Soc. 1990) thereby building~a common roof for these theorems. Sharp automatic-continuity results for compatibility isomorphisms are also established.
