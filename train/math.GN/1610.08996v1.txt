We give a general closing-off argument in Theorem 2.1 from which several corollaries follow, including (1) if X is a locally compact Hausdorff space then |X|\leq 2^{wL(X)\psi(X)}, and (2) if X is a locally compact power homogeneous Hausdorff space then |X|\leq 2^{wL(X)t(X)}. The first extends the well-known cardinality bound 2^{\psi(X)} for a compactum X in a new direction. As |X|\leq 2^{wL(X)\chi(X)} for a normal space X [3], this enlarges the class of known Tychonoff spaces for which this bound holds. In 2.10 we give a short, direct proof of (1) that does not use 2.1. Yet 2.1 is broad enough to establish results much more general than (1), such as if X is a regular space with a \pi-base \scr{B} such that |B|\leq 2^{wL(X)\chi(X)} for all B\in\scr{B}, then |X|\leq 2^{wL(X)\chi(X)}.   Separately, it is shown that if X is a regular space with a \pi-base whose elements have compact closure, then |X|\leq 2^{wL(X)\psi(X)t(X)}. This partially answers a question from [3] and gives a third, separate proof of (1). We also show that if X is a weakly Lindel\"of, normal, sequential space with \chi(X)\leq 2^{\aleph_0}, then |X|\leq 2^{\aleph_0}.   Result (2) above is a new generalization of the cardinality bound 2^{t(X)} for a power homogeneous compactum X (Arhangel'skii, van Mill, and Ridderbos [2], De la Vega in the homogeneous case [9]). To this end we show that if U\subseteq clD\subseteq X, where X is power homogeneous and U is open, then |U|\leq |D|^{\pi_{\chi}(X)}. This is a strengthening of a result of Ridderbos [18].
