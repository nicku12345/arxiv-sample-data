We introduce the cardinal invariant aL^\prime(X) and show that |X|\leq 2^{aL^\prime(X)\chi(X)} for any Hausdorff space X (a corollary of Theorem 4.4. This invariant has the properties a) aL^\prime(X)=\aleph_0 if X is H-closed, and b) aL(X)\leq aL^\prime(X)\leq aL_c(X). Theorem 4.4 then gives a new improvement of the well-known Hausdorff bound 2^{L(X)\chi(X)} from which it follows that |X|\leq 2^{\psi_c(X)} if X is H-closed (Dow/Porter [5]). The invariant aL^\prime(X) is constructed using convergent open ultrafilters and an operator c:\scr{P}(X)\to\scr{P}(X) with the property clA\subseteq c(A)\subseteq cl_\theta(A) for all A\subseteq X. As a comparison with this open ultrafilter approach, in \S 3 we additionally give a \kappa-filter variation of Hodel's proof [10] of the Dow-Porter result. Finally, for an infinite cardinal \kappa, in \S 5 we introduce \kappawH-closed spaces, \kappa H^\prime-closed spaces, and \kappa H^{\prime\prime}-closed spaces. The first two notions generalize the H-closed property. Key results in this connection are that a) if \kappa is an infinite cardinal and X a \kappawH-closed space with a dense set of isolated points such that \chi(X)\leq\kappa, then |X|\leq 2^{\kappa}, and b) if X is \kappa H^\prime-closed or \kappa H^{\prime\prime}-closed then aL^\prime(X)\leq\kappa. This latter result relates these notions to the invariant aL^\prime(X) and the operator c.
