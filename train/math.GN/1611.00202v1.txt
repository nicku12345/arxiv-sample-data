A space X is of countable type (resp. subcountable type) if every compact subspace F of X is contained in a compact subspace K that is of countable character (resp. countable pseudocharacter) in X. In this paper, we mainly show that: (1) For a functionally Hausdorff space X, the free paratopological group FP(X) and the free abelian paratopological group AP(X) are of countable type if and only if X is discrete; (2) For a functionally Hausdorff space X, if the free abelian paratopological group AP(X) is of subcountable type then X has countable pseudocharacter. Moreover, we also show that, for an arbitrary Hausdorff \mu-space X, if AP_{2}(X) or FP_{2}(X) is locally compact, then X is homeomorphic to the topological sum of a compact space and a discrete space.
