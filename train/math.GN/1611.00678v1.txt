Let X be a paracompact topological space and Y be a Banach space. In this paper, we will characterize the Baire-1 functions f:X\rightarrow{Y} by their graph: namely, we will show that f is a Baire-1 function if and only if its graph gr(f) is the intersection of a sequence (G_n)_{n=1}^{\infty} of open sets in X\times{Y} such that for all x\in{X} and n\in\mathbb{N} the vertical section of G_n is a convex set, whose diameter tends to 0 as n\rightarrow\infty. Afterwards, we will discuss a similar question concerning functions of higher Baire classes and formulate some generalized results in slightly different settings: for example we require the domain to be a metrized Suslin space, while the codomain is a separable Fr\'echet space. Finally, we will characterize the accumulation set of graphs of Baire-2 functions between certain spaces.
