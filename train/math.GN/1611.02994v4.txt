We characterize Ascoli spaces by showing that a Tychonoff space X is Ascoli iff the canonical map from the free locally convex space L(X) over X into C_k\big(C_k(X)\big) is an embedding of locally convex spaces. We prove that an uncountable direct sum of non-trivial locally convex spaces is not Ascoli. If a c_0-barrelled space X is weakly Ascoli, then X is linearly isomorphic to a dense subspace of \mathbb{R}^\Gamma for some \Gamma. Consequently, a Fr\'{e}chet space E is weakly Ascoli iff E=\mathbb{R}^N for some N\leq\omega. If X is a \mu-space and a k-space (for example, metrizable), then C_k(X) is weakly Ascoli iff X is discrete. We prove that the weak* dual space of a Banach space E is Ascoli iff E is finite-dimensional.
