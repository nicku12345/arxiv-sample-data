A topological space X is called strongly \sigma-metrizable if X=\bigcup_{n\in\omega}X_n for an increasing sequence (X_n)_{n\in\omega} of closed metrizable subspaces such that every convergence sequence in X is contained in some X_n. If, in addition, every compact subset of X is contained in some X_n, n\in\omega, then X is called super \sigma-metrizable. Answering a question of V.K.Maslyuchenko and O.I.Filipchuk, we prove that a topological space is strongly \sigma-metrizable if and only if it is super \sigma-metrizable.
