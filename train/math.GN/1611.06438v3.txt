A topological space X is defined to have an \omega^\omega-base if at each point x\in X the space X has a neighborhood base (U_\alpha[x])_{\alpha\in\omega^\omega} such that U_\beta[x]\subset U_\alpha[x] for all \alpha\le\beta in \omega^\omega. We characterize topological and uniform spaces whose free (locally convex) topological vector spaces or free (Abelian or Boolean) topological groups have \omega^\omega-bases.
