In this paper, we shall study categorial properties of the hyperspace of all nontrivial convergent sequences \mathcal{S}_c(X) of a Fre\'ech-Urysohn space X, this hyperspace is equipped with the Vietoris topology. We mainly prove that \mathcal{S}_c(X) is meager whenever X is a crowded space, as a corollary we obtain that if \mathcal{S}_c(X) is Baire, the X has a dense subset of isolated points. As an interesting example \mathcal{S}_c(\omega_1) has the Baire property, where \omega_1 carries the order topology (this answers a question from \cite{sal-yas}). We can give more examples like this one by proving that the Alexandroff duplicated \mathcal{A}(Z) of a space Z satisfies that \mathcal{S}_c(\mathcal{A}(Z)) has the Baire property, whenever Z is a \Sigma-product of completely metrizable spaces and Z is crowded. Also we show that if \mathcal{S}_c(X) is pseudocompact, then X has a relatively countably compact dense subset of isolated points, every finite power of X is pseudocompact, and every G_\delta-point in X must be isolated. We also establish several topological properties of the hyperspace of nontrivial convergent sequences of countable Fre\'ech-Urysohn spaces with only one non-isolated point.
