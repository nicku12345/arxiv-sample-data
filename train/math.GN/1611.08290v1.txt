Let E(X,f) be the Ellis semigroup of a dynamical system (X,f) where X is a compact metric space. We analyze the cardinality of E(X,f) for a compact countable metric space X. A characterization when   E(X,f) and E(X,f)^* = E(X,f) \setminus \{ f^n : n \in \mathbb{N}\} are both finite is given. We show that if the collection of all periods of the periodic points of (X,f) is infinite, then E(X,f) has size 2^{\aleph_0}. It is also proved that if (X,f) has a point with a dense orbit and all elements of E(X,f) are continuous, then |E(X,f)| \leq |X|. For dynamical systems of the form (\omega^2 +1,f), we show that if there is a point with a dense orbit, then all elements of E(\omega^2+1,f) are continuous functions. We present several examples of dynamical systems which have a point with a dense orbit. Such systems provide examples where E(\omega^2+1,f) and \omega^2+1 are homeomorphic but not algebraically homeomorphic, where \omega^2+1 is taken with the usual ordinal addition as semigroup operation.
