We find sufficient conditions under which the product of spaces that have a \pi-tree also has a \pi-tree. These conditions give new examples of spaces with a \pi-tree: every at most countable power of the Sorgenfrey line and every at most countable power of the irrational Sorgenfrey line has a \pi\!-tree. Also we show that if a space has a \pi-tree, then its product with the Baire space, with the Sorgenfrey line, and with the countable power of the Sorgenfrey line also has a \pi-tree.
