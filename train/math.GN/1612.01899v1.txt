We introduce the algebraic entropy for continuous endomorphisms of locally linearly compact vector spaces over a discrete field, as the natural extension of the algebraic entropy for endomorphisms of discrete vector spaces. We show that the main properties of entropy continue to hold in the general context of locally linearly compact vector spaces, in particular we extend the Addition Theorem.
