A topological space X is called almost discretely Lindel\"of if every discrete set D \subset X is included in a Lindel\"of subspace of X. We say that the space X is {\em \mu-sequential} if for every non-closed set A \subset X there is a sequence of length \le \mu in A that converges to a point which is not in A. With the help of a technical theorem that involves elementary submodels, we establish the following two results concerning such spaces.   (1) For every almost discretely Lindel\"of T_3 space X we have |X| \le 2^{\chi(X)}.   (2) If X is a \mu-sequential T_2 space of pseudocharacter \psi(X) \le 2^\mu and for every free set D \subset X we have L(\overline{D}) \le \mu, then |X| \le 2^\mu.   The case \chi(X) = \omega of (1) provides a solution to Problem 4.5 from "I. Juh\'asz, V. Tkachuk, and R. Wilson, Weakly linearly Lindel\"of monotonically normal spaces are Lindel\"of", while the case \mu = \omega of (2) is a partial improvement on the main result of "A.V. Archangel'skii and R.Z. Buzyakova, On some properties of linearly Lindel\"of spaces".
