We introduce matrix algebra of subsets in metric spaces and we apply it to improve results of Yamauchi and Davila regarding Asymptotic Property C. Here is a representative result: Suppose X is an \infty-pseudo-metric space and n\ge 0 is an integer. The asymptotic dimension of X is at most n if and only if for any real number r > 0 and any integer m\ge 1 there is an augmented m\times (n+1)-matrix \mathcal{M}=[\mathcal{B} |\mathcal{A}] (that means \mathcal{B} is a column-matrix and \mathcal{A} is an m\times n-matrix) of subspaces of X of scale-r-dimension 0 such that \mathcal{M}\cdot_\cap \mathcal{M}^T is bigger than or equal to the identity matrix and B(\mathcal{A},r)\cdot_\cap B(\mathcal{A},r)^T is a diagonal matrix.
