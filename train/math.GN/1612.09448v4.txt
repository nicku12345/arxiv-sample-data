We construct a universal action of a countable locally finite group (the Hall's group) on a separable metric space by isometries. This single action contains all actions of all countable locally finite groups on all separable metric spaces as subactions. The main ingredient is the amalgamation of actions by isometries. We show that an equivalence class of this universal action is generic.   We show that the restriction to locally finite groups in our results is necessary as analogous results do not hold for infinite non-locally finite groups.   We discuss the problem also for actions by linear isometries on Banach spaces.
