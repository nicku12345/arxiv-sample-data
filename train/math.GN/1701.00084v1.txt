We prove that if H is a topological group such that all closed subgroups of H are separable, then the product G\times H has the same property for every separable compact group G.   Let c be the cardinality of the continuum. Assuming 2^{\omega_1} = c, we show that there exist:   (1) pseudocompact topological abelian groups G and H such that all closed subgroups of G and H are separable, but the product G\times H contains a closed non-separable \sigma-compact subgroup;   (2) pseudocomplete locally convex vector spaces K and L such that all closed vector subspaces of K and L are separable, but the product K\times L contains a closed non-separable \sigma-compact vector subspace.
