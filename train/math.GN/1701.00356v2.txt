The main purpose of this paper is to study \emph{e-separable spaces}, originally introduced by Kurepa as K_0' spaces; we call a space X e-separable iff X has a dense set which is the union of countably many closed discrete sets. We primarily focus on the behaviour of e-separable spaces under products and the cardinal invariants that are naturally related to e-separable spaces. Our main results show that the statement "there is a product of at most \mathfrak c many e-separable spaces that fails to be e-separable'" is equiconsistent with the existence of a weakly compact cardinal.
