In this paper, we study two classes of planar self-similar fractals T_\varepsilon with a shifting parameter \varepsilon. The first one is a class of self-similar tiles by shifting x-coordinates of some digits. We give a detailed discussion on the disk-likeness ({\it i.e., the property of being a topological disk}) in terms of \varepsilon. We also prove that T_\varepsilon determines a quasi-periodic tiling if and only if \varepsilon is rational. The second one is a class of self-similar sets by shifting diagonal digits. We give a necessary and sufficient condition for T_\varepsilon to be connected.
