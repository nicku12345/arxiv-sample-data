In 1985 M. Smith constructed a nonmetric pseudo-arc; i.e. a Hausdorff homogeneous, hereditary equivalent and hereditary indecomposable continuum. Taking advantage of a decomposition theorem of W. Lewis, he obtained it as a long inverse limit of metric pseudo-arcs with monotone bonding maps. Extending his approach, and the results of Lewis on lifting homeomorphisms, we construct a nonmetric pseudo-circle, and new examples of homogeneous 1-dimensional continua; e.g. a circle and solenoids of nonmetric pseudo-arcs. Among many corollaries we also obtain an analogue of another theorem of Lewis from 1984: any interval map is semi-conjugate to a homeomorphism of the nonmetric pseudo-arc.
