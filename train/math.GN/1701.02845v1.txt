In this paper, we continue to study pairwise (k-semi-)stratifiable bitopological spaces. Some new characterizations of pairwise k-semi-stratifiable bitopological spaces are provided. Relationships between pairwise stratifiable and pairwise k-semi-stratifiable bitopological spaces are further investigated, and an open question recently posed by Li and Lin in \cite{LL} is completely solved. We also study the quasi-pseudo-metrizability of a topological ordered space (X, \tau, \preccurlyeq). It is shown that if (X, \tau, \preccurlyeq) is a ball transitive topological ordered C- and I-space such that \tau is metrizable, then its associated bitopological space (X,\tau^{\flat},\tau^{\natural}) is quasi-pseudo-metrizable. This result provides a partial affirmative answer to a problem in \cite{KM}.
