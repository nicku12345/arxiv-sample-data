Let X be a (data) set. Let K(x,y)>0 be a measure of the affinity between the data points x and y. We prove that K has the structure of a Newtonian potential K(x,y)=\varphi(d(x,y)) with \varphi decreasing and d a quasi-metric on X under two mild conditions on K. The first is that the affinity of each x to itself is infinite and that for x\neq y the affinity is positive and finite. The second is a quantitative transitivity; if the affinity between x and y is larger than \lambda>0 and the affinity of y and z is also larger than \lambda, then the affinity between x and z is larger than \nu(\lambda). The function \nu is concave, increasing, continuous from \mathbb{R}^+ onto \mathbb{R}^+ with \nu(\lambda)<\lambda for every \lambda>0.
