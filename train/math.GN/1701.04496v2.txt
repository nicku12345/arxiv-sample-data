Consider a surface S and let M\subset S. If S\setminus M is not connected, then we say M \emph{separates} S, and we refer to M as a \emph{separating set} of S. If M separates S, and no proper subset of M separates S, then we say M is a \emph{minimal separating set} of S. In this paper we use methods of computational combinatorial topology to classify the minimal separating sets of the orientable surfaces of genus g=2 and g=3. The classification for genus 0 and 1 was done in earlier work, using methods of algebraic topology.
