We study computable topological spaces and semicomputable and computable sets in these spaces. In particular, we investigate conditions under which semicomputable sets are computable. We prove that a semicomputable compact manifold M is computable if its boundary \partial M is computable. We also show how this result combined with certain construction which compactifies a semicomputable set leads to the conclusion that some noncompact semicomputable manifolds in computable metric spaces are computable.
