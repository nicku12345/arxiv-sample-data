Every crowded space X is {\omega}-resolvable in the c.c.c generic extension V^{Fn(|X|,2}) of the ground model. We investigate what we can say about {\lambda}-resolvability in c.c.c-generic extensions for {\lambda}>{\omega}? A topological space is "monotonically \omega_1-resolvable" if there is a function f:X\to {\omega_1} such that \{x\in X: f(x)\ge {\alpha} \}\subset^{dense}X  for each {\alpha}<{\omega_1}. We show that given a T_1 space X the following statements are equivalent:   (1) X is {\omega}_1-resolvable in some c.c.c-generic extension,   (2) X is monotonically \omega_1-resolvable.   (3) X is {\omega}_1-resolvable in the Cohen-generic extension V^{Fn({\omega_1},2)}.   We investigate which spaces are monotonically \omega_1-resolvable. We show that if a topological space X is c.c.c, and {\omega}_1\le \Delta(X)\le |X|<{\omega}_{\omega}, then X is monotonically \omega_1-resolvable. On the other hand, it is also consistent, modulo the existence of a measurable cardinal, that there is a space Y with |Y|=\Delta(Y)=\aleph_\omega which is not monotonically \omega_1-resolvable. The characterization of {\omega_1}-resolvability in c.c.c generic extension raises the following question: is it true that crowded spaces from the ground model are {\omega}-resolvable in V^{Fn({\omega},2)}? We show that (i) if V=L then every crowded c.c.c. space X is {\omega}-resolvable in V^{Fn({\omega},2)}, (ii) if there is no weakly inaccesssible cardinals, then every crowded space X is {\omega}-resolvable in V^{Fn({\omega}_1,2)}. On the other hand, it is also consistent that there is a crowded space X with |X|=\Delta(X)={\omega_1} such that X remains irresolvable after adding a single Cohen real.
