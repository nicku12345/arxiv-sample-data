Let us denote by \Phi(\lambda,\mu) the statement that \mathbb{B}(\lambda) = D(\lambda)^\omega, i.e. the Baire space of weight \lambda, has a coloring with \mu colors such that every homeomorphic copy of the Cantor set \mathbb{C} in \mathbb{B}(\lambda) picks up all the \mu colors.   We call a space X\, {\em \pi-regular} if it is Hausdorff and for every non-empty open set U in X there is a non-empty open set V such that \overline{V} \subset U. We recall that a space X is called {\em feebly compact} if every locally finite collection of open sets in X is finite. A Tychonov space is pseudocompact iff it is feebly compact.   The main result of this paper is the following.   Theorem. Let X be a crowded feebly compact \pi-regular space and \mu be a fixed (finite or infinite) cardinal. If \Phi(\lambda,\mu) holds for all \lambda < \widehat{c}(X) then X is \mu-resolvable, i.e. contains \mu pairwise disjoint dense subsets. (Here \widehat{c}(X) is the smallest cardinal \kappa such that X does not contain \kappa many pairwise disjoint open sets.)   This significantly improves earlier results of van Mill , resp. Ortiz-Castillo and Tomita.
