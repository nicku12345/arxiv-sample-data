We show that the enveloping space X_G of a partial action of a Polish group G on a Polish space X is a standard Borel space, that is to say, there is a topology \tau on X_G such that (X_G, \tau) is Polish and the quotient Borel structure on X_G is equal to Borel(X_G,\tau). To prove this result we show a generalization of a theorem of Burgess about Borel selectors for the orbit equivalence relation induced by a group action and also show that some properties of the Vaught's transform are valid for partial actions of groups.
