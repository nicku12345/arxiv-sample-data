A set A of integers is called total if there is an algorithm which, given an enumeration of A, enumerates the complement of A, and called cototal if there is an algorithm which, given an enumeration of the complement of A, enumerates A. Many variants of totality and cototality have been studied in computability theory. In this note, by an effective forcing construction with strongly infinite dimensional Cantor manifolds, which can be viewed as an effectivization of Zapletal's "half-Cohen" forcing (i.e., the forcing with Henderson compacta), we construct a set of integers whose enumeration degree is cototal, almost total, but neither cylinder-cototal nor telograph-cototal.
