In this paper, the notion of (L,M)-fuzzy convex structures is introduced. It is a generalization of L-convex structures and M-fuzzifying convex structures. In our definition of (L,M)-fuzzy convex structures, each L-fuzzy subset can be regarded as an L-convex set to some degree. The notion of convexity preserving functions is also generalized to lattice-valued case. Moreover, under the framework of (L,M)-fuzzy convex structures, the concepts of quotient structures, substructures and products are presented and their fundamental properties are discussed. Finally, we create a functor \omega from \mathbf{MYCS} to \mathbf{LMCS} and show that there exists an adjunction between \mathbf{MYCS} and \mathbf{LMCS}, where \mathbf{MYCS} and \mathbf{LMCS} denote the category of M-fuzzifying convex structures, and the category of (L,M)-fuzzy convex structures, respectively.
