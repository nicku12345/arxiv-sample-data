We characterize the finite dimensional asymmetric normed spaces which are right bounded and the relation of this property with the natural compactness properties of the unit ball, as compactness and strong compactness. In contrast with some results found in the existing literature, we show that not all right bounded asymmetric norms have compact closed balls. We also prove that there are finite dimensional asymmetric normed spaces that satisfy that the closed unit ball is compact, but not strongly compact, closing in this way an open question on the topology of finite dimensional asymmetric normed spaces. In the positive direction, we will prove that a finite dimensional asymmetric normed space is strongly locally compact if and only if it is right bounded.
