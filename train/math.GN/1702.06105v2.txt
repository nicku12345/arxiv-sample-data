We study feebly compact topologies \tau on the semilattice \left(\exp_n\lambda,\cap\right) such that \left(\exp_n\lambda,\tau\right) is a semitopological semilattice and prove that for any shift-continuous T_1-topology \tau on \exp_n\lambda the following conditions are equivalent: (i)~\tau is countably pracompact; (ii) \tau is feebly compact; (iii) \tau is d-feebly compact; (iv) \left(\exp_n\lambda,\tau\right) is an H-closed space.
