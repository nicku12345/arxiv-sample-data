We define a family of quantum invariants of closed oriented 3-manifolds using spherical multi-fusion categories. The state sum nature of this invariant leads directly to (2+1)-dimensional topological quantum field theories (\text{TQFT}s), which generalize the Turaev-Viro-Barrett-Westbury (\text{TVBW}) \text{TQFT}s from spherical fusion categories. The invariant is given as a state sum over labeled triangulations, which is mostly parallel to, but richer than the \text{TVBW} approach in that here the labels live not only on 1-simplices but also on 0-simplices. It is shown that a multi-fusion category in general cannot be a spherical fusion category in the usual sense. Thus we introduce the concept of a spherical multi-fusion category by imposing a weakened version of sphericity. Besides containing the \text{TVBW} theory, our construction also includes the recent higher gauge theory (2+1)-\text{TQFT}s given by Kapustin and Thorngren, which was not known to have a categorical origin before.
