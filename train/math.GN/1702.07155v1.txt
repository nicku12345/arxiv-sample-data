In this article, we discuss fixed point results for (\varepsilon,\lambda)-uniformly locally contractive self mapping defined on \varepsilon-chainable G-metric type spaces. In particular, we show that under some more general conditions, certain fixed point results already obtained in the literature remain true. Moreover, in the last sections of this paper, we make use of the newly introduced notion of \lambda-sequences to derive new results.
