Following [2], a Tychonoff space X is Ascoli if every compact subset of C_k(X) is equicontinuous. By the classical Ascoli theorem every k-space is Ascoli. We show that a strict (LF)-space E is Ascoli iff E is a Fr\'{e}chet space or E=\phi. We prove that the strong dual E'_\beta of a Montel strict (LF)-space E is an Ascoli space iff one of the following assertions holds: (i) E is a Fr\'{e}chet--Montel space, so E'_\beta is a sequential non-Fr\'{e}chet--Urysohn space, or (ii) E=\phi, so E'_\beta= \mathbb{R}^\omega. Consequently, the space \mathcal{D}(\Omega) of test functions and the space of distributions \mathcal{D}'(\Omega) are not Ascoli that strengthens results of Shirai [20] and Dudley [5], respectively.
