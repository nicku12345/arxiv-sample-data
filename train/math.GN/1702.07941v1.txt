A ballean (or coarse structure) is a set endowed with some family of subsets, the balls, is such a way that balleans with corresponding morphisms can be considered as asymptotic counterparts of uniform topological spaces. For a ballean \mathcal{B} on a set X, the hyperballean \mathcal{B}^{\flat} is a ballean naturally defined on the set X^{\flat} of all bounded subsets of X. We describe all balleans with hyperballeans of bounded geometry and analyze the structure of these hyperballeans.
