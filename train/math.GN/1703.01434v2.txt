We describe the structure of Hausdorff locally compact semitopological 0-bisimple inverse \omega-semigroups with compact maximal subgroups. In particular, we show that a Hausdorff locally compact semitopological 0-bisimple inverse \omega-semigroup with a compact maximal subgroup is either compact or topologically isomorphic to the topological sum of its \mathscr{H}-classes. We describe the structure of Hausdorff locally compact semitopological 0-bisimple inverse \omega-semigroups with a monothetic maximal subgroups. In particular we prove the dichotomy for T_1 locally compact semitopological Reilly semigroup \left(\textbf{B}(\mathbb{Z}_{+},\theta)^0,\tau\right) with adjoined zero and with a non-annihilating homomorphism \theta\colon \mathbb{Z}_{+}\to \mathbb{Z}_{+}: \left(\textbf{B}(\mathbb{Z}_{+},\theta)^0,\tau\right) is either compact or discrete. At the end we discuss on the remainder under the closure of the discrete Reilly semigroup \textbf{B}(\mathbb{Z}_{+},\theta)^0 in a semitopological semigroup.
