Recently S_{b}-metric spaces have been introduced as the generalizations of metric and S-metric spaces. In this paper we investigate some basic properties of this new space. We generalize the classical Banach's contraction principle using the theory of a complete S_{b}-metric space. Also we give an application to linear equation systems using the S_{b}-metric which is generated by a metric.
