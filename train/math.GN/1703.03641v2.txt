Complex networks can be used to represent complex systems which originate in the real world. Here we study a transformation of these complex networks into simplicial complexes, where cliques represent the simplices of the complex. We extend the concept of node centrality to that of simplicial centrality and study several mathematical properties of degree, closeness, betweenness, eigenvector, Katz, and subgraph centrality for simplicial complexes. We study the degree distributions of these centralities at the different levels. We also compare and describe the differences between the centralities at the different levels. Using these centralities we study a method for detecting essential proteins in PPI networks of cells and explain the varying abilities of the centrality measures at the different levels in identifying these essential proteins. The paper is written in a self-contained way, such that it can be used by practitioners of network theory as a basis for further developments.
