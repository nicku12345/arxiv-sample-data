We propose a definition of computable manifold by introducing computability as a structure that we impose to a given topological manifold, just in the same way as differentiability or piecewise linearity are defined for smooth and PL manifolds respectively. Using the framework of computable topology and Type-2 theory of effectivity, we develop computable versions of all the basic concepts needed to define manifolds, like computable atlases and (computably) compatible computable atlases. We prove that given a computable atlas \Phi defined on a set M, we can construct a computable topological space (M, \tau_\Phi, \beta_\Phi, \nu_\Phi), where \tau_\Phi is the topology on M induced by \Phi and that the equivalence class of this computable space characterizes the computable structure determined by \Phi. The concept of computable submanifold is also investigated. We show that any compact computable manifold which satisfies a computable version of the T_2-separation axiom, can be embedded as a computable submanifold of some euclidean space \mathbb{R}^{q}, with a computable embedding, where \mathbb{R}^{q} is equipped with its usual topology and some canonical computable encoding of all open rational balls.
