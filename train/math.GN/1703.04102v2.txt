It is a simple fact that a subgroup generated by a subset A of an abelian group is the direct sum of the cyclic groups \langle a\rangle, a\in A if and only if the set A is independent. In [5] the concept of an independent set in an abelian group was generalized to a topologically independent set in a topological abelian group (these two notions coincide in discrete abelian groups). It was proved that a topological subgroup generated by a subset A of an abelian topological group is the Tychonoff direct sum of the cyclic topological groups \langle a\rangle, a\in A if and only if the set A is topologically independent and absolutely Cauchy summable. Further, it was shown, that the assumption of absolute Cauchy summability of A can not be removed in general in this result. In our paper we show that it can be removed in precompact groups.   In other words, we prove that if A is a subset of a {\em precompact} abelian group, then the topological subgroup generated by A is the Tychonoff direct sum of the topological cyclic subgroups \langle a\rangle, a\in A if and only if A is topologically independent. We show that precompactness can not be replaced by local compactness in this result.
