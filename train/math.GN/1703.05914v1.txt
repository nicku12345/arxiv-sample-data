We describe non-locally connected planar continua via the concepts of fiber and numerical scale.   Given a continuum X\subset\mathbb{C} and x\in\partial X, we show that the set of points y\in \partial X that cannot be separated from x by any finite set C\subset \partial X is a continuum. This continuum is called the {\em modified fiber} F_x^* of X at x. If x\in X^o, we set F^*_x=\{x\}. For x\in X, we show that F_x^*=\{x\} implies that X is locally connected at x. We also give a concrete planar continuum X, which is locally connected at a point x\in X while the fiber F_x^* is not trivial.   The scale \ell^*(X) of non-local connectedness is then the least integer p (or \infty if such an integer does not exist) such that for each x\in X there exist k\le p+1 subcontinua X=N_0\supset N_1\supset N_2\supset\cdots\supset N_{k}=\{x\} such that N_{i} is a fiber of N_{i-1} for 1\le i\le k. If X\subset\mathbb{C} is an unshielded continuum or a continuum whose complement has finitely many components, we obtain that local connectedness of X is equivalent to the statement \ell^*(X)=0.   We discuss the relation of our concepts to the works of Schleicher (1999) and Kiwi (2004). We further define an equivalence relation \sim based on the fibers and show that the quotient space X/\sim is a locally connected continuum. For connected Julia sets of polynomials and more generally for unshielded continua, we obtain that every prime end impression is contained in a fiber. Finally, we apply our results to examples from the literature and construct for each n\ge1 concrete examples of path connected continua X_n with \ell^*(X_n)=n.
