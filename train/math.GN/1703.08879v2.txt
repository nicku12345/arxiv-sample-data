The purpose of this paper is to define for every Polish space X a class of sets, the EBP(X)-sets or the extended Baire property sets, to work out many properties of the EBP(X)-sets and to show their usefulness in analysis. For example, a proper generalization of the Pettis Theorem is proved in this context that furnishes a new automatic continuity result for Polish groups. The name extended Baire property sets is reasonable since EBP(X) contains the Baire property sets BP(X) and it is consistent with ZFC that the containment is proper.
