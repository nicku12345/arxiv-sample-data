In this work we deal with the preservation by G_\delta-refinements. We prove that for \mathrm{SP}-scattered spaces the metacompactness, paralindel\"ofness, metalindel\"ofness and linear lindel\"ofness are preserved by G_\delta-refinements. In this context we also consider some other generalizations of discrete spaces like \omega-scattered and N-scattered. In the final part of this paper we look at a question of Juh\'asz, Soukup, Szentmikl\'ossy and Weiss concerning the tighness of the G_\delta-refinement of a \sigma-product.
