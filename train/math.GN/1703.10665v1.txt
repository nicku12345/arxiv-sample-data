A connected compact subset E of \mathbb{R}^N is said to be a strict Whitney set if there exists a real-valued C^1 function f on \mathbb{R}^N with \nabla f|_E\equiv 0 such that f is constant on no non-empty relatively open subsets of E. We prove that each self-similar arc of Hausdorff dimension s>1 in \mathbb{R}^N is a strict Whitney set with criticality s. We also study a special kind of self-similar arcs, which we call "regular" self-similar arcs. We obtain necessary and sufficient conditions for a regular self-similar arc \Lambda to be a t-quasi-arc, and for the Hausdorff measure function on \Lambda to be a strict Whitney function. We prove that if a regular self-similar arc has "minimal corner angle" \theta_{\min}>0, then it is a 1-quasi-arc and hence its Hausdorff measure function is a strict Whitney function. We provide an example of a one-parameter family of regular self-similar arcs with various features. For some value of the parameter \tau, the Hausdorff measure function of the self-similar arc is a strict Whitney function on the arc, and hence the self-similar arc is an s-quasi-arc, where s is the Hausdorff dimension of the arc. For each t_0\ge 1, there is a value of \tau such that the corresponding self-similar arc is a t-quasi-arc for each t>t_0, but it is not a t_0-quasi-arc. For each t_0>1, there is a value of \tau such that the corresponding self-similar arc is a t_0-quasi-arc, but it is a t-quasi-arc for no t\in [1, t_0).
