For a discrete group G, we use the natural correspondence between ideals in the Boolean algebra  \mathcal{P}_G of subsets of G and closed subsets in the Stone-\check{C}ech compactifi-cation \beta G as a right topological semigroup to introduce and characterize some new ideals in \beta G. We show that if a group G is either countable or Abelian then there are no closed ideals in \beta G maximal in G^*, G^* = \beta G \setminus G, but this statement does not hold for the group S_\kappa of all permutations of an infinite cardinal \kappa. We characterize the minimal closed ideal in \beta G containing all idempotents of G^*.
