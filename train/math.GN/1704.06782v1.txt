A continuum K is a common model for the family {\mathcal K} of continua if every member of {\mathcal K} is a continuous image of K. We show that none of the following classes of spaces has a common model: 1) the class of strongly chaotic hereditarily indecomposable n-dimensional Cantor manifolds, for any given natural number n, 2) the class of strongly chaotic hereditarily indecomposable hereditarily strongly infinite-dimensional Cantor manifolds, 3) the class of strongly chaotic hereditarily indecomposable continua with transfinite dimension (small or large) equal to \alpha, for any given ordinal number \alpha < \omega_{1}.
