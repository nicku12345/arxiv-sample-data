Given a metric space (X,d), we say that a mapping \chi: [X]^{2}\longrightarrow\{0.1\} is an isometric coloring if d(x,y)=d(z,t) implies \chi(\{x,y\})=\chi(\{z,t\}). A free ultrafilter \mathcal{U} on an infinite metric space (X,d) is called metrically Ramsey if, for every isometric coloring \chi of [X]^{2}, there is a member U\in\mathcal{U} such that the set [U]^{2} is \chi-monochrome. We prove that each infinite ultrametric space (X,d) has a countable subset Y such that each free ultrafilter \mathcal{U} on X satisfying Y\in\mathcal{U} is metrically Ramsey. On the other hand, it is an open question whether every metrically Ramsey ultrafilter on the natural numbers \mathbb{N} with the metric |x-y| is a Ramsey ultrafilter. We prove that every metrically Ramsey ultrafilter \mathcal{U} on \mathbb{N} has a member with no arithmetic progression of length 2, and if \mathcal{U} has a thin member then there is a mapping f:\mathbb{N}\longrightarrow\omega  such that f(\mathcal{U}) is a Ramsey ultrafilter.
