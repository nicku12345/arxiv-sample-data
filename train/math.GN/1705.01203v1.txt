It is shown that CH implies the existence of a compact Hausdorff space that is countable dense homogeneous, crowded and does not contain topological copies of the Cantor set. This contrasts with a previous result by the author which says that for any crowded Hausdorff space X of countable \pi-weight, if {}^\omega{X} is countable dense homogeneous, then X must contain a topological copy of the Cantor set.
