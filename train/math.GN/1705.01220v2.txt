We determine the homeomorphism type of the hyperspace of positively curved C^\infty convex bodies in \mathbb R^n, and derive various properties of its quotient by the group of Euclidean isometries. We make a systematic study of hyperspaces of convex bodies that are at least C^1. We show how to destroy the symmetry of a family of convex bodies, and prove that this cannot be done modulo congruence.
