The pinning down number pd(X) of a topological space X is the smallest cardinal \kappa such that for every neighborhood assignment \mathcal{U} on X there is a set of size \kappa that meets every member of \mathcal{U}. Clearly, pd(X) \le d(X) and we call X a pd-example if pd(X) < d(X). We denote by \mathbf{S} the class of all singular cardinals that are not strong limit. It was proved in a paper of Juh\'asz,Soukup and Szentmikl\'ossy (arXiv:1506.00206}) that TFAE:   (1) \mathbf{S} \ne \emptyset;   (2) there is a 0-dimensional T_2 pd-example;   (3) there is a T_2 pd-example.   The aim of this paper is to produce pd-examples with further interesting topological properties like connectivity or being a topological group by presenting several constructions that transform given pd-examples into ones with these additional properties.   We show that \mathbf{S} \ne \emptyset is also equivalent to the existence of a connected and locally connected T_3 pd-example, as well as to the existence of an abelian T_2 topological group pd-example.   However, \mathbf{S} \ne \emptyset in itself is not sufficient to imply the existence of a connected T_{3.5} pd-example. But if there is \mu \in \mathbf{S} with \mu \ge \mathfrak{c} then there is an abelian T_2 topological group (hence T_{3.5}) pd-example which is also arcwise connected and locally arcwise connected. Finally, the same assumption \,\mathbf{S} \setminus \mathfrak{c} \ne \emptyset\, even implies that there is a locally convex topological vector space pd-example.
