In the paper we present various characterizations of chain-compact and chain-finite topological semilattices. A topological semilattice X is called chain-compact (resp. chain-finite) if each closed chain in X is compact (finite). In particular, we prove that a (Hausdorff) T_1-topological semilattice X is chain-finite (chain-compact) if and only if for any closed subsemilattice Z\subset X and any continuous homomorphism h:X\to Y to a (Hausdorff) T_1-topological semilattice Y the image h(X) is closed in Y.
