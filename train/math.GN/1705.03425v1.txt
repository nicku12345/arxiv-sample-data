We provide characterizations of Lie groups as compact-like groups in which all closed zero-dimensional metric (compact) subgroups are discrete. The "compact-like" properties we consider include (local) compactness, (local) omega-boundedness, (local) countable compactness, (local) precompactness, (local) minimality and sequential completeness. Below is a sample of our characterizations:   (i) A topological group is a Lie group if and only if it is locally compact and has no infinite compact metric zero-dimensional subgroups.   (ii) An abelian topological group G is a Lie group if and only if G is locally minimal, locally precompact and all closed metric zero-dimensional subgroups of G are discrete.   (iii) An abelian topological group is a compact Lie group if and only if it is minimal and has no infinite closed metric zero-dimensional subgroups.   (iv) An infinite topological group is a compact Lie group if and only if it is sequentially complete, precompact, locally minimal, contains a non-empty open connected subset and all its compact metric zero-dimensional subgroups are finite.
