In this paper, a new structure is defined on a topological space that equips the space with a concept of distance in order to do that firstly, a generalization of quasi-pseudo-metric space named R.O-metric space is introduced, and some of its basic properties is studied. Afterwards the concept of generalized R.O-metric space is defined .Finally, we establish that every topological space is generalized R.O-metrizable.
