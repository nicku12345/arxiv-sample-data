A well-known theorem of Nash-Williams shows that the collection of locally finite trees under the topological minor relation results in a BQO. Set theoretically, two very natural questions arise: (1) What is the number \lambda of topological types of locally finite trees? (2) What are the possible sizes of an equivalence class of locally finite trees? For (1), clearly, \omega \leq \lambda \leq \mathfrak{c} and Matthiesen refined it to \omega_1 \leq \lambda \leq \mathfrak{c}. Thus, this question becomes non-trivial when the Continuum Hypothesis is not assumed. In this paper we address both questions by showing that - entirely within ZFC - for a large collection of locally finite trees that includes those with countably many rays: the answer for (1) is \lambda = \omega_1, and that for (2) the size of an equivalence class can only be either 1 or \mathfrak{c}.
