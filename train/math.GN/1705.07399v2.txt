Let \kappa be an infinite regular cardinal. We define a topological space X to be T_{\kappa-Borel}-space (resp. a T_{\kappa-BP}-space) if for every x\in X the singleton \{x\} belongs to the smallest \kappa-additive algebra of subsets of X that contains all open sets (and all nowhere dense sets) in X. Each T_1-space is a T_{\kappa-Borel}-space and each T_{\kappa-Borel}-space is a T_0-space. On the other hand, T_{\kappa-BP}-spaces need not be T_0-spaces.   We prove that a topological space X is a T_{\kappa-Borel}-space (resp. a T_{\kappa-BP}-space) if and only if for each point x\in X the singleton \{x\} is the intersection of a closed set and a G_{<\kappa}-set in X (resp. \{x\} is either nowhere dense or a G_{<\kappa}-set in X). Also we present simple examples distinguishing the separation axioms T_{\kappa-Borel} and T_{\kappa-BP} for various infinite cardinals \kappa, and we relate the axioms to several known notions, which results in a quite regular two-dimensional diagram of lower separation axioms.
