Let X be a partially ordered set with the property that each family of order intervals of the form [a,b],[a,\rightarrow ) with the finite intersection property has a nonempty intersection. We show that every directed subset of X has a supremum. Then we apply the above result to prove that if X is a topological space with a partial order \preceq  for which the order intervals are compact, \mathcal{F} a nonempty commutative family of monotone maps from X into X and there exists c\in X such that c\preceq Tc for every T\in \mathcal{F}, then the set of common fixed points of \mathcal{F} is nonempty and has a maximal element. The result, specialized to the case of Banach spaces gives a general fixed point theorem that drops almost all assumptions from the recent results in this area. An application to the theory of integral equations of Urysohn's type is also given.
