Let \mathcal C be a subcategory of the category of topologized semigroups and their partial continuous homomorphisms. An object X of the category {\mathcal C} is called {\mathcal C}-closed if for each morphism f:X\to Y of the category {\mathcal C} the image f(X) is closed in Y. In the paper we detect topological groups which are \mathcal C-closed for the categories \mathcal C whose objects are Hausdorff topological (semi)groups and whose morphisms are isomorphic topological embeddings, injective continuous homomorphisms, continuous homomorphisms, or partial continuous homomorphisms with closed domain.
