We give a consistent example of a zero-dimensional separable metrizable space Z such that every homeomorphism of Z^\omega acts like a permutation of the coordinates almost everywhere. Furthermore, this permutation varies continuously. This shows that a result of Dow and Pearl is sharp, and gives some insight into an open problem of Terada. Our example Z is simply the set of \omega_1 Cohen reals, viewed as a subspace of 2^\omega.
