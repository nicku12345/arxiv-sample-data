We provide a new, unified approach to proving: the Edwards-Walsh cell-like, the Dranishnikov \mathbb{Z}/p, and the Levin \mathbb{Q} resolution theorems. Our techniques will lead to a new resolution theorem which has Levin's \mathbb{Q}-resolution theorem as a corollary. One of the advantages of our methods is that we use very simple extensions in our constructions; indeed, we use no extensions at all for our proof of the Edwards-Walsh cell-like resolution theorem.
