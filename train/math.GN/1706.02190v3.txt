The free topological vector space V(X) over a Tychonoff space X is a pair consisting of a topological vector space V(X) and a continuous map i=i_{X}: X\rightarrow V(X) such that every continuous mapping f from X to a topological vector space E gives rise to a unique continuous linear operator \overline{f}: V(X)\rightarrow E with f=\overline{f}\circ i. In this paper the k-property and countable tightness of free topological vector space over some generalized metric spaces are studied. The characterization of a space X is given such that the free topological vector space V(X) is a k-space or the tightness of V(X) is countable. Furthermore, the characterization of a space X is also provided such that if the fourth level of V(X) has the k-property or is of the countable tightness then V(X) is too.
