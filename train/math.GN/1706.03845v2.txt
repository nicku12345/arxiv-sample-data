We prove two general results concerning spectral sequences of \mathbf{FI}-modules. These results can be used to significantly improve stable ranges in a large portion of the stability theorems for \mathbf{FI}-modules currently in the literature. We work this out in detail for the cohomology of configuration spaces where we prove a linear stable range and the homology of congruence subgroups of general linear groups where we prove a quadratic stable range. Previously, the best stable ranges known in these examples were exponential. Up to an additive constant, our work on congruence subgroups verifies a conjecture of Djament.
