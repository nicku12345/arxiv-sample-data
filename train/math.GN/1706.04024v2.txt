A topology \tau on a set X is called maximal connected if it is connected, but no strictly finer topology \tau^* > \tau is connected. We consider a construction of so-called tree sums of topological spaces, and we show how this construction preserves maximal connectedness and also related properties of strong connectedness and essential connectedness.   We also recall the characterization of finitely generated maximal connected spaces and reformulate it in the language of specialization preorder and graphs, from which it is clear that finitely generated maximal connected spaces are precisely T_\frac{1}{2} tree sums of copies of the Sierpi\'nski space.
