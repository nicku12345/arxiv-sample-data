We prove that if K is a remainder of the Hilbert space (i.e., K is the complement of the Hilbert space in its metrizable compactification) then every non-one-point closed image of K either contains a compact set with no transfinite dimension or contains compact sets of arbitrarily high inductive transfinite dimension ind. We construct also for each natural n a sigma-compact metrizable n-dimensional space whose image under any non-constant closed map has dimension at least n, and analogous examples for the transfinite dimension ind.
