Let \mu be a Borel measure on a compactum X. The main objects in this paper are \sigma-ideals I(dim), J_0(\mu), J_f(\mu) of Borel sets in X that can be covered by countably many compacta which are finite-dimensional, or of \mu-measure null, or of finite \mu-measure, respectively. Answering a question of J. Zapletal, we shall show that for the Hilbert cube, the \sigma-ideal I(dim) is not homogeneous in a strong way. We shall also show that in some natural instances of measures \mu with non-homogeneous \sigma-ideals J_0(\mu) or J_f(\mu), the completions of the quotient Boolean algebras Borel(X)/J_0(\mu) or Borel(X)/J_f(\mu) may be homogeneous.   We discuss the topic in a more general setting, involving calibrated \sigma-ideals.
