A space X is called {\it selectively pseudocompact} if for each sequence (U_{n})_{n\in \mathbb{N}} of pairwise disjoint nonempty open subsets of X there is a sequence (x_{n})_{n\in \mathbb{N}} of points in X such that cl_X(\{x_n : n < \omega\}) \setminus \big(\bigcup_{n < \omega}U_n \big) \neq \emptyset and x_{n}\in U_{n}, for each n < \omega. Countably compact space spaces are selectively pseudocompact and every selectively pseudocompact space is pseudocompact. We show, under the assumption of CH, that for every positive integer k > 2 there exists a topological group whose k-th power is countably compact but its (k+1)-st power is not selectively pseudocompact. This provides a positive answer to a question posed in \cite{gt} in any model of ZFC+CH.
