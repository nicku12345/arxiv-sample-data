A topological group X is defined to have compact exponent if for some number n\in\mathbb N the set \{x^n:x\in X\} has compact closure in X. Any such number n will be called a compact exponent of X. Our principal result states that a complete Abelian topological group X has compact exponent (equal to n\in\mathbb N) if and only if for any injective continuous homomorphism f:X\to Y to a topological group Y and every y\in \bar{f(X)} there exists a positive number k (equal to n) such that y^k\in f(X). This result has many interesting implications: (1) an Abelian topological group is compact if and only if it is complete in each weaker Hausdorff group topology; (2) each minimal Abelian topological group is precompact (this is the famous Prodanov-Stoyanov Theorem); (3) a topological group X is complete and has compact exponent if and only if it is closed in each Hausdorff paratopological group containing X as a topoloical subgroup (this confirms an old conjecture of Banakh and Ravsky).
