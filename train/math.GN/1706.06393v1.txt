Given a nonunital \mathrm{C}^*-algebra A one constructs its corona algebra \mathcal M(A)/A. This is the noncommutative analog of the \v{C}ech-Stone remainder of a topological space. We analyze the two faces of these algebras: the first one is given assuming CH, and the other one arises when Forcing Axioms are assumed. In their first face, corona \mathrm{C}^*-algebras have a large group of automorphisms that includes nondefinable ones. The second face is the Forcing Axiom one; here the automorphism group of a corona \mathrm{C}^*-algebra is as rigid as possible, including only definable elements
