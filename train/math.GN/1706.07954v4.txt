We define a class of so-called thinnable ideals \mathcal{I} on the positive integers which includes several well-known examples, e.g., the collection of sets with zero asymptotic density, sets with zero logarithmic density, and several summable ideals. Given a sequence (x_n) taking values in a separable metric space and a thinnable ideal \mathcal{I}, it is shown that the set of \mathcal{I}-cluster points of (x_n) is equal to the set of \mathcal{I}-cluster points of almost all its subsequences, in the sense of Lebesgue measure. Lastly, we obtain a characterization of ideal convergence, which improves the main result in [Trans. Amer. Math. Soc. 347 (1995), 1811--1819].
