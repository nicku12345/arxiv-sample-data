This paper analyzes the structure of mixed-strategy equilibria for Colonel Blotto games, where the outcome on each battlefield is a polynomial function of the difference between the two players' allocations. This paper severely reduces the set of strategies that needs to be searched to find a Nash equilibrium. It finds that there exists a Nash equilibrium where both players' mixed strategies are discrete distributions, and it places an upper bound on the number of points in the supports of these discrete distributions.
