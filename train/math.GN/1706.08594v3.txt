In this paper we characterise graph inverse semigroups which admit only discrete locally compact semigroup topology. This characterization provides a complete answer on the question of Z. Mesyan, J. D. Mitchell, M. Morayne and Y. H. P\'eresse posed in their paper "Topological graph inverse semigroups".
