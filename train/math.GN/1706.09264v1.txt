We show that for every sequence (n_i), where each n_i is either an integer greater than 1 or is \infty, there exists a simply connected open 3-manifold M with a countable dense set of ends \{e_i\} so that, for every i, the genus of end e_i is equal to n_i. In addition, the genus of the ends not in the dense set is shown to be less than or equal to 2. These simply connected 3-manifolds are constructed as the complements of certain Cantor sets in S^3. The methods used require careful analysis of the genera of ends and new techniques for dealing with infinite genus.
