We use the structure theory of minimal dynamical systems to show that, for a general group \Gamma, a tame, metric, minimal dynamical system (X, \Gamma) has the following structure: \begin{equation*} \xymatrix {& \tilde{X} \ar[dd]_\pi \ar[dl]_\eta & X^* \ar[l]_-{\theta^*} \ar[d]^{\iota} \ar@/^2pc/@{>}^{\pi^*}[dd]\\ X & & Z \ar[d]^\sigma\\ & Y & Y^* \ar[l]^\theta } \end{equation*} Here (i) \tilde{X} is a metric minimal and tame system (ii) \eta is a strongly proximal extension, (iii) Y is a strongly proximal system, (iv) \pi is a point distal and RIM extension with unique section, (v) \theta, \theta^* and \iota are almost one-to-one extensions, and (vi) \sigma is an isometric extension.   When the map \pi is also open this diagram reduces to \begin{equation*} \xymatrix {& \tilde{X} \ar[dl]_\eta \ar[d]^{\iota} \ar@/^2pc/@{>}^\pi[dd]\\ X & Z \ar[d]^\sigma\\ & Y } \end{equation*}   In general the presence of the strongly proximal extension \eta is unavoidable. If the system (X, \Gamma) admits an invariant measure \mu then Y is trivial and X = \tilde{X} is an almost automorphic system; i.e. X \overset{\iota}{\to} Z, where \iota is an almost one-to-one extension and Z is equicontinuous. Moreover, \mu is unique and \iota is a measure theoretical isomorphism \iota : (X,\mu, \Gamma) \to (Z, \lambda, \Gamma), with \lambda the Haar measure on Z. Thus, this is always the case when \Gamma is amenable.
