Given an ideal \mathcal{I} on \omega, we prove that a sequence in a topological space X is \mathcal{I}-convergent if and only if there exists a ``big'' \mathcal{I}-convergent subsequence. Then, we study several properties and show two characterizations of the set of \mathcal{I}-cluster points as classical cluster points of a filters on X and as the smallest closed set containing ``almost all'' the sequence. As a consequence, we obtain that the underlying topology \tau coincides with the topology generated by the pair (\tau,\mathcal{I}).
