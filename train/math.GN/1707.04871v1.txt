We prove upper bounds for the spread, the Lindel\"of number and the weak Lindel\"of number of the G_\delta-topology on a topological space and apply a few of our bounds to give a short proof to a recent result of Juh\'asz and van Mill regarding the cardinality of a \sigma-countably tight homogeneous compactum.
