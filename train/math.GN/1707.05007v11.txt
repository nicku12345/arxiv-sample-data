Knaster continua and solenoids are well-known examples of indecomposable continua whose composants (maximal arcwise-connected subsets) are one-to-one images of lines. We show that essentially all non-trivial one-to-one composant images of (half-)lines are indecomposable. And if f is a one-to-one mapping of [0,\infty) or (-\infty,\infty), then there is an indecomposable continuum of which X:=ran(f) is a composant if and only if f maps all final or initial segments densely and every non-closed sequence of arcs in X has a convergent subsequence in the hyperspace K(X)\cup \{X\}. We also prove the existence of composant-preserving embeddings in Euclidean 3-space. Accompanying the proofs are illustrations and examples.
