This survey article is dedicated to some families of fractals that were introduced and studied during the last decade, more precisely, families of Sierpi\'nski carpets: limit net sets, generalised Sierpi\'nski carpets and labyrinth fractals. We give a unifying approach of these fractals and several of their topological and geometrical properties, by using the framework of planar patterns.
