A classical theorem of Malykhin says that if \{X_\alpha:\alpha\leq\kappa\} is a family of compact spaces such that t(X_\alpha)\leq \kappa, for every \alpha\leq\kappa, then t\left( \prod_{\alpha\leq \kappa} X_\alpha \right)\leq \kappa, where t(X) is the tightness of a space X. In this paper we prove the following counterpart of Malykhin's theorem for functional tightness: Let \{X_\alpha:\alpha<\lambda\} be a family of compact spaces such that t_0(X_\alpha)\leq \kappa for every \alpha<\lambda. If \lambda \leq 2^\kappa or \lambda is less than the first measurable cardinal, then t_0\left( \prod_{\alpha<\lambda} X_\alpha \right)\leq \kappa, where t_0(X) is the functional tightness of a space X. In particular, if there are no measurable cardinals, then the functional tightness is preserved by arbitrarily large products of compacta. Our result answers a question posed by Okunev.
