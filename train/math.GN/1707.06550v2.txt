Let X and M be a topological space and metric space, respectively. If C(X,M) denotes the set of all continuous functions from X to M, we say that a subset Y of X is an \emph{M-interpolation set} if given any function g\in M^Y with relatively compact range in M, there exists a map f\in C(X,M) such that f_{|Y}=g. In this paper, motivated by a result of Bourgain in \cite{Bourgain1977}, we introduce a property, stronger than the mere \emph{non equicontinuity} of a family of continuous functions, that isolates a crucial fact for the existence of interpolation sets in fairly general settings. As a consequence, we establish the existence of I_0 sets in every nonprecompact subset of a abelian locally k_{\omega}-groups. This implies that abelian locally k_{\omega}-groups strongly respects compactness.
