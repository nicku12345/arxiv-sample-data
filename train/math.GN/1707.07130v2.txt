A topology \tau on a monoid S is called {\em shift-continuous} if for every a,b\in S the two-sided shift S\to S, x\mapsto axb, is continuous. For every ordinal \alpha\le \omega, we describe all shift-continuous locally compact Hausdorff topologies on the \alpha-bicyclic monoid \mathcal{B}_{\alpha}. More precisely, we prove that the lattice of shift-continuous locally compact Hausdorff topologies on \mathcal{B}_{\alpha} is anti-isomorphic to the segment of [1,\alpha] of ordinals, endowed with the natural well-order. Also we prove that for each ordinal \alpha the \alpha+1-bicyclic monoid \mathcal{B}_{\alpha+1} is isomorphic to the Bruck extension of the \alpha-bicyclic monoid \mathcal{B}_{\alpha}.
