In relation to Itzkowitz's problem, we show that a \mathfrak c-bounded P-group is balanced if and only if it is functionally balanced. We prove that for an arbitrary P-group, being functionally balanced is equivalent to being strongly functionally balanced. A special focus is given to the uniform free topological group defined over a uniform P-space. In particular, we show that this group is (functionally) balanced precisely when its subsets B_n, consisting of words of length at most n, are all (resp., functionally) balanced.
