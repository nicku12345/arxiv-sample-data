Let Z be a non-compact two-dimensional manifold obtained from a family of open strips \mathbb{R}\times(0,1) with boundary intervals by gluing those strips along their boundary intervals. Every such strip has a foliation into parallel lines \mathbb{R}\times t, t\in(0,1), and boundary intervals, whence we get a foliation \Delta on all of Z. Many types of foliations on surfaces with leaves homeomorphic to the real line have such "striped" structure. That fact was discovered by W. Kaplan (1940-41) for foliations on the plane \mathbb{R}^2 by level-set of pseudo-harmonic functions \mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{R} without singularities.   Previously, the first two authors studied the homotopy type of the group \mathcal{H}(\Delta) of homeomorphisms of Z sending leaves of \Delta onto leaves, and shown that except for two cases the identity path component \mathcal{H}_{0}(\Delta) of \mathcal{H}(\Delta) is contractible. The aim of the present paper is to show that the quotient \mathcal{H}(\Delta)/ \mathcal{H}_{0}(\Delta) can be identified with the group of automorphisms of a certain graph with additional structure encoding the "combinatorics" of gluing.
