An inverse limit of a sequence of covering spaces over a given space X is not, in general, a covering space over X but is still a lifting space, i.e. a Hurewicz fibration with unique path lifting property. Of particular interest are inverse limits of finite coverings (resp. finite regular coverings), which yield fibrations whose fiber is homeomorphic to the Cantor set (resp. profinite topological group). To illustrate the breadth of the theory, we present in this note some curious examples of lifting spaces that cannot be obtained as inverse limits of covering spaces.
