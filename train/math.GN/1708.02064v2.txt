We study feebly compact shift-continuous T_1-topologies on the symmetric inverse semigroup \mathscr{I}_\lambda^n of finite transformations of the rank \leqslant n. For any positive integer n\geqslant2 and any infinite cardinal \lambda a Hausdorff countably pracompact non-compact shift-continuous topology on \mathscr{I}_\lambda^n is constructed. We show that for an arbitrary positive integer n and an arbitrary infinite cardinal \lambda for a T_1-topology \tau on \mathscr{I}_\lambda^n the following conditions are equivalent: (i) \tau is countably pracompact; (ii) \tau is feebly compact; (iii) \tau is d-feebly compact; (iv) \left(\mathscr{I}_\lambda^n,\tau\right) is H-closed; (v) \left(\mathscr{I}_\lambda^n,\tau\right) is \mathbb{N}_{\mathfrak{d}}-compact for the discrete countable space \mathbb{N}_{\mathfrak{d}}; (vi) \left(\mathscr{I}_\lambda^n,\tau\right) is \mathbb{R}-compact; (vii) \left(\mathscr{I}_\lambda^n,\tau\right) is infra H-closed. Also we prove that for an arbitrary positive integer n and an arbitrary infinite cardinal \lambda every shift-continuous semiregular feebly compact T_1-topology \tau on \mathscr{I}_\lambda^n is compact.
