The purpose of this work is to introduce a general class of C_G-simulation functions and obtained some new coincidence and common fixed points results in metric spaces. Some useful examples are presented to illustrate our theorems. Results obtained in this paper extend, generalize and unify some well known fixed and common fixed point results.
