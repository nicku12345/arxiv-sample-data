A space X is selectively sequentially pseudocompact if for every sequence (U_n) of non-empty open subsets of X, one can choose a point x_n in each U_n in such a way that the sequence (x_n) has a convergent subsequence. Let G be a group from one of the following three classes: (i) V-free groups, where V is an arbitrary variety of Abelian groups; (ii) torsion Abelian groups; (iii) torsion-free Abelian groups. Under the Singular Cardinal Hypothesis SCH, we prove that if G admits a pseudocompact group topology, then it can also be equipped with a selectively sequentially pseudocompact group topology. Since selectively sequentially pseudocompact spaces are strongly pseudocompact in the sense of Garc\'ia-Ferreira and Ortiz-Castillo, this provides a strong positive (albeit partial) answer to a question of Garc\'ia-Ferreira and Tomita.
