In this paper we show that polycyclic monoids are universal objects in the class of graph inverse semigroups. In particular, we prove that a graph inverse semigroup G(E) over a directed graph E embeds into the polycyclic monoid \mathcal{P}_{\lambda} where \lambda=|G(E)|. We show that each graph inverse semigroup G(E) admits the coarsest inverse semigroup topology \tau. Moreover, each injective homomorphism from (G(E),\tau) to the (\mathcal{P}_{|G(E)|},\tau) is a topological embedding.
