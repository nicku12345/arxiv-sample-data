Let X be a first countable space which admits a non-trivial convergent sequence and let \mathcal{I} be an analytic P-ideal. First, it is shown that the sets of \mathcal{I}-limit points of all sequences in X are closed if and only if \mathcal{I} is also an F_\sigma-ideal.   Moreover, let (x_n) be a sequence taking values in a Polish space without isolated points. It is known that the set A of its statistical limit points is an F_\sigma-set, the set B of its statistical cluster points is closed, and that the set C of its ordinary limit points is closed, with A\subseteq B\subseteq C. It is proved the sets A and B own some additional relationship: indeed, the set S of isolated points of B is contained also in A. Conversely, if A is an F_\sigma-set, B is a closed set with a subset S of isolated points such that B\setminus S\neq \emptyset is regular closed, and C is a closed set with S\subseteq A\subseteq B\subseteq C, then there exists a sequence (x_n) for which: A is the set of its statistical limit points, B is the set of its statistical cluster points, and C is the set of its ordinary limit points.   Lastly, we discuss topological nature of the set of \mathcal{I}-limit points when \mathcal{I} is neither F_\sigma- nor analytic P-ideal.
