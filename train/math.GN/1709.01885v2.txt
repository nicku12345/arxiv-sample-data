We show that the Cartesian product of the arc and a solenoid has the fupcon property, therefore answering a question raised by Illanes. This combined with Illanes' result implies that the product of a Knaster continuum and a solenoid has the fupcon property, therefore answering a question raised by Bellamy and \L ysko in the affirmative. Finally, we show that a product of two Smith's nonmetric pseudo-arcs has the fupcon property.
