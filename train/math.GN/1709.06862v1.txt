We show in ZFC that the existence of completely separable maximal almost disjoint families of subsets of \omega implies that the modal logic S4.1.2 is complete with respect to the \v{C}ech-Stone compactification of the natural numbers, the space \beta\omega. In the same fashion we prove that the modal logic S4 is complete with respect to the space \omega^*=\beta\omega\setminus\omega. This improves the results of G. Bezhanishvili and J. Harding who prove these theorems under stronger assumptions (\mathfrak{a}=\mathfrak{c}). Our proof is also somewhat simpler.
