We use three seminal approaches in the study of fixed point theory, the so called G-metrics, multidimensional fixed points and partially ordered spaces.   More precisely, we extend known results from the theory of quasi-pseudometric spaces to the G-metric space setting. In particular, we show the existence of n-tuple fixed points (resp. common n-tuple fixed point) for a non-decreasing mapping (resp. a pair of weakly related mappings) in a \phi-ordered G-metric space.
