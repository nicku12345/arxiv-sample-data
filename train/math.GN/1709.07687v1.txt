We establish three major fixed-point theorems for functions satisfying an odd power type contractive condition in G-metric spaces. We first consider the case of a single mapping, followed by that of a triplet of mappings and we conclude by the case of a family of mappings. The results we obtain in this article extend similar ones already present in the literature.
