In this paper, we discuss recent results about generalized metric spaces and fixed point theory. We introduce the notion of \eta-cone metric spaces, give some topological properties and prove some fixed point theorems for contractive type maps on these spaces. In particular we show that theses \eta-cone metric spaces are natural generalizations of both cone metric spaces and metric type spaces.
