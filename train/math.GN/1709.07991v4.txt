For a topological space X, let X_\delta be the space X with G_\delta-topology of X. For an uncountable cardinal \kappa, we prove that the following are equivalent: (1) \kappa is \omega_1-strongly compact. (2) For every compact Hausdorff space X, the Lindel\"of degree of X_\delta is \le \kappa. (3) For every compact Hausdorff space X, the weak Lindel\"of degree of X_\delta is \le \kappa. This shows that the least \omega_1-strongly compact cardinal is the supremum of the Lindel\"of and the weak Lindel\"of degrees of compact Hausdorff spaces with G_\delta-topology. We also prove the least measurable cardinal is the supremum of the extents of compact Hausdorff spaces with G_\delta-topology.   For the square of a Lindel\"of space, using weak G_\delta-topology, we prove that the following are consistent: (1) the least \omega_1-strongly compact cardinal is the supremum of the (weak) Lindel\"of degrees of the squares of regular T_1 Lindel\"of spaces. (2) The least measurable cardinal is the supremum of the extents of the squares of regular T_1 Lindel\"of spaces.
