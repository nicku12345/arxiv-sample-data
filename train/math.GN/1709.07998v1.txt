Motivated by results of Juh\'asz and van Mill in [13], we define the cardinal invariant wt(X), the weak tightness of a topological space X, and show that |X|\leq 2^{L(X)wt(X)\psi(X)} for any Hausdorff space X (Theorem 2.8). As wt(X)\leq t(X) for any space X, this generalizes the well-known cardinal inequality |X|\leq 2^{L(X)t(X)\psi(X)} for Hausdorff spaces (Arhangel{\cprime}ski\u{i}~[1],\v{S}}apirovski\u{i}}~[18]) in a new direction. Theorem 2.8 is generalized further using covers by G_\kappa-sets, where \kappa is a cardinal, to show that if X is a power homogeneous compactum with a countable cover of dense, countably tight subspaces then |X|\leq\mathfrak{c}, the cardinality of the continuum. This extends a result in [13] to the power homogeneous setting.
