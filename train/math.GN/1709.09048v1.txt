Here we have studied the idea of semi Lamda*-closed sets and investigate some of their properties in spaces considered by A. D. Alexandroff [1]. We have introduced some new separation axioms namely semi-Tw/4, , semi-T3w/8, semi-T5w/8, and their inter-relation with semi-T0 and semi-T1. We have shown that under certain conditions these axioms are equivalent.
