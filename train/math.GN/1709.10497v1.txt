Sapirovskii [18] proved that |X|\leq\pi\chi(X)^{c(X)\psi(X)}, for a regular space X. We introduce the \theta-pseudocharacter of a Urysohn space X, denoted by \psi_\theta (X), and prove that the previous inequality holds for Urysohn spaces replacing the bounds on celluarity c(X)\leq\kappa and on pseudocharacter \psi(X)\leq\kappa with a bound on Urysohn cellularity Uc(X)\leq\kappa (which is a weaker conditon because Uc(X)\leq c(X)) and on \theta-pseudocharacter \psi_\theta (X)\leq\kappa respectivly (note that in general \psi(\cdot)\leq\psi_\theta (\cdot) and in the class of regular spaces \psi(\cdot)=\psi_\theta(\cdot)). Further, in [6] the authors generalized the Dissanayake and Willard's inequality: |X|\leq 2^{aL_{c}(X)\chi(X)}, for Hausdorff spaces X [25], in the class of n-Hausdorff spaces and de Groot's result: |X|\leq 2^{hL(X)}, for Hausdorff spaces [11], in the class of T_1 spaces (see Theorems 2.22 and 2.23 in [6]). In this paper we restate Theorem 2.22 in [6] in the class of n-Urysohn spaces and give a variation of Theorem 2.23 in [6] using new cardinal functions, denoted by UW(X), \psi w_\theta(X), \theta\hbox{-}aL(X), h\theta\hbox{-}aL(X), \theta\hbox{-}aL_c(X) and \theta\hbox{-}aL_{\theta}(X). In [5] the authors introduced the Hausdorff point separating weight of a space X denoted by Hpsw(X) and proved a Hausdorff version of Charlesworth's inequality |X|\leq psw(X)^{L(X)\psi(X)} [7]. In this paper, we introduce the Urysohn point separating weight of a space X, denoted by Upsw(X), and prove that |X|\leq Upsw(X)^{\theta\hbox{-}aL_{c}(X)\psi(X)}, for a Urysohn space X.
