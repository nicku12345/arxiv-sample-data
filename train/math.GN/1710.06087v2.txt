We study the relations between a generalization of pseudocompactness, named (\kappa, M)-pseudocompactness, the countably compactness of subspaces of \beta \omega and the pseudocompactness of their hyperspaces. We show, by assuming the existence of \mathfrak c-many selective ultrafilters, that there exists a subspace of \beta \omega that is (\kappa, \omega^*)-pseudocompact for all \kappa<\mathfrak c, but \text{CL}(X) isn't pseudocompact. We prove in ZFC that if \omega\subseteq X\subseteq \beta\omega is such that X is (\mathfrak c, \omega^*)-pseudocompact, then \text{CL}(X) is pseudocompact, and we further explore this relation by replacing \mathfrak c for some small cardinals. We provide an example of a subspace of \beta \omega for which all powers below \mathfrak h are countably compact whose hyperspace is not pseudocompact, we show that if \omega \subseteq X, the pseudocompactness of \text{CL}(X) implies that X is (\kappa, \omega^*)-pseudocompact for all \kappa<\mathfrak h, and provide an example of such an X that is not (\mathfrak b, \omega^*)-pseudocompact.
