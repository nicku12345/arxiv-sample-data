We look at the Bohr topology of maximally almost periodic groups (MAP, for short). Among other results, we investigate when a totally bounded abelian group (G,w) is the Bohr reflection of a locally compact abelian group. Necessary and sufficient conditions are established in terms of the inner properties of w. As an application, an example of a MAP group (G,t) is given such that every closed, metrizable subgroup N of bG with N \cap G = \{0\} preserves compactness but (G,t) does not strongly respects compactness. Thereby, we respond to Questions 4.1 and 4.3 in [comftrigwu].
