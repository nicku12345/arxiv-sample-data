For metric spaces, the doubling property, the uniform disconnectedness, and the uniform perfectness are known as quasi-symmetric invariant properties. The David-Semmes uniformization theorem states that if a compact metric space satisfies all the three properties, then it is quasi-symmetrically equivalent to the middle-third Cantor set. We say that a Cantor metric space is standard if it satisfies all the three properties; otherwise, it is exotic. In this paper, we conclude that for each of exotic types the class of all the conformal gauges of Cantor metric spaces has continuum cardinality. As a byproduct of our study, we state that there exists a Cantor metric space with prescribed Hausdorff dimension and Assouad dimension.
