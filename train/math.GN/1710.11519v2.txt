In this paper we study a class of embeddings of tent inverse limit spaces. We introduce techniques relying on the Milnor-Thurston kneading theory and use them to study sets of accessible points and prime ends of given embeddings. We completely characterize accessible points and prime ends of standard embeddings arising from the Barge-Martin construction of global attractors. In other (non-extendable) embeddings we find phenomena which do not occur in the standard embeddings.
