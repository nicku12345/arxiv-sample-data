One important class of tools in the study of the connections between algebraic and topological structures are the "Banach-Stone type theorems", which describe algebraic isomorphisms of algebras (or groups, lattices, etc.) of functions in terms of homeomorphisms between the underlying topological spaces. Several such theorems have been proven throughout the last century, however not all of them are comparable, and in particular no single one is the strongest. In this article, we describe a general framework which encompasses several of these results, and which allows for new applications related to groupoid algebras, and to groups of circle-valued functions. This is attained by a detailed study of "disjointness relations" on sets of functions, which play a central role (even if not explicitly) in previously-proven Banach-Stone type theorems.
