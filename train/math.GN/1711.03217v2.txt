The main goal of the paper is the full proof of a cardinal inequality for a space with points G_\delta , obtained with the help of a long version of the Menger game. This result, which improves a similar one of Scheepers and Tall, was already established by the authors under the Continuum Hypothesis. The paper is completed by few remarks on a long version of the tightness game.
