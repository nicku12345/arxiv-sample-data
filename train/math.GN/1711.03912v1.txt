We study Zariski-like topologies on a proper class X\varsubsetneqq L of a complete lattice \mathcal{L}=(L,\wedge ,\vee ,0,1). We consider X with the so called classical Zariski topology (X,\tau ^{cl}) and study its topological properties (e.g. the separation axioms, the connectedness, the compactness) and provide sufficient conditions for it to be \textit{spectral}. We say that \mathcal{L} is X\emph{-top} iff% \begin{equation*} \tau :=\{X\backslash V(a)\mid a\in L\},\text{ where }V(a)=\{x\in L\mid a\leq x\} \end{equation*}% is a topology. We study the interplay between the \textit{algebraic properties} of an X-top complete lattice \mathcal{L} and the \textit{% topological properties} of (X,\tau ^{cl})=(X,\tau ). Our results are applied to several spectra which are proper classes of \mathcal{L}% :=LAT(_{R}M) where M is a left module over an arbitrary associative ring % R (e.g. the spectra of prime, coprime, fully prime submodules) of M as well as to several spectra of the dual complete lattice \mathcal{L}^{0} (e.g. the spectra of first, second and fully coprime submodules of M).
