We present a relatively simple inductive proof of the classical Levy-Steinitz Theorem saying that for a sequence (x_n)_{n=1}^\infty in a finite-dimensional Banach space X the set of all sums of rearranged series \sum_{n=1}^\infty x_{\sigma(n)} is an affine subspace of X. This affine subspace is not empty if and only if for any linear functional f:X\to \mathbb R the series \sum_{n=1}^\infty f(x_{\sigma(n)}) is convergent for some permutation \sigma of \mathbb N. This gives an answer to a problem of Vaja Tarieladze, posed in Lviv Scottish Book in September, 2017.   Also we construct a sequence (x_n)_{n=1}^\infty in the torus \mathbb T\times\mathbb T such that the series \sum_{n=1}^\infty x_{\sigma(n)} is divergent for all permutations \sigma of \mathbb N but for any continuous homomorphism f:\mathbb T^2\to\mathbb T to the circle group \mathbb T:=\mathbb R/\mathbb Z the series \sum_{n=1}^\infty f(x_{\sigma_f(n)}) is convergent for some permutation \sigma_f of \mathbb N. This example shows that the second part of Levy-Steinitz Theorem (characterizing sequences with non-empty set of potential sums) does not extend to locally compact Abelian groups.
