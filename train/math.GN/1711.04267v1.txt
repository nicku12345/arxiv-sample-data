We introduce \textcolor{red}{general} new techniques for computing the geometric index of a link L in the interior of a solid torus T. These techniques simplify and unify previous ad hoc methods used to compute the geometric index in specific examples \textcolor{red}{ and allow the simple computation of geometric index for new examples where the index was not previously known}. The geometric index measures the minimum number of times any meridional disc of T must intersect L. It is related to the algebraic index in the sense that adding up signed intersections of an interior simple closed curve C in T with a meridional disc gives \pm the algebraic index of C in T. One key idea is introducing the notion of geometric index for solid chambers of the form B^2\times I in T. After that we prove that if a solid torus can be divided into solid chambers by meridional discs in a specific \textcolor{red}{(and often easy to obtain)} way, then the geometric index can be easily computed.
