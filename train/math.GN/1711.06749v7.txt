The Golomb space \mathbb N_\tau is the set \mathbb N of positive integers endowed with the topology \tau generated by the base consisting of arithmetic progressions \{a+bn\}_{n=0}^\infty with coprime a,b. We prove that the Golomb space \mathbb N_\tau has continuum many continuous self-maps, contains a countable disjoint family of infinite closed connected subsets, the set \Pi of prime numbers is a dense metrizable subspace of \mathbb N_\tau, and each homeomorphism h of \mathbb N_\tau has the following properties: h(1)=1, h(\Pi)=\Pi and \Pi_{h(x)}=h(\Pi_x) for all x\in\mathbb N. Here by \Pi_x we denote the set of prime divisors of x.
