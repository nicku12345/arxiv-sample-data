We study the uniqueness of complete biconservative surfaces in the Euclidean space \mathbb{R}^3, and prove that the only complete biconservative regular surfaces in \mathbb{R}^3 are either CMC or certain surfaces of revolution. In particular, any compact biconservative regular surface in \mathbb{R}^3 is a round sphere.
