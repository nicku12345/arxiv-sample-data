We prove that that the number p of positive eigenvalues of the connection Laplacian L of a finite abstract simplicial complex G matches the number b of even dimensional simplices in G and that the number n of negative eigenvalues matches the number f of odd-dimensional simplices in G. The Euler characteristic X(G) of G therefore can be spectrally described as X(G)=p-n. This is in contrast to the more classical Hodge Laplacian H which acts on the same Hilbert space, where X(G) is not yet known to be accessible from the spectrum of H. Given an ordering of G coming from a build-up as a CW complex, every simplex x in G is now associated to a unique eigenvector of L and the correspondence is computable. The Euler characteristic is now not only the potential energy summing over all g(x,y) with g=L^{-1} but also agrees with a logarithmic energy tr(log(i L)) 2/(i pi) of the spectrum of L. We also give here examples of L-isospectral but non-isomorphic abstract finite simplicial complexes. One example shows that we can not hear the cohomology of the complex.
