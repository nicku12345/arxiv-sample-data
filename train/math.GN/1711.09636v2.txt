P. Alexandroff proved that a locally compact T_2-space has a T_2 one-point compactification (obtained by adding a "point at infinity") if and only if it is non-compact. He also asked for characterizations of spaces which have one-point connectifications. Here, we study one-point connectifications, and in analogy with Alexandroff's theorem, we prove that in the realm of T_i-spaces (i=3\frac{1}{2},4,5) a locally connected space has a one-point connectification if and only if it has no compact component. We extend this theorem to the case i=6 by assuming some set-theoretic assumption, and to the case i=2 by slightly modifying its statement. We further extended the theorem by proving that a locally connected metrizable (resp. paracompact) space has a metrizable (resp. paracompact) one-point connectification if and only if it has no compact component. Contrary to the case of the one-point compactification, a one-point connectification, if exists, may not be unique. We consider the collection of all one-point connectifications of a locally connected locally compact space in the realm of T_i-spaces (i=3\frac{1}{2},4,5). We prove that this collection, naturally partially ordered, is a compact conditionally complete lattice whose order-structure determines the topology of all Stone-Cech remainders of components of the space.
