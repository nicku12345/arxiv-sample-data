In the following, bypassing dynamical systems tools, we propose a simple means of computing the box dimension of the graph of the classical Weierstrass function defined, for any real number~x, by~ {\cal W}(x)=\displaystyle \sum_{n=0}^{+\infty} \lambda^n\,\cos \left ( 2\, \pi\,N_b^n\,x \right)   , where~\lambda and~N_b are two real numbers such that~\mbox{0 <\lambda<1},~\mbox{ N_b\,\in\,\N} and~ \lambda\,N_b > 1 , using a sequence a graphs that approximate the studied one.
