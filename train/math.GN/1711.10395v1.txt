We show that for every d\ge 1, if L_1,\ldots, L_d are linearly ordered compact spaces and there is a continuous surjection \[ L_1\times L_2\times \dots\times L_d\to K_1\times K_2\times\ldots\times K_{d}\times K_{d+1},\] where all the spaces K_i are infinite, then K_i, K_j are metrizable for some 1\le i<j\le d+1. This answers a problem posed by S. Marde\v{s}i\'c.   We present some related results on Boolean algebras not containing free products with too many uncountable factors. In particular, we answer a problem on initial chain algebras that was posed by L. Baur and L. Heindorf.
