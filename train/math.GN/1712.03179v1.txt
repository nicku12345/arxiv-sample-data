For each cardinal \kappa, each natural number n and each simplicial complex K we construct a space \nu^n_\kappa(K) and a map \pi \colon \nu^n_\kappa(K) \to K such that the following conditions are satisfied.   1. \nu^n_\kappa(K) is a complete metric n-dimensional space of weight \kappa.   2. \nu^n_\kappa(K) is an absolute neighborhood extensor in dimension n.   3. \nu^n_\kappa(K) is strongly universal in the class of n-dimensional complete metric spaces of weight~\kappa.   4. \pi is an n-homotopy equivalence.   For \kappa = \omega the constructed spaces are n-dimensional separable N\"obeling manifolds. The constructed spaces have very interesting fractal-like internal structure that allows for easy construction, subdivision, and surgery of brick partitions.
