We provide some properties and characterizations of homologically UV^n-maps and lc^n_G-spaces. We show that there is a parallel between recently introduced by Cauty algebraic ANR's and homologically lc^n_G-metric spaces, and this parallel is similar to the parallel between ordinary ANR's and LC^n-metric spaces. We also show that there is a similarity between the properties of LC^n-spaces and lc^n_G-spaces. Some open questions are raised.
