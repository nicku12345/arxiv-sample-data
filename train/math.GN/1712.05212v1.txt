In this paper we consider a notion of nonmeasurablity with respect to Marczewski and Marczewski-like tree ideals s_0, m_0, l_0, and cl_0. We show that there exists a subset A of the Baire space \omega^\omega which is s-, l-, and m-nonmeasurable, that forms dominating m.e.d. family. We introduce and investigate a notion of \mathbb{T}-Bernstein sets - sets that intersect but does not containt any body of a tree from a given family of trees \mathbb{T}. We also acquire some results on \mathcal{I}-Luzin sets, namely we prove that there are no m_0-, l_0-, and cl_0-Luzin sets and that if \mathfrak{c} is a regular cardinal, then the algebraic sum (considered on the real line \mathbb{R}) of a generalized Luzin set and a generalized Sierpi\'nski set belongs to s_0, m_0, l_0 and cl_0.
