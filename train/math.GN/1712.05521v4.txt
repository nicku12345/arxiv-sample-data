For a Tychonoff space X, denote by \mathfrak{P} the family of topological properties \mathcal{P} of being a convergent sequence or being a compact, sequentially compact, countably compact, pseudocompact and functionally bounded subset of X, respectively. A maximally almost periodic (MAP) group G respects \mathcal{P} if \mathcal{P}(G)=\mathcal{P}(G^+), where G^+ is the group G endowed with the Bohr topology. We study relations between different respecting properties from \mathfrak{P} and show that the respecting convergent sequences (=the Schur property) is the weakest one among the properties of \mathfrak{P}. We characterize respecting properties from \mathfrak{P} in wide classes of MAP topological groups including the class of metrizable MAP abelian groups. Every real locally convex space (lcs) is a quotient space of an lcs with the Schur property, and every locally quasi-convex (lqc) abelian group is a quotient group of an lqc abelian group with the Schur property. It is shown that a reflexive group G has the Schur property or respects compactness iff its dual group G^\wedge is c_0-barrelled or g-barrelled, respectively. We prove that a locally quasi-convex abelian k_\omega-group respects all properties \mathcal{P}\in\mathfrak{P}. As an application of the obtained results we show that (1) the space C_k(X) is a reflexive group for every separable metrizable space X, and (2) a reflexive abelian group of finite exponent is a Mackey group.
