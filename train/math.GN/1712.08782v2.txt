In this paper we make some observations concerning m-metric spaces and point out some discrepancies in the proofs found in the literature. To remedy this, we propose a new topological construction and prove that it is in fact a generalization of a partial metric space. Then, using this construction, we present our main theorem having as its corollaries the fixed point theorems found in previous publications.
