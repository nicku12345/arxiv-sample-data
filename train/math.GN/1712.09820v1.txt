For any ideal \mathcal{P} of closed sets in X, let C_\mathcal{P}(X) be the family of those functions in C(X) whose support lie on \mathcal{P}. Further let C^\mathcal{P}_\infty(X) contain precisely those functions f in C(X) for which for each \epsilon >0, \{x\in X: \lvert f(x)\rvert\geq \epsilon\} is a member of \mathcal{P}. Let \upsilon_{C_{\mathcal{P}}}X stand for the set of all those points p in \beta X at which the stone extension f^* for each f in C_\mathcal{P}(X) is real valued. We show that each realcompact space lying between X and \beta X is of the form \upsilon_{C_\mathcal{P}}X if and only if X is pseudocompact. We find out conditions under which an arbitrary product of spaces of the form locally-\mathcal{P}/ almost locally-\mathcal{P}, becomes a space of the same form. We further show that C_\mathcal{P}(X) is a free ideal ( essential ideal ) of C(X) if and only if C^\mathcal{P}_\infty(X) is a free ideal ( respectively essential ideal ) of C^*(X)+C^\mathcal{P}_\infty(X) when and only when X is locally-\mathcal{P} ( almost locally-\mathcal{P}). We address the problem, when does C_\mathcal{P}(X)/C^\mathcal{P}_{\infty}(X) become identical to the socle of the ring C(X). Finally we observe that the ideals of the form C_\mathcal{P}(X) of C(X) are no other than the z^\circ-ideals of C(X).
