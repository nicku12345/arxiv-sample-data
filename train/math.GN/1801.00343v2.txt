Let x be a sequence taking values in a separable metric space and \mathcal{I} be a generalized density ideal or an F_\sigma-ideal on the positive integers (in particular, \mathcal{I} can be any Erd{\H o}s--Ulam ideal or any summable ideal). It is shown that the collection of subsequences of x which preserve the set of \mathcal{I}-cluster points of x [respectively, \mathcal{I}-limit points] is of second category if and only if the set of \mathcal{I}-cluster points of x [resp., \mathcal{I}-limit points] coincides with the set of ordinary limit points of x; moreover, in this case, it is comeager. In particular, it follows that the collection of subsequences of x which preserve the set of ordinary limit points of x is comeager.
