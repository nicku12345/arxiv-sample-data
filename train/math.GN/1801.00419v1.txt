Let Y and Z be two fixed topological spaces and C(Y,Z) the set of all continuous maps from Y into Z. We construct and study topologies on C(Y,Z) that we call {\cal F}_n(\tau_n)-family-open topologies. Furthermore, we find necessary and sufficient conditions such that these topologies to be splitting and jointly continuous. Finally, we present questions concerning a further study on this area.
