We construct a set-valued invariant \iota\left(X,\xi\right) of pointed coarse spaces \left(X,\xi\right) by using nonstandard analysis. The invariance under coarse equivalence is established. A sufficient condition for the invariant to be of cardinality \leq1 is provided. Miller et al. and subsequent researchers have introduced a similar but standard set-valued coarse invariant \sigma\left(X,\xi\right) of pointed metric spaces \left(X,\xi\right). In order to compare these two invariants, we construct a natural transformation \omega_{\left(X,\xi\right)} from \sigma\left(X,\xi\right) to \iota\left(X,\xi\right). The surjectivity of \omega_{\left(X,\xi\right)} is proved for all proper geodesic spaces \left(X,\xi\right).
