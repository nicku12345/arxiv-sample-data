This chapter is divided into two parts. The first part is a survey of some recent results on nests and the orderability problem. The second part consists of results, partial results and open questions, all viewed in the light of nests. From connected LOTS, to products of LOTS and function spaces, up to an order relation in the Fermat Real Line.
