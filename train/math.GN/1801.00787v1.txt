The motion planning problem is a fundamental problem in robotics, so that every autonomous robot should be able to deal with it. A number of solutions have been proposed and a probabilistic one seems to be quite reasonable. However, here we propose a more adoptive solution that uses fuzzy set theory and we expose this solution next to a sort survey on the recent theory of soft robots, for a future qualitative comparison between the two.
