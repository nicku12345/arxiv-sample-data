In this paper we investigate locally compact semitopological graph inverse semigroups. Our main result is the following: if a directed graph E is strongly connected and contains a finite amount of vertices then a locally compact semitopological graph inverse semigroup G(E) is either compact or discrete. This result generalizes results of Gutik and Bardyla who proved the above dichotomy for locally compact semitopological polycyclic monoids \mathcal{P}_1 and \mathcal{P}_{\lambda}, respectively.
