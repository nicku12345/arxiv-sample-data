It is proved that the Continuum Hypothesis implies that any sequence of rapid P-points of length <{\mathfrak c}^{+} which is increasing with respect to the Rudin-Keisler ordering is bounded above by a rapid P-point. This is an improvement of a result from [Kuzeljevi\'c, Raghavan: A long chain of P-points, arxiv:1607.07188 [math.LO]]. It is also proved that the notion of a \delta-generic sequence is equivalent to an apparently much weaker notion. This allows the central definition used in the construction in [Kuzeljevi\'c, Raghavan: A long chain of P-points, arxiv:1607.07188 [math.LO]] to be considerably simplified.
