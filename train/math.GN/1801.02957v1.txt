We consider the self-affine tiles with collinear digit set defined as follows. Let A,B\in\mathbb{Z} satisfy |A|\leq B\geq 2 and M\in\mathbb{Z}^{2\times2} be an integral matrix with characteristic polynomial x^2+Ax+B. Moreover, let \mathcal{D}=\{0,v,2v,\ldots,(B-1)v\} for some v\in\mathbb{Z}^2 such that v,M v are linearly independent. We are interested in the topological properties of the self-affine tile \mathcal{T} defined by M\mathcal{T}=\bigcup_{d\in\mathcal{D}}(\mathcal{T}+d). Lau and Leung proved that \mathcal{T} is homeomorphic to a closed disk if and only if 2|A|\leq B+2. In particular, \mathcal{T} has no cut point. We prove here that \mathcal{T} has a cut point if and only if 2|A|\geq B+5. For 2|A|-B\in \{3,4\}, the interior of \mathcal{T} is disconnected and the closure of each connected component of the interior of \mathcal{T} is homeomorphic to a closed disk.
