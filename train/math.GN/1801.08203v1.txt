This classification is found by analyzing the action of a normal subgroup of B_3 as hyperbolic isometries. This paper gives an example of an unfaithful specialization of the Burau representation on B_4 that is faithful when restricted to B_3, as well as examples of unfaithful specializations of B_3.
