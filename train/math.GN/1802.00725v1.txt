The hyperspace of all nontrivial convergent sequences in a Hausdorff space X is denoted by \mathcal{S}_c(X). This hyperspace is endowed with the Vietoris topology. In connection with a question and a problem by Garc\'ia-Ferreira, Ortiz-Castillo and Rojas-Hern\'andez, concerning conditions under which \mathcal S_c(X) is pathwise connected, in the current paper we study the latter property and the contractibility of \mathcal{S}_c(X). We present necessary conditions on a space X to obtain the path connectedness of \mathcal{S}_c(X). We also provide some sufficient conditions on a space X to obtain such path connectedness. Further, we characterize the local path connectedness of \mathcal{S}_c(X) in terms of that of X. We prove the contractibility of \mathcal{S}_c(X) for a class of spaces and, finally, we study the connectedness of Whitney blocks and Whitney levels for \mathcal{S}_c(X).
