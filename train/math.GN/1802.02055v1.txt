We prove that for every countable discrete group G, there is a G-flow on \omega^* that has every G-flow of weight \leq\! \aleph_1 as a quotient. It follows that, under the Continuum Hypothesis, there is a universal G-flow of weight \leq\!\mathfrak{c}.   Applying Stone duality, we deduce that, under \mathsf{CH}, there is a trivial automorphism \tau of \mathcal P(\omega)/\mathrm{fin} with every other automorphism embedded in it, which means that every other automorphism of \mathcal P(\omega)/\mathrm{fin} can be written as the restriction of \tau to a suitably chosen subalgebra.
