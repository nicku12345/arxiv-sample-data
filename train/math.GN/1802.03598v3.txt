Let n be any positive integer and \mathscr{I\!\!P\!F}(\mathbb{N}^n) be the semigroup of all order isomorphisms between principal filters of the n-th power of the set of positive integers \mathbb{N} with the product order. We study algebraic properties of the semigroup \mathscr{I\!\!P\!F}(\mathbb{N}^n). In particular, we show that \mathscr{I\!\!P\!F}(\mathbb{N}^n) is a bisimple, E-unitary, F-inverse semigroup, describe Green's relations on \mathscr{I\!\!P\!F}(\mathbb{N}^n) and its maximal subgroups. We show that the semigroup \mathscr{I\!\!P\!F}(\mathbb{N}^n) is isomorphic to the semidirect product of the direct n-th power of the bicyclic monoid {\mathscr{C}}^n(p,q) by the group of permutation \mathscr{S}_n. Also we prove that every non-identity congruence \mathfrak{C} on the semigroup \mathscr{I\!\!P\!F}(\mathbb{N}^n) is group and describe the least group congruence on \mathscr{I\!\!P\!F}(\mathbb{N}^n). We show that every Hausdorff shift-continuous topology on \mathscr{I\!\!P\!F}(\mathbb{N}^n) is discrete and discuss embedding of the semigroup \mathscr{I\!\!P\!F}(\mathbb{N}^n) into compact-like topological semigroups.
