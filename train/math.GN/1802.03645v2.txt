In this survey paper we present results about link diagrams in Seifert manifolds using arrow diagrams, starting with link diagrams in F\times S^1 and N\hat{\times}S^1, where F is an orientable and N an unorientable surface. Reidemeister moves for such arrow diagrams make the study of link invariants possible. Transitions between arrow diagrams and alternative diagrams are presented. We recall results about %the knot group presentation for lens spaces and the Kauffman bracket and HOMFLYPT skein modules of some Seifert manifolds using arrow diagrams, namely lens spaces, a product of a disk with two holes times S^1, \mathbb{R}P^3 \# \mathbb{R}P^3, and prism manifolds. We also present new bases of the Kauffman bracket and HOMFLYPT skein modules of the solid torus and lens spaces.
