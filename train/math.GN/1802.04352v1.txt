We investigate the homogeneity of topological subspaces of separable Hilbert space, akin to the spaces with all points rational or all points irrational, so-called Erd\H{o}s spaces. We provide a non-homogeneous example, that is based on one set of coordinates using, and a rigid example, based on a sequence of coordinate sets.
