We continue algebraization of the set of ultrafilters on a metric spaces initiated in [6]. In particular, we define and study metric counterparts of prime, strongly prime and right cancellable ultrafilters from the Stone-\check{C}ech compactification of a discrete group as a right topological semigroup [3]. Our approach is based on the concept of parallelity introduced in the context of balleans in [4].
