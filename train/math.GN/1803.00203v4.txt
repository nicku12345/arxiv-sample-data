In this paper, we study the topological properties of the subpower Higson corona of proper metric spaces and show that the subpower Higson corona of the half open interval with the usual metric is an indecomposable continuum. Some surjective maps from the Higson type coronas onto the Higson type compactifications of the half open interval are also constructed.
