In this paper, we introduce the \mathcal{F}-metric space concept, which generalizes the metric space notion. We define a natural topology \tau_{\mathcal{F}} in such spaces and we study their topological properties. Moreover, we establish a new version of the Banach contraction principle in the setting of \mathcal{F}-metric spaces. Several examples are presented to illustrate our study.
