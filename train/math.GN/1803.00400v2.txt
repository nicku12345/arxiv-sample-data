We show in detail that every compact countable subset of a metric space is homeomorphic to a countable ordinal number, which extends a result given by Mazurkiewicz and Sierpinski for finite-dimensional Euclidean spaces. In order to achieve this goal, we use Transfinite Induction to construct a specific homeomorphism. In addition, we prove that for all metric space (E,d), the cardinality of the set of all the equivalence classes \mathscr{K}_E, up to homeomorphisms, of compact countable subsets of E is less than or equal to \aleph_1, i.e. |\mathscr{K}_E| \le \aleph_1. We also show that for all cardinal number \kappa smaller than or equal to \aleph_1, there exists a metric space (E_{\kappa}, d_{\kappa}) such that |\mathscr{K}_{E_{\kappa}}|= \kappa.
