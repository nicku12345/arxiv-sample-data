In this paper we introduce the concept of the rectangular metric like spaces, along with its topology and we prove some fixed point theorems under different contraction principles. We introduce the concept of modified metric-like space as well and prove some topological and convergence properties under the symmetric convergence. Some examples are given to illustrate the proven results and enrich the new introduced metric type spaces.
