The aim of this article is to survey ring-theoretic properties of Kasch, the regularity and the injectivity of the ring of real-continuous functions on a topoframe L_{ \tau}, i.e., \mathcal{R}L_\tau. In order to study these properties, the concept of P-spaces and extremally disconnected spaces are extend to topoframes. For a P- topoframe L_{ \tau}, the ring \mathcal{R}L_\tau is \aleph_0-Kasch ring. P- topoframes are characterized in terms of ring-theoretic properties of the regularity and injectivity of the ring of real-continuous functions on a topoframe. It follows from these characterizations that the ring \mathcal{R}L_\tau is regular if and only if it is \aleph_0-selfinjective. For a completely regular topoframe L_\tau, we show that \mathcal{R}L_\tau is a Bear ring if and only if it is a CS-ring if and only if L_\tau is extremally disconnected and also prove that it is selfinjective ring if and only if L_{ \tau} is an extremally disconnected P-topoframe.
