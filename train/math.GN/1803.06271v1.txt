Let  M (X) be the ring of all real measurable functions on a measurable space (X, \mathscr{A}). In this article, we show that every ideal of M(X) is a Z^{\circ}-ideal. Also, we give several characterizations of maximal ideals of M(X), mostly in terms of certain lattice-theoretic properties of \mathscr{A}. The notion of T-measurable space is introduced. Next, we show that for every measurable space (X,\mathscr{A}) there exists a T-measurable space (Y,\mathscr{A}^{\prime}) such that M(X)\cong M(Y) as rings. The notion of compact measurable space is introduced. Next, we prove that if (X, \mathscr{A}) and (Y, \mathfrak{M^{\prime}}) are two compact T-measurable spaces, then X\cong Y as measurable spaces if and only if M(X)\cong M (Y) as rings.
