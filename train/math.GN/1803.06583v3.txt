We study topological groups G for which the universal minimal G-system M(G), or the universal irreducible affine G-system IA(G) are tame. We call such groups intrinsically tame and convexly intrinsically tame. These notions are generalized versions of extreme amenability and amenability, respectively. When M(G), as a G-system, admits a circular order we say that G is intrinsically circularly ordered. This implies that G is intrinsically tame. We show that for every circularly ultrahomogeneous action G \curvearrowright X on a circularly ordered set X the topological group G, in its pointwise convergence topology, is intrinsically circularly ordered. This result is a "circular" analog of Pestov's result about the extremal amenability of ultrahomogeneous actions on linearly ordered sets by linear order preserving transformations. In the case where X is countable, the corresponding Polish group of circular automorphisms G admits a concrete description. Using the Kechris-Pestov-Todorcevic construction we show that M(G) is a circularly ordered compact space obtained by splitting the rational points on the circle. We show also that G is Roelcke precompact, satisfies Kazhdan's property T (using results of Evans-Tsankov) and has the automatic continuity property (using results of Rosendal-Solecki).
