Generalizing Christensen's notion of a Haar-null set and Darji's notion of a Haar-meager set, we introduce and study the notion of a Haar-\mathcal I set in a Polish group. Here \mathcal I is an ideal of subsets of some compact metrizable space K. A Borel subset B\subset X of a Polish group X is called Haar-\mathcal I if there exists a continuous map f:K\to X such that f^{-1}(B+x)\in\mathcal I for all x\in X. Moreover, B is generically Haar-\mathcal I if the set of witness functions \{f\in C(K,X):\forall x\in X\;\;f^{-1}(B+x)\in\mathcal I\} is comeager in the function space C(K,X). We study (generically) Haar-\mathcal I sets in Polish groups for many concrete and abstract ideals \mathcal I, and construct the corresponding distinguishing examples. We prove some results on Borel hull of Haar-\mathcal I sets, generalizing results of Solecki, Elekes, Vidny\'anszky, Dole\v{z}al, Vlas\v{a}k on Borel hulls of Haar-null and Haar-meager sets. Also we establish various Steinhaus properties of the families of (generically) Haar-\mathcal I sets in Polish groups for various ideals \mathcal I.
