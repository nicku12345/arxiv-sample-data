In this paper, we introduce the notion of \mathcal{M}-convergence and \mathcal{MN}-convergence structures in posets, which, in some sense, generalise the well-known Scott-convergence and order-convergence structures. As results, we give a necessary and sufficient conditions for each generalised convergence structures being topological. These results then imply the following two well-established results: (1) The Scott-convergence structure in a poset P is topological if and only if P is continuous, and (2) The order-convergence structure in a poset P is topological if and only if P is \mathcal{R}^*-doubly continuous.
