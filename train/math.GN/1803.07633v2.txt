For a Tychonoff space X and a family \lambda of subsets of X, we denote by C_{\lambda}(X) the space of all real-valued continuous functions on X with the set-open topology. In this paper, we study the Menger and projective Menger properties of a Hausdorff space C_{\lambda}(X). Our main results state that if \lambda is a \pi-network of X then (1) C_{\lambda}(X) is Menger space if and only if it is \sigma-compact, if Y is a dense subset of X then (2) C_{p}(Y\vert X) is projective Menger space if and only if it is \sigma-pseudocompact.
