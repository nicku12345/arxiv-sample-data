The path component space of a topological space X is the quotient space \pi_0(X) whose points are the path components of X. We show that every Tychonoff space X is the path-component space of a Tychonoff space Y of weight w(Y)=w(X) such that the natural quotient map Y\to \pi_0(Y)=X is a perfect map. Hence, many topological properties of X transfer to Y. We apply this result to construct a compact space X\subset \mathbb{R}^3 for which the fundamental group \pi_1(X,x_0) is an uncountable, cosmic, k_{\omega}-topological group but for which the canonical homomorphism \psi:\pi_1(X,x_0)\to \check{\pi}_1(X,x_0) to the first shape homotopy group is trivial.
