This paper concerns the local connectedness of components of self-similar sets. Given an equal partition of the unit square into n*n small squares, we may choose arbitrarily two or more of them and form an iterated function system. The attractor F resulted from this IFS is called a fractal square. We prove that every component of F is locally connected. The same result for three-dimensional analogues of F does not hold.
