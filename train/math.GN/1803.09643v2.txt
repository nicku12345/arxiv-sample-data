The class of LOTS (linearly ordered topological spaces, i.e. spaces equipped with a topology generated by a linear order) contains many important spaces, like the set of real numbers, the set of rational numbers and the ordinals. Such spaces have rich topological properties, which are not necessarily hereditary. The Orderability Problem, a very important question on whether a topological space admits a linear order which generates a topology equal to the topology of the space, was given a general solution by J. van Dalen and E. Wattel, in 1973. In this article we first investigate the role of the interval topology in van Dalen's and Wattel's characterization of LOTS, and we then examine ways to extend this model to transitive relations that are not necessarily linear orders.
