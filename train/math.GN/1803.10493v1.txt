Let X be a locally compact topological space, (Y,d) be a boundedly compact metric space and LB(X,Y) be the space of all locally bounded functions from X to Y. We characterize compact sets in LB(X,Y) equipped with the topology of uniform convergence on compacta. From our results we obtain the following interesting facts for X compact:   \bullet If (f_n)_n is a sequence of uniformly bounded finitely equicontinuous functions of Baire class \alpha from X to \Bbb R, then there is a uniformly convergent subsequence (f_{n_k})_k;   \bullet If (f_n)_n is a sequence of uniformly bounded finitely equicontinuous lower (upper) semicontinuous functions from X to \Bbb R, then there is a uniformly convergent subsequence (f_{n_k})_k;   \bullet If (f_n)_n is a sequence of uniformly bounded finitely equicontinuous quasicontinuous functions from X to Y, then there is a uniformly convergent subsequence (f_{n_k})_k.
