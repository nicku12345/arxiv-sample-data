A coarse group is a group endowed with a coarse structure so that the group multiplication and inversion are coarse mappings. Let (X, \mathcal{E}) be a coarse space and let \mathfrak{M} be a variety of groups different from the variety of singletons. We prove that there is a coarse group F_{\mathfrak{M}} (X, \mathcal{E})\in \mathfrak{M} such that (X, \mathcal{E})  is a subspace of F_{\mathfrak{M}} (X, \mathcal{E}), X generates F_{\mathfrak{M}} (X, \mathcal{E}) and every coarse mapping (X, \mathcal{E}) \longrightarrow (G, \mathcal{E}^{\prime})  where G\in\mathfrak{M}, (G, \mathcal{E}^{\prime})  is a coarse group, can be extended to coarse homomorphism F_{\mathfrak{M}} (X, \mathcal{E})\longrightarrow (G, \mathcal{E}^{\prime}) . If \mathfrak{M} is the variety of all groups, the groups F_{\mathfrak{M}} (X, \mathcal{E}) are asymptotic counterparts of Markov free topological groups over Tikhonov spaces.
