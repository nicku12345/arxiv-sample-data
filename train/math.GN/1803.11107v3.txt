In the present paper we investigate the class of compact trees, endowed with the coarse wedge topology, in the area of non-separable Banach spaces. We describe Valdivia compact trees in terms of inner structures and we characterize the space of continuous functions on them. We prove that all compact trees have the property (M). Finally we prove that the space of continuous functions on an arbitrary tree with height less than \omega_1\cdot\omega_0 is Plichko.
