Recently Au\ss enhofer and the author independently have shown that the free abelian topological group A(\mathbf{s}) over a convergent sequence \mathbf{s} does not admit the strongest compatible locally quasi-convex group topology that gives the first example of a locally quasi-convex abelian group without a Mackey group topology. In this note we considerably extend this example by showing that the free abelian topological group A(X) over a non-discrete zero-dimensional metrizable space X does not have a Mackey group topology. In particular, for every countable non-discrete metrizable space X, the group A(X) does not have a Mackey group topology.
