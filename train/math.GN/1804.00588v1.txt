We show that an arbitrary infinite graph G can be compactified by its ends plus its critical vertex sets, where a finite set X of vertices of an infinite graph is critical if its deletion leaves some infinitely many components each with neighbourhood precisely equal to X.   We further provide a concrete separation system whose \aleph_0-tangles are precisely the ends plus critical vertex sets. Our tangle compactification \vert G\vert_{\Gamma} is a quotient of Diestel's (denoted by \vert G\vert_{\Theta}), and both use tangles to compactify a graph in much the same way as the ends of a locally finite and connected graph compactify it in its Freudenthal compactification.   Finally, generalising both Diestel's construction of \vert G\vert_{\Theta} and our construction of \vert G\vert_{\Gamma}, we show that G can be compactified by every inverse limit of compactifications of the sets of components obtained by deleting a finite set of vertices. Diestel's \vert G\vert_{\Theta} is the finest such compactification, and our \vert G\vert_{\Gamma} is the coarsest one. Both coincide if and only if all tangles are ends. This answers two questions of Diestel.
