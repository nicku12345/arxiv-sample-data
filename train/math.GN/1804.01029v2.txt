Given a topological group  G  and a Hausdorff topological group  A  on which  G  acts continuously and compatibly with the group operation of  A , we study the set of continuous cocycles of  G  with value in  A . This set is a function space and can be endowed with several topologies. By imposing a suitable function space topology on the set of cocycles of  G  with value in  A , we propose a topological study of this set, and we prove, as our first main result, that if  A  is a compact group having a presentation as an inverse limit of compact and Hausdorff topological groups  A_{r} , for  r  in a directed poset  R , on which  G  acts continuously and compatibly with the group operation of  A_{r}  and equivariantly with respect to the transition maps, then one has a natural identification between the first nonabelian cohomology set of  G  with coefficients in the inverse limit  A  and the inverse limit of first nonabelian cohomology sets of  G  with coefficients in  A_{r} . Furthermore, we prove, as our second main result, that if  G  is compact and Hausdorff, and  A  is abelian - therefore one can define cohomology groups for all  n\geq1  - then under a certain condition on  A_{r}  one has a natural identification between cohomology group with coefficients in the inverse limit  A  and the inverse limit of cohomology groups with coefficients in  A_{r} , for all  n\geq1 .
