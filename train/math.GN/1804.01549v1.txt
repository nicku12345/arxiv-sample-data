An r-skeleton on a compact space is a family of continuous retractions having certain rich properties. The r-skeletons have been used to characterized the Valdivia compact spaces and the Corson compact spaces. Here, we characterized a compact space with an r-skeleton, for which the given r-skeleton can be extended to an r-skeleton on the Alexandroff Duplicate of the given space. Besides, we prove that if X is a zero-dimensional compact space without isolated points and \{r_s:s\in \Gamma\} is an r-skeleton on X, then there is s\in \Gamma such that cl(r_s[X]) is not countable.
