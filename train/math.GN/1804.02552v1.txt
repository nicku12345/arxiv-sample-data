The famous Rosenthal-Lacey theorem asserts that for each infinite compact set K the Banach space C(K) admits a quotient which is either a copy of c or \ell_{2}. What is the case when the uniform topology of C(K) is replaced by the pointwise topology? Is it true that C_p(X) always has an infinite-dimensional separable (or better metrizable) quotient? In this paper we prove that for a Tychonoff space X the function space C_p(X) has an infinite-dimensional metrizable quotient if X either contains an infinite discrete C^*-embedded subspace or else X has a sequence (K_n)_{n\in\mathbb N} of compact subsets such that for every n the space K_n contains two disjoint topological copies of K_{n+1}. Applying the latter result, we show that under \lozenge there exists a zero-dimensional Efimov space K whose function space C_{p}(K) has an infinite-dimensional metrizable quotient. These two theorems essentially improve earlier results of K\k{a}kol and \'Sliwa on infinite-dimensional separable quotients of C_p-spaces.
