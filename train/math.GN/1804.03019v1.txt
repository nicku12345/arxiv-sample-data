Given a topological property P, we say that the space X is P-generated if for any subset A\subset X that is not open in X there is a subspace Y \subset X with property P such that A\cap Y is not open in Y. (Of course, in this definition we could replace "open" with "closed".)   In this paper we prove the following two results:   (1) Every Lindel\"of-generated regular space X satisfying |X|=\Delta(X)={\omega}_1 is {\omega}_1-resolvable.   (2) Any (countable extent)-generated regular space X satisfying \Delta(X)>{\omega} is {\omega}-resolvable.   These are significant strengthenings of our earlier results from [JSSz] which can be obtained from (1) and (2) by simply omitting the "-generated" part. Moreover, the second result improves a recent result of Filatova and Osipov from [FO] which states that Lindel\"of-generated regular spaces of uncountable dispersion character are 2-resolvable.
