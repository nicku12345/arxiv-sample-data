We study the interplay between three weak topologies on a topological semilattice X: the weak^\circ topology \mathcal W^\circ_X (generated by the base consiting of open subsemilattices of X), the weak^\bullet topology \mathcal W^\bullet_X (generated by the subbase consisting of complements to closed subsemilattices), and the \mathbb I-weak topology \mathcal W_X (which is the weakest topology in which all continuous homomorphisms h:X\to [0,1] remain continuous). Also we study the interplay between the weak topologies \mathcal W^\bullet_X, \mathcal W^\circ_X, \mathcal W_X of a topological semilattice X and the Scott and Lawson topologies \mathcal S_X and \mathcal L_X, which are determined by the order structure of the semilattice.   We prove that the weak^\bullet topology \mathcal W^\bullet on a Hausdorff semitopological semilattice X is compact if and only if X is chain-compact in the sense that each closed chain in X is compact. This result implies that the Lawson topology \mathcal L_X on a semilattice X is compact if and only if X is a continuous semilattice if and only if X complete in the sense that each non-empty chain C in X has \inf(C) and \sup(C) in X.   For a chain-compact Hausdorff topological semilattice X with topology \mathcal T_X we prove the inclusions \mathcal W_X\subset\mathcal L_X\subset\mathcal W^\bullet_X\subset\mathcal T_X. For a compact topological semilattice X we prove that \mathcal T_X=\mathcal W^\bullet_X if and only if \mathcal T_X=\mathcal L_X if and only if \mathcal T_X=\mathcal L_X.
