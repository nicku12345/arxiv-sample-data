The concept of typed topological space is introduced, for which open sets in a topology on a finite set will be assigned types (from lattice). The neighborhood system of a point, the closure and the connectedness can be defined according to chain of types, which effectively avoids the situation when most singletons are closed an open. Furthermore, statistics can be used to provide semantics of points with statistical characteristics.
