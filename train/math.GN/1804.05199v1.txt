The free topological vector space (tvs) \mathbb{V}(X) over a Tychonoff space X is defined and studied by Sidney A. Morris and the author in [2]. A description of the topology of the free tvs \mathbb{V}(X) over a uniform space X is given in [1]. In this note we give a similar but simpler and clearer description of the topology of free tvs \mathbb{V}(X) over a Tychonoff space X.
