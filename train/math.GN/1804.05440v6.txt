We show that every connected set X which is irreducible between two points a and b embeds into the Hilbert cube in a way that X\cup \{c\} is irreducible between a and b for every point c in the closure of X. Also, a connected set X is indecomposable if and only if for every compactum Y\supseteq X and a\in X there are two points b and c in the closure of X such that X\cup \{b,c\} is irreducible between every two points from \{a,b,c\}. Following the proofs of these theorems, we illustrate a cube embedding of the main example from "On indecomposability of \beta X". We prove the example embeds into the plane.
