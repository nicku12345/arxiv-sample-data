First, we generalize the definition of a locally compact topology given by Paterson and Welch for a sequence of locally compact spaces to the case where the underlying spaces are T_1 and sober. We then consider a certain semilattice of basic open sets for this topology on the space of all paths on a graph and impose relations motivated by the definitions of graph C*-algebra in order to recover the boundary path space of a graph. This is done using techniques of pointless topology. Finally, we generalize the results to the case of topological graphs.
