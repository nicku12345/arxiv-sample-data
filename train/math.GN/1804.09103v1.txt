We study the question of when an uncountable ccc topological space X contains a ccc subspace of size \aleph_1. We show that it does if X is compact Hausdorff and more generally if X is Hausdorff with \mathrm{pct}(X) \leq \aleph_1. For each regular cardinal \kappa, an example is constructed of a ccc Tychonoff space of size \kappa and countable pseudocharacter but with no ccc subspace of size less than \kappa. We also give a ccc compact T_1 space of size \kappa with no ccc subspace of size less than \kappa.
