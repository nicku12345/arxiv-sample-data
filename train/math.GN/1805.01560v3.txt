In this paper, we approach the question if some of the separation axioms are equivalent in the class of asymmetric normed spaces. In particular, we make a remark on a known theorem which states that every T_1 asymmetric normed space with compact closed unit ball must be finite-dimensional. We also explore the product structure of these spaces and characterize the topological (covering) dimension of all finite-dimensional asymmetric normed spaces.
