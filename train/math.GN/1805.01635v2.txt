We investigate \mathcal F-Borel topological spaces. We focus on finding out how a~complexity of a~space depends on where the~space is embedded. Of a~particular interest is the~problem of determining whether a~complexity of given space X is absolute (that is, the~same in every compactification of X). We show that the~complexity of metrizable spaces is absolute and provide a~sufficient condition for a~topological space to be absolutely \mathcal F_{\sigma\delta}. We then investigate the~relation between local and global complexity. To improve our understanding of \mathcal F-Borel spaces, we introduce different ways of representing an~\mathcal F-Borel set. We use these tools to construct a~hierarchy of \mathcal F-Borel spaces with non-absolute complexity, and to prove several other results.
