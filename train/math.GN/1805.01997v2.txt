We prove that for a continuum K\subset \mathbb R^n the sum K^{+n} of n copies of K has non-empty interior in \mathbb R^n if and only if K is not flat in the sense that the affine hull of K coincides with \mathbb R^n. Moreover, if K is locally connected and each non-empty open subset of K in not flat, then for any (analytic) non-meager subset A\subset K the sum A^{+n} of n copies of A is not meager in \mathbb R^n (and then the sum A^{+2n} of 2n copies of the analytic set A has non-empty interior in \mathbb R^n and the set (A-A)^{+n} is a neighborhood of zero in \mathbb R^n). This implies that a mid-convex function f:D\to\mathbb R, defined on an open convex subset D\subset\mathbb R^n is continuous if it is upper bounded on some non-flat continuum in D or on a non-meager analytic subset of a locally connected nowhere flat subset of D.
