The G_\delta-modification X_\delta of a topological space X is the space on the same underlying set generated by, i.e. having as a basis, the collection of all G_\delta subsets of X. Bella and Spadaro recently investigated the connection between the values of various cardinal functions taken on X and X_\delta, respectively. In their paper, as Question 2, they raised the following problem: Is t(X_\delta) \le 2^{t(X)} true for every (compact) T_2 space X? Note that this is actually two questions.   In this note we answer both questions: In the compact case affirmatively and in the non-compact case negatively. In fact, in the latter case we even show that it is consistent with ZFC that no upper bound exists for the tightness of the G_\delta-modifications of countably tight, even Frechet spaces.
