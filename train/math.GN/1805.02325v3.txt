Motivated by a Steinhaus-like interior-point property involving the Cameron-Martin space of Gaussian measure theory, we study a group-theoretic analogue, the Steinhaus triple (H,G,\mu), and construct a Steinhaus support, a Cameron-Martin-like subset, H(\mu) in any Polish group G corresponding to `sufficiently subcontinuous' measures \mu, in particular for `Solecki-type' reference measures.
