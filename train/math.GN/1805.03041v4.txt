In this paper we show that a digital (\kappa,\lambda)-continuous surjection p:(E,\kappa)\rightarrow (B,\lambda) is a digital covering map if and only if it is a local isomorphism. Moreover, we find a loop criterion for a digital covering map to be an n-radius covering. Also, we show that every digitally continuous map with unique path lifting property is a digital covering map if it has no conciliator point.
