In the paper we describe the group \mathbf{Aut}\left(\mathscr{C}_{\mathbb{Z}}\right) of automorphisms of the extended bicyclic semigroup \mathscr{C}_{\mathbb{Z}} and study the variants \mathscr{C}_{\mathbb{Z}}^{m,n} of the extended bicycle semigroup \mathscr{C}_{\mathbb{Z}}, where m,n\in\mathbb{Z}. In particular, we prove that \mathbf{Aut}\left(\mathscr{C}_{\mathbb{Z}}\right) is isomorphic to the additive group of integers, the extended bicyclic semigroup \mathscr{C}_{\mathbb{Z}} and every its variant are not finitely generated, and describe the subset of idempotents E(\mathscr{C}_{\mathbb{Z}}^{m,n}) and Green's relations on the semigroup \mathscr{C}_{\mathbb{Z}}^{m,n}. Also we show that E(\mathscr{C}_{\mathbb{Z}}^{m,n}) is an \omega-chain and any two variants of the extended bicyclic semigroup \mathscr{C}_{\mathbb{Z}} are isomorphic. At the end we discuss shift-continuous Hausdorff topologies on the variant \mathscr{C}_{\mathbb{Z}}^{0,0}. In particular, we prove that if \tau is a Hausdorff shift-continuous topology on \mathscr{C}_{\mathbb{Z}}^{0,0} then each of inequalities a>0 or b>0 implies that (a,b) is an isolated point of \big(\mathscr{C}_{\mathbb{Z}}^{0,0},\tau\big) and construct an example of a Hausdorff semigroup topology \tau^* on the semigroup \mathscr{C}_{\mathbb{Z}}^{0,0} such that all its points with ab\leqslant 0 and a+b\leqslant 0 are not isolated in \big(\mathscr{C}_{\mathbb{Z}}^{0,0},\tau^*\big).
