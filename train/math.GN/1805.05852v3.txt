In studies of smooth maps with good differential topological conditions such as immersions, embeddings, Morse functions and their higher dimensional versions including fold maps and application to geometry, especially algebraic and differential topology of manifolds, liftings or desingulizations of maps of appropriate classes to other maps of other appropriate classes are fundamental and important. In this paper, we consider Morse functions such that inverse images of regular values are disjoint unions of spheres, which are extensions of Morse functions with just two singular points on homotopy spheres, and defined and studied by Saeki and Suzuoka in 2000s, and lift them to immersions, embeddings and special generic maps, which are regarded as higher dimensional versions of Morse functions with just 2 singular points before. In lifting smooth maps, we usually lift them to immersions or embeddings and in this paper, as new works, we consider lifts to special generic maps, whose codimensions are not positive. In addition, we construct most of lifts by new methods.
