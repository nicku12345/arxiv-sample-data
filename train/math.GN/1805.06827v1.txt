Clearly, a generalized inverse limit of metrizable spaces indexed by \mathbb N is metrizable, as it is a subspace of a countable product of metrizable spaces. The authors previously showed that all idempotent, upper semi-continuous, surjective, continuum-valued bonding functions on [0,1] (besides the identity) satisfy a certain Condition \Gamma; it follows that only in trivial cases can a generalized inverse limit of copies of ([0,1]) indexed by an uncountable ordinal be metrizable. The authors show that Condition \Gamma is in fact guaranteed by much weaker criteria, proving a more general metrizability theorem for certain Mahavier Products.
