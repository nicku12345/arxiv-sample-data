Let X be the countable product of Abelian locally compact Polish groups and A,B\subset X be two Borel sets, which are not Haar-null in X. We prove that the sum-set A+B:=\{a+b:a\in A,\;\;b\in B\} is Haar-open in the sense that for any non-empty compact subset K\subset X and point p\in K there exists a point x\in X such that the set K\cap(A+B+x) is a neighborhood of p in K. This is a generalization of the classical Steinhaus Theorem (1920) to non-locally compact groups. We do not know if this generalization holds for Banach spaces.
