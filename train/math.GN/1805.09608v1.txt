We introduce a new class of locally compact groups, namely the strongly compactly covered groups, which are the Hausdorff topological groups G such that every element of G is contained in a compact open normal subgroup of G. For continuous endomorphisms \phi:G\to G of these groups we compute the algebraic entropy and study its properties. Also an Addition Theorem is available under suitable conditions.
