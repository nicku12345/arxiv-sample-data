For a compactification \alpha X of a Tychonoff space X, the algebra of all functions f\in C(X) that are continuously extendable over % \alpha X is denoted by C_{\alpha}(X). It is shown that, in a model of \textbf{ZF}, it may happen that a discrete space X can have non-equivalent Hausdorff compactifications \alpha X and \gamma X such that % C_{\alpha}(X)=C_{\gamma}(X). Amorphous sets are applied to a proof that Glicksberg's theorem that \beta X\times \beta Y is the Cech-Stone compactification of X\times Y when X\times Y is a Tychonoff pseudocompact space is false in some models of \mathbf{ZF}. It is noticed that if all Tychonoff compactifications of locally compact spaces had C^{\ast}-embedded remainders, then van Douwen's choice principle would be satisfied. Necessary and sufficient conditions for a set of continuous bounded real functions on a Tychonoff space X to generate a compactification of X are given in \mathbf{ZF}. A concept of a functional \v{C}ech-Stone compactification is investigated in the absence of the axiom of choice.
