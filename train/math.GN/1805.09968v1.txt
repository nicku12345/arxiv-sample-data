We study two form of selective selective separability, SS and SS^+, on countable spaces with an analytic topology. We show several Ramsey type properties which imply SS. For analytic spaces X, SS^+ is equivalent to have that the collection of dense sets is a G_\delta subset of 2^X, and also equivalent to the existence of a weak base which is an F_\sigma-subset of 2^X. We study several examples of analytic spaces.
