Coarse geometry, the branch of topology that studies the global properties of spaces, was originally developed for metric spaces and then Roe introduced coarse structures as a large-scale counterpart of uniformities. In the literature, there are very important generalisations of uniform spaces, such as semi-uniform and quasi-uniform spaces. In this paper, we introduce and start to study their large-scale counterparts, which generalise coarse spaces: semi-coarse spaces and quasi-coarse spaces.
