Given an arbitrary spectral space X, we consider the set {\boldsymbol{\mathcal{X}}}(X) of all nonempty subsets of X that are closed with respect to the inverse topology. We introduce a Zariski-like topology on {\boldsymbol{\mathcal{X}}}(X) and, after observing that it coincides the upper Vietoris topology, we prove that {\boldsymbol{\mathcal{X}}}(X) is itself a spectral space, that this construction is functorial, and that {\boldsymbol{\mathcal{X}}}(X) provides an extension of X in a more `complete' spectral space. Among the applications, we show that, starting from an integral domain D, {\boldsymbol{\mathcal{X}}}(\mathrm{Spec}(D)) is homeomorphic to the (spectral) space of all the stable semistar operations of finite type on D.
