Given a countable transitive model M for ZFC+CH, we prove that one can produce a maximal almost disjoint family in M whose Vietoris Hyperspace of its Isbell-Mr\'owka space is pseudocompact on every Cohen extension of M. We also show that a classical example of \omega_1-sized maximal almost disjoint family obtained by a forcing iteration of length \omega_1 in a model of non CH is such that the Vietoris Hyperspace of its Isbell-Mr\'owka space is pseudocompact.
