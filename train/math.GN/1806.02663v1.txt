In this paper, we introduced two new generalized metric spaces called partial b_{v}(s) and b_{v}({\theta}) metric spaces which extend b_{v}(s) metric space, b-metric space, rectangular metric space, v-generalized metric space, partial metric space, partial b-metric space, partial rectangular b-metric space and so on. We proved some famous theorems such as Banach, Kannan and Reich fixed point theorems in these spaces. Also, we give definition of partial v-generalized metric space and show that these fixed point theorems are valid in this space. We also give numerical examples to support our definitions. Our results generalize several corresponding results in literature.
