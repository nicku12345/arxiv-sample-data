The set of all maximal ideals of the ring \mathcal{M}(X,\mathcal{A}) of real valued measurable functions on a measurable space (X,\mathcal{A}) equipped with the hull-kernel topology is shown to be homeomorphic to the set \hat{X} of all ultrafilters of measurable sets on X with the Stone-topology. This yields a complete description of the maximal ideals of \mathcal{M}(X,\mathcal{A}) in terms of the points of \hat{X}. It is further shown that the structure spaces of all the intermediate subrings of \mathcal{M}(X,\mathcal{A}) containing the bounded measurable functions are one and the same and are compact Hausdorff zero-dimensional spaces. It is observed that when X is a P-space, then C(X) = \mathcal{M}(X,\mathcal{A}) where \mathcal{A} is the \sigma-algebra consisting of the zero-sets of X.
