A topologized semilattice X is called complete if each non-empty chain C\subset X has \inf C\in\bar C and \sup C\in\bar C. We prove that for any continuous homomorphism h:X\to Y from a complete topologized semilattice X to a sequential Hausdorff semitopological semilattice Y the image h(X) is closed in Y.
