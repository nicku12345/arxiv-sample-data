A topologized semilattice X is complete if each non-empty chain C\subset X has \inf C\in\bar C and \sup C\in\bar C. It is proved that for any complete subsemilattice X of a functionally Hausdorff semitopological semilattice Y the partial order P=\{(x,y)\in X\times X:xy=x\} of X is closed in Y\times Y and hence X is closed in Y. This implies that for any continuous homomorphism h:X\to Y from a compete topologized semilattice X to a functionally Hausdorff semitopological semilattice Y the image h(X) is closed in Y. The functional Hausdorffness of Y in these two results can be replaced by the weaker separation axiom \vec T_{2\delta}, defined in this paper.
