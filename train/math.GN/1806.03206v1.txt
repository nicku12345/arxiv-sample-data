For any Polish space X it is well-known that the Cantor-Bendixson rank provides a co-analytic rank on F_{\aleph_0}(X) if and only if X is a \sigma-compact. In the case of \omega^\omega one may recover a co-analytic rank on F_{\aleph_0}(\omega^\omega) by considering the Cantor-Bendixson rank of the induced trees instead. In this paper we will generalize this idea to arbitrary Polish spaces and thereby construct a family of co-analytic ranks on F_{\aleph_0}(X) for any Polish space X. We study the behaviour of this family and compare the ranks to the original Cantor-Bendixson rank. The main results are characterizations of the compact and \sigma-compact Polish spaces in terms of this behaviour.
