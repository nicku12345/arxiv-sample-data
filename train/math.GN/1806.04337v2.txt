A bornology on a set X is a family \mathcal{B} of subsets of X closed under taking subsets, finite unions and such that \cup \mathcal{B}=X. We prove that, for a bornology \mathcal{B} on X, the following statements are equivalent:   (1) there exists a vector topology \tau on the vector space \mathbb{V} (X)  over \mathbb{R} such that \mathcal{B} is the family of all subsets of X bounded in \tau;   (2) there exists a uniformity \mathcal{U} on X such that \mathcal{B} is the family of all subsets of X totally bounded in \mathcal{U};   (3) for every Y \subseteq X, Y \notin \mathcal{B}, there exists a metric d on X such that \mathcal{B}\subseteq \mathcal{B}_d, Y\notin \mathcal{B}_d, where \mathcal{B}_d is the family of all closed discrete subsets of (X, d);   (4) for every Y \subseteq X, Y \notin \mathcal{B}, there exists Z\subseteq Y such that Z^{\prime} \notin \mathcal{B} for each infinite subset Z^{\prime} of Z.   A bornology \mathcal{B} satisfying (4) is called antitall. We give topological and functional characterizations of antitall bornologies.
