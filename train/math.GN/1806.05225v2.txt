We prove that for a chainable continuum X and every non-zigzag x\in X there exists a planar embedding \phi:X\to \phi(X)\subset\mathbb R^2 such that \phi(x) is accessible, partially answering the question of Nadler and Quinn from 1972. Two embeddings \phi,\psi:X \to \mathbb R^2 are called strongly equivalent if \phi \circ \psi^{-1}: \psi(X) \to \phi(X) can be extended to a homeomorphism of \mathbb R^2. We also prove that every indecomposable chainable continuum can be embedded in the plane in uncountably many strongly non-equivalent ways.
