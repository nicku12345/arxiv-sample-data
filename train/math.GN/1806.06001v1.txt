We relate the property of discrete selectivity and its corresponding game, both recently introduced by V.V. Tkachuck, to a variety of selection principles and point picking games. In particular we show that player II can win the discrete selection game on \(C_p(X)\) if and only if player II can win a variant of the point open game on \(X\). We also show that the existence of limited information strategies in the discrete selection game on \(C_p(X)\) for either player are equivalent to other well-known topological properties.
