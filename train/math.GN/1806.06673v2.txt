We present an approach to the factorization method for second order difference equations on time scales. We construct Hilbert spaces of functions on the time scale and show how to construct a chain of intertwined first order \Delta-difference operators \mathcal A_k in the sense that \mathcal A_k and \mathcal A_k^* act as ladder operators generating new solutions of eigenproblem of \mathcal A_k\mathcal A_k^*.
