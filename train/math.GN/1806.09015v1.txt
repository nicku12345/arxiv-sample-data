We conclude the classification of spaces of continuous functions on ordinals carried out by R. Gorak. This gives a complete topological classification of the spaces C_p([0,\alpha]) of all continuous real-valued functions on compact segments of ordinals endowed with the topology of pointwise convergence. Moreover, this topological classification of the spaces C_p([0,\alpha]) completely coincides with their uniform classification.
