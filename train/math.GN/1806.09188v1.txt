In this paper we have studied the ideas of I-divergence and I*-divergence of sequences in cone metric spaces. We have investigated the relationship between I-divergence and I*-divergence and their equivalence under certain condition. Further we prove a decomposition theorem for I-convergent sequences in a cone normed space.
