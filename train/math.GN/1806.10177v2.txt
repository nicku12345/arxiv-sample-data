Let (X,\tau) be a Hausdorff space, where X is an infinite set. The compact complement topology \tau^{\star} on X is defined by: \tau^{\star}=\{\emptyset\} \cup \{X\setminus M, \text{where M is compact in (X,\tau)}\}. In this paper, properties of the space (X, \tau^{\star}) are studied in \mathbf{ZF} and applied to a characterization of k-spaces, to the Sorgenfrey line, to some statements independent of \mathbf{ZF}, as well as to partial topologies that are among Delfs-Knebusch generalized topologies. Among other results, it is proved that the axiom of countable multiple choice (\textbf{CMC}) is equivalent with each of the following two sentences: (i) every Hausdorff first countable space is a k-space, (ii) every metrizable space is a k-space. A \textbf{ZF}-example of a countable metrizable space whose compact complement topology is not first countable is given.
