Let X be a nondegenerate Peano unicoherent continuum. The family CB(X) of proper subcontinua of X with connected boundaries is a G_\delta-subset of the hyperspace C(X) of all subcontinua of X. If every nonempty open subset of X contains an open subset homeomorphic to \mathbb R^n (such space is called \pi-n-Euclidean) and 2\le n<\infty, then C(X)\setminus CB(X) is recognized as an F_\sigma-absorber in C(X); if additionally, no one-dimensional subset separates X, then the family of all members of CB(X) which separate X is a D_2(F_\sigma)-absorber in C(X), where D_2(F_\sigma) denotes the small Borel class of differences of two \sigma-compacta.
