Suppose Y is a continuum, x\in Y, and X is the union of all nowhere dense subcontinua of Y containing x. Suppose further that there exists y\in Y such that every connected subset of X limiting to y is dense in X. And, suppose X is dense in Y. We prove X is homeomorphic to a composant of an indecomposable continuum, even though Y may be decomposable. An example establishing the latter was given by Christopher Mouron and Norberto Ordo\~nez in 2016. If Y is chainable or, more generally, an inverse limit of identical topological graphs, then we show Y is indecomposable and X is a composant of Y. For homogeneous continua we explore similar problems which are related to a 2007 question of Janusz Prajs and Keith Whittington.
