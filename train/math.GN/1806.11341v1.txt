Two non-empty sets A,B of a metric space (X,d) are called parallel if d(a,B)=d(A,B)=d(A,b) for any points a\in A and b\in B. Answering a question posed on Mathoverflow, we prove that for a cover \mathcal C of a metrizable space X the following conditions are equivalent: (i) the topology of X is generated by a metric d such that any two sets A,B\in\mathcal C are parallel; (ii) the cover \mathcal C is disjoint, lower semicontinuous and upper semicontinuous.
