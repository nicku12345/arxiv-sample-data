Following Darji, we say that a Borel subset B of an abelian Polish group G is Haar meager if there is a compact metric space K and a continuous function f : K \to G such that the preimage of the translate, f^{-1}(B+g) is meager in K for every g \in G. The set B is called strongly Haar meager if there is a compact set C \subseteq G such that (B+g) \cap C is meager in C for every g \in G. The main open problem in this area is Darji's question asking whether these two notions are the same. Even though there have been several partial results suggesting a positive answer, in this paper we construct a counterexample. More specifically, we construct a G_\delta set in \mathbb{Z}^\omega that is Haar meager but not strongly Haar meager. We also show that no F_\sigma counterexample exists, hence our result is optimal.
