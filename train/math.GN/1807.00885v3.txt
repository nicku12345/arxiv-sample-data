We introduce an alternative description of coarse proximities. We define a coarse normality condition for connected coarse spaces and show that this definition agrees with large scale normality defined in [3] and asymptotic normality defined in [7]. We utilize the alternative definition of coarse proximities to show that a connected coarse space naturally induces a coarse proximity if and only if the connected coarse space is coarsely normal. We conclude with showing that every connected asymptotic resemblance space induces a coarse proximity if and only if the connected asymptotic resemblance space is asymptotically normal.
