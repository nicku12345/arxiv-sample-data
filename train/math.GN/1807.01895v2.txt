For a Tychonoff space X, we will denote by USC_{p}(X) (B_1(X)) a set of all real-valued upper semicontinuous functions (a set of all Baire functions of class 1) defined on X endowed with the pointwise convergence topology. In this paper we describe a class of Tychonoff spaces X for which the space USC_{p}(X) is sequentially separable. Unexpectedly, it turns out that this class coincides with the class of spaces for which a stronger form of the sequential separability for the space B_1(X) holds.
