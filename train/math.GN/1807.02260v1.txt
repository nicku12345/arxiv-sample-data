Let F(X) be the free topological group on a Tychonoff space X. For all natural numbers n we denote by F_n(X) the subset of F(X) consisting of all words of reduced length \leq n. In \cite{Y3}, the author found equivalent conditions on a metrizable space X for F_3(X) to be Fr\'echet-Urysohn, and for F_n(X) to be Fr\'echet-Urysohn for n\geq5. However, no equivalent condition on X for n=4 was found. In this paper, we give the equivalent condition. In fact, we show that for a metrizable space X, if the set of all non-isolated points of X is compact, then F_4(X) is Fr\'echet-Urysohn. Consequently, for a metrizable space X F_3(X) is Fr\'echet-Urysohn if and only if F_4(X) is Fr\'echet-Urysohn.
