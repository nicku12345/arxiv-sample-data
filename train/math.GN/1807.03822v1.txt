Metric spaces satisfying properties stronger than completeness and weaker than compactness have been studied by many authors over the years. One such significant family is that of cofinally complete metric spaces. We discuss the relationship between cofinally complete metric spaces and the family of almost uniformly continuous functions, which has recently been introduced by Kyriakos Keremedis in \cite{[K]}. We also discuss several equivalent conditions for metric spaces whose completions are cofinally complete in terms of some geometric functional.
