To work more accurately with elements of the semigroup of the Stone Cech compactification of the discrete semigroup of natural numbers N under multiplication. We divided these elements into ultrafilters which are on finite levels and ultrafilters which are not on finite levels. For the ultrafilters that are on finite levels we prove that any element is irreducible or product of irreducible elements and all elements on higher levels are extension divided by some elements on lower levels. We characterize ultrafilters that are not on finite levels and the effect of extension divisibility on the ultrafilters which are not on finite levels.
