The aim of this study to investigate the existence of solutions for the following nonlocal integral boundary value problem of Caputo type fractional differential inclusions. To achieve our goals, we take advantage of fixed point theorems for multivalued mappings satisfying a new class of contractive conditions in the setting of complete metric spaces. We derive new fixed point results which extend and improve many results in the literature by means of this new class of contractions. We also supply some examples to support the new theory.
