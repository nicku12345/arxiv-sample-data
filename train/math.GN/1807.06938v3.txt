The H-space, denoted as (\mathbb{R}, \tau_{A}), has \mathbb{R} as its point set and a basis consisting of usual \mathbb{R} neighborhood at points of A while taking Sorgenfrey neighborhoods at points of \mathbb{R}-A. In this paper, we mainly discuss some topological properties of H-spaces. In particular, we main prove that, for any subset A\subset \mathbb{R},   (1) (\mathbb{R}, \tau_{A}) is zero-dimensional iff \mathbb{R}\setminus A is dense in (\mathbb{R}, \tau_{E});   (2) (\mathbb{R}, \tau_{A}) is locally compact iff (\mathbb{R}, \tau_{A}) is a k_{\omega}-space;   (3) if (\mathbb{R}, \tau_{A}) is \sigma-compact, then \mathbb{R}\setminus A is countable and nowhere dense; if \mathbb{R}\setminus A is countable and scattered, then (\mathbb{R}, \tau_{A}) is \sigma-compact;   (4) (\mathbb{R}, \tau_{A})^{\aleph_{0}} is perfectly subparacompact;   (5) there exists a subset A\subset\mathbb{R} such that (\mathbb{R}, \tau_{A}) is not quasi-metrizable;   (6) (\mathbb{R}, \tau_{A}) is metrizable if and only if (\mathbb{R}, \tau_{A}) is a \beta-space.
