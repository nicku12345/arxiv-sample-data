We show the classical \pi_1-action on the n-th homotopy group can fail to be continuous for any n when the homotopy groups are equipped with the natural quotient topology. In particular, we prove the action \pi_1(X)\times\pi_n(X)\to\pi_n(X) fails to be continuous for a one-point union X=A\vee \mathbb{H}_n where A is an aspherical space such that \pi_1(A) is a topological group and \mathbb{H}_n is the (n-1)-connected, n-dimensional Hawaiian earring space \mathbb{H}_n for which \pi_n(\mathbb{H}_n) is a topological abelian group.
