If \Gamma is the range of a Jordan curve that bounds a convex set in \mathbb{R}^2, then \frac{1}{2}(\Gamma+\Gamma)=\mathsf{co}(\Gamma), where + is the Minkowski sum and \mathsf{co} is the convex hull. Answering a question of V.N. Ushakov, we construct a simple closed curve in \mathbb{R}^3 with range \Gamma such that \frac{1}{2}(\Gamma+\Gamma)=[0,1]^3=\mathsf{co}(\Gamma). Also we show that such simple closed curve cannot be rectifiable.
