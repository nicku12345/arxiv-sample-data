In this article we study the annihilating-ideal graph of the ring C(X). We have tried to associate the graph properties of \mathbb{AG}(X), the ring properties of C(X) and the topological properties of X. We have shown that  X  has an isolated point \ff  \mathbb{R}  is a direct summand of  C(X)  if and only if  \mathbb{AG}(X)  is not triangulated. Radius, girth, dominating number and clique number of the \mathbb{AG}(X) are investigated. We have proved that  c(X) \leqslant \mathrm{dt}(\mathbb{AG}(X)) \leqslant w(X)  and  \mathrm{clique} \mathbb{AG}(X) = \chi \mathbb{AG}(X) = c(X) .
