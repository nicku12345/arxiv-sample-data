Let \{ G_n\}_{n\in\w} be a closed tower of metrizable groups. Under a mild condition called (GC) and which is strictly weaker than PTA condition introduced in [22], we show that: (1) the inductive limit G=\mbox{g-}\underrightarrow{\lim}\, G_n of the tower is a Hausdorff group, (2) every G_n is a closed subgroup of G, (3) if K is a compact subset of G, then K\subseteq G_m for some m\in\omega, (4) G has a \mathfrak{G}-base and countable tightness, (5) G is an \aleph-space, (6) G is an Ascoli space if and only if either (i) there is m\in\omega such that G_n is open in G_{n+1} for every n\geq m, so G is metrizable; or (ii) all the groups G_n are locally compact and G is a sequential non-Fr\'{e}chet--Urysohn space.
