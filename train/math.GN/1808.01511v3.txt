A subset \mathcal X of a C*-algebra \mathcal A is called irredundant if no A\in \mathcal X belongs to the C*-subalgebra of \mathcal A generated by \mathcal X\setminus \{A\}. Separable C*-algebras cannot have uncountable irredundant sets and all members of many classes of nonseparable C*-algebras, e.g., infinite dimensional von Neumann algebras have irredundant sets of cardinality continuum.   There exists a considerable literature showing that the question whether every AF commutative nonseparable C*-algebra has an uncountable irredundant set is sensitive to additional set-theoretic axioms and we investigate here the noncommutative case.   Assuming \diamondsuit (an additional axiom stronger than the continuum hypothesis) we prove that there is an AF C*-subalgebra of \mathcal B(\ell_2) of density 2^\omega=\omega_1 with no nonseparable commutative C*-subalgebra and with no uncountable irredundant set. On the other hand we also prove that it is consistent that every discrete collection of operators in \mathcal B(\ell_2) of cardinality continuum contains an irredundant subcollection of cardinality continuum.   Other partial results and more open problems are presented.
