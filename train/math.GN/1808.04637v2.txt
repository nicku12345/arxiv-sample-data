We will prove that, for any abelian group G, the canonical (surjective and continuous) mapping \boldsymbol{\beta}G \to {\frak b}G from the Stone-\v{C}ech compactification \boldsymbol{\beta}G of G to its Bohr compactfication {\frak b}G is a homomorphism with respect to the semigroup operation on \boldsymbol{\beta}G, extending the multiplication on G, and the group operation on {\frak b}G. Moreover, the Bohr compactification {\frak b}G is canonically isomorphic (both in algebraic and topological sense) to the quotient of \boldsymbol{\beta}G with respect to the least closed congruence relation on \boldsymbol{\beta}G merging all the Schur ultrafilters on G into the unit of G.
