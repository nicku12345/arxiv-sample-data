Let A be any plane set. It is known that a holomorphic motion h: A \times \mathbb{D} \to \mathbb{C} always extends to a holomorphic motion of the entire plane. It was recently shown that any isotopy h: X \times [0,1] \to \mathbb{C}, starting at the identity, of a plane continuum X also extends to an isotopy of the entire plane. Easy examples show that this result does not generalize to all plane compacta. In this paper we will provide a characterization of isotopies of uniformly perfect plane compacta X which extend to an isotopy of the entire plane. Using this characterization, we prove that such an extension is always possible provided the diameters of all components of X are uniformly bounded away from zero.
