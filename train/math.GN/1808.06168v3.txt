Applying a general categorical construction for the extension of dualities, we present a new proof of the Fedorchuk duality between the category of compact Hausdorff spaces with their quasi-open mappings and the category of complete normal contact algebras with suprema-preserving Boolean homomorphisms which reflect the contact relation.
