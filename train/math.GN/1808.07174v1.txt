In [8] the authors initiate the study of selective versions of the notion of \theta-separability in non-regular spaces. In this paper we continue this investigation by establishing connections between the familiar cardinal numbers arising in the set theory of the real line, and game-theoretic assertions regarding \theta-separability.
