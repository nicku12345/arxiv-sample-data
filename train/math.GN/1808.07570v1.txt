In this paper we extend the theory of H-closed extensions of Hausdorff spaces to a class of non-Hausdorff spaces, defined in \cite{B}, called n-Hausdorff spaces. The notion of H-closed is generalized to an n-H-closed space. Known construction for Hausdorff spaces X, such as the Kat\v{e}tov H-closed extension \kappa X, are generalized to a maximal n-H-closed extension denoted by n-\kappa X.
