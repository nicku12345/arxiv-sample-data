For a hypergraph H=(V,\mathcal E), a subfamily \mathcal C\subseteq \mathcal E is called a cover of the hypergraph if \bigcup\mathcal C=\bigcup\mathcal E. A cover \mathcal C is called minimal if each cover \mathcal D\subseteq\mathcal C of the hypergraph H coincides with \mathcal C. We prove that for a hypergraph H the following conditions are equivalent: (i) each countable subhypergraph of H has a minimal cover; (ii) each non-empty subhypergraph of H has a maximal edge; (iii) H contains no isomorphic copy of the hypergraph (\omega,\omega). This characterization implies that a countable hypergraph (V,\mathcal E) has a minimal cover if every infinite set I\subseteq V contains a finite subset F\subseteq I such that the family of edges \mathcal E_F:=\{E\in\mathcal E:F\subseteq E\} is finite. Also we prove that a hypergraph (V,\mathcal E) has a minimal cover if \sup\{|E|:E\in\mathcal E\}<\omega or for every v\in V the family \mathcal E_v:=\{E\in\mathcal E:v\in E\} is finite.
