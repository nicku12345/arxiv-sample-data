In this paper we study the reflections of the category of topological and semitopological semigroups on the category of the class of topological spaces satisfying separation axioms T_{0}, T_{1}, T_{2}, T_{3} and regular and we apply its properties for to find conditions under which a topological semigroup has the Souslin property.
