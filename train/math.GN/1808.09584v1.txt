A continuum is a compact connected metric space. A non-empty closed subset B of a continuum X does not block x\in X\setminus B provided that the union of all subcontinua of X containing x and contained in X\setminus B is dense in X. We denote the collection of all non-empty closed subset B of X such that B does not block each element of X\setminus B by NB(F_1(X)). In this paper we show some properties of the hyperspace NB(F_1(X)). Particularly, we prove that the simple closed curve is the unique continuum X such that NB(F_1(X))=F_1(X), given a positive answer to a question posed by Escobedo, Estrada-Obreg\'on and Villanueva in 2012.
