We prove that an injective map f:X\to Y between connected metrizable spaces X,Y is continuous if for every connected subset C\subset X the image f(C) is connected and one of the following conditions is satisfied:   (1) Y is a 1-manifold and X is compact;   (2) Y is a 2-manifold and X is a closed n-manifold of dimension n\ge 2;   (3) Y is a 3-manifold and X is a simply-connected closed n-manifold of dimension n\ge 3.   This gives a partial answer to a problem of Willie Wong, posed on Mathoverflow.
