This paper pays a visit to a famous contractible open 3-manifold W^3 proposed by R. H. Bing in 1950's. By the finiteness theorem \cite{Hak68}, Haken proved that W^3 can embed in no compact 3-manifold. However, until now, the question about whether W^3 can embed in a more general compact space such as a compact, locally connected and locally 1-connected metric 3-space was not known. Using the techniques developed in Sternfeld's 1977 PhD thesis \cite{Ste77}, we answer the above question in negative. Furthermore, it is shown that W^3 can be utilized to produce counterexamples for every contractible open n-manifold (n\geq 4) embeds in a compact, locally connected and locally 1-connected metric n-space.
