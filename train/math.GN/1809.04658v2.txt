Each series \sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n of real positive terms gives rise to a topology on \mathbb{N} = \{1,2,3,...\} by declaring a proper subset A\subseteq \mathbb{N} to be closed if \sum_{n\in A} a_n < \infty. We explore the relationship between analytic properties of the series and topological properties on \mathbb{N}. In particular, we show that, up to homeomorphism, |\mathbb{R}|-many topologies are generated. We also find an uncountable family of examples \{\mathbb{N}_\alpha\}_{\alpha \in [0,1]} with the property that for any \alpha < \beta, there is a continuous bijection \mathbb{N}_\beta\rightarrow \mathbb{N}_\alpha, but the only continuous functions \mathbb{N}_\alpha\rightarrow \mathbb{N}_\beta are constant.
