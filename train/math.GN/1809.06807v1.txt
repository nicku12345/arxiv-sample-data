Let X be a Hausdorff space and let \mathcal{H} be one of the hyperspaces CL(X), \mathcal{K}(X), \mathcal{F}(X) or \mathcal{F}_n(X) (n a positive integer) with the Vietoris topology. We study the following disconnectedness properties for \mathcal{H}: extremal disconnectedness, being a F^\prime-space, P-space or weak P-space and hereditary disconnectedness. Our main result states: if X is Hausdorff and F\subset X is a closed subset such that (a) both F and X-F are totally disconnected, (b) the quotient X/F is hereditarily disconnected, then \mathcal{K}(X) is hereditarily disconnected. We also show an example proving that this result cannot be reversed.
