Given a Tychonoff space X, let \varrho(X) be the set of remote points of X. We view \varrho(X) as a topological space. In this paper we assume that X is metrizable and ask for conditions on Y so that \varrho(X) is homeomorphic to \varrho(Y). This question has been studied before by R. G. Woods and C. Gates. We give some results of the following type: if X has topological property \mathbf{P} and \varrho(X) is homeomorphic to \varrho(Y), then Y also has \mathbf{P}. We also characterize the remote points of the rationals and irrationals up to some restrictions. Further, we show that \varrho(X) and \varrho(Y) have open dense homeomorphic subspaces if X and Y are both nowhere locally compact, completely metrizable and share the same cellular type, a cardinal invariant we define.
