Let \mathbb{A} denote the Alexandroff-Urysohn double arrow space. We prove the following results: (a) \mathbb{A}\times{}^\omega{2} is not countable dense homogeneous; (b) {}^{\omega}{\mathbb{A}} is not countable dense homogeneous; (c) \mathbb{A} has exactly \mathfrak{c} types of countable dense subsets. These results answer questions by Arhangel'ski\u\i, Hru\v{s}\'ak and van Mill.
