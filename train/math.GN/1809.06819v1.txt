We show that all sufficiently nice \lambda-sets are countable dense homogeneous (\mathsf{CDH}). From this fact we conclude that for every uncountable cardinal \kappa \le \mathfrak{b} there is a countable dense homogeneous metric space of size \kappa. Moreover, the existence of a meager in itself countable dense homogeneous metric space of size \kappa is equivalent to the existence of a \lambda-set of size \kappa. On the other hand, it is consistent with the continuum arbitrarily large that every \mathsf{CDH} metric space has size either \omega_1 or size \mathfrak c. An example of a Baire \mathsf{CDH} metric space which is not completely metrizable is presented. Finally, answering a question of Arhangel'skii and van Mill we show that that there is a compact non-metrizable \mathsf{CDH} space in ZFC.
