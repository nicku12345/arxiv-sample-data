For a given continuum X and a natural number n, we consider the hyperspace F_n(X) of all nonempty subsets of X with at most n points, metrized by the Hausdorff metric. In this paper we show that if X is a dendrite whose set of end points is closed, n \in \mathbb{N} and Y is a continuum such that the hyperspaces F_n(X) and F_n(Y) are homeomorphic, then Y is a dendrite whose set of end points is closed.
