The famous Rosenthal-Lacey theorem asserts that for each infinite compact space K the Banach space C(K) admits a quotient which is either a copy of c_{0} or \ell_{2}. The aim of the paper is to study a natural variant of this result for the space C_{p}(K) of continuous real-valued maps on K with the pointwise topology. Following famous Josefson-Nissenzweig theorem for infinite-dimensional Banach spaces we introduce a corresponding property (called Josefson-Nissenzweig property, briefly, the JNP) for C_{p}-spaces. We prove: For a Tychonoff space X the space C_p(X) satisfies the JNP if and only if C_p(X) has a quotient isomorphic to c_{0} (with the product topology of \mathbb R^\mathbb{N}) if and only if C_{p}(X) contains a complemented subspace, isomorphic to c_0. For a pseudocompact space X the space C_p(X) has the JNP if and only if C_p(X) has a complemented metrizable infinite-dimensional subspace. This applies to show that for a Tychonoff space X the space C_p(X) has a complemented subspace isomorphic to \mathbb R^{\mathbb N} or c_0 if and only if X is not pseudocompact or C_p(X) has the JNP. The space C_{p}(\beta\mathbb{N}) contains a subspace isomorphic to c_0 and admits a quotient isomorphic to \ell_{\infty} but fails to have a quotient isomorphic to c_{0}. An example of a compact space K without infinite convergent sequences with C_{p}(K) containing a complemented subspace isomorphic to c_{0} is constructed.
