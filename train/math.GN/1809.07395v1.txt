In this paper we will prove that all the elements in the smallest ideal K(\betaN) in the semigroup of the Stone Cech compactification (\betaN,.) of the discrete semigroup of natural numbers N under multiplication constitute a single equivalence class under the mid extension divisibility relation. And all the elements in the closure of the smallest ideal Cl(\betaN) constitute a single equivalence class under the tilde extension divisibility relation.
