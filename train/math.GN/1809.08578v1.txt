We extend Exel's ample tight groupoid construction to general locally compact \'etale groupoids in the Hausdorff case. Moreover, we show how inverse semigroups are represented in this way as 'pseudobases' of open bisections, thus yielding a duality which encompasses various extensions of the classic Stone duality.
