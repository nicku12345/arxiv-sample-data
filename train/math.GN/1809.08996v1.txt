Impulsive noise is a problem encountered during the acquisition and transmission of digital images. Fuzzy metrics dealing nicely with the nonlinear nature of digital images are used in vector median-based filters for noise reduction in colour and multichannel images. In this paper, We generalize the concept of Fuzzy metric space (In the sense of George and Veeramani) and introduce the notion of Generalized Fuzzy n-Metric Space. The theory for such spaces is developed and as practical application, we propose some new filters based on these Generalized fuzzy metrics for colour image processing.
