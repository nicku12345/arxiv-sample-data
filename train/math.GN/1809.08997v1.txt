G\"ahler ([3],[4]) introduced the concept of 2-metric as a possible generalization of usual notion of a metric space. In many cases the results obtained in the usual metric spaces and 2-metric spaces are found to be unrelated (see [5]). Mustafa and Sims [8] took a different approach and introduced the notion of G-metric. The author [6] generalized the notion of G-metric to more than three variables and introduced the concept of K-metric as a function K\colon X^n \to \mathbb{R}^+, (n\ge 3). In this paper, We improve the definition of K-metric by making symmetry condition more general. This improved metric denoted by G_n is called the Generalized n-metric. We develop the theory for generalized n-metric spaces and obtain some fixed point theorems.
