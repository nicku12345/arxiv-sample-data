For the algebraic convergence \lambda_{\mathrm{s}}, which generates the well known sequential topology \tau_s on a complete Boolean algebra {\mathbb B}, we have \lambda_{\mathrm{s}}=\lambda_{\mathrm{ls}}\cap \lambda_{\mathrm{li}}, where the convergences \lambda_{\mathrm{ls}} and \lambda_{\mathrm{li}} are defined by \lambda_{\mathrm{ls}}(x)=\{ \limsup x\}\!\uparrow and \lambda_{\mathrm{li}}(x)=\{ \liminf x\}\!\downarrow (generalizing the convergence of sequences on the Alexandrov cube and its dual). We consider the minimal topology \mathcal{O}_{\mathrm{lsi}} extending the (unique) sequential topologies \mathcal{O}_{\lambda_{\mathrm{ls}}} (left) and \mathcal{O}_{\lambda_{\mathrm{li}}} (right) generated by the convergences \lambda_{\mathrm{ls}} and \lambda_{\mathrm{li}} and establish a general hierarchy between all these topologies and the corresponding a priori and a posteriori convergences. In addition, we observe some special classes of algebras and, in particular, show that in (\omega,2)-distributive algebras we have \lim_{{\mathcal O}_{\mathrm{lsi}}}=\lim_{\tau _{\mathrm{s}} }=\lambda _{\mathrm{s}}, while the equality \mathcal{O}_{\mathrm{lsi}}=\tau_s holds in all Maharam algebras. On the other hand, in some collapsing algebras we have a maximal (possible) diversity.
