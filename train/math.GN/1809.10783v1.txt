Often, a given selection game studied in the literature has a known dual game. In dual games, a winning strategy for a player in either game may be used to create a winning strategy for the opponent in the dual. For example, the Rothberger selection game involving open covers is dual to the point-open game. This extends to a general theorem: if \{\operatorname{ran}{f}:f\in\mathbf C(\mathcal R)\} is coinitial in \mathcal A with respect to \subseteq, where \mathbf C(\mathcal R)=\{f\in(\bigcup\mathcal R)^{\mathcal R}:R\in\mathcal R\Rightarrow f(R)\in R\} collects the choice functions on the set \mathcal R, then G_1(\mathcal A,\mathcal B) and G_1(\mathcal R,\neg\mathcal B) are dual selection games.
