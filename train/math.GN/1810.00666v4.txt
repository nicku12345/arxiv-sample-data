A polynomial knot in \mathbb{R}^n is a smooth embedding of \mathbb{R} in \mathbb{R}^n such that the component functions are real polynomials. In the earlier paper with Mishra, we have studied the space \mathcal{P} of polynomial knots in \mathbb{R}^3 with the inductive limit topology coming from the spaces \mathcal{O}_d for d\geq3, where \mathcal{O}_d is the space of polynomial knots in \mathbb{R}^3 with degree d and having some conditions on the degrees of the component polynomials. In the same paper, we have proved that the space of polynomial knots in \mathbb{R}^3 has the same homotopy type as S^2. The homotopy type of the space is the mere consequence of the topology chosen. If we have another topology on \mathcal{P}, the homotopy type may change. With this in mind, we consider in general the set \mathcal{L}^n of polynomial knots in \mathbb{R}^n with various topologies on it and study the homotopy type of the respective spaces. Let \mathcal{L} be the union of the sets \mathcal{L}^n for n\geq1. We also explore the homotopy type of the space \mathcal{L} with some natural topologies on it.
