Given a family of continuous real functions \mathcal{G}, let R_\mathcal{G} be a binary relation defined as follows: a continuous function f\colon\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R} is in the relation with a closed set E\subseteq\mathbb{R} if and only if there exists g\in\mathcal{G} such that f\upharpoonright E = g\upharpoonright E. We consider a Galois connection between families of continuous functions and hereditary families of closed sets of reals naturally associated to R_\mathcal{G}. We study complete lattices determined by this connection and prove several results showing the dependence of the properties of these lattices on the properties of \mathcal{G}. In some special cases we obtain exact description of these lattices.
