In the following text we compute possible heights of \mathbb A (Alexandroff square), \mathbb O (unit square [0,1]\times[0,1] with lexicographic order topology) and \mathbb U (unit square [0,1]\times[0,1] with induced topology of Euclidean plane). We prove P_h(\mathbb{A})=\{n:n\geq5\}\cup\{+\infty\}, P_h(\mathbb{O})=\{n:n\geq4\}\cup\{+\infty\}, P_h(\mathbb{U})=\{n:n\geq1\}\cup\{+\infty\} (where for topological space X, by P_h(X) we mean the collection of heights of transformation groups with phase space X. In this way we also prove that there is not any topological transitive (resp. Devaney chaotic) Alexandroff square transformation group.
