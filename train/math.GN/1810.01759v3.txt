The tail of a quantum spin network in the two-sphere is a q-series associated to the network. We study the existence of the head and tail functions of quantum spin networks colored by 2n. We compute the q-series for an infinite family of quantum spin networks and give the relation between the tail of these networks and the tail of the colored Jones polynomial. Finally, we show that the family of quantum spin networks under study satisfies a natural product structure, making these networks satisfy a natural product structure.
