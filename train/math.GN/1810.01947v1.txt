The first part of the paper is a brief overview of Hindman's finite sums theorem, its prehistory and a few of its further generalizations, and a modern technique used in proving these and similar results, which is based on idempotent ultrafilters in ultrafilter extensions of semigroups. The second, main part of the paper is devoted to the topologizability problem of a wide class of algebraic structures called polyrings; this class includes Abelian groups, rings, modules, algebras over a ring, differential rings, and others. We show that the Zariski topology on such an algebra is always non-discrete. Actually, a much stronger fact holds: if K is an infinite polyring, n a natural number, and a map F of K^n into K is defined by a term in n variables, then F is a closed nowhere dense subset of the space K^{n+1} with its Zariski topology. In particular, K^n is a closed nowhere dense subset of K^{n+1}. The proof essentially uses a multidimensional version of Hindman's finite sums theorem established by Bergelson and Hindman. The third part of the paper lists several problems concerning topologization of various algebraic structures, their Zariski topologies, and some related questions.   This paper is an extended version of the lecture at Journ\'ees sur les Arithm\'etiques Faibles 36: \`a l'occasion du 70\`eme anniversaire de Yuri Matiyasevich, delivered on 7th July, 2017, in Saint Petersburg.
