For a Tychonoff space X and a family \lambda of subsets of X, we denote by C_{\lambda}(X) the T_1-space of all real-valued continuous functions on X with the \lambda -open topology. A topological space is productively Lindel\"of if its product with every Lindel\"of space is Lindel\"of. A space is indestructibly productively Lindel\"of if it is productively Lindel\"of in any extension by countably closed forcing. In this paper, we study indestructibly productively Lindel\"of and Menger function space C_{\lambda}(X).
