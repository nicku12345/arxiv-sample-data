Here we have studied on the ideas of g_{\mu_i} and \lambda_{\mu_i}-closed sets with respect to {\mu_j}(i,j=1,2,i\not=j) and pairwise  \lambda -closed sets in a generalized bitopological space  (X,\mu_1, \mu_2) . We have also investigated the properties on some new separation axioms namely pairwise  T_\frac{1}{4}, pairwise T_\frac{3}{8}, pairwise  T_\frac{5}{8}  and have established their mutual relations with pairwise  T_0 , pairwise  T_\frac{1}{2}  and pairwise  T_1 . We have also shown that under certain conditions these axioms are equivalent.
