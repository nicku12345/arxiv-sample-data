We study spherical completeness of ball spaces and its stability under expansions. We introduce the notion of an ultra-diameter, mimicking diameters in ultrametric spaces. We prove some positive results on preservation of spherical completeness involving ultra-diameters with values in narrow partially ordered sets. Finally, we show that in general, chain intersection closures of ultrametric spaces with partially ordered value sets do not preserve spherical completeness.
