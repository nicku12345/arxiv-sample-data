We study concentration of measure in Lie group actions. Using Macdonald's formula, we calculate "the concentration locus", which is a tool to detect whether a sequence of open sets concentrates the measure. We exhibit cases in which this concentration locus is significantly different from the one calculated for spheres in the pioneering work of Levy. Some examples of infinite group action on an infinite dimensional compact and non compact manifold show the role played by the trajectory of concentration locus. We also provide some applications in Physics, which emphasize the role of concentration of measure in gravitational effects.
