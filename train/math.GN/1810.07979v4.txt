By a ballean we understand a set X endowed with a family of entourages which is a base of some coarse structure on X. Given two unbounded ballean X,Y with normal product X\times Y, we prove that the balleans X,Y have bounded growth and the bornology of X\times Y has a linearly ordered base. A ballean (X,\mathcal E_X) is defined to have bounded growth if there exists a function G assigning to each point x\in X a bounded subset G[x]\subset X so that for any bounded set B\subset X the union \bigcup_{x\in B}G[x] is bounded and for any entourage E\in\mathcal E_X there exists a bounded set B\subset X such that E[x]\subset G[x] for all x\in X\setminus B. We prove that the product X\times Y of two balleans has bounded growth if and only if X and Y have bounded growth and the bornology of the product X\times Y has a linearly ordered base. Also we prove that a ballean X has bounded growth (and the bornology of X has a linearly ordered base) if its symmetric square [X]^{\le 2} is normal (and the ballean X is not ultranormal). A ballean X has bounded growth and its bornology has a linearly ordered base if for some n\ge 3 and some subgroup G\subset S_n the G-symmetric n-th power [X]^n_G of X is normal. On the other hand, we prove that for any ultranormal discrete ballean X and every n\ge 2 the power X^n is not normal but the hypersymmetric power [X]^{\le n} of X is normal. Also we prove that the finitary ballean of a group is normal if and only if it has bounded growth if and only if the group is countable.
