In this paper we investigate graph inverse semigroups which are subsemigroups of compact-like topological semigroups. More precisely, we characterise graph inverse semigroups which admit a compact semigroup topology and describe graph inverse semigroups which can be embeded densely into CLP-compact topological semigroups.
