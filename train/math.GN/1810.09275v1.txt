Spherically complete ball spaces provide a framework for the proof of generic fixed point theorems. For the purpose of their application it is important to have methods for the construction of new spherically complete ball spaces from given ones. Given various ball spaces on the same underlying set, we discuss the construction of new ball spaces through set theoretic operations on the balls. A definition of continuity for functions on ball spaces leads to the notion of quotient spaces. Further, we show the existence of products and coproducts and use this to derive a topological category associated with ball spaces.
