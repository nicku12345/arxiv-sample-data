Hajnal and Juh\'asz proved that if X is a T_1-space, then |X|\le 2^{s(X)\psi(X)}, and if X is a Hausdorff space, then |X|\le 2^{c(X)\chi(X)} and |X|\le 2^{2^{s(X)}}. Schr\"oder sharpened the first two estimations by showing that if X is a Hausdorff space, then |X|\le 2^{Us(X)\psi_c(X)}, and if X is a Urysohn space, then |X|\le 2^{Uc(X)\chi(X)}.   In this paper, for any positive integer n and some topological spaces X, we define the cardinal functions \chi_n(X), \psi_n(X), s_n(X), and c_n(X), called respectively S(n)-character, S(n)-pseudocharacter, S(n)-spread, and S(n)-cellularity, and using these new cardinal functions we show that the above-mentioned inequalities could be extended to the class of S(n)-spaces. We recall that the S(1)-spaces are exactly the Hausdorff spaces and the S(2)-spaces are exactly the Urysohn spaces.
