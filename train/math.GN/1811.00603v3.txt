If X is a metric space, then its finite subset spaces X(n) form a nested sequence under natural isometric embeddings X = X(1)\subset X(2) \subset \cdots. It was previously established, by Kovalev when X is a Hilbert space and, by Ba\v{c}\'{a}k and Kovalev when X is a CAT(0) space, that this sequence admits Lipschitz retractions X(n)\rightarrow X(n-1) for all n\geq 2. We prove that when X is a normed space, the above sequence admits Lipschitz retractions X(n)\rightarrow X, X(n)\rightarrow X(2), as well as concrete retractions X(n)\rightarrow X(n-1) that are Lipschitz if n=2,3 and H\"older-continuous on bounded sets if n>3. We also prove that if X is a geodesic metric space, then each X(n) is a 2-quasiconvex metric space. These results are relevant to certain questions in the aforementioned previous work which asked whether Lipschitz retractions X(n)\rightarrow X(n-1), n\geq 2, exist for X in more general classes of Banach spaces.
