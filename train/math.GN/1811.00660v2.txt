A space X is said to be "cellular-Lindel\"of" if for every cellular family \mathcal{U} there is a Lindel\"of subspace L of X which meets every element of \mathcal{U}. Cellular-Lindel\"of spaces generalize both Lindel\"of spaces and spaces with the countable chain condition. Solving questions of Xuan and Song, we prove that every cellular-Lindel\"of monotonically normal space is Lindel\"of and that every cellular-Lindel\"of space with a regular G_\delta-diagonal has cardinality at most 2^\mathfrak{c}. We also prove that every normal cellular-Lindel\"of first-countable space has cardinality at most continuum under 2^{<\mathfrak{c}}=\mathfrak{c} and that every normal cellular Lindel\"of space with a G_\delta-diagonal of rank 2 has cardinality at most continuum.
