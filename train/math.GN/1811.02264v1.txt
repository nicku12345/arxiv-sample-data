The depth of a topological space X (g(X)) is defined as the supremum of the cardinalities of closures of discrete subsets of X. Solving a problem of Mart\'inez-Ruiz, Ram\'irez-P\'aramo and Romero-Morales, we prove that the cardinal inequality |X| \leq g(X)^{L(X) \cdot F(X)} holds for every Hausdorff space X, where L(X) is the Lindel\"of number of X and F(X) is the supremum of the cardinalities of the free sequences in X.
