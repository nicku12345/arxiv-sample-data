We solve two questions regarding spaces with a (G_\delta)-diagonal of rank 2. One is a question of Basile, Bella and Ridderbos regarding weakly Lindel\"of spaces with a G_\delta-diagonal of rank 2 and the other is a question of Arhangel'skii and Bella asking whether every space with a diagonal of rank 2 and cellularity continuum has cardinality at most continuum.
