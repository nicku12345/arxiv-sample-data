We introduce a two-parameters bt-algebra which, by specialization, becomes the one-parameter bt-algebra, introduced by the authors, as well as another one-parameter presentation of it; the invariant for links and tied links, associated to this two-parameter algebra via Jones recipe, contains as specializations the invariants obtained from these two presentations of the bt-algebra and then is more powerful than each of them. Also, a new non Homflypt polynomial invariant is obtained for links, which is related to the linking matrix.
