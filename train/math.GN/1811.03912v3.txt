It is shown that, assuming the Continuum Hypothesis, compact Hausdorff space of weight at most \mathfrak{c} is a remainder in a soft compactification of \mathbb{N}. We also exhibit an example of a compact space of weight \aleph_1 -- hence a remainder in some compactification of \mathbb{N} -- for which it is consistent that is not the remainder in a soft compactification of \mathbb{N}.
