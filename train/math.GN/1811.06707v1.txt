The main object of this paper is to study the concept of weak I^K-convergence, a generalization of weak I^*-convergence of sequences in a normed space, introducing the idea of weak* I^K-convergence of sequences of functionals where I,K are two ideals on \mathbb{N}, the set of all positive integers. Also we have studied the ideas of weak I^K and weak* I^K-limit points to investigate the properties in the same space.
