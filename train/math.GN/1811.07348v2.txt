We survey Ozsv\'ath-Szab\'o's bordered approach to knot Floer homology. After a quick introduction to knot Floer homology, we introduce the relevant algebraic concepts (\mathcal{A}_\infty-modules, type D-structures, box tensor, etc.), we discuss partial Kauffman states, the construction of the boundary algebra, and sketch Ozsv\'ath and Szab\'o's analytic construction of the type D-structure associated to an upper diagram. Finally we give an explicit description of the structure maps of the DA-bimodules of some elementary partial diagrams. These can be used to perform explicit computations of the knot Floer differential of any knot in S^3. The boundary DGAs \mathcal{B}(n,k) and \mathcal{A}(n,k) of [7] are replaced here by an associative algebra \mathcal{C}(n). These are the notes of two lecture series delivered by Peter Ozsv\'ath and Zolt\'an Szab\'o at Princeton University during the summer of 2018.
