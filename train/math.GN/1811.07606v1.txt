This paper introduces the ring of all real valued Baire one functions, denoted by B_1(X) and also the ring of all real valued bounded Baire one functions, denoted by B_1^*(X). Though the resemblance between C(X) and B_1(X) is the focal theme of this paper, it is observed that unlike C(X) and C^*(X) (real valued bounded continuous functions), B_1^*(X) is a proper subclass of B_1(X) in almost every non-trivial situation. Introducing B_1-embedding and B_1^*-embedding, several analogous results, especially, an analogue of Urysohn's extension theorem is established.
