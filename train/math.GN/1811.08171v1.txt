A subgroup G of a product \prod\limits_{i\in\mathbb{N}}G_i is \emph{rectangular} if there are subgroups H_i of G_i such that G=\prod\limits_{i\in\mathbb{N}}H_i. We say that G is \emph{weakly rectangular} if there are finite subsets F_i\subseteq \mathbb{N} and subgroups H_i of \bigoplus\limits_{j\in F_i} G_j that satisfy G=\prod\limits_{i\in\mathbb{N}}H_i. %We say that G is a \emph{subdirect product} of the family \{G_i\}_{i\in I} if G is weakly rectangular and %G\cap\bigoplus\limits_{i\in I} G_i=\bigoplus\limits_{i\in\mathbb{N}}H_i. In this paper we discuss when a closed subgroup of a product is weakly rectangular. Some possible applications to the theory of group codes are also highlighted.
