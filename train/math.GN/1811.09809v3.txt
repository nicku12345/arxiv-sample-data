First, we provide a new representation of dimension n for Artin braid group B_n. This representation is not faithful, as we will show. But it is easily defined, and captures the fundamental interactions of the strands in braids, i.e., over-crossings, under-crossings or no-crossings. Next, we introduce a more general n-dimensional representation for B_n, which includes the first representation as a very special case. Moreover, as another special case it also includes the unreduced Burau representation.
