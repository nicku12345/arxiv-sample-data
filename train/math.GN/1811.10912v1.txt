Let G be a metric group and let \sA ut(G) denote the automorphism group of G. If \sA and \sB are groups of G-valued maps defined on the sets X and Y, respectively, we say that \sA and \sB are \emph{equivalent} if there is a group isomorphism H\colon\sA\to\sB such that there is a bijective map h\colon Y\to X and a map w\colon Y\to \sA ut (G) satisfying Hf(y)=w[y](f(h(y))) for all y\in Y and f\in \sA. In this case, we say that H is represented as a \emph{weighted composition operator}. A group isomorphism H defined between \sA and \sB is called \emph{separating} when for each pair of maps f,g\in \sA satisfying that f^{-1}(e_G)\cup g^{-1}(e_G)=X, it holds that (Hf)^{-1}(e_G)\cup (Hg)^{-1}(e_G)=Y. Our main result establishes that under some mild conditions, every separating group isomorphism can be represented as a weighted composition operator. As a consequence we establish the equivalence of two function groups if there is a biseparating isomorphism defined between them.
