We prove several rigidity results for corona \mathrm{C}^*-algebras and \v{C}ech-Stone remainders under the assumption of Forcing Axioms. In particular, we prove that a strong version of Todor\v{c}evi\'c's OCA and Martin's Axiom at level \aleph_1 imply: (i) that if X and Y are locally compact second countable topological spaces, then all homeomorphisms between \beta X\setminus X and \beta Y\setminus Y are induced by homeomorphisms between cocompact subspaces of X and Y; (ii) that all automorphisms of the corona algebra of a separable \mathrm{C}^*-algebra are trivial in the sense of Coskey and Farah; (iii) that if A is a unital separable infinite-dimensional \mathrm{C}^*-algebra, the corona algebra of A\otimes \mathcal K(H) does not embed into the Calkin algebra. All these results do not hold under the Continuum Hypothesis.
