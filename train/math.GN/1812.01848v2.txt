A vector balleans is a vector space over \mathbb{R} endowed with a coarse structure in such a way that the vector operations are coarse mappings. We prove that, for every ballean (X, \mathcal{E}), there exists the unique free vector ballean \mathbb{V}(X, \mathcal{E}) and describe the coarse structure of \mathbb{V}(X, \mathcal{E}). It is shown that normality of \mathbb{V}(X, \mathcal{E}) is equivalent to metrizability of (X, \mathcal{E}).
