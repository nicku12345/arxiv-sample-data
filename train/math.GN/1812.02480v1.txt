Given a collection of pairwise co-prime integers % m_{1},\ldots ,m_{r}, greater than 1, we consider the product \Sigma =\Sigma _{m_{1}}\times \cdots \times \Sigma _{m_{r}}, where each \Sigma _{m_{i}} is the m_{i}-adic solenoid. Answering a question of D. P. Bellamy and J. M. \L ysko, in this paper we prove that if M is a subcontinuum of \Sigma  such that the projections of M on each \Sigma _{m_{i}} are onto, then for each open subset U in \Sigma  with M\subset U, there exists an open connected subset V of \Sigma  such that M\subset V\subset U; i.e. any such M is ample in the sense of Prajs and Whittington [10]. This contrasts with the property of Cartesian squares of fixed solenoids \Sigma _{m_{i}}\times   \Sigma _{m_{i}}, whose diagonals are never ample [1].
