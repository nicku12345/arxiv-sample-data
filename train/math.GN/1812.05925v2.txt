Let \mathcal{P} be a topological property. A.V. Arhangel'skii calls X projectively \mathcal{P} if every second countable continuous image of X is \mathcal{P}. Lj.D.R. Ko\check{c}inac characterized the classical covering properties of Menger, Rothberger, Hurewicz and Gerlits-Nagy in term of continuous images in \mathbb{R}^{\omega}. In this paper we study the functional characterizations of all projective versions of the selection properties in the Scheepers Diagram.
