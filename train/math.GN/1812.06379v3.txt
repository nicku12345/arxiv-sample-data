In 2017, Tkachuk isolated the closed discrete selection property while working on problems related to function spaces [15]. In this paper we will study the closed discrete selection property and the related games and strategies on C_k(X). Clontz and Holshouser showed previously that the closed discrete selection game on C_p(X) is equivalent to a modification of the point-open game on X. In this paper we show that the closed discrete selection game on C_k(X) is equivalent to a modification of the compact-open game on X. We also connect discrete selection properties on C_k(X) to a variety of other properties on X, C_k(X), and hyperspaces of X.
