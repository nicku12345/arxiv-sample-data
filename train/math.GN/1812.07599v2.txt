Gelfand-Naimark-Stone duality establishes a dual equivalence between the category {\sf KHaus} of compact Hausdorff spaces and the category {\boldsymbol{\mathit{uba}\ell}} of uniformly complete bounded archimedean \ell-algebras. We extend this duality to the category {\sf CReg} of completely regular spaces. This we do by first introducing basic extensions of bounded archimedean \ell-algebras and generalizing Gelfand-Naimark-Stone duality to a dual equivalence between the category {\boldsymbol{\mathit{ubasic}}} of uniformly complete basic extensions and the category {\sf C} of compactifications of completely regular spaces. We then introduce maximal basic extensions and prove that the subcategory {\boldsymbol{\mathit{mbasic}}} of {\boldsymbol{\mathit{ubasic}}} consisting of maximal basic extensions is dually equivalent to the subcategory {\sf SComp} of {\sf Comp} consisting of Stone-\v{C}ech compactifications. This yields the desired dual equivalence for completely regular spaces since {\sf CReg} is equivalent to {\sf SComp}.
