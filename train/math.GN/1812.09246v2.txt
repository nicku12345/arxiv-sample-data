We prove that all Sierpi\'nski spaces in {\mathbb{S}}^n, n\geq 2, are non-removable for (quasi)conformal maps, generalizing the result of the first named author arXiv:1809.05605. More precisely, we show that for any Sierpi\'nski space X\subset \mathbb{S}^n there exists a homeomorphism f\colon \mathbb{S}^n\to \mathbb{S}^n, conformal in \mathbb{S}^n\setminus X, that maps X to a set of positive measure and is not globally (quasi)conformal. This is the first class of examples of non-removable sets in higher dimensions.
