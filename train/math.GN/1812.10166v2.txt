A topological space X is \kappa-Fr\'{e}chet--Urysohn if for every open subset U of X and every x\in \overline{U} there exists a sequence in  U converging to x. We prove that every \kappa-Fr\'{e}chet--Urysohn Tychonoff space X is Ascoli. We apply this statement and some of known results to characterize the \kappa-Fr\'echet--Urysohn property in various important classes of locally convex spaces. In particular, answering a question posed in [7] we obtain that C_p(X) is Ascoli iff X has the property (\kappa).
