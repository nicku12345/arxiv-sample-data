The purpose of this paper is to generalize the measure of non-compactness for the space of continuous functions over the T_{3 \frac{1}{2}} space. Motivated by the generalized Arzel\`a-Ascoli theorem for Tichonoff space T via Wallman compactifiaction \operatorname{Wall}(T), we constuct a measure of non-compactness for the space C^b(T). We also study some of the properties of this object and give another version of Darbo-type theorem, suitable for this particular case.
