This paper presents the geometrical representation of the load demand by using orbits diagrams in the Mandelbrot set, to identify changing behaviors during a day period of the real and reactive powers. To perform this, different power combinations were used to represent the fractal diagrams with an algorithm that considers the mathematical model of Mandelbrot set and orbits diagrams. A qualitative analysis of the orbits is performed to identify the fractal graphic patterns with respect to the real and reactive power consumptions. The results show repetitive graphic patterns in the fractal space of the power consumption during the day, which help represent the consumption behavior on a daily load demand curve. The orbit diagrams save form and structure relations during the daily behavior of the power consumption. This work shows a different method of evaluating load demand behavior by using orbit diagrams as a potential tool that will lead to identify load behavior, useful in operational decisions and power system planning.
