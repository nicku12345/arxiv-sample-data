The notion of hull-kernel topology on a collection of prime filters in a residuated lattice is introduced and investigated. It is observed that any collection of prime filters is a T_0 topological space under the hull-kernel and the dual hull-kernel topologies. It is proved that any collection of prime filters is a T_1 space if and only if it is an antichain, and it is a Hausdorff space if and only if it satisfies a certain condition. Some characterizations in which maximal filters forms a Hausdorff space are given. At the end, it is focused on the space of minimal prim filters, and it is shown that this space is a totally disconnected Hausdorff space. This paper is closed by a discussion abut the various forms of compactness and connectedness of this space.
