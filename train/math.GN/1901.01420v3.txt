We present several known and new results on the Baire category properties in topological groups. In particular, we prove that a Baire topological group X is metrizable if and only if X is point-cosmic if and only if X is a \sigma-space. A topological group X is Choquet if and only if its Raikov completion \bar X is Choquet and X is G_\delta-dense in \bar X. A topological group X is complete-metrizable if and only if X is a point-cosmic Choquet space if and only if X is a Choquet \sigma-space. Finally, we pose several open problem, in particular, if each Choquet topological group is strong Choquet.
