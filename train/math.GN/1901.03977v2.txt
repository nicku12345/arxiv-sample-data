A ballean (or coarse space) is a set endowed with a coarse structure. A ballean X is called normal if any two asymptotically disjoint subsets of X are asymptotically separated. We say that a ballean X is ultranormal (extremely normal) if any two unbounded subsets of X are not asymptotically disjoint (every unbounded subset of X is large). Every maximal ballean is extremely normal and every extremely normal ballean is ultranormal, but the converse statements do not hold. A normal ballean is ultranormal if and only if the Higson^{\prime}s corona of X is a singleton. A discrete ballean X is ultranormal if and only if X is maximal. We construct a series of concrete balleans with extremal properties.
