The weak tightness wt(X) of a space X was introduced in [11] with the property wt(X)\leq t(X). We investigate several well-known results concerning t(X) and consider whether they extend to the weak tightness setting. First we give an example of a non-sequential compactum X such that wt(X)=\aleph_0<t(X) under 2^{\aleph_0}=2^{\aleph_1}. In particular, this demonstrates the celebrated Balogh's Theorem [5] does not hold in general if countably tight is replaced with weakly countably tight. Second, we introduce the notion of an S-free sequence and show that if X is a homogeneous compactum then |X|\leq 2^{wt(X)\pi_\chi(X)}. This refines a theorem of De la Vega [12]. In the case where the cardinal invariants involved are countable, this also represents a variation of a theorem of Juh\'asz and van Mill [15]. Third, we show that if X is a T_1 space, wt(X)\leq\kappa, X is \kappa^+-compact, and \psi(\overline{D},X)\leq 2^\kappa for any D\subseteq X satisfying |D|\leq 2^\kappa, then a) d(X)\leq 2^\kappa and b) X has at most 2^\kappa-many G_\kappa-points. This is a variation of another theorem of Balogh [6]. Finally, we show that if X is a regular space, \kappa=L(X)wt(X), and \lambda is a caliber of X satisfying \kappa<\lambda\leq \left(2^{\kappa}\right)^+, then d(X)\leq 2^{\kappa}. This extends of theorem of Arhangel'skii [3].
