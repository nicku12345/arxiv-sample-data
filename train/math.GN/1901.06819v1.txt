We prove that if X is a paracompact space, Y is a metric space and f:X\to Y is a functionally fragmented map, then (i) f is \sigma-discrete and functionally F_\sigma-measurable; (ii) f is a Baire-one function, if Y is weak adhesive and weak locally adhesive for X; (iii) f is countably functionally fragmented, if X is Lindel\"{o}ff.   This result generalizes one theorem of Rene Baire on classification of barely continuous functions.
