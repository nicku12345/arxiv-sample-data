We present a new variation of the classical selection principles \mathsf{S}_\mathrm{k}(\mathcal A, \mathcal B) (k\in\mathbb N) and \mathsf{S}_\mathrm{fin}(\mathcal A, \mathcal B) that formally lies between these two properties. As in the case of the classical selection principles, we also obtain a new variation of topological games and discuss how new topological properties may emerge in the specific cases of covering and tightness.
