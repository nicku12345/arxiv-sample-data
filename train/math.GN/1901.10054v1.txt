We prove that the cardinality of transitive quasi-uniformities in a quasi-proximity class is at least 2^{2^{\aleph_0}} if there exist at least two transitive quasi-uniformities in the class. The transitive elements of \pi(\delta) are characterized if {\cal V}_{\delta} is transitive, and in this case we give a condition when there exists a unique transitive quasi-uniformity in \pi(\delta).
