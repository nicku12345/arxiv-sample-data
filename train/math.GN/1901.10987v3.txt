A topological space X is cometrizable if it admits a weaker metrizable topology such that each point x\in X has a (not necessarily open) neighborhood base consisting of metrically closed sets. We study the relation of cometrizable spaces to other generalized metric spaces and prove that all \mathsf{as}-cosmic spaces are cometrizable. Also, we present an example of a regular countable space of weight \omega_1, which is not cometrizable. Under \omega_1=\mathfrak c this space contains no infinite compact subsets and hence is \mathsf{cs}-cosmic. Under \omega_1<\mathfrak p this countable space is Fr\'echet-Urysohn and is not \mathsf{cs}-cosmic.
