We study the space of ends of groups. For a finitely generated group, this is a Cantor space as soon as it is infinite. In contrast, we show that for infinitely generated countable groups, it exhibits several behaviors. For instance, we show that for the free product Z*Q, it is a Cantor space, while for a free group of infinite rank, it is not metrizable. For arbitrary countable groups, we actually establish an alternative: the space of ends is either metrizable, or has a continuous map onto the Stone-Cech compactification of N. We also show that the space of ends of a countable group has a continuous map onto the Stone-Cech boundary of N if and only if the group is infinite locally finite, and that otherwise it is separable. For arbitrary groups, we also prove that the space of ends, if infinite, has no isolated point.   We also consider these questions for locally compact groups; for instance we extend Holt's theorem by showing that non-sigma-compact regionally elliptic groups are 1-ended.
