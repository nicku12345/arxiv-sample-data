In this work, we Extend Pawlak approximation spaces by topological spaces. Also, Rough Membership, equality and inclusion relations are extended using topological near open sets. In addition, new extended measures of accuracy and quality of approximations are defined and studied. An application example of data reduction of information systems is introduced.
