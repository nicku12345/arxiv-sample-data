A topological measure on a locally compact space is a set function on open and closed subsets which is finitely additive on the collection of open and compact sets, inner regular on open sets, and outer regular on closed sets. Almost all works devoted to topological measures, corresponding non-linear functionals, and their applications deal with compact spaces. The present paper is one in a series that investigates topological measures and corresponding non-linear functionals on locally compact spaces. Here we examine solid and semi-solid sets on a locally compact space. We then give a method of constructing topological measures from solid-set functions on a locally compact, connected, locally connected space. The paper gives examples of finite and infinite topological measures on locally compact, non-compact spaces and presents an easy way to generate topological measures on spaces whose one-point compactification has genus 0 from existing examples of topological measures on compact spaces.
