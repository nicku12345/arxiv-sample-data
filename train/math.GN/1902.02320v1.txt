A sequence (a_{n})  in an Abelian group is called a T-sequence if there exists a Hausdorff group topology on G in which (a_{n})  converges to 0. For a T-sequence (a_{n}) , \tau_{(a_{n}) }  denotes the strongest group topology on G in which (a_{n})  converges to 0. The ideal \mathcal{I}_{(a_{n})}  of all precompact subsets of (G, \tau_{(a_{n}) } ) defines a coarse structure on G with base of entourages \{(x, y): x-y \in P \}, P\in\mathcal{I}_{(a_{n})}.  We prove that asdim \ \ (G, \mathcal{I}_{(a_{n}) }) =\infty  for every non-trivial T-sequence (a_{n}) on G, and the coarse group (G, \mathcal{I}_{(a_{n}) }) has 1 end provided that (a_{n})  generates G. The keypart play asymorphic copies of the Hamming space in (G, \mathcal{I}_{(a_{n})}).
