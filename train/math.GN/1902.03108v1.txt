In this paper, we give and prove two Chatterjea type fixed point theorems on partial b-metric space. We propose an extension to the Banach contraction principle on partial b-metric space which was already presented by Shukla and also study some related results on the completion of a partial metric type space. In particular, we prove a joint Chatterjea-Kannan fixed point theorem. We verify the T-stability of Picard's iteration and conjecture the P property for such maps. We also give examples to illustrate our results.
