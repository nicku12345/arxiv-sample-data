It is obtained a natural generalisation of Uspenskij's selection characterisation of paracompact C-spaces. The method developed to achieve this result is also applied to give a simplified proof of a similar characterisation of paracompact finite C-space obtained previously by Valov. Another application is a characterisation of finite-dimensional paracompact spaces which generalises both a remark done by Michael and a result obtained by the author.
