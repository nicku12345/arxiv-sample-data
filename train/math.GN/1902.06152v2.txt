Call a compact space X pin homogeneous if every two points a,b are pin equivalent, meaning that there exists a compact space Y, a quotient map f\colon Y\to X, and a homeomorphism g\colon Y\to Y such that gf^{-1}\{a\}=f^{-1}\{b\}. We will prove a representation theorem for pin equivalence; transitivity of pin equivalence will be a corollary.   Pin homogeneity is strictly weaker than homogeneity and pin equivalence is strictly stronger than Tukey equivalence. Just as with topological homogeneity, no infinite compact F-space is pin homogeneous. On the other hand, X\times 2^{\chi(X)} is pin homogeneous for every compact X. And there is a compact pin homogeneous space with points of different \pi-character.
