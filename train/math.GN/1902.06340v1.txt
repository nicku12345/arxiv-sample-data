K\"unzi and Ferrario have shown that a T_0 space is sober if and only if it is bicomplete in the well-monotone quasi-uniformity. We prove a pointfree version of this result: a strictly zero-dimensional biframe is a congruence biframe if and only if it is bicomplete in the same quasi-uniformity. As a corollary we obtain a new proof of a result of Plewe that a congruence frame is ultraparacompact. The main result makes use of a new construction of the bicompletion of a quasi-uniform biframe as a quotient of the Samuel compactification.
