A topological space X is strongly D if for any neighbourhood assignment \{U_x:x\in X\}, there is a D\subseteq X such that \{U_x:x\in D\} covers X and D is locally finite in the topology generated by \{U_x:x\in X\}. We prove that \diamondsuit implies that there is an HFC_w space in 2^{\omega_1} (hence 0-dimensional, Hausdorff and hereditarily Lindel\"of) which is not strongly D. We also show that any HFC space X is dually discrete and if additionally, countable sets have Menger closure then X is a D-space.
