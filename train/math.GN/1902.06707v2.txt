The union of a directed family of topological groups can be equipped with two noteworthy topologies: the finest topology making each injection continuous, and the finest group topology making each injection continuous. This begs the question of whether the two topologies coincide. If the family is countable, the answer is well known in many cases. We study this question in the context of so-called long families, which are as far as possible from countable ones. As a first step, we present answers to the question for families of group-valued continuous maps and homeomorphism groups, and provide additional examples.
