The Reeb graph of a function on a smooth manifold is the graph obtained as the space of all connected components of level sets such that the set of all vertices coincides with the set of all connected components of level sets including singular points. Reeb graphs are fundamental and important in the algebraic and differential topological theory of Morse functions and their generalizations.   In this paper, as a related fundamental and important study, for given graphs, we construct certain smooth functions inducing the graphs as the Reeb graphs. Such works have been demonstrated by Masumoto, Michalak, Saeki, Sharko etc. and also by the author since 2000s. We present new smooth functions on suitable 3-dimensional closed orientable manifolds through explicit constructive methods.
