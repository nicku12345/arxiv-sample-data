This paper explores the duality between ideals of the ring B_1(X) of all real valued Baire one functions on a topological space X and typical families of zero sets, called Z_B-filters, on X. As a natural outcome of this study, it is observed that B_1(X) is a Gelfand ring but non-Noetherian in general. Introducing fixed and free maximal ideals in the context of B_1(X), complete descriptions of the fixed maximal ideals of both B_1(X) and B_1^*(X) are obtained. Though free maximal ideals of B_1(X) and those of B_1^*(X) do not show any relationship in general, their counterparts, i.e., the fixed maximal ideals obey natural relations. It is proved here that for a perfectly normal T_1 space X, free maximal ideals of B_1(X) are determined by a typical class of Baire one functions. In the concluding part of this paper, we study residue class ring of B_1(X) modulo an ideal, with special emphasize on real and hyper real maximal ideals of B_1(X).
