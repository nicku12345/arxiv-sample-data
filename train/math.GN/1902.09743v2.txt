We prove versions of Ekeland, Takahashi and Caristi principles in sequentially right K-complete quasi-pseudometric spaces (meaning asymmetric pseudometric spaces), the equivalence between these principles, as well as their equivalence to the completeness of the underlying quasi-pseudometric space.   The key tools are Picard sequences for some special set-valued mappings corresponding to a function \varphi on a quasi-pseudometric space, allowing a unitary treatment of all these principles.
