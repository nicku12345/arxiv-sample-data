We prove that (1) for any complete lattice L, the set \mathcal{D}(L) of all nonempty saturated compact subsets of the Scott space of L is a complete Heyting algebra (with the reverse inclusion order); and (2) if the Scott space of a complete lattice L is non-sober, then the Scott space of \mathcal{D}(L) is non-sober. Using these results and the Isbell's example of a non-sober complete lattice, we deduce that there is a complete Heyting algebra whose Scott space is non-sober, thus give a positive answer to a problem posed by Jung. We will also prove that a T_0 space is well-filtered iff its upper space (the set \mathcal{D}(X) of all nonempty saturated compact subsets of X equipped with the upper Vietoris topology) is well-filtered, which answers another open problem.
