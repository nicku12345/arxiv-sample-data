Functional representations of the capacity monad based on the max and min operations were considered in \cite{Ra1} and \cite{Ny1}. Nykyforchyn considered in \cite{Ny2} some alternative monad structure for the possibility capacity functor based on the max and usual multiplication operations. We show that such capacity monad (which we call the capacity multiplication monad) has a functional representation, i.e. the space of capacities on a compactum X can be naturally embedded (with preserving of the monad structure) in some space of functionals on C(X,I). We also describe this space of functionals in terms of properties of functionals.
