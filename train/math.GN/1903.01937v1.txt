A function f:X\to \mathbb R defined on a topological space X is called returning if for any point x\in X there exists a positive real number M_x such that for every path-connected subset C_x\subset X containing the point x and any y\in C_x\setminus\{x\} there exists a point z\in C_x\setminus\{x,y\} such that |f(z)|\le \max\{M_x,|f(y)|\}. A topological space X is called path-inductive if a subset U\subset X is open if and only if for any path \gamma:[0,1]\to X the preimage \gamma^{-1}(U) is open in [0,1]. The class of path-inductive spaces includes all first-countable locally path-connected spaces and all sequential locally contractible space.   We prove that a function f:X\to \mathbb R defined on a path-inductive space X is continuous if and only of it is returning and has closed graph. This implies that a (weakly) \'Swi\c atkowski function f:\mathbb R\to\mathbb R is continuous if and only if it has closed graph, which answers a problem of Maliszewski, inscibed to Lviv Scottish Book.
