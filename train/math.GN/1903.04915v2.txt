We endow a topological group (G, \tau) with a coarse structure defined by the smallest group ideal S_{\tau}  on G containing all converging sequences with their limits and denote the obtained coarse group by (G, S_{\tau}). If G is discrete then (G, S_{\tau}) is a finitary coarse group studding in Geometric Group Theory. The main result: if a topological abelian group (G, \tau) contains a non-trivial converging sequence then asdim \ (G, S_{\tau})= \infty .
