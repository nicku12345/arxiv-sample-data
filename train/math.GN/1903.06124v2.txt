In 1987, A.V. Pestryakov proved a series of theorems for cardinal functions of the space B_{\alpha}(X) of all real-valued functions of Baire class \alpha (\alpha> 0), and he conjectured that most of these theorems are true for spaces containing all finite linear combinations of characteristic functions of zero-sets in X. In this paper we investigate for which theorems of Pestriakov generalizations are valid. Also we prove some additional propositions for function spaces applying the theory of selection principles.
