Let \Omega be a connected open set in the plane and \gamma: [0,1] \to \overline{\Omega} a path such that \gamma((0,1)) \subset \Omega. We show that the path \gamma can be ``pulled tight'' to a unique shortest path which is homotopic to \gamma, via a homotopy h with endpoints fixed whose intermediate paths h_t, for t \in [0,1), satisfy h_t((0,1)) \subset \Omega. We prove this result even in the case when there is no path of finite Euclidean length homotopic to \gamma under such a homotopy. For this purpose, we offer three other natural, equivalent notions of a ``shortest'' path. This work generalizes previous results for simply connected domains with simple closed curve boundaries.
