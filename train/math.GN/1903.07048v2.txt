We compare several topologies on the Morse boundary \partial_M Y of a \mathrm{CAT(0)} cube complex Y. In particular, we show that the two topologies introduced by Cashen and Mackay are not equal in general and provide a new description of one of them in the language of cube complexes. As a corollary, we obtain a new approach to tackle the question whether the visual topology induces a quasi-isometry-invariant topology on the Morse boundary. This leads to an obstruction to quasi-isometry-invariance in terms of the behaviour of geodesics under quasi-isometries.
