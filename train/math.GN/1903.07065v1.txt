In this paper we establish a criterion for the triviality of the C^1-centralizer for vector fields and flows. In particular we deduce the triviality of the centralizer at homoclinic classes of C^r vector fields (r\ge 1). Furthermore, we show that the set of flows whose C^1-centralizer is trivial include: (i) C^1-generic volume preserving flows, (ii) C^2-generic Hamiltonian flows on a generic and full Lebesgue measure set of energy levels, and (iii) C^1-open set of non-hyperbolic vector fields (that admit a Lorenz attractor). We also provide a criterion for the triviality of the C^0-centralizer of continuous flows.
