We prove that for a stratifiable scattered space X of finite scattered height, the function space C_k(X) endowed with the compact-open topology is Baire if and only if X has the Moving Off Property of Gruenhage and Ma. As a byproduct of the proof we establish many interesting Baire category properties of the function spaces C_k'(X,Y)=\{f\in C_k(X,Y):f(X')\subset\{*_Y\}\}, where X is a topological space, X' is the set of non-isolated points of X, and Y is a topological space with a distinguished point *_Y.
