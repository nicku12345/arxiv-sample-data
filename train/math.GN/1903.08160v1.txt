For a Tychonoff space X, we denote by (C(X), \tau_k, \tau_p) the bitopological space of all real-valued continuous functions on X where \tau_k is the compact-open topology and \tau_p is the topology of pointwise convergence. In papers [5, 6, 13] variations of selective separability and tightness in (C(X), \tau_k, \tau_p) were investigated. In this paper we continued to study the selective properties and the corresponding topological games in the space (C(X), \tau_k, \tau_p).
