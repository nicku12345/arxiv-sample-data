For a Tychonoff space X and a subspace Y\subset\mathbb R, we study Baire category properties of the space C_{\downarrow F}(X,Y) of continuous functions from X to Y, endowed with the Fell hypograph topology. We characterize pairs X,Y for which the function space C_{\downarrow F}(X,Y) is \infty-meager, meager, Baire, Choquet, strong Choquet, (almost) complete-metrizable or (almost) Polish.
