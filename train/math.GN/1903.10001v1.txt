This paper deals with an open problem posed by Jleli and Samet in \cite[\, M.~Jleli and B.~Samet, On a new generalization of metric spaces, J. Fixed Point Theory Appl, 20(3) 2018]{JS1}. In \cite[\, Remark 5.1]{JS1} They asked whether the Cantor's intersection theorem can be extended to \mathcal{F}-metric spaces or not. In this manuscript we give an affirmative answer to this open question. We also show that the notions of compactness, totally boundedness in the setting of \mathcal{F}-metric spaces are equivalent to that of usual metric spaces.
