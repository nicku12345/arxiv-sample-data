A function f:X\to Y between topological spaces is called \sigma-continuous (resp. \bar\sigma-continuous) if there exists a (closed) cover \{X_n\}_{n\in\omega} of X such that for every n\in\omega the restriction f{\restriction}X_n is continuous. By \mathfrak c_\sigma (resp. \mathfrak c_{\bar\sigma}) we denote the largest cardinal \kappa\le\mathfrak c such that every function f:X\to\mathbb R defined on a subset X\subset\mathbb R of cardinality |X|<\kappa is \sigma-continuous (resp. \bar\sigma-continuous). It is clear that \omega_1\le\mathfrak c_{\bar\sigma}\le\mathfrak c_\sigma\le\mathfrak c. We prove that \mathfrak p\le\mathfrak q_0=\mathfrak c_{\bar\sigma}=\min\{\mathfrak c_\sigma,\mathfrak b,\mathfrak q\}\le\mathfrak c_\sigma\le\min\{\mathrm{non}(\mathcal M),\mathrm{non}(\mathcal N)\}. The equality \mathfrak c_{\bar\sigma}=\mathfrak q_0 resolves a problem from the initial version of the paper.
