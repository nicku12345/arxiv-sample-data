A space X is strongly Y-selective (resp., Y-selective) if every lower semicontinuous mapping from Y to the nonempty subsets (resp., nonempty closed subsets) of X has a continuous selection. We also call X (strongly) C-selective if it is (strongly) Y-selective for any countable space Y, and (strongly) L-selective if it is (strongly) (\omega+1)-selective. E. Michael showed that every first countable space is strongly C-selective. We extend this by showing that every W-space in the sense of the second author is strongly C-selective. We also show that every GO-space is C-selective, and that every L-selective space has Arhangel'skii's property \alpha_1. We obtain an example under \mathfrak p=\mathfrak c of a strongly L-selective space that is not C-selective, and we show that it is consistent with and independent of ZFC that a space is strongly L-selective iff it is L-selective and Fr\'echet. Finally, we answer a question of the third author and Junnila by showing that the ordinal space \omega_1 +1 is not self-selective.
