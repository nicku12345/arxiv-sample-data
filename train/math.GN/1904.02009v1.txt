Magill proved that the remainders of two locally compact Hausdorff spaces in their StoneCech compactifications are homeomorphic if and only if the lattices of their Hausdorff compactifications are lattice isomorphic. His construction for compactifications are explicitely discussed through the partitions of their StoneCech compactifications. Partitions in a StoneCech compactification which lead to Hausdorff compactifications are characterized in this article. Embeddings of certain upper semi-lattices of compactifications into lattices of compactifications are constructed.
