The topological method for the reconstruction of dynamics from time series [K. Mischaikow, M. Mrozek, J. Reiss, A. Szymczak. Construction of Symbolic Dynamics from Experimental Time Series, Physical Review Letters, 82 (1999), 1144-1147] is reshaped to improve its range of applicability, particularly in the presence of sparse data and strong expansion. The improvement is based on a multivalued map representation of the data. However, unlike the previous approach, it is not required that the representation has a continuous selector. Instead of a selector, a recently developed new version of Conley index theory for multivalued maps [B. Batko and M. Mrozek. Weak index pairs and the Conley index for discrete multivalued dynamical systems, SIAM J. Applied Dynamical Systems 15 (2016), 1143-1162], [B.Batko. Weak index pairs and the Conley index for discrete multivalued dynamical systems. Part II: properties of the Index, SIAM J. Applied Dynamical Systems 16 (2017), 1587-1617] is used in computations. The existence of a continuous, single-valued generator of the relevant dynamics is guaranteed in the vicinity of the graph of the multivalued map constructed from data. Some numerical examples based on time series derived from the iteration of H\'enon type maps are presented.
