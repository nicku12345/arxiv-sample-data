In this paper we compare the concepts of pseudoradial spaces and the recently defined strongly pseudoradial spaces in the realm of compact spaces. We show that \mathrm{MA}+\mathfrak{c}=\omega_2 implies that there is a compact pseudoradial space that is not strongly pseudoradial. We essentially construct a compact, sequentially compact space X and a continuous function f:X\to\omega_1+1 in such a way that there is no copy of \omega_1+1 in X that maps cofinally under f. We also give some conditions that imply the existence of copies of \omega_1 in spaces. In particular, \mathrm{PFA} implies that compact almost radial spaces of radial character \omega_1 contain many copies of \omega_1.
