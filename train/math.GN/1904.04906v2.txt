In this paper we consider the question of when the space C_p(X) of continuous real-valued functions on X with the pointwise convergence topology is countable dense homogeneous. In particular, we focus on the case when X is countable with a unique non-isolated point \infty. In this case, C_p(X) is countable dense homogeneous if and only if the filter of open neighborhoods of \infty is a non-meager P-filter.
