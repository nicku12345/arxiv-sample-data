In this paper we describe a theory of a cumulative distribution function on a space with an order from a probability measure defined in this space. This distribution function plays a similar role to that played in the classical case. Moreover, we define its pseudo-inverse and study its properties. Those properties will allow us to generate samples of a distribution and give us the chance to calculate integrals with respect to the related probability measure.
