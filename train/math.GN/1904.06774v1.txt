A topological space is called Loeb if the collection of all its non-empty closed sets has a choice function. In this article, in the absence of the axiom of choice, connections between Loeb and sequential spaces are investigated. Among other results, it is proved in \mathbf{ZF} that if \mathbf{X} is a Cantor completely metrizable second-countable space, then \mathbf{X}^{\omega} is Loeb. If a sequential, sequentially locally compact space \mathbf{X} has the property that every infinitely countable family of non-empty closed subsets of \mathbf{X} has a choice function, then the Cartesian product \mathbf{X}\times\mathbf{Y} of \mathbf{X} with any sequential space \mathbf{Y} is sequential. In consequence, it holds true in \mathbf{ZF} that the Cartesian product of a sequential locally countably compact space with any sequential space is sequential. If \mathbb{R} is sequential, then every second-countable compact Hausdorff space is sequential. It is also proved that, in some models of \mathbf{ZF}, a countable product of Cantor completely metrizable second-countable spaces can fail to be Loeb and it is independent of \mathbf{ZF} that every sequential subspace of % \mathbb{R} is Loeb. Some other sentences are shown to be independent of % \mathbf{ZF}. Several open problems are posed, among them, the following question: is \mathbb{R}^{\omega} sequential if \mathbb{R} is sequential?
