The notion of max-min measure is a counterpart of the notion of max-plus measure (Maslov measure or idempotent measure). In this paper we consider the spaces of max-min measures on the compact Hausdorff spaces. It is proved that the obtained functor of max-min measures is isomorphic to the functor of max-plus (idempotent) measures considered by the second-named author. However, it turns out that the monads generated by these functors are not isomorphic.
