Assume hat a functionally Hausdorff space X is a continuous image of a \v{C}ech complete space P with Lindel\"of number l(P)<\mathfrak c. Then the following conditions are equivalent: (i) every compact subset of X is scattered, (ii) for every continuous map f:X\to Y to a functionally Hausdorff space Y the image f(X) has cardinality |f(X)|\le \max\{l(P),\psi(Y)\}, (iii) no continuous map f:X\to[0,1] is surjective. Also we prove the equivalence of the conditions: (a) \omega_1<\mathfrak b, (b) a K-analytic space X (with a unique non-isolated point) is countable if and only if every compact subset of X is countable.
