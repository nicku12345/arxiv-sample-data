In nonstandard analysis, Fehrele's principle is a beautiful criterion for a set to be internal, stating that every galactic halic set is internal. In this note, we use this principle to prove some well-known results in topology, including slight generalisations of the Moore-Osgood theorem and Dini's theorem.
