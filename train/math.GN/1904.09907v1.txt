The \emph{shift map} \sigma is the self-homeomorphism of \omega^* = \beta\omega \setminus \omega induced by the successor function n \mapsto n+1 on \omega. We prove that the isomorphism classes of \sigma and \sigma^{-1} cannot be separated by a Borel set in \mathcal H(\omega^*), the space of all self-homeomorphisms of \omega^* equipped with the compact-open topology.   Van Douwen proved it is consistent for \sigma and \sigma^{-1} not to be isomorphic. Whether it is also consistent for them to be isomorphic is an open problem. The theorem stated above can be thought of as a counterpoint to van Douwen's result: while \sigma and \sigma^{-1} may not be isomorphic, there is no simple topological property that distinguishes them.   As a relatively straightforward consequence of the main theorem, we deduce that \mathsf{OCA}+\mathsf{MA} implies the set of continuous images of \sigma fails to be Borel in \mathcal H(\omega^*). (Here a ``continuous image'' of \sigma is meant in the sense of topological dynamics: any h \in \mathcal H(\omega^*) such that q \circ \sigma = h \circ q for some continuous surjection q: \omega^* \to \omega^*.) This contrasts starkly with a recent theorem of the author showing that under \mathsf{CH}, the continuous images of \sigma form a closed subset of \mathcal H(\omega^*).
