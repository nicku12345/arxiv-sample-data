We first introduce a notion of convex structure in generalized metric spaces, then we introduce tripartite contractions, tripartite semi-contractions, tripartite coincidence points, as well as tripartite best proximity points for a given triple (K;S;T) of nonlinear mappings defined on the union A\cup B\cup C of closed subsets of a generalized metric space. We prove theorems on the existence and convergence of tripartite coincidence-best proximity points.
