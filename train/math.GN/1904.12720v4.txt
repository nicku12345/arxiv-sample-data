We exhibit the first examples of compact orientable hyperbolic manifolds that do not have any spin structure. We show that such manifolds exist in all dimensions n \geq 4. The core of the argument is the construction of a compact orientable hyperbolic 4-manifold M that contains a surface S of genus 3 with self intersection 1. The 4-manifold M has an odd intersection form and is hence not spin. It is built by carefully assembling some right angled 120-cells along a pattern inspired by the minimum trisection of \mathbb{C}\mathbb{P}^2. The manifold M is also the first example of a compact orientable hyperbolic 4-manifold satisfying any of these conditions: 1) H_2(M,\mathbb{Z}) is not generated by geodesically immersed surfaces. 2) There is a covering \tilde{M} that is a non-trivial bundle over a compact surface.
