A fundamental result proved by Bourgain, Fremlin and Talagrand states that the space B_1(M) of Baire one functions over a Polish space M is an angelic space. Stegall extended this result by showing that the class B_1(M,E) of Baire one functions valued in a normed space E is angelic. These results motivate our study of various topological properties in the classes B_\alpha(X,G) of Baire-\alpha functions, where \alpha is a nonzero countable ordinal, G is a metrizable non-precompact abelian group and X is a G-Tychonoff first countable space. In particular, we show that (1) B_\alpha(X,G) is a \kappa-Fr\'{e}chet--Urysohn space and hence it is an Ascoli space, and (2) B_\alpha(X,G) is a k-space iff X is countable.
