The aim of this paper is to define and study \mathcal{B}-open sets and related properties. A \mathcal{B}-open set is, roughly speaking, a generalization of a b-open set, which is in turn a generalization of a pre-open set and a semi-open set. Using \mathcal{B}-open sets, we introduce a number of concepts such as \mathcal{B}-dense, \mathcal{B}-Frechet, contra-\mathcal{B}-closed graph and contra-\mathcal{B}-continuity. Also, we define a bi-operator topological space (X, \tau, T_1, T_2) which involves two operators T_1 and T_2, which are used to define \mathcal{B}-open sets.
