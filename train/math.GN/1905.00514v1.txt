Given an ideal \mathcal{I} on \omega and a sequence x in a topological vector space, we let the \mathcal{I}-core of x be the least closed convex set containing \{x_n: n \notin I\} for all I \in \mathcal{I}. We show two characterizations of the \mathcal{I}-core. This implies that the \mathcal{I}-core of a bounded sequence in \mathbf{R}^k is simply the convex hull of its \mathcal{I}-cluster points. As applications, we simplify and extend several results in the context of Pringsheim-convergence and e-convergence of double sequences.
