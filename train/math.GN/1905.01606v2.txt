In this article we introduce three maps, OLG, CLG and LG in LGT-space literature and show that these maps are extension of the continuous function in LGT-spaces and have the almost properties of the continuous functions. Also, it has been introduced and studied the natural notions, quotient, decomposition, weak LG-topology and isomorphism, related to the continuous function.
