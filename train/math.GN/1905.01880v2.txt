We consider all compatible topologies of an arbitrary finite-dimensional vector space over a non-trivial valuation field whose metric completion is a locally compact space. We construct the canonical lattice isomorphism between the lattice of all compatible topologies on the vector space and the lattice of all subspaces of the vector space whose coefficient field is extended to the complete valuation field. Moreover, in this situation, we use this isomorphism to characterize the continuity of linear maps between finite-dimensional vector spaces endowed with given compatible topologies, and also, we characterize all Hausdorff compatible topologies.
