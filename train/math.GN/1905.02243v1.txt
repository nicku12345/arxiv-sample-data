We prove that every usco multimap \Phi:X\to Y from a metrizable separable space X to a GO-space Y has an F_\sigma-measurable selection. On the other hand, for the split interval \ddot{\mathbb I} and the projection P:\ddot{\mathbb I}^2\to{\mathbb I}^2 of its square onto the unit square {\mathbb I}^2, the usco multimap P^{-1}:{\mathbb I}^2\multimap\ddot{\mathbb I}^2 has a Borel (F_\sigma-measurable) selection if and only if the Continuum Hypothesis holds. This CH-example shows that know results on Borel selections of usco maps into fragmentable compact spaces cannot be extended to a wider class of compact spaces.
