We study the algebraic entropy of continuous endomorphisms of compactly covered, locally compact, topologically quasihamiltonian groups. We provide a Limit-free formula which helps us to simplify the computations of this entropy. Moreover, several Addition Theorems are given. In particular, we prove that the Addition Theorem holds for endomorphisms of quasihamiltonian torsion FC-groups (e.g., Hamiltonian groups).
