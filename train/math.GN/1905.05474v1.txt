Coarse geometry is the study of large-scale properties of spaces. In this paper we study group coarse structures (i.e., coarse structures on groups that agree with the algebraic structures), by using group ideals. We introduce a large class of examples of group coarse structures induced by cardinal invariants. In order to enhance the categorical treatment of the subject, we use quasi-homomorphisms, as a large-scale counterpart of homomorphisms. In particular, the localisation of a category plays a fundamental role. We then define the notion of functorial coarse structures and we give various examples of those structures.
