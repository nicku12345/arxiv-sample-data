We modify our previous construction of link homology in order to include a natural duality functor \mathfrak{F}.   To a link L we associate a triply-graded module HXY(L) over the graded polynomial ring R(L)=\mathbb{C}[x_1,y_1,\dots,x_\ell,y_\ell]. The module has an involution \mathfrak{F} that intertwines the Fourier transform on R(L), \mathfrak{F}(x_i)=y_i, \mathfrak{F}(y_i)=x_i.   In the case when \ell=1 the module is free over R(L) and specialization to x=y=0 matches with the triply-graded knot homology previously constructed by the authors. Thus we show that the corresponding super-polynomial satisfies the categorical version of q\to 1/q symmetry.   We also construct an isotopy invariant of the closure of a dichromatic braid and relate this invariant to HXY(L).
