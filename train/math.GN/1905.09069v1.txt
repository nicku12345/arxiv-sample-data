Two-dimensional version of the classical Mycielski theorem says that for every comeager or conull set X\subseteq [0,1]^2 there exists a perfect set P\subseteq [0,1] such that P\times P\subseteq X\cup \Delta. We consider generalizations of this theorem by replacing a perfect square with a rectangle A\times B, where A and B are bodies of other types of trees with A\subseteq B. In particular, we show that for every comeager G_\delta set G\subseteq \omega^\omega\times \omega^\omega there exist a Miller tree M and a uniformly perfect tree P\subseteq M such that [P]\times [M]\subseteq G\cup\Delta and that P cannot be a Miller tree. In the case of measure we show that for every subset F of 2^{\omega}\times 2^\omega of full measure there exists a uniformly perfect tree P\subseteq 2^{<\omega} such that [P]\times[P]\subseteq F\cup\Delta and no side of such a rectangle can be a body of a Silver tree or a Miller tree. We also show some properties of forcing extensions of the real line from which we derive nonstandard proofs of Mycielski-like theorems via Shoenfield Absoluteness Theorem.
