By the additive property, we mean a condition under which L^p spaces over finitely additive measures are complete. Basile and Rao gives a necessary and sufficient condition that a finite sum of finitely additive measures has the additive property. We generalize this result to the case of a countable sum of finitely additive meaures. An application of this result to density measures are also presented.
