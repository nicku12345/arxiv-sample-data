In this paper, we prove that: (1) Let f:G\rightarrow H be a continuous d-open surjective homomorphism; if G is an \mathbb{R}-factorizabile paratopological group, then so is H. Peng and Zhang's result \cite[Theorem 1.7]{PZ} is improved. (2) Let G be a regular \mathbb{R}-factorizable paratopological group; then every subgroup H of G is \mathbb{R}-factorizable if and only if H is z-embedded in G. This result gives out a positive answer to an question of M.~Sanchis and M.~Tkachenko \cite[Problem 5.3]{ST}.
