The Hilbert-Smith conjecture states, for any connected topological manifold M, any locally compact subgroup of \mathrm{Homeo}(M) is a Lie group. We generalize basic results of Segal-Kosniowski-tomDieck (2.6), James-Segal (2.12), G Bredon (3.7), Jaworowski-Antonyan et al. (5.5), and E Elfving (7.3). The last is our main result: for any Lie group G, any Palais-proper topological G-manifold has the equivariant homotopy type of a countable proper G-CW complex. Along the way, we verify an n-classifying space for principal G-bundles (5.10) and that G has only countably many compact subgroups up to conjugacy (3.9).
