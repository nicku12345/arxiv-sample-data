Let USC^*_p(X) be the topological space of real upper semicontinuous bounded functions defined on X with the subspace topology of the product topology on {}^X\mathbb{R}. \tilde\Phi^{\uparrow},\tilde\Psi^{\uparrow} are the sets of all upper sequentially dense, upper dense or pointwise dense subsets of USC^*_p(X), respectively. We prove several equivalent assertions to the assertion USC^*_p(X) satisfies the selection principles S_1(\tilde\Phi^{\uparrow},\tilde\Psi^{\uparrow}), including a condition on the topological space X. We prove similar results for the topological space C^*_p(X) of continuous bounded functions. Similar results hold true for the selection principles S_{fin}(\tilde\Phi^{\uparrow},\tilde\Psi^{\uparrow}).
