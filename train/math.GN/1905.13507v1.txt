In 2013 Balka and M\'ath\'e showed that in uncountable polish spaces the typical compact set is not a fractal of any IFS. In 2008 Miculescu and Mihail introduced a concept of a generalized iterated function system (GIFS in short), a particular extension of classical IFS, in which they considered families of mappings defined on finite Cartesian product X^m with values in X. Recently, Secelean extended these considerations to mappings defined on the space \ell_\infty(X) of all bounded sequences of elements of X endowed with supremum metric. In the paper we show that in Euclidean spaces a typical compact set is an attractor in sense of Secelean and that in general in the polish spaces it can be perceived as selfsimilar in such sense.
