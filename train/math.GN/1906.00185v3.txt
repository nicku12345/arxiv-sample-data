Let \kappa be an infinite cardinal. A topological space X is \kappa-bounded if the closure of any subset of cardinality \le\kappa in X is compact. We discuss the problem of embeddability of topological spaces into Hausdorff (Urysohn, regular) \kappa-bounded spaces, and present a canonical construction of such an embedding. Also we construct a (consistent) example of a sequentially compact separable regular space that cannot be embedded into a Hausdorff \omega-bounded space.
