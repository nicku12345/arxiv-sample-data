In this paper, through the combination of Tietze extension theorem and Baer criteria, we build a new mathematical structure which is similar to a triangular pyramid, and then we prove that the topological space which we call it Tb appeared as a result of the combination and sat at the apex of the pyramid is a tychonof space. Finally, we obtain three new extension theorems
