We define the direct sum of a countable family of pointed metric spaces in a way resembling the direct sum of groups. Then we prove that if a family consists of 0-hyperbolic (in the sense of Gromov) and D-discrete spaces, then its direct sum has asymptotic property C. The main example is a countable direct sum of free groups of (possibly varying) finite rank. This is a generalization of T. Yamauchi's result concernig the countable direct sum of the integers.
