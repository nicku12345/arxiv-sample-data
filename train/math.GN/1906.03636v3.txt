For a frame L, let X_L be the Esakia space of L. We identify a special subset Y_L of X_L consisting of nuclear points of X_L, and prove the following results:   L is spatial iff Y_L is dense in X_L.   If L is spatial, then N(L) is spatial iff Y_L is weakly scattered.   If L is spatial, then N(L) is boolean iff Y_L is scattered.   As a consequence, we derive the well-known results of Beazer and Macnab [1979], Simmons [1980], Niefield and Rosenthal [1987], and Isbell [1972].
