In this paper we consider the problem of characterization of topological spaces that embed into countably compact Hausdorff spaces. We study the separation axioms of subspaces of countably compact Hausdorff spaces and construct an example of a regular separable scattered topological space which cannot be embedded into an Urysohn countably compact topological space but embeds into a Hausdorff countably compact space.
