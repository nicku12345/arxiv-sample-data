Propounding a general categorical framework for the extension of dualities, we present a new proof of the de Vries Duality Theorem for the category \bf KHaus of compact Hausdorff spaces and their continuous maps, as an extension of a restricted Stone duality. Then, applying a dualization of the categorical framework to the de Vries duality, we give an alternative proof of the extension of the de Vries duality to the category \bf Tych of Tychonoff spaces that was provided by Bezhanishvili, Morandi and Olberding. In the process of doing so, we obtain new duality theorems for both categories, \bf{KHaus} and \bf Tych.
