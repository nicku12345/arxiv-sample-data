We study the semigroup extension \mathscr{I}_\lambda^n(S) of a semigroup S by symmetric inverse semigroups of a bounded finite rank. We describe idempotents and regular elements of the semigroups \mathscr{I}_\lambda^n(S) and \overline{\mathscr{I}_\lambda^n}(S) show that the semigroup \mathscr{I}_\lambda^n(S) (\overline{\mathscr{I}_\lambda^n}(S)) is regular, orthodox, inverse or stable if and only if so is S. Green's relations are described on the semigroup \mathscr{I}_\lambda^n(S) for an arbitrary monoid S. We introduce the conception of a semigroup with strongly tight ideal series, and proved that for any infinite cardinal \lambda and any positive integer n the semigroup \mathscr{I}_\lambda^n(S) has a strongly tight ideal series provides so has S. At the finish we show that for every compact Hausdorff semitopological monoid (S,\tau_S) there exists a unique its compact topological extension \left(\mathscr{I}_\lambda^n(S),\tau_{\mathscr{I}}^\mathbf{c}\right) in the class of Haudorff semitopological semigroups.
