In this article, we continue our study of Baire one functions on a topological space X, denoted by B_1(X) and extend the well known M. H. Stones's theorem from C(X) to B_1(X). Introducing the structure space of B_1(X), it is observed that X may not be embedded inside this structure space. This observation inspired us to build a space \mathcal{M}(B_1(X))/\sim, from the structure space of B_1(X) and to show that X is densely embedded in \mathcal{M}(B_1(X))/\sim. It is further established that it is a T_0-compactification of X. Such compactification of X possesses the extension property for continuous functions, though it lacks Hausdorffness in general. Therefore, it is natural to search for condition(s) under which it becomes Hausdorff. In the last section, a set of necessary and sufficient conditions for such compactification to become a Stone-Ceck compatification, is finally arrived at.
