We show that, if H is a random subgroup of a finitely generated free group F_k, only inner automorphisms of F_k may leave H invariant. A similar result holds for random subgroups of toral relatively hyperbolic groups, more generally of groups which are hyperbolic relative to slender subgroups. These results follow from non-existence of splittings over slender groups which are relative to a random group element. Random subgroups are defined using random walks or balls in a Cayley tree of F_k.
