We study the Golomb spaces of Dedekind domains with torsion class group. In particular, we show that a homeomorphism between two such spaces sends prime ideals into prime ideals and preserves the P-adic topology on R\setminus P. Under certain hypothesis, we show that we can associate to a prime ideal P of R a partially ordered set, constructed from some subgroups of the group of units of R/P^n, which is invariant under homeomorphisms, and use this result to show that the unique self-homeomorphisms of the Golomb space of \mathbb{Z} are the identity and the multiplication by -1. We also show that the Golomb space of any Dedekind domain contained in the algebraic closure of \mathbb{Q} is not homeomorphic to the Golomb space of \mathbb{Z}.
