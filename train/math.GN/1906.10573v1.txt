In this article, we give a full description of a topological many-one degree structure of real-valued functions, recently introduced by Day-Downey-Westrick. We also point out that their characterization of the Bourgain rank of a Baire-one function of compact Polish domain can be extended to noncompact Polish domain. Finally, we clarify the relationship between the Martin conjecture and Day-Downey-Westrick's topological Turing-like reducibility, also known as parallelized continuous strong Weihrauch reducibility, for single-valued functions: Under the axiom of determinacy, we show that the continuous Weihrauch degrees of parallelizable single-valued functions are well-ordered; and moreover, if f is has continuous Weihrauch rank \alpha, then f' has continuous Weihrauch rank \alpha+1, where f'(x) is defined as the Turing jump of f(x).
