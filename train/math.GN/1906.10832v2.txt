We prove that for every T_0 space X, there is a well-filtered space W(X) and a continuous mapping \eta_X: X\lra W(X) such that for any well-filtered space Y and any continuous mapping f: X\lra Y there is a unique continuous mapping \hat{f}: W(X)\lra Y such that f=\hat{f}\circ \eta_X. Such a space W(X) will be called the well-filterification of X. This result gives a positive answer to one of the major open problems on well-filtered spaces. Another result on well-filtered spaces we will prove is that the product of two well-filtered spaces is well-filtered.
