Let Bo(T,\tau) be the Borel \sigma-algebra generated by the topology \tau on T. In this paper we show that if K is a Hausdorff compact space, then every subset of K is a Borel set if, and only if, Bo(C^*(K),w^*)=Bo(C^*(K),\|\cdot\|); where w^* denotes the weak-star topology and \|\cdot\| is the dual norm with respect to the sup-norm on the space of real-valued continuous functions C(K). Furthermore we study the topological properties of the Hausdorff compact spaces K such that every subset is a Borel set. In particular we show that, if the axiom of choice holds true, then K is scattered.
