We present a bound for the weak Lindel\"of number of the G_\delta-modification of a Hausdorff space which implies various known cardinal inequalities, including the following two fundamental results in the theory of cardinal invariants in topology: |X|\le 2^{L(X)\chi(X)} (Arhangel'skii) and |X|\le 2^{c(X)\chi (X)} (Hajnal-Juhasz). This solves a question that goes back to Bell, Ginsburg and Woods and is mentioned in Hodel's survey on Arhangel'skii's Theorem. In contrast to previous attempts we do not need any separation axiom beyond T_2.
