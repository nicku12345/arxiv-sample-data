Artin glueings provide a way to reconstruct a frame from a closed sublocale and its open complement. We show that Artin glueings can be described as the weakly Schreier split extensions in the category of frames with finite-meet preserving maps. These extensions correspond to meet-semilattice homomorphisms between frames, yielding an extension bifunctor. Finally, we discuss Baer sums, the induced order structure on extensions and the failure of the split short five lemma.
