A pair (\alpha, \beta) of simple closed geodesics on a closed and oriented hyperbolic surface M_g of genus g is called a filling pair if the complementary components of \alpha\cup\beta in M_g are simply connected. The length of a filling pair is defined to be the sum of their individual lengths. In \cite{Aou}, Aougab-Huang conjectured that the length of any filling pair on M is at least \frac{m_{g}}{2}, where m_{g} is the perimeter of the regular right-angled hyperbolic \left(8g-4\right)-gon.   In this paper, we prove a generalized isoperimetric inequality for disconnected regions and we prove the Aougab-Huang conjecture as a corollary.
