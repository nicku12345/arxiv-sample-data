Let X be a space equipped with n topologies \tau_1,...,\tau_n which are pairwise comparable and saturated, and for each 1\leq i\leq n let k_i and f_i be the associated topological closure and frontier operators, respectively. Inspired by the closure-complement theorem of Kuratowski, we prove that the monoid of set operators \mathcal{KF}_n generated by \{k_i,f_i:1\leq i\leq n\}\cup\{c\} (where c denotes the set complement operator) has cardinality no more than 2p(n) where p(n)=\frac{5}{24}n^4+\frac{37}{12}n^3+\frac{79}{24}n^2+\frac{101}{12}n+2. The bound is sharp in the following sense: for each n there exists a saturated polytopological space (X,\tau_1,...,\tau_n) and a subset A\subseteq X such that repeated application of the operators k_i, f_i, c to A will yield exactly 2p(n) distinct sets. In particular, following the tradition for Kuratowski-type problems, we exhibit an explicit initial set in \mathbb{R}, equipped with the usual and Sorgenfrey topologies, which yields 2p(2)=120 distinct sets under the action of the monoid \mathcal{KF}_2.
