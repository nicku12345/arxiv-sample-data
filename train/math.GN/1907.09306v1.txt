In this paper we shall consider a couple of properties of \sigma-ideals and study relations between them. Namely we will prove that \mathfrak{c}-cc \sigma-ideals are tall and that the Weaker Smital Property implies that every Borel \mathcal{I}-positive set contains a witness for non(\mathcal{I}) as well, as satisfying ccc and Fubini Property. We give also a characterization of nonmeasurability of \mathcal{I}-Luzin sets and prove that the ideal [\mathbb{R}]^{\leq\omega} does not posses the Fubini Property using some interesting lemma about perfect sets.
