In this paper, we define the asymptotic inductive dimension, asInd, of coarse proximity spaces. In the case of metric spaces equipped with their metric coarse proximity structure, this definition is equivalent to the definition of asInd given by Dranishnikov for proper metric spaces. We show that if the boundary of a coarse proximity space is completely traceable, then the asymptotic inductive dimension of the space is equal to the large inductive dimension of its boundary. We also provide conditions on the space under which the boundary is completely traceable. Finally, we use neighborhood filters to define an inductive dimension of coarse proximity spaces whose value agrees with the Brouwer dimension of the boundary.
