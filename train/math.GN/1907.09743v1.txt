We study splitting chains in \mathscr{P}(\omega), that is, families of subsets of \omega which are linearly ordered by \subseteq^* and which are splitting. We prove that their existence is independent of axioms of \mathsf{ZFC}. We show that they can be used to construct certain peculiar Banach spaces: twisted sums of C(\omega^*)=\ell_\infty/c_0 and c_0(\mathfrak c). Also, we consider splitting chains in a topological setting, where they give rise to the so called tunnels.
