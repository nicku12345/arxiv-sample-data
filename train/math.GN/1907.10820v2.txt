The automorphism group \Sigma of a compact topological projective plane with a 16-dimensional point space is a locally compact group. If the dimension of \Sigma is at least 29, then \Sigma is known to be a Lie group. For the connected component \Delta of \Sigma the condition \dim\Delta{\,\ge\,}27 suffices. Depending on the structure of \Delta and the configuration of the fixed elements of \Delta sharper bounds are obtained here. Example: If \Delta is semi-simple and fixes exactly one line and possibly several points on this line, then \Delta is a Lie group if \dim\Delta{\,\ge\,}11. Any semi-simple group \Delta which satisfies \dim\Delta{\,\ge\,}25 is a Lie group.
