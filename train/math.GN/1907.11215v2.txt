The note contains a few results related to separation axioms and automatic continuity of operations in compact-like semitopological groups. In particular, is presented a semiregular semitopological group G which is not T_3. We show that each weakly semiregular compact semitopological group is a topological group. On the other hand, constructed examples of quasiregular T_1 compact and T_2 sequentially compact quasitopological groups, which are not paratopological groups. Also we prove that a semitopological group (G,\tau) is a topological group provided there exists a Hausdorff topology \sigma\supset\tau on G such that (G,\sigma) is a precompact topological group and (G,\tau) is weakly semiregular or (G,\sigma) is a feebly compact paratopological group and (G,\tau) is T_3.
