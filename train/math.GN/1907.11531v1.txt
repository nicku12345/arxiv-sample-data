For a topologically complete space X and a family of closed covers \mathcal A of X satisfying a "local refinement condition" and a "completeness condition," we give a construction of an inverse system \mathbf{ N}_{\mathcal A} of simplicial complexes and simplicial bonding maps such that the limit space N_{\infty} = \varprojlim \mathbf{N}_{\mathcal A} is homotopy equivalent to X. A connection with cell structures [2],[3] is discussed
