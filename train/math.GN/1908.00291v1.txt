We examine the chaotic behavior of certain continuous linear operators on infinite-dimensional Banach spaces, and provide several equivalent characterizations of when these operators have infinite topological entropy.   For example, it is shown that infinite topological entropy is equivalent to non-zero topological entropy for translation operators on weighted Lebesgue function spaces. In particular, finite non-zero entropy is impossible for this class of operators, which answers a question raised by Yin and Wei.
