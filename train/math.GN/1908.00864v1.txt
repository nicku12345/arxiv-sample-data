Let \mathcal{A} be a field of subsets of a set X and \EuScript{M}(X,\mathcal{A}) be the ring of all real valued \mathcal{A}-measurable functions on X. It is shown that \EuScript{M}(X,\mathcal{A}) is self-injective if and only if \mathcal{A} is a complete and \mathfrak{c}^+- additive field of sets. This answers a question raised in [H. Azadi, M. Henriksen and E. Momtahan, \textit{Some properties of algebras of real valued measurable functions}, Acta Math. Hungar, 124, (2009), 15--23]. Also, it is observed that if \mathcal{A} is a \sigma-field, \EuScript{M}(X,\mathcal{A}) modulo its socle is self-injective if and only if \mathcal{A} is a complete and \mathfrak{c}^+- additive field of sets with a finite number of atoms.
