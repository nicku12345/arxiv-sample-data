We recall a variation of a construction due to Laakso \cite{LA}, also used by Lang and Plaut \cite{LA} of a doubling metric space X that cannot be embedded into any Hilbert space. We give a more concrete version of this construction and motivated by the results of Olson \& Robinson \cite{OR}, we consider the Kuratowski embedding \Phi(X) of X into L^{\infty}(X) and prove that \Phi(X)-\Phi(X) is not doubling.
