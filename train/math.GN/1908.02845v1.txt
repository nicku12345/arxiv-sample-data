Vietoris hyperspaces \mathcal A_n(X) (\mathcal A_\omega(X)) of infinite compact subsets of a metric space X which have at most n (finitely many, resp.) accumulation points are studied.   If X is a dense-in-itself, 0-dimensional Polish space, then \mathcal A_n(X) is homeomorphic to the product \mathbb Q^{\mathbb N}. The hyperspaces \mathcal A_1(\mathbb Q,\{q\}) and \mathcal A_1(\mathbb R\setminus\mathbb Q,\{p\}) of all A\in \mathcal A_1(\mathbb Q) (resp. A\in \mathcal A_1(\mathbb R\setminus\mathbb Q)) which accumulate at q\in\mathbb Q (resp. p\in \mathbb R\setminus\mathbb Q) are also homeomorphic to \mathbb Q^{\mathbb N}.   If X is a nondegenerate locally connected metric continuum then hyperspaces \mathcal A_n(X) are absolute retracts for all n\in\mathbb N\cup\{\omega\}. If X=J=[-1,1] or X=S^1, the hyperspaces \mathcal A_n(X) are characterized as F_{\sigma\delta}-absorbers in hyperspaces \mathcal K(J) and \mathcal K(S^1) of all compacta in J and S^1, respectively. Consequently, they are homeomorphic to the linear space \{(x_k) \in\mathbb R^{\mathbb N}: \lim x_k=0\} with the product topology. The hyperspaces \mathcal A_\omega(X) for X being a Euclidean cube, the Hilbert cube, the m-dimensional unit sphere S^m, m\ge 1, or a compact m-manifold with boundary in S^m, m\ge 3, are true F_{\sigma\delta\sigma}-sets which are strongly F_{\sigma\delta}-universal in the respective hyperspaces of all compacta.
