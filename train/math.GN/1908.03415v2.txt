We provide some characterizations of precompact abelian groups G whose dual group G_p^\wedge endowed with the pointwise convergence topology on elements of G contains a nontrivial convergent sequence. In the special case of precompact abelian \emph{torsion} groups G, we characterize the existence of a nontrivial convergent sequence in G_p^\wedge by the following property of G: \emph{No infinite quotient group of G is countable.} Finally, we present an example of a dense subgroup G of the compact metrizable group \mathbb{Z}(2)^\omega such that G is of the first category in itself, has measure zero, but the dual group G_p^\wedge does not contain infinite compact subsets. This complements Theorem 1.6 in [J.E.~Hart and K.~Kunen, Limits in function spaces and compact groups, \textit{Topol. Appl.} \textbf{151} (2005), 157--168]. As a consequence, we obtain an example of a precompact reflexive abelian group which is of the first Baire category.
