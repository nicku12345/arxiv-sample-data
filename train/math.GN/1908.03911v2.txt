Let X be a set, B_{X} denotes the family of all subsets of X and F: X \longrightarrow B_{X} be a set-valued mapping such that x \in F(x), sup_{x\in X} | F(x)|< \kappa, sup_{x\in X} | F^{-1}(x)|< \kappa for all x\in X and some infinite cardinal \kappa. Then there exists a family \mathcal{F} of bijective selectors of F such that |\mathcal{F}|<\kappa and F(x) = \{ f(x): f\in\mathcal{F}\} for each x\in X. We apply this result to G-space representations of balleans.
