The notions of compactness and Hausdorff separation for generalized enriched categories allow us, as classically done for the category \mathsf{Top} of topological spaces and continuous functions, to study \textit{compactly generated spaces} and \textit{quasi-spaces} in this setting. Moreover, for a class \mathcal{C} of objects we generalize the notion of \textit{\mathcal{C}-generated spaces}, from which we derive, for instance, a general concept of \textit{Alexandroff spaces}. Furthermore, as done for \mathsf{Top}, we also study, in our level of generality, the relationship between compactly generated spaces and quasi-spaces.
