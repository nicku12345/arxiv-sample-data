A Hausdorff topology \tau on the bicyclic monoid with adjoined zero \mathcal{C}^0 is called {\em weak} if it is contained in the coarsest inverse semigroup topology on \mathcal{C}^0. We show that the lattice \mathcal{W} of all weak shift-continuous topologies on \mathcal{C}^0 is isomorphic to the lattice of all shift-invariant filters on \omega with an attached element 1 endowed with the following partial order: \mathcal{F}\leq \mathcal{G} iff \mathcal{G}=1 or \mathcal{F}\subset \mathcal{G}. Also, we investigate cardinal characteristics of the lattice \mathcal{W}. In particular, we proved that \mathcal{W} contains an antichain of cardinality 2^{\mathfrak{c}} and a well-ordered chain of cardinality \mathfrak{c}. Moreover, there exists a well-ordered chain of first-countable weak topologies of order type \mathfrak{t}.
