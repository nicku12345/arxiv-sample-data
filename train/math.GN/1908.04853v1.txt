Given an ideal \mathcal{I} on the positive integers, a real sequence (x_n) is said to be \mathcal{I}-statistically convergent to \ell provided that  \textstyle \left\{n \in \mathbf{N}: \frac{1}{n}|\{k \le n: x_k \notin U\}| \ge \varepsilon\right\} \in \mathcal{I}  for all neighborhoods U of \ell and all \varepsilon>0. First, we show that \mathcal{I}-statistical convergence coincides with \mathcal{J}-convergence, for some unique ideal \mathcal{J}=\mathcal{J}(\mathcal{I}). In addition, \mathcal{J} is Borel [analytic, coanalytic, respectively] whenever \mathcal{I} is Borel [analytic, coanalytic, resp.].   Then we prove, among others, that if \mathcal{I} is the summable ideal \{A\subseteq \mathbf{N}: \sum_{a \in A}1/a<\infty\} or the density zero ideal \{A\subseteq \mathbf{N}: \lim_{n\to \infty} \frac{1}{n}|A\cap [1,n]|=0\} then \mathcal{I}-statistical convergence coincides with statistical convergence. This can be seen as a Tauberian theorem which extends a classical theorem of Fridy. Lastly, we show that this is never the case if \mathcal{I} is maximal.
