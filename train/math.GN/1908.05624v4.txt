Let X and Y be topological spaces. Let C be a path-connected closed set of X\times Y. Suppose that C is locally direct product, that is, for any (a,b)\in X\times Y, there exist an open set U of X, an open set V of Y, a subset I of U and a subset J of V such that (a,b) \in U\times V and C\cap (U\times V)=I\times J hold. Then, in this memo, we show that C is globally so, that is, there exist a subset A of X and a subset B of Y such that C=A\times B holds. The proof is elementary. Here, we note that one might be able to think of a (perhaps, open) similar problem for a fiber product of locally trivial fiber spaces, not just for a direct product of topological spaces.   In Appendix, we mentioned a simple example of a C([0,1];\mathbb R)-manifold that cannot be embedded in the direct product (C([0,1];\mathbb R))^n as a C([0,1];\mathbb R)-submanifold. In addition, we introduce the concept of topological 2-space, which is locally the direct product of topological spaces and an analog of homotopy category for topological 2-space. Finally, we raise a question on the existence of an \mathbb R^n-Morse function and the existence of an \mathbb R^n-immersion in a finite-dimensional \mathbb R^n-Euclidean space. Here, we note that the problem of defining the concept of an \mathbb R^n-handle body may also be considered.
