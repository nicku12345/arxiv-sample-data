A subset X of a Polish group G is \emph{Haar null} if there exists a Borel probability measure \mu and a Borel set B containing X such that \mu(gBh)=0 for every g,h \in G. A set X is \emph{Haar meager} if there exists a compact metric space K, a continuous function f : K \to G and a Borel set B containing X such that f^{-1}(gBh) is meager in K for every g,h \in G. We calculate (in ZFC) the four cardinal invariants (\rm add, \rm cov, \rm non, \rm cof) of these two \sigma-ideals for the simplest non-locally compact Polish group, namely in the case G = \mathbb{Z}^\omega. In fact, most results work for separable Banach spaces as well, and many results work for Polish groups admitting a two-sided invariant metric. This answers a question of the first named author and Z. Vidny\'anszky.
