Let X be a continuum and let C(X) denote the hyperspace of subcontinua of X, endowed with the Hausdorff metric. For p\in X, define the hyperspace C(p,X)=\{A\in C(X):p\in A\} as a subspace of C(X). In this paper we introduced the quotient space HS(p,X)=C(X)/C(p,X). We present some general properties of HS(p,X) and we study the relationship between the continuum X and the hyperspaces C(X) and HS(p,X).
