Given a continuum X and p\in X, we will consider the hyperspace C(p,X) of all subcontinua of X containing p. Given a family of continua \mathcal{C}, a continuum X\in\mathcal{C} and p\in X, we say that (X,p) has unique hyperspace C(p,X) relative to \mathcal{C} if for each Y\in\mathcal{C} and q\in Y such that C(p,X) and C(q,Y) are homeomorphic, then there is an homeomorphism between X and Y sending p to q. In this paper we study some topological and geometric properties about the structure of C(p,X) when X is a tree, being the main result that (X,p) has unique hyperspace C(p,X) relative to the class of trees.
