We introduce the so--called doubling metric on the collection of non--empty bounded open subsets of a metric space. Given a subset U of a metric space X, the predecessor U_{*} of U is defined by doubling the radii of all open balls contained inside U, and taking their union. If U is open, the predecessor of U is an open set containing U. The directed doubling distance between U and another subset V is the number of times that the predecessor operation needs to be applied to U to obtain a set that contains V. Finally, the doubling distance between U and V is the maximum of the directed distance between U and V and the directed distance between V and U.
