Let us call a (para)topological group \emph{strongly submetrizable} if it admits a coarser separable metrizable (para)topological group topology. We present a characterization of simply sm-factorizable (para)topo\-logical groups by means of continuous real-valued functions. We show that a (para)topo\-logical group G is a simply sm-factorizable if and only if for each continuous function f\colon G\to \mathbb{R}, one can find a continuous homomorphism \varphi of G onto a strongly submetrizable (para)topological group H and a continuous function g\colon H\to \mathbb{R} such that f=g\circ\varphi. This characterization is applied for the study of completions of simply sm-factorizable topological groups. We prove that the equalities \mu{G}=\varrho_\omega{G}=\upsilon{G} hold for each Hausdorff simply sm-factorizable topological group G. This result gives a positive answer to a question posed by Arhangel'skii and Tkachenko in 2018. Also, we consider realcompactifications of simply sm-factorizable paratopological groups. It is proved, among other results, that the realcompactification, \upsilon{G}, and the Dieudonn\'e completion, \mu{G}, of a regular simply sm-factorizable paratopological group G coincide and that \upsilon{G} admits the natural structure of paratopological group containing G as a dense subgroup and, furthermore, \upsilon{G} is also simply sm-factorizable. Some results in [\emph{Completions of paratopological groups, Monatsh. Math. \textbf{183} (2017), 699--721}] are improved or generalized.
