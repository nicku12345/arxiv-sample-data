In this paper, we have established boundaries of cardinal numbers of nonempty sets in finite non-T_1 topological spaces using interval analysis. For a finite set with known cardinality, we give interval estimations based on the closure and interior of the set. In this paper, we give new results for the cardinalities of non-empty semi-open sets in non-T_1 topological spaces as well as in extremely disconnected and hyperconnected topological spaces.
