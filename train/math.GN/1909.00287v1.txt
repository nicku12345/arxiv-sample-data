Given an autohomeomorphism on an ordered topological space or its subspace, we show that it is sometimes possible to introduce a new topology-compatible order on that space so that the same map is monotonic with respect to the new ordering. We note that the existence of such a re-ordering for a given map is equivalent to the map being conjugate (topologically equivalent) to a monotonic map on some homeomorphic ordered space. We observe that the latter cannot always be chosen to be order-isomorphic to the original space. Also, we identify other routes that may lead to similar affirmative statements for other classes of spaces and maps.
