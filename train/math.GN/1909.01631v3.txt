We provide a direct and elementary proof of the fact that the category of Nachbin's compact ordered spaces is dually equivalent to an Aleph_1-ary variety of algebras. Further, we show that Aleph_1 is a sharp bound: compact ordered spaces are not dually equivalent to any SP-class of finitary algebras.
