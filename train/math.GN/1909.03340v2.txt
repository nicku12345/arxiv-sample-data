Assuming the existence of \mathfrak c incomparable selective ultrafilters, we classify the non-torsion Abelian groups of cardinality \mathfrak c that admit a countably compact group topology. We show that for each \kappa \in [\mathfrak c, 2^\mathfrak c] each of these groups has a countably compact group topology of weight \kappa without non-trivial convergent sequences and another that has convergent sequences.   Assuming the existence of 2^\mathfrak c selective ultrafilters, there are at least 2^\mathfrak c non homeomorphic such topologies in each case and we also show that every Abelian group of cardinality at most 2^\mathfrak c is algebraically countably compact. We also show that it is consistent that every Abelian group of cardinality \mathfrak c that admits a countably compact group topology admits a countably compact group topology without non-trivial convergent sequences whose weight has countable cofinality.
