We show that if \kappa \leq \omega and there exists a group topology without non-trivial convergent sequences on an Abelian group H such that H^n is countably compact for each n<\kappa then there exists a topological group G such that G^n is countably compact for each n <\kappa and G^{\kappa} is not countably compact. If in addition H is torsion, then the result above holds for \kappa=\omega_1. Combining with other results in the literature, we show that:   a) Assuming {\mathfrak c} incomparable selective ultrafilters, for each n \in \omega, there exists a group topology on the free Abelian group G such that G^n is countably compact and G^{n+1} is not countably compact. (It was already know for \omega).   b) If \kappa \in \omega \cup \{\omega\} \cup \{\omega_1\}, there exists in ZFC a topological group G such that G^\gamma is countably compact for each cardinal \gamma <\kappa and G^\kappa is not countably compact.
