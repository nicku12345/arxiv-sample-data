We prove that the existence of a selective ultrafilter implies the existence of a countably compact Hausdorff group topology on the free Abelian group of size continuum. As a consequence, we show that the existence of a selective ultrafilter implies the existence of a Wallace semigroup (i.e., a countably compact both-sided cancellative topological semigroup which is not a topological group).
