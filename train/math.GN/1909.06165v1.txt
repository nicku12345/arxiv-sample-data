A subset E of a metric space X is said to be starlike-equivalent if it has a neighbourhood which is mapped homeomorphically into \mathbb{R}^n for some n, sending E to a starlike set. A subset E\subset X is said to be recursively starlike-equivalent if it can be expressed as a finite nested union of closed subsets \{E_i\}_{i=0}^{N+1} such that E_{i}/E_{i+1}\subset X/E_{i+1} is starlike-equivalent for each i and E_{N+1} is a point. A decomposition \mathcal{D} of a metric space X is said to be recursively starlike-equivalent, if there exists N\geq 0 such that each element of \mathcal{D} is recursively starlike-equivalent of filtration length N.   We prove that any null, recursively starlike-equivalent decomposition \mathcal{D} of a compact metric space X shrinks, that is, the quotient map X\to X/\mathcal{D} is the limit of a sequence of homeomorphisms. This is a strong generalisation of results of Denman-Starbird and Freedman and is applicable to the proof of Freedman's celebrated disc embedding theorem. The latter leads to a multitude of foundational results for topological 4-manifolds, including the 4-dimensional Poincar\'{e} conjecture.
