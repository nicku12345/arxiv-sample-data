The Reeb space of a function or a map on a manifold is defined as the space of all connected components of preimages and represents the manifold compactly. In fact, Reeb spaces are fundamental and useful tools in geometric theory of Morse functions and more general maps being not so wild.   Can we construct an explicit good function inducing a given graph as the Reeb space (Reeb graph)? These problems were launched by Sharko in 2000s and have been explicitly solved by several researchers and motivated by this, the author also set and solved problems of new types.   A pseudo quotient map on a differentiable manifold is a surjective continuous map onto a lower dimensional polyhedron and defined as a map locally regarded as the natural quotient map onto the Reeb space induced from a differentiable map of a given class. A pseudo quotient map is first defined by Kobayashi and Saeki in 1996 as useful objects in investigating manifolds whose dimensions are larger than 2 via generic smooth maps into the plane and later the author used these objects in new explicit situations starting from redefining them. In this paper, we consider classes of continuous or differentiable maps on manifolds, introduce the Reeb graphs of the maps and redefine pseudo quotient maps onto graphs in a bit different way. Last, we set and solve a new problem on construction before.
