We show that if X is a separable locally compact Hausdorff connected space with fewer than \mathfrak c non-cut points, then X embeds into a dendrite D\subseteq \mathbb R ^2, and the set of non-cut points of X is a nowhere dense G_\delta-set. We then prove a Tychonoff cut-point space X is weakly orderable if and only if \beta X is an irreducible continuum. Finally, we show every separable metrizable cut-point space densely embeds into a reducible continuum with no cut points. By contrast, there is a Tychonoff cut-point space each of whose compactifications has the same cut point. The example raises some questions about persistent cut points in Tychonoff spaces.
