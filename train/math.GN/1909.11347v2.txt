We show that a surjective map between compact ANR's (absolute neighborhood retracts) is a homotopy equivalence if the fibers are contractible and either the domain is simply connected or the fibers are also ANR's. This is a geometric analogue of the Vietoris-Begle theorem. We use it to show that if L is a locally convex Riesz space, C \subset L is compact, convex, and metrizable, x \in L, and the function y \mapsto x \vee y (y \mapsto x \wedge y) is continuous, then the \{ x \vee y : y \in C \} is a compact contractible ANR.
