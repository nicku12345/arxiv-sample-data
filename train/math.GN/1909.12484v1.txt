Takahashi et al have shown that every decreasing sequence of nonempty, bounded, closed, convex subsets of a complete, uniformly (Takahashi's) W- convex metric space has nonempty intersection. This article presents an extension of this nonempty intersection property of W- convex metric space to a Menger convex metric space. We study some characteristics of the Menger convex metric spaces. Using these results, fixed point results for (\alpha, \beta)- generalized hybrid mapping on Menger convex metric space are discussed. As an application, it is discussed how these results are applicable to a metrizable topological real vector space with some specific Takahashi's W- convex structure on it.
