A bornology \mathcal{B} on a set X is called minmax if the smallest and the largest coarse structures on X compatible with \mathcal{B} coincide.   We prove that \mathcal{B} is minmax if and only if the family \mathcal B^\sharp=\{p\in\beta X:\{X\setminus B:B\in\mathcal B\}\subset p\} consists of ultrafilters which are pairwise non-isomorphic via \mathcal B-preserving bijections of X. Also we construct a minmax bornology \mathcal B on \omega such that the set \mathcal B^\sharp is infinite. We deduce this result from the existence of a closed infinite subset in \beta\omega that consists of pairwise non-isomorphic ultrafilters.
