For a\in [0,+\infty), the function space E_{\geq a} (E_{>a}; E_{\leq a}; E_{<a}) of all continuous maps from [0,1] to itself whose topological entropies are larger than or equal to a (larger than a; smaller than or equal to a; smaller than a) with the supremum metric is investigated. It is shown that the spaces E_{\geq a} and E_{>a} are homeomorphic to the Hilbert space l_2 and the spaces E_{\leq a} and E_{<a} are contractible. Moreover, the subspaces of E_{\leq a} and E_{<a} consisting of all piecewise monotone maps are homotopy dense in them, respectively.
