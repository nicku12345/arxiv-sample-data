The proofs of A. Villani on inclusion relations among classical Lebesgue spaces are dicussed. The techinque of using closed graph theorem, due to Villani, is applied to derive results on inclusion relations among some more additional spaces. An application of automatic continuity of multiplicative linear functionals on Banach algebras is found.
