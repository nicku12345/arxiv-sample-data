E.D. Tymchatyn constructed a hereditarily locally connected continuum which can be approximated by a sequence of mutually disjoint arcs. We show the example re-opens a conjecture of G.T. Seidler and H. Kato about continua which admit positive entropy homeomorphisms. We prove that every indecomposable semicontinuum can be approximated by a sequence of disjoint subcontinua, and no composant of an indecomposable continuum can be embedded into a Suslinian continuum. We also prove that if Y is a hereditarily unicoherent Suslinian continuum, then there exists \varepsilon>0 such that every two \varepsilon-dense subcontinua of Y intersect.
