In this paper we study the selection principle of closed discrete selection, first researched by Tkachuk in [13] and strengthened by Clontz, Holshouser in [3], in set-open topologies on the space of continuous real-valued functions.   Adapting the techniques involving point-picking games on \(X\) and \(C_p(X)\), the current authors showed similar equivalences in [1] involving the compact subsets of \(X\) and \(C_k(X)\).   By pursuing a bitopological setting, we have touched upon a unifying framework which involves three basic techniques: general game duality via reflections (Clontz), general game equivalence via topological connections, and strengthening of strategies (Pawlikowski and Tkachuk).   Moreover, we develop a framework which identifies topological notions to match with generalized versions of the point-open game.
