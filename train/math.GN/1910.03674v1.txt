Profinite algebras have been extensively considered in the literature. They are the residually finite Stone topological algebras. We introduce Stone pseudovarieties, that is, classes of Stone topological algebras of a fixed signature that are closed under taking Stone quotients, closed subalgebras and finite direct products. In particular, we are interested in free structures relative to Stone pseudovarieties. In the unary case, the \v{C}ech-Stone compactification of the term algebra provides a construction of the absolutely free Stone topological algebra. A natural representation in a free profinite monoid using the Polish notation turns out also to be faithful for free profinite unary algebras. Looking at Stone spaces as the dual spaces of Boolean algebras, which may be taken as subalgebras of the Boolean algebra of subsets of the algebra of terms, we find a simple characterization of when the dual space admits a natural structure of topological algebra. This provides a new approach to duality theory which, in the case of a Stone signature, culminates in the proof that a Stone quotient of a Stone topological algebra that is residually in a given Stone pseudovariety is also residually in it, thereby extending the corresponding result of Gehrke for the Stone pseudovariety of all finite algebras over discrete signatures. The residual closure of a Stone pseudovariety is thus a Stone pseudovariety. A Birkhoff type theorem for residually closed Stone pseudovarieties is also established.
