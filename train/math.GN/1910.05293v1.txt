A topological space is Suslin (Lusin) if it is a continuous (and bijective) image of a Polish space. For a Tychonoff space X let C_p(X), C_k(X) and C_{{\downarrow}F}(X) be the space of continuous real-valued functions on X, endowed with the topology of pointwise convergence, the compact-open topology, and the Fell hypograph topology, respectively. For a metrizable space X we prove the equivalence of the following statements: (1) X is \sigma-compact, (2) C_p(X) is Suslin, (3) C_k(X) is Suslin, (4) C_{{\downarrow}F}(X) is Suslin, (5) C_p(X) is Lusin, (6) C_k(X) is Lusin, (7) C_{{\downarrow}F}(X) is Lusin, (8) C_p(X) is F_\sigma-Lusin, (9) C_k(X) is F_\sigma-Lusin, (10) C_{{\downarrow}F}(X) is C_{\delta\sigma}-Lusin. Also we construct an example of a sequential \aleph_0-space X with a unique non-isolated point such that the function spaces C_p(X), C_k(X) and C_{{\downarrow}F}(X) are not Suslin.
