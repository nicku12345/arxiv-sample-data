In this article we discuss a connection between two famous constructions in mathematics: a Cayley graph of a group and a (rational) billiard surface. For each rational billiard surface, there is a natural way to draw a Cayley graph of a dihedral group on that surface. Both of these objects have the concept of "genus" attached to them. For the Cayley graph, the genus is defined to be the lowest genus amongst all surfaces that the graph can be drawn on without edge crossings. We prove that the genus of the Cayley graph associated to a billiard surface arising from a triangular billiard table is always zero or one. One reason this is interesting is that there exist triangular billiard surfaces of arbitrarily high genus , so the genus of the associated graph is usually much lower than the genus of the billiard surface.
