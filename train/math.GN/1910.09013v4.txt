Ge and Lin (2015) proved the existence and the uniqueness of p-Cauchy completions of partial metric spaces under symmetric denseness. They asked if every (non-empty) partial metric space X has a p-Cauchy completion \bar{X} such that X is dense but not symmetrically dense in \bar{X}. We construct asymmetric p-Cauchy completions for all non-empty partial metric spaces. This gives a positive answer to the question. We also provide a nonstandard construction of partial metric completions.
