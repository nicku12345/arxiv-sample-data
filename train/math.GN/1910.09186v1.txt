For a topological space X its reflection in a class \mathsf T of topological spaces is a pair (\mathsf T X,i_X) consisting of a space \mathsf T X\in\mathsf T and continuous map i_X:X\to \mathsf T X such that for any continuous map f:X\to Y to a space Y\in\mathsf T there exists a unique continuous map \bar f:\mathsf T X\to Y such that f=\bar f\circ i_X. In this paper for an infinite cardinal \kappa and a nonempty set M of ultrafilters on \kappa, we study the reflections of topological spaces in the classes \mathsf H_\kappa of \kappa-bounded Hausdorff spaces and \mathsf H_M of M-compact Hausdorff spaces (a topological space X is \kappa-bounded if the closures of subsets of cardinality \le\kappa in X are compact; X is M-compact if any function x:\kappa\to X has a p-limit in M for every ultrafilter p\in M).
