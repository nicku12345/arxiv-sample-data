In this paper, using commutative algebra, then new and significant advances on the compactifications of topological spaces, especially on the Stone-\v{C}ech and Alexandroff compactifications have been made. Especially among them, it is proved that the minimal spectrum of the direct product of a family of integral domains and also the maximal spectrum of the direct product of a family of local rings both indexed by a set X are the Stone-\v{C}ech compactifications of the discrete space X. Some applications of this study are given. Especially, it is shown that the Stone-\v{C}ech compactification of an arbitrary topological space X is obtained from the Stone-\v{C}ech compactification of the discrete space X by passing to a its certain quotient. A natural and simple way to construct ultra-rings is introduced, then this new approach is used to obtain nontrivial results on the Stone-\v{C}ech compactification.
