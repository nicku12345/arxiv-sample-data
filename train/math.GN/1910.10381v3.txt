Urysohn's Lemma is a crucial property of normal spaces that deals with separation of closed sets by continuous functions. It is also a fundamental ingredient in proving the Tietze Extension Theorem, another property of normal spaces that deals with the existence of extensions of continuous functions. Using the Cantor function, we give alternative proofs for Urysohn's Lemma and the Tietze Extension Theorem.
