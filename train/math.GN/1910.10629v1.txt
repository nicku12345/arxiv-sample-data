We show that \mathsf{PFA} implies that the tightness t(X_\delta) of the G_\delta-modification of a Fr\'echet \alpha_1-space X is at most \omega_1, while \Box(\kappa) implies that there is a Fr\'echet \alpha_1-space with G_\delta-tightness equal to \kappa. We use the example constructed from \Box(\kappa) to show that a local version of the bound t(X_\delta)\le 2^{t(X)L(X)} does not hold. We also construct, assuming \mathsf{MA}, an example of a Fr\'echet space whose G_\delta-tightness is larger than \omega_1.
