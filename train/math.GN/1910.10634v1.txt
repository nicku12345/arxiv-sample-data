This paper addresses several questions of Feng, Gruenhage, and Shen which arose from Michael's theory of continuous selections from countable spaces. We construct an example of a space which is L-selective but not \mathbb{Q}-selective from \mathfrak{d}=\omega_1, and an L-selective space which is not selective for a P-point ultrafilter from the assumption of \mathsf{CH}. We also produce \mathsf{ZFC} examples of Fr\'echet spaces where countable subsets are first countable which are not L-selective.
