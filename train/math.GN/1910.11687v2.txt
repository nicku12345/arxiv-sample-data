Following a recent idea by Ball, we introduce the notion of strongly truncated Riesz space with a suitable spectrum. We prove that, under an extra Archimedean type condition, any strongly truncated Riesz space is isomorphic to a uniformly dense Riesz subspace of a C_{0}\left( X\right) -space. This turns out to be a direct generalization of the classical Kakutani Representation Theorem on Archimedean Riesz spaces with strong unit. Another representation theorem on normed Riesz spaces, due to Fremlin, will be obtained as a consequence of our main result.
