Let f\colon\mathbb{R}^2\to\mathbb{R}. The notions of feebly continuity and very feebly continuity of f at a point \langle x,y\rangle\in\mathbb{R}^2 were considered by I. Leader in 2009. We study properties of the sets FC(f) (respectively, VFC(f)\supset FC(f)) of points at which f is feebly continuous (very feebly continuous). We prove that VFC(f) is densely nonmeager, and, if f has the Baire property (is measurable), then FC(f) is residual (has full outer Lebesgue measure). We describe several examples of functions f for which FC(f)\neq VFC(f). Then we consider the notion of two-feebly continuity which is strictly weaker than very feebly continuity. We prove that the set of points where (an arbitrary) f is two-feebly continuous forms a residual set of full outer measure. Finally, we study the existence of large algebraic structures inside or outside various sets of feebly continuous functions.
