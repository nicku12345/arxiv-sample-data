Let \mathcal{C}(G) denote the Chabauty space of closed subgroups of the locally compact group G. In this paper, we first prove that \mathcal{C} (\mathbb{Q}_p^\times) is a proper compactification of \mathbb{N}, identified with the set N of open subgroups with finite index. Then we identify the space \mathcal{C}(\mathbb{Q}_p^\times) \smallsetminus N up to homeomorphism: e.g. for p=2, it is the Cantor space on which 2 copies of \overline{\mathbb{N}} (the 1-point compactification of \mathbb{N}) are glued.
