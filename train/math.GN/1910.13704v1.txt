In this paper, we introduce a generalization of rectangular b-metric spaces, by changing the rectangular inequality as follows \begin{equation*} \rho(x,y)\le \theta(x,y,u,v)[\rho(x,u)+\rho(u,v)+\rho(v,y)], \end{equation*}% for all distinct\ x,y,u,v\in X. We prove some fixed-point theorems and we use our results to present a nice application in last section of this paper. Moreover, in the conclusion we present some new open questions.
