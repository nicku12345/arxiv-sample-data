In this paper, we continue to investigate topological properties of \mathcal{I}H and its two star versions namely SS \mathcal{I} H and S \mathcal{I} H. We characterized \mathcal{I}-Hurewicz property by \mathcal{I}-Hurewicz Basis property and \mathcal{I}-Hurewicz measure zero property for metrizable spaces. We also characterized \mathcal{I}-Hurewicz property, star-\mathcal{I}-Hurewicz property and strongly star-\mathcal{I}-Hurewicz property using selection principles.
