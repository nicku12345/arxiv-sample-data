As it was introduced by Tkachuk and Wilson, a topological space X is cellular-compact if given any cellular, i.e. disjoint, family \mathcal U of non-empty open subsets of X there is a compact subspace K\subset X such that K\cap U\ne \emptyset for each U\in \mathcal U.   Answering several questions raised by Tkachuk and Wilson we show that   (1) any first countable cellular-compact T_2 space is T_3, and so its cardinality is at most \mathfrak{c} = 2^{\omega};   (2) cov(\mathcal M)>{\omega}_1 implies that every first countable and separable cellular-compact T_2 space is compact;   (3 if there is no S-space then any cellular-compact T_3 space of countable spread is compact;   (4) MA_{{\omega}_1} implies that every point of a compact T_2 space of countable spread has a disjoint local \pi-base.
