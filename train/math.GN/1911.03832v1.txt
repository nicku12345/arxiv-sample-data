The notion of strong measure zero is studied in the context of Polish groups. In particular, the extent to which the theorem of Galvin, Mycielski and Solovay holds in the context of an arbitrary Polish group is studied. Hausdorff measure and dimension is used to characterize strong measure zero. The products of strong measure zero sets are examined. Sharp measure zero, a notion stronger that strong measure zero, is shown to be related to meageradditive sets in the Cantor set and Polish groups by a theorem very similar to the theorem of Galvin, Mycielski and Solovay.
