If G is a locally essential subgroup of a compact abelian group K, then: (i) t(G)=w(G)=w(K), where t(G) is the tightness of G; (ii) if G is radial, then K must be metrizable; (iii) G contains a super-sequence S converging to 0 such that |S|=w(G)=w(K).   Items (i)--(iii) hold when G is a dense locally minimal subgroup of K. We show that locally minimal, locally precompact abelian groups of countable tightness are metrizable. In particular, a minimal abelian group of countable tightness is metrizable. This answers a question of O. Okunev posed in 2007.   For every uncountable cardinal kappa, we construct a Frechet-Urysohn minimal group G of character kappa such that the connected component of G is an open normal omega-bounded subgroup (thus, G is locally precompact). We also build a minimal nilpotent group of nilpotency class 2 without non-trivial convergent sequences having an open normal countably compact subgroup.
