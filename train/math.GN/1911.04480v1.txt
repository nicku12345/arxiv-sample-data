This article is devoted to the interplay between forcing with fusion and combinatorial covering properties. We discuss known instances of this interplay as well as present a new one, namely that in the Laver model for the consistency of the Borel's conjecture, the Hurewicz property is preserved by finite products of metrizable spaces.
