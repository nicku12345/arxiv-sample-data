In the paper it is shown that every Hausdorff locally compact semigroup topology on the extended bicyclic semigroup with adjoined zero \mathscr{C}_{\mathbb{Z}}^{\mathbf{0}} is discrete, but on \mathscr{C}_{\mathbb{Z}}^{\mathbf{0}} there exist \mathfrak{c} many different Hausdorff locally compact shift-continuous topologies. Also, it is constructed on \mathscr{C}_{\mathbb{Z}}^{\mathbf{0}} the unique minimal shift continuous topology and the unique minimal inverse semigroup topology.
