In this paper, we shall use the concepts of Na-open and NSa-open sets to define some new types of weakly nano continuity such as; Na-continuous, Na*-continuous, Na**-continuous, NSa-continuous, NSa*-continuous and NSa**-continuous maps. Also, we shall explain the relationships between these types of weakly nano continuity and the concepts of nano continuity. Moreover, we shall prove some theorems, properties, remarks and give counter examples about these new concepts of weakly nano continuity.
