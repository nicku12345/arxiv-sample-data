We take the abstract basis approach to classical domain theory and extend it to quantitative domains. In doing so, we provide dual characterisations of distance domains (some new even in the classical case) as well as unifying and extending previous formal ball dualities, namely the Kostanek-Waszkiewicz and Romaguero-Valero theorems. In passing, we also characterise hemimetric spaces that admit a hemimetric Smyth completion.
