The aim of this paper is to generalize some of the properties and results regarding both the coincidence point set and the common fixed point set of any two digitally continuous maps to the case of several (more than two) digitally continuous mappings. Moreover, we study how rigidity may affect these coincidence and homotopy coincidence point sets. Also, we investigate whether an established result by Staecker in Nielsen classical topology regarding the coincidence set for many maps still remains valid in the digital topological setting.
