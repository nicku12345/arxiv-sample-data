A set X endowed with a coarse structure is called ballean or coarse space. For a ballean (X, \mathcal{E}), we say that two subsets A, B of X are close (linked) if there exists an entourage E\in \mathcal{E} such that A\subseteq E [B], B\subseteq E[A] (either A, B are bounded or contain unbounded close subsets). We explore the following general question: which information about a ballean is contained and can be extracted from the relations of closeness and linkness.
