Let f:S^2\to \mathbb{R} be a Morse function on the 2-sphere and K be a connected component of some level set of f containing at least one saddle critical point. Then K is a 1-dimensional CW-complex cellularly embedded into S^2, so the complement S^2\setminus K is a union of open 2-disks D_1,\ldots, D_k. Let \mathcal{S}_{K}(f) be the group of isotopic to the identity diffeomorphisms of S^2 leaving invariant K and also each level set f^{-1}(c), c\in\mathbb{R}. Then each h\in \mathcal{S}_{K}(f) induces a certain permutation \sigma_{h} of those disks. Denote by G = \{ \sigma_h \mid h \in \mathcal{S}_{K}(f)\} be the group of all such permutations. We prove that G is isomorphic to a finite subgroup of SO(3).
