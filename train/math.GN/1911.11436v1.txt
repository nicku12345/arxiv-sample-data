Here we have studied the ideas of  sg_\lambda,s\lambda and  s\beta_\lambda -closed sets and investigated some of their properties in generalized topological spaces. We have also studied some low separation axioms namely  s\lambda T_\frac{1}{4} ,  s\lambda T_\frac{3}{8} ,  s\lambda T_\frac{1}{2}  axioms and their mutual relations with  s\lambda T_0  and s\lambda T_1  axioms.
