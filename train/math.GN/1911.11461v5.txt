We prove that if X is a regular space with no uncountable free sequences, then the tightness of its G_\delta topology is at most continuum and if X is in addition Lindel\"of then its G_\delta topology contains no free sequences of length larger then the continuum. We also show that the higher cardinal generalization of our theorem does not hold, by constructing a regular space with no free sequences of length larger than \omega_1, but whose G_\delta topology can have arbitrarily large tightness.
