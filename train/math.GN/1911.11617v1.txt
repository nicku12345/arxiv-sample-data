Based on topological Rudin's Lemma, we investigate two new kinds of sets - Rudin sets and well-filtered determined sets in T_0 topological spaces. Using such sets, we formulate and prove some new characterizations for well-filtered spaces and sober spaces. Part of the work was inspired by Xi and Lawson's work on well-filtered spaces. Our study also lead to a new class of spaces - strong d-spaces and some problems whose solutions will strengthen our understanding of the related structures.
