In this paper, we provide a direct approach to \mathbf{K}-reflections of T_0 spaces. For a full subcategory \mathbf{K} of the category of all T_0 spaces and a T_0 space X, let \mathbf{K}(X)=\{A\subseteq X : A is closed and for any continuous mapping f : X\longrightarrow Y   to a \mathbf{K}-space Y, there exists a unique y_A\in Y such that \overline{f(A)}=\overline{\{y_A\}}\} and P_H(\mathbf{K}(X)) the space of \mathbf{K}(X) endowed with the lower Vietoris topology. It is proved that if P_H(\mathbf{K}(X)) is a \mathbf{K}-space, then the pair \langle X^k=P_H(\mathbf{K}(X)), \eta_X\rangle, where \eta_X :X\longrightarrow X^k, x\mapsto\overline{\{x\}}, is the \mathbf{K}-reflection of X. We call \mathbf{K} an adequate category if for any T_0 space X, P_H(\mathbf{K}(X)) is a \mathbf{K}-space. Therefore, if \mathbf{K} is adequate, then \mathbf{K} is reflective in \mathbf{Top}_0. It is shown that the category of all sober spaces, that of all d-spaces, that of all well-filtered spaces and the Keimel and Lawson's category are all adequate, and hence are all reflective in \mathbf{Top}_0. Some major properties of \mathbf{K}-spaces and \mathbf{K}-reflections of T_0 spaces are investigated. In particular, it is proved that if \mathbf{K} is adequate, then the \mathbf{K}-reflection preserves finite products of T_0 spaces. Our study also leads to a number of problems, whose answering will deepen our understanding of the related spaces and their categorical structures.
