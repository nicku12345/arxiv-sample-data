A sequence of integers  \{ s_n \}_{n \in \mathbb{N}}  is called a T-sequence if there exists a Hausdorff group topology on  \mathbb{Z}  such that  \{ s_n \}_{n \in \mathbb{N}}  converges to zero. For every finite set of primes  S  we build a Hausdorff group topology on  \mathbb{Z}  such that every growing sequence of  S -integers converges to zero. As a corollary, we solve in the affirmative an open problem by I.V. Protasov and E.G. Zelenuk asking if  \{ 2^n + 3^n \}_{n \in \mathbb{N}}  is a T-sequence. Our results rely on a nontrivial number-theoretic fact about  S -unit equations.
