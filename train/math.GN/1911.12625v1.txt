We characterize the left-handed noncommutative frames that arise from sheaves on topological spaces. Further, we show that a general left-handed noncommutative frame A arises from a sheaf on the dissolution locale associated to the commutative shadow of A. Both constructions are made precise in terms of dual equivalences of categories, similar to the duality result for strongly distributive skew lattices in arXiv:1206.5848.
