In this paper, we discuss some properties of of G-hull, G-kernel and G-connectedness, and extend some results of \cite{life34}. In particular, we prove that the G-connectedness are preserved by countable product. Moreover, we introduce the concept of G-topological group, and prove that a G-topological group is a G-topology under the assumption of the regular method preserving the subsequence.
