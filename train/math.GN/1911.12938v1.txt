Topological gyrogroups, with a weaker algebraic structure than groups, have been investigated recently. In this paper, we prove that every feathered strongly topological gyrogroup is paracompact, which implies that every feathered strongly topological gyrogroup is a D-space and gives partial answers to two questions posed by A.V.Arhangel' ski\v\i ~(2010) in \cite{AA1}. Moreover, we prove that every locally compact NSS-gyrogroup is first-countable. Finally, we prove that each Lindel\"{o}f P-gyrogroup is Ra\check{\imath}kov complete.
