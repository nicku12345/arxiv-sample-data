We study the heredity of the classes of generalized metric spaces (for example, spaces with a \sigma-hereditarily closure-preserving k-network, spaces with a point-countable base, spaces with a base of countable order, spaces with a point-regular base, Nagata-spaces, c-semi-stratifiable spaces, \gamma-spaces, semi-metrizable spaces) to the hyperspaces of nonempty compact subsets and finite subsets with the Vietoris topology.
