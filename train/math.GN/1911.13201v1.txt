We first introduce and study two new classes of subsets in T_0 spaces - \omega-Rudin sets and \omega-well-filtered determined sets lying between the class of all closures of countable directed subsets and that of irreducible closed subsets, and two new types of spaces - \omega-d spaces and \omega-well-filtered spaces. We prove that an \omega-well-filtered T_0 space is locally compact iff it is core compact. One immediate corollary is that every core compact well-filtered space is sober, answering Jia-Jung problem with a new method. We also prove that all irreducible closed subsets in a first countable \omega-well-filtered T_0 space are directed. Therefore, a first countable T_0 space X is sober iff X is well-filtered iff X is an \omega-well-filtered d-space. Using \omega-well-filtered determined sets, we present a direct construction of the \omega-well-filtered reflections of T_0 spaces, and show that products of \omega-well-filtered spaces are \omega-well-filtered.
