We prove that on the Baire space (D^{\kappa},\pi), \kappa \geq \omega_0 where D is a uniformly discrete space having \omega _1-strongly compact cardinal and \pi denotes the product uniformity on D^\kappa, there exists a z_u-filter \mathcal{F} being Cauchy for the uniformity e\pi having as a base all the countable uniform partitions of (D^\kappa,\pi), and failing the countable intersection property. This fact is equivalent to the existence of a non-vanishing real-valued uniformly continuous function f on D^{\kappa} for which the inverse function g=1/f cannot be continuously extended to the completion of (D^{\kappa _0},e\pi). This does not happen when the cardinal of D is strictly smaller than the first Ulam-measurable cardinal.
