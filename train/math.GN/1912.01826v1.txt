Intermediate rings of real valued continuous functions with countable range on a Hausdorff zero-dimensional space X are introduced in this article. Let \Sigma_c(X) be the family of all such intermediate rings A_c(X)'s which lie between C_c^*(X) and C_c(X). It is shown that the structure space of each A_c(X) is \beta_0X, the Banaschewski compactification of X. X is shown to be a P-space if and only if each ideal in C_c(X) is closed in the m_c-topology on it. Furthermore X is realized to be an almost P-space when and only when each maximal ideal/ z-ideal in C_c(X) becomes a z^0-ideal. Incidentally within the family of almost P-spaces, C_c(X) is characterized among all the members of \Sigma_c(X) by virtue of either of these two properties. Equivalent descriptions of pseudocompact condition on X are given via U_c-topology, m_c-topology and norm on C_c(X). The article ends with a result which essentially says that z^0-ideals in a typical A_c(X) \in \Sigma_c(X) are precisely the contraction of z^0-ideals in C_c(X).
