The Golomb space \mathbb N_\tau is the set \mathbb N of positive integers endowed with the topology \tau generated by the base consisting of arithmetic progressions \{a+bn:n\ge 0\} with coprime a,b. We prove that the Golomb space \mathbb N_\tau is topologically rigid in the sense that its homeomorphism group is trivial. This resolves a problem posed by the first author at Mathoverflow in 2017.
