We construct a class of metric spaces whose transfinite asymptotic dimension and complementary-finite asymptotic dimension are both \omega+k for any k\in\mathbb{N}, where \omega is the smallest infinite ordinal number and a metric space whose transfinite asymptotic dimension and complementary-finite asymptotic dimension are both 2\omega. Moreover, we study the relationship between asymptotic dimension growth, transfinite asymptotic dimension and finite decomposition complexity.
