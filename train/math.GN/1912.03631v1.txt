Haver's near-selection theorem deals with approximate selections of Hausdorff continuous CE-valued mappings defined on \sigma-compact metrizable C-spaces. In the present paper, we extend this theorem to all paracompact C-spaces. The technique developed to achieve this generalisation is based on oriented simplicial complexes. This approach makes not only a considerable simplification in the proof but is also successful in generalising the special case of compact metric C-spaces to all paracompact finite C-spaces.
