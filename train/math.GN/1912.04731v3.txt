Let G be a non-discrete countable metrizable abelian topological group endowed with the coarse structure  \mathcal{C}  generated by compact subsets of G. We prove that asdim (G, \mathcal{C} ) = \infty. For an infinite cyclic subgroup G of the circle, this answers a question of Dikranjan and Zava [3].
