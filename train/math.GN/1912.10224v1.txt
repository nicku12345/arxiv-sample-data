A topological space is reversible if each continuous bijection of it onto itself is open. We introduce an analogue of this notion in the category of topological groups: A topological group G is g-reversible if every continuous automorphism of G (=continuous isomorphism of G onto itself) is open. The class of g-reversible groups contains Polish groups, locally compact sigma-compact groups, minimal groups, abelian groups with the Bohr topology, and reversible topological groups. We prove that subgroups of R^n are g-reversible, for every positive integer n. An example of a compact (so reversible) metric abelian group having a countable dense non-g-reversible subgroup is given. We also highlight the differences between reversible spaces and g-reversible topological groups. Many open problems are scattered throughout the paper.
