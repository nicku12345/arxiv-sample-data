In this paper for each cardinal \kappa we construct an infinite \kappa-bounded (and hence countably compact) regular space R_{\kappa} such that for any T_1 space Y of pseudo-character \leq\kappa, each continuous function f:R_{\kappa}\rightarrow Y is constant. This result resolves two problems posted by Tzannes in Open Problems from Topology Proceedings and extends results of Ciesielski and Wojciechowski and Herrlich.
