We investigate various classes of metrics on the integers, which induce the F\"urstenberg topology and establish the connection between the metrics and the topology. We analyze the norm-like mappings underlying these metrics, with respect to their efficient computability for natural numbers and the analytic behavior of sequences under those mappings. Subsequently, we give some applications to number theory and establish some new propositions at the intersection of number theory and topology.
