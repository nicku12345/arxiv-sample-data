Let {\mathcal A}\subset {\mathcal P}(X), \emptyset, X\in {\mathcal A}, {\mathcal A} being closed under finite intersections. If \psi={o},\omega,\gamma, then \Psi({\mathcal A}) is the family of those \psi-covers {\mathcal U} for which {\mathcal U}\subseteq {\mathcal A}. In~\cite{BL2} I have introduced properties (\Psi_0 of a~family F\subseteq {}^XR of real functions. The main result of the paper Theorem reads as follows: if~\Phi=\Omega,\Gamma, then for any couple \langle \Phi,\Psi\rangle different from \langle \Omega,{\mathcal O}\rangle, X has the covering property~{\rm S}{}_1(\Phi({\mathcal A}),\Psi({\mathcal A})) if and only if the family of non-negative upper {\mathcal A}-semimeasurable real functions satisfies the selection principle~{\rm S}{}_1(\Phi_0,\Psi_0). Similarly for {\rm S}{}_{\scriptstyle fin} and {\rm U}{}_{\scriptstyle fin}. Some related results are also presented.
