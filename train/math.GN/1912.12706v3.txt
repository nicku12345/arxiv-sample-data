Let F(X) be the supremum of cardinalities of free sequences in X. We prove that the radial character of every Lindel\"of Hausdorff almost radial space X and the set-tightness of every Lindel\"of Hausdorff space are always bounded above by F(X). Solving a question of Bella, we exhibit a Hausdorff radial space X whose radial character is strictly larger than F(X). We then improve a result of Dow, Juh\'asz, Soukup, Szentmikl\'ossy and Weiss by proving that if X is a Lindel\"of Hausdorff space, and X_\delta denotes the G_\delta topology on X then t(X_\delta) \leq 2^{t(X)}. Finally, we exploit this to prove that if X is a Lindel\"of Hausdorff pseudoradial space then F(X_\delta) \leq 2^{F(X)}, which partially answer a question of Bella and ourselves.
