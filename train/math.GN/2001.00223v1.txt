We show that there exist uncountably many (tall and nontall) pairwise nonisomorphic density-like ideals on \omega which are not generalized density ideals. In addition, they are nonpathological. This answers a question posed by Borodulin-Nadzieja, Farkas, and Plebanek in [J. Symb. Log. \textbf{80} (2015), 1268--1289]. Lastly, we provide sufficient conditions for a density-like ideal to be necessarily a generalized density ideal.
