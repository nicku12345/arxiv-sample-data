We show that for every Tychonoff space X and Hausdorff operation \mathbf\Phi, the class \mathbf\Phi(\mathscr Z,X) generated from zero sets in X by \mathbf\Phi has the reduction or separation property if the corresponding class \mathbf\Phi(\mathscr F,\mathbb R) of sets of reals has the same property. In particular, under Projective Determinacy, these properties of such projective sets in X have the same pattern as the First Periodicity Theorem states for projective sets of reals: the classes \mathbf\Sigma^{1}_{2n}(\mathscr Z,X) and \mathbf\Pi^{1}_{2n+1}(\mathscr Z,X) have the reduction property while \mathbf\Pi^{1}_{2n}(\mathscr Z,X) and \mathbf\Sigma^{1}_{2n+1}(\mathscr Z,X) have the separation property.
