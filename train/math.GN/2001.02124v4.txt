In this paper we investigate more characterizations and applications of \delta-strongly compact cardinals. We show that, for a cardinal \kappa the following are equivalent: (1) \kappa is \delta-strongly compact, (2) For every regular \lambda \ge \kappa there is a \delta-complete uniform ultrafilter over \lambda, and (3) Every product space of \delta-Lindel\"of spaces is \kappa-Lindel\"of. We also prove that in the Cohen forcing extension, the least \omega_1-strongly compact cardinal is a precise upper bound on the tightness of the products of two countably tight spaces.
