Inversion of various inclusions, that characterize continuity in topological spaces, results in numerous variants of quotient and perfect maps. In the framework of convergences, the said inclusions are no longer equivalent, and each of them characterizes continuity in a different concretely reflective subcategory of convergences. On the other hand, it turns out that the mentioned variants of quotient and perfect maps are quotient and perfect maps with respect to these subcategories. This perspective enables use of convergence-theoretic tools in quests related to quotient and perfect maps, considerably simplifying the traditional approach. Similar techniques would be unconceivable in the framework of topologies.
