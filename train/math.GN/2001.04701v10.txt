An approach to universal (meta-)logical reasoning in classical higher-order logic is employed to explore and study simplifications of Kurt G\"odel's modal ontological argument. Some argument premises are modified, others are dropped, modal collapse is avoided and validity is shown already in weak modal logics K and T. Key to the gained simplifications of G\"odel's original theory is the exploitation of a link to the notions of filter and ultrafilter from topology. The paper illustrates how modern knowledge representation and reasoning technology for quantified non-classical logics can contribute new knowledge to other disciplines. The contributed material is also well suited to support teaching of non-trivial logic formalisms in classroom.
