L\'evai and Pyber proposed the following as a conjecture: Let G be a profinite group such that the set of solutions of the equation x^n=1 has positive Haar measure. Then G has an open subgroup H and an element t such that all elements of the coset tH have order dividing n (see Problem 14.53 of [The Kourovka Notebook, No. 19, 2019]). The validity of the conjecture has been proved in [Arch. Math. (Basel) 75 (2000) 1-7] for n=2. Here we study the conjecture for compact groups G which are not necessarily profinite and n=3; we show that in the latter case the group G contains an open normal 2-Engel subgroup.
