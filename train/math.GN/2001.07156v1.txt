Given a hereditarily meager ideal \mathcal{I} on a countable set X we use Martin's axiom for countable posets to produce a zero-dimensional maximal topology \tau^\mathcal{I} on X such that \tau^\mathcal{I}\cap \mathcal{I}=\{\emptyset\} and, moreover, if \mathcal{I} is p^+ then \tau^\mathcal{I} is selectively separable (SS) and if \mathcal{I} is q^+, so is \tau^\mathcal{I}. In particular, we obtain regular maximal spaces satisfying all boolean combinations of the properties SS and q^+.
