A locale, being a complete Heyting algebra, satisfies De Morgan law (a\vee b)^*=a^*\wedge b^* for pseudocomplements. The dual De Morgan law (a\wedge b)^*={a^* \vee b^*} (here referred to as the second De Morgan law) is equivalent to, among other conditions, (a\vee b)^{**} =a^{**}\vee b^{**}, and characterizes the class of extremally disconnected locales. This paper presents a study of the subclasses of extremally disconnected locales determined by the infinite versions of the second De Morgan law and its equivalents.
