Let \mathcal{I} be a meager ideal on \mathbf{N}. We show that if x is a sequence with values in a separable metric space then the set of subsequences [resp. permutations] of x which preserve the set of \mathcal{I}-cluster points of x is topologically large if and only if every ordinary limit point of x is also an \mathcal{I}-cluster point of x. The analogue statement fails for all maximal ideals. This extends the main results in [Topology Appl. \textbf{263} (2019), 221--229]. As an application, if x is a sequence with values in a first countable compact space which is \mathcal{I}-convergent to \ell, then the set of subsequences [resp. permutations] which are \mathcal{I}-convergent to \ell is topologically large if and only if x is convergent to \ell in the ordinary sense. Analogous results hold for \mathcal{I}-limit points, provided \mathcal{I} is an analytic P-ideal.
