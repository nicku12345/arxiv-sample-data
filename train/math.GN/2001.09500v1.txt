The well-known Eckmann-Hilton Principle may be applied to prove that fundamental groups of H-spaces are commutative. In this paper, we identify an infinitary analogue of the Eckmann-Hilton Principle that applies to fundamental groups of all topological monoids and slightly more general objects called pre-\Delta-monoids. In particular, we show that every pre-\Delta-monoid M is "transfinitely \pi_1-commutative" in the sense that permutation of the factors of any infinite loop-concatenation indexed by a countably infinite order and based at the identity e\in M is a homotopy invariant action. We also give a detailed account of fundamental groups of James reduced products and apply transfinite \pi_1-commutativity to make several computations.
