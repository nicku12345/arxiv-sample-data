Let \Sigma (X,\mathbb{C}) denote the collection of all the rings between C^*(X,\mathbb{C}) and C(X,\mathbb{C}). We show that there is a natural correlation between the absolutely convex ideals/ prime ideals/maximal ideals/z-ideals/z^\circ-ideals in the rings P(X,\mathbb{C}) in \Sigma(X,\mathbb{C}) and in their real-valued counterparts P(X,\mathbb{C})\cap C(X). It is shown that the structure space of any such P(X,\mathbb{C}) is \beta X. We show that for any maximal ideal M in C(X,\mathbb{C}), C(X,\mathbb{C})/M is an algebraically closed field. We give a necessary and sufficient condition for the ideal C_{\mathcal{P}}(X,\mathbb{C}) of C(X,\mathbb{C}) to be a prime ideal, and we examine a few special cases thereafter.
