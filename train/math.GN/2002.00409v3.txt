For any compact Hausdorff space K we construct a canonical finitary coarse structure \mathcal E_{X,K} on the set X of isolated points of K. This construction has two properties:   \bullet If a finitary coarse space (X,\mathcal E) is metrizable, then its coarse structure \mathcal E coincides with the coarse structure \mathcal E_{X,\bar X} generated by the Higson compactification \bar X of X;   \bullet A compact Hausdorff space K coincides with the Higson compactification of the coarse space (X,\mathcal E_{X,K}) if the set X is dense in K and the space K is Frechet-Urysohn.   This implies that a compact Hausdorff space K is homeomorphic to the Higson corona of some finitary coarse space if one of the following conditions holds: (i) K is perfectly normal; (ii) K has weight w(K)\le\omega_1 and character \chi(K)<\mathfrak p. Under CH every (zero-dimensional) compact Hausdorff space of weight \le\omega_1 is homeomorphic to the Higson (resp. binary) corona of some cellular finitary coarse space.
