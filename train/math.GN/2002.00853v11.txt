We prove that the meandering set for f_a(z)=e^z+a is homeomorphic to the space of irrational numbers whenever a belongs to the Fatou set of f_a. This extends recent results by Vasiliki Evdoridou and Lasse Rempe. It implies that the radial Julia set of f_a has topological dimension zero for all attracting and parabolic parameters, including all a\in (-\infty,-1]. Similar results are obtained for Fatou's function f(z)=z+1+e^{-z}.
