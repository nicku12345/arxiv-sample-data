We unify various \'etale groupoid reconstruction theorems such as:   1) Kumjian-Renault's reconstruction from a groupoid C*-algebra.   2) Exel's reconstruction from an ample inverse semigroup.   3) Steinberg's reconstruction from a groupoid ring.   4) Choi-Gardella-Thiel's reconstruction from a groupoid L^p-algebra.   We do this by working with certain bumpy semigroups S of functions defined on an \'etale groupoid G. The semigroup structure of S together with the diagonal subsemigroup D then yields a natural domination relation < on S. The groupoid of <-ultrafilters is then isomorphic to the original groupoid G.
