A product of compact normal spaces is normal; the product of a countably infinite collection of non-trivial spaces is normal if and only if it is countably paracompact and each of its finite sub-products is normal; if all powers of a space X are normal then X is compact: provided in each case that the spaces involved are T1. Here I examine the situation for infinite products not required to be T1 (or regular), extending or generalizing each of these facts. In addition, I prove some related results, give a number of examples, explore some alternative proofs, and close with some speculation regarding potential applications of these findings to category theory and lattice theory.
