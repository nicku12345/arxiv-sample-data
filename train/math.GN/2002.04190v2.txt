One can use the number theoretic idea of the notion of natural density \cite{B1} to define topological s-torsion elements (which form the statistically characterized subgroups, recently developed in \cite{DPK}) extending Armacost's idea of topological torsion elements. We follow in the line of Armacost who had posed the famous classical problem for "description of topological torsion elements" of the circle group. In this note we consider the natural density version of Armacost's problem and present a complete description of topological s-torsion elements in terms of the support, for all arithmetic sequences which also provides the solution of Problem 6.10 posed in \cite{DPK} .
