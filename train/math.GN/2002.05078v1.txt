We have defined almost separable space. We show that like separability, almost separability is c productive and converse also true under some restrictions. We establish a Baire Category theorem like result in Hausdorff, Pseudocompacts spaces. We investigate few relationships among separability, almost separability, sequential separability, strongly sequential separability.
