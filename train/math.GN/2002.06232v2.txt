A topological group X is called duoseparable if there exists a countable set S\subseteq X such that SUS=X for any neighborhood U\subseteq X of the unit. We construct a functor F assigning to each (abelian) topological group X a duoseparable (abelain-by-cyclic) topological group FX, containing an isomorphic copy of X. In fact, the functor F is defined on the category of unital topologized magmas. Also we prove that each \sigma-compact locally compact abelian topological group embeds into a duoseparable locally compact abelian-by-countable topological group.
