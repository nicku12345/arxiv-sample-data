We prove that every homogeneous countable dense homogeneous topological space containing a copy of the Cantor set is a Baire space. In particular, every countable dense homogeneous topological vector space is a Baire space. It follows that, for any nondiscrete metrizable space X, the function space C_p(X) is not countable dense homogeneous. This answers a question posed recently by R. Hern\'andez-Guti\'errez. We also conclude that, for any infinite dimensional Banach space E (dual Banach space E^\ast), the space E equipped with the weak topology (E^\ast with the weak^\ast topology) is not countable dense homogeneous. We generalize some results of Hru\v{s}\'ak, Zamora Avil\'es, and Hern\'andez-Guti\'errez concerning countable dense homogeneous products.
