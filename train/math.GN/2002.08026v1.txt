In this paper we focus on the set-open topologies on the group \mathcal{H}(X) of all self-homeomorphisms of a topological space X which yield continuity of both the group operations, product and inverse function. As a consequence, we make the more general case of Dijkstra's theorem. In this case a homogeneously encircling family \mathcal{B} consists of regular open sets and the closure of every set from \mathcal{B} is contained in the finite union of connected sets from \mathcal{B}. Also we proved that the zero-cozero topology of \mathcal{H}(X) is the relativisation to \mathcal{H}(X) of the compact-open topology of \mathcal{H}(\beta X) for any Tychonoff space X and every homogeneous zero-dimensional space X can be represented as the quotient space of a topological group with respect to a closed subgroup.
