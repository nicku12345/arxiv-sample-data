We show that every connected graph can be approximated by a normal tree, up to some arbitrarily small error phrased in terms of neighbourhoods around its ends. The existence of such approximate normal trees has consequences of both combinatorial and topological nature.   On the combinatorial side, we show that a graph has a normal spanning tree as soon as it has normal spanning trees locally at each end; i.e., the only obstruction for a graph to having a normal spanning tree is an end for which none of its neighbourhoods has a normal spanning tree.   On the topological side, we show that the end space \Omega(G), as well as the spaces |G| = G \cup \Omega(G) naturally associated with a graph G, are always paracompact. This gives unified and short proofs for a number of results by Diestel, Spr\"ussel and Polat, and answers an open question about metrizability of end spaces by Polat.
