To any compact K\subset\hat{\mathbb{C}} we associate a map \lambda_K: \hat{\mathbb{C}}\rightarrow\mathbb{N}\cup\{\infty\} --- the lambda function of K --- such that a planar continuum K is locally connected if and only if \Lambda_K(x)\equiv0. We establish basic methods of determining the lambda function \lambda_K for specific compacta K\subset\hat{\bbC}, including a gluing lemma for lambda functions and some inequalities. One of these inequalities comes from an interplay between the topological difficulty of a planar compactum K and that of a sub-compactum L\subset K, lying on the boundary of a component of \hat{\mathbb{C}}\setminus K. It generalizes and quantifies the result of Torhorst Theorem, a fundamental result from plane topology. We also find three conditions under which this inequality is actually an equality. Under one of these conditions, this equality provides a quantitative version for Whyburn's Theorem, which is a partial converse to Torhorst Theorem.
