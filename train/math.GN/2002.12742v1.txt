In this paper, we characterize stratifiable (or semi-stratifiable) spaces, and monotonically countably paracompact (or monotonically countably metacompact) spaces by expansions of locally upper bounded semi-continuous poset-valued maps. These extend earlier results for real-valued Locally bounded functions.
