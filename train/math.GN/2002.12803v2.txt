This paper is a continuation of [17] where we introduced the basic framework of nonstandard large-scale topology. In the present paper, we apply our framework to various topics in large-scale topology: spaces interacting with both small-scale and large-scale structures, large-scale structures on nonstandard extensions, size properties of subsets of coarse spaces, and coarse hyperspaces.
