Carmesin has extended Robertson and Seymour's tree-of-tangles theorem to the infinite tangles of locally finite infinite graphs. We extend it further to the infinite tangles of all infinite graphs.   Our result has a number of applications for the topology of infinite graphs, such as their end spaces and their compactifications.
