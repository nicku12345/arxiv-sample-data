Topological gyrogroups, with a weaker algebraic structure without associative law, have been investigated recently. We prove that each T_{0}-strongly topological gyrogroup is completely regular. We also prove that every T_{0}-strongly topological gyrogroup with a countable pseudocharacter is submetrizable. Finally, we prove that the left coset space G/H is submetrizable if H is an admissible L-subgyrogroup of a T_{0}-strongly topological gyrogroup G.
