In this paper, we provide a uniform approach to d-spaces, sober spaces and well-filtered spaces, and develop a general framework for dealing with all these spaces. For a subset system H, the theory of H-sober spaces and super H-sober spaces is established, and a direct construction of the H-sobrifcations and super H-sobrifications of T_0 spaces is given. Therefore, the category of all H-sober spaces is reflective in \mathbf{Top}_0, and the category of all super H-sober spaces is also reflective in \mathbf{Top}_0 if H has a natural property (called property M). It is shown that the H-sobrification preserves finite products of T_0 spaces, and the super H-sobrification preserves finite products of T_0 spaces if H has property M.
