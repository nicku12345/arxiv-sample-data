For a given compact Hausdorff space X, we construct the space OS_{f}(X) of normed, order-preserving, weakly additive, positively homogeneous and semi-additive functionals (for brevity, semi-additive functionals) and it is proved that the hyperspace \exp\, X of the space X is a deformation retract of the constructed space. Further we show that the shapes of the spaces OS_{f}(X) and \exp\, X coincide. We establish that if the space \exp\, X is contractible, then the space OS_{f}(X) is also contractible.
