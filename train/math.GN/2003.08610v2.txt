This paper considers some extensions of the notion of filter to the quantale-valued context, including saturated prefilter, \top-filter and bounded saturated prefilter. The question is whether these constructions give rise to monads on the category of sets. It is shown that the answer depends on the structure of the quantale. Specifically, if the quantale is the unit interval equipped with a continuous t-norm, then these constructions give rise to monads if and only if the implication operator corresponding to that t-norm is continuous at each point off the diagonal.
