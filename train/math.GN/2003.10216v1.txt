Utility representations of preference relations in symmetric topological spaces have the advantage of fully characterising these relations. But, this is not true in the case of representations of preference relations that are mostly incomplete and use asymmetric topologies. In order to avoid this unfortunate circumstance, due to lack of symmetry, the notion of semicontinuous Richter-Peleg multi-utility representation was first introduced and studied by Minguzzi [24]. Generally, the study of semicontinuous functions reveals that topology and order are two aspects of the same mathematical object and, therefore, should be studied jointly. This mathematical object is the notion of bitopological preordered space, which also constitutes the mathematical tool to model and analyse the notions of asymmetry and duality. In this paper, we characterize the existence of semicontinuous Richter-Peleg multi-utility representations in bitopological spaces. Based on this characterization, we prove that a preorder \precsim has the set of all Scott and \omega-continuous functions as Richter-Peleg multi-utility representation if and only if \precsim is precontinuous in the sense of Erne [17].
