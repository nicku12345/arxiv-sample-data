We show three basic properties on the image Milnor number \mu_I(f) of a germ f\colon(\mathbb{C}^{n},S)\rightarrow(\mathbb{C}^{n+1},0) with isolated instability. First, we show the conservation of the image Milnor number, from which one can deduce the upper semi-continuity and the topological invariance for families. Second, we prove the weak Mond's conjecture, which says that \mu_I(f)=0 if and only if f is stable. Finally, we show a conjecture by Houston that any family f_t\colon(\mathbb{C}^{n},S)\rightarrow(\mathbb{C}^{n+1},0) with \mu_I(f_t) constant is excellent in Gaffney's sense. By technical reasons, in the two last properties we consider only the corank 1 case.
