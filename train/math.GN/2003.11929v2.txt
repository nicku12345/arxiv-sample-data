We deal with the question of Masayoshi Hata: is every Peano continuum a topological fractal? A compact space X is a topological fractal if there exists \mathcal{F} a finite family of self-maps on X such that X=\bigcup_{f\in\mathcal{F}}f(X) and for every open cover \mathcal{U} of X there is n\in\mathbb{N} such that for any maps f_1,\dots,f_n\in\mathcal{F} the set f_1\circ\dots\circ f_n(X) is contained in some set U\in\mathcal{U}.   In the paper we present some idea how to extend topological fractal and we use it to show that a Peano continuum is a topological fractal if it contains so-called regenerating fractal with nonempty interior. A Hausdorff topological space A is a regenerating fractal if for every non-empty open subset U, A is a topological fractal for some family of maps constant on A\setminus U.   The notion of regenerating fractal much better reflects the intuitive perception of self-similarity. We present some classical fractals which are regenerating.
