For a coarse space (X, \mathcal{E}), X^\sharp denotes the set of all unbounded ultrafilters on X endowed with the parallelity relation: p||q if there exists E \in \mathcal{E}  such that  E[P]\in q  for each P\in p. If (X, \mathcal{E}) is finitary then there exists a group G  of permutations of X such that the coarse structure \mathcal{E} has the base \{\{ (x,gx): x\in X, g\in F\}: F\in [G]^{<\omega}, \ id \in F \}. We survey and analyze interplays between (X, \mathcal{E}), X^\sharp and the dynamical system (G, X^\sharp).
