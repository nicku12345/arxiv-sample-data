In this article, we continue our study of the ring of Baire one functions on a topological space (X,\tau), denoted by B_1(X) and extend the well known M. H. Stones's theorem from C(X) to B_1(X). Introducing the structure space of B_1(X), an analogue of Gelfand Kolmogoroff theorem is established. It is observed that (X,\tau) may not be embedded inside the structure space of B_1(X). This observation inspired us to introduce a weaker form of embedding and show that in case X is a T_4 space, X is weakly embedded as a dense subspace, in the structure space of B_1(X). It is further established that the ring B_1^{*}(X) of all bounded Baire one functions is a C-type ring and also, the structure space of B_1^{*}(X) is homeomorphic to the structure space of B_1(X). Introducing a finer topology \sigma than the original T_4 topology \tau on X, it is proved that B_1(X) contains free (maximal) ideals if \sigma is strictly finer than \tau. It is also proved that \tau = \sigma if and only if B_1(X) = C(X). Moreover, in the class of all perfectly normal T_1 spaces, B_1(X) = C(X) is equivalent to the discreteness of the space X.
