Each continuous weak selection for a space X defines a coarser topology on X, called a selection topology. Spaces whose topology is determined by a collection of such selection topologies are called continuous weak selection spaces. For such spaces, Garc\'{\i}a-Ferreira, Miyazaki, Nogura and Tomita considered the minimal number \text{cws}(X) of selection topologies which generate the original topology of X, and called it the cws-number of X. In this paper, we show that \text{cws}(X)\leq 2 for every semi-orderable space X, and that \text{cws}(X)=2 precisely when such a space X has two components and is not orderable. Complementary to this result, we also show that \text{cws}(X)=1 for each suborderable metrizable space X which has at least 3 components.
