We provide an interpolation theorem of a family of metrics defined on closed subsets of metrizable spaces. As an application, we observe that various sets of all metrics with properties appeared in metric geometry are dense intersections of countable open subsets in spaces of metrics on metrizable spaces. For instance, our study is applicable to the set of all non-doubling metrics and the set of all non-uniformly disconnected metrics.
