The Game of Cycles, introduced by Su (2020), is played on a simple connected planar graph together with its bounded cells, and players take turns marking edges with arrows according to a sink-source rule that gives the game a topological flavor. The object of the game is to produce a cycle cell---a cell surrounded by arrows all cycling in one direction---or to make the last possible move. We analyze the two-player game for various classes of graphs and determine who has a winning strategy. We also establish a topological property of the game: that a board with every edge marked must have a cycle cell.
