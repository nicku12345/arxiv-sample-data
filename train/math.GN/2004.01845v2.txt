In this paper we develop the theory of Artin-Wraith glueing for topological spaces. As an application, we show that some categories of compactifications of coarse spaces that agrees with the coarse structures are invariant under coarse equivalences. As a consequence, we have that if a space Z is the coproduct of a family \{C_{i}\}_{i \in \Gamma} of Hausdorff compact spaces, then the category of compactifications of \Gamma, with discrete topology, is isomorphic to a full subcategory of the category of compactifications of Z. As an another application, we show that for every compact metrizable space Y, there exists only one, up to homeomorphisms, compactification of the Cantor set minus one point such that the remainder is homeomorphic to Y.
