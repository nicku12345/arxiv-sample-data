In this paper we collect some open set-theoretic problems that appear in the large-scale topology (called also Asymptology). In particular we ask problems about critical cardinalities of some special (large, indiscrete, inseparated) coarse structures on \omega, about the interplay between properties of a coarse space and its Higson corona, about some special ultrafilters (T-points and cellular T-points) related to finitary coarse structures on \omega, about partitions of coarse spaces into thin pieces, and also about coarse groups having some extremal properties.
