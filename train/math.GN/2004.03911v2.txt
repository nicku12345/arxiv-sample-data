A Tychonoff space X is called ({\em sequentially}) {\em Ascoli} if every compact subset (resp. convergent sequence) of C_k(X) is equicontinuous, where C_k(X) denotes the space of all real-valued continuous functions on X endowed with the compact-open topology. The classical Ascoli theorem states that each compact space is Ascoli. We show that a pseudocompact space X is Asoli iff it is sequentially Ascoli iff it is selectively \omega-bounded.
