In 2018 Liuquan Wang and Yifan Yang proved the existence of an infinite family of congruences for the smallest parts function corresponding to the third order mock theta function \omega(q). Their proof took the form of an induction requiring 20 initial relations, and utilized a space of modular functions isomorphic to a free rank 2 \mathbb{Z}[X]-module. This proof strategy was originally developed by Paule and Radu to study families of congruences associated with modular curves of genus 1. We show that Wang and Yang's family of congruences, which is associated with a genus 0 modular curve, can be proved using a single-variable approach, via a ring of modular functions isomorphic to a localization of \mathbb{Z}[X]. To our knowledge, this is the first time that such an algebraic structure has been applied to the theory of partition congruences. Our induction is more complicated, and relies on sequences of functions which exhibit a somewhat irregular 5-adic growth. However, the proof ultimately rests upon the direct verification of only 10 initial relations, and is similar to the classical methods of Ramanujan and Watson.
