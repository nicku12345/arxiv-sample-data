Let \sum (X) be the collection of subalgebras of C(X) containing C^{*}(X), where X is a Tychonoff space. For any A(X)\in \sum(X) there is associated a subset \upsilon_{A}(X) of \beta X which is an A-analogue of the Hewitt real compactification \upsilon X of X. For any A(X)\in \sum(X), let [A(X)] be the class of all B(X)\in \sum(X) such that \upsilon_{A}(X)=\upsilon_{B}(X). We have shown that for first countable non compact real compact space X, [A(X)] contains at least 2^{c} many different subalgebras no two of which are isomorphic.
