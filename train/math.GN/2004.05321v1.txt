Let Y be a metrizable space containing at least two points, and let X be a Y_{\mathcal{I}}-Tychonoff space for some ideal \mathcal{I} of compact sets of X. Denote by C_{\mathcal{I}}(X,Y) the space of continuous functions from X to Y endowed with the \mathcal{I}-open topology. We prove that C_{\mathcal{I}}(X,Y) is Fr\'{e}chet - Urysohn iff X has the property \gamma_{\mathcal{I}}. We characterize zero - dimensional Tychonoff spaces X for which the space C_{\mathcal{I}}(X,{\bf 2}) is sequential. Extending the classical theorems of Gerlits, Nagy and Pytkeev we show that if Y is not compact, then C_{p}(X,Y) is Fr\'{e}chet - Urysohn iff it is sequential iff it is a k-space iff X has the property \gamma. An analogous result is obtained for the space of bounded continuous functions taking values in a metrizable locally convex space. Denote by B_{1}(X,Y) and B(X,Y) the space of Baire one functions and the space of all Baire functions from X to Y, respectively. If H is a subspace of B(X,Y) containing B_{1}(X,Y), then H is metrizable iff it is a \sigma - space iff it has countable cs^* - character iff X is countable. If additionally Y is not compact, then H is Fr\'{e}chet - Urysohn iff it is sequential iff it is a k - space iff it has countable tightness iff X_{\aleph_0} has the property \gamma, where X_{\aleph_0} is the space X with the Baire topology. We show that if X is a Polish space, then the space B_{1}(X,\mathbb{R}) is normal iff X is countable.
