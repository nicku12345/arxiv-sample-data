Internal preneighbourhood spaces were initiated in \cite{2020}{.} The present paper introduces a closure operator on an internal preneighbourhood space of a finitely complete category with finite coproducts and a proper (\mathsf{E}, \mathsf{M}) system. The closure operator is shown to be grounded, idempotent, additive (if every filter of admissible subobjects is contained in a prime filter), hereditary, transitive, and satisfy \emph{finite structure preservation property} whenever product projections are \mathsf{E}-morphisms. The closure operator agrees with the usual closure operators for topological spaces and locales. The paper discuss closed morphisms, dense morphisms, proper morphisms, separated morphisms and perfect morphisms. Alongwith the paper introduces special classes of internal preneighbourhood spaces, namely the compact spaces, Hausdorff spaces, compact Hausdorff spaces, Tychonoff spaces and absolutely closed spaces.
