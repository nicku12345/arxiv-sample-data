Let (X,\tau) be a Hausdorff space and n\in\omega. We prove that if X admits a continuous selection over \mathcal{F}_{n}(X) (nonempty subsets of X of cardinality at most n), then for every n\leq m\leq 2n such that m is not a prime number, X admits a continuous selection over [X]^m (subsets of X of cardinality m). As a consequence of this, a space X admits a continuous selection for every natural number if and only if the same is true for every prime number. For Hausdorff spaces (X,\tau) which admit continuous selections over [X]^2, we characterize the existence of continuous selections over [X]^n for n\geq 2, in terms of a covering-type property.
