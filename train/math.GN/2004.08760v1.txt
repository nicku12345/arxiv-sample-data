We show that all maximal almost disjoint families have pseudocompact Vietoris hyperspace if and only if \mathsf{MA}_\mathfrak c (\mathcal P(\omega)/\mathrm{fin}) holds. We further study the question whether there is a maximal almost disjoint family whose hyperspace is pseudocompact and prove that consistently such families do not exist \emph{genericaly}, by constructing a consistent example of a maximal almost disjoint family \mathcal A of size less than \mathfrak c whose hyperspace is not pseudocompact.
