Miller, Stibich and Moore (2010) developed a set-valued coarse invariant \sigma\left(X,\xi\right) of pointed metric spaces. DeLyser, LaBuz and Tobash (2013) provided a different way to construct \sigma\left(X,\xi\right) (as the set of all sequential ends). This paper provides yet another definition of \sigma\left(X,\xi\right). To do this, we introduce a metric on the set S\left(X,\xi\right) of coarse maps \left(\mathbb{N},0\right)\to\left(X,\xi\right), and prove that \sigma\left(X,\xi\right) is equal to the set of coarsely connected components of S\left(X,\xi\right). As a by-product, our reformulation trivialises some known theorems on \sigma\left(X,\xi\right), including the functoriality and the coarse invariance.
