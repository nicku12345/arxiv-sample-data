A cuf space (set, resp.) is a space (set, resp.) which is a countable union of finite subspaces (subsets, resp.). It is proved in \mathbf{ZF} (with the absence of the axiom of choice) that all countable unions of cuf (denumerable, resp.) sets are cuf sets iff all countable products of cofinite cuf (denumerable, resp.) spaces are quasi-metrizable iff all countable products of one-point Hausdorff compactifications of infinite cuf (denumerable, resp.) spaces are quasi-metrizable. A countable product of one-point Hausdorff compactifications of denumerable discrete spaces is first-countable iff it is quasi-metrizable. A model of \mathbf{ZF} is shown in which a countable product two-point Hausdorff compactifications of denumerable discrete spaces is first-countable without being quasi-metrizable. Other relevant independence results are also proved.
