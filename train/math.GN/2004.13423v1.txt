For a topological space X we propose to call a subset S \subset X "free in X" if it admits a well-ordering that turns it into a free sequence in X. The well-known cardinal function F(X) is then definable as \sup\{|S| : S \text{ is free in } X\} and will be called the free set number of X.   We prove several new inequalities involving F(X) and F(X_\delta), where X_\delta is the G_{\delta}-modification of X:   \bullet L(X) \le 2^{2^{F(X)}} if X is T_2 and L(X)\le 2^{F(X)} if X is T_3;   \bullet |X|\le 2^{2^{F(X) \cdot \psi_c(X)}} \le 2^{2^{F(X) \cdot \chi(X)}} for any T_2-space X;   \bullet F(X_{\delta})\le 2^{2^{2^{F(X)}}} if X is T_2 and F(X_{\delta})\le 2^{2^{F(X)}} if X is T_3.
