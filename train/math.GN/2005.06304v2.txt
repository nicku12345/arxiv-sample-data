Based on Garner's discovery that topological categories are total categories enriched in a quantaloid, this paper presents a series of results related to initial and final density in categorical topology via (co)density in quantaloid-enriched categories, focusing on (co-)Sierpi\'{n}ski objects, Galois correspondences and their fixed points.
