In this article, we consider the generalized version d^f_g of the natural density function introduced in \cite{BDK} where g : \N \rightarrow [0,\infty) satisfies g(n) \rightarrow \infty and \frac{n}{g(n)} \nrightarrow 0 whereas f is an unbounded modulus function and generate versions of characterized subgroups of the circle group \T using these density functions. We show that these subgroups have the same feature as the s-characterized subgroups \cite{DDB} or \alpha-characterized subgroups \cite{BDH} and our results provide more general versions of the main results of both the articles. But at the same time the utility of this more general approach is justified by constructing new and nontrivial subgroups for suitable choice of f and g. In several of our results we use properties of the ideal \iZ_g(f) which are first presented along with certain new observations about these ideals which were not there in \cite{BDK}.
