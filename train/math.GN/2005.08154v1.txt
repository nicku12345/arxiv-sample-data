The symbol \mathcal{S}(X) denotes the hyperspace of finite unions of convergent sequences in a Hausdorff space X. This hyperspace is endowed with the Vietoris topology. First of all, we give a characterization of convergent sequence in \mathcal{S}(X). Then we consider some cardinal invariants on \mathcal{S}(X), and compare the character, the pseudocharacter, the sn-character, the so-character, the network weight and cs-network weight of \mathcal{S}(X) with the corresponding cardinal function of X. Moreover, we consider rank k-diagonal on \mathcal{S}(X), and give a space X with a rank 2-diagonal such that S(X) does not have any G_{\delta}-diagonal. Further, we study the relations of some generalized metric properties of X and its hyperspace \mathcal{S}(X). Finally, we pose some questions about the hyperspace \mathcal{S}(X).
