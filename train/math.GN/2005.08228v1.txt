We construct C*-diagonals with connected spectra in all classifiable stably finite C*-algebras which are unital or stably projectionless with continuous scale. For classifiable stably finite C*-algebras with torsion-free K_0 and trivial K_1, we further determine the spectra of the C*-diagonals up to homeomorphism. In the unital case, the underlying space turns out to be the Menger curve. In the stably projectionless case, the space is obtained by removing a non-locally-separating copy of the Cantor space from the Menger curve. We show that each of our classifiable C*-algebras has continuum many pairwise non-conjugate such Menger manifold C*-diagonals. Along the way, we also obtain a complete classification of C*-diagonals in all one-dimensional non-commutative CW complexes.
