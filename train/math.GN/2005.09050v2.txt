We give the topological obstructions to be a leaf in a minimal lamination by hyperbolic surfaces whose generic leaf is homeomorphic to a Cantor tree. Then, we show that all allowed topological types can be simultaneously embedded in the same lamination. This result, together with results of Alvarez-Brum-Mart\'inez-Potrie and Blanc, complete the panorama of understanding which topological surfaces can be leaves in minimal hyperbolic surface laminations when the topology of the generic leaf is given. In all cases, all possible topologies can be realized simultaneously.
