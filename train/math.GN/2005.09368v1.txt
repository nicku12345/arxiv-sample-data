We show that (in ZFC) every infinite set S can be equipped with 2^|S| complete metrics which generate mutually non-homeomorphic scattered order topologies on S. Furthermore, we show that (in ZFC) every uncountable set S can be equipped with 2^|S| mutually non-homeomorphic scattered and compact order topologies. (This would be unprovable in ZFC for countably infinite S.) In both enumeration theorems the cardinality 2^|S| is optimal.
