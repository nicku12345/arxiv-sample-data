The reduced ring order (rr-order) is a natural partial order on a reduced ring R given by r\le_{\text{rr}} s if r^2=rs. It can be studied algebraically or topologically in rings of the form \text{C}(X). The focus here is on those reduced rings in which each pair of elements has an infimum in the rr-order, and what this implies for X. A space X is called rr-good if \text{C}(X) has this property. Surprisingly both locally connected and basically disconnected spaces share this property. The rr-good property is studied under various topological conditions including its behaviour under Cartesian products. The product of two rr-good spaces can fail to be rr-good (e.g., \beta \mathbf{R}\times \beta \mathbf{R}), however, the product of a P-space and an rr-good weakly Lindel\"of space is always rr-good. P-spaces, F-spaces and U-spaces play a role, as do Glicksberg's theorem and work by Comfort, Hindman and Negrepontis.
