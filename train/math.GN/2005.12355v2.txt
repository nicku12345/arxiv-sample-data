Let \mathscr{F}=(F_n) be a sequence of nonempty finite subsets of \omega such that \lim_n |F_n|=\infty and define the ideal \mathcal{I}(\mathscr{F}):=\left\{A\subseteq \omega: |A\cap F_n|/|F_n|\to 0~\mbox{as}~n\to \infty \right\}. The case F_n=\{1,\ldots,n\} corresponds to the classical case of density zero ideal. We show that \mathcal{I}(\mathscr{F}) is an analytic P-ideal but not F_{\sigma}. As a consequence, we show that the set of real bounded sequences which are \mathcal{I}(\mathscr{F})-convergent to 0 is not complemented in \ell_\infty.
