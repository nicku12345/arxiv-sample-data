We pose the following new variant of the Kuratowski closure-complement problem: How many distinct sets may be obtained by starting with a set A of a Polish space X, and applying only closure, complementation, and the d operator, as often as desired, in any order? The set operator d was studied by Kuratowski in his foundational text \textit{Topology: Volume I}; it assigns to A the collection dA of all points of second category for A. We show that in ZFC set theory, the answer to this variant problem is 22. In a distinct system equiconsistent with ZFC, namely ZF+DC+PB, the answer is only 18.
