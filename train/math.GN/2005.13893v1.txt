Consider a connected topological space X with a point x \in X and let K be a field with the discrete topology. We study the Tannakian category of finite dimensional (flat) vector bundles on X and its Tannakian dual \pi_K (X,x) with respect to the fibre functor in x. The maximal pro-\'etale quotient of \pi_K (X,x) is the \'etale fundamental group of X studied by Kucharczyk and Scholze. For well behaved topological spaces, \pi_K (X,x) is the pro-algebraic completion of the ordinary fundamental group \pi_1 (X,x).   We obtain some structural results on \pi_K (X,x) by studying (pseudo-)torsors attached to its quotients. This approach uses ideas of Nori in algebraic geometry and a result of Deligne on Tannakian categories. We also calculate \pi_K (X,x) for some generalized solenoids.
