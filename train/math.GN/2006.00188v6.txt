If X is a finite tree and f \colon X \longrightarrow X is a map, as the Main Theorem of this paper we find eight conditions, each of which is equivalent to the fact that f is equicontinuous. To name just a few of the results obtained: the equicontinuity of f is equivalent to the fact that there is no arc A \subseteq X satisfying A \subsetneq f^n[A] for some n\in \mathbb{N}. It is also equivalent to the fact that for some nonprincial ultrafilter u, the function f^u \colon X \longrightarrow X is continuous (in other words, failure of equicontinuity of f is equivalent to the failure of continuity of every element of the Ellis remainder g\in E(X,f)^*). One of the tools used in the proofs is the Ramsey-theoretic result known as Hindman's theorem. Our results generalize the ones shown by Vidal-Escobar and Garc\'ia-Ferreira, and complement those of Bruckner and Ceder, Mai, and Camargo, Rinc\'on and Uzc\'ategui.
