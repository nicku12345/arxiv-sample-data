In this paper we give conditions under which a topological semigroup can be embedded algebraically and topologically into a compact topological group. We prove that every feebly compact regular first countable cancellative commutative topological semigroup with open shifts is a topological group, as well as every connected locally compact Hausdorff cancellative commutative topological monoid with open shifts. Finally, we use these results to give sufficient conditions on a topological semigroup that guarantee it to have countable cellularity.
