Let \Delta be a foliation on a topological manifold X, Y be the space of leaves, and p: X \to Y be the natural projection. Endow Y with the factor topology with respect to p. Then the group \mathcal{H}(X, \Delta) of foliated (i.e. mapping leaves onto leaves) homeomorphisms of X naturally acts on the space of leaves Y, which gives a homomorphism \psi: \mathcal{H}(X, \Delta) \to \mathcal{H}(Y). We present sufficient conditions when \psi is continuous with respect to the corresponding compact open topologies. In fact similar results hold not only for foliations but for a more general class of partitions \Delta of locally compact Hausdorff spaces X.
