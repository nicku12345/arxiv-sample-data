We study a natural generalization of covering projections defined in terms of unique lifting properties. A map p:E\to X has the "continuous path-covering property" if all paths in X lift uniquely and continuously (rel. basepoint) with respect to the compact-open topology. We show that maps with this property are closely related to fibrations with totally path-disconnected fibers and to the natural quotient topology on the homotopy groups. In particular, the class of maps with the continuous path-covering property lies properly between Hurewicz fibrations and Serre fibrations with totally path-disconnected fibers. We extend the usual classification of covering projections to a classification of maps with the continuous path-covering property in terms of topological \pi_1: for any path-connected Hausdorff space X, maps E\to X with the continuous path-covering property are classified up to weak equivalence by subgroups H\leq \pi_1(X,x_0) with totally path-disconnected coset space \pi_1(X,x_0)/H. Here, "weak equivalence" refers to an equivalence relation generated by formally inverting bijective weak homotopy equivalences.
