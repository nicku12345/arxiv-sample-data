In this paper we study the relation between the function J_{4_1,0}, which arises from a quantum invariant of the figure eight knot, and Sudler's trigonometric product. We prove the convergence of suitably normalized logarithms of J_{4_1,0} along points coming from continued fraction convergents of a quadratic irrational, and we show that this asymptotics deviates from the universal limiting behavior that has been found by Bettin and Drappeau in the case of large partial quotients. We relate the value of J_{4_1,0} to that of Sudler's trigonometric product, and establish asymptotic upper and lower bounds for such Sudler products in response to a question of Lubinsky.
