Let C(\mathbf I) be the set of all continuous self-maps from {\mathbf I}=[0,1] with the topology of uniformly convergence. A map f\in C({\mathbf I}) is called a transitive map if for every pair of non-empty open sets U,V in \mathbf{I}, there exists a positive integer n such that U\cap f^{-n}(V)\not=\emptyset. We note T(\mathbf{I}) and \overline{T(\mathbf{I})} to be the sets of all transitive maps and its closure in the space C(\mathbf I). In this paper, we show that T(\mathbf{I}) and \overline{T(\mathbf{I})} are homeomorphic to the separable Hilbert space \ell_2.
