A subset of the Cantor cube is null-additive if its algebraic sum with any null set is null. We construct a set of cardinality continuum such that: all continuous images of the set into the Cantor cube are null-additive, it contains a homeomorphic copy of a set that is not null-additive, and it has the property \gamma, a strong combinatorial covering property. We also construct a nontrivial subset of the Cantor cube with the property \gamma that is not null additive. Set-theoretic assumptions used in our constructions are far milder than used earlier by Galvin--Miller and Bartoszy\'nski--Rec{\l}aw, to obtain sets with analogous properties. We also consider products of Sierpi\'nski sets in the context of combinatorial covering properties.
