We construct, in \mathsf{ZFC}, a countably compact subgroup of 2^{\mathfrak{c}} without non-trivial convergent sequences, answering an old problem of van Douwen. As a consequence we also prove the existence of two countably compact groups \mathbb{G}_{0} and \mathbb{G}_{1} such that the product \mathbb{G}_{0} \times \mathbb{G}_{1} is not countably compact, thus answering a classical problem of Comfort.
