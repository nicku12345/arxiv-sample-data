Roitman's combinatorial principle \Delta is equivalent to monotone normality of the nabla product, \nabla (\omega +1)^\omega. If \{ X_n : n\in \omega\} is a family of metrizable spaces and \nabla_n X_n is monotonically normal, then \nabla_n X_n is hereditarily paracompact. Hence, if \Delta holds then the box product \square (\omega +1)^\omega is paracompact. Large fragments of \Delta hold in \mathsf{ZFC}, yielding large subspaces of \nabla (\omega+1)^\omega that are `really' monotonically normal. Countable nabla products of metrizable spaces which are respectively: arbitrary, of size \le \mathfrak{c}, or separable, are monotonically normal under respectively: \mathfrak{b}=\mathfrak{d}, \mathfrak{d}=\mathfrak{c} or the Model Hypothesis.   It is consistent and independent that \nabla A(\omega_1)^\omega and \nabla (\omega_1+1)^\omega are hereditarily normal (or hereditarily paracompact, or monotonically normal). In \mathsf{ZFC} neither \nabla A(\omega_2)^\omega nor \nabla (\omega_2+1)^\omega is hereditarily normal.
