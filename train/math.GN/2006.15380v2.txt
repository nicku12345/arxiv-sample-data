A space X is said to have the set star Hurewicz property if for each nonempty subset A of X and each sequence (\mathcal{U}_n: n \in \mathbb{N}) of sets open in X such that for each n\in \mathbb N, \overline{A} \subset \cup \mathcal{U}_n, there is a sequence (\mathcal{V}_n: n \in \mathbb{N}) such that for each n \in \mathbb{N}, \mathcal{V}_n is a finite subset of \mathcal{U}_n and for each x \in A, x \in {\rm St}(\cup \mathcal{V}_n, \mathcal{U}_n) for all but finitely many n. In this paper, we investigate the relationships among set star Hurewicz, set strongly star Hurewicz and other related covering properties and study the topological properties of these topological spaces.
