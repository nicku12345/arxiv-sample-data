Given a discrete group G, we identify the Stone-\check Cech compactification \beta G with the set of all ultrafilters on G and put G^\ast =\beta G\setminus G. The action G on G by the conjugations (g,x)\mapsto g^{-1}xg induces the action of G on G^\ast by (g, p)\mapsto p^g , p^g = \{ g^{-1} Pg: P\in p\}. We study interplays between the algebraic properties of G and the dynamical properties of (G, G^\ast). In particular, we show that p^G is finite for each p\in G^\ast if and only if the commutant of G is finite.
