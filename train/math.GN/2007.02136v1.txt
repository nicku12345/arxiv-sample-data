We develop tools to recognize sequential spaces with large inductive dimension zero. We show the Hawaiian earring group G is 0 dimensional, when endowed with the quotient topology, inherited from the space of based loops with the compact open topology. In particular G is T_4 and hence inclusion G \rightarrow F_M (G) is a topological embedding into the free topological group F_M (G) in the sense of Markov.
