This paper studies n-player games where players beliefs about their opponents behaviour are capacities (fuzzy measures, non-additive probabilities). The concept of an equilibrium under uncertainty was introduced by J.Dow and S.Werlang (1994) for two players and was extended to n-player games by J.Eichberger and D.Kelsey (2000). Expected utility (payoff function) was expressed by Choquet integral. The concept of an equilibrium under uncertainty with expected utility expressed by Sugeno integral were considered by T.Radul (2018). We consider in this paper an equilibrium with expected utility expressed by fuzzy integral generated by a continuous t-norm which is a natural generalization of Sugeno integral.
