The probabilistic powerdomain \mathbf V X on a space X is the space of all continuous valuations on X. We show that, for every quasi-continuous domain X, \mathbf V X is again a quasi-continuous domain, and that the Scott and weak topologies then agree on \mathbf V X. This also applies to the subspaces of probability and subprobability valuations on X. We also show that the Scott and weak topologies on the \mathbf V X may differ when X is not quasi-continuous, and we give a simple, compact Hausdorff counterexample.
