This article introduces descriptive fixed sets and their properties in descriptive proximity spaces viewed in the context of planar ribbon complexes. These fixed sets are a byproduct of descriptive proximally continuous maps that spawn fixed subsets, eventual fixed subsets and almost fixed subsets of the maps. For descriptive continuous map f on a descriptive proximity space X, a subset A of X is fixed, provided the description of f(A) matches the desription of A. In terms ribbon complexes in a CW space, an Abelian group representation of a ribbon is Day-amenable and each amenable ribbon has a fixed point. A main result in this paper is that if h is a proximal descriptive conjugacy between maps f,g, then if A is an [ordinary, eventual, almost] descriptively fixed subset of f, then h(A) is a descriptively fixed subset of g.
