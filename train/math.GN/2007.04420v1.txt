A locally convex space (lcs) E is said to have an \omega^{\omega}-base if E has a neighborhood base \{U_{\alpha}:\alpha\in\omega^\omega\} at zero such that U_{\beta}\subseteq U_{\alpha} for all \alpha\leq\beta. The class of lcs with an \omega^{\omega}-base is large, among others contains all (LM)-spaces (hence (LF)-spaces), strong duals of distinguished Fr\'echet lcs (hence spaces of distributions D'(\Omega)). A remarkable result of Cascales-Orihuela states that every compact set in a lcs with an \omega^{\omega}-base is metrizable. Our main result shows that every uncountable-dimensional lcs with an \omega^{\omega}-base contains an infinite-dimensional metrizable compact subset. On the other hand, the countable-dimensional space \varphi endowed with the finest locally convex topology has an \omega^\omega-base but contains no infinite-dimensional compact subsets. It turns out that \varphi is a unique infinite-dimensional locally convex space which is a k_{\mathbb{R}}-space containing no infinite-dimensional compact subsets. Applications to spaces C_{p}(X) are provided.
