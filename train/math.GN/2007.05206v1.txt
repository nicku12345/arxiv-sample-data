For a Hausdorff zero-dimensional topological space X and a totally ordered field F with interval topology, let C_c(X,F) be the ring of all F-valued continuous functions on X with countable range. It is proved that if F is either an uncountable field or countable subfield of \mathbb{R}, then the structure space of C_c(X,F) is \beta_0X, the Banaschewski Compactification of X. The ideals \{O^{p,F}_c:p\in \beta_0X\} in C_c(X,F) are introduced as modified countable analogue of the ideals \{O^p:p\in\beta X\} in C(X). It is realized that C_c(X,F)\cap C_K(X,F)=\bigcap_{p\in\beta_0X\texttt{\textbackslash}X} O^{p,F}_c, this may be called a countable analogue of the well-known formula C_K(X)=\bigcap_{p\in\beta X\texttt{\textbackslash}X}O^p in C(X). Furthermore, it is shown that the hypothesis C_c(X,F) is a Von-Neumann regular ring is equivalent to amongst others the condition that X is a P-space.
