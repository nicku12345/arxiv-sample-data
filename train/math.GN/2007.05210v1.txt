c-realcompact spaces are introduced by Karamzadeh and Keshtkar in Quaest. Math. 41(8), 2018, 1135-1167. We offer a characterization of these spaces X via c-stable family of closed sets in X by showing that X is c-realcompact if and only if each c-stable family of closed sets in X with finite intersection property has nonempty intersection. This last condition which makes sense for an arbitrary topological space can be taken as an alternative definition of a c-realcompact space. We show that each topological space can be extended as a dense subspace to a c-realcompact space with some desired extension property. An allied class of spaces viz CP-compact spaces akin to that of c-realcompact spaces are introduced. The paper ends after examining how far a known class of c-realcompact spaces could be realized as CP-compact for appropriately chosen ideal P of closed sets in X.
