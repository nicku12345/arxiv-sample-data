This paper focuses mainly on the bounded Baire one functions. The uniform norm topology arises from the \sup-norm defined on the collection B_1^*(X) of all bounded Baire one functions. With respect to this topology, B_1^*(X) is a topological ring as well as a topological vector space. It is proved that under uniform norm topology, the set of all positive units (respectively, negative units) form an open set and as a consequence of it, every maximal ideal is closed in B_1^*(X). Since the natural extension of uniform norm topology on B_1(X), when B_1^*(X) \neq B_1(X), does not show up these features, a topology called m_B-topology is defined on B_1(X) suitably to achieve these results on B_1(X). It is proved that the relative m_B topology coincides with the uniform norm topology on B_1^*(X) if and only if B_1(X) = B_1^*(X). Moreover, B_1(X) with m_B-topology is 1st countable if and only if B_1(X) = B_1^*(X). The last part of the paper establishes a correspondence between the ideals of B_1^*(X) and a special class of Z_B-filters, called e_B-filters on a normal topological space X. It is also observed that for normal spaces, the cardinality of the collection of all maximal ideals of B_1(X) and those of B_1^*(X) are same.
