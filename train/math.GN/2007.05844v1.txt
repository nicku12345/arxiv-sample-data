Almost disjoint families of true cardinality \mathfrak{c} are used to produce an example of a mildly-normal not partly-normal \Psi-space and a quasi-normal not almost-normal \Psi-space. This is related with a problem posed by Lufti Kalantan where he asks whether there exists a mad family so that the related Mr\'owka-Isbell space is partly-normal. In addition, a consistent example of a Luzin mad family such that its associated \Psi-space is quasi-normal is provided.
