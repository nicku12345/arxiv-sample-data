For any composant E \subset \mathbb H^* and corresponding near-coherence class \mathscr E \subset \omega^* we prove the following are equivalent : (1) E properly contains a dense semicontinuum. (2) Each countable subset of E is contained in a dense proper semicontinuum of E. (3) Each countable subset of E is disjoint from some dense proper semicontinuum of E. (4) \mathscr E  has a minimal element in the finite-to-one monotone order of ultrafilters. (5) \mathscr E  has a Q-point. A consequence is that NCF is equivalent to \mathbb H^* containing no proper dense semicontinuum and no non-block points. This gives an axiom-contingent answer to a question of the author. Thus every known continuum has either a proper dense semicontinuum at every point or at no points. We examine the structure of indecomposable continua for which this fails, and deduce they contain a maximum semicontinuum with dense interior.
