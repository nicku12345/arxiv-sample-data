We prove the three propositions are equivalent: (a) Every Hausdorff continuum has two or more shore points. (b) Every Hausdorff continuum has two or more non-block points. (c) Every Hausdorff continuum is coastal at each point. Thus it is consistent that all three properties fail. We also give the following characterisation of shore points: The point p of the continuum X is a shore point if and only if there is a net of subcontinua in \{K \in C(X): K \subset \kappa(p) - p\} tending to X in the Vietoris topology. This contrasts with the standard characterisation which only demands the net elements be contained in X-p. In addition we prove every point of an indecomposable continuum is a shore point.
