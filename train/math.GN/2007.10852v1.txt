In this paper, we introduce the notion of topologically Banach contraction mapping defined on an arbitrary topological space X with the help of a continuous function g:X\times X\rightarrow \mathbb{R} and investigate the existence of fixed points of such mapping. Moreover, we introduce two types of mappings defined on a non-empty subset of X and produce sufficient conditions which will ensure the existence of best proximity points for these mappings. Our best proximity point results also extend some existing results from metric spaces or Banach spaces to topological spaces. More precisely, our newly introduced mappings are more general than that of the corresponding notions introduced by Bunlue and Suantai [Arch. Math. (Brno), 54(2018), 165-176]. We present several examples to validate our results and justify its motivation. To study best proximity point results, we introduce the notions of g-closed, g-sequentially compact subsets of X and produce examples to show that there exists a non-empty subset of X which is not closed, sequentially compact under usual topology but is g-closed and g-sequentially compact.
