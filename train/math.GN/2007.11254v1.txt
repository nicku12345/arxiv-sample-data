Given a topological group G that can be embedded as a topological subgroup into some topological vector space (over the field of reals) we say that G has invariant linear span if all linear spans of G under arbitrary embeddings into topological vector spaces are isomorphic as topological vector spaces.   For an arbitrary set A let \mathbb{Z}^{(A)} be the direct sum of |A|-many copies of the discrete group of integers endowed with the Tychonoff product topology. We show that the topological group \mathbb{Z}^{(A)} has invariant linear span. This answers a question of D. Dikranjan et al. in positive.   We prove that given a non-discrete sequential space X, the free abelian topological group A(X) over X is an example of a topological group that embeds into a topological vector space but does not have invariant linear span.
