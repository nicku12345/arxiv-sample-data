We call a regular topological space X to be \mathbb R-rigid if any continuous real-valued function on X is constant. In this paper we construct a number of consistent examples of countably compact \mathbb R-rigid spaces with additional properties like separability and first countability. This way we answer several questions of Tzannes, Banakh, Ravsky, and the first author, as well as get a consistent \mathbb R-rigid counterexample to a classical problem of Nyikos.
