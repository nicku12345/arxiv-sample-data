A quasi-continuous dynamical system is a pair (X,f) consisting of a topological space X and a mapping f: X\to X such that f^n is quasi-continuous for all n \in \mathbb N, where \mathbb N is the set of non-negative integers. In this paper, we show that under appropriate assumptions, various definitions of the concept of topological transitivity are equivalent in a quasi-continuous dynamical system. Our main results establish the equivalence of topological and point transitivity in a quasi-continuous dynamical system. These extend some classical results on continuous dynamical systems in [3], [10] and [25], and some results on quasi-continuous dynamical systems in [7] and [8].
