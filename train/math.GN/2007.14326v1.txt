In this survey we catalogue the many results of the past several decades concerning bounds on the cardinality of a topological space with homogeneous or homogeneous-like properties. These results include van Douwen's Theorem, which states |X|\leq 2^{\pi w(X)} if X is a power homogeneous Hausdorff space, and its improvements |X|\leq d(X)^{\pi\chi(X)} and |X|\leq 2^{c(X)\pi\chi(X)} for spaces X with the same properties. We also discuss de la Vega's Theorem, which states that |X|\leq 2^{t(X)} if X is a homogeneous compactum, as well as its recent improvements and generalizations to other settings. This reference document also includes a table of strongest known cardinality bounds on spaces with homogeneous-like properties. The author has chosen to give some proofs if they exhibit typical or fundamental proof techniques. Finally, a few new results are given, notably (1) |X|\leq d(X)^{\pi n\chi(X)} if X is homogeneous and Hausdorff, and (2) |X|\leq \pi\chi(X)^{c(X)q\psi(X)} if X is a regular homogeneous space. The invariant \pi n\chi(X), defined in this paper, has the property \pi n\chi(X)\leq\pi\chi(X) and thus (1) improves the bound d(X)^{\pi\chi(X)} for homogeneous Hausdorff spaces. The invariant q\psi(X) has the properties q\psi(X)\leq\pi\chi(X) and q\psi(X)\leq\psi_c(X) if X is Hausdorff, thus (2) improves the bound 2^{c(X)\pi\chi(X)} in the regular, homogeneous setting.
