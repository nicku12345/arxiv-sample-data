In the absence of the axiom of choice, the set-theoretic status of many natural statements about metrizable compact spaces is investigated. Some of the statements are provable in \mathbf{ZF}, some are shown to be independent of \mathbf{ZF}. For independence results, distinct models of \mathbf{ZF} and permutation models of \mathbf{ZFA} with transfer theorems of Pincus are applied. New symmetric models are constructed in each of which the power set of \mathbb{R} is well-orderable, the Continuum Hypothesis is satisfied but a denumerable family of non-empty finite sets can fail to have a choice function, and a compact metrizable space need not be embeddable into the Tychonoff cube [0, 1]^{\mathbb{R}}.
