We characterize the uniform convergence points set of a pointwisely convergent sequence of real-valued functions defined on a perfectly normal space. We prove that if X is a perfectly normal space which can be covered by a disjoint sequence of dense subsets and A\subseteq X, then A is the set of points of the uniform convergence for some convergent sequence (f_n)_{n\in\omega} of functions f_n:X\to \mathbb R if and only if A is G_\delta-set which contains all isolated points of X. This result generalizes a theorem of J\'{a}n Bors\'{i}k published in 2019.
