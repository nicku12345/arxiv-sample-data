In the paper, we investigate (scattered) compact spaces with a P-base for some poset P. More specifically, we prove that any compact space with an \omega^\omega-base is metrizable and any scattered compact space with an \omega^\omega-base is countable under the assumption \omega_1<\mathfrak{b}. These give positive solutions to Problems 8.6.9 and 8.7.7 in \cite{Banakh2019}. Using forcing, we also prove that in a model of \omega_1<\mathfrak{b}, there is a non-first-countable compact space with a P-base for some poset P with calibre~\omega_1.
