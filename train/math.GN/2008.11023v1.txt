We investigate some versions of d-space, well-filtered space and Rudin space concerning various countability properties. The main results include: (i) if the sobrification of a T_0 space X is first-countable, then X is an \omega-Rudin space; (ii) every \omega-well-filtered space is sober if its sobrification is first-countable; (iii) if a T_0 space is second-countable or first-countable and with a countable underlying set, then it is a \omega-Rudin space; (iv) every first-countable T_0 space is well-filtered determined; (v) every irreducible closed subset in a first-countable \omega-well-filtered space is countably-directed; (vi) every first-countable \omega-well-filtered \omega^\ast-d-space is sober.
