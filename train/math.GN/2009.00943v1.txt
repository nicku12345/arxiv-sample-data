A generalization of the triangle inequality is introduced by a mapping similar to a t-conorm mapping. This generalization leads us to a notion for which we use the \star-metric terminology. We are interested in the topological space induced by a \star-metric. Considering some examples of non-trivial \star-metrizable topological spaces, we also study the product topology for a finite family of \star-metrizable topological spaces.
