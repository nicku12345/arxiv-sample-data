Mathematicians like Markov and Bishop made an effort to develop constructive mathematics and extended many theorems in classical mathematical analysis. Heine Borel theorem tells us that a closed bounded subset of Euclidean space R is compact, but in constructive mathematics, Tseitin and Zaslavskii showed that the set of all constructive real numbers between 0 and 1 is not compact. We are going to show that when giving certain restriction to the open cover on [0,1], we can however always choose a finite sub-cover.
