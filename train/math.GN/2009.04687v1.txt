We give a complete description of the structure of the connected components of the general linear group of a real hereditarily indecomposable Banach space, depending on the existence of complex structures on the space itself and on its hyperplanes. A side result is the fact that complex structures cannot exist simultaneously on such a space and on its hyperplanes.
