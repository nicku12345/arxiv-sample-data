We prove that an almost zero-dimensional space X is an Erd\H{o}s space factor if and only if X has a Sierpi\'{n}ski stratification of C-sets. We apply this characterization to spaces which are countable unions of C-set Erd\H{o}s space factors. We show that the Erd\H{o}s space \mathfrak E is unstable by giving strongly \sigma-complete and nowhere \sigma-complete examples of almost zero-dimensional F_{\sigma\delta}-spaces which are not Erd\H{o}s space factors. This answers a question by Dijkstra and van Mill.
