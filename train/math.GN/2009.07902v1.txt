We deeply study retractions associated to suitable models in compact spaces admitting a retractional skeleton and find several interesting consequences. Most importantly, we provide a new characterization of Valdivia compacta using the notion of retractional skeletons, which seems to be helpful when characterizing its subclasses. This characterization of Valdivia compacta allowed us to characterize Eberlein and semi-Eberlein compacta in terms of retractional skeletons.
