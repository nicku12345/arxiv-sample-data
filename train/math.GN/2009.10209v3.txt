We explore almost-normality in Isbell-Mr\'owka spaces and some related concepts. We use forcing to provide an example of an almost-normal not normal almost disjoint family, explore the concept of semi-normality in Isbell-Mr\'owka spaces, define the concept of strongly (\aleph_0, <\mathfrak c)-separated almost disjoint families and prove the generic existence of completely separable strongly (\aleph_0, <\mathfrak c)-almost disjoint families assuming \mathfrak s=\mathfrak c and \mathfrak b=\mathfrak c. We also provide an example of a Tychonoff almost-normal not normal pseudocompact space which is not countably compact, answering a question from P. Szeptycki and S. Garcia-Balan.
