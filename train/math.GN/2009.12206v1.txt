Labyrinth fractals are self-similar fractals that were introduced and studied in recent work by Cristea and Steinsky. In the present paper we define and study more general objects, called mixed labyrinth fractals, that are in general not self-similar and are constructed by using sequences of labyrinth patterns. We show that mixed labyrinth fractals are dendrites and study properties of the paths in the graphs associated to prefractals, and of arcs in the fractal, e.g., the path length and the box counting dimension and length of arcs. We also consider more general objects related to mixed labyrinth fractals, formulate two conjectures about arc lengths, and establish connections to recent results on generalised Sierpinski carpets.
