In [G. Dimov and E. Ivanova-Dimova, Two extensions of the Stone Duality to the category of zero-dimensional Hausdorff spaces, arXiv:1901.04537v4, 1--33], extending the Stone Duality Theorem, we proved two duality theorems for the category ZDHaus of zero-dimensional Hausdorff spaces and continuous maps. Now we derive from them the extension of the Stone Duality Theorem to the category BooleSp of zero-dimensional locally compact Hausdorff spaces and continuous maps obtained in [G. Dimov, Some generalizations of the Stone Duality Theorem, Publicationes Mathematicae Debrecen, 80 (2012), 255--293], as well as two new duality theorems for the category BooleSp.
