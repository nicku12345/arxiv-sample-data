We show that if f\colon I\to I is piecewise monotone, post-critically finite, and locally eventually onto, then for every point x\in X=\underleftarrow{\lim}(I,f) there exists a planar embedding of X such that x is accessible. In particular, every point x in Minc's continuum X_M from [Question 19 p. 335 in Continuum theory : proceedings of the special session in honor of Professor Sam B. Nadler, Jr.'s 60th birthday, Lecture notes in pure and applied mathematics; v. 230, New York: Marcel Dekker.] can be embedded accessibly. All constructed embeddings are thin, i.e. can be covered by an arbitrary small chain of open sets which are connected in the plane.
