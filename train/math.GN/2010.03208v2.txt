We study topological groups having all closed subgroups (totally) minimal and we call such groups c-(totally) minimal. We show that a locally compact c-minimal connected group is compact. Using a well-known theorem of Hall and Kulatilaka and a characterization of a certain class of Lie groups, due to Grosser and Herfort, we prove that a c-minimal locally solvable Lie group is compact. It is shown that if a topological group G contains a compact open normal subgroup N, then G is c-totally minimal if and only if G/N is hereditarily non-topologizable. Moreover, a c-totally minimal group that is either complete solvable or strongly compactly covered must be compact.
