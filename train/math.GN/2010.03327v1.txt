We consider a real-valued function f defined on the set of infinite branches X of a countably branching pruned tree T. The function f is said to be a \textit{limsup function} if there is a function u \colon T \to \mathbb{R} such that f(x) = \limsup_{t \to \infty} u(x_{0},\dots,x_{t}) for each x \in X. We study a game characterization of limsup functions, as well as a novel game characterization of functions of Baire class 1.
