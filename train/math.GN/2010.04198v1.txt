In this paper, we consider inverse limits of [0,1] using upper semicontinuous set-valued functions. We introduce two generalizations of the Intermediate Value Property and prove that inverse limits with upper semicontinuous set-valued bonding functions are connected if the bonding functions are surjective, have connected graphs, and have either generalization of the Intermediate Value Property. Examples are given to demonstrate that if any of the conditions is dropped, the result does not hold in general. An example is given to show that an inverse limit may be connected even if the bonding functions do not have either Intermediate Value Property. Further, we compare the structures of set-valued functions with the two types of the Intermediate Value Property.
