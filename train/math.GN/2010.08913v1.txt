In this paper we study prime spectra of commutative BCK-algebras. We give a new construction for commutative BCK-algebras using rooted trees, and determine both the ideal lattice and prime ideal lattice of such algebras. We prove that the spectrum of any commutative BCK-algebra is a locally compact generalized spectral space which is compact if and only if the algebra is finitely generated as an ideal. Further, we show that if a commutative BCK-algebra is involutory, then its spectrum is a Priestley space. Finally, we consider the functorial properties of the spectrum and define a functor from the category of commutative BCK-algebras to the category of distributive lattices with zero. We give a partial answer to the question: what distributive lattices lie in the image of this functor?
