In this paper, we define asymptotic dimension of fuzzy metric spaces in the sense of George and Veeramini. We prove that asymptotic dimension is an invariant in the coarse category of fuzzy metric spaces. We also show several consequences of asymptotic dimension in the fuzzy setting which resemble the consequences of asymptotic dimension in the metric setting. We finish with calculating asymptotic dimension of a few fuzzy metric spaces.
