Let T\subset\mathbb{R} and (X,\mathcal{U}) be a uniform space with an at most countable gage of pseudometrics \{d_p:p\in\mathcal{P}\} of the uniformity \mathcal{U}. Given f\in X^T (=the family of all functions from T into X), the approximate variation of f is the two-parameter family \{V_{\varepsilon,p}(f):\varepsilon>0,p\in\mathcal{P}\}, where V_{\varepsilon,p}(f) is the greatest lower bound of Jordan's variations V_p(g) on T with respect to d_p of all functions g\in X^T such that d_p(f(t),g(t))\le\varepsilon for all t\in T. We establish the following pointwise selection principle: If a pointwise relatively sequentially compact sequence of functions \{f_j\}_{j=1}^\infty\subset X^T is such that \limsup_{j\to\infty}V_{\varepsilon,p}(f_j)<\infty for all \varepsilon>0 and p\in\mathcal{P}, then it contains a subsequence which converges pointwise on T to a bounded regulated function f\in X^T. We illustrate this result by appropriate examples, and present a characterization of regulated functions f\in X^T in terms of the approximate variation.
