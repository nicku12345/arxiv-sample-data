We show that the escaping set for f(z)=\exp(z)-1 is nowhere \sigma-complete. This establishes that the escaping endpoint set \dot E(f) is a first category almost zero-dimensional space which is F_{\sigma\delta} and nowhere G_{\delta \sigma}. Only two other elementary spaces with those properties are known: \mathbb Q ^\omega and Erd\H{o}s space \mathfrak E. Previous work has shown that \dot E(f) is homeomorphic to neither of those.
