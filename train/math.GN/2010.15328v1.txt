Maps f,g\colon I\to I are called strongly commuting if f\circ g^{-1}=g^{-1}\circ f. We show that strongly commuting, piecewise monotone maps f,g can be decomposed into a finite number of invariant intervals (or period 2 intervals) on which f,g are either both open maps, or at least one of them is monotone. As a consequence, we show that strongly commuting piecewise monotone interval maps have a common fixed point. Results of the paper also have implications in understanding dynamical properties of certain maps on inverse limit spaces.
