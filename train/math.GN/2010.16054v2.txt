Let \mathcal{I},\mathcal{J} be two ideals on \mathbf{N} which contain the family \mathrm{Fin} of finite sets. We provide necessary and sufficient conditions on the entries of an infinite real matrix A=(a_{n,k}) which maps \mathcal{I}-convergent bounded sequences into \mathcal{J}-convergent bounded sequences and preserves the corresponding ideal limits. The well-known characterization of regular matrices due to Silverman--Toeplitz corresponds to the case \mathcal{I}=\mathcal{J}=\mathrm{Fin}.   Lastly, we provide some applications to permutation and diagonal matrices, which extend several known results in the literature.
