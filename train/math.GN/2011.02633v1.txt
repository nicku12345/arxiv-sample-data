Separability is one of the most basic and important topological properties. In this paper, the separability in (strongly) topological gyrogroups is studied. It is proved that every first-countable left {\omega}-narrow strongly topological gyrogroup is separable. Furthermore, it is shown that if a feathered strongly topological gyrogroup G is isomorphic to a subgyrogroup of a separable strongly topological gyrogroup, then G is separable. Therefore, if a metrizable strongly topological gyrogroup G is isomorphic to a subgyrogroup of a separable strongly topological gyrogroup, then G is separable, and if a locally compact strongly topological gyrogroup G is isomorphic to a subgyrogroup of a separable strongly topological gyrogroup, then G is separable.
