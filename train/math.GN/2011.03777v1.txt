We consider ideals on \omega\times\omega generated by subsets of \omega^\omega. Namely, for \mathcal{F}\subset \omega^\omega we define \mathcal{I}(\mathcal{F})=\{A\subset \omega\times\omega:\exists f\in \mathcal{F}\,\forall^\infty n\in\omega\, (|\{k:(n,k)\in A\}|\leq f(n))\}. These ideals encompass other well known ideals e.g.~fin\times fin and ED. We examine some properties of these ideals including topological complexity and cardinal characteristics associated with them.
