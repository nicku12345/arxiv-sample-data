In this note, we continue the investigation of the new version of characterized subgroups of the circle group \mathbb{T}, namely, "statistically characterized subgroups" (shortly, "s-characterized subgroups") recently introduced in \cite{DDB}. We primarily investigate these subgroups for sequences arising out of continued fraction representation of irrational numbers \alpha in line of \cite{L} and \cite{KL} (followed by \cite{BDMW1}) comparing their main results for this new notion and show that these subgroups are strictly larger in size (so nontrivial) than the corresponding characterized subgroups, having cardinality \mathfrak{c} and containing the subgroup \langle \alpha \rangle and in the process answer the Open Question 6.4 posed in \cite{DDB}.
