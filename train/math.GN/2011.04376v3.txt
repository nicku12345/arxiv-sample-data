Todorcevi\'{c}' trichotomy in the class of separable Rosenthal compacta induces a hierarchy in the class of tame (compact, metrizable) dynamical systems (X,T) according to the topological properties of their enveloping semigroups E(X). More precisely, we define the classes \mathrm{Tame}_\mathbf{2} \subset \mathrm{Tame}_\mathbf{1} \subset \mathrm{Tame}, where \mathrm{Tame}_\mathbf{1} is the proper subclass of tame systems with first countable E(X), and \mathrm{Tame}_\mathbf{2} is its proper subclass consisting of systems with hereditarily separable E(X). We study some general properties of these classes and exhibit many examples to illustrate these properties.
