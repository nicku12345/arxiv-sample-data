Let WS(X, d) be the class of ultrametric spaces which are weakly similar to ultrametric space (X, d). The main results of the paper completely describe the ultrametric spaces (X, d) for which the equality  \rho(x, y) = f(d(\Phi(x), \Phi(y)))  holds for every (Y, \rho) \in WS(X, d), every weak similarity \Phi \colon Y \to X, and all x, y \in Y with some ultrametric (pseudoultrametric) preserving function f depending on \Phi.
