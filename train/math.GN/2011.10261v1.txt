We call a pair of infinite cardinals (\kappa,\lambda) with \kappa > \lambda a dominating (resp. pinning down) pair for a topological space X if for every subset A of X (resp. family \mathcal{U} of non-empty open sets in X) of cardinality \le \kappa there is B \subset X of cardinality \le \lambda such that A \subset \overline{B} (resp. B \cap U \ne \emptyset for each U \in \mathcal{U}). Clearly, a dominating pair is also a pinning down pair for X. Our definitions generalize the concepts introduced in [GTW] resp. [BT] which focused on pairs of the form (2^\lambda,\lambda).   The main aim of this paper is to answer a large number of the numerous problems from [GTW] and [BT] that asked if certain conditions on a space X together with the assumption that (2^\lambda,\lambda) or ((2^\lambda)^+,\lambda) is a pinning down pair or \dominating pair for X would imply d(X) \le \lambda.
