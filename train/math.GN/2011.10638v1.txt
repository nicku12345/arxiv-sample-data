Let \mathscr{X} be the set of positive real sequences x=(x_n) such that the series \sum_n x_n is divergent. For each x \in \mathscr{X}, let \mathcal{I}_x be the collection of all A\subseteq \mathbf{N} such that the subseries \sum_{n \in A}x_n is convergent. Moreover, let \mathscr{A} be the set of sequences x \in \mathscr{X} such that \lim_n x_n=0 and \mathcal{I}_x\neq \mathcal{I}_y for all sequences y=(y_n) \in \mathscr{X} with \liminf_n y_{n+1}/y_n>0. We show that \mathscr{A} is comeager and that contains uncountably many sequences x which generate pairwise nonisomorphic ideals \mathcal{I}_x. This answers, in particular, an open question recently posed by M. Filipczak and G. Horbaczewska.
