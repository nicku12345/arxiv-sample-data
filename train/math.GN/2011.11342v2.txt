Using a game-theoretic approach we present a generalization of the classical result of Brzuchowski, Cicho\'n, Grzegorek and Ryll-Nardzewski on non-measurable unions. We also present applications of obtained results to Marczewski--Burstin representable ideals, as well as to establishing some countability and continuity properties of measurable functions and homomorphisms between topological groups.
