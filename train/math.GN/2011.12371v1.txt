We consider, for a finite graph G, when the surjective map \mathrm{Conf}_{n+1}(G) \rightarrow \mathrm{Conf}_n(G) of configuration spaces admits a section. We study when the answer depends only on the homotopy type of G, and give a complete answer. We also provide basic techniques for construction of sections and show that the induced map on fundamental groups is always surjective.
