In this paper we will introduce and develop a theory of adjunction spaces which allows the construction of non-Hausdorff topological manifolds from standard Hausdorff ones. This is done by adjoining Hausdorff manifolds along homeomorphic open submanifolds, but leaving the boundaries of these subspaces unidentified. It is shown that all non-Hausdorff manifolds may be constructed in this manner. We also provide a partial characterisation of the maximal Hausdorff submanifolds of a given non-Hausdorff manifold.
