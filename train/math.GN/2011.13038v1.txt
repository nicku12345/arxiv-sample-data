We investigate the Tukey order in the class of F_\sigma ideals of subsets of \omega. We show that no nontrivial F_\sigma ideal is Tukey below a G_\delta \sigma-ideal of compact sets. We introduce the notions of flat ideals and gradually flat ideals. We prove a dichotomy theorem for flat ideals isolating gradual flatness as the side of the dichotomy that is structurally good. We give diverse characterizations of gradual flatness among flat ideals using Tukey reductions and games. For example, we show that all gradually flat ideals are Tukey below the density zero ideal \mathcal Z_0.
