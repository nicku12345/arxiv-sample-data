Let j:Y \to X be a continuous surjection of compact metric spaces. Whyburn proved that j is irreducible, meaning that j(F) \subsetneq X for any proper closed subset F \subsetneq Y, if and only if j is almost one-to-one, in the sense that \[   \overline{\{y \in Y: j^{-1}(j(y)) = y\}} = Y. \] In this note we prove the following generalization: There exists a unique minimal closed set K \subseteq Y such that j(K) = X if and only if \[   \overline{\{x \in X: card(j^{-1}(x)) = 1\}} = X. \] Translated to the language of operator algebras, this says that if A \subseteq B is a unital inclusion of separable abelian C^*-algebras, then there exists a unique pseudo-expectation (in the sense of Pitts) if and only if the almost extension property of Nagy-Reznikoff holds. More generally, we prove that a unital inclusion of (not necessarily separable) abelian C^*-algebras has a unique pseudo-expectation if and only if it is aperiodic (in the sense of Kwa\'{s}niewski-Meyer).
