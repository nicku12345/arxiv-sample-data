We show that the existence of a dense set of periodic points for a topologically transitive non-minimal continuous group action on a Hausdorff uniform space with an infinite acting group does not necessarily imply a sensitive dependence to the initial conditions in such a system. This leads to define the chaos in the sense of Devaney for a continuous group action on a Hausdorff uniform spaces with an infinite acting group in the original way, i.e. a non-minimal topologically transitive and sensitive system with a dense set of periodic points is a chaotic system in the sense of Devaney.
