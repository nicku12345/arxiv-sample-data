We prove that the locally convex space C_{p}(X) of continuous real-valued functions on a Tychonoff space X equipped with the topology of pointwise convergence is distinguished if and only if X is a \Delta-space in the sense of \cite {Knight}. As an application of this characterization theorem we obtain the following results: 1) If X is a \v{C}ech-complete (in particular, compact) space such that C_p(X) is distinguished, then X is scattered. 2) For every separable compact space of the Isbell--Mr\'owka type X, the space C_p(X) is distinguished. 3) If X is the compact space of ordinals [0,\omega_1], then C_p(X) is not distinguished. We observe that the existence of an uncountable separable metrizable space X such that C_p(X) is distinguished, is independent of ZFC. We explore also the question to which extent the class of \Delta-spaces is invariant under basic topological operations.
