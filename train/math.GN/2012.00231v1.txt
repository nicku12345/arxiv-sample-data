We investigate to what extend the density of Z_n-maps in the characterization of Q-manifolds, and the density of maps f\in C(\mathbb N\times Q,X) having discrete images in the l_2-manifolds characterization can be weakened to the density of homological Z_n-maps and homological Z-maps, respectively. As a result, we obtain homological characterizations of Q-manifolds and l_2-manifolds.
