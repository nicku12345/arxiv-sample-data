In this paper, we introduce the concept of \Delta-convexity in an abstract economy with all choice sets being general topological spaces. We give a new generalization of the classical Yannelis-Prabhakar equilibrium existence theorem in abstract economies by relaxing SS-convexity to \Delta-convexity.
