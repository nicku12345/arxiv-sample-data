It is well known that for a Hausdorff topological group X, the limits of convergent sequences in X define a function denoted by \lim from the set of all convergent sequences in X to X. This notion has been modified by Connor and Grosse-Erdmann for real functions by replacing \lim with an arbitrary linear functional G defined on a linear subspace of the vector space of all real sequences. Recently some authors have extended the concept to the topological group setting and introduced the concepts of G-continuity, G-compactness and G-connectedness. In this paper we prove some results on different types of G-compactness for topological group with operations which include topological groups, topological rings without identity, R-modules, Lie algebras, Jordan algebras, and many others.
