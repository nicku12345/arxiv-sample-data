In this paper we give sufficient conditions under which a subsemigroup of a topological group is a subgroup, adding to the results given in \cite{Kosh, can, axioms, forum, Hof, cc, locally} where conditions exist (such as locally compactness, compactness, feeble compactness and sequential compactness) for a semigroup to be a group. In our work we proved that closed precompact subsemigroups of topological groups are semigroups, just like open pseudocompact monoids of topological groups.
