In this paper, we obtain some results on the relationships between different ideal \linebreak convergence modes namely, \mathcal{I}^\mathcal{K}, \mathcal{I}^{\mathcal{K}^*}, \mathcal{I}, \mathcal{K}, \mathcal{I} \cup \mathcal{K} and (\mathcal{I} \cup \mathcal{K})^*. We introduce a topological space namely \mathcal{I}^\mathcal{K}-sequential space and show that the class of \mathcal{I}^\mathcal{K}-sequential spaces contain the sequential spaces. Further \mathcal{I}^\mathcal{K}-notions of cluster points and limit points of a function are also introduced here. For a given sequence in a topological space X, we characterize the set of \mathcal{I}^\mathcal{K}-cluster points of the sequence as closed subsets of X.
