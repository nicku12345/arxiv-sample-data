We study geometric and topological properties of singularities on the boundaries of \varepsilon-neighbourhoods E_\varepsilon = \{x \in \mathbb{R}^2 : \textrm{dist}(x, E) \leq \varepsilon \} of planar sets E \subset \mathbb{R}^2. We develop a novel technique for analysing the boundary and obtain, for a compact set E and \varepsilon > 0, a classification of singularities (i.e. non-smooth points) on \partial E_\varepsilon into eight categories. We also show that the set of singularities is either countable or the disjoint union of a countable set and a closed, totally disconnected, nowhere dense set.
