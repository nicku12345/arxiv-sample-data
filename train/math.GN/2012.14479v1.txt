Given a T_0 paratopological group G and a class \mathcal C of continuous homomorphisms of paratopological groups, we define the \mathcal C-semicompletion \mathcal C[G) and \mathcal C-completion \mathcal C[G] of the group G that contain G as a dense subgroup, satisfy the T_0-separation axiom and have certain universality properties. For special classes \mathcal C, we present some necessary and sufficient conditions on G in order that the (semi)completions \mathcal C[G) and \mathcal C[G] be Hausdorff. Also, we give an example of a Hausdorff paratopological abelian group G whose \mathcal C-semicompletion \mathcal C[G) fails to be a T_1-space, where \mathcal C is the class of continuous homomorphisms of sequentially compact topological groups to paratopological groups. In particular, the group G contains an \omega-bounded sequentially compact subgroup H such that H is a topological group but its closure in G fails to be a subgroup.
