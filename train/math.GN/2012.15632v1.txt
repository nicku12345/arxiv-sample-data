Using the classical technique of condensation of singularities, we prove that, for every zero-dimensional, complete separable metric space G, there exists a Suslinian, chainable metric continuum whose set of end points is homeomorphic to G. This answers a question posed by R. Adikari and W. Lewis in [Houston J. Math. 45 (2019), no. 2, pp. 609--624].
