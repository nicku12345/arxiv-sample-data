Consider a Duffin and Schaeffer continuous frame indexed by the measure space (X,\Sigma,\mu) and with values in \mathbb{F}^n (where \mathbb{F}=\mathbb{R} or \mathbb{F}=\mathbb{C}). By transposition, it is equivalent to an independent n-frame in L^2(X,\mu;\mathbb{F}) in the geometric sense. In general, independent n-frames in a Hilbert space H form the Stiefel manifold St(n,H). In this article, we prove two topological results about St(n,H): first, that St(n,H) \cap S is dense in S when S \subseteq H^n is connected by polynomial paths of finite degree to some \Theta \in St(n,H) \cap S, and second, that the intersection of translates of St(n,H) is path-connected under a condition on the codimension of the span of the components of the translating n-tuples. These translate to statements about \mathcal{F}_{(X,\mu),n}^\mathbb{F} because there is an isometry \mathcal{F}_{(X,\mu),n}^\mathbb{F} \simeq St(n,L^2(X,\mu,\mathbb{F})). We also give special examples of subsets S \subseteq L^2(X,\mu;\mathbb{F}^n) to which the density result applies and that are constructed from the inverse image of singletons by some familiar linear and pseudo-quadratic functions.
