We initiate a systematic investigation of group actions on compact medain algebras via the corresponding dynamics on their spaces of measures. We show that a probability measure which is invariant under a natural push forward operation must be a uniform measure on a cube and use this to show that every amenable group action on a locally convex compact median algebra fixed a sub-cube.
