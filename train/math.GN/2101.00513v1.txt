For given Boolean algebras \mathbb{A} and \mathbb{B} we endow the space \mathcal{H}(\mathbb{A},\mathbb{B}) of all Boolean homomorphisms from \mathbb{A} to \mathbb{B} with various topologies and study convergence properties of sequences in \mathcal{H}(\mathbb{A},\mathbb{B}). We are in particular interested in the situation when \mathbb{B} is a measure algebra as in this case we obtain a natural tool for studying topological convergence properties of sequences of ultrafilters on \mathbb{A} in random extensions of the set-theoretical universe. This appears to have strong connections with Dow and Fremlin's result stating that there are Efimov spaces in the random model. We also investigate relations between topologies on \mathcal{H}(\mathbb{A},\mathbb{B}) for a Boolean algebra \mathbb{B} carrying a strictly positive measure and convergence properties of sequences of measures on \mathbb{A}.
