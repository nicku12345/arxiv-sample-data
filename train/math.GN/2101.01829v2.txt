We consider weakenings of normality in \Psi-spaces and prove that the existence of a MAD family whose \Psi-space is almost-normal is independent of \textsf{ZFC}. We also construct a partly-normal not quasi-normal AD family, answering questions from Garc\'ia-Balan and Szeptycki. We finish by showing that the concepts of almost-normal and strongly \aleph_0-separated AD families are different, even under \textsf{CH}, answering a question from Oliveira-Rodrigues and Santos-Ronchim
