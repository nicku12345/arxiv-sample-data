It is known that if f\colon {\mathbb R}^2 \to {\mathbb R} is a polynomial in each variable, then f is a polynomial. We present generalizations of this fact, when {\mathbb R}^2 is replaced by G\times H, where G and H are topological Abelian groups. We show, e.g., that the conclusion holds (with generalized polynomials in place of polynomials) if G is a connected Baire space and H has a dense subgroup of finite rank or, for continuous functions, if G and H are connected Baire spaces. The condition of continuity can be omitted if G and H are locally compact or complete metric spaces. We present several examples showing that the results are not far from being optimal.
