This work demonstrates the application of OpenCV towards feature extraction from 2D engineering drawings. The extracted features are used in the reconstruction of 3D CAD models in SCAD format and generation of 3D point cloud data that is equivalent to LIDAR scan data. Several legacy designs in mechanical and aerospace engineering are available as engineering drawings rather than software generated CAD models. Even in civil engineering, many of the earlier plans are available as drawings rather than BIM/CAD models. The methods proposed in this work can help convert such drawings easily into 3D CAD and BIM models using camera capture or scanned drawing data. The method demonstrates the applicability for simple shapes and does not yet account for the presence of hidden lines in CAD drawings. The developed codes are made available as python Jupyter notebooks through Github.
