The Golomb (resp. Kirch) topology on the set \mathbb Z^\bullet of nonzero integers is generated by the base consisting of arithmetic progressions a+b\mathbb Z=\{a+bn:n\in\mathbb Z\} where a\in\mathbb Z^\bullet and b is a (square-free) number, coprime with a. In 2019 Dario Spirito proved that the space of nonzero integers endowed with the Golomb topology admits only two self-homeomorphisms. In this paper we prove an analogous fact for the space of nonzero integers endowed with the Kirch topology: it also admits exactly two self-homeomorphisms.
