We show that for a partial action \eta with closed domain of a compact group G on a profinite space X the space of orbits X/\!\sim_G is profinite, this leads to the fact that when G is profinite then the enveloping space X_G is also profinite. Moreover, we provide conditions for the induced quotient map \pi_G: X\to X/\!\sim_G of \eta to have a continuous section. To prove this result we use enveloping actions to construct partial actions of quotient groups on orbit spaces. Relations with continuous sections of the quotient map induced by the enveloping action of \eta are also considered. At the end of this work we treat with Exel's semigroup and the action groupoid, in particular we give conditions for them to be profinite spaces.
