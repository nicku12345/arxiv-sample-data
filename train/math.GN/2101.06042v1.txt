In this paper, firstly, we introduce the concept of convexity in A-metric spaces and show that Mann iteration process converges to the unique fixed point of Zamfirescu type contractions in this newly defined convex A-metric space. Secondly, we define the concept of stability in convex A-metric spaces and establish stability result for the Mann iteration process considered in such spaces. Our results carry some well-known results from the literature to convex A-metric spaces.
