Descriptive set theory can be used to prove new results in classical complex analysis. Let \mathcal{A}(\Omega) be the set of complex analytic functions on an open subset \Omega \subseteq \mathbb{C} endowed with the usual topology of uniform convergence on compact subsets. \mathcal{A}(\Omega) is a Polish ring with the operations of point-wise addition and point-wise multiplication. Inspired by Bers' algebraic characterization of the relation of conformality, we show that the topology on \mathcal{A}(\Omega) is the only Polish topology for which \mathcal{A}(\Omega) is a Polish ring for arbitrary open \Omega. In a different direction, we show that the bounded complex-analytic functions on the unit disk admits no Polish topology for which it is a Polish ring. Along these lines, a corollary of our general result is that the abstract field of meromorphic functions on an open \Omega cannot be made into a Polish field. We also study the Lie ring structure on \mathcal{A}(\Omega) which turns out to be a Polish Lie ring with the usual topology. In this case, we restrict our attention to those domains \Omega that are connected. We extend a result of Amemiya to see that the Lie ring structure is determined by the conformal structure of \Omega. In a similar vein to our ring considerations, we see that, for certain domains \Omega of usual interest, the Lie ring \mathcal{A}(\Omega) has a unique Polish topology for which it is a Polish Lie ring.
