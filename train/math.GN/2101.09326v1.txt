An n-valued map is a set-valued continuous function f such that f(x) has cardinality n for every x. Some n-valued maps will "split" into a union of n single-valued maps. Characterizations of splittings has been a major theme in the topological theory of n-valued maps.   In this paper we consider the more general notion of "partitions" of an n-valued map, in which a given map is decomposed into a union of other maps which may not be single-valued. We generalize several splitting characterizations which will describe partitions in terms of mixed configuration spaces and mixed braid groups, and connected components of the graph of f. We demonstrate the ideas with some examples on tori.   We also discuss the fixed point theory of n-valued maps and their partitions, and make some connections to the theory of finite-valued maps due to Crabb.
