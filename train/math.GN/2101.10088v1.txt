Given a completely metrizable space X, let \mathfrak{par}(X) denote the smallest possible size of a partition of X into Polish spaces, and \mathfrak{cov}(X) the smallest possible size of a covering of X with Polish spaces. Observe that \mathfrak{cov}(X) \leq \mathfrak{par}(X) for every X, because every partition of X is also a covering. We prove it is consistent relative to a huge cardinal that the strict inequality \mathfrak{cov}(X) < \mathfrak{par}(X) can hold for some completely metrizable space X. We also prove that using large cardinals is necessary for obtaining this strict inequality, because if \mathfrak{cov}(X) < \mathfrak{par}(X) for any completely metrizable X, then 0^\dagger exists.
