The fixed-circle problem is a recent problem about the study of geometric properties of the fixed point set of a self-mapping on metric (resp. generalized metric) spaces. The fixed-disc problem occurs as a natural consequence of this problem. Our aim in this paper, is to investigate new classes of self-mappings which satisfy new specific type of contraction on a metric space. We see that the fixed point set of any member of these classes contains a circle (or a disc) called the fixed circle (resp. fixed disc) of the corresponding self-mapping. For this purpose, we introduce the notions of an F_{c}-contractive mapping and an F_{c}-expanding mapping. Activation functions with fixed circles (resp. fixed discs) are often seen in the study of neural networks. This shows the effectiveness of our fixed-circle (resp. fixed-disc) results. In this context, our theoretical results contribute to future studies on neural networks.
