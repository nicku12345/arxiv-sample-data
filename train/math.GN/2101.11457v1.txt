In this paper we develop a new approach to the study of uncountable fundamental groups by using Hurewicz fibrations with the unique path-lifting property (lifting spaces for short) as a replacement for covering spaces. In particular, we consider the inverse limit of a sequence of covering spaces of X. It is known that the path-connectivity of the inverse limit can be expressed by means of the derived inverse limit functor \varprojlim^1, which is, however, notoriously difficult to compute when the \pi_1(X) is uncountable.To circumvent this difficulty, we express the set of path-components of the inverse limit, \widehat X, in terms of the functors \varprojlim and \varprojlim^1 applied to sequences of countable groups arising from polyhedral approximations of X.   A consequence of our computation is that path-connectedness of lifting space implies that \pi_1(\tilde X) supplements \pi_1(X) in \check\pi_1(X) where \check\pi_1(X) is the inverse limit of fundamental groups of polyhedral approximations of X. As an application we show that \mathcal G\cdot \ker_{\mathbb Z}(\widehat F)= \widehat F\ne\mathcal G\cdot \ker_{B(1,n)}(\widehat F), where \widehat F is the canonical inverse limit of finite rank free groups, \mathcal G is the fundamental group of the Hawaiian Earring, and \ker_A(\widehat F) is the intersection of kernels of homomorphisms from \widehat{F} to A.
