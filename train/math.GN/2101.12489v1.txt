We show that the construction of a random continuum \mathcal{C} from independent two-sided Brownian motions as considered in arXiv:2004.01367 almost surely yields a non-degenerate indecomposable but not-hereditary indecomposable continuum. In particular \mathcal{C} is (unfortunately) not the pseudo-arc.
