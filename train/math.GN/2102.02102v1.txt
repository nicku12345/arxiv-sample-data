The paper alluded to in the title contains the following striking result: Let I be the unit interval and \Delta the Cantor set. If X is a quasi Banach space containing no copy of c_0 which is isomorphic to a closed subspace of a space with a basis and C(I, X) is linearly homeomorphic to C(\Delta, X), then X is locally convex, i.e., a Banach space.   It is shown that Kalton result is sharp by exhibiting non locally convex quasi Banach spaces X with a basis for which C(I, X) and C(\Delta, X) are isomorphic. Our examples are rather specific and actually in all cases X is isomorphic to C(\Delta, X) if K is a metric compactum of finite covering dimension.
