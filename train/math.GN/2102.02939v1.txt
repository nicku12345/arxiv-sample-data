In 1972, Dana Scott proved a fundamental result on the connection between order and topology which says that injective T_0 spaces are precisely continuous lattices endowed with Scott topology. This paper investigates whether this is true in the enriched context, where the enrichment is a quantale obtained by equipping the interval [0,1] with a continuous t-norm. It is shown that for each continuous t-norm, the specialization [0,1]-order of an injective and separated [0,1]-approach space X is a continuous [0,1]-lattice and the [0,1]-approach structure of X coincides with the Scott [0,1]-approach structure of the specialization [0,1]-order; but, unlike in the classical situation, the converse fails in general.
