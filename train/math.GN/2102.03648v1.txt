Let M be an ANR space and X be a homotopy dense subspace in M. Assume that M admits a continuous binary operation *:M\times M\to M such that for every x,y\in M the inclusion x*y\in X holds if and only if x,y\in X. Assume also that there exist continuous unary operations u,v:M\to M such that x=u(x)*v(x) for all x\in M. Given a 2^\omega-stable \mathbf \Pi^0_2-hereditary weakly \mathbf \Sigma^0_2-additive class of spaces \mathcal C, we prove that the pair (M,X) is strongly (\mathbf \Pi^0_1\cap\mathcal C,\mathcal C)-universal if and only if for any compact space K\in\mathcal C, subspace C\in\mathcal C of K and nonempty open set U\subseteq M there exists a continuous map f:K\to U such that f^{-1}[X]=C. This characterization is applied to detecting strongly universal Lawson semilattices.
