A coarse compactification of a proper metric space X is any compactification of X that is dominated by its Higson compactification. In this paper we describe the maximal coarse compactification of X whose corona is of dimension 0. In case of geodesic spaces X, it coincides with the Freundenthal compactification of X. As an application we provide an alternative way of extending the concept of the number of ends from finitely generated groups to arbitrary countable groups. We present a geometric proof of a generalization of Stallings' theorem by showing that any countable group of two ends contains an infinite cyclic subgroup of finite index. Finally, we define ends of arbitrary coarse spaces.
