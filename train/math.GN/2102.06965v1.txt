In this paper, we have introduced first the notion of rough I^*-convergence in a normed linear space as an extension work of rough I-convergence and then rough I^K-convergence in more general way. Then we have studied some properties on these two newly introduced ideas. We also examined the relationship between rough I-convergence with both of rough I^*-convergence and rough I^K-convergence.
