Here we have introduced the ideas of  (j-i)sg_\kappa^*-closed sets and a semi generalized closed set in a bispace;  i,j=1,2; i\not=j  and then have studied on pairwise semi T_0 -axiom, pairwise semi T_1 -axiom and pairwise semi T_\omega -axiom. We have investigated some of their topological properties and also established a relation among these axioms under some additional conditions.
