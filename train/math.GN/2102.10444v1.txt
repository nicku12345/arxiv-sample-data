In 1971 I announced what I described as a nice proof of Tychonoff's Theorem, an immediate corollary of a result concerning closed projections combined with Mrowka's characterization of compactness: a space X is compact if and only if for each space Y the projection from X x Y to Y is closed. I described the proof as to appear but to date it has not. In 2019 I published a generalization of the stronger closed projection result which yields a different look to the proof. Both versions are presented here.
