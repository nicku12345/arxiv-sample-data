Using methods from nonstandard analysis, we define a nonstandard Minkowski dimension which exists for all bounded sets and which has the property that \dim(A\times B) = \dim(A) + \dim(B).That is, our new dimension is product-summable. To illustrate our theorem we generalize an example of Falconer's to show that the standard upper Minkowski dimension, as well as the Hausdorff dimension, are not product-summable. We also include a method for creating sets of arbitrary rational dimension.
