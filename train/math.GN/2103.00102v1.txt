Erd\H{o}s space \mathfrak{E} and complete Erd\H{o}s space \mathfrak{E}_c have been previously shown to have topological characterizations. In this paper, we provide a topological characterization of the topological space \mathbb{Q}\times\mathfrak{E}_c, where \mathbb{Q} is the space of rational numbers. As a corollary, we show that the Vietoris hyperspace of finite sets \mathcal{F}(\mathfrak{E}_c) is homeomorphic to \mathbb{Q}\times\mathfrak{E}_c. We also characterize the factors of \mathbb{Q}\times\mathfrak{E}_c. An interesting open question that is left open is whether \sigma{\mathfrak{E}_c}^\omega, the \sigma-product of countably many copies of \mathfrak{E}_c, is homeomorphic to \mathbb{Q}\times\mathfrak{E}_c.
