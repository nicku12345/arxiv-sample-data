A new protomodular analog of the classical criterion for the existence of a group term in the algebraic theory of a variety of universal algebras is given. To this end, the notion of a right-cancellable protomodular algebra is introduced. It is proved that the algebraic theory of a variety of universal algebras contains a group term if and only if it contains protomodular terms with respect to which all algebras from the variety are right-cancellable. This, in particular, gives a partial answer to the extended version of an open problem from loop theory whether any Hausdorff topological (semi-)loop is completely regular. Moreover, the right-cancellable algebras from the simplest protomodular varieties are characterized as sets with principal group actions as well as groups with simple additional structures.
