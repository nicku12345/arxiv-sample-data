We discuss two problems concerning the class Eberlein compacta, i.e., weakly compact subspaces of Banach spaces. The first one deals with preservation of some classes of scattered Eberlein compacta under continuous images. The second one concerns the known problem of the existence of nonmetrizable compact spaces without nonmetrizable zero-dimensional closed subspaces. We show that the existence of such Eberlein compacta is consistent with ZFC. We also show that it is consistent with ZFC that each Eberlein compact space of weight > \omega_1 contains a nonmetrizable closed zero-dimensional subspace.
