Miller et al. (2010) introduced a set-valued functor \sigma on the coarse category. To compute this functor easier, Imamura (2020) introduced a similar set-valued functor \iota on the coarse category and a natural transformation \omega\colon\sigma\to\iota using nonstandard analysis. The surjectivity of \omega was proved for all proper geodesic spaces. In the present note, the injectivity of \omega is proved for all metric spaces. This answers problems posed in Imamura (2020) for metrisable spaces.
