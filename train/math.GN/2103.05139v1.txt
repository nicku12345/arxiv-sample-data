A strong generalized topological space is an ordered pair \mathbf{X}=\langle X, \mathcal{T}\rangle such that X is a set and \mathcal{T} is a collection of subsets of X such that \emptyset, X\in \mathcal{T} and \mathcal{T} is stable under arbitrary unions. A necessary and sufficient condition for a strong generalized topological space \mathbf{X} to satisfy Urysohn's lemma or its appropriate variant is shown in \mathbf{ZF}. Notions of a U-normal and an effectively normal generalized topological space are introduced. It is observed that, in \mathbf{ZF}+\mathbf{DC}, every U-normal generalized topological space satisfies Urysohn's lemma. It is shown that every effectively normal generalized topological space satisfies Csasz\'ar's modification of Urysohn's Lemma. A \mathbf{ZF}- example of a strong generalized topological normal space which satisfies the Tietze-Urysohn Extension Theorem and fails to satisfy Urysohn's Lemma is shown.
