What topological spaces can be partitioned into copies of the Cantor space 2^\omega? An obvious necessary condition is that a space can be partitioned into copies of 2^\omega only if it can be covered with copies of 2^\omega. We prove three theorems concerning when this necessary condition is also sufficient.   If X is a metrizable space and |X| \leq \mathfrak{c}^{+\omega} (the least limit cardinal >\!\mathfrak{c}), then X can be partitioned into copies of 2^\omega if and only if X can be covered with copies of 2^\omega. To show this cardinality bound is sharp, we construct a metrizable space of size \mathfrak{c}^{+(\omega+1)} that can be covered with copies of 2^\omega, but not partitioned into copies of 2^\omega.   Similarly, if X is first countable and |X| \leq \mathfrak{c}, then X can be partitioned into copies of 2^\omega if and only if X can be covered with copies of 2^\omega. On the other hand, there is a first countable space of size \mathfrak{c}^+ that can be covered with copies of 2^\omega, but not partitioned into copies of 2^\omega.   Finally, we show that a completely metrizable space can be partitioned into copies of 2^\omega if and only if it can be covered with copies of 2^\omega if and only if it has no isolated points.
