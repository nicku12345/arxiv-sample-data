Hurewicz found connections between some topological notions and the combinatorial cardinals b and d. Reclaw gave topological meaning to the definition of the cardinal p. We extend the picture with a topological interpretation of the cardinal t. We compare our notion to the one related to p, and to some other classical notions. This sheds new light on the famous open problem whether p=t.
