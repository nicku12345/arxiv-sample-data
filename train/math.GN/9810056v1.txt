We discuss the problem of finding an analogue of the concept of a topological space in supergeometry, motivated by a search for a procedure to compactify a supermanifold along odd coordinates. In particular, we examine the topologies naturally arising on the sets of points of locally ringed superspaces, and show that in the presence of a nontrivial odd sector such topologies are never compact. The main outcome of our discussion is that not only the usual framework of supergeometry (the theory of locally ringed spaces), but the more general approach of the functor of points, need to be further enlarged.
