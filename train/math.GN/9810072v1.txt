Recently, Mr\v{s}evi\'{c} and Reilly discussed some covering properties of a topological space and its associated \alpha-topology in both topological and bitopological ways. The main aim of this paper is to investigate some common and controversial covering properties of \cal T and {\cal T}^{\alpha}.
