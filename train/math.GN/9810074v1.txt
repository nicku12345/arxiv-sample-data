The aim of this paper is to introduce a new weak separation axiom that generalizes the separation properties between T_1 and completely Hausdorff. We call a topological space (X,\tau) a T_{\kappa,\xi}-space if every compact subset of X with cardinality \leq \kappa is \xi-closed, where \xi is a general closure operator. We concentrate our attention mostly on two new concepts: kd-spaces and T_{1/3}-spaces.
