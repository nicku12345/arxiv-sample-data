An ideal is a nonempty collection of subsets closed under heredity and finite additivity. The aim of this paper is to unify some weak separation properties via topological ideals. We concentrate our attention on the separation axioms between T_0 and T_2. We prove that if (X,\tau,{\cal I}) is a semi-Alexandroff T_{\cal I}-space and \cal I is a \tau-boundary, then \cal I is completely codense.
