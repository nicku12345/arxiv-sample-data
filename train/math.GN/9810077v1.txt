The aim of this paper is to show that every scattered subset of a dense-in-itself semi-T_D-space is nowhere dense. We are thus able to answer a recent question of Coleman in the affirmative. In terms of Digital Topology, we prove that in semi-T_D-spaces with no open screen, trace spaces have no consolidations.
