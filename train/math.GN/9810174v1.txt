The aim of this paper is to continue the study of sg-compact spaces. The class of sg-compact spaces is a proper subclass of the class of hereditarily compact spaces. In our paper we shall consider sg-compactness in product spaces. Our main result says that if a product space is sg-compact, then either all factor spaces are finite, or exactly one factor space is infinite and sg-compact and the remaining ones are finite and locally indiscrete.
