The natural duality between "topological" and "regular," both considered as convergence space properties, extends naturally to p-regular convergence spaces, resulting in the new concept of a p-topological convergence space. Taking advantage of this duality, the behavior of p-topological and p-regular convergence spaces is explored, with particular emphasis on the former, since they have not been previously studied. Their study leads to the new notion of a neighborhood operator for filters, which in turn leads to an especially simple characterization of a topology in terms of convergence criteria. Applications include the topological and regularity series of a convergence space.
