It is shown, under the assumption of Jensen's principle \lozenge, that if for a complex L with [L] \geq [S^{4}] there exists a metrizable compactum whose extension dimension is L, then there exists a differentiable, countably compact, perfectly normal and hereditarily separable 4-manifold whose extension dimension is also [L].
