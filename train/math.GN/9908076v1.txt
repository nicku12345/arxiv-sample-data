We discuss compact Hausdorff groups from the point of view of the general theory of absolute extensors. In particular, we characterize the class of simple, connected and simply connected compact Lie groups as AE(2)-groups the third homotopy group of which is \text{\f Z}. This is the converse of the corresponding result of R. Bott.
