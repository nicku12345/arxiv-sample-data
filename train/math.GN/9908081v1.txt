For any countable CW-complex K and a cardinal number \tau\geq\omega we construct a completely metrizable space X(K,\tau) of weight \tau with the following properties: \e X(K,\tau)\leq K, X(K,\tau) is an absolute extensor for all normal spaces Y with \e Y\leq K, and for any completely metrizable space Z of weight \leq\tau and \e Z\leq K the set of closed embeddings Z\to X(K,\tau) is dense in the space C(Z,X(K,\tau)) of all continuous maps from Z into X(K,\tau) endowed with the limitation topology. This result is applied to prove the existence of universal spaces for all metrizable spaces of given weight and with a given cohomological dimension.
