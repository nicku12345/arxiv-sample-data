We obtain several results and examples concerning the general question ``When must a space with a small diagonal have a G_delta-diagonal?". In particular, we show (1) every compact metrizably fibered space with a small diagonal is metrizable; (2) there are consistent examples of regular Lindelof (even hereditarily Lindelof) spaces with a small diagonal but no G_delta-diagonal; (3) every first-countable hereditarily Lindelof space with a small diagonal has a G_delta-diagonal; (4) assuming CH, every Lindelof Sigma-space with a small diagonal has a countable network; (5) whether countably compact spaces with a small diagonal are metrizable depends on your set theory; (6) there is a locally compact space with a small diagonal but no G_delta diagonal.
