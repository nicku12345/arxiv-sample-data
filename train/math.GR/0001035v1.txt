It is shown how to use a small finite state automaton in two variables in order to carry out the Knuth-Bendix process for rewriting words in a group in shortlex order. The two-variable automaton can be used to store an infinite set of rules and to carry out fast reduction of arbitrary words using this infinite set. We introduce a new operation, which we call welding, which applies to an arbitrary finite state automaton. We show how to improve on the standard subset construction to determinize a non-deterministic automaton under special conditions which hold in our situation.
