In the first, mostly expository, part of this paper, a graded Lie algebra is associated to every group G given with an N-series of subgroups. The asymptotics of the Poincare series of this algebra give estimates on the growth of the group G. This establishes the existence of a gap between polynomial growth and growth of type e^{\sqrt n} in the class of residually-p groups, and gives examples of finitely generated p-groups of uniformly exponential growth. In the second part, we produce two examples of groups of finite width and describe their Lie algebras, introducing a notion of Cayley graph for graded Lie algebras. We compute explicitly their lower central and dimensional series, and outline a general method applicable to some other groups from the class of branch groups. These examples produce counterexamples to a conjecture on the structure of just-infinite groups of finite width.
