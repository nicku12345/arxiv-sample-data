In 1996 E. Formanek classified all the irreducible complex representations of B_n of dimension at most n-1, where B_n is the Artin braid group on n strings. In this paper we extend this classification to the representations of dimension n, for n\geq 9. We prove that all such representations are equivalent to a tensor product of a one-dimensional representation and a specialization of a certain one-parameter family of n-dimensional representations, that was first discovered in 1996 by Tong, Yang, and Ma. We use our classification of irreducible complex representations of corank two, in the preprint math.GR/0003047.
