Diffeomorphism groups G of manifolds M on locally \bf F-convex spaces over non-Archimedean fields \bf F are investigated. It is shown that their structure has many differences with the diffeomorphism groups of real and complex manifolds. It is proved that G is not a Banach-Lie group, but it has a neighbourhood W of the unit element e such that each element g in W belongs to at least one corresponding one-parameter subgroup.   It is proved that G is simple and perfect. Its compact subgroups G_c are studied such that a dimension over \bf F of its tangent space dim_{\bf F}T_eG_c in e may be infinite. This is used for decompositions of continuous representations into irreducible and investigations of induced representations.
