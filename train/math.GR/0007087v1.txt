There has been interest recently concerning when a left ordered group is locally indicable. Bergman and Tararin have shown that not all left ordered groups are locally indicable, but all known examples contain a nonabelian free subgroup. We shall show for a large class of groups not containing a nonabelian free subgroup, that any left ordered group in this class is locally indicable. Specifically this class is the smallest class of groups containing NS and Thompson's group of piecewise linear homeomorphisms of the unit interval, and is closed under taking subgroups, quotient groups, extensions and directed unions; here NS is the class of groups which do not contain a nonabelian subsemigroup. We shall also show that certain free products with an amalgamated cyclic subgroup are left orderable.
