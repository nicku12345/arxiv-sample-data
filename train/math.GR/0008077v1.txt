In this paper we establish some subnormal embeddings of groups into groups with additional properties; in particular embeddings of countable groups into 2-generated groups with some extra properties. The results obtained are generalizations of theorems of P. Hall, R. Dark, B. Neumann, Hanna Neumann, G. Higman on embeddings of that type. Considering subnormal embeddings of finite groups into finite groups with additional properties we bring some illustration to a result of H. Heineken and J. Lennox.
