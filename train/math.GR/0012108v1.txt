In 1980 Rostislav Grigorchuk constructed a group G of intermediate growth, and later obtained the following estimates on its growth function: e^{\sqrt{n}}\precsim\gamma(n)\precsim e^{n^\beta}, where \beta=\log_{32}(31)\approx0.991. Using elementary methods we bring the upper bound down to \log(2)/\log(2/\eta)\approx0.767, where \eta\approx0.811 is the real root of the polynomial X^3+X^2+X-2.
