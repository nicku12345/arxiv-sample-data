Let G be a branch group (as defined by Grigorchuk) acting on a tree T. A parabolic subgroup P is the stabiliser of an infinite geodesic ray in T. We denote by \rho_{G/P} the associated quasi-regular representation.   If G is discrete, these representations are irreducible, but if G is profinite, they split as a direct sum of finite-dimensionalrepresentations \rho_{G/P_{n+1}}\ominus\rho_{G/P_n}, where P_n is the stabiliser of a level-n vertex in T.   For a few concrete examples, we completely split \rho_{G/P_n} in irreducible components. (G,P_n) and (G,P) are Gelfand pairs, whence new occurrences of abelian Hecke algebra.
