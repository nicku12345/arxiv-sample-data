Stochastic processes are considered on free loop spaces, geometric loop and diffeomorphism groups of real and complex manifolds. They are used for investigations of Wiener differentiable quasi-invariant measures on such groups relative to dense subgroups. There are considered finite-dimensional and also infinite-dimensional manifolds. Such measures are used for the investigation of associated unitary representations of these groups.
