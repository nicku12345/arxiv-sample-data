We give necessary and sufficient conditions for weak and strong embeddability of amalgams in each subvariety of the category of all nilpotent groups of class at most two; this generalizes B. Maier's result for the latter class. We also discuss dominions (in the sense of Isbell), and characterize the weak, strong, and special amalgamation bases for each subvariety, contrasting the resulting classes with one another.
