Birman, Ko and Lee have introduced a new monoid {\cal B}^{*}_{n}--with an explicit presentation--whose group of fractions is the n-strand braid group {\cal B}_{n}. Building on a new approach by Digne, Michel and himself, Bessis has defined a {\it dual} braid monoid for every finite Coxeter type Artin-Tits group extending the type A case. Here, we give an explicit presentation for this dual braid monoid in the case of types B and D, and we study the combinatorics of the underlying Garside structures.
