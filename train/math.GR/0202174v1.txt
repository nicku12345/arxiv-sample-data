Let (A_S,S) be an Artin-Tits and X a subset of S ; denote by A_X the subgroup of A_S generated by X. When A_S is of spherical type, we prove that the normalizer and the commensurator of A_X in A_S are equal and are the product of A_X by the quasi-centralizer of A_X in A_S. Looking to the associated monoids A_S^+ and A_X^+, we describe the quasi-centralizer of A_X^+ in A_S^+ thanks to results in Coxeter groups. These two results generalize earlier results of Paris. Finaly, we compare, in the spherical case, the normalizer of a parabolic subgroup in the Artin-Tits group and in the   Coxeter group.
