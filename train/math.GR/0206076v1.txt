We determine the Lusztig restrictions on the space of class functions with a unipotent support on a finite reductive group. In particular we give a simple expression for the Lusztig restrictions of the generalized Green functions and we describe the Lusztig restrictions of the generalized Gelfand-Graev representations. We make explicit computations for the Gelfand-Graev representations associated to the subregular unipotent class. In the case of SLn we show that the computations can be reduced to the case of GLn' for various n'.
