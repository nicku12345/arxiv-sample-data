This work examines the commutator structure of some closed subgroups of the wild group of automorphisms of a local field with perfect residue field, a group we call \Cal J. In particular, we establish a new approach to evaluating commutators in \Cal J and using this method investigate the normal subgroup structure of some classes of index subgroups of \Cal J as introduced by Klopsch. We provide new proofs of Fesenko\rq s results that lead to a proof that the torsion free group T =\{t+\sum_{k\geq 1} a_kt^{qk+1}: a_k \in \Bbb F_p\} is hereditarily just infinite, and by extending his work, we also demonstrate the existence of a new class of hereditarily just infinite subgroups of \Cal J which have non-trivial torsion.
