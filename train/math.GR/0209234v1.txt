A group G given by a presentation G = < \mathcal A \| \mathcal R > is called weakly finitely presented if every finitely generated subgroup of G, generated by (images of) some words in \mathcal A^{\pm 1}, is naturally isomorphic to the subgroup of a group G_0 = < \mathcal A_0 \| \mathcal R_0>, where \mathcal A_0 \subseteq \mathcal A, \mathcal R_0 \subseteq \mathcal R are finite, generated by (images of) the same words. In the article, weakly finitely presented periodic groups which are not locally finite are constructed.
