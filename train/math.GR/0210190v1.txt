A sufficient condition for the existence of HNN-extensions in the class of groups of odd exponent n \gg 1 is given in the following form. Let Q be a group of odd exponent n > 2^{48} and \mathcal G be an HNN-extension of Q. If A \in \mathcal G then let \mathcal F(A) denote the maximal subgroup of Q which is normalized by A. By \tau_A denote the automorphism of \mathcal F(A) which is induced by conjugation by A. Suppose that for every A \in \mathcal G, which is not conjugate to an element of Q, the group <\tau_A, \mathcal F(A)> has exponent n and, in addition, equalities A^{-k} q_0 A^{k} = q_k, where q_k \in Q and k =0, 1, ..., [2^{-16}n] ([2^{-16}n] is the integer part of 2^{-16}n), imply that q_0 \in \mathcal F(A). Then the group Q naturally embeds in the quotient \mathcal G / \mathcal G^n, that is, there exists an analog of the HNN-extension \mathcal G of Q in the class of groups of exponent n.
