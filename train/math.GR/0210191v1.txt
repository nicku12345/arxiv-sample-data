We prove that every noncyclic subgroup of a free m-generator Burnside group B(m,n) of odd exponent n \gg 1 contains a subgroup H isomorphic to a free Burnside group B(\infty,n) of exponent n and countably infinite rank such that for every normal subgroup K of H the normal closure <K >^{B(m,n)} of K in B(m,n) meets H in K. This implies that every noncyclic subgroup of B(m,n) is SQ-universal in the class of groups of exponent n.
