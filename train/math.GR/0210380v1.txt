A {\it Schmidt group} is a non-nilpotent finite group in which each proper subgroup is nilpotent. Each Schmidt group G can be described by three parameters p, q and v, where p and q are different primes and v is a natural number, v\ge 1. Denote by {\mathcal{S}} the class of all Schmidt groups which have the same parameters p, q and v. It is shown in this paper that the class {\mathcal{S}} can be characterized by the properties of the endomorphism semigroups of the groups of this class. It follows from this characterization that if G\in {\mathcal{S}} and H is another group such that the endomorphism semigroups of G and H are isomorphic, then H\in {\mathcal{S}}, too.
