We study some properties of the Cayley graph of the R.Thompson's group F in generators x_0, x_1. We show that the density of this graph, that is, the least upper bound of the average vertex degree of its finite subgraphs is at least 3. It is known that a 2-generated group is not amenable if and only if the density of the corresponding Cayley graph is strictly less than 4. It is well known this is also equivalent to the existence of a doubling function on the Cayley graph. This means there exists a mapping from the set of vertices into itself such that for some constant K>0, each vertex moves into the distance at most K and each vertex has at least two preimages. We show that the density of the Cayley graph of a 2-generated graph does not exceed 3 if and only if the group satisfies the above condition with K=1. Besides, we give a very easy formula to find the length (norm) of a given element of F in generators x_0, x_1. This simplifies the algorithm by Fordham. The length formula may be useful to find the general growth function of F in generators x_0, x_1 and the growth rate of this function. In this paper we show that the lower bound for the growth rate of F is (3+\sqrt5)/2.
