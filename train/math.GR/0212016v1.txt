Let c\geq 0, d\geq 2 be integers and \mathcal{N}_c^{(d)} be the variety of groups in which every d-generator subgroup is nilpotent of class at most c. N.D. Gupta posed this question that for what values of c and d it is true that \mathcal{N}_c^{(d)} is locally nilpotent? We prove that if c\leq 2^d+2^{d-1}-3 then the variety \mathcal{N}_c^{(d)} is locally nilpotent and we reduce the question of Gupta about the periodic groups in \mathcal{N}_c^{(d)} to the prime power finite exponent groups in this variety.
