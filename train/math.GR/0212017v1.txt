Let w be a word in the free group of rank n \in \mathbb{N} and let \mathcal{V}(w) be the variety of groups defined by the law w=1. Define \mathcal{V}(w^*) to be the class of all groups G in which for any infinite subsets X_1, ..., X_n there exist x_i \in X_i, 1\leq i\leq n, such that w(x_1, ..., x_n)=1. Clearly, \mathcal{V}(w) \cup \mathcal{F} \subseteq \mathcal{V}(w^*); \mathcal{F} being the class of finite groups. In this paper, we investigate some words w and some certain classes \mathcal{P} of groups for which the equality (\mathcal{V}(w) \cup \mathcal{F})\cap \mathcal{P}= \mathcal{P} \cap \mathcal{V}(w^*) holds.
