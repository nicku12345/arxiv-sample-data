In this paper we give necessary and sufficient conditions for discreteness of a group generated by a hyperbolic element and an elliptic one of odd order. This completes the classification of discrete groups with non-\pi-loxodromic generators in the class of two-generator groups with real parameters. The criterion is given also as a list of all parameters that correspond to discrete groups. An interesting corollary of the result is that the group of the minimal known volume hyperbolic orbifold has real parameters.
