We study contraction groups for automorphisms of totally disconnected locally compcat groups using the scale of the automorphism as a tool. The contraction group is shown to be unbounded when the inverse automorphism has non-trivial scale and this scale is shown to be the inverse value of the modular function on the closure of the contraction group at the automorphism. The closure of the contraction group is represented as acting on a homogenous tree and closed contraction groups are characterised.
