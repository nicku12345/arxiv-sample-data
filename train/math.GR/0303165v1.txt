In the paper we characterize the class of finite solvable groups by two-variable identities in a way similar to the characterization of finite nilpotent groups by Engel identities. More precisely, a sequence of words u_1,...,u_n,...  is called correct if u_k\equiv 1 in a group G implies u_m\equiv 1 in a group G for all m>k. We are looking for an explicit correct sequence of words u_1(x,y),...,u_n(x,y),... such that a group G is solvable if and only if for some n the word u_n is an identity in G.   Let u_1=x^{-2}y\min x, and u_{n+1} = [xu_nx\min,yu_ny\min]. The main result states that a finite group G is solvable if and only if for some n the identity u_n(x,y)\equiv 1 holds in G. In the language of profinite groups this result implies that the provariety of prosolvable groups is determined by a single explicit proidentity in two variables.   The proof of the main theorem relies on reduction to J.Thompson's list of minimal non-solvable simple groups, on extensive use of arithmetic geometry (Lang - Weil bounds, Deligne's machinery, estimates of Betti numbers, etc.) and on computer algebra and geometry (SINGULAR, MAGMA) .
