Let F be a nonarchimedean local field, and G the group of F-points of a c onnected quasisplit reductive group defined on F; in this paper, we will study the distributions on G which are invariant by conjugation, and the vector spa ce of their restrictions to the Hecke algebra \mathcal{H} of the functions on G with compact support and biinvariant by a given Iwahori subgroup I. It is first shown that such a distribution on \mathcal{H} is entirely determined by its restriction to the finite-diimensional subspace of \mathcal{H} containing the elements with support in the union of the parahoric subgroups of G contai ning I; this property is then used, by establishing similar results on finite groups, to show, with some conditions on G, that this space is generated both by some semisimple orbital integrals and by unipotent integrals.
