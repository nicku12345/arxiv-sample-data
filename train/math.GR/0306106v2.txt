We show that if \cal S is a compact Riemann surface of genus g = p+1, where p is prime, with a group of automorphisms G such that |G|\geq\lambda(g-1) for some real number \lambda>6, then for all sufficiently large p (depending on \lambda), \cal S and G lie in one of six infinite sequences of examples. In particular, if \lambda=8 then this holds for all p\geq 17 and we obtain the largest groups of automorphisms of Riemann surfaces of genenera g=p+1.
