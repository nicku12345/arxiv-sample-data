We extend the techniques developed by Millson and Raghunathan to prove nonvanishing results for the cohomology of compact arithmetic quotients of hyperbolic n-space with values in the local coefficient systems associated to finite dimensional irreducible representations of the group SO(n,1). We prove that all possible nonvanishing results compatible with the vanishing theorems of Vogan and Zuckerman can be realized by any sufficiently deep congruence subgroup of the standard cocompact arithmetic examples.
