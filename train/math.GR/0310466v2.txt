We describe a family of words in Thompson's group F which present a challenge to the question of finding canonical minimal length representatives, and which show that F is not combable by geodesics. These words have the property that there are only two possible suffixes of long lengths for geodesic paths to the word from the identity; one is of the form g^k and the other of the form g^{-k} where g is a generator of the group.
