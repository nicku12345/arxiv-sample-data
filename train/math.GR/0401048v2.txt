We prove that that for all \eps, having cogrowth exponent at most 1/2+\eps (in base 2m-1 with m the number of generators) is a generic property of groups in the density model of random groups. This generalizes a theorem of Grigorchuk and Champetier. More generally we show that the cogrowth of a random quotient of a torsion-free hyperbolic group stays close to that of this group.   This proves in particular that the spectral gap of a generic group is as large as it can be.
