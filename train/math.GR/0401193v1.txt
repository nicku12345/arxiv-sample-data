A loop (X,\circ) is said to be a Bruck loop if it satisfies the (right) Bol identity ((z\circ x)\circ y)\circ x = z\circ ((x\circ y)\circ x) and the automorphic inverse property (x\circ y)^{-1}=x^{-1}\circ y^{-1}. If X is a finite Bruck loop and G is the group generated by all right translations R(x): y\mapsto y\circ x, then we show that X and G are central products X = O^{2'}(X) * O(X) and G = O^{2'}(G) * O(G), where O^{2'}(X) (O^{2'}(G)) is the subloop (subgroup) generated by all 2-elements, and O(X) (O(G)) is the largest normal subloop (subgroup) of odd order. In particular, if X is solvable, then these central products are direct products. We also give a set of necessary conditions that must hold for a finite Bruck loop X to be nonsolvable but have each proper section solvable; in particular, X must be simple and consist of 2-elements, while the quotient of G by its largest normal 2-subgroup must be isomorphic to PGL_2(q), with q=2^n+1\geq 5.
