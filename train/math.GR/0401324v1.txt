We construct a quasi-Garside monoid structure for the free group. This monoid should be thought of as a dual braid monoid for the free group, generalising the constructions by Birman-Ko-Lee and by the author of new Garside monoids for Artin groups of spherical type. Conjecturally, an analog construction should be available for arbitrary Artin groups and for braid groups of well-generated complex reflection groups.
