We discuss the following question of G. Makanin from ``Kourovka notebook'': does there exist an algorithm to determine is for an arbitrary pair of words U and V of a free group F_n and an arbitrary automorphism \phi \in Aut(F_n) the equation \phi (X) U = V X solvable in F_n? We give the affirmative answer in the case when an automorphism is virtually inner, i.e. some its non-zero power is an inner automorphism of F_n.
