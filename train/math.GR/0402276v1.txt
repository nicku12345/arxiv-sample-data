A semisimple element s of a connected reductive group G is said {\it quasi-isolated} (respectively {\it isolated}) if C_G(s) (respectively C_G^0(s)) is not contained in a Levi subgroup of a proper parabolic subgroup of G. We study properties of quasi-isolated semisimple elements and give a classification in terms of the affine Dynkin diagram of G. Tables are provided for adjoint simple groups.
