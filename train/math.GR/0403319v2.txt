In this paper we investigate the Bol loops and connected with them groups. We prove an analog of the Doro's theorem for Moufang loops and find a criterion for simplicity of Bol loops. One of the main results obtained is the following: if the right multiplication group of a connected finite Bol loop S is a simple group, then S is a Moufang loop.
