The braid group B_n maps homomorphically into the Temperley-Lieb algebra \TL_n. It was shown by Zinno that the homomorphic images of simple elements arising from the dual presentation of the braid group B_n form a basis for the vector space underlying the Temperley-Lieb algebra \TL_n. In this paper, we establish that there is a dual presentation of Temperley-Lieb algebras that corresponds to the dual presentation of braid groups, and then give a simple geometric proof for Zinno's theorem, using the interpretation of simple elements as non-crossing partitions.
