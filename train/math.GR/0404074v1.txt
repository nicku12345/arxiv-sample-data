The aim of this note is to show that weak relative hyperbolicity of a group relative to a subgroup (or relative hyperbolicity in the sense of Farb) does not imply any natural analogues of some well-known algebraic properties of ordinary hyperbolic groups. Our main tools are combination theorems for weakly relatively hyperbolic groups.
