We show that for any metric space M satisfying certain natural conditions, there is a finitely generated group G, an ultrafilter \omega , and an isometric embedding \iota  of M to the asymptotic cone {\rm Cone}_\omega (G) such that the induced homomorphism \iota ^ \ast :\pi_1(M)\to \pi_1({\rm Cone}_\omega (G)) is injective. In particular, we prove that any countable group can be embedded into a fundamental group of an asymptotic cone of a finitely generated group.
