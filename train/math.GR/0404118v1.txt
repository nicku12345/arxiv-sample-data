Let G be a group hyperbolic relative to a collection of subgroups \{H_\lambda ,\lambda \in \Lambda \} . We say that a subgroup Q\le G is hyperbolically embedded into G, if G is hyperbolic relative to \{H_\lambda ,\lambda \in \Lambda \} \cup \{Q\} . In this paper we obtain a characterization of hyperbolically embedded subgroups. In particular, we show that if an element g\in G has infinite order and is not conjugate to an element of H_\lambda , \lambda \in \Lambda , then the (unique) maximal elementary subgroup contained g is hyperbolically embedded into G. This allows to prove that if G is boundedly generated, then G is elementary or H_\lambda =G for some \lambda \in \Lambda .
