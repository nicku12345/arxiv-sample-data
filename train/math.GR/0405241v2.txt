We study Cartesian decompositions of sets that are acted upon intransitively by innately transitive permutation groups. We prove that such groups have at most three orbits on such a decomposition. A consequence of this result is that if G is an innately transitive subgroup of a wreath product in product action then the natural projection of G into the top group has at most 2 orbits.
