Some properties of abnormal subgroups in generalized soluble groups will be considered. In particular, the transitivity of abnormality in metahypercentral groups is proven. Also it will be proven that a subgroup H of a radical group G is abnormal in G if and only if every intermediate subgroup for H coincides with its normalizer in G. This result will extend on radical groups the well-known criterion of abnormality for finite soluble groups obtained by D. Taunt. For some infinite groups (not only periodic) the existence of Carter subgroups and their conjugations will be also proven.
