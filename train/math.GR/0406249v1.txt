Let \Gamma denote the modular group SL(2,\Bbb Z) and C_n(\Gamma) the number of congruence subgroups of \Gamma of index at most n. We prove that \lim\limits_{n\to \infty} \frac{\log C_n(\Gamma)}{(\log n)^2/\log\log n} = \frac{3-2\sqrt{2}}{4}. We also present a very general conjecture giving an asymptotic estimate for C_n(\Gamma) for general arithmetic groups. The lower bound of the conjecture is proved modulo the generalized Riemann hypothesis for Artin-Hecke L-functions, and in many cases is also proved unconditionally.
