We prove that every free metabelian non--cyclic group has a finitely generated isolated subgroup which is not separable in the class of nilpotent groups.   As a corollary we prove that for every prime number p an arbitrary free metabelian non--cyclic group has a finitely generated p'--isolated subgroup which is not p--separable.
