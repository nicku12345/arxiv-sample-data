We prove that Thompson's groups F and V are the geometry groups of associativity, and of associativity together with commutativity, respectively. We deduce new presentations of F and V. These presentations lead to considering a certain subgroup of V and an extension of this subgroup. We prove that the latter are the geometry groups of associativity together with the law x(yz) = y(xz), and of associativity together with a twisted version of this law involving self-distributivity, respectively.
