Root-class residuality of free product of root-class residual groups is demonstrated. A sufficient condition for root-class residuality of generalized free product G of groups A and B amalgamating subgroups H and K through the isomorphism \phi is derived. For the particular case when A=B, H=K and \phi is the identity mapping, it is shown that group G is root-class residual if and only if A is root-class residual and subgroup H of A is root-class closed. These results are extended to generalized free product of infinitely many groups amalgamating a common subgroup.
