For each countable group Q we produce a short exact sequence 1\to N \to G \to Q\to 1 where G is f.g. and has a graphical \frac16 presentation and N is f.g. and satisfies property T. As a consequence we produce a group N with property T such that \Out(N) is infinite. Using the tools developed we are also able to produce examples of nonHopfian and non-coHopfian groups with property T. One of our main tools is the use of random groups to achieve certain properties.
