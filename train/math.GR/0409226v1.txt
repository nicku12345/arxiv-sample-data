We work in the density model of random groups. We prove that they satisfy an isoperimetric inequality with sharp constant 1-2d depending upon the density parameter d. This implies in particular a property generalizing the ordinary C' small cancellation condition, which could be termed ``macroscopic small cancellation''. This also sharpens the evaluation of the hyperbolicity constant \delta.   As a consequence we get that the standard presentation of a random group at density d<1/5 satisfies the Dehn algorithm and Greendlinger's Lemma, and that it does not for d>1/5.
