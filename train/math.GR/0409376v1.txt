We give a criterion for the non-vanishing of some generalised modular symbols. The criterion is in terms of the non-vanishing of some classes on the compact dual of the locally symmetric manifold. As an application, we construct non-zero modular symbols on SL(2n) over an imaginary quadratic extension of \Q, which turn out to be ghost classes.
