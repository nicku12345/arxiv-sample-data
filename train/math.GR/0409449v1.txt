The blow-up construction by L. G. Kov\'acs has been a very useful tool to study embeddings of finite primitive permutation groups into wreath products in product action. In the present paper we extend the concept of a blow-up to finite quasiprimitive permutation groups, and use it to study embeddings of finite quasiprimitive groups into wreath products.
