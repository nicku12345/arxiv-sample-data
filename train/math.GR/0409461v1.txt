Herein we prove that if M is a compact oriented Riemann surface of genus g, and M^{[n]} is the classifying space of n distinct, unordered points on M, then the kernel of the map \pi_1(M^{[n]})\to H_1(M) is generated by transpositions for sufficiently large n. Specifically, we treat M as a polyhedron, and the edge set of M generates this group.
