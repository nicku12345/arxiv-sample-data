We generalize the small cancellation theory over hyperbolic groups developed by Olshanskii to the case of relatively hyperbolic groups. This allows us to construct infinite finitely generated groups with exactly n conjugacy classes for every n\ge 2. In particular, we give the affirmative answer to the well--known question of the existence of a finitely generated group G other than \mathbb Z/2\mathbb Z such that all nontrivial elements of G are conjugate.
