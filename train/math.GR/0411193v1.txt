This paper is a sequel of [A.M. Cohen, L. Paris, {\it On a theorem of Artin}, J. Group Theory {\bf 6} (2003), 421--441]. Let A be an Artin group, let W be its associated Coxeter group, and let CA be its associated coloured Artin group, that is, the kernel of the standard epimorphism \mu: A \to W. We determine the homomorphisms \f: A \to W that verify \Im \f \cdot Z(W)= W, for A irreducible and of spherical type, and we prove that CA is a characteristic subgroup of A, if A is of spherical type but not necessarily irreducible.
