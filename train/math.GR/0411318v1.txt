In this paper, we determine the collineation groups generated by the Bol reflections, the core, the automorphism groups and the full direction preserving collineation groups of the loops B_{4n} and C_{4n} given by R.P. Burn. We also prove some lemmas and use new methods in order to simplify the calculations in these groups.
