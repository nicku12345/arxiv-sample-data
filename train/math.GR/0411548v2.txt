We classify all cross-sections of Green's relations \mathcal{L} and \mathcal{R} in the Brauer semigroup. The regular behavior of such cross-sections starts from n=7. We show that in the regular case there are essentially two different cross-sections and all others are \mathcal{S}_n-conjugated to one of these two. We also classify all cross-sections up to isomorphism.
