I. M. Isaacs has conjectured (see \cite{isa00}) that if the product of two faithful irreducible characters of a solvable group is irreducible, then the group is cyclic. In this paper we prove a special case of the following conjecture, which generalizes Isaacs conjecture. Suppose that G is solvable and that \psi,\phi\in\Irr(G) are faithful. If \psi \phi=m\chi where m is a positive integer and \chi \in \Irr(G) then \psi and \phi vanish on G- Z(G). In particular we prove that the above conjecture holds for p-groups.
