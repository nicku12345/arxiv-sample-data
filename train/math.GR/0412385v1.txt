Nearly twenty years ago Isaacs and the first author of this paper wrote a series of articles \cite{isa2}, \cite{da3}, \cite{da2} about what were called ``stabilizer limits'' of group characters, following the terminology of Berger \cite{be}. The second author, in her thesis \cite{lo}, needed one of the results of those articles in a new situation which was not treated earlier. Eventually she was able, by complicated and delicate arguments, to reduce her proof to a special case where \cite[Theorem 8.4]{da3} could be applied. But this approach was extremely awkward. In the present paper we use arguments similar to those in the earlier articles to prove a Main Theorem from which the exact Theorem A needed in \cite{lo} easily follows.
