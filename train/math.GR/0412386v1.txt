A finite group G is called monomial if every irreducible character of G is induced from a linear character of some subgroup of G. One of the main questions regarding monomial groups is whether or not a normal subgroup N of a monomial group G is itself monomial. In the case that G is a group of even order, it has been proved (Dade, van der Waall) that N need not be monomial. Here we show that, if G is a monomial group of order p^aq^b, where p and q are distinct odd primes, then any normal subgroup N of G is also monomial.
