In a previous paper, we defined a higher dimensional analog of Thompson's group V, and proved that it is simple, infinite, finitely generated, and not isomorphic to any of the known Thompson groups. There are other Thompson groups that are infinite, simple and finitely presented. Here we show that the new group is also finitely presented by calculating an explicit finite presentation.
