In this paper, we investigate boundaries of parabolic subgroups of Coxeter groups. Let (W,S) be a Coxeter system and let T be a subset of S such that the parabolic subgroup W_T is infinite. Then we show that if a certain set is quasi-dense in W, then W \partial\Sigma(W_T,T) is dense in the boundary \partial\Sigma(W,S) of the Coxeter system (W,S), where \partial\Sigma(W_T,T) is the boundary of (W_T,T).
