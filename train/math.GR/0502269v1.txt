In this paper, we give a class of reflection rigid Coxeter systems. Let (W,S) be a Coxeter system. Suppose that (1) for each s,t\in S such that m(s,t) is odd, \{s,t\} is a maximal spherical subset of S, (2) there does not exist a three-points subset \{s,t,u\}\subset S such that m(s,t) and m(t,u) are odd, and (3) for each s,t\in S such that m(s,t) is odd, the number of maximal spherical subsets of S intersecting with \{s,t\} is at most two, where m(s,t) is the order of st in the Coxeter group W. Then we show that the Coxeter system (W,S) is reflection rigid. This is an extension of a result of N.Brady, J.P.McCammond, B.M\"uhlherr and W.D.Neumann.
