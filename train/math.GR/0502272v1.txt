In this paper, we study the minimality of the boundary of a Coxeter system. We show that for a Coxeter system (W,S) if there exist a maximal spherical subset T of S and an element s_0\in S such that m(s_0,t)\ge 3 for each t\in T and m(s_0,t_0)=\infty for some t_0\in T, then every orbit W\alpha is dense in the boundary \partial\Sigma(W,S) of the Coxeter system (W,S), hence \partial\Sigma(W,S) is minimal, where m(s_0,t) is the order of s_0t in W.
