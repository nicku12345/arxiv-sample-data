Let F be a local complete field with discrete valuation, and let G be a quasi-split group over F which splits over some unramified extension of F. Let P be a parahoric subgroup of the group G(F) of F-points of G; t he open normal pro-nilpotent subgroups of P can be classified using the standa rd normal filtration subgroups of Prasad and Raghanathan. More precisely, we sho w that if G is quasi-simple and satisfies some additional conditions, H is, modulo a subgroup of some maximal torus of G, either one of these filtration s ubgroups or the product of one of them by a standard normal filtration subgroup of P\cap M, where M is a proper Levi subgroup of G.
