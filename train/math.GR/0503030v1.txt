Let G be a finite group and A be a normal subgroup of G. We denote by ncc(A) the number of G-conjugacy classes of A and A is called n-decomposable, if ncc(A)=n. Set {\cal K}_G = \{ncc(A)| A \lhd G \}. Let X be a non-empty subset of positive integers. A group G is called X-decomposable, if {\cal K}_G = X.   Ashrafi and his co-authors \cite{ash1,ash2,ash3,ash4,ash5} have characterized the X-decomposable non-perfect finite groups for X = \{1, n \} and n \leq 10. In this paper, we continue this problem and investigate the structure of X-decomposable non-perfect finite groups, for X = \{1, 2, 3 \}. We prove that such a group is isomorphic to Z_6, D_8, Q_8, S_4, SmallGroup(20, 3), SmallGroup(24, 3), where SmallGroup(m,n) denotes the mth group of order n in the small group library of GAP \cite{gap}.
