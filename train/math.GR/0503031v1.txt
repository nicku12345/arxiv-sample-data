Suppose G is an arbitrary additively written primary abelian group with a fixed large subgroup L. It is shown that G is (a) summable; (b) \sigma-summable;\break (c) a \Sigma-group; (d) p^{\omega+1}-projective only when so is L. These claims extend results of such a kind obtained by Benabdallah, Eisenstadt, Irwin and Poluianov, {\it Acta Math. Acad. Sci. Hungaricae} (1970) and Khan, {\it Proc. Indian Acad. Sci. Sect. A} (1978).
