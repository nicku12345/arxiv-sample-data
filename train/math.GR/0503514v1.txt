We set up a Grothendieck spectral sequence which generalizes the Lyndon--Hochschild--Serre spectral sequence for a group extension K\mono G\epi Q by allowing the normal subgroup K to be replaced by a subgroup, or family of subgroups which satisfy a weaker condition than normality. This is applied to establish a decomposition theorem for certain groups as fundamental groups of graphs of Poincar\'e duality groups. We further illustrate the method by proving a cohomological vanishing theorem which applies for example to Thompson's group F.
