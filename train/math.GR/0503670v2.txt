We discuss metric and combinatorial properties of Thompson's group T, including normal forms for elements and unique tree pair diagram representatives. We relate these properties to those of Thompson's group F when possible, and highlight combinatorial differences between the two groups. We define a set of unique normal forms for elements of T arising from minimal factorizations of elements into natural pieces. We show that the number of carets in a reduced representative of an element of T estimates the word length, and that F is undistorted in T. We describe how to recognize torsion elements in T.
