The object of this paper is to find a necessary and sufficient condition for the groups G_1, G_2, ..., G_n so that every normal subgroup of the product \prod_{i=1}^{n} G_i is of the type \prod_{i=1}^{n} N_i with N_i \trianglelefteq G_i, i=1,2, ..., n. As a consequence we obtain a well-known result due to R. Remak about centreless completely reducible groups having finitely many direct factors.
