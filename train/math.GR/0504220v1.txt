The Weyl integration model presented by An and Wang can be effectively used to reduce the integration over G-space. In this paper, we construct an especial Weyl integration model for KAK decomposition of Reductive Lie Group and obtain an integration formula which implies that the integration of L^1-integrable function over reductive Lie group G can be carried out by first integrating over each conjugacy class and then integrating over the set of conjugacy classes.
