In this paper we study non-abelian extensions of a Lie group G modeled on a locally convex space by a Lie group N. The equivalence classes of such extension are grouped into those corresponding to a class of so-called smooth outer actions S of G on N. If S is given, we show that the corresponding set \Ext(G,N)_S of extension classes is a principal homogeneous space of the locally smooth cohomology group H^2_{ss}(G,Z(N))_S. To each S a locally smooth obstruction class \chi(S) in a suitably defined cohomology group H^3_{ss}(G,Z(N))_S is defined. It vanishes if and only if there is a corresponding extension of G by N. A central point is that we reduce many problems concerning extensions by non-abelian groups to questions on extensions by abelian groups, which have been dealt with in previous work. An important tool is a Lie theoretic concept of a smooth crossed module \alpha : H \to G, which we view as a central extension of a normal subgroup of G.
