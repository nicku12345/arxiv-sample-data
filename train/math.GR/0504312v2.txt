We show that for any finite group G and for any d there exists a word w\in F_{d} such that a d-tuple in G satisfies w if and only if it generates a solvable subgroup. In particular, if G itself is not solvable, then it cannot be obtained as a quotient of the one relator group F_{d}/<w>.   As a corollary, the probability that a word is satisfied in a fixed non-solvable group can be made arbitrarily small, answering a question of Alon Amit.
