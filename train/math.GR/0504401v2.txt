The centrepiece of this paper is a normal form for primitive elements which facilitates the use of induction arguments to prove properties of primitive elements. The normal form arises from an elementary algorithm for constructing a primitive element p in F(x, y) with a given exponent sum pair (X, Y), if such an element p exists. Several results concerning the primitive elements of F(x, y) are recast as applications of the algorithm and the normal form.
