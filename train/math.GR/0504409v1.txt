Let V be an n-dimensional left vector space over a division ring R and n\ge 3. Denote by {\mathcal G}_{k} the Grassmann space of k-dimensional subspaces of V and put {\mathfrak G}_{k} for the set of all pairs (S,U)\in {\mathcal G}_{k}\times {\mathcal G}_{n-k} such that S+U=V. We study bijective transformations of {\mathfrak G}_{k} preserving the class of base subsets and show that these mappings are induced by semilinear isomorphisms of V to itself or to the dual space V^{*} if n\ne 2k; for n=2k this fails. This result can be formulated as the following: if n\ne 2k and the characteristic of R is not equal to 2 then any commutativity preserving transformation of the set of (k,n-k)-involutions is extended to an automorphism of the group {\rm GL}(V).
