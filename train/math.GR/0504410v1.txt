Let V be a 2n-dimensional vector space over a field F and \Omega be a non-degenerate symplectic form on V. Denote by {\mathfrak H}_{k}(\Omega) the set of all 2k-dimensional subspaces U\subset V such that the restriction \Omega|_{U} is non-degenerate. Our main result (Theorem 1) says that if n\ne 2k and \max(k,n-k)\ge 5 then any bijective transformation of {\mathfrak H}_{k}(\Omega) preserving the class of base subsets is induced by a semi-simplectic automorphism of V. For the case when n\ne 2k this fails, but we have a weak version of this result (Theorem 2). If the characteristic of F is not equal to 2 then there is a one-to-one correspondence between elements of {\mathfrak H}_{k}(\Omega) and symplectic (2k,2n-2k)-involutions and Theorem 1 can be formulated as follows: for the case when n\ne 2k and \max(k,n-k)\ge 5 any commutativity preserving bijective transformation of the set of symplectic (2k,2n-2k)-involutions can be extended to an automorphism of the symplectic group.
