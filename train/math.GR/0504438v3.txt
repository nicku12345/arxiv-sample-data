The following question was asked by V. V. Bludov in The Kourovka Notebook in 1995: If a torsion-free group G has a finite system of generators a_1, ..., a_n such that every element of G has a unique presentation in the form a_1^{k_1}... a_n^{k_n} where k_i\in\mathbb Z, is it true that G is virtually polycyclic? The answer is ``not always.'' A counterexample is constructed in this paper as a group presented by generators and defining relations.
