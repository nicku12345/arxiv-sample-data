It is relatively easy to construct a finitely generated group with infinite asymptotic dimension: the restricted wreath product of \mathbb{Z} by \mathbb{Z} provides an example. In light of this, it becomes interesting to consider the rate of growth of the asymptotic dimension function of a group. Loosely speaking, we measure the dimension on \lambda-scale and let \lambda increase to infinity to recover the asymptotic dimension. In this paper we consider how the asymptotic dimension function is affected by different constructions involving groups.
