We construct three groups \Lambda_1, \Lambda_2, \Lambda_3, which can all be decomposed as amalgamated products F_9 \ast_{F_{81}} F_{9} and have very few normal subgroups of finite or infinite index. Concretely, \Lambda_1 is a simple group, \Lambda_2 is not simple but has no non-trivial normal subgroup of infinite index, and \Lambda_3 is not simple but has no proper subgroup of finite index.
