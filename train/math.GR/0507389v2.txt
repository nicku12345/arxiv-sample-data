For each positive integer k we present an example of Coxeter system (G_k,S_k) such that G_k is a word-hyperbolic Coxeter group, for any two generating reflections s,t\in S_k the product st has finite order, and the Coxeter graph of S_k has negative inertia index equal to k. In particular, G_k cannot be embedded into pseudo-orthogonal group O(n,k-1) for any n as a reflection group with generating set being reflections w.r.t. (G_k,S_k)
