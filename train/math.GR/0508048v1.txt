Let G be a nilpotent group and a\in G. Let a^G=\{g^{-1}ag\mid g\in G\} be the conjugacy class of a in G. Assume that a^G and b^G are conjugacy classes of G with the property that |a^G|=|b^G|=p, where p is an odd prime number.   Set a^G b^G=\{xy\mid x\in a^G, y\in b^G\}. Then either a^G b^G=(ab)^G or a^G b^G is the union of at least \frac{p+1}{2} distinct conjugacy classes. As an application of the previous result, given any nilpotent group G and any conjugacy class a^G of size p, we describe the square a^G a^G of a^G in terms of conjugacy classes of G.
