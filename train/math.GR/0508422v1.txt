Let G be a group generated by a finite set A. An element g\in G is a strict dead end of depth k (with respect to A) if |g|>|ga_1|>|ga_1a_2|>...>|ga_1a_2... a_k| for any a_1,a_2, ..., a_k\in A^{\pm1} such that the word a_1a_2... a_k is freely irreducible. (Here |g| is the distance from g to the identity in the Cayley graph of G.) We show that in finitely generated free soluble groups of degree d\ge2 there exist strict dead elements of depth k=k(d), which grows exponentially with respect to d.
