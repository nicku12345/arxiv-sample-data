Let k(G) be the number of conjugacy classes of finite groups G and \pi_e(G) be the set of the orders of elements in G. Then there exists a non-negative integer k such that k(G)=|\pi_e(G)|+k. We call such groups to be co(k) groups. This paper classifies all finite co(1) groups. They are isomorphic to one of the following groups:   A_5, L_2(7), S_5, Z_3, Z_4, S_4, A_4, D_{10}, Hol(Z_5), or Z_3\rtimes Z_4.
