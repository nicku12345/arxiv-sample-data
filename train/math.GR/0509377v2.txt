Let M be a maximal subgroup of a finite group G and K/L be a chief factor such that L\leq M while K\nsubseteq M. We call the group M\cap K/L a c\ns section of M. And we define Sec(M) to be the abstract group that is isomorphic to a c\ns section of M. For every maximal subgroup M of G, assume that Sec(M) is supersolvable. Then any composition factor of G is isomorphic to L_2(p) or Z_q, where p and q are primes, and p\equiv\pm 1(mod 8). This result answer a question posed by ref. \cite{WL}.
