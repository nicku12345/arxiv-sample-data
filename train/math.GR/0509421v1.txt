Let H be a subgroup of a group G. We say that H satisfies the power condition with respect to G, or H is a power subgroup of G, if there exists a non-negative integer m such that H=G^{m}=<g^{m} | g \in G >. In this note, the following theorem is proved: Let G be a group and k the number of non-power subgroups of G. Then (1) k=0 if and only if G is a cyclic group(theorem of F. Sz\acute{a}sz) ;(2) 0 < k <\infty if and only if G is a finite non-cyclic group; (3) k=\infty if and only if G is a infinte non-cyclic group. Thus we get a new criterion for the finite non-cyclic groups.
