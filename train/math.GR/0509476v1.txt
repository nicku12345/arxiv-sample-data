The aim of this paper is to classify the finite nonsolvable groups in which every irreducible character of even degree vanishes on at most two conjugacy classes. As a corollary, it is shown that L_2(2^f) are the only nonsolvable groups in which every irreducible character of even degree vanishes on just one conjugacy class.
