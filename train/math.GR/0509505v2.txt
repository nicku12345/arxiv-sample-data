The spectrum \omega(G) of a finite group G is the set of element orders of G. If \Omega is a non-empty subset of the set of natural numbers, h(\Omega) stands for the number of isomorphism classes of finite groups G with \omega(G)=\Omega and put h(G)=h(\omega(G)). We say that G is recognizable (by spectrum \omega(G)) if h(G)=1. The group G is almost recognizable (resp. nonrecognizable) if 1<h(G)<\infty (resp. h(G)=\infty). In the present paper, we focus our attention on the projective general linear groups {PGL}(2,p^n), where p=2^\alpha 3^\beta+1 is a prime, \alpha \geq 0, \beta \geq 0 and n\geq 1, and we show that these groups cannot be almost recognizable, in other words h({PGL}(2,p^n))\in \{1, \infty\}. It is also shown that the projective general linear groups {PGL}(2,7) and {PGL}(2,9) are nonrecognizable. In this paper a computer program has also been presented in order to find out the primitive prime divisors of a^n-1.
