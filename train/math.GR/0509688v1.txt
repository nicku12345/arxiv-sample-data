For any odd prime p we consider representations of a group of order p in the symplectic group Sp(p-1,Z[1/n]) of (p-1)\times(p-1)-matrices over the ring Z[1/n], 0\neq n\in N. We construct a relation between the conjugacy classes of subgroups P of order p in the symplectic group and the ideal class group in the ring Z[1/n]. This is used for the study of these classes. In particular we determine the centralizer C(P) and N(P)/C(P) where N(P) denotes the normalizer.
