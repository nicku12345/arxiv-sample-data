We take a step towards the development of a nilpotency theory for loops based on the commutator-associator filtration instead of the lower central series. This nilpotency theory shares many essential features with the associative case. In particular, we show that the isolator of the nth commutator-associator subloop coincides with the nth dimension subloop over a field of characteristic zero.
