More than 70 years ago, P. Hall showed that if G is a finite p-group such that a term \der G{d+1} of the derived series is non-trivial, then the order of the quotient \der Gd/\der G{d+1} is at least p^{2^d+1}. Recently Mann proved that, in a finite p-group, Hall's lower bound can be taken for at most two distinct d. We improve this result and show that if p is odd, then it can only be taken for two distinct d in a group with order p^6.
