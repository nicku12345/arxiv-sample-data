In this paper, we show that the center of every Coxeter group is finite and isomorphic to (\Z_2)^n for some n\ge 0. Moreover, for a Coxeter system (W,S), we prove that Z(W)=Z(W_{S\setminus\tilde{S}}) and Z(W_{\tilde{S}})=1, where Z(W) is the center of the Coxeter group W and \tilde{S} is the subset of S such that the parabolic subgroup W_{\tilde{S}} is the {\it essential parabolic subgroup} of (W,S) (i.e.\ W_{\tilde{S}} is the minimum parabolic subgroup of finite index in (W,S)). The finiteness of the center of a Coxeter group implies that a splitting theorem holds for Coxeter groups.
