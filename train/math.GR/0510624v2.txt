We study the structure of nilpotent subsemigroups in the semigroup M(n,\mathbb{F}) of all n\times n matrices over a field, \mathbb{F}, with respect to the operation of the usual matrix multiplication. We describe the maximal subsemigroups among the nilpotent subsemigroups of a fixed nilpotency degree and classify them up to isomorphism. We also describe isolated and completely isolated subsemigroups and conjugated elements in M(n,\mathbb{F}).
