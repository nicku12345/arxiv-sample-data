We study the algebraic properties of the series \mathrm{K}_n of semigroups, which is inspired by \cite{Ki} and has origins in convexity theory. In particular, we describe Green's relations on \mathrm{K}_n, prove that there exists a faithful representation of \mathrm{K}_n by n\times n matrices with non-negative integer coefficients (and even explicitly construct such a representation), and prove that \mathrm{K}_n does not admit a faithful representation by matrices of smaller size. We also describe the maximal nilpotent subsemigroups in \mathrm{K}_n, all isolated and completely isolated subsemigroups, all automorphisms and anti-automorphisms of \mathrm{K}_n. Finally, we explicitly construct all irreducible representations of \mathrm{K}_n over any field and describe primitive idempotents in the semigroup algebra (which we prove is basic).
