Let n>0 be an integer and \mathcal{X} be a class of groups.   We say that a group G satisfies the condition (\mathcal{X},n) whenever in every subset with n+1 elements of G there exist distinct elements x,y such that <x,y> is in \mathcal{X}. Let \mathcal{N} and  \mathcal{A} be the classes of nilpotent groups and abelian groups, respectively. Here we prove that: (1) If G is a finite semi-simple group satisfying the condition (\mathcal{N},n), then |G|<c^{2[\log_{21}n]n^2} [\log_{21}n]!, for some constant c. (2) A finite insoluble group G satisfies the condition (\mathcal{N},21) if and only if \frac{G}{Z^*(G)}\cong A_5, the alternating group of degree 5, where Z^*(G) is the hypercentre of G. (3) A finite non-nilpotent group G satisfies the condition (\mathcal{N}, 4) if and only if \frac{G}{Z^*(G)}\cong S_3, the symmetric group of degree 3. (4) An insoluble group G satisfies the condition (\mathcal{A},21) if and only if G\cong Z(G)\times A_5, where Z(G) is the centre of G. (5) If d is the derived length of a soluble group satisfying the condition (\mathcal{A},n), then d=1 if n\in \{1,2\} and d\leq 2n-3 if n\geq 2.
