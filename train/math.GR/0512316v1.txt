The concept of `topological right transversal' is introduced to study right transversals in topological groups. Given any right quasigroup S with a Tychonoff topology T, it is proved that there exists a Hausdorff topological group in which S can be embedded algebraically and topologically as a right transversal of a subgroup (not necessarily closed). It is also proved that if a topological right transversal (S, T_{S}, T^{S}, \circ) is such that T_{S} = T^{S} is a locally compact Hausdorff topology on S, then S can be embedded as a right transversal of a closed subgroup in a Hausdorff topological group which is universal in some sense.
