Juhasz has proved that the automorphism group of a group G of maximal class of order p^n, with p\ge 5 and n>p+1, has order divisible by p^{\lceil(3n-2p+5)/2\rceil}. We show that by translating the problem in terms of derivations, the result can be deduced from the case where G is metabelian. Here one can use a general result of Caranti and Scoppola concerning automorphisms of two-generator, nilpotent metabelian groups.
