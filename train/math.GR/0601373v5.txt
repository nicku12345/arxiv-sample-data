Let G be a connected reductive algebraic group defined over an algebraic closure of a finite field and let F : G \to G be an endomorphism such that F^d is a Frobenius endomorphism for some d \geq 1. Let P be a parabolic subgroup of G admitting an F-stable Levi subgroup. We prove that the Deligne-Lusztig variety \{gP | g^{-1}F(g)\in P\cdot F(P)\} is irreducible if and only if P is not contained in a proper F-stable parabolic subgroup of G.
