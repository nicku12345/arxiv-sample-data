In the process of computing the Galois group of a prime degree polynomial f(x) over \mathbb Q we suggest a preliminary checking for the existence of non-real roots. If f(x) has non-real roots, then combining a 1871 result of Jordan and the classification of transitive groups of prime degree which follows from CFSG we get that the Galois group of f(x) contains A_p or is one of a short list. Let f(x)\in \mathbb Q [x]  be an irreducible polynomial of prime degree p \geq 5 and r=2s be the number of non-real roots of f(x). We show that if s satisfies s (s \log s + 2 \log s + 3) \leq p  then Gal (f)= A_p, S_p.
