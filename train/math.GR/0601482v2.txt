The principal objects studied in this note are Coxeter groups W that are neither finite nor affine. A well known result of de la Harpe asserts that such groups have exponential growth. We consider quotients of W by its parabolic subgroups and by a certain class of reflection subgroups. We show that these quotients have exponential growth as well. To achieve this, we use a theorem of Dyer to construct a reflection subgroup of W that is isomorphic to the universal Coxeter group on three generators. The results are all proved under the restriction that the Coxeter diagram of W is simply laced, and some remarks made on how this restriction may be relaxed.
