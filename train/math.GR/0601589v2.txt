We first give a short group theoretic proof of the following result of Lackenby. If G is a large group, H is a finite index subgroup of G admitting an epimorphism onto a non--cyclic free group, and g is an element of H, then the quotient of G by the normal subgroup generated by g^n is large for all but finitely many n\in \mathbb Z. In the second part of this note we use similar methods to show that for every infinite sequence of primes (p_1, p_2, ...), there exists an infinite finitely generated periodic group Q with descending normal series Q=Q_0\rhd Q_1\rhd ... , such that \bigcap_i Q_i=\{1\}  and Q_{i-1}/Q_i is either trivial or abelian of exponent p_i.
