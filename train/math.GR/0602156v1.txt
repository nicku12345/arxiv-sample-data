In the paper we complete the classification of Carter subgroups in finite almost simple groups. In particular, we prove that Carter subgroups of every finite almost simple group are conjugate. Togeather with previous results by author and F. Dalla Volta, A. Lucchini, and M. C. Tamburini, as a corollary, it follows that Carter subgroups of every finite group are conjugate.
