Let \phi be an automorphism of a free group F_n of rank n, and let M_{\phi}=F_n \rtimes_{\phi} \mathbb{Z} be the corresponding mapping torus of \phi. We study the group Out(M_{\phi}) under certain technical conditions on \phi. Moreover, in the case of rank 2, we classify the cases when this group is finite or virtually cyclic, depending on the conjugacy class of the image of \phi in GL_2(\mathbb{Z}).
