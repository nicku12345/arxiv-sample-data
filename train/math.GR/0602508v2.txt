Every nonabelian finite simple group of rank n over a field of size q, with the possible exception of the Ree groups ^2G_2(3^{2e+1}), has a presentation with a bounded number of generators and relations and total length O(\log n +\log q). As a corollary, we deduce a conjecture of Holt: there is a constant C such that \dim H^2(G,M)\leq C\dim M for every finite simple group G, every prime p and every irreducible F_p [G]-module M.
