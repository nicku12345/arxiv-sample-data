We introduce two generalisations of the full symmetric inverse semigroup {\mathcal{I}}_X and its dual semigroup {\mathcal{I}^{\ast}}_X -- inverse semigroups {\mathcal{PI}^{\ast}}_X and {\overline{\mathcal{PI}^{\ast}}}_X. Both of them have the same carrier and contain \IS_X. Binary operations on {\mathcal{PI}^{\ast}}_X and {\overline{\mathcal{PI}^{\ast}}}_X are reminiscent of the multiplication in {\mathcal{I}}_X. We use a convenient geometric way to realise elements from these two semigroups. This enables us to study efficiently their inner properties and to compare them with the corresponding properties of \IS_X and {\mathcal{I}^{\ast}}_X.
