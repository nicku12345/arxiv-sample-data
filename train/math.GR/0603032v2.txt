It is shown that certain ascending HNN extensions of free abelian groups of finite rank, as well as various lamplighter groups, can be realized as automaton groups, i.e., can be given a self-similar structure. This includes the solvable Baumslag-Solitar groups BS(1,m), for m not +/-1.   In addition, it is shown that, for any relatively prime integers m,n>=2, the pair of Baumslag-Solitar groups BS(1,m) and BS(1,n) can be realized by a pair of dual automata. The examples are then used to illustrate more general connections between Schreier graphs, composition of automata and dual automata.
