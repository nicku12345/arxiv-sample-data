Filling functions are asymptotic invariants of finitely presentable groups; the seminal work on the subject is by M.Gromov. They record features of combinatorial homotopy discs (van Kampen diagrams) filling loops in Cayley 2-complexes. Examples are the Dehn (or isoperimetric) function, the filling length function and the intrinsic diameter (or isodiametric) function. We discuss filling functions from geometric, combinatorial and computational points of view, we survey their interrelationships, and we sketch their roles in the studies of nilpotent groups, hyperbolic groups and asymptotic cones. Many open questions are included.   This is a set of notes for a workshop on "The Geometry of the Word Problem" at the Centre de Recerca Matematica, Barcelona in July 2005. It will be part of a Birkhauser-Verlag volume in the "Advanced Courses in Mathematics CRM Barcelona" series.
