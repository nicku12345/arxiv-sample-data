We describe pure braided versions of Thompson's group F. These groups, BF and \hat{BF}, are subgroups of the braided versions of Thompson's group V, introduced by Brin and Dehornoy. Unlike V, elements of F are order-preserving self-maps of the interval and we use pure braids together with elements of F thus preserving order. We define these groups and give normal forms for elements and describe infinite and finite presentations of these groups.
