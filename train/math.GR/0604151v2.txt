Let \Gamma be a group which is virtually free of rank at least 2 and let \mathcal{F}_{td}(\Gamma) be the family of totally disconnected, locally compact groups containing \Gamma as a co-compact lattice.   We prove that the values of the scale function with respect to groups in \mathcal{F}_{td}(\Gamma) evaluated on the subset \Gamma have only finitely many prime divisors. This can be thought of as a uniform property of the family \mathcal{F}_{td}(\Gamma).
