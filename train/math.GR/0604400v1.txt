We prove two results. (1) There is an absolute constant D such that for any finite quasisimple group S, given 2D arbitrary automorphisms of S, every element of S is equal to a product of D `twisted commutators' defined by the given automorphisms.   (2) Given a natural number q, there exist C=C(q) and M=M(q) such that: if S is a finite quasisimple group with | S/\mathrm{Z}(S)| >C, \beta_{j}  (j=1,...,M) are any automorphisms of S, and q_{j}  (j=1,...,M) are any divisors of q, then there exist inner automorphisms \alpha_{j} of S such that S=\prod_{1}^{M}[S,(\alpha_{j}\beta_{j})^{q_{j}}].   These results, which rely on the Classification of finite simple groups, are needed to complete the proofs of the main theorems of Part I.
