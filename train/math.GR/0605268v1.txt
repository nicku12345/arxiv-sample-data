In this paper we construct a gathering process by the means of which we obtain new normal forms in braid groups. The new normal forms generalise Artin-Markoff normal forms and possess an extremely natural geometric description. In the two last sections of the paper we discuss the implementation of the introduced gathering process and the questions that arose in our work. This discussion leads us to some interesting observations, in particular, we offer a method of generating a random braid.
