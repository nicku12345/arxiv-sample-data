Let \Out(F_n) denote the outer automorphism group of the free group F_n with n>3. We prove that for any finite index subgroup \Gamma<\Out(F_n), the group \Aut(\Gamma) is isomorphic to the normalizer of \Gamma in \Out(F_n). We prove that \Gamma is {\em co-Hopfian} : every injective homomorphism \Gamma\to \Gamma is surjective. Finally, we prove that the abstract commensurator \Comm(\Out(F_n)) is isomorphic to \Out(F_n).
