In this note I describe the structure of the biset functor B^\times sending a p-group P to the group of units of its Burnside ring B(P). In particular, I show that B^\times is a rational biset functor. It follows that if P is a p-group, the structure of B^\times(P) can be read from a genetic basis of P: the group B^\times(P) is an elementary abelian 2-group of rank equal to the number isomorphism classes of rational irreducible representations of P whose type is trivial, cyclic of order 2, or dihedral.
