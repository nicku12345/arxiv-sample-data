We prove that Ad-semisimple conjugacy classes in a connected Lie group G are closed embedded submanifolds of G. We also prove that if \alpha:H\to G is a homomorphism of connected Lie groups such that the kernel of \alpha is discrete in H, then for an Ad-semisimple conjugacy class C in G, every connected component of \alpha^{-1}(C) is a conjugacy class in H. Corresponding results for adjoint orbits in real Lie algebras are also proved.
