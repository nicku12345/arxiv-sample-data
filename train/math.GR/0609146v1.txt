Recently Alonso and Hermiller introduced a homological finiteness condition\break bi{-}FP_n (here called {\it weak} bi{-}FP_n) for monoid rings, and Kobayashi and Otto introduced a different property, also called bi{-}FP_n (we adhere to their terminology). From these and other papers we know that: bi{-}FP_n \Rightarrow left and right FP_n \Rightarrow weak bi{-}FP_n; the first implication is not reversible in general; the second implication is reversible for group rings. We show that the second implication is reversible in general, even for arbitrary associative algebras (Theorem 1'), and we show that the first implication {\it is} reversible for group rings (Theorem 2). We also show that the all four properties are equivalent for connected graded algebras (Theorem 4). A result on retractions (Theorem 3') is proved, and some questions are raised.
