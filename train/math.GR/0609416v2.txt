This paper is the first of a sequence of three papers, where the concept of an \mathbb R-tree dual to a measured geodesic lamination in a hyperbolic surface is generalized to arbitrary \mathbb R-trees provided with a (very small) action of the free group F_N of finite rank N\geq 2 by isometries. Three different definitions are given and they are proved to be equivalent. We also describe the topology and Out(F_N)-action on the space of laminations.
