Two G-sets (G a finite group) are called linearly equivalent over a commutative ring k if the permutation representations k[X] and k[Y] are isomorphic as modules over the group algebra kG. Pairs of linearly equivalent non-isomorphic G-sets have applications in number theory and geometry. We characterize the groups G for which such pairs exist for any field, and give a simple construction of these pairs. If k is \Q, these are precisely the non-cyclic groups. For any non-cyclic group, we prove that there exist G-sets which are non-isomorphic and \lineq over \Q, of cardinality \leq 3(#G)/2.   Also, we investigate a construction of P. Beaulieu which allows us to construct pairs of transitive linearly equivalent S_n-sets from arbitrary G-sets for an arbitrary group G. We show that this construction works over all fields and use it construct, for each finite set \mc P of primes, S_n-sets linearly equivalent over a field k if and only if the characteristic of k lies in \mc P.
