This survey on the automorphism groups of finite p-groups focuses on three major topics: explicit computations for familiar finite p-groups, such as the extraspecial p-groups and Sylow p-subgroups of Chevalley groups; constructing p-groups with specified automorphism groups; and the discovery of finite p-groups whose automorphism groups are or are not p-groups themselves. The material is presented with varying levels of detail, with some of the examples given in complete detail.
