Let X be a proper CAT(0) space. A halfspace system (or cubulation) of X is a set H of open halfspaces closed under closure-complementation and such that every point in X has a neighbourhood intersecting only finitely many walls of H. Given a cubulation H, one uses the Sageev-Roller construction to form a cubing C(H).   One setting in which cubulations were studied is that of a Coxeter group (W,R) acting on its Davis-Moussong complex, with elements of H being the halfspaces defined by reflections. For this setting, Niblo and Reeves had shown that C(H) is a finite-dimensional, locally-finite cubing. Their proof explicitly uses the `parallel walls property' of Coxeter groups, proved by Brink and Howlett, and heavily relies on meticulous calculations with the root system associated with (W,R).   We generalize their local finiteness result using the visual boundary of X, endowed with the cone topology. We introduce an asymptotic condition on H (`uniformness'), and show it is equivalent to H having the parallel walls property together with boundedness of chambers. Uniformness regards the way in which boundary points are approximated by the walls of H. We prove that if G is a group acting geometrically on a CAT(0) space X and H is a uniform cubulation of X invariant under G, then C(H) is locally-finite. We also show that the obvious map of X into C(H) is a quasi-isometry, and use this to give quantitative results strengthening the parallel walls property.
