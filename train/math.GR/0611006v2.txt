In this work we introduce a new combinatorial notion of boundary \Re C of an \omega-dimensional cubing C. \Re C is defined to be the set of almost-equality classes of ultrafilters on the standard system of halfspaces of C, endowed with an order relation reflecting the interaction between the Tychonoff closures of the classes.   When C arises as the dual of a cubulation -- or discrete system of halfspaces -- \HH of a CAT(0) space X (for example, the Niblo-Reeves cubulation of the Davis-Moussong complex of a finite rank Coxeter group), we show how \HH induces a function \rho:\bd X\to\Re C. We develop a notion of uniformness for \HH, generalizing the parallel walls property enjoyed by Coxeter groups, and show that, if the pair (X,\HH) admits a geometric action by a group G, then the fibers of \rho form a stratification of \bd X graded by the order structure of \Re C. We also show how this structure computes the components of the Tits boundary of X.   Finally, using our result from another paper, that the uniformness of a cubulation as above implies the local finiteness of C, we give a condition for the co-compactness of the action of G on C in terms of \rho, generalizing a result of Williams, previously known only for Coxeter groups.
