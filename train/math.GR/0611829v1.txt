We show that for any finitely generated group of matrices that is not virtually solvable, there is an integer m such that, given an arbitrary finite generating set for the group, one may find two elements a and b that are both products of at most m generators, such that a and b are free generators of a free subgroup. This uniformity result improves the original statement of the Tits alternative.
