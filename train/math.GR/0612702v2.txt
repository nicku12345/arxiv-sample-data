Our goal is to find dynamic invariants that completely determine elements of the outer automorphism group \Out(F_n) of the free group F_n of rank n. To avoid finite order phenomena, we do this for {\it forward rotationless} elements. This is not a serious restriction. For example, there is K_n>0 depending only on n such that, for all \phi\in\Out(F_n), \phi^{K_n} is forward rotationless. An important part of our analysis is to show that rotationless elements are represented by particularly nice relative train track maps.
