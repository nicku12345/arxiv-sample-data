A criterion for the HNN-extension of a finite p-group to be residually a finite p-group is obtained and based on this criterion the sufficient condition for residuality a finite p-group of HNN-extension with arbitrary base group is proved. Then these results are applied to give for groups from two classes of one-relator groups the necessary and sufficient condition to be residually a finite p-group.
