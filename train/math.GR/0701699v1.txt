Let M^*(q) be the unique nonassociative finite simple Moufang loop constructed over GF(q). We prove that Aut(M^*(2)) is the Chevalley group G_2(2), by extending multiplicative automorphism of M^*(2) into linear automorphisms of the unique split octonion algebra over GF(2). Many of our auxiliary results apply in the general case. In the course of the proof we show that every element of a split octonion algebra can be written as a sum of two elements of norm one.
