Let F be a perfect field and M^*(F) the nonassociative simple Moufang loop consisting of the units in the (unique) split octonion algebra O(F) modulo the center. Then Aut(M^*(F)) is equal to G_2(F) \rtimes Aut(F). In particular, every automorphism of M^*(F) is induced by a semilinear automorphism of O(F). The proof combines results and methods from geometrical loop theory, groups of Lie type and composition algebras; its gist being an identification of the automorphism group of a Moufang loop with a subgroup of the automorphism group of the associated group with triality.
