The probability that m randomly chosen elements of a finite power associative loop C have prescribed orders and generate C is calculated in terms of certain constants related to the action of Aut(C) on the subloop lattice of C. As an illustration, all meaningful probabilities of random generation by elements of given orders are found for the smallest nonassociative simple Moufang loop.
