Let G be a finite group and C_2 the cyclic group of order 2. Consider the 8 multiplicative operations (x,y)\mapsto (x^iy^j)^k, where i, j, k\in\{-1, 1\}. Define a new multiplication on G\times C_2 by assigning one of the above 8 multiplications to each quarter (G\times\{i\})\times(G\times\{j\}), for i, j\in C_2. When G is nonabelian then exactly four assignments yield Moufang loops that are not associative; all (anti)isomorphic, known as loops M(G,2).
