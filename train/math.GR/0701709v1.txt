Let G be a finite group and C_2 the cyclic group of order 2. Consider the 8 multiplicative operations (x,y)\mapsto (x^iy^j)^k, where i, j, k\in\{-1, 1\}. Define a new multiplication on G\times C_2 by assigning one of the above 8 multiplications to each quarter (G\times\{i\})\times(G\times\{j\}), for i, j\in C_2. We describe all situations in which the resulting quasigroup is a Bol loop. This paper also corrects an error in P. Vojt\v{e}chovsk\'y: On the uniqueness of loops M(G,2).
