A quasigroup identity is of Bol-Moufang type if two of its three variables occur once on each side, the third variable occurs twice on each side, the order in which the variables appear on both sides is the same, and the only binary operation used is the multiplication, viz. ((xy)x)z=x(y(xz)). Many well-known varieties of quasigroups are of Bol-Moufang type. We show that there are exactly 26 such varieties, determine all inclusions between them, and provide all necessary counterexamples. We also determine which of these varieties consist of loops or one-sided loops, and fully describe the varieties of commutative quasigroups of Bol-Moufang type. Some of the proofs are computer-generated.
