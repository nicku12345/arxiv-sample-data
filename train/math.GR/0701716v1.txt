The variety of quasigroups satisfying the identity (xy)(zy)=xz mirrors the variety of groups, and offers a new look at groups and their multiplication tables. Such quasigroups are constructed from a group using right division instead of multiplication. Their multiplication tables consist of circulant blocks which have additional symmetries and have a concise presentation.   These tables are a reincarnation of the group matrices which Frobenius used to give the first account of group representation theory. Our results imply that every group matrix may be written as a block circulant matrix and that this result leads to partial diagonalization of group matrices, which are present in modern applied mathematics. We also discuss right division in loops with the antiautomorphic inverse property.
