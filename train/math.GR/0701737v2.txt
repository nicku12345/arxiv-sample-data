We address the following question. For which finitely generated pro-p groups the comparison map \phi^2:H_{cont}^{2}(P,\F_p) \to H_{disc}{2}(P,\F_p) is an isomorphism? We prove that if P is not finitely presented then \phi^2 is not surjective. Furthermore, if P is finitely presented \phi^2 is an isomorphism if and only if the comparison map \phi_2:H^{disc}_{2}(P, \F_p) \to H^{cont}_{2}(P, \F_p) of second homology groups is an isomorphism. This is the content of Theorem A.   The second main result of the paper is Theorem B, which gives an explicit construction of a cochain from the kernel of \phi^2.
