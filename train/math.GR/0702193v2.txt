Let G be a simple algebraic group over an algebraically closed field with Lie algebra g. Then the orbits of nilpotent elements of g under the adjoint action of G have been classified. We describe a simple algorithm for finding a representative of a nilpotent orbit. We use this to compute lists of representatives of these orbits for the Lie algebras of exceptional type. Then we give two applications. The first one concerns settling a conjecture by Elashvili on the index of centralizers of nilpotent orbits, for the case where the Lie algebra is of exceptional type. The second deals with minimal dimensions of double centralizers.
