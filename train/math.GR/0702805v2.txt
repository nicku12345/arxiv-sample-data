The Horizontal Chord Theorem states that if a continuous curve connects points A and B in the plane, then for any integer k there are points C and D on the curve such that \overrightarrow{AB}=k \overrightarrow{CD}. In this note, we discuss a few combinatorial-analysis problems related to this theorem and introduce a different formulation that gives way to generalizations on graphs.
