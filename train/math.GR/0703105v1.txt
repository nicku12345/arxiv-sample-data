We provide lower estimates on the minimal number of generators of the profinite completion of free products of finite groups. In particular, we show that if C_1,...,C_n are finite cyclic groups then there exists a finite group G which is generated by isomorphic copies of C_1,...,C_n and the minimal number of generators of G is n.
