Let (W, S) be a Coxeter system. We give necessary and sufficient conditions on the Coxeter diagram of (W, S) for W to be relatively hyperbolic with respect to a collection of finitely generated subgroups. The peripheral subgroups are necessarily parabolic subgroups (in the sense of Coxeter group theory). As an application, we present a criterion for the maximal flats of the Davis complex of (W,S) to be isolated. If this is the case, then the maximal affine sub-buildings of any building of type (W,S) are isolated.
