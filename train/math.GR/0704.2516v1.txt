A finite group G is of central type (in the non-classical sense) if it admits a non-degenerate cohomology class [c]\in H^2(G,\C^*) (G acts trivially on \C^*). Groups of central type play a fundamental role in the classification of semisimple triangular complex Hopf algebras and can be determined by their representation theoretical properties.   Suppose that a finite group Q acts on an abelian group A so that there exists a bijective 1-cocycle \pi\in Z^1(Q,\ach), where \ach=\rm{Hom}(A,\C^*) is endowed with the diagonal Q-action. Under this assumption, Etingof and Gelaki gave an explicit formula for a non-degenerate 2-cocycle in Z^2(G,\C^*), where G:=A\rtimes Q. Hence, the semidirect product G is of central type.   In this paper we present a more general correspondence between bijective and non-degenerate cohomology classes. In particular, given a bijective class [\pi]\in H^1(Q,\ach) as above, we construct non-degenerate classes [c_{\pi}]\in H^2(G,\C^*) for certain extensions 1\to A\to G\to Q\to 1 which are not necessarily split. We thus strictly extend the above family of central type groups.
