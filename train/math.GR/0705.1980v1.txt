Let X be a locally compact Hadamard space and G be a totally disconnected group acting continuously, properly and cocompactly on X. We show that a closed subgroup of G is amenable if and only if it is (topologically locally finite)-by-(virtually abelian). We are led to consider a set \bdfine X which is a refinement of the visual boundary \bd X. For each x \in \bdfine X, the stabilizer G_x is amenable.
