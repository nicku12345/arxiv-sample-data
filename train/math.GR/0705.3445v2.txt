A commutative loop is Jordan if it satisfies the identity x^2 (y x) = (x^2 y) x. Using an amalgam construction and its generalizations, we prove that a nonassociative Jordan loop of order n exists if and only if n\geq 6 and n\neq 9. We also consider whether powers of elements in Jordan loops are well-defined, and we construct an infinite family of finite simple nonassociative Jordan loops.
