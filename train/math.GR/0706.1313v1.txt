We continue in this article the study of laminations dual to very small actions of a free group F on R-trees. We prove that this lamination determines completely the combinatorial structure of the R-tree (the so-called observers' topology). On the contrary the metric is not determined by the lamination, and an R-tree may be equipped with different metrics which have the same observers' topology.
