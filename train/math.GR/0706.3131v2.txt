The main part of this paper contains a description of a nilpotent quotient algorithm for L-presented groups and a report on applications of its implementation in the computer algebra system GAP. The appendix introduces two new infinite series of L-presented groups. Apart from being of interest in their own right, these new L-presented groups serve as examples for applications of the nilpotent quotient algorithm.
