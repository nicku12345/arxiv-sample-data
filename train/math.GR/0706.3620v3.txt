Let K be a commutative hypergroup and \alpha\in \hat{K}. We show that K is \alpha-amenable with the unique \alpha-mean m_\alpha if and only if m_\alpha\in L^1(K)\cap L^2(K) and \alpha is isolated in \hat{K}. In contrast to the case of amenable noncompact locally compact groups, examples of polynomial hypergroups with unique \alpha-means (\alpha\not=1) are given. Further examples emphasize that the \alpha-amenability of hypergroups depends heavily on the asymptotic behavior of Haar measures and characters.
