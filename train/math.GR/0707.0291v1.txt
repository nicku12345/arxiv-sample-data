Let G be a group which is the semidirect product of a normal subgroup N and a subgroup T, and let M be a G-module with not necessarily trivial G-action. Then we embed the simultaneous restriction map res=(res^G_N,res^G_T)^t : H^2(G,M) \to H^2(N,M)^T \times H^2(T,M) into a natural five term exact sequence consisting of one and two-dimensional cohomology groups of the factors N and T. The elements of H^2(G,M) are represented in terms of group extensions of G by M constructed from extensions of N and T.
