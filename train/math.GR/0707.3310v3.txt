Results are obtained concerning the roots of asymmetric geometric representations of Coxeter groups. These representations were independently introduced by Vinberg and Eriksson, and generalize the standard geometric representation of a Coxeter group in such a way as to include all Kac--Moody Weyl groups. In particular, a characterization of when a non-trivial multiple of a root may also be a root is given in the general context. Characterizations of when the number of such multiples of a root is finite and when the number of positive roots sent to negative roots by a group element is finite are also given. These characterizations are stated in terms of combinatorial conditions on a graph closely related to the Coxeter graph for the group. Other finiteness results for the symmetric case which are connected to the Tits cone and to a natural partial order on positive roots are extended to this asymmetric setting.
