Let G be a finite p-group, for some prime p, and \psi, \theta \in \Irr(G) be irreducible complex characters of G. It has been proved that if, in addition, \psi,\theta are faithful characters, then the product \psi\theta is a multiple of an irreducible or it is the nontrivial linear combination of at least \frac{p+1}{2} distinct irreducible characters of G. We show that if we do not require the characters to be faithful, then given any integer k>0, we can always find a p-group G and irreducible characters \Psi and \Theta such that \Psi\Theta is the nontrivial combination of exactly k distinct irreducible characters. We do this by translating examples of decompositions of restrictions of characters into decompositions of products of characters.
