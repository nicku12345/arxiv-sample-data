Consider two free measure preserving group actions \Gamma \actson (X, \mu), \Delta \actson (X, \mu), and a measure preserving action \Delta \actson^a (Z, \nu) where (X, \mu), (Z, \nu) are standard probability spaces. We show how to construct free measure preserving actions \Gamma \actson^c (Y, m), \Delta \actson^d (Y, m) on a standard probability space such that E_{\Delta}^d \subset E_{\Gamma}^c and d has a as a factor. This generalizes the standard notion of co-induction of actions of groups from actions of subgroups. We then use this construction to show that if \Gamma is a countable non-amenable group, then \Gamma admits continuum many orbit inequivalent free, measure preserving, ergodic actions on a standard probability space.
