Let S_n be the symmetric group on n-letters. Fix n>5. Given any nontrivial \alpha,\beta\in S_n, we prove that the product \alpha^{S_n}\beta^{S_n} of the conjugacy classes \alpha^{S_n} and \beta^{S_n} is never a conjugacy class. Furthermore, if n is not even and n is not a multiple of three, then \alpha^{S_n}\beta^{S_n} is the union of at least three distinct conjugacy classes. We also describe the elements \alpha,\beta\in S_n in the case when \alpha^{S_n}\beta^{S_n} is the union of exactly two distinct conjugacy classes.
