For n \geq 2 let \Delta be a Dynkin diagram of rank n and let I = {1, >..., n} be the set of labels of \Delta. A group G admits a weak Phan system of type \Delta over \mathbb{C} if G is generated by subgroups U_i, i \in I, which are central quotients of simply connected compact semisimple Lie groups of rank one, and contains subgroups U_{i,j} = \gen{U_i ,U_j}, i \neq j \in I, which are central quotients of simply connected compact semisimple Lie groups of rank two such that U_i and U_j are rank one subgroups of U_{i,j} corresponding to a choice of a maximal torus and a fundamental system of roots for U_{i,j}. It is shown in this article that G then is a central quotient of the simply connected compact semisimple Lie group whose complexification is the simply connected complex semisimple Lie group of type \Delta.
