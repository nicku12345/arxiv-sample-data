We consider the capability of p-groups of class two and odd prime exponent. The question of capability is shown to be equivalent to a statement about vector spaces and linear transformations, and using the equivalence we give proofs of some old results and several new ones. In particular, we establish a number of new necessary and new sufficient conditions for capability, including a sufficient condition based only on the ranks of G/Z(G) and [G,G]. Finally, we characterise the capable groups among the 5-generated groups in this class.
