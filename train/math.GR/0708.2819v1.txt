Let G be a free product of two groups with amalgamated subgroup, \pi be either the set of all prime numbers or the one-element set \{p\} for some prime number p. Denote by \Sigma the family of all cyclic subgroups of group G, which are separable in the class of all finite \pi-groups. Obviously, cyclic subgroups of the free factors, which aren't separable in these factors by the family of all normal subgroups of finite \pi-index of group G, the subgroups conjugated with them and all subgroups, which aren't \pi^{\prime}-isolated, don't belong to \Sigma. Some sufficient conditions are obtained for \Sigma to coincide with the family of all other \pi^{\prime}-isolated cyclic subgroups of group G. It is proved, in particular, that the residual p-finiteness of a free product with cyclic amalgamation implies the p-separability of all p^{\prime}-isolated cyclic subgroups if the free factors are free or finitely generated residually p-finite nilpotent groups.
