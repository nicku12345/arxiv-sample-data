We classify minimal transitive subsemigroups of the finitary inverse symmetric semigroup modulo the classification of minimal transitive subgroups of finite symmetric groups; and semitransitive subsemigroups of the finite inverse symmetric semigroup of the minimal cardinality modulo the classification of transitive subgroups of the minimal cardinality of finite symmetric groups.
