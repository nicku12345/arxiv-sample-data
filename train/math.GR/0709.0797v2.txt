We establish that, given \Sigma a compact orientable surface, and G a finitely presented one-ended group, the set of copies of G in the mapping class group \mathcal{MCG}(\Sigma) consisting of only pseudo-anosov elements except identity, is finite up to conjugacy. This relies on a result of Bowditch on the same problem for images of surfaces groups. He asked us whether we could reduce the case of one-ended groups to his result ; this is a positive answer. Our work involves analogues of Rips and Sela canonical cylinders in curve complexes, and the argument of Delzant to bound the number of images of a one-ended group in a hyperbolic group.
