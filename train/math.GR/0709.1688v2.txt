All groups have 2 generators. For every prime power q, the Generalized Burnside Theorem (Theorem GB) produces an infinite number of solvable groups, Some, such as groups of a prime power exponent, have only elements of finite order and are therefore finite groups. Others have elements of infinite order and are thus infinite groups.   All these groups, even when infinite, are closely related to groups of exponent q. They have at least one generator of order q, and their commutator subgroup has exponent q.
