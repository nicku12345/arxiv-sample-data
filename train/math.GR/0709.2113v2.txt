For relatively hyperbolic groups, we investigate conditions guaranteeing that the subgroup generated by two quasiconvex subgroups Q and R is quasiconvex and isomorphic to Q \ast_{Q\cap R} R. Our results generalized known combination theorems for quasiconvex subgroups of word-hyperbolic groups. Some applications are presented.
