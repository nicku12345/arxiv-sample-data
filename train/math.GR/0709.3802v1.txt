We construct a CAT(0) group containing a finitely presented subgroup with infinitely many conjugacy classes of finite-order elements. Unlike previous examples (which were based on right-angled Artin groups) our ambient CAT(0) group does not contain any rank 3 free abelian subgroups.   We also construct examples of groups of type F_n inside mapping class groups, Aut(F), and Out(F) which have infinitely many conjugacy classes of finite-order elements.
