In this paper we give an infinite class of finite simple right Bol loops of exponent 2. The right multiplication group of these loops is an extension of an elementary Abelian 2-group by S_5. The construction uses the description of the structure of such loops given by M. Aschbacher. These results answer some questions of M. Aschbacher.
