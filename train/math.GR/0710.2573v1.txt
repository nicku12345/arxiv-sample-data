We study the automorphisms of a graph product of finitely-generated abelian groups W. More precisely, we study a natural subgroup Aut* W of Aut W, with Aut* W = Aut W whenever vertex groups are finite and in a number of other cases. We prove a number of structure results, including a semi-direct product decomposition of Aut* W in which one of the factors is Inn W. We also give a number of applications, some of which are geometric in nature.
