We prove that a finitely generated soluble residually finite group has polynomial index growth if and only if it is a minimax group. We also show that if a finitely generated group with PIG is residually finite-soluble then it is a linear group.   These results apply in particular to boundedly generated groups; they imply that every infinite BG residually finite group has an infinite linear quotient.
