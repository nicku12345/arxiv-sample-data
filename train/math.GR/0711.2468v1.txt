Results of the computation of the automorphism groups for the groups of orders 16p and 16p^{2} are given. In some cases it has not been possible to give as complete a set of results as was done previously for the case of groups of order 8p^2. Problems arise for those groups of the form (C_{p} \times C_{p}) @ \G[16] that occur in the orders p\equiv 1 mod(8) and p\equiv 7 mod(8), where G[16] means any group of order 16. The groups G[16] in question are C_{16}, D_{8}, QD_{8}, and Q_{4}. For the other cases, explicit presentations are presented for the automorphism groups of the groups of orders 16p and 16p^2.
