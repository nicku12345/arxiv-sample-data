We study locally truncated geometries that are parapolar spaces locally of type A_{n-1,j}(K) with n>6 and j=3,4. Residually connected sheaves over these geometries are constructed. It is proved that these geometries are residually connected diagram geometries whose universal 2-covers are truncations of buildings.
