A locally truncated geometry with diagram of type affine E7 is studied. One considers a parapolar space, locally of type A_{7,4}, which is subject to an extra axiom. A covering of this space is constructed; it is proved that this covering space is a rank 6, residually connected, locally truncated diagram geometry which is a homomorphic image of a truncated building of affine type E7. Consequently, the initial parapolar space is also a homomorphic image of a truncated building.
