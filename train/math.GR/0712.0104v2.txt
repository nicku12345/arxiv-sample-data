We investigate the class of root systems R obtained by extending an irreducible root system by a torsion-free group G. In this context there is a Weyl group W and a group U with the presentation by conjugation. We show under additional hypotheses that the kernel of the natural homomorphism from U to W is isomorphic to the kernel of the homomorphism from the abelianization of U to that of W. For this we introduce the concept of a symmetric system, a discrete version of the concept of a symmetric space. Mathematics Subject Classification 2000: 20F55, 17B65, 17B67, 22E65, 22E40.
