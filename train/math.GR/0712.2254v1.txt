We answer a question of Margolis from 1997 by establishing that the maximal subgroup of the minimal ideal of a finitely generated free profinite monoid is a free profinite group. More generally if \mathbf H is variety of finite groups closed under extension and containing \mathbb Z/p\mathbb Z for infinitely may primes p, the corresponding result holds for free pro-\bar{\mathbf H} monoids.
