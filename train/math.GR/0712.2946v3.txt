Let \FN be a free group of finite rank N \geq 2, and let T be an \R-tree with a very small, minimal action of \FN with dense orbits. For any basis \CA of \FN there exists a {\em heart} K_{\CA} \subset \bar T (= the metric completion of T) which is a compact subtree that has the property that the dynamical system of partial isometries a_{i} : K_{\CA} \cap a_{i} K_{\CA} \to a_{i}\inv K_{\CA} \cap K_{\CA}, for each a_{i} \in \CA, defines a tree T_{(K_{\CA}, \CA)} which contains an isometric copy of T as minimal subtree.
