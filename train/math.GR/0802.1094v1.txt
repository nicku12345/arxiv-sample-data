We show that if a finite simple group G isomorphic to PSL(n,q) or PSU(n,q), where either n\ne 4, or q is prime or even, acts on a vector space over a field of the defining characteristic of G, then the corresponding semidirect product contains an element whose order is distinct from every element order of G. As a consequence, we prove that the group PSL(n,q), where n\ne 4 or q prime or even, is recognizable by spectrum from its covers thus giving a partial positive answer to Problem 14.60 from the Kourovka notebook.
