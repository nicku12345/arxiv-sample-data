We lay down the fundations of the theory of groups of finite Morley rank in which local subgroups are solvable and we proceed to the local analysis of these groups. We prove the main Uniqueness Theorem, analogous to the Bender method in finite group theory, and derive its corollaries. We also consider homogeneous cases as well as torsion.
