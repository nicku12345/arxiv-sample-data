The concept of "table algebra" was introduced by Z Arad anf H. Blau in order to study in a uniform way properties of products of conjugacy classes and of irreducible characters of a finite group, Except for certain cases which remain open, Normalized Table Algebras Generated by a Faithful Non- real Element of degree 3. As application we classified finite groups with a faithful non-real irreducible character of dimension 3 without using character theory of finite groups.
