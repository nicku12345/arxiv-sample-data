The Schreier graphs of Thompson's group F with respect to the stabilizer of 1/2 and generators x_0 and x_1, and of its unitary representation in L_2([0,1]) induced by the standard action on the interval [0,1] are explicitly described. The coamenability of the stabilizers of any finite set of dyadic rational numbers is established. The induced subgraph of the right Cayley graph of the positive monoid of F containing all the vertices of the form x_nv, where n>=0 and v is any word over the alphabet {x_0, x_1}, is constructed. It is proved that the latter graph is non-amenable.
