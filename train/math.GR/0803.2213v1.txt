The goal of this paper is to construct and describe certain arithmetic subgroups of the automorphism group of a partially commutative group. More precisely, given an arbitrary finite graph \Gamma we construct an arithmetic subgroup St(L(G)), represented as a subgroup of GL(n,Z), where n is the number of vertices of the graph \Gamma.   In the last section of the paper we give a description of the decomposition of the group of automorphisms St^{conj}(L(G)) as a semidirect product of the group of conjugating automorphisms Conj(G) and St(L(G)). This result is closely related to Theorem 1.4 of the paper arXiv:0710.2573v1.
