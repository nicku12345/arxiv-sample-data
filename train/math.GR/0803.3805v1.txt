We consider largeness of groups given by a presentation of deficiency 1, where the group is respectively free-by-cyclic, LERF or 1-relator. We give the first examples of (finitely generated free)-by-(infinite cyclic) word hyperbolic groups which are large, show that a LERF deficiency 1 group with first Betti number at least 2 is large or the integers times the integers, and show that 2-generator 1-relator groups where the relator has height 1 obey the dichotomy that either the group is large or all its finite images are metacyclic.
