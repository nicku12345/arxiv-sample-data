We show that there exists k \in \bbn and 0 < \e \in\bbr such that for every field F of characteristic zero and for every n \in \bbn, there exists explicitly given linear transformations T_1,..., T_k: F^n \to F^n satisfying the following:   For every subspace W of F^n of dimension less or equal \frac n2,  \dim(W+\suml^k_{i=1} T_iW) \ge (1+\e) \dim W. This answers a question of Avi Wigderson [W]. The case of fields of positive characteristic (and in particular finite fields) is left open.
