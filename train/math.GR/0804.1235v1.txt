Let F be a field of characteristic \neq 2. Let G be an algebraic group defined over F. An element t\in G(F) is called {\bf real} if there exists s\in G(F) such that sts^{-1}=t^{-1}. A semisimple element t in GL_n(F), SL_n(F), O(q), SO(q), Sp(2n) and the groups of type G_2 over F is real if and only if t=\tau_1\tau_2 where \tau_1^2=\pm 1=\tau_2^2 (ref. \cite{st1,st2}). In this paper we extend this result to the semisimple elements in Spin groups when \dim(V)\equiv 0,1,2 \imod 4.
