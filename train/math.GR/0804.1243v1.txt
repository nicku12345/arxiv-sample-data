Let G be an algebraic group over a field k. We call g\in G(k) {\bf real} if g is conjugate to g^{-1} in G(k). In this paper we study reality for groups of type G_2 over fields of characteristic different from 2. Let G be such a group over k. We discuss reality for both semisimple and unipotent elements. We show that a semisimple element in G(k) is real if and only if it is a product of two involutions in G(k). Every unipotent element in G(k) is a product of two involutions in G(k). We discuss reality for G_2 over special fields and construct examples to show that reality fails for semisimple elements in G_2 over \Q and \Q_p. We show that semisimple elements are real for G_2 over k with cd(k)\leq 1. We conclude with examples of nonreal elements in G_2 over k finite, with characteristic k not 2 or 3, which are not semisimple or unipotent.
