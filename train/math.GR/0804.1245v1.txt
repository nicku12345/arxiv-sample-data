Let G be an algebraic group defined over a field k. We call g\in G {\bf real} if g is conjugate to g^{-1} and g\in G(k) as {\bf k-real} if g is real in G(k). An element g\in G is {\bf strongly real} if \exists h\in G, h^{2}=1 (i.e. h is an {\bf involution}) such that hgh^{-1}=g^{-1}. Clearly, strongly real elements are real and are product of two involutions. Let G be a connected adjoint semisimple group over a perfect field k, with -1 in the Weyl group. We prove that any strongly regular k-real element in G(k) is strongly k-real (i.e. is a product of two involutions in G(k)). For classical groups, with some mild exceptions, over an arbitrary field k of characteristic not 2, we prove that k-real semisimple elements are strongly k-real. We compute an obstruction to reality and prove some results on reality specific to fields k with cd(k)\leq 1. Finally, we prove that in a group G of type G_2 over k, characteristic of k different from 2 and 3, any real element in G(k) is strongly k-real. This extends our results in \cite{st}, on reality for semisimple and unipotent real elements in groups of type G_2.
