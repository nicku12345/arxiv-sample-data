We investigate the class of root systems R obtained by extending an A_1-type irreducible root system by a free abelian group G. In this context there is a Weyl group W and a group U with the presentation by conjugation. Both groups are reflection groups with respect to a discrete symmetric space T associated to R. We show that the natural homomorphism U\to W is an isomorphism if and only if an associated subset T^{ab}\setminus\{0\} of G_2=G/2G is 2-independent, i.e. its image under the map G_2\to G_2\otimes G_2, g\mapsto g\otimes g is linearly independent over the Galois field F_2.
