We give a geometric proof based on recent work of Eskin, Fisher and Whyte that the lamplighter group L_n has infinitely many twisted conjugacy classes for any automorphism \vp only when n is divisible by 2 or 3, originally proved by Gon\c{c}alves and Wong. We determine when the wreath product G \wr \Z has this same property for several classes of finite groups G, including symmetric groups and some nilpotent groups.
