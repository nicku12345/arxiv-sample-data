We provide local recognition results for the reflection graphs on spherical Coxeter groups. In particular, we study the case F_4 which is locally recognizable under additional constraints only. It is then demonstrated in the cases A_n and F_4 how these graph theoretical recognition results can be used to characterize the corresponding Coxeter groups in terms of their reflection centralizers. Finally, we outline the connection to the local recognition of Chevalley groups which is particularly important in the classification of the finite simple groups.
