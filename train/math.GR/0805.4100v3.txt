Let (W,S) be a Coxeter system, let S=I \dot{\cup} J be a partition of S such that no element of I is conjugate to an element of J, let \widetilde{J} be the set of W_I-conjugates of elements of J and let \widetilde{W} be the subgroup of W generated by \widetilde{J}. We show that W=\widetilde{W} \rtimes W_I and that (\widetilde{W},\widetilde{J}) is a Coxeter system.
