We introduce the concept of quantifying the extent to which a finitely generated group is residually finite. The quantification is carried out for some examples including free groups, the first Grigorchuk group, finitely generated nilpotent groups, and certain arithmetic groups such as SL_n(\mathbb{Z}). In the context of finite nilpotent quotients, we find a new characterization of nilpotent groups.
