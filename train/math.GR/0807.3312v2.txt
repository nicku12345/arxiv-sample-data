Let \Sigma be the Davis complex for a Coxeter system (W,S). The automorphism group G of \Sigma is naturally a locally compact group, and a simple combinatorial condition due to Haglund--Paulin determines when G is nondiscrete. The Coxeter group W may be regarded as a uniform lattice in G. We show that many such G also admit a nonuniform lattice \Gamma, and an infinite family of uniform lattices with covolumes converging to that of \Gamma. It follows that the set of covolumes of lattices in G is nondiscrete. We also show that the nonuniform lattice \Gamma is not finitely generated. Examples of \Sigma to which our results apply include buildings and non-buildings, and many complexes of dimension greater than 2. To prove these results, we introduce a new tool, that of "group actions on complexes of groups", and use this to construct our lattices as fundamental groups of complexes of groups with universal cover \Sigma.
