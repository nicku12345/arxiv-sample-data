Motivated by a question of A. Rapinchuk concerning general reductive groups, we are investigating the following question: Given a finitely generated integral domain R with field of fractions F, is there a \emph{finitely generated subgroup} \Gamma of SL_2(F) containing SL_2(R)? We shall show in this paper that the answer to this question is negative for any polynomial ring R of the form R = R_0[s,t], where R_0 is a finitely generated integral domain with infinitely many (non--associate) prime elements. The proof applies Bass--Serre theory and reduces to analyzing which elements of SL_2(R) can be generated by elementary matrices with entries in a given finitely generated R--subalgbra of F. Using Bass--Serre theory, we can also exhibit new classes of rings which do not have the GE_2 property introduced by P.M. Cohn.
