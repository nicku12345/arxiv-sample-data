Let S be a finite semigroup. In this paper we introduce the functions \phi_s:S^* \to S^*, first defined by Rhodes, given by \phi_s([a_1,a_2 ,...,a_n]) = [sa_1,sa_1a_2,..., sa_1a_2 ... a_n]. We show that if S is a finite aperiodic semigroup, then the semigroup generated by the functions \{\phi_s\}_{s \in S} is finite and aperiodic.
