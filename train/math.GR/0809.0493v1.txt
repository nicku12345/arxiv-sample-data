In this paper, I show that if p is an odd prime, and if P is a finite p-group, then there exists an exact sequence of abelian groups 0\to T(P)\to D(P)\to\lproj{P}\to H^1\big(\apdeux(P),\Z\big)^{(P)}, where D(P) is the Dade group of P and T(P) is the subgroup of endo-trivial modules. Here \lproj{P} is the group of sequences of compatible elements in the Dade groups D\big(N_P(Q)/Q\big) for non trivial subgroups Q of P. The poset \apdeux(P) is the set of elementary abelian subgroups of rank at least 2 of P, ordered by inclusion. The group H^1\big(\apdeux(P),\Z\big)^{(P)} is the subgroup of H^1\big(\apdeux(P),\Z\big) consisting of classes of P-invariant 1-cocycles. Here \lproj{P} is the group of sequences of compatible elements in the Dade groups D\big(N_P(Q)/Q\big) for non trivial subgroups Q of P. The poset \apdeux(P) is the set of elementary abelian subgroups of rank at least 2 of P, ordered by inclusion. The group H^1\big(\apdeux(P),\Z\big)^{(P)} is the subgroup of H^1\big(\apdeux(P),\Z\big) consisting of classes of P-invariant 1-cocycles. A key result to prove that the above sequence is exact is a characterization of elements of 2D(P) by sequences of integers, indexed by sections (T,S) of P such that T/S\cong (\Z/p\Z)^2, fulfilling certain conditions associated to subquotients of P which are either elementary abelian of rank~3, or extraspecial of order p^3 and exponent p.
