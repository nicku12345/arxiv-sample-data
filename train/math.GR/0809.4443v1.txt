This paper contains the more significant part of the article with the same title that will appear in the Volume 12 of Journal of Group Theory (2009).   In this paper we determine all algebraic transformation groups G, defined over an algebraically closed field \sf k, which operate transitively, but not primitively, on a variety \Omega, provided the following conditions are fulfilled. We ask that the (non-effective) action of G on the variety of blocks is sharply 2-transitive, as well as the action on a block \Delta of the normalizer G_\Delta. Also we require sharp transitivity on pairs (X,Y) of independent points of \Omega, i.e. points contained in different blocks.
