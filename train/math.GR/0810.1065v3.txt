An \emph{automorphic loop} (or \emph{A-loop}) is a loop whose inner mappings are automorphisms. Every element of a commutative A-loop generates a group, and (xy)^{-1} = x^{-1}y^{-1} holds. Let Q be a finite commutative A-loop and p a prime. The loop Q has order a power of p if and only if every element of Q has order a power of p. The loop Q decomposes as a direct product of a loop of odd order and a loop of order a power of 2. If Q is of odd order, it is solvable. If A is a subloop of Q then |A| divides |Q|. If p divides |Q| then Q contains an element of order p. If there is a finite simple nonassociative commutative A-loop, it is of exponent 2.
