We initiate the study of profinite groups of non-negative deficiency. The principal focus of the paper is to show that the existence of a finitely generated normal subgroup of infinite index in a profinite group G of non-negative deficiency gives rather strong consequences for the structure of G. To make this precise we introduce the notion of p-deficiency (p a prime) for a profinite group G. This concept is more useful in the study of profinite groups then the notion of deficiency. We prove that if the p-deficiency of G is positive and N is a finitely generated normal subgroup such that the p-Sylow subgroup of G/N is infinite and p divides the order of N then we have \cd_p(G)=2, \cd_p(N)=1 and \vcd_p(G/N)=1 for the cohomological p-dimensions; moreover either the p-Sylow subgroup of G/N is virtually cyclic or the p-Sylow subgroup of N is cyclic. A profinite Poincar\'e duality group G of dimension 3 at a prime p (PD^3-group) has deficiency 0. In this case we show that for N and p as above either N is PD^1 at p and G/N is virtually PD^2 at p or N is PD^2 at p and G/N is virtually PD^1 at p. In particular if G is pro-p then either N is infinite cyclic and G/N is virtually Demushkin or N is Demushkin and G/N is virtually infinite cyclic. We apply this results to deduce structural information on the profinite completions of ascending HNN-extensions of free groups. We also give some implications of our theory to the congruence kernels of certain arithmetic groups.
