A subgroup of a finite group G is said to be second maximal if it is maximal in every maximal subgroup of G that contains it. A question which has received considerable attention asks: can every positive integer occur as the number of the maximal subgroups that contain a given second maximal subgroup in some finite group G? Various reduction arguments are available except when G is almost simple. Following the classification of the finite simple groups, finite almost simple groups fall into three categories: alternating and symmetric groups, almost simple groups of Lie type, sporadic groups and automorphism groups of sporadic groups. This thesis investigates the finite alternating and symmetric groups, and finds that in such groups, except three well known examples, no second maximal subgroup can be contained in more than 3 maximal subgroups.
