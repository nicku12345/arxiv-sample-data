We study the general theory of asymptotically CAT(0) groups, explaining why such a group has finitely many conjugacy classes of finite subgroups, is F_\infty and has solvable word problem. We provide techniques to combine asymptotically CAT(0) groups via direct products, amalgams and HNN extensions.   The universal cover of the Lie group PSL(2,\mathbb{R}) is shown to be an asymptotically CAT(0) metric space. Therefore, co-compact lattices in \widetilde{PSL(2,\mathbb{R})} provide the first examples of asymptotically CAT(0) groups which are neither CAT(0) nor hyperbolic. Another source of examples is shown to be the class of relatively hyperbolic groups.
