We prove that for any finite Thurston-type ordering <_{T} on the braid group\ B_{n}, the restriction to the positive braid monoid (B_{n}^{+},<_{T}) is a\ well-ordered set of order type \omega^{\omega^{n-2}}. The proof uses a combi\ natorial description of the ordering <_{T}. Our combinatorial description is \ based on a new normal form for positive braids which we call the \C-normal fo\ rm. It can be seen as a generalization of Burckel's normal form and Dehornoy's \ \Phi-normal form (alternating normal form).
