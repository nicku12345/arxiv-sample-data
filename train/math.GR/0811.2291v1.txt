The concept of configuration was first introduced by Rosenblatt and Willis to give a condition for amenability of groups. We show that if G_1 and G_2 have the same configuration sets and H_1 is a normal subgroup of G_1 with abelian quotient, then there is a normal subgroup H_2 of G_2 such that \frac{G_1}{H_1}\cong\frac{G_2}{H_2}. Also configuration of FC-groups and isomorphism is studied.
