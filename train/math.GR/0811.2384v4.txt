Let G be a group which is hyperbolic relative to a collection of subgroups A, and it is also hyperbolic relative to a collection of subgroups B. Suppose that the collection A contains B. We characterize, for subgroups of G, when quasicovexity relative to A implies quasiconvexity relative to B. We also show that quasiconvexity relative to B implies quasiconvexity relative to A. Some applications are discussed.
