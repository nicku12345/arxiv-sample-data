We show that Wall's D(2) problem, the Realization problem and the Relation Gap problem could all be solved if it could be shown that the deficiency of a certain group is, as intuition would suggest, less than -1.   Note the paper has been withdrawn. A presentation of *_p (C_p x C_p)with deficiency -1 is given on p35 of: Cynthia Hog-Angeloni, Beitrage zum (einfachen) homotopietyp zweidimensionaler komplexe zu freein produkten und anderen gruppentheoretischen konstruktionen : PhD thesis, Frankfurt/Main 1988
