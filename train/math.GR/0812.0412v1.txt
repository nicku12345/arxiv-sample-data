Let Q be a Buchsteiner loop. We describe the associator calculus in three variables, and show that |Q| \ge 32 if Q is not conjugacy closed. We also show that |Q| \ge 64 if there exists x \in Q such that x^2 is not in the nucleus of Q. Furthermore, we describe a general construction that yields all proper Buchsteiner loops of order 32. Finally, we produce a Buchsteiner loop of order 128 that is nilpotency class 3 and possesses an abelian inner mapping group.
