In this paper, we consider lifts of \pi-partial characters with the property that the irreducible constituents of their restrictions to certain normal subgroups are also lifts. We will show that such a lift must be induced from what we call an inductive pair, and every character induced from an inductive pair is a such a lift. With this condition, we will get a lower bound on the number of such lifts.
