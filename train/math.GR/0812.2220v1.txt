Isaacs has defined a character to be super monomial if every primitive character inducing it is linear. Isaacs has conjectured that if G is an M-group with odd order, then every irreducible character is super monomial. We prove that the conjecture is true if G is an M-group of odd order where every irreducible character is a \{p \}-lift for some prime p. We say that a group where irreducible character is super monomial is a super M-group. We use our results to find an example of a super M-group that has a subgroup that is not a super M-group.
