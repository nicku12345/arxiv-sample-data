Let G be the automorphism group of a regular right-angled building X. The "standard uniform lattice" \Gamma_0 in G is a canonical graph product of finite groups, which acts discretely on X with quotient a chamber. We prove that the commensurator of \Gamma_0 is dense in G. This result was also obtained by Haglund. For our proof, we develop carefully a technique of "unfoldings" of complexes of groups. We use unfoldings to construct a sequence of uniform lattices \Gamma_n in G, each commensurable to \Gamma_0, and then apply the theory of group actions on complexes of groups to the sequence \Gamma_n. As further applications of unfoldings, we determine exactly when the group G is nondiscrete, and we prove that G acts strongly transitively on X.
