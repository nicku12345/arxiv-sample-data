In his paper "Finite groups have many conjugacy classes" (J. London Math. Soc (2) 46 (1992), 239-249), L. Pyber proved the to date best general lower bounds for the number of conjugacy classes of a finite group in terms of the order of the group. In this paper we strengthen the main results in Pyber's paper.
