We describe a new presentation for the complex reflection groups of type (e,e,r) and their braid groups. A diagram for this presentation is proposed. The presentation is a monoid presentation which is shown to give rise to a Garside structure. A detailed study of the combinatorics of this structure leads us to describe it as post-classical.
