Let X be a building of arbitrary type. A compactification C_r(X) of the set Res(X) of spherical residues of X is introduced. We prove that it coincides with the horofunction compactification of Res(X) endowed with a natural combinatorial distance which we call the root-distance. Points of C_r(X) admit amenable stabilisers in Aut(X) and conversely, any amenable subgroup virtually fixes a point in C_r(X). In addition, it is shown that, provided Aut(X)is transitive enough, this compactification also coincides with the group-theoretic compactification constructed using the Chabauty topology on closed subgroups of Aut(X). This generalises to arbitrary buildings results established by Y. Guivarc'h and B. R\'emy in the Bruhat--Tits case.
