We prove that there exists a constant k with the property: if \calC is a conjugacy class of a finite group G such that every k elements of \calC\ generate a solvable subgroup then \calC generates a solvable subgroup. In particular, using the Classification of Finite Simple Groups, we show that we can take k=4. We also present proofs that do not use the Classification theorem. The most direct proof gives a value of k=10. By lengthening one of our arguments slightly, we obtain a value of k=7.
