In this paper we study left and right 4-Engel elements of a group. In particular, we prove that <a, a^b> is nilpotent of class at most 4, whenever a is any element and b^{\pm 1} are right 4-Engel elements or a^{\pm 1} are left 4-Engel elements and b is an arbitrary element of G. Furthermore we prove that for any prime p and any element a of finite p-power order in a group G such that a^{\pm 1}\in L_4(G), a^4, if p=2, and a^p, if p is an odd prime number, is in the Baer radical of G.
