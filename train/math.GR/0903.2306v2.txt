Let H be a torsion-free \delta-hyperbolic group with respect to a finite generating set S. Let a_1,..., a_n and a_{1*},..., a_{n*} be elements of H such that a_{i*} is conjugate to a_i for each i=1,..., n. Then, there is a uniform conjugator if and only if W(a_{1*},..., a_{n*}) is conjugate to W(a_1,..., a_n) for every word W in n variables and length up to a computable constant depending only on \delta, \sharp{S} and \sum_{i=1}^n |a_i|.   As a corollary, we deduce that there exists a computable constant \mathcal{C}=\mathcal{C}(\delta, \sharp S) such that, for any endomorphism \phi of H, if \phi(h) is conjugate to h for every element h\in H of length up to \mathcal {C}, then \phi is an inner automorphism.   Another corollary is the following: if H is a torsion-free conjugacy separable hyperbolic group, then \text{\rm Out}(H) is residually finite.   When particularizing the main result to the case of free groups, we obtain a solution for a mixed version of the classical Whitehead's algorithm.
