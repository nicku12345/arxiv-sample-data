We show that any soluble group G of type Bredon-\FP_{\infty} with respect to the family of all virtually cyclic subgroups such that centralizers of infinite order elements are of type \FP_{\infty} must be virtually cyclic. To prove this, we first reduce the problem to the case of polycyclic groups and then we show that a polycyclic-by-finite group with finitely many conjugacy classes of maximal virtually cyclic subgroups is virtually cyclic. Finally we discuss refinements of this result: we only impose the property Bredon-\FP_n for some n \leq 3 and restrict to abelian-by-nilpotent, abelian-by-polycyclic or (nilpotent of class 2)-by-abelian groups.
