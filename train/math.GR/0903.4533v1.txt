We describe the Reidemeister spectrum Spec_RG for G = N_{rc}, the free nilpotent group of rank r and class c, in the cases: r \in {\mathbb N} and c = 1; r = 2, 3 and c = 2;  r = 2 and c = 3, and prove that any group N_{2c} for c \geq 4 satisfies to the R_{\infty} property. As a consequence we obtain that every free solvable group S_{2t} of rank 2 and class t \geq 2 (in particular the free metabelian group M_2 = S_{22} of rank 2) satisfies to the R_{\infty} property. Moreover, we prove that any free solvable group S_{rt} of rank r \geq 2 and class t big enough also satisfies to the R_{\infty} property.
