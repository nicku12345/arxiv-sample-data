We prove that the bicrossed product of two groups is a quotient of the pushout of two semidirect products. A matched pair of groups (H, G, \alpha, \beta) is deformed using a combinatorial datum (\sigma, v, r) consisting of an automorphism \sigma of H, a permutation v of the set G and a transition map r: G\to H in order to obtain a new matched pair \bigl(H, (G,*), \alpha', \beta' \bigl) such that there exist an \sigma-invariant isomorphism of groups H {}_{\alpha} \bowtie_{\beta} G \cong H {}_{\alpha'} \bowtie_{\beta'} (G,*). Moreover, if we fix the group H and the automorphism \sigma \in \Aut(H) then any \sigma-invariant isomorphism H {}_{\alpha} \bowtie_{\beta} G \cong H {}_{\alpha'} \bowtie_{\beta'} G' between two arbitrary bicrossed product of groups is obtained in a unique way by the above deformation method. As applications two Schreier type classification theorems for bicrossed product of groups are given.
