Let S_5 denote the symmetric group on 5 letters, and let \hat{S}_5 denote a non-trivial double cover of S_5 whose Sylow 2-subgroups are generalized quaternion. We determine the universal deformation rings R(S_5,V) and R(\hat{S}_5,V) for each mod 2 representation V of S_5 that belongs to the principal 2-modular block of S_5 and whose stable endomorphism ring is given by scalars when it is inflated to \hat{S}_5. We show that for these V, a question raised by the first author and Chinburg concerning the relation of the universal deformation ring of V to the Sylow 2-subgroups of S_5 and \hat{S}_5, respectively, has an affirmative answer.
