A concrete family of automorphisms alpha_n of the free group F_n is exhibited, for any n > 2, and the following properties are proved: alpha_n is irreducible with irreducible powers, has trivial fixed subgroup, and has 2n-1 attractive as well as 2n repelling fixed points at bdry F_n. As a consequence of a recent result of V Guirardel there can not be more fixed points on bdry F_n, so that this family provides the answer to a question posed by G Levitt.
