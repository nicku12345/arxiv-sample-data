The aim of this note is to answer a question by Guoliang Yu of whether the group EL_3(Z<x,y>), where Z<x,y> is the free (non-commutative) ring, has any faithful linear representations over a field. We prove, in particular, that for every (unitary associative) ring R, the group EL_3(R) has a faithful finite dimensional complex representation if and only if R has a finite index ideal that has a faithful finite dimensional complex representation.
