We construct an analogue of the normaliser decomposition for p-local finite groups (S,F,L) with respect to collections of F-centric subgroups and collections of elementary abelian subgroups of S. This enables us to describe the classifying space of a p-local finite group, before p-completion, as the homotopy colimit of a diagram of classifying spaces of finite groups whose shape is a poset and all maps are induced by group monomorphisms.
