In this paper we consider the existence of dense embeddings of Limit groups in locally compact groups generalizing earlier work of Breuillard, Gelander, Souto and Storm [GBSS] where surface groups were considered. Our main results are proved in the context of compact groups and algebraic groups over local fields. In addition we prove a generalization of the classical Baumslag lemma which is a useful tool for generating eventually faithful sequences of homomorphisms. The last section is dedicated to correct a mistake from [BGSS] and to get rid of the even genus assumption.
