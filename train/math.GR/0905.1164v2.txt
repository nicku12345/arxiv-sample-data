In this paper we continue our investgation of the prime graph of a finite simple group started in http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0506294 (the printed version appeared in [1]). We describe all cocliques of maximal size for all finite simple groups and also we correct mistakes and misprints from our previous paper. The list of correction is given in Appendix of the present paper.
