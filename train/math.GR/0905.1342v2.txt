Let G be a finite group and A, B and D be conjugacy classes of  G with D\subseteq AB=\{xy\mid x\in A, y\in B\}. Denote by \eta(AB) the number of distinct conjugacy classes such that AB is the union of those. Set {\bf C}_G(A)=\{g\in G\mid x^g=x {for all} x\in A\}. If AB=D then {\bf C}_G(D)/({\bf C}_G(A)\cap{\bf C}_G(B)) is an abelian group. If, in addition, G is supersolvable, then the derived length of {\bf C}_G(D)/({\bf C}_G(A)\cap{\bf C}_G(B)) is bounded above by 2\eta(AB).
