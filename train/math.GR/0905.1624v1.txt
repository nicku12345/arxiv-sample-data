A residually finite (profinite) group G is just infinite if every non-trivial (closed) normal subgroup of G is of finite index. This paper considers the problem of determining whether a (closed) subgroup H of a just infinite group is itself just infinite. If G is not virtually abelian, we give a description of the just infinite property for normal subgroups in terms of maximal subgroups. In particular, we show that such a group G is hereditarily just infinite if and only if all maximal subgroups of finite index are just infinite. We also obtain results for certain families of virtually abelian groups, including all virtually abelian pro-p groups and their discrete analogues.
