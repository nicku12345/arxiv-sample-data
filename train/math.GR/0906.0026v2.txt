Let G({\mathbb F}_{q}) be a finite Chevalley group defined over the field of q=p^{r} elements, and k be an algebraically closed field of characteristic p>0. A fundamental open and elusive problem has been the computation of the cohomology ring \opH^{\bullet}(G({\mathbb F}_{q}),k). In this paper we determine initial vanishing ranges which improves upon known results. For root systems of type A_n and C_n, the first non-trivial cohomology classes are determined when p is larger than the Coxeter number (larger than twice the Coxeter number for type A_n with n>1 and r >1). In the process we make use of techniques involving line bundle cohomology for the flag variety G/B and its relation to combinatorial data from Kostant Partition Functions.
