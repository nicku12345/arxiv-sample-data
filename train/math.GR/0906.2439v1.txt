Let R_n(G) denotes the set of all right n-Engel elements of a group G. We show that in any group G whose 5th term of lower central series has no element of order 2, R_3(G) is a subgroup. Furthermore we prove that R_4(G) is a subgroup for locally nilpotent groups G without elements of orders 2, 3 or 5; and in this case the normal closure <x >^G is nilpotent of class at most 7 for each x\in R_4(G). Using a group constructed by Newman and Nickel we also show that, for each n\geq 5, there exists a nilpotent group of class n+2 containing a right n-Engel element x and an element a\in G such that both [x^{-1},_n a] and [x^{k},_n a] are of infinite order for all integers k\geq 2. We finish the paper by proving that at least one of the following happens: (1) There is an infinite finitely generated k-Engel group of exponent n for some positive integer k and some 2-power number n. (2) There is a group generated by finitely many bounded left Engel elements which is not an Engel group.
