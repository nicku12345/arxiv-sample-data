Is every locally compact abelian group which admits a symplectic self-duality isomorphic to the product of a locally compact abelian group and its Pontryagin dual? Several sufficient conditions, covering all the typical applications are found. Counterexamples are produced by studying a seemingly unrelated question about the structure of maximal isotropic subgroups of finite abelian groups with symplectic self-duality (where the original question always has an affirmative answer).
