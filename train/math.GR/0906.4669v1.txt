We give an explicit construction of the Ree groups of type G_2 as groups acting on mixed Moufang hexagons together with detailed proofs of the basic properties of these groups contained in the two fundamental papers of Tits on this subject. We also give a short proof that the norm of a Ree group is anisotropic.
