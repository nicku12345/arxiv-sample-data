Let \Lambda be a minimal Kac-Moody group of rank 2 defined over the finite field F_q, where q = p^a with p prime. Let G be the topological Kac-Moody group obtained by completing \Lambda. An example is G=SL_2(K), where K is the field of formal Laurent series over F_q. The group G acts on its Bruhat-Tits building X, a tree, with quotient a single edge. We construct new examples of cocompact lattices in G, many of them edge-transitive. We then show that if cocompact lattices in G do not contain p-elements, the lattices we construct are the only edge-transitive lattices in G, and that our constructions include the cocompact lattice of minimal covolume in G. We also observe that, with an additional assumption on p-elements in G, the arguments of Lubotzky for the case G = SL_2(K) may be generalised to show that there is a positive lower bound on the covolumes of all lattices in G, and that this minimum is realised by a non-cocompact lattice, a maximal parabolic subgroup of Lambda.
