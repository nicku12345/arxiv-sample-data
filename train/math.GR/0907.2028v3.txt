Let G be a group. We say that G has spread r if for any set of distinct elements {x1,..., xr}\subset G there exists an element y\in G with the property that <xi, y>=G for every 0<i<r+1. Few bounds on the spread of finite simple groups are known. In this paper we present improved upper bounds for the spread of many of the sporadic simple groups, in some cases improving on the best known upper bound by several orders of magnitude.
