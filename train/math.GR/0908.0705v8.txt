We describe the kernel of the canonical map from the Floyd boundary of a relatively hyperbolic group to its Bowditch boundary.   Using our methods we then prove that a finitely generated group H admitting a quasi-isometric map \phi into a relatively hyperbolic group G is relatively hyperbolic with respect to a system of subgroups whose image under \phi is situated in a uniformly bounded distance from the parabolic subgroups of G.
