We produce a sequence of markings S_k of Thompson's group F within the space {\mathcal G}_n of all marked n-generator groups so that the sequence (F,S_k) converges to the free group on n generators, for n \geq 3. In addition, we give presentations for the limits of some other natural (convergent) sequences of markings to consider on F within {\mathcal G}_3, including (F,\{x_0,x_1,x_n\}) and (F,\{x_0,x_1,x_0^n\}).
