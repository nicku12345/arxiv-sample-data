In this article we give an self contained existence proof for J. Conway's sporadic simple group Co_1 [4] using the second author's algorithm [14] constructing finite simple groups from irreducible subgroups of GL_n(2). Here n = 11 and the irreducible subgroup is the Mathieu group M_{24}. From the split extension E of M_{24} by a uniquely determined 11-dimensional GF(2)M_{24}-module V we construct the centralizer H = C_G(z) of a 2-central involution z of E in an unknown target group G. Then we prove that all the conditions of Algorithm 2.5 of [14] are satisfied. This allows us to construct a simple subgroup G of GL_{276}(23) which we prove to be isomorphic with Conway's original sporadic simple group Co_1 by means of a constructed faithful permutation representation of G and Soicher's presentation [16] of the original Conway group Co_1.
