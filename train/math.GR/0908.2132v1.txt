A unital \ell-group (G,u) is an abelian group G equipped with a translation-invariant lattice-order and a distinguished element u, called order-unit, whose positive integer multiples eventually dominate each element of G. We classify finitely generated unital \ell-groups by sequences \mathcal W = (W_{0},W_{1},...) of weighted abstract simplicial complexes, where W_{t+1} is obtained from W_{t} either by the classical Alexander binary stellar operation, or by deleting a maximal simplex of W_{t}. A simple criterion is given to recognize when two such sequences classify isomorphic unital \ell-groups. Many properties of the unital \ell-group (G,u) can be directly read off from its associated sequence: for instance, the properties of being totally ordered, archimedean, finitely presented, simplicial, free.
