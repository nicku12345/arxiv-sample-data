We determine the universal deformation ring R(G,V) of certain mod 2 representations V of a finite group G which belong to a 2-modular block of G whose defect groups are isomorphic to a generalized quaternion group D. We show that for these V, a question raised by the author and Chinburg concerning the relation of R(G,V) to D has an affirmative answer. We also show that R(G,V) is a complete intersection even though R(G/N,V) need not be for certain normal subgroups N of G which act trivially on V.
