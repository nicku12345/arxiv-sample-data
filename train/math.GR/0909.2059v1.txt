The purpose of this paper is to provide an easier set of axioms for Affine \Lambda-Buildings by extending results of Anne Parreau on the equivalence of axioms for Euclidean buildings. In particular we give an easier set of axioms for an affine \Lambda-building, utilizing a notion of a strong exchange condition on apartments and sectors having a sector panel lying in an apartment.
