The present article continues the study of median groups initiated in [6, 9, 10]. Some classes of median groups are introduced and investigated with a stress upon the class of the so called A-groups which contains as remarkable subclasses the lattice ordered groups and the right-angled Artin groups. Some general results concerning A-groups are applied to a systematic study of the arboreal structure of right-angled Artin groups. Structure theorems for foldings, directions, quasidirections and centralizers are proved.
