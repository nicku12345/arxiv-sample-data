This paper introduces and develops a general framework for studying triple factorisations of the form G=ABA of finite groups G, with A and B subgroups of G. We call such a factorisation nondegenerate if G\neq AB. Consideration of the action of G by right multiplication on the right cosets of B leads to a nontrivial upper bound for |G| by applying results about subsets of restricted movement. For A<C<G and B<D<G the factorisation G=CDC may be degenerate even if G=ABA is nondegenerate. Similarly forming quotients may lead to degenerate triple factorisations. A rationale is given for reducing the study of nondegenerate triple factorisations to those in which G acts faithfully and primitively on the cosets of A. This involves study of a wreath product construction for triple factorisations.
