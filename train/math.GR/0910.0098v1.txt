We associate a graph \mathcal{N}_{G} with a group   G (called the non-nilpotent graph of G) as follows: take G as the vertex set and two vertices are adjacent if they generate a non-nilpotent subgroup. In this paper we study the graph theoretical properties of \mathcal{N}_{G} and its induced subgraph on G\backslash nil(G), where nil(G)=\{x\in G | < x,y> \text{is nilpotent for all} y\in G\}. For any finite group G, we prove that \mathcal{N}_G has either |Z^*(G)| or |Z^*(G)|+1 connected components, where Z^*(G) is the hypercenter of G. We give a new characterization for finite nilpotent groups in terms of the non-nilpotent graph. In fact we prove that a finite group G is nilpotent if and only if the set of vertex degrees of \mathcal{N}_G has at most two elements.
