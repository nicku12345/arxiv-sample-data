Small overlap conditions are simple and natural combinatorial conditions on semigroup and monoid presentations, which serve to limit the complexity of derivation sequences between equivalent words in the generators. They were introduced by J.H.Remmers, and more recently have been extensively studied by the present author. However, the definition of small overlap conditions hitherto used by the author was slightly more restrictive than that introduced by Remmers; this note eliminates this discrepancy by extending the recent methods and results of the author to apply to Remmers' small overlap monoids in full generality.
