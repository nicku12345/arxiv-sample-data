An amalgam of groups can be viewed as a Sudoku game inside a group. You are given a set of subgroups and their intersections and you need to decide what the largest group containing such a structure can be. In a recent paper (0907.1388v1) we used Bass-Serre theory of graphs of groups to classify all possible amalgams of Curtis-Tits shape with a given diagram. This note describes the method for general rank two amalgams.
