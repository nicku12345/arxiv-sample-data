A group is called \Lambda-free if it has a free Lyndon length function in an ordered abelian group \Lambda, which is equivalent to having a free isometric action on a \Lambda-tree. A group has a regular free length function in \Lambda if and only if it has a free isometric action on a \Lambda-tree so that all branch points belong to the orbit of the base point. In this paper we prove that every finitely presented \Lambda-free group G can be embedded into a finitely presented group with a regular free length function in \Lambda so that the length function on G is preserved by the embedding. Next, we prove that every finitely presented group \widetilde G with a regular free Lyndon length function in \Lambda has a regular free Lyndon length function in {\mathbb R}^n ordered lexicographically for an appropriate n and can be obtained from a free group by a series of finitely many HNN-extensions in which associated subgroups are maximal abelian and length isomorphic.
