Let a be a non-invertible transformation of a finite set and let G be a group of permutations on that same set. Then \genset{G, a}\setminus G is a subsemigroup, consisting of all non-invertible transformations, in the semigroup generated by G and a. Likewise, the conjugates a^g=g^{-1}ag of a by elements g\in G generate a semigroup denoted \genset{a^g | g\in G}. We classify the finite permutation groups G on a finite set X such that the semigroups \genset{G,a}, \genset{G, a}\setminus G, and \genset{a^g | g\in G} are regular for all transformations of X. We also classify the permutation groups G on a finite set X such that the semigroups \genset{G, a}\setminus G and \genset{a^g | g\in G} are generated by their idempotents for all non-invertible transformations of X.
