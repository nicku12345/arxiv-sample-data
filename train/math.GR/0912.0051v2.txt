We show that a topological semigroup of finite partial bijections \mathscr{I}_\lambda^n of an infinite set with a compact subsemigroup of idempotents is absolutely H-closed and any countably compact topological semigroup does not contain \mathscr{I}_\lambda^n as a subsemigroup. We give sufficient conditions onto a topological semigroup \mathscr{I}_\lambda^1 to be non-H-closed. Also we describe the structure of countably compact Brandt \lambda^0-extensions of topological monoids and study the category of countably compact Brandt \lambda^0-extensions of topological monoids with zero.
