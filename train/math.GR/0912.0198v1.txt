We study topological properties of the symmetric inverse topological semigroup of finite transformations \mathscr{I}_\lambda^n of the rank \leqslant n. We show that the topological inverse semigroup \mathscr{I}_\lambda^n is algebraically h-closed in the class of topological inverse semigroups. Also we prove that a topological semigroup S with countably compact square S\times S does not contain the semigroup \mathscr{I}_\lambda^n for infinite cardinal \lambda and show that the Bohr compactification of an infinite topological symmetric inverse semigroup of finite transformations \mathscr{I}_\lambda^n of the rank \leqslant n is the trivial semigroup.
