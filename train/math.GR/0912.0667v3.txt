The structure of a group which is not nilpotent but all of whose proper subgroups are nilpotent has interested the researches of several authors both in the finite case and in the infinite case. The present paper generalizes some classic descriptions of M. Newman, H. Smith and J. Wiegold in the context of supersolvable groups.
