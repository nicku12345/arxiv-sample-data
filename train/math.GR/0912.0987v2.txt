Let k be an algebraically closed field of characteristic 2, and let G be a finite group. Suppose B is a block of kG with dihedral defect groups such that there are precisely two isomorphism classes of simple B-modules. The description by Erdmann of the quiver and relations of the basic algebra of B is usually only given up to a certain parameter c which is either 0 or 1. In this article, we show that c=0 if there exists a central extension \hat{G} of G by a group of order 2 together with a block \hat{B} of k\hat{G} with generalized quaternion defect groups such that B is contained in the image of \hat{B} under the natural surjection from k\hat{G} onto kG. As a special case, we obtain that c=0 if G=\mathrm{PGL}_2(\mathbb{F}_q) for some odd prime power q and B is the principal block of k \mathrm{PGL}_2(\mathbb{F}_q).
