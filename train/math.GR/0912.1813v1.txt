Certain topological properties of the group \J(\k) of all formal one-variable power series with coefficients in a topological unitary ring \k are considered. We show, in particular, that in the case when \k=\Q the group \J(\Q) has no continuous bijections into a locally compact group. In the case when \k=\Z supplied with discrete topology, in spite of the fact that the group \J(\Z) has continuous bijections into compact groups, it cannot be embedded into a locally compact group. In the final part of the paper the compression property for topological groups is considered. We establish the compressibility of \J(\Z).
