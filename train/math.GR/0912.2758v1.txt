We show that every Coxeter group that is not virtually abelian and for which all labels in the corresponding Coxeter graph are powers of 2 or infinity can be mapped onto uncountably many infinite 2-groups which, in addition, may be chosen to be just-infinite, branch groups of intermediate growth. Also we answer affirmatively a question raised by Wiegold in Kourovka Notebook.
