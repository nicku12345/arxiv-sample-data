Let G be a finite group and G_p be a Sylow p-subgroup of G for a prime p in \pi(G), the set of all prime divisors of the order of G. The automiser A_p(G) is defined to be the group N_G(G_p)/G_pC_G(G_p). We define the Sylow graph \Gamma_A(G) of the group G, with set of vertices \pi(G), as follows: Two vertices p,q\in\pi(G) form an edge of \Gamma_A(G) if either q\in\pi(A_p(G)) or p\in \pi(A_q(G)). The following result is obtained:   Theorem: Let G be a finite almost simple group. Then the graph \Gamma_A(G) is connected and has diameter at most 5.   We also show how this result can be applied to derive information on the structure of a group from the normalizers of its Sylow subgroups.
