The rank rk(G) of a profinite group G is the supremum of d(H), where H ranges over all closed subgroups of G and d(H) denotes the minimal cardinality of a topological generating set for H. A compact topological group G admits the structure of a p-adic Lie group if and only if it contains an open pro-p subgroup of finite rank.   For every compact p-adic Lie group G the rank rk(G) is greater than or equal to dim(G), where dim(G) denotes the dimension of G as a p-adic manifold. In this paper we consider the converse problem, bounding rk(G) in terms of dim(G).   Every profinite group G of finite rank admits a maximal finite normal subgroup, its periodic radical. One of our main results is the following. Let G be a compact p-adic Lie group with trivial periodic radical, and suppose that p is odd. If G has trivial (p-1)-torsion, then rk(G) = dim(G).
