This is a survey of two papers joint with A. Borisov and a paper joint with I. Spakulova. It is based on my lectures at the conference "Groups St. Andrews 2009", Bath (August 2009). We prove that almost all 1-related groups with at least 3 generators are virtually residually (finite p-)groups for almost all primes p, and coherent. The proof involves methods from combinatorial group theory (the congruence extension property of certain subgroups of free groups) algebraic geometry (dynamics of polynomial maps over finite and p-adic fields) and probability theory (convex hulls of Brownian bridges).
