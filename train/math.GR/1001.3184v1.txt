We present a one sided Monte--Carlo algorithm which constructs a long root \sl_2(q)-subgroup in X/O_p(X), where X is a black-box group and X/O_p(X) is a finite simple group of Lie type defined over a field of odd order q=p^k > 3 for some k\geqslant 1. Our algorithm is based on the analysis of the structure of centralizers of involutions and can be viewed as a computational version of Aschbacher's Classical Involution Theorem. We also present an algorithm which determines whether the p-core (or "unipotent radical") O_p(X) of a black-box group X is trivial or not, where X/O_p(X) is a finite simple classical group of odd characteristic p. This answers a well-known question of Babai and Shalev.
