Let S be a fixed symmetric finite subset of SL_d(O_K) that generates a Zariski dense subgroup of SL_d(O_K) when we consider it as an algebraic group over Q by restriction of scalars. We prove that the Cayley graphs of SL_d(O_K/I) with respect to the projections of S is an expander family if I ranges over square-free ideals of O_K if d=2 and K is an arbitrary numberfield, or if d=3 and K=Q.
