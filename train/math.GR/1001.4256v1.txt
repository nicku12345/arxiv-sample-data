It has been proved in \cite{ge} for every p-group of order p^n, |\mathcal{M}(G)|=p^{\f{1}{2}n(n-1)-t(G)}, where t(G)\geq 0. In \cite{be, el, zh}, the structure of G has been characterized for t(G)=0,1,2,3 by several authors. Also in \cite{sa}, the structure of G characterized when t(G)=4 and Z(G) is elementary abelian. This paper is devoted to classify the structure of G when t(G)=4 without any condition.
