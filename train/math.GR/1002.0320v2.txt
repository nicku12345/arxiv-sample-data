Let (G_n,X_n) be a sequence of finite transitive permutation groups with uniformly bounded number of generators. We prove that the infinitely iterated permutational wreath product ...\wr G_2\wr G_1 is topologically finitely generated if and only if the profinite abelian group \prod_{n\geq 1} G_n/G'_n is topologically finitely generated. As a corollary, for a finite transitive group G the minimal number of generators of the wreath power G\wr...\wr G\wr G (n times) is bounded if G is perfect, and grows linearly if G is non-perfect. As a by-product we construct a finitely generated branch group, which has maximal subgroups of infinite index, answering [2,Question 14].
