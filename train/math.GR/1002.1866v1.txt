We study centralisers of finite order automorphisms of generalisations of Thompson's group F and conjugacy classes of finite subgroups in finite extensions of these groups. In particular, we show that centralisers of finite automorphisms in these generalised Thompson groups either admit a finite type classifying space or are not finitely generated. As an application we deduce results about the Bredon type of such finite extensions.
