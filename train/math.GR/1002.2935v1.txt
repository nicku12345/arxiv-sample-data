Broadly speaking, a finiteness property of groups is any generalisation of the property of having finite order. A large part of infinite group theory is concerned with finiteness properties and the relationships between them. Profinite groups are an important case of this, being compact topological groups that possess an intimate connection with their finite images. This thesis investigates the relationship between several finiteness properties that a profinite group may have, with consequences for the structure of finite and profinite groups.
