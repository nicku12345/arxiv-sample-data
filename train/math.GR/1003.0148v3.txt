We prove that groups in a certain class of metabelian locally compact groups, have quadratic Dehn function. As an application, we embed the solvable Baumslag-Solitar groups into finitely presented metabelian groups with quadratic Dehn function. Also, we prove that Baumslag's finitely presented metabelian groups, in which the lamplighter groups embed, have quadratic Dehn function.
