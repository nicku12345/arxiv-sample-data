The author in (On the order of Schur multiplier of non-abelian p-groups. J. Algebra (2009).322: 4479--4482) showed that for any p-group G of order p^n there exists a nonnegative integer s(G) such that the order of Schur multiplier of G is equal to p^{\f{1}{2}(n-1)(n-2)+1-s(G)}. Furthermore, he characterized the structure of all non-abelian p-groups G when s(G)=0. The present paper is devoted to characterization of all p-groups when s(G)=2.
