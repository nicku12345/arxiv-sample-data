We identify the images of the comparision maps from ordinary homology and Sobolev homology, respectively, to the l^1-homology of a word-hyperbolic group with coefficients in complete normed modules. The underlying idea is that there is a subdivision procedure for singular chains in negatively curved spaces that is much more efficient (in terms of the l^1-norm) than barycentric subdivision. The results of this paper are an important ingredient in a forthcoming proof of the authors that hyperbolic lattices in dimension at least 3 are rigid with respect to integrable measure equivalence. Moreover, we prove a proportionality principle for the simplicial volume of negatively curved manifolds with regard to integrable measure equivalence.
