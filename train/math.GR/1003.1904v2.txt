We introduce a strong form of Oliver's p-group conjecture and derive a reformulation in terms of the modular representation theory of a quotient group. The Sylow p-subgroups of the symmetric group S_n and of the general linear group GL_n(F_q) satisfy both the strong conjecture and its reformulation.
