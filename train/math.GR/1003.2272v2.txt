A classification is given of rank 3 group actions which are quasiprimitive but not primitive. There are two infinite families and a finite number of individual imprimitive examples. When combined with earlier work of Bannai, Kantor, Liebler, Liebeck and Saxl, this yields a classification of all quasiprimitive rank 3 permutation groups. Our classification is achieved by first classifying imprimitive almost simple permutation groups which induce a 2-transitive action on a block system and for which a block stabiliser acts 2-transitively on the block. We also determine those imprimitive rank 3 permutation groups G such that the induced action on a block is almost simple and G does not contain the full socle of the natural wreath product in which G embeds.
