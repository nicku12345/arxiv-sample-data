P. Hall introduced the notion of isoclinism between two groups more than 60 years ago. Successively, many authors have extended such a notion in different contexts. The present paper deals with the notion of relative n-isoclinism, given by N. S. Hekster in 1986, and with the notion of n-th relative nilpotency degree, recently introduced in literature.
