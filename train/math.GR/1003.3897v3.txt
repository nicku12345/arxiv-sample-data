Let N be a normal subgroup of a group G. An N-module Q is G-stable provided that Q is equivalent to the twist Q^g of Q by g, for every g\in G. If the action of N on Q extends to an action of G on Q, Q is obviously G-stable, but the converse need not hold. A famous conjecture in the modular representation theory of reductive algebraic groups G asserts that the (obviously G-stable) projective indecomposable modules (PIMs) Q for the Frobenius kernels of G have a G-module structure. It is sometimes just as useful (for a general module Q) to know that a finite direct sum Q^{\oplus n} of Q has a compatible G-module structure. In this paper, this property is called numerical stability. In recent work (arXiv:0909.5207v2), the authors established numerical stability in the special case of PIMs. We provide in this paper a more general context for that result, working in the context of group schemes and a suitable version of G-stability, called strong G-stability. Among our results here is the presentation of a homological obstruction to the existence of a G-module structure, on strongly G-stable modules, and a tensor product approach to killing the obstruction.
