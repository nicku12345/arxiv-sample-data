We provide a new and much simpler structure for quasi-ideal adequate transversals of abundant semigroups in terms of spined products, which is similar in nature to that given by Saito for weakly multiplicative inverse transversals of regular semigroups. As a consequence we deduce a similar result for multiplicative transversals of abundant semigroups and also consider the case when the semigroups are in fact regular and provide some new structure theorems for inverse transversals.
