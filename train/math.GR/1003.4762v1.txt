Let F be an infinitely generated free group and R a fully invariant subgroup of F such that (a) R is contained in the commutator subgroup F' of F and (b) the quotient group F/R is residually torsion-free nilpotent. Then the automorphism group Aut(F/R') of the group F/R' is complete. In particular, the automorphism group of any infinitely generated free solvalbe group of derived length at least two is complete. This extends a result by Dyer and Formanek (1977) on finitely generated groups F_n/R' where F_n is a free group of finite rank n at least two and R a characteristic subgroup of F_n.
