Let w = w(x_1,..., x_n) be a word, i.e. an element of the free group F =<x_1,...,x_n> on n generators x_1,..., x_n. The verbal subgroup w(G) of a group G is the subgroup generated by the set \{w (g_1,...,g_n)^{\pm 1} | g_i \in G, 1\leq i\leq n \} of all w-values in G. We say that a (finite) group G is w-maximal if |G:w(G)|> |H:w(H)| for all proper subgroups H of G and that G is hereditarily w-maximal if every subgroup of G is w-maximal. In this text we study w-maximal and hereditarily w-maximal (finite) groups.
