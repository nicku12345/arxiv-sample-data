A residually nilpotent group is \emph{k-parafree} if all of its lower central series quotients match those of a free group of rank k. Magnus proved that k-parafree groups of rank k are themselves free. In this note we mimic this theory with finite extensions of free groups, with an emphasis on free products of the cyclic group C_p, for p an odd prime. We show that for n \leq p Magnus' characterization holds for the n-fold free product C_p^{*n} within the class of finite-extensions of free groups. Specifically, if n \leq p and G is a finitely generated, virtually free, residually nilpotent group having the same lower central series quotients as C_p^{*n}, then G \cong C_p^{*n}. We also show that such a characterization does not hold in the class of finitely generated groups. That is, we construct a rank 2 residually nilpotent group G that shares all its lower central series quotients with \ffp, but is not \ffp.
