Motivated by an observation in "Vertices, sources and Green correspondents of the simple modules for the large Mathieu groups", J. of Algebra 322, we determine the source algebra, and therefore all the structure, of the blocks without essential Brauer pairs where the simple modules of all the Brauer corespondents have trivial sources.
