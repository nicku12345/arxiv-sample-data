We show that the refinement of Alperin's Conjecture proposed in "Frobenius Categories versus Brauer Blocks", Progress in Math. 274, can be proved by checking that this refinement holds on any central k*-extension of a finite group H containing a normal simple group S with trivial centralizer in H and p'-cyclic quotient H/S. This paper improves our result in [ibidem, Theorem 16.45] and repairs some bad arguments there.
