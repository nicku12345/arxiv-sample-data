We characterize permutational wreath products with Property (FA). For instance, the standard wreath product A wr B of two nontrivial countable groups A,B, has Property (FA) if and only if B has Property (FA) and A is a finitely generated group with finite abelianisation. We also prove an analogous result for hereditary Property (FA). On the other hand, we prove that many wreath products with hereditary Property (FA) are not quotients of finitely presented groups with the same property.
