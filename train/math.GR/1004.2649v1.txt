Given f in GL(d,Z), it is decidable whether its mapping torus (the semi-direct product of Z^d with Z) may be generated by two elements or not; if so, one can classify generating pairs up to Nielsen equivalence. If f has infinite order, the mapping torus of f^n cannot be generated by two elements for n large enough; equivalently, f^n is not conjugate to a companion matrix in GL(d,Z) if n is large.
