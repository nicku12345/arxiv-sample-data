The Bernoulli measure on strings is used to define height functions for the dense R- and L-orders of the Thompson-Higman monoids M_{k,1}. The measure can also be used to characterize the D-relation of certain submonoids of M_{k,1}. The computational complexity of computing the Bernoulli measure of certain sets, and in particular, of computing the R- and L-height of an element of M_{k,1} is investigated.
