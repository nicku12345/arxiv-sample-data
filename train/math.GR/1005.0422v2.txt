Let G be the universal Chevalley-Demazure group scheme corresponding to a reduced irreducible root system of rank \geq 2, and let R be a commutative ring. We analyze the linear representations \rho \colon G(R)^+ \to GL_n (K) over an algebraically closed field K of the elementary subgroup G(R)^+ \subset G(R). Our main result is that under certain conditions, any such representation has a standard description, i.e. there exists a commutative finite-dimensional K-algebra B, a ring homomorphism f \colon R \to B with Zariski-dense image, and a morphism of algebraic groups \sigma \colon G(B) \to GL_n (K) such that \rho coincides with \sigma \circ F on a suitable finite index subgroup \Gamma \subset G(R)^+, where F \colon G(R)^+ \to G(B)^+ is the group homomorphism induced by f. In particular, this confirms a conjecture of Borel and Tits for Chevalley groups over a field of characteristic zero.
