The group G is called n-rewritable for n>1, if for each sequence of n elements x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n \in G there exists a non-identity permutation \sigma \in S_n such that x_1 x_2 \cdots x_n = x_{\sigma(1)} x_{\sigma(2)} \cdots x_{\sigma(n)}. Using computers, Blyth and Robinson (1990) verified that the alternating group A_5 is 8-rewritable. We report on an independent verification of this statement using the computational algebra system GAP, and compare the performance of our sequential and parallel code with the original one.
