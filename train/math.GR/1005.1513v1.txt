In 1962 M.J.Wicks gave a list of forms for commutators in both free groups and free products. Since then similar lists have been constructed for elements of higher genus. A. Vdovina has described a method for the construction of forms for elements of any genus in free products. We give a similar result for the construction of such forms in any hyperbolic group H and from this we obtain a full list of forms for commutators in H.
