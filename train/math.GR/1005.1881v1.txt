We establish various results on the structure of approximate subgroups in linear groups such as SL_n(k) that were previously announced by the authors. For example, generalising a result of Helfgott (who handled the cases n = 2 and 3), we show that any approximate subgroup of SL_n(F_q) which generates the group must be either very small or else nearly all of SL_n(F_q). The argument generalises to other absolutely almost simple connected (and non-commutative) algebraic groups G over a finite field k. In a subsequent paper, we will give applications of this result to the expansion properties of Cayley graphs.
