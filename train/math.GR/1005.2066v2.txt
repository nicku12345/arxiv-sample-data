An automorphism \alpha of a group G is said to be central if \alpha commutes with every inner automorphism of G. We construct a family of non-special finite p-groups having abelian automorphism groups. These groups provide counter examples to a conjecture of A. Mahalanobis [Israel J. Math., {\bf 165} (2008), 161 - 187]. We also construct a family of finite p-groups having non-abelian automorphism groups and all automorphisms central. This solves a problem of I. Malinowska [Advances in group theory, Aracne Editrice, Rome 2002, 111-127].
