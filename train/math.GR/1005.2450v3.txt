Let k be a field with a nontrivial discrete valuation which is complete and has perfect residue field. Let G be the group of k-rational points of a reductive, linear algebraic group \textbf{G} equipped with an involution \theta defined over k. Let \mathfrak{p} denote the (-1)-eigenspace in the decomposition of the Lie algebra of G under the differential d\theta. If \textbf{H} is a subgroup of \textbf{G}^{\theta}, the set of \theta-fixed points, which contains the connected component of \textbf{G}^{\theta}, then H=\textbf{H}(k) acts on \mathfrak{p}, which we treat as a symmetric space. Let r \in \mathbb{R}. Under mild restrictions on \textbf{G} and k, the set of nilpotent H-orbits in \mathfrak{p} is parametrized by equivalence classes of noticed Moy-Prasad cosets of depth r which lie in \mathfrak{p}.
