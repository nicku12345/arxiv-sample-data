In the paper we study (countably) compact and (absolutely) H-closed primitive topological inverse semigroups. We describe the structure of compact and countably compact primitive topological inverse semigroups and show that any countably compact primitive topological inverse semigroup embeds into a compact primitive topological inverse semigroup.
