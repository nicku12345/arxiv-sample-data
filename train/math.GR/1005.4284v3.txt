Let H\leq K be subgroups of a group G. We say that H is strongly closed in K with respect to G if whenever a^g \in K where a \in H, g \in G, then a^g \in H. In this paper, we investigate the structure of a group G under the assumption that every subgroup of order 2^m (and 4 if m = 1) of a 2- Sylow subgroup S of G is strongly closed in S with respect to G. Some results related to 2-nilpotence and supersolvability of a group G are obtained. This is a complement to Guo and Wei (J. Group Theory 13 (2010), no. 2, 267-276).
