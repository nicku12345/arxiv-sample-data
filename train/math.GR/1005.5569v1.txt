We present a variation of quasi-isometry to approach the problem of defining a geometric notion equivalent to commensurability. In short, this variation can be summarized as "quasi-isometry with uniform parameters for a large enough family of generating systems". Two similar notions (using isometries and rough isometries instead, respectively) are presented alongside.   This article is based mainly on a chapter of the author's doctoral thesis (\cite{Lochmann_dissertation}).
