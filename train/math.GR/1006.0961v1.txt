Eick & Leedham-Green sketched a construction for infinite sequences of finite p-groups with fixed coclass. These infinite sequences have turned out to be very useful in the theory of finite p-groups. We exhibit a detailed description for the construction of the finite sequences and we determine presentations for the infinite sequences for the primes and coclasses (2,1), (2,2) and (3,1).
