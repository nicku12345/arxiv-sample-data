We generalize [Vav] to give sufficient conditions, primarily on coarse geometry, to ensure that a subset of a Cayley graph is a finite Hausdorff distance from a subgroup. Using this result, we prove a partial converse to the Flat Torus Theorem for CAT(0) groups. Also using this result, we give sufficient conditions for subgroups and splittings to be invariant under quasi-isometries.
