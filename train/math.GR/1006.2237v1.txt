We introduce and investigate notions of persistent homology for p-groups and for coclass trees of p-groups. Using computer techniques we show that persistent homology provides fairly strong homological invariants for p-groups of order at most 81. The strength of these invariants, and some elementary theoretical properties, suggest that persistent homology may be a useful tool in the study of prime-power groups.
