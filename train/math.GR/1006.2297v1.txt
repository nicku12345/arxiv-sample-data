Let S_{g,1,p} be an orientable surface of genus g with one boundary component and p punctures. Let \mathcal{M}_{g,1,p} be the mapping-class group of S_{g,1,p} relative to the boundary. We construct homomorphisms \mathcal{M}_{g,1,p} \to \mathcal{M}_{g',1,(b-1)}, where g' \geq 0 and b\geq 1. We proof that the constructed homomorphisms \M_{g,1,p} \to \M_{g',1,(b-1)} are injective. One of these embeddings for g = 0 is classic.
