A semigroup is \emph{regular} if it contains at least one idempotent in each \mathcal{R}-class and in each \mathcal{L}-class. A regular semigroup is \emph{inverse} if satisfies either of the following equivalent conditions: (i) there is a unique idempotent in each \mathcal{R}-class and in each \mathcal{L}-class, or (ii) the idempotents commute.   Analogously, a semigroup is \emph{abundant} if it contains at least one idempotent in each \mathcal{R}^*-class and in each \mathcal{L}^*-class. An abundant semigroup is \emph{adequate} if its idempotents commute. In adequate semigroups, there is a unique idempotent in each \mathcal{R}^* and \mathcal{L}^*-class. M. Kambites raised the question of the converse: in a finite abundant semigroup such that there is a unique idempotent in each \mathcal{R}^* and \mathcal{L}^*-class, must the idempotents commute? In this note we use ideal extensions to provide a negative answer to this question.
