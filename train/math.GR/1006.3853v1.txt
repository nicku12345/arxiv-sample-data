A distributive lattice L with minimum element 0 is called decomposable if a and b are not comparable elements in L then there exist \overline{a},\overline{b}\in L such that a=\overline{a}\vee(a\wedge b), b=\overline{b}\vee(a\wedge b) and \overline{a}\wedge \overline{b}=0. The main purpose of this paper is to study the structure of decomposable lattices determined by their prime ideals. The properties for five special decomposable lattices are derived.
