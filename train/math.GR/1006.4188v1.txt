Let G be an \ell-group (which is short for ``lattice-ordered abelian group''). Baker and Beynon proved that G is finitely presented iff it is finitely generated and projective. In the category \mathcal U of {\it unital} \ell-groups---those \ell-groups having a distinguished order-unit u---only the (\Leftarrow)-direction holds in general. Morphisms in \mathcal U are {\it unital \ell-homomorphisms,} i.e., hom\-o\-mor\-phisms that preserve the order-unit and the lattice structure. We show that a unital \ell-group (G,u) is finitely presented iff it has a basis, i.e., G is generated by an abstract Schauder basis over its maximal spectral space. Thus every finitely generated projective unital \ell-group has a basis \mathcal B. As a partial converse, a large class of projectives is constructed from bases satisfying \bigwedge\mathcal B\not=0. Without using the Effros-Handelman-Shen theorem, we finally show that the bases of any finitely presented unital \ell-group (G,u) provide a direct system of simplicial groups with 1-1 positive unital homomorphisms, whose limit is (G,u).
