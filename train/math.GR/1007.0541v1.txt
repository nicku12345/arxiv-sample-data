For every finite-to-one map \lambda:\Gamma\to\Gamma and for every abelian group K, the generalized shift \sigma_\lambda of the direct sum \bigoplus_\Gamma K is the endomorphism defined by (x_i)_{i\in\Gamma}\mapsto(x_{\lambda(i)})_{i\in\Gamma}. In this paper we analyze and compute the algebraic entropy of a generalized shift, which turns out to depend on the cardinality of K, but mainly on the function \lambda. We give many examples showing that the generalized shifts provide a very useful universal tool for producing counter-examples.
