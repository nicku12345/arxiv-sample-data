If G is a finite group and x\in G then the set of all elements of G having the same order as x is called {\em an order subset of G determined by x} (see [2]). We say that G is a {\em group with perfect order subsets} or briefly, G is a {\em POS-group} if the number of elements in each order subset of G is a divisor of |G|. In this paper we prove that for any n\geq 4, the symmetric group S_n is not POS-group. This gives the positive answer to one of two questions rising from Conjecture 5.2 in [3].
