Let G be an affine algebraic group over an algrebraically closed field \mathbb K of characteristic 0 and H be a subgroup of G. The stabilizer of all the set of all vector-functions of \mathbb K[G]^H with respect to the right action of H is \hat H. V^H=V^{\hat H} for a G-module V. The subgroup H is called observable if H=\hat H and epimorphic if G=\hat H. In this work I show that under some natural restrictions H is observable if and only if some orbit of some group contains 0 in the closure and H is epimorphic if and only the same orbit is closed.
