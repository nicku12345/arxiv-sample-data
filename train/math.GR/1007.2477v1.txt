We discuss various methods and their effectiveness for solving linear equations over finitely generated abelian groups. More precisely, if \varphi\colon G\to H is a homomorphism of finitely generated abelian groups and b\in H, we discuss various algorithms for checking whether b\in \im\varphi holds and if so, for computing a pre-image of b in G together with the kernel of \varphi.
