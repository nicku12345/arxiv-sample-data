We use Schlage-Puchta's concept of p-deficiency and Lackenby's property of p-largeness to show that a group having a finite presentation with p-deficiency greater than 1 is large, which implies that Schlage-Puchta's infinite finitely generated p-groups are not finitely presented. We also show that for all primes p at least 7, any group having a presentation of p-deficiency greater than 1 is Golod-Shafarevich, and has a finite index subgroup which is Golod-Shafarevich for the remaining primes. We also generalise a result of Grigorchuk on Coxeter groups to odd primes.
