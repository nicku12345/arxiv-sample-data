For an element g in a group X, we say that g has 2-part order 2^{a} if 2^{a} is the largest power of 2 dividing the order of g. We prove lower bounds on the proportion of elements in finite classical groups in odd characteristic that have certain 2-part orders. In particular, we show that the proportion of odd order elements in the symplectic and orthogonal groups is at least C/\ell^{3/4}, where \ell is the Lie rank, and C is an explicit constant. We also prove positive constant lower bounds for the proportion of elements of certain 2-part orders independent of the Lie rank. Furthermore, we describe how these results can be used to analyze part of Yal\c{c}inkaya's Black Box recognition algorithm for finite classical groups in odd characteristic.
