In this paper we examine the behavior of lifts of Brauer characters in p-solvable groups where p is an odd prime. In the main result, we show that if \phi \in IBrp(G) is a Brauer character of a solvable group such that \phi has an abelian vertex subgroup Q, then the number of lifts of \phi in Irr(G) is at most |Q|. In order to accomplish this, we develop several results about lifts of Brauer characters in p-solvable groups that were previously only known to be true in the case of groups of odd order.
