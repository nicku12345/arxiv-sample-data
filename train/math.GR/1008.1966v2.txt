Baumslag's group is a finitely presented metabelian group with a Z \wr Z subgroup. There is an analogue with an additional torsion relation in which this subgroup becomes C_m \wr Z. We prove that Baumslag's group has an exponential Dehn function. This contrasts with the torsion analogues which have quadratic Dehn functions. v.2: version for publication, incorporating referee's suggestions.
