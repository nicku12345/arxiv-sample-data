The probability that a randomly chosen element of a finite group is an r--th root (for any integer r\geq2) has been studied largely in case r=2. Certain techniques may be generalized for r>2 and here we find the exact value of this probability for projective special linear groups. A result of density is placed at the end, in order to show an analogy with the case r=2.
