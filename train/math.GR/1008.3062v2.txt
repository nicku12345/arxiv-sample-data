Various connections between the theory of permutation groups and the theory of topological groups are described. These connections are applied in permutation group theory and in the structure theory of topological groups.   The first draft of these notes was written for lectures at the conference Totally disconnected groups, graphs and geometry in Blaubeuren, Germany, 2007.
