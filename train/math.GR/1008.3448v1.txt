The concept of hypergroup is generalization of group, first was introduced by Marty [9]. This theory had applications to several domains. Marty had applied them to groups, algebraic functions and rational functions. M. Krasner has studied the notion of hyperring in [11]. G.G Massouros and C.G Massouros defined hyperringoids and apply them in generalization of rings in [10]. They also defined fortified hypergroups as a generalization of divisibility in algebraic structures and use them in Automata and Language theory. T. Vougiouklis has defined the representations and fundamental relations in hyperrings in [14, 15]. R. Ameri, H. Hedayati defined k-hyperideals in semihyperrings in [2]. B. Davvaz has defined some relations in hyperrings and prove Isomorphism theorems in [7]. The aim of this article is to initiate the study of semihyperrings and characterize it with hyperideals. In this article we defined semihyperrings, hyperideals, prime, semiprime, irreducible, strongly irreducible hyperideals, m-systems, p-systems, i-systems and regular semihyperrings. We also shown that the lattice of irreducible hyperideals of semihyperring R admits the structure of topology, which is called irreducible spectrum topology.
