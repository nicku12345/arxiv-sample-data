A semigroup variety is said to be a Rees-Sushkevich variety if it is contained in a periodic variety generated by 0-simple semigroups. S. I. Kublanovsky has proven that a variety V is a Rees-Sushkevich variety if and only it does not contain any of special finite semigroups. These semigroups are called indicator Burnside semigroups. It is shown that indicator Burnside semigroups have polynomially decidable equational theory. Also it is shown that each indicator Burnside semigroups generate a finitely based variety.
