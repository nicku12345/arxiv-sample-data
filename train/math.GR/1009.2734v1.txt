Following the work done by Olshanskii for groups, we describe, for a given semigroup S, which functions l : S \rightarrow \mathbb{N} can be realized up to equivalence as length functions g \mapsto |g|_{H} by embedding S into a finitely generated semigroup H. We also, following the work done by Olshanskii and Sapir, provide a complete description of length functions of a given finitely generated semigroup with enumerable set of relations inside a finitely presented semigroup.
