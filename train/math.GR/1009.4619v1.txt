It is well known that G=\langle x,y:x^2=y^3=1\rangle represents the modular group PSL(2,Z), where x:z\rightarrow\frac{-1}{z}, y:z\rightarrow\frac{z-1}{z} are linear fractional transformations. Let n=k^2m, where k is any non zero integer and m is square free positive integer. Then the set Q^*(\sqrt{n}):=\{\frac{a+\sqrt{n}}{c}:a,c,b=\frac{a^2-n}{c}\in Z~\textmd{and}~(a,b,c)=1\} is a G-subset of the real quadratic field Q(\sqrt{m}) \cite{R9}. We denote \alpha=\frac{a+\sqrt{n}}{c} in  Q^*(\sqrt{n}) by \alpha(a,b,c). For a fixed integer s>1, we say that two elements \alpha(a,b,c), \alpha'(a',b',c') of Q^*(\sqrt{n}) are s-equivalent if and only if a\equiv a'(mod~s), b\equiv b'(mod~s) and c\equiv c'(mod~s). The class [a,b,c](mod~s) contains all s-equivalent elements of Q^*(\sqrt{n}) and E^n_s denotes the set consisting of all such classes of the form [a,b,c](mod~s).   In this paper we investigate proper G-subsets and G-orbits of the set Q^*(\sqrt{n}) under the action of Modular Group G
