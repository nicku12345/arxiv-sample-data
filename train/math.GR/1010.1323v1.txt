A complete mapping of a group G is a permutation \phi:G\rightarrow G such that g\mapsto g\phi(g) is also a permutation. Complete mappings of G are equivalent to tranversals of the Cayley table of G, considered as a latin square. In 1953, Hall and Paige proved that a finite group admits a complete mapping only if its Sylow-2 subgroup is trivial or non-cyclic. They conjectured that this condition is also sufficient. We prove that it is sufficient to check the conjecture for the 26 sporadic simple groups and the Tits group.
