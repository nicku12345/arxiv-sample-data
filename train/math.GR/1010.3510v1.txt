In this paper, we have introduced the concept of \left( \in ,\in \vee q\right) -fuzzy ideals in a right modular groupoid. We have discussed several important features of a completely regular right modular groupoid by using the \left( \in ,\in \vee q\right) -fuzzy left (right, two-sided) ideals, \left( \in ,\in \vee q\right) -fuzzy (generalized) bi-ideals and \left( \in ,\in \vee q\right) -fuzzy (1,2)-ideals. We have also used the concept of \left( \in ,\in \vee q_{k}\right) -fuzzy left (right, two-sided) ideals, \left( \in ,\in \vee q_{k}\right) -fuzzy quasi-ideals \left( \in ,\in \vee q_{k}\right) -fuzzy bi-ideals and % \left( \in ,\in \vee q_{k}\right) -fuzzy interior ideals in completely regular right modular groupoid and proved that the \left( \in ,\in \vee q_{k}\right) -fuzzy left (right, two-sided), \left( \in ,\in \vee q_{k}\right) -fuzzy (generalized) bi-ideals, and \left( \in ,\in \vee q_{k}\right) -fuzzy interior ideals coincide in a completely regular right modular groupoid.
