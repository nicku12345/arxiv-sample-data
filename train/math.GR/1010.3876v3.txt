If m is a positive integer or infinity, the m-layer (or briefly, the layer) of a group G is the subgroup G_m generated by all elements of G of order m. This notion goes back to some contributions of Ya.D. Polovickii of almost 60 years ago and is often investigated, because the presence of layers influences the group structure. If G_m is finite for all m, G is called FL-group (or FO-group). A generalization is given by CL-groups, that is, groups in which G_m is a Chernikov group for all m. By working on the notion of CL-group instead of that of FL-group, we extend a recent result of Z. Zhang, describing the structure of a group which is not a CL-group, but whose proper subgroups are CL-groups.
