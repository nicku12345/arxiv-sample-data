Using the idea of a quasi-coincedece of a fuzzy point with a fuzzy set, the concept of an ({\alpha},{\beta})-fuzzy bi-ibeals in AG-groupoid is introduced in this paper, which is a generalization of the concept of a fuzzy bi-ideal in AG-groupoid and some interesting characterizations theorems are obtained.
