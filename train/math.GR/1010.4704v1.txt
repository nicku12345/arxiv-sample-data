In this paper, we have discussed the properties of intuitionistic fuzzy ideals of an AG-groupoids. We have characterized an intra-regular AG-groupoid in terms of intuitionistic fuzzy left (right, two-sided) ideals, fuzzy (generalized) bi-ideals, intuitionistic fuzzy interior ideals and intuitionistic fuzzy quasi ideals. We have proved that the intuitionistic fuzzy left (right, interior, quasi) ideal coincides in an intra-regular AG-groupoid. We have also shown that the set of intuitionistic fuzzy two-sided ideals of an intra-regular AG-groupoid forms a semilattice structure.
