In this paper, we have investigated different classes of an AG-groupoid by their structural properties. We have prove that weakly regular, intra-regular, right regular, left regular, left quasi regular and completely regular coincide in an AG-groupoid with left identity and in AG^{**}-groupoid. Further we have prove that every regular (weakly regular, intra-regular, right regular, left regular, left quasi regular, completely regular) AG-groupoid with left identity (AG^{**}-groupoid) is regular but the converse is not true in general. Also it has been shown that non-associative regular, weakly regular, intra-regular, right regular, left regular, left quasi regular and completely regular AG^{*} groupoids do not exist.
