We consider space functions s(n) of finitely presented groups G =< A\mid R> . (These functions have a natural geometric analog.) To define s(n) we start with a word w over A of length at most n equal to 1 in G and use relations from R for elementary transformations to obtain the empty word; s(n) bounds from above the tape space (or computer memory) one needs to transform any word of length at most n vanishing in G to the empty word. One of the main obtained results is the following criterion: A finitely generated group H has decidable word problem of polynomial space complexity if and only if H is a subgroup of a finitely presented group G with a polynomial space function.
