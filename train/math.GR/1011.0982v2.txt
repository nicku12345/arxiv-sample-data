A loop is automorphic if its inner mappings are automorphisms. Using so-called associated operations, we show that every commutative automorphic loop of odd prime power order is centrally nilpotent. Starting with anisotropic planes in the vector space of 2\times 2 matrices over the field of prime order p, we construct a family of automorphic loops of order p^3 with trivial center.
