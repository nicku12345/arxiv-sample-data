We explore the relationship between limit spaces of contracting self-similar groups and self-similar structures. We give the condition on a contracting group such that its limit space admits a self-similar structure, and also the condition such that this self-similar structure is p.c.f. We then give the necessary and sufficient condition on a p.c.f. self-similar structure such that there exists a contracting group whose limit space has an isomorphic self-similar structure; in this case, we provide a construction that produces such a contracting group. Finally, we illustrate our results with several examples.
