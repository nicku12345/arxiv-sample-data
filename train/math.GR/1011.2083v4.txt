In 1904, Issai Schur proved the following result. If G is an arbitrary group such that G/\Z(G) is finite, where \Z(G) denotes the center of the group G, then the commutator subgroup of G is finite. A partial converse of this result was proved by B. H. Neumann in 1951. He proved that if G is a finitely generated group with finite commutator subgroup, then G/\Z(G) is finite. In this short note, we exhibit few arguments of Neumann, which provide further generalizations of converse of the above mentioned result of Schur. We classify all finite groups G such that |G/\Z(G)| = |\gamma_2(G)|^d, where d denotes the number of elements in a minimal generating set for G/\Z(G). Some problems and questions are posed in the sequel.
