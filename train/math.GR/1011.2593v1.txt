Let G be a p-group of nilpotency class k with finite exponent \exp(G) and let m=\lfloor\log_pk\rfloor. We show that \exp(M^{(c)}(G)) divides \exp(G)p^{m(k-1)}, for all c\geq1, where M^{(c)}(G) denotes the c-nilpotent multiplier of G. This implies that \exp(M(G)) divides \exp(G) for all finite p-groups of class at most p-1. Moreover, we show that our result is an improvement of some previous bounds for the exponent of M^{(c)}(G) given by M. R. Jones, G. Ellis and P. Moravec in some cases.
