In this paper, we have discussed several properties of intuitionistic fuzzy {\Gamma}-ideals of a {\Gamma}-AG-groupoid which is the generalization of ideals in AG-groupoid We have characterized an intra-regular {\Gamma}-AG^{**}-groupoid in terms of intuitionistic fuzzy {\Gamma}-left (right, two-sided) ideals, intuitionistic fuzzy ({\Gamma}-generalized bi) {\Gamma}-bi-ideals, intuitionistic fuzzy {\Gamma}-interior ideals and intuitionistic fuzzy {\Gamma}-quasi ideals. We have proved that the intuitionistic fuzzy {\Gamma}-left (right, interior, quasi) ideals coincide in an intra-regular {\Gamma}-AG^{**}-groupoid. We have also shown that the set of intuitionistic fuzzy {\Gamma}-two-sided ideals of an intra-regular {\Gamma}-AG^{**}-groupoid forms a semilattice structure.
