In this paper we prove that the profinite completion \mathcal{\hat G} of the Grigorchuk group \mathcal{G} is not finitely presented as a profinite group. We obtain this result by showing that H^2(\mathcal{\hat G},\field{F}_2) is infinite dimensional. Also several results are proven about the finite quotients \mathcal{G}/ St_{\mathcal{G}}(n) including minimal presentations and Schur Multipliers.
