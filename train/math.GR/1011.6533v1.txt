Using the Kirillov orbit method, novel methods from p-adic integration and Clifford theory, we study representation zeta functions associated to compact p-adic analytic groups. In particular, we give general estimates for the abscissae of convergence of such zeta functions. We compute explicit formulae for the representation zeta functions of some compact p-adic analytic groups, defined over a compact discrete valuation ring O of characteristic 0. These include principal congruence subgroups of SL_2(O), without any restrictions on the residue field characteristic of O, as well as the norm one group SL_1(D) of a non-split quaternion algebra D over the field of fractions of O and its principal congruence subgroups. We also determine the representation zeta functions of principal congruence subgroups of SL_3(O) in the case that O has residue field characteristic 3 and is unramified over Z_3.
