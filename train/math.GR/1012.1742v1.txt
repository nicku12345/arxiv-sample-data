The paper is devoted to finding a homomorphic image for the c-nilpotent multiplier of the verbal product of a family of groups with respect to a variety {\mathcal V} when {\mathcal V} \subseteq {\mathcal N}_{c} or {\mathcal N}_{c}\subseteq {\mathcal V}. Also a structure of the c-nilpotent multiplier of a special case of the verbal product, the nilpotent product, of cyclic groups is given. In fact, we present an explicit formula for the c-nilpotent multiplier of the nth nilpotent product of the group G= {\bf {Z}}\stackrel{n}{*}...\stackrel{n}{*}{\bf {Z}}\stackrel{n}{*} {\bf {Z}}_{r_1}\stackrel{n}{*}...\stackrel{n}{*}{\bf{Z}}_{r_t}, where r_{i+1} divides r_i for all i, 1 \leq i \leq t-1, and (p,r_1)=1 for any prime p less than or equal to n+c, for all positive integers n, c.
