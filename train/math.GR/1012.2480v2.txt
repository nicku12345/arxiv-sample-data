Let G be an almost simple group. We prove that if x \in G has prime order p \ge 5, then there exists an involution y such that <x,y> is not solvable. Also, if x is an involution then there exist three conjugates of x that generate a nonsolvable group, unless x belongs to a short list of exceptions, which are described explicitly. We also prove that if x has order 6 or 9, then there exists two conjugates that generate a nonsolvable group.
