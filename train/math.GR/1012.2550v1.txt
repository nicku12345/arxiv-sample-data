We study algebraic and topological properties of subsemigroups of the hyperspace exp(G) of non-empty compact subsets of a topological group G endowed with the Vietoris topology and the natural semigroup operation. On this base we prove that a compact Clifford topological semigroup S is topologically isomorphic to a subsemigroup of exp(G) for a suitable topological group G if and only if S is a topological inverse semigroup with zero-dimensional idempotent semilattice.
