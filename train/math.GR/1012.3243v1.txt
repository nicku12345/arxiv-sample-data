In this paper we present some inequalities for the order, the exponent, and the number of generators of the c-nilpotent multiplier (the Baer invariant with respect to the variety of nilpotent groups of class at most c \geq 1) of a powerful p-group. Our results extend some of Lubotzky and Mann^{,}s (Journal of Algebra, 105 (1987), 484-505.) to nilpotent multipliers. Also, we give some explicit examples showing the tightness of our results and improvement some of the previous inequalities.
