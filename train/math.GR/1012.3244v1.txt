We present an explicit structure for the Baer invariant of a finitely generated abelian group with respect to the variety [\mathfrak{N}_{c_1},\mathfrak{N}_{c_2}], for all c_2\leq c_1\leq 2c_2. As a consequence we determine necessary and sufficient conditions for such groups to be [\mathfrak{N}_{c_1},\mathfrak{N}_{c_2}]-capable. We also show that if c_1\neq 1\neq c_2, then a finitely generated abelian group is [\mathfrak{N}_{c_1},\mathfrak{N}_{c_2}]-capable if and only if it is capable. Finally we show that \mathfrak{S}_2-capability implies capability but there is a finitely generated abelian group which is capable but is not {\mathfrak S}_2-capable.
