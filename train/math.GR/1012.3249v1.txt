Let G be a finite p-group of order p^{n} with |M(G)|=p^{\frac{n(n-1)}{2}-t}, where M(G) is the Schur multiplier of G. Ya.G. Berkovich, X. Zhou, and G. Ellis have determined the structure of G when t=0,1,2,3. In this paper, we are going to find some structures for an abelian p-group G with conditions on the exponents of G, M(G), and S_2M(G), where S_2M(G) is the metabelian multiplier of G.
