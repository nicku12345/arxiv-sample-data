In this paper we present some inequalities for the order, the exponent and the number of generators of the c-nilpotent multiplier (the Baer invariant with respect to the variety of nilpotent groups of class at most c \geq 1) of a finite group and specially of a finite p-group. Our results generalize some previous related results of M.R. Jones and M.R.R. Moghaddam. Also, we show that our results improve some of the previous inequalities.
