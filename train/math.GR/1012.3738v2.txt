For every p-group of order p^n with the derived subgroup of order p^m, Rocco in \cite{roc} has shown that the order of tensor square of G is at most p^{n(n-m)}. In the present paper not only we improve his bound for non-abelian p-groups but also we describe the structure of all non-abelian p-groups when the bound is attained for a special case. Moreover, our results give as well an upper bound for the order of \pi_3(SK(G, 1)).
