A {\it k-involution} is an involution with a fixed point set of codimension k. The conjugacy class of such an involution, denoted S_k, generates \text{M\"ob}(n)-the the group of isometries of hyperbolic n-space-if k is odd, and its orientation preserving subgroup if k is even. In this paper, we supply effective lower and upper bounds for the S_k word length of \text{M\"ob}(n) if k is odd, and the S_k word length of \text{M\"ob}^+(n), if k is even. As a consequence, for a fixed codimension k the length of \text{M\"ob}^{+}(n) with respect to S_k, k even, grows linearly with n with the same statement holding in the odd case. Moreover, the percentage of involution conjugacy classes for which \text{M\"ob}^{+}(n) has length two approaches zero, as n approaches infinity.
