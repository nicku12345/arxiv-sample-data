Let {\cal I}_n be the symmetric inverse semigroup on X_n = \{1, 2,..., n\} and let {\cal DP}_n and {\cal ODP}_n be its subsemigroups of partial isometries and of order-preserving partial isometries of X_n, respectively. In this paper we investigate the cycle structure of a partial isometry and characterize the Green's relations on {\cal DP}_n and {\cal ODP}_n. We show that {\cal ODP}_n is a 0-E-unitary inverse semigroup. We also investigate the cardinalities of some equivalences on {\cal DP}_n and {\cal ODP}_n which lead naturally to obtaining the order of the semigroups.
