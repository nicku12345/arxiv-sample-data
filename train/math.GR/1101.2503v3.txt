In 1998, G. Ellis defined the Schur multiplier of a pair (G,N) of groups and mentioned that this notion is a useful tool for studying pairs of groups. In this paper, we characterize the structure of a pair of finite p-groups (G,N) in terms of the order of the Schur multiplier of (G,N) under some conditions.
