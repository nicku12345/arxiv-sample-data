Let {\cal I}_n be the symmetric inverse semigroup on X_n = \{1, 2,..., n\} and let {\cal DDP}_n and {\cal ODDP}_n be its subsemigroups of order-decreasing partial isometries and of order-preserving order-decreasing partial isometries of X_n, respectively. In this paper we investigate the cycle structure of order-decreasing partial isometry and characterize the Green's relations on {\cal DDP}_n and {\cal ODDP}_n. We show that {\cal ODDP}_n is a 0-E-unitary ample semigroup. We also investigate the cardinalities of some equivalences on {\cal DDP}_n and {\cal ODDP}_n which lead naturally to obtaining the order of the semigroups.
