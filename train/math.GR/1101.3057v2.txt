Recently, Gray and Ruskuc (arXiv:1101.1833) proved that if e is a rank k idempotent transformation of the set {1,...,n} to itself and k<=n-2, then the maximal subgroup of the free idempotent generated semigroup over the full transformation monoid T_n containing e is isomorphic to the symmetric group S_k. We prove that the same holds when T_n is replaced by PT_n, the full monoid of partial transformations on {1,...,n}.
