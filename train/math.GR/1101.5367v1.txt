Let A be a group isomorphic with either S_4, the symmetric group on four symbols, or D_8, the dihedral group of order 8. Let V be a normal four-subgroup of A and \alpha an involution in A\setminus V. Suppose that A acts on a finite group G in such a manner that C_G(V)=1 and C_G(\alpha) has exponent e. We show that if A\cong S_4 then the exponent of G is e-bounded and if A\cong D_8 then the exponent of the derived group G' is e-bounded. This work was motivated by recent results on the exponent of a finite group admitting an action by a Frobenius group of automorphisms.
