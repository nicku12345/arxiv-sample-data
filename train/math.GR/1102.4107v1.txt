It has been proved recently by Moreto and Craven that the order of a finite group is bounded in terms of the largest multiplicity of its irreducible character degrees. A conjugacy class version of this result was proved for solvable groups by Zaikin-Zapirain. In this note, we prove that if G is a finite simple group then the order of G, denoted by |G|, is bounded in terms of the largest multiplicity of its conjugacy class sizes and that if the largest multiplicity of conjugacy class sizes of any quotient of a finite group G is m, then |G| is bounded in terms of m.
