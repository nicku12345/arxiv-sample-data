We introduce a Dehornoy-like ordering of groups, which is a generalization of the Dehornoy ordering of the braid groups. Under a weak assumption which we call Property F, we show that Dehornoy-like orderings have properties similar to the Dehornoy ordering, and produce isolated left orderings. We also construct new examples of Dehornoy-like ordering and isolated orderings and study their more precise properties.
