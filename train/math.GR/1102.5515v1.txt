The article is devoted to linear quasigroups and some of their generalizations. In the first part main definitions and notions of the theory of quasigroups are given. In the second part some elementary properties of linear quasigroups and their generalizations are presented. Finally in the third part endomorphisms and endotopies of linear quasigroups and their generalizations are investigated.
