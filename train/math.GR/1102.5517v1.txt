The article is a continuation of the author's work "Linear quasigroups. I" and devoted to linear quasigroups and some of their generalizations. In the second part identities and linearity of quasigroups are investigated, in particular, the approach of finding quasigroup identities from some variety of loops is presented. Besides that we give short chronology of development the theory of quasigroups and loops and some historical aspects.
