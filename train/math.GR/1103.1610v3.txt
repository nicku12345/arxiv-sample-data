Assume G is a solvable group whose elementary abelian sections are all finite. Suppose, further, that p is a prime such that G fails to contain any subgroups isomorphic to C_{p^\infty}. We show that if G is nilpotent, then the pro-p completion map G\to \hat{G}_p induces an isomorphism H^\ast(\hat{G}_p,M)\to H^\ast(G,M) for any discrete \hat{G}_p-module M of finite p-power order. For the general case, we prove that G contains a normal subgroup N of finite index such that the map H^\ast(\hat{N}_p,M)\to H^\ast(N,M) is an isomorphism for any discrete \hat{N}_p-module M of finite p-power order. Moreover, if G lacks any C_{p^\infty}-sections, the subgroup N enjoys some additional special properties with respect to its pro-p topology.
