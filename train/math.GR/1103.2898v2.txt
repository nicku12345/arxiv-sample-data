Brou\'e, Malle and Rouquier conjectured in that the center of the pure braid group of an irreducible finite complex reflection group is cyclic. We prove this conjecture, for the remaining exceptional types, using the analogous result for the full braid group due to Bessis, and we actually prove the stronger statement that any finite index subgroup of such braid group has cyclic center.
