The main theorem in this article shows that a group of odd order which admits the alternating group of degree 5 with an element of order 5 acting fixed point freely is nilpotent of class at most two. For all odd primes r, other than 5, we give a class two r-group which admits the alternating group of degree 5 in such a way. This theorem corrects an earlier result which asserts that such class two groups do not exist. The result allows us to state a theorem giving precise information about groups in which the centralizer of every element of order 5 has centralizer a 5-group.
