In this paper, we construct a seven-term exact sequence involving the cohomology groups of a group extension. Although the existence of such a sequence can be derived using spectral sequence arguments, there is little knowledge about some of the maps occuring in the sequence, limiting its usefulness. Here we present a construction using only very elementary tools, always related to the notion of conjugation in a group. This results in a complete and usable description of all the maps, which we describe both on cocycle level as on the level of the interpretations of low dimensional cohomology groups (e.g. group extensions).
