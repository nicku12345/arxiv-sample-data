We investigate the influence of the intersection of the \cal F-maximal subgroups on the structure of a finite group. In particular, answering a question of L.A Shemetkov we give conditions under which a hereditary saturated formation \cal F has a property that for any finite group G, the {\cal F}-hypercentre of G coincides with the intersection of all \cal F-maximal subgroups of G.
