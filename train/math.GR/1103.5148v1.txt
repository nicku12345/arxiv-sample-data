In this article, we present an explicit formula for the cth nilpotent multiplier (the Baer invariant with respect to the variety of nilpotent groups of class at most c\geq 1) of the nth nilpotent product of some cyclic groups G={\mathbb {Z}}\stackrel{n}{*} ... \stackrel{n}{*}{\mathbb {Z}}\stackrel{n}{*} {\mathbb {Z}}_{r_1}\stackrel{n}{*} ... \stackrel{n}{*}{\mathbb{Z}}_{r_t}, (m-copies of \mathbb {Z}), where r_{i+1} | r_i for 1 \leq i \leq t-1 and c \geq n such that  (p,r_1)=1 for all primes p less than or equal to n. Also, we compute the polynilpotent multiplier of the group G with respect to the polynilpotent variety {\mathcal N}_{c_1,c_2,...,c_t}, where c_1 \geq n.
