Let {\cal N}_{c_1,...,c_t} be the variety of polynilpotent groups of class row (c_1,...,c_t). In this paper, first, we show that a polynilpotent group G of class row (c_1,...,c_t) has no any {\cal N}_{c_1,...,c_t,c_{t+1}}-covering group if its Baer-invariant with respect to the variety {\cal N}_{c_1,...,c_t,c_{t+1}} is nontrivial. As an immediate consequence, we can conclude that a solvable group G of length c with nontrivial solvable multiplier, {\cal S}_nM(G), has no {\cal S}_n-covering group for all n>c, where {\cal S}_n is the variety of solvable groups of length at most n. Second, we prove that if G is a polynilpotent group of class row (c_1,...,c_t,c_{t+1}) such that {\cal N}_{c'_1,...,c'_t,c'_{t+1}}M(G)\neq 1, where c'_i\geq c_i for all 1\leq i\leq t and c'_{t+1}>c_{t+1}, then G has no any {\cal N}_{c'_1,...,c'_t,c'_{t+1}}-covering group. This is a vast generalization of the first author's result on nilpotent covering groups (Indian\ J.\ Pure\ Appl.\ Math.\ 29(7)\ 711-713,\ 1998).
