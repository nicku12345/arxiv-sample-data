In this paper, we present an explicit formula for the Baer invariant of a finitely generated abelian group with respect to the variety of polynilpotent groups of class row (c_1,...,c_t), {\cal N}_{c_1,...,c_t}. In particular, one can obtain an explicit structure of the \ell-solvable multiplier (the Baer invariant with respect to the vaiety of solvable groups of length at most \ell\geq 1,\ {\cal S}_{\ell}.) of a finitely generated abelian group.
