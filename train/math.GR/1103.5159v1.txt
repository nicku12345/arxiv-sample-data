In this paper, we present an explicit structure for the Baer invariant of a free nilpotent group (the n-th nilpotent product of the infinite cyclic group, \textbf{Z}\st{n}* \textbf{Z}\st{n}*... \st{n}*\textbf{Z}) with respect to the variety of polynilpotent groups of class row (c,1), {\cal N}_{c,1}, for all c > 2n-2. In particular, an explicit structure of the Baer invariant of a free abelian group with respect to the variety of metabelian groups will be presented.
