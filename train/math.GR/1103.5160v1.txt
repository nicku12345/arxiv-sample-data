W. Haebich (1977, Journal of Algebra {\bf 44}, 420-433) presented some formulas for the Schur multiplier of a semidirect product and also a verbal wreath product of two groups. The author (1997, Indag. Math., (N.S.), {\bf 8}({\bf 4}), 529-535) generalized a theorem of W. Haebich to the Baer invariant of a semidirect product of two groups with respect to the variety of nilpotent groups of class at most c\geq 1,\ {\cal N}_c. In this paper, first, it is shown that {\cal V}M(B) and {\cal V}M(A) are direct factors of {\cal V}M(G), where G=B\rhd<A is the semidirect product of a normal subgroup A and a subgroup B and \cal V is an arbitrary variety. Second, it is proved that {\cal N}_cM(B\rhd<A) has some homomorphic images of Haebich's type. Also some formulas of Haebich's type is given for {\cal N}_cM(B\rhd<A), when B and A are cyclic groups.   Third, we will present a formula for the Baer invariant of a \cal V-verbal wreath product of two groups with respect to the variety of nilpotent groups of class at most c\geq 1, where \cal V is an arbitrary variety. Moreover, it is tried to improve this formula, when G=A{\it Wr_V}B and B is cyclic.   Finally, a structure for the Baer invariant of a free wreath product with respect to {\cal N}_c will be presented, specially for the free wreath product A{\it Wr_*}B where B is a cyclic group.
