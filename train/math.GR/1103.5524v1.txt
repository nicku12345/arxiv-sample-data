A new infinite family of bipartite cubic 3-arc transitive graphs is constructed and studied. They provide the first known examples admitting a 2-arc transitive vertex-biquasiprimitive group of automorphisms for which the index two subgroup fixing each half of the bipartition is not quasiprimitive on either bipartite half.
