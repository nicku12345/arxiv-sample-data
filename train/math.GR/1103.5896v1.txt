In this paper, we are going to look at the c-nilpotent multiplier of a group G, {\cal N}_cM(G), as a functor from the category of all groups, {\cal G}roup, to the category of all abelian groups, {\cal A}b, and focusing on some functional properties of it. In fact, by using some results of the first author and others and finding an explicit formula for the c-nilpotent multiplier of a finitely generated abelian group, we try to concentrate on the commutativity of the above functor with the two famous functors Ext and Tor.
