In this paper, using a result of J. Burns and G. Ellis (Math. Z. 226 (1997) 405-28.), we prove that the c-nilpotent multiplier (the Baer-invariant with respect to the variety of nilpotent groups of class at most c, {\cal N}_c.) {\it does commute} with the free product of cyclic groups of mutually coprime order.
