Two natural extensions of Jensen's functional equation on the real line are the equations f(xy)+f(xy^{-1}) = 2f(x) and f(xy)+f(y^{-1}x) = 2f(x), where f is a map from a multiplicative group G into an abelian additive group H. In a series of papers \cite{Ng1}, \cite{Ng2}, \cite{Ng3}, C. T. Ng has solved these functional equations for the case where G is a free group and the linear group GL_n(R), R=\z,\r, a quadratically closed field or a finite field. He has also mentioned, without detailed proof, in the above papers and in \cite{Ng4} that when G is the symmetric group S_n the group of all solutions of these functional equations coincides with the group of all homomorphisms from (S_n,\cdot) to (H,+). The aim of this paper is to give an elementary and direct proof of this fact.
