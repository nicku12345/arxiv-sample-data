Let {\cal N}_c be the variety of nilpotent groups of class at most c\ \ (c\geq 2) and G=Z_r\oplus Z_s  be the direct sum of two finite cyclic groups. It is shown that if the greatest common divisor of r and s is not one, then G does not have any {\cal N}_c-covering group for every c\geq 2. This result gives an idea that Lemma 2 of J.Wiegold [6] and Haebich's Theorem [1], a vast generalization of the Wiegold's Theorem, can {\it not} be generalized to the variety of nilpotent groups of class at most c\geq 2.
