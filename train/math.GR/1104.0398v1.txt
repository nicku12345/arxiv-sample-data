M.R.Jones and J.Wiegold in [3] have shown that if G is a finite group with a subgroup H of finite index n, then the n-th power of Schur multiplier of G, M(G)^n, is isomorphic to a subgroup of M(H).   In this paper we prove a similar result for the centre by centre by w variety of groups, where w is any outer commutator word. Then using a result of M.R.R.Moghaddam [6], we will be able to deduce a result of Schur's type (see [4,9]) with respect to the variety of nilpotent groups of class at most c (c\geq 1), when c+1 is any prime number or 4.
