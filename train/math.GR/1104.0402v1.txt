In 1972 K.I.Tahara [7,2 Theorem 2.2.5], using cohomological method, showed that if a finite group G=T\rhd<N is the semidirect product of a normal subgroup N and a subgroup T, then M(T) is a direct factor of M(G), where M(G) is the Schur-multiplicator of G and in the finite case, is the second cohomology group of G. In 1977 W.Haebich [1 Theorem 1.7] gave another proof using a different method for an arbitrary group G .   In this paper we generalize the above theorem . We will show that {\cal N}_cM(T) is a direct factor of {\cal N}_cM(G), where {\cal N}_c [3 page 102] is the variety of nilpotent groups of class at most c\geq 1 and {\cal N}_cM(G) is {\it the Baer-invariant} of the group G with respect to the variety {\cal N}_c [3 page 107] .
