For every atoroidal iwip automorphism \phi of F_N (i.e. the analogue of a pseudo-Anosov mapping class) it is shown that the algebraic lamination dual to the forward limit tree T_+(\phi) is obtained as "diagonal closure" of the support of the backward limit current \mu_-(\phi). This diagonal closure is obtained through a finite procedure in analogy to adding diagonal leaves from the complementary components to the stable lamination of a pseudo-Anosov homeomorphism. We also give several new characterizations as well as a structure theorem for the dual lamination of T_+(\phi), in terms of Bestvina-Feighn-Handel's "stable lamination" associated to \phi.
