Let K be a non-trivial knot in the 3-sphere, E_K its exterior, G_K = \pi_1(E_K) its group, and P_K = \pi_1(\partial E_K) \subset G_K its peripheral subgroup. We show that P_K is malnormal in G_K, namely that gP_Kg^{-1} \cap P_K = \{e\} for any g \in G_K with g \notin P_K, unless K is in one of the following three classes: torus knots, cable knots, and composite knots; these are exactly the classes for which there exist annuli in E_K attached to T_K which are not boundary parallel (Theorem 1 and Corollary 2). More generally, we characterise malnormal peripheral subgroups in the fundamental group of a compact orientable irreducible 3-manifold with boundary a non-empty union of tori (Theorem 3). Proofs are written with non-expert readers in mind. Half of our paper (Sections 7 to 10) is a reminder of some three-manifold topology as it flourished before the Thurston revolution. In a companion paper [HaWeOs], we collect general facts on malnormal subgroups and Frobenius groups, and we review a number of examples.
