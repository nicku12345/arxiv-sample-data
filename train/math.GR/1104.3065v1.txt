Malnormal subgroups occur in various contexts. We review a large number of examples, and we compare the situation in this generality to that of finite Frobenius groups of permutations. In a companion paper [HaWe], we analyse when peripheral subgroups of knot groups and 3-manifold groups are malnormal.
