We introduce a notion of L^2-Betti numbers for locally compact, second countable, unimodular groups. We study the relation to the standard notion of L^2-Betti numbers of countable discrete groups for lattices. In this way, several new computations are obtained for countable groups, including lattices in algebraic groups over local fields, and Kac-Moody lattices.   We also extend the vanishing of reduced L^2-cohomology for countable amenable groups, a well known theorem due to Cheeger and Gromov, to cover all amenable, second countable, unimodular locally compact groups.
