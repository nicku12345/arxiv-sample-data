Given a sequence of (G_i)_{i \in \N} of finite transitive groups of degree n_i, let W_\infty be the inverse limit of the iterated permutational wreath products of the first m groups. We prove that W_\infty is (topologically) finitely generated if and only if \prod_{i=1}^{\infty} (G_i/G_i') is finitely generated and the growth of the minimal number of generators of G_i is bounded by  d...n_1...n_{i-1} for a constant d. Moreover we give a criterion to decide whether W_\infty is positively finitely generated.
