We apply the techniques of symmetric generation to establish the standard presentations of the finite simply laced irreducible finite Coxeter groups, that is the Coxeter groups of types An, Dn and En, and show that these are naturally arrived at purely through consideration of certain natural actions of symmetric groups. We go on to use these techniques to provide explicit representations of these groups.
