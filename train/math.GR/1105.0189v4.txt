We define a family of groups that generalises Thompson's groups T and G and also those of Higman, Stein and Brin. For groups in this family we descrine centralisers of finite subgroups and show, that for a given finite subgroup Q, there are finitely many conjugacy classes of finite subgroups isomorphic to Q. We use this to show that whenever defined, the T versions of these groups have a slightly weaker property, quasi-\underline{\operatorname F}_\infty, to that of a group possessing a finite type model for the classifying space for proper actions {\underline{E}}G if and only if they posses finite type models for the ordinary classifying space. We also generalise some well-known properties of ordinary cohomology to Bredon cohomology.
