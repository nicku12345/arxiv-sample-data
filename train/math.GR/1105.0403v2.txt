We will show that all inverse limits of finite rank free groups index by the natural numbers are isomorphic either to a finite rank free group or to a fixed universal group. In other words, any inverse system of finite rank free groups which is not equivalent to an eventually constant system has the universal group as its limit. This universal inverse limit is naturally isomorphic to the first shape group of the Hawaiian earring. We also give an example of a homomorphic image of a Hawaiian earring group which lies in the inverse limit of free groups but is neither a free group nor a Hawaiian earring group.
