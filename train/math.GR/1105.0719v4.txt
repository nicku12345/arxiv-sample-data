In the paper we discuss the algebraic structure of topological full group [[T]] of a Cantor minimal system (X,T). We show that the topological full group [[T]] has the structure similar to a union of permutational wreath products of group \mathbb Z. This allows us to prove that the topological full groups are locally embeddable into finite groups; give an elmentary proof of the fact that group [[T]]' is infinitely presented; and provide explicit examples of maximal locally finite subgroups of [[T]]. We also show that the commutator subgroup [[T]]', which is simple and finitely-generated for minimal subshifts, is decomposable into a product of two locally finite groups and that the groups [[T]] and [[T]]' possess continuous ergodic invariant random subgroups.
