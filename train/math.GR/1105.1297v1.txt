For a finitely generated group \Gamma denote by \mu(\Gamma) the growth coefficient of \Gamma, that is, the infimum over all real numbers d such that s_n(\Gamma)<n!^d. We show that the growth coefficient of a virtually free group is always rational, and that every rational number occurs as growth coefficient of some virtually free group. Moreover, we describe an algorithm to compute \mu.
