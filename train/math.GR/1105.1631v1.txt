We construct for d\geq 2 and \epsilon>0 a d-generated p-group \Gamma, which in an asymptotic sense behaves almost like a d-generated free pro-p-group. We show that a subgroup of index p^n needs (d-\epsilon)p^n generators, and that the subgroup growth of \Gamma satisfies s_{p^n}(\Gamma)>s_{p^n}(F_d^p)^{1-\epsilon}, where F_d^p is the d-generated free pro-p-group. To do so we introduce a new invariant for finitely generated groups and study some of its basic properties.
