This article is devoted to present an explicit formula for the cth nilpotent multiplier of nilpotent products of some cyclic groups G={\bf {Z}}\stackrel{n_1}{*}{\bf {Z}}\stackrel{n_2}{*}...\stackrel{n_{t-1}}{*}{\bf {Z}}\stackrel{n_{t}}{*} {\bf {Z}}_{m_{t+1}}\stackrel{n_{t+1}}{*}{\bf {Z}}_{m_{t+2}}\stackrel{n_{t+2}}{*}...\stackrel{n_{k}}{*}{\bf{Z}}_{m_{k+1}}, where m_{i+1} | m_i for all t+1 \leq i \leq k and c \geq n_1\geq n_2\geq ...\geq n_t\geq ...\geq n_{k} such that  (p,m_{t+1})=1 for all prime p \leq n_1. Moreover, we compute the polynilpotent multiplier of the group G with respect to the polynilpotent variety {\mathcal N}_{c_1,c_2,...,c_s}, where c_1 \geq n_1.
