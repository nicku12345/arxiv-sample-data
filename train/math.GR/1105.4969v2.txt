Let G be a finitely generated torsion-free nilpotent group and \phi:H\rightarrow G be a surjective homomorphism from a subgroup H<G of finite index with trivial \phi-core. For every choice of coset representatives of H in G there is a faithful self-similar action of the group G associated with (G,\phi). We are interested in what cases all these actions are finite-state and in what cases there exists a finite-state self-similar action for (G,\phi). These two properties are characterized in terms of the Jordan normal form of the corresponding automorphism \widehat{\phi} of the Lie algebra of the Mal'cev completion of G.
