Let G be a finite non-abelian p-group, where p is a prime. Let \mathrm{Aut}_c(G) and \mathrm{Aut}_z(G) respectively denote the group of all class preserving and central automorphisms of G. We give a necessary condition for G such that \mathrm{Aut}_c(G)=\mathrm{Aut}_z(G) and give necessary and sufficient conditions for G with elementary abelian or cyclic center such that \mathrm{Aut}_c(G)=\mathrm{Aut}_z(G). We also characterize all finite p-groups G of order \leq p^7 such that \mathrm{Aut}_c(G)=\mathrm{Aut}_z(G) and complete the classification of all finite p-groups of order \le p^5 for which there exist non-inner class preserving automorphisms.
