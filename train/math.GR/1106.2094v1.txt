We show that no left-ordering on a free product of (left-orderable) groups is isolated. In particular, we show that the space of left-orderings of free product of finitely generated groups is homeomorphic to the Cantor set. With the same techniques, we also give a new and constructive proof of the fact that the natural conjugation action of the free group (on two or more generators) on its space of left-orderings has a dense orbit.
