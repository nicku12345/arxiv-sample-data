We consider a rank one group G = \langle A,B \rangle  which acts cubically on a module V, this means [V,A,A,A] =0 but [V,G,G,G] \ne 0. We have to distinguish whether the group A_0 :=C_A([V,A]) \cap C_A(V/C_V(A)) is trivial or not. We show that if A_0 is trivial, G is a rank one group associated to a quadratic Jordan division algebra. If A_0 is not trivial (which is always the case if A is not abelian), then A_0 defines a subgroup G_0 of G which acts quadratically on V. We will call G_0 the \textit{quadratic kernel} of G. By a result of Timmesfeld we have G_0 \cong \SL_2(J,R) for a ring R and a special quadratic Jordan division algebra J \subseteq R. We show that J is either a Jordan algebra contained in a commutative field or a hermitian Jordan algebra. In the second case G is the special unitary group of a pseudo-quadratic form \pi of Witt index 1, in the first case G is the rank one group for a Freudenthal triple system. These results imply that if (V,G) is a quadratic pair such that no two distinct root groups commute and \characteristic V\ne 2,3, then G is a unitary group or an exceptional algebraic group.
