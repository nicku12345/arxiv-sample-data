By a result of Sharma, right Bol quasigroups are obtainable from right Bol loops via an involutive automorphism. We prove that the class of AG-groups, introduced by Kamran, is obtained via the same construction from abelian groups. We further introduce a new class of Bol* quasigroups, which turns out to correspond, as above, to the class of groups.   Sharma's correspondence allows an efficient implementation and we present some enumeration results for the above three classes.
