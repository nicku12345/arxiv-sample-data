Recently, Schlage-Puchta proved super multiplicity of p-deficiency for normal subgroups of p-power index. We extend this result to all normal subgroups of finite index. We then use the methods of the proof to show that some groups with non-positive p-deficiency have virtually positive p-deficiency. We also compute the p-deficiency in some cases such as Fuchsian groups and study related invariants: the lower and upper absolute p-homology gradients and the p-Euler characteristic.
