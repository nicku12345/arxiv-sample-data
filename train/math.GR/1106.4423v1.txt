We show that the group constructed in the 2004 paper 'A 2-generated just-infinite profinite group which is not positively finitely generated' by A. Lucchini is in fact hereditarily just infinite and contains every countably based profinite group as a closed subgroup. Lucchini's paper predates some related work of J. Wilson.
