This is the second paper in a series of three, where we take on the unified theory of non-Archimedean group actions, length functions and infinite words. Here, for an arbitrary group G of infinite words over an ordered abelian group \Lambda we construct a \Lambda-tree \Gamma_G equipped with a free action of G. Moreover, we show that \Gamma_G is a universal tree for G in the sense that it isometrically embeds in every \Lambda-tree equipped with a free G-action compatible with the original length function on G.
