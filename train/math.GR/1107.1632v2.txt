For every \alpha \leq \beta in a left neighborhood [\alpha_0,1] of 1, a group G(\alpha,\beta) is constructed, the growth function of which satisfies \limsup \frac{\log \log b_{G(\alpha,\beta)}(r)}{\log r}=\alpha and \liminf \frac{\log \log b_{G(\alpha,\beta)}(r)}{\log r}=\beta. When \alpha=\beta, this provides an explicit uncountable collection of groups with growth functions strictly comparable. On the other hand, oscillation in the case \alpha < \beta explains the existence of groups with non comparable growth functions. Some period exponents associated to the frequency of oscillation provide new group invariants.
