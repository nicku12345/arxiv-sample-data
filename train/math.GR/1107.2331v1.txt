We begin a study of a pro-p analogue of limit groups via extensions of centralizers and call \mathcal{L} this new class of pro-p groups. We show that the pro-p groups of \mathcal{L} have finite cohomological dimension, type FP_{\infty} and non-positive Euler characteristic. Among the group theoretic properties it is proved that they are free-by-(torsion-free poly -procyclic) and if non-abelian do not have a finitely generated non-trivial normal subgroup of infinite index. Furthermore it is shown that every 2 generated pro-p group in the class \mathcal{L} is either free pro-p or abelian.
