We analyse the subgroup structure of direct products of groups. Earlier work on this topic has revealed that higher finiteness properties play a crucial role in determining which groups appear as subgroups of direct products of free groups or limit groups. Here, we seek to relate the finiteness properties of a subgroup to the way it is embedded in the ambient product. To this end we formulate a conjecture on finiteness properties of fibre products of groups. We present different approaches to this conjecture, proving a general result on finite generation of homology groups of fibre products and, for certain special cases, results on the stronger finiteness properties F_n and FP_n.
