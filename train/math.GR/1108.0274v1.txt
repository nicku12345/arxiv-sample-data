The main result of [4] is that all finitely presented groups of p-deficiency greater than one are p-large. Here we prove that groups with a finite presentation of p-deficiency one possess a finite index subgroup that surjects onto . This implies that these groups do not have Kazhdan's property (T). Additionally, we prove that the main result of [4] implies a result of Lackenby [8].
