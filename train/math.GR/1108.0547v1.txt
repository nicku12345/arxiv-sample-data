If G is a finitely generated powerful pro-p group satisfying a certain law v=1, and if G can be generated by a normal subset T of finite width which satisfies a positive law, we prove that G is nilpotent. Furthermore, the nilpotency class of G can be bounded in terms of the prime p, the number of generators of G, the law v=1, the width of T, and the degree of the positive law. The main interest of this result is the application to verbal subgroups: if G is a p-adic analytic pro-p group in which all values of a word w satisfy positive law, and if the verbal subgroup w(G) is powerful, then w(G) is nilpotent.
