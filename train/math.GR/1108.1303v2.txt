Recently, two first authors have introduced a group invariant, which is related to the number of elements x and y of a finite group G such that x\wedge y=1 in the exterior square G\wedge G of G. Research on this probability gives some relations between the concept and Schur multiplier and the capability of finite groups. In the present paper, we will generalize the concept of exterior degree of groups and we will introduce the multiple exterior degree of finite groups. Among the other results, we will state some results between the multiple exterior degree, multiple commutativity degree and capability of finite groups.
