By calculating the symmetric subgroups \Aut(\fru_0)^{\theta} and their involution classes, we classify the Klein four subgroups \Gamma of \Aut(\fru_0) for each compact simple Lie algebra \fru_0 up to conjugation. This leads to a new approach of classification of semisimple symmetric pairs and \bbZ_2\times \bbZ_2-symmetric spaces. We also determine the fixed point subgroup \Aut(\fru_0)^\Gamma.
