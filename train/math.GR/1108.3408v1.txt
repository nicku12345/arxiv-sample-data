In this paper, we investigate dual 3-nets realizing the groups C_3 \times C_3, C_2 \times C_4, \Alt_4 and that can be embedded in a projective plane PG(2,\mathbb K), where \mathbb K is an algebraically closed field. We give a symbolically verifiable computational proof that every dual 3-net realizing the groups C_3 \times C_3 and C_2 \times C_4 is algebraic, namely, that its points lie on a plane cubic. Moreover, we present two computer programs whose calculations show that the group \Alt_4 cannot be realized if the characteristic of \mathbb K is zero.
