Let G be a group with involution * and \sigma\colon G\to\{\pm1\} a group homomorphism. The map \sharp that sends \alpha=\sum\alpha_gg in a group ring RG to \alpha^{\sharp}=\sum\sigma(g)\alpha_gg^* is an involution of RG called an \emph{oriented group involution}. An element \alpha\in RG is \emph{symmetric} if \alpha^{\sharp}=\alpha and \emph{skew-symmetric} if \alpha^{\sharp}=-\alpha. The sets of symmetric and skew-symmetric elements have received a lot of attention in the special cases that * is the inverse map on G and/or \sigma is identically 1, but not in general. In this paper, we determine the conditions under which the sets of elements that are symmetric and skew-symmetric, respectively, relative to a general oriented involution form subrings of RG. The work on symmetric elements is a modification and correction of previous work.
