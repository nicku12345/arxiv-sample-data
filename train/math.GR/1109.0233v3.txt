We prove that the reduced Kurosh rank of the intersection of two subgroups H and K of a free product of right-orderable groups is bounded above by the product of the reduced Kurosh ranks of H and K.   In particular, taking the fundamental group of a graph of groups with trivial vertex and edge groups, and its Bass-Serre tree, our Theorem becomes the desired inequality of the usual Strengthened Hanna Neumann conjecture for free groups.
