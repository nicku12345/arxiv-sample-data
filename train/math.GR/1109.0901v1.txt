Let k_1,k_2 be two fields of characteristic 0. Let G_1 be a split semisimple algebraic group over k_1, G_2 a split Kac--Moody group over k_2 and \phi\colon G_1(k_1)\to G_2(k_2) an abstract embedding. We show that \im \phi is a bounded subgroup whenever k_1 is an algebraic extension of the rational numbers, while there are embeddings with unbounded image if k_1 has infinite transcendence degree over the rational numbers.
