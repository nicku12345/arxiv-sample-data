We study abstract finite groups with the property, called property \hat{s}, that all of their subrepresentations have submultiplicative spectra. Such groups are necessarily nilpotent and we focus on p-groups. p-groups with property \hat{s} are regular. Hence, a 2-group has property \hat{s} if and only if it is commutative. For an odd prime p, all p-abelian groups have property \hat{s}, in particular all groups of exponent p have it. We show that a 3-group or a metabelian p-group (p \ge 5) has property \hat{s} if and only if it is V-regular.
