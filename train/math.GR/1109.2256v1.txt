Let G be a finite group. For all a \in \Z, such that (a,|G|)=1, the function \rho_a: G \to G sending g to g^a defines a permutation of the elements of G. Motivated by a recent generalization of Zolotarev's proof of classic quadratic reciprocity, due to Duke and Hopkins, we study the signature of the permutation \rho_a. By introducing the group of conjugacy equivariant maps and the symmetric difference method on groups, we exhibit an integer d_{G} such that \text{sgn}(\rho_a)=(\frac{d_G}{a}) for all G in a large class of groups, containing all finite nilpotent and odd order groups.
