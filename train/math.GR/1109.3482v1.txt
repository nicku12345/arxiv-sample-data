This note describes a unified approach to several superrigidity results, old and new, concerning representations of lattices into simple algebraic groups over local fields. For an arbitrary group \Gamma and a \Gamma-boundary B we associate certain generalized Weyl group W_{\Gamma,B} and show that any representation with a Zariski dense unbounded image in a simple algebraic group, \rho:\Gamma\to \mathbf{H}, defines a special homomorphism W_{\Gamma,B}\to {\rm Weyl}(\mathbf{H}). This general fact allows to deduce the aforementioned superrigidity results.
