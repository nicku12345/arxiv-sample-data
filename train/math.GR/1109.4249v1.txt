In a recent paper, Gabriel Navarro and Pham Huu Tiep show that the so-called Alperin Weight Conjecture can be verified via the Classification of the Finite Simple Groups, provided any simple group fulfills a very precise list of conditions. Our purpose here is to show to the interested reader that the results in our book "Frobenius categories versus Brauer blocks", Progress in Math. 274(2009), and the reduction arguments in "On the reduction of Alperin's Conjecture to the quasi-simple groups", J. of Algebra 328(2011), suggest a numerical statement - implying Alperin's Conjecture block by block - which can be reduced again to check that the same holds on the quasi-simple groups and, this time, this statement on the quasi-simple groups follows from the list of conditions demanded by Navarro and Tiep.
