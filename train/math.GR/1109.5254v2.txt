In the 1960's Noboru Iwahori and Hideya Matsumoto, Eiichi Abe and Kazuo Suzuki, and Michael Stein discovered that Chevalley groups G=G(\Phi,R) over a semilocal ring admit remarkable Gauss decomposition G=TUU^-U, where T=T(\Phi,R) is a split maximal torus, whereas U=U(\Phi,R) and U^-=U^-(\Phi,R) are unipotent radicals of two opposite Borel subgroups B=B(\Phi,R) and B^-=B^-(\Phi,R) containing T. It follows from the classical work of Hyman Bass and Michael Stein that for classical groups Gauss decomposition holds under weaker assumptions such as \sr(R)=1 or \asr(R)=1. Later the second author noticed that condition \sr(R)=1 is necessary for Gauss decomposition. Here, we show that a slight variation of Tavgen's rank reduction theorem implies that for the elementary group E(\Phi,R) condition \sr(R)=1 is also sufficient for Gauss decomposition. In other words, E=HUU^-U, where H=H(\Phi,R)=T\cap E. This surprising result shows that stronger conditions on the ground ring, such as being semi-local, \asr(R)=1, \sr(R,\Lambda)=1, etc., were only needed to guarantee that for simply connected groups G=E, rather than to verify the Gauss decomposition itself.
