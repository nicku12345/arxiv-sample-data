For a prime p, a p-subgroup of a finite group G is said to be large if and only if Q= F^*(N_G(Q)) and, for all 1 \neq U \le Z(Q), N_G(U) \le N_G(Q). In this article we determine those groups G which have a large subgroup and which in addition have a proper subgroup H containing a Sylow p-subgroup of G with F^*(H) a group of Lie type in characteristic p and rank at least 2 (excluding \PSL_3(p^a)) and C_H(z) soluble for some z \in Z(S). This work is part of a project to determine the groups G which contain a large p-subgroup.
