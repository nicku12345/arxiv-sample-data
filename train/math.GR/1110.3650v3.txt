We show that there exists a finitely generated group of growth ~f for all functions f:\mathbb{R}\rightarrow\mathbb{R} satisfying f(2R) \leq f(R)^{2} \leq f(\eta R) for all R large enough and \eta\approx2.4675 the positive root of X^{3}-X^{2}-2X-4. This covers all functions that grow uniformly faster than \exp(R^{\log2/\log\eta}).   We also give a family of self-similar branched groups of growth ~\exp(R^\alpha) for a dense set of \alpha\in(\log2/\log\eta,1).
