This article generalizes two approaches for property (T) - the first is a generalization of Zuk's criterion for property (T) and the second is a generalization of the work of Kassabov regarding property (T) and subspace arrangements. In both cases we obtain new criteria for property (T) (and for vanishing of higher L2-cohomologies).
