We introduce the space function s(n) of a finitely presented semigroup S =<A\mid R>. To define s(n) we consider pairs of words w,w' over A of length at most n equal in S and use relations from R for the transformations w=w_0\to...\to w_t= w'; s(n) bounds from above the tape space (or computer memory) sufficient to implement all such transitions w\to...\to w'. One of the results obtained is the following criterion: A finitely generated semigroup S has decidable word problem of polynomial space complexity if and only if S is a subsemigroup of a finitely presented semigroup H with polynomial space function.
