In the paper we study inverse semigroups \mathscr{B}(G), \mathscr{B}^+(G), \bar{\mathscr{B}}(G) and \bar{\mathscr{B}}\,^+(G) which are generated by partial monotone injective translations of a positive cone of a linearly ordered group G. We describe Green's relations on the semigroups \mathscr{B}(G), \mathscr{B}^+(G), \bar{\mathscr{B}}(G) and \bar{\mathscr{B}}\,^+(G), their bands and show that they are simple, and moreover the semigroups \mathscr{B}(G) and \mathscr{B}^+(G) are bisimple. We show that for a commutative linearly ordered group G all non-trivial congruences on the semigroup \mathscr{B}(G) (and \mathscr{B}^+(G)) are group congruences if and only if the group G is archimedean. Also we describe the structure of group congruences on the semigroups \mathscr{B}(G), \mathscr{B}^+(G), \bar{\mathscr{B}}(G) and \bar{\mathscr{B}}\,^+(G).
