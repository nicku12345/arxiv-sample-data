We say that a group G is a cube group if it is generated by a set S of involutions such that the corresponding Cayley graph Cay(G,S) is isomorphic to a cube. Equivalently, G is a cube group if it acts on a cube such that the action is simply-transitive on the vertices and the edge stabilizers are all nontrivial. The action on the cube extends to an orthogonal linear action, which we call the geometric representation. We prove a combinatorial decomposition for cube groups into products of 2-element subgroup, and show that the geometric representation is always reducible.
