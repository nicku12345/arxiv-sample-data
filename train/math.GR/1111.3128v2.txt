Let for a prime p, \mathfrak{X} (respectively \mathfrak{Y}) be the class of all p-biprimitively finite (respectively periodic p-conjugatively biprimitively finite) groups and G\in \mathfrak{X} (respectively G\in \mathfrak{Y}), V be a periodic subgroup of G having an ascending series of normal in G subgroups such that each its factor is an almost layer-finite group or a locally graded group of finite special rank, or a WF-group with min-q on all primes q. We prove that G/V \in \mathfrak{X} (respectively G/V\in \mathfrak{Y}). Also some interesting and useful preliminary results are obtained.
