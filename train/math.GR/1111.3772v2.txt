For a discrete group \Gamma satisfying some finiteness conditions we give a Bredon projective resolution of the trivial module in terms of projective covers of the chain complex associated to certain posets of subgroups. We use this to give new results on dimensions of E\gamma and to reprove that for virtually solvable groups, \underline{\cd}\Gamma=\vcd\Gamma. We also deduce a formula to compute the Euler class of E\gamma for \Gamma virtually solvable of type \FP_\infty and use it to compute orbifold Euler characteristics.
