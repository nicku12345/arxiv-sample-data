We describe an algorithm that uses Stallings' folding technique to decompose an element of Aut(F_n) as a product of Whitehead automorphisms (and hence as a product of Nielsen transformations.) We use this to give an alternative method of finding a finite generating set for the subgroup of Aut(F_n) that fixes a subset Y of the basis elements, and the subgroup that fixes each element of Y up to conjugacy. We show that the intersection of this latter subgroup with IA_n is also finitely generated.
