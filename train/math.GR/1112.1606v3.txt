Let m, m', r, r',t, t' be positive integers with r, r' \ge 2. Let L_r denote the ring that is universal with an invertible 1 \times r matrix. Let M_m(L_r^{\otimes t}) denote the ring of m \times m matrices over the tensor product of t copies of L_r. In a natural way, M_m(L_r^{\otimes t}) is a partially ordered ring with involution. Let PU_m(L_r^{\otimes t}) denote the group of positive unitary elements. We show that PU_m(L_r^{\otimes t}) is isomorphic to the Brin-Higman-Thompson group t V_{r,m}; the case t =1 was found by Pardo, that is, PU_m(L_r) is isomorphic to the Higman-Thompson group V_{r,m}. We survey arguments of Abrams, \'Anh, Bleak, Brin, Higman, Lanoue, Pardo, and Thompson that prove that t' V_{r',m'} \cong tV_{r,m}  if and only if r' = r, t'=t and  \gcd(m',r'-1) = \gcd(m,r-1) (if and only if M_{m'}(L_{r'}^{\otimes t'}) and M_m(L_r^{\otimes t}) are isomorphic as partially ordered rings with involution).
