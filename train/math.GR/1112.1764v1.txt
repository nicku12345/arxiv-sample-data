In this note we look at presentations of subgroups of finitely presented groups with infinite cyclic quotients. We prove that if H is a finitely generated normal subgroup of a finitely presented group G with G/H cyclic, then H has ascending finite endomorphic presentation. It follows that any finitely presented indicable group without free semigroups has the structure of a semidirect product H \rtimes \field{Z} where H has finite ascending endomorphic presentation.
