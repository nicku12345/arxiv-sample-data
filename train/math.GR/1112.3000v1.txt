If a black box group is known to be isomorphic to an exceptional simple group of Lie type of (twisted) rank >1, other than any ^2F_4(q), over a field of known size, a Las Vegas algorithm is given to produce a constructive isomorphism. In view of its timing, this algorithm yields an upgrade of all known nearly linear time Monte Carlo permutation group algorithms to Las Vegas algorithms when the input group has no composition factor isomorphic to any group ^2F_4(q) or ^2G_2(q).
