If G is a solvable group and p is a prime, then the Fong-Swan theorem shows that given any irreducible Brauer character \phi of G, there exists a character \chi \in \irrg such that \chi^o = \phi, where ^o denotes the restriction of \chi to the p-regular elements of G. We say that \chi is a {\it{lift}} of \phi in this case. It is known that if \phi is in a block with abelian defect group D, then the number of lifts of \phi is bounded above by |D|. In this paper we give a necessary and sufficient condition for this bound to be achieved, in terms of local information in a subgroup V determined by the block B. We also apply these methods to examine the situation when equality occurs in the k(B) conjecture for blocks of solvable groups with abelian defect group.
