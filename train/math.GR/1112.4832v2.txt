We initiate the study of affine actions of groups on \Lambda-trees for a general ordered abelian group \Lambda; these are actions by dilations rather than isometries. This gives a common generalisation of isometric action on a \Lambda-tree, and affine action on an \R-tree as studied by I. Liousse. The duality between based length functions and actions on \Lambda-trees is generalised to this setting. We are led to consider a new class of groups: those that admit a free affine action on a \Lambda-tree for some \Lambda. Examples of such groups are presented, including soluble Baumslag-Solitar groups and the discrete Heisenberg group.
