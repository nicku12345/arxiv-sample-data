Let G be a finite group and H a subgroup of G. Each left transversal (with identity) of H in G has a left loop (left quasigroup with identity) structure induced by the binary operation of G. We say two left transversals are isomorphic if they are isomorphic with respect to the induced left loop structures. In this paper, we develop a method to calculate the number of isomorphism classes of transversals of H in G. Also with the help of this we calculate the number of non-isomorphic left loops of a given order.
