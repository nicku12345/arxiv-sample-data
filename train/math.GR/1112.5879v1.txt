For a family of group words w we show that if G is a profinite group in which all w-values are contained in a union of finitely many subgroups with a prescribed property, then w(G) has the same property as well. In particular, we show this in the case where the subgroups are periodic or of finite rank. If G contains finitely many subgroups G_1,G_2,...,G_s of finite exponent e whose union contains all \gamma_k-values in G, it is shown that \gamma_k(G) has finite (e,k,s)-bounded exponent. If G contains finitely many subgroups G_1,G_2,...,G_s of finite rank r whose union contains all \gamma_k-values, it is shown that \gamma_k(G) has finite (k,r,s)-bounded rank.
