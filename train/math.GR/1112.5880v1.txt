Let A be an elementary abelian group of order p^{k} with k\geq 3 acting on a finite p'-group G. The following results are proved.   If \gamma_{k-2}(C_{G}(a)) is nilpotent of class at most c for any a\in A^{#}, then \gamma_{k-2}(G) is nilpotent and has \{c,k,p\}-bounded nilpotency class.   If, for some integer d such that 2^{d}+2\leq k, the dth derived group of C_{G}(a) is nilpotent of class at most c for any a\in A^{#}, then the dth derived group G^{(d)} is nilpotent and has \{c,k,p\}-bounded nilpotency class.   Earlier this was known only in the case where k\leq 4.
