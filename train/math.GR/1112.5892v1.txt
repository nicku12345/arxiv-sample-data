For a finite group G let \sigma(G) (the "sum" of G) be the least number of proper subgroups of G whose set-theoretical union is equal to G, and \sigma(G)=\infty if G is cyclic. We say that a group G is \sigma-elementary if for every non-trivial normal subgroup N of G we have \sigma(G)<\sigma(G/N). In this paper we produce the list of all the \sigma-elementary groups of sum up to 25. We also show that \sigma(\Aut(PSL(2,8)))=29.
