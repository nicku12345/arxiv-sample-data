In the paper we study the semigroup \mathscr{C}_{\mathbb{Z}} which is a generalization of the bicyclic semigroup. We describe main algebraic properties of the semigroup \mathscr{C}_{\mathbb{Z}} and prove that every non-trivial congruence \mathfrak{C} on the semigroup \mathscr{C}_{\mathbb{Z}} is a group congruence, and moreover the quotient semigroup \mathscr{C}_{\mathbb{Z}}/\mathfrak{C} is isomorphic to a cyclic group. Also we show that the semigroup \mathscr{C}_{\mathbb{Z}} as a Hausdorff semitopological semigroup admits only the discrete topology. Next we study the closure \operatorname{cl}_T(\mathscr{C}_{\mathbb{Z}}) of the semigroup \mathscr{C}_{\mathbb{Z}} in a topological semigroup T. We show that the non-empty remainder of \mathscr{C}_{\mathbb{Z}} in a topological inverse semigroup T consists of a group of units H(1_T) of T and a two-sided ideal I of T in the case when H(1_T)\neq\varnothing and I\neq\varnothing. In the case when T is a locally compact topological inverse semigroup and I\neq\varnothing we prove that an ideal I is topologically isomorphic to the discrete additive group of integers and describe the topology on the subsemigroup \mathscr{C}_{\mathbb{Z}}\cup I. Also we show that if the group of units H(1_T) of the semigroup T is non-empty, then H(1_T) is either singleton or H(1_T) is topologically isomorphic to the discrete additive group of integers.
