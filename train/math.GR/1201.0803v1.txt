If G is a group of permutations of a set \Omega and \alpha \in \Omega, then the {\em \alpha-suborbits} of G are the orbits of the stabilizer G_\alpha on \Omega. The cardinality of an \alpha-suborbit is called a {\em subdegree} of G. If the only G-invariant equivalence classes on \Omega are the trivial and universal relations, then G is said to be a {\em primitive} group of permutations of \Omega.   In this paper we determine the structure of all primitive permutation groups whose subdegrees are bounded above by a finite cardinal number.
