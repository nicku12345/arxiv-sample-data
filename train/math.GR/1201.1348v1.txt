If G is a finite primitive complex reflection group, all reflection subgroups of G and their inclusions are determined up to conjugacy. As a consequence, it is shown that if the rank of G is n and if G can be generated by n reflections, then for every set R of n reflections which generate G, every subset of R generates a parabolic subgroup of G.
