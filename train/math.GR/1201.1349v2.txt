We prove that every non-elementary hyperbolic group G acts with maximal growth on some set X such that every orbit of any element g \in G is finite. As a side-product of our approach we prove that if G is non-elementary hyperbolic, \HH \leq G is quasiconvex of infinite index then there exists g \in G such that <\HH,g> is quasiconvex of infinite index and is isomorphic to \HH*<g > if and only if \HH \cap E(G)= \{e\} , where E(G) is the maximal finite normal subgroup of G.
