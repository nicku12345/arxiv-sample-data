Let U = \mathbf U(q) be a Sylow p-subgroup of a finite Chevalley group G = \mathbf G(q). In [GR}] R\"ohrle and the second author determined a parameterization of the conjugacy classes of U, for \mathbf G of small rank when q is a power of a good prime for \mathbf G. As a consequence they verified that the number k(U) of conjugacy classes of U is given by a polynomial in q with integer coefficients. In the present paper, we consider the case when p is a bad prime for \mathbf G. We obtain a parameterization of the conjugacy classes of U, when \mathbf G has rank less than or equal to 4, and \mathbf G is not of type F_4. In these cases we deduce that k(U) is given by a polynomial in q with integer coefficients; this polynomial is different from the polynomial for good primes.
