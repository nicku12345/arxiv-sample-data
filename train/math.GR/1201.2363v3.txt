Counting homomorphisms between cyclic groups is a common exercise in a first course in abstract algebra. A similar problem, accessible at the same level, is to count the number of group homomorphisms from a dihedral group of order 2m into a dihedral group of order 2n. While the solution requires only elementary group theory, the result does not appear in the literature or in the usual texts. As the solution may be of interest, particularly to those teaching undergraduate abstract algebra, it is provided in this note.
