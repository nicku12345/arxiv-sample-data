We show that there is an order-preserving embedding of the additive group of rational numbers \mathbb{Q} into a 2-generator group G. The group G can be chosen to be a solvable group G of length 3, which is a minimal result in the sense that it cannot be chosen to be neither solvable of length 2, nor a nilpotent group. For any non-trivial word set V \subseteq F_\infty there is an order-preserving verbal embedding of \mathbb{Q} into a 2-generator group G. The embeddings constructed are subnormal.
