The width \wid(G,W) of the verbal subgroup v(G,W) of a group G defined by a collection of group words W is the smallest number m in \mathbb N \cup {+\infty} such that every element of v(G,W) is can be represented as the product of at most m words in W evaluated on the group G and their inverses. Recall that every verbal subgroup of the group T_{n} (K) of triangular matrices over an arbitrary field K can be defined by just one word: an outer commutator word or a power word. We prove that for every outer commutator word w the equality \wid(T_{n} (K),w)=1 holds on the group T_{n} (K) and that if w=x^{s} then \wid(T_{n}(K),w)=1 except in two cases:   (1) the field K is finite and s is divisible by the characteristic p of K but not by |K|-1;   (2) the field K is finite and s=p^{t} (|K|-1)^{u} r for r,t,u\in \mathbb N with n\ge p^{t} +3, while r not divisible by p.   In these cases the width equals 2. For finitary triangular groups the situation is similar, but in the second case the restriction n\ge p^{t} +3 is superfluous.
