In this paper we study twisted conjugacy classes and the R_{\infty}-property for classical linear groups. In particular, we prove that the general linear group {\rm GL}_n(K) and the special linear group {\rm SL}_n(K) possess R_{\infty}-property, if n\geq3 and K is an infinite integral domain with trivial group of automorphisms (Theorem 1), or K is an integral domain, which has a zero characteristic and for which {\rm Aut}(K) is torsion (Theorem 2).
