The paper studies lower bounds for the dimensions of projective indecomposable modules for Chevalley groups G in defining characteristic p. The main result extending earlier one by Malle and Weigel (2008) determines the modules in question of dimension equal to the order of a Sylow p-subgroup of G. We also substantially generalize a result by Ballard (1978) on lower bounds for the dimensions of projective indecomposable modules and find lower bounds in some cases where Ballard's bounds are vacuous.
