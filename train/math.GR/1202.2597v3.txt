We show that every non-elementary hyperbolic group \G admits a proper affine isometric action on L^p(\bd\G\times \bd\G), where \bd\G denotes the boundary of \G and p is large enough. Our construction involves a \G-invariant measure on \bd\G\times \bd\G analogous to the Bowen - Margulis measure from the CAT(-1) setting, as well as a geometric cocycle \`a la Busemann. We also deduce that \G admits a proper affine isometric action on the first \ell^p-cohomology group H^1_{(p)}(\G) for large enough p.
