In this paper we investigate metric properties of the groups \Gamma_d(q) whose Cayley graphs are the Diestel-Leader graphs DL_d(q) with respect to a given generating set S_{d,q}. These groups provide a geometric generalization of the family of lamplighter groups, whose Cayley graphs with respect to a certain generating set are the Diestel-Leader graphs DL_2(q). Bartholdi, Neuhauser and Woess in \cite{BNW} show that for d \geq 3, \Gamma_d(q) is of type F_{d-1} but not F_d. We show below that these groups have dead end elements of arbitrary depth with respect to the generating set S_{d,q}, as well as infinitely many cone types and hence no regular language of geodesics. These results are proven using a combinatorial formula to compute the word length of group elements with respect to S_{d,q} which is also proven in the paper and relies on the geometry of the Diestel-Leader graphs.
