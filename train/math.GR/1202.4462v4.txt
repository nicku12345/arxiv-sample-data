We prove that the simplicial boundary of a CAT(0) cube complex admitting a proper, cocompact action by a virtually \integers^n group is isomorphic to the hyperoctahedral triangulation of S^{n-1}, providing a class of groups G for which the simplicial boundary of a G-cocompact cube complex depends only on G. We also use this result to show that the cocompactly cubulated crystallographic groups in dimension n are precisely those that are \emph{hyperoctahedral}. We apply this result to answer a question of Wise on cocompactly cubulating virtually free abelian groups.
