A locally compact group G is said to be \ast-regular if the natural map \Psi:\Prim C^\ast(G)\to\Prim_{\ast} L^1(G) is a homeomorphism with respect to the Jacobson topologies on the primitive ideal spaces \Prim C^\ast(G) and \Prim_{\ast} L^1(G). In 1980 J. Boidol characterized the \ast-regular ones among all exponential Lie groups by a purely algebraic condition. In this article we introduce the notion of L^1-determined ideals in order to discuss the weaker property of primitive \ast-regularity. We give two sufficient criteria for closed ideals I of C^\ast(G) to be L^1-determined. Herefrom we deduce a strategy to prove that a given exponential Lie group is primitive \ast-regular. The author proved in his thesis that all exponential Lie groups of dimension \le 7 have this property. So far no counter-example is known. Here we discuss the example G=B_5, the only critical one in dimension \le 5.
