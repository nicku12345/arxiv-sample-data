The classic Magnus embedding is a very effective tool in the study of abelian extensions of a finitely generated group G, allowing us to see the extension as a subgroup of a wreath product of a free abelian group with G. In particular, the embedding has proved to be useful when studying free solvable groups. An equivalent geometric definition of the Magnus embedding is constructed and it is used to show that it is 2-bi-Lipschitz, with respect to an obvious choice of generating sets. This is then applied to obtain a non-zero lower bound on L_p compression exponents in free solvable groups.
