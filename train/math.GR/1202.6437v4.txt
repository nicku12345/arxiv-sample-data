We show that every group H of at most exponential growth with respect to some left invariant metric admits a bi-Lipschitz embedding into a finitely generated group G such that G is amenable (respectively, solvable, satisfies a non-trivial identity, elementary amenable, of finite decomposition complexity, etc.) whenever H is. We also discuss some applications to compression functions of Lipschitz embeddings into uniformly convex Banach spaces, F{\o}lner functions, and elementary classes of amenable groups.
