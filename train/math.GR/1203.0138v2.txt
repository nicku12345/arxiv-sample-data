Let G be a (2,m,n)-group and let x be the number of distinct primes dividing \chi, the Euler characteristic of G. We prove, first, that, apart from a finite number of known exceptions, a non-abelian simple composition factor T of G is a finite group of Lie type with rank n\leq x. This result is proved using new results connecting the prime graph of T to the integer x.   We then study the particular cases x=1 and x=2. We give a general structure statement for (2,m,n)-groups which have Euler characteristic a prime power, and we construct an infinite family of these objects. We also give a complete classification of those (2,m,n)-groups which are almost simple and for which the Euler characteristic is a prime power (there are four such).   Finally we study those (2,m,n)-groups which are almost simple and for which the Euler characteristic is a product of two prime powers. All such groups which are not isomorphic to PSL_2(q) or PGL_2(q) are completely classified.
