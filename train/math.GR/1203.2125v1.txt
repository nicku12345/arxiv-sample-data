The main aim of this article is to establish a classification of simple polyadic groups in terms of ordinary groups and their automorphisms. We give two different definitions of simpleness for polyadic groups, from the point of views of universal algebra, UAS (universal algebraically simpleness), and group theory, GTS (group theoretically simpleness). We obtain the necessary and sufficient conditions for a polyadic group to be UAS or GTS.
