In this paper we continue the investigations on the algebraic structure of a finite semigroup S that is determined by its associated upper non-nilpotent graph \mathcal{N}_{S}. The vertices of this graph are the elements of S and two vertices are adjacent if they generate a semigroup that is not nilpotent (in the sense of Malcev). We introduce a class of semigroups in which the Mal'cev nilpotent property lifts through ideal chains. We call this the class of \B\ semigroups. The definition is such that the global information that a semigroup is not nilpotent induces local information, i.e. some two-generated subsemigroups are not nilpotent. It turns out that a finite monoid (in particular, a finite group) is \B\ if and only if it is nilpotent. Our main result is a description of \B\ finite semigroups S in terms of their associated graph {\mathcal N}_{S}. In particular, S has a largest nilpotent ideal, say K, and S/K is a 0-disjoint union of its connected components (adjoined with a zero) with at least two elements.
