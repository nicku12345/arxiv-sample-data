In this paper, rough approximations of Cayley graphs are studied and rough edge Cayley graphs are introduced. Furthermore, a new algebraic definition called pseudo-Cayley graphs containing Cayley graphs is proposed. Rough approximation is expanded to pseudo-Cayley graphs. Also, rough vertex pseudo-Cayley graphs and rough pseudo-Cayley graphs are introduced. Some theorems are provided, form which some properties such as connectivity and optimal connectivity are derived. This approach opens a new research field in sciences such as data networks.
