Let p be a prime and G a subgroup of GL_d(p). We define G to be p-exceptional if it has order divisible by p, but all its orbits on vectors have size coprime to p. We obtain a classification of p-exceptional linear groups. This has consequences for a well known conjecture in representation theory, and also for a longstanding question concerning 1/2-transitive linear groups (i.e. those having all orbits on nonzero vectors of equal length), classifying those of order divisible by p.
