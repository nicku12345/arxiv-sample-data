We extend the construction of multiplicative representations for a free group G introduced by Kuhn and Steger (Isr. J., (144) 2004) in such a way that the new class Mult(G) so defined is stable under taking the finite direct sum, under changes of generators (and hence is Aut(G)-invariant), under restriction to and induction from a subgroup of finite index.   The main tool is the detailed study of the properties of the action of a free group on its Cayley graph with respect to a change of generators, as well as the relative properties of the action of a subgroup of finite index after the choice of a "nice" fundamental domain.   These stability properties of Mult(G) are essential in the construction of a new class of representations for a virtually free group (Iozzi-Kuhn-Steger, arXiv:1112.4709v1)
