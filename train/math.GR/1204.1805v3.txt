Let A \leq G be a subgroup of a group G. An A-complement of G is a subgroup H of G such that G = A H and A \cap H = \{1\}. The \emph{classifying complements problem} asks for the description and classification of all A-complements of G. We shall give the answer to this problem in three steps. Let H be a given A-complement of G and (\triangleright, \triangleleft) the canonical left/right actions associated to the factorization G = A H. To start with, H is deformed to a new A-complement of G, denoted by H_r, using a certain map r: H \to A called a deformation map of the matched pair (A, H, \triangleright, \triangleleft). Then the description of all complements is given: {\mathbb H} is an A-complement of G if and only if {\mathbb H} is isomorphic to H_{r}, for some deformation map r: H \to A. Finally, the classification of complements proves that there exists a bijection between the isomorphism classes of all A-complements of G and a cohomological object {\mathcal D} \, (H, A \, | \,(\triangleright, \triangleleft)). As an application we show that the theoretical formula for computing the number of isomorphism types of all groups of order n arises only from the factorization S_n = S_{n-1} C_n.
