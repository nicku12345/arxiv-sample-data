Let X be a finite set such that |X|=n and let i\leq j \leq n. A group G\leq \sym is said to be (i,j)-homogeneous if for every I,J\subseteq X, such that |I|=i and |J|=j, there exists g\in G such that Ig\subseteq J. (Clearly (i,i)-homogeneity is i-homogeneity in the usual sense.)   A group G\leq \sym is said to have the k-universal transversal property if given any set I\subseteq X (with |I|=k) and any partition P of X into k blocks, there exists g\in G such that Ig is a section for P. (That is, the orbit of each k-subset of X contains a section for each k-partition of X.)   In this paper we classify the groups with the k-universal transversal property (with the exception of two classes of 2-homogeneous groups) and the (k-1,k)-homogeneous groups (for 2<k\leq \lfloor \frac{n+1}{2}\rfloor). As a corollary of the classification we prove that a (k-1,k)-homogeneous group is also (k-2,k-1)-homogeneous, with two exceptions; and similarly, but with no exceptions, groups having the k-universal transversal property have the (k-1)-universal transversal property.   A corollary of all the previous results is a classification of the groups that together with any rank k transformation on X generate a regular semigroup (for 1\leq k\leq \lfloor \frac{n+1}{2}\rfloor).   The paper ends with a number of challenges for experts in number theory, group and/or semigroup theory, linear algebra and matrix theory.
