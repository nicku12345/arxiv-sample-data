We explore some of the special features with respect to Bredon cohomology of groups having all its finite subgroups either nilpotent or p-groups or cyclic p-groups. We get some results on dimensions and also a formula for the equivariant Euler class for certain groups. We consider the generalization for Bredon cohomology of the properties of being duality or Poincar\'e duality and study their behavior under p-power index extensions with coefficients in a field of characteristic p.
