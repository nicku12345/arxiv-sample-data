Finite groups G such that G/Z(G) \simeq C_2 \times C_2 where C_2 denotes a cyclic group of order 2 and Z(G) is the center of G were studied in \cite{casofinito} and were used to classify finite loops with alternative loop algebras. In this paper we extend this result to finitely generated groups such that G/Z(G) \simeq C_p \times C_p where C_p denotes a cyclic group of prime order p and provide an explicit description of all such groups.
