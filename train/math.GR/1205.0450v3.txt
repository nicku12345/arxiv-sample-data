Let X be a finite set such that |X|=n. Let \trans and \sym denote respectively the transformation monoid and the symmetric group on n points. Given a\in \trans\setminus \sym, we say that a group G\leq \sym is a-normalizing if <a,G> \setminus G=<g^{{-1}}ag\mid g\in G>. If G is a-normalizing for all a\in \trans\setminus \sym, then we say that G is normalizing. The goal of this paper is to classify normalizing groups and hence answer a question posed elsewhere. The paper ends with a number of problems for experts in groups, semigroups and matrix theory.
