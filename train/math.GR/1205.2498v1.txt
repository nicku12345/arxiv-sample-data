Let \cal F be a class of groups. A chief factor H/K of a group G is called \emph{{\cal F}-central in G} provided (H/K)\rtimes (G/C_{G}(H/K)) \in {\cal F}. We write Z_{\pi{\cal F}}(G) to denote the product of all normal subgroups of G whose G-chief factors of order divisible by at least one prime in \pi are \cal F-central. We call Z_{\pi{\cal F}}(G) the \pi{\cal F}-hypercentre of G. A subgroup U of a group G is called \emph{\cal F-maximal} in G provided that (a) U\in {\cal F}, and (b) if U\leq V\leq G and V\in {\cal F}, then U=V.   In this paper we study the properties of the intersection of all \cal F-maximal subgroups of a finite group. In particular, we analyze the condition under which Z_{\pi{\cal F}}(G) coincides with the intersection of all \cal F-maximal subgroups of G.
