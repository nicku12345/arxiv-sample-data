This paper introduces the notion of orbit coherence in a permutation group. Let G be a group of permutations of a set \Omega. Let \pi(G) be the set of partitions of \Omega which arise as the orbit partition of an element of G. The set of partitions of \Omega is naturally ordered by refinement, and admits join and meet operations. We say that G is join-coherent if \pi(G) is join-closed, and meet-coherent if \pi(G) is meet-closed.   Our central theorem states that the centralizer in \Sym(\Omega) of any permutation g is meet-coherent, and subject to a certain finiteness condition on the orbits of g, also join-coherent. In particular, if \Omega is a finite set then the orbit partitions of elements of the centralizer in \Sym(\Omega) of g form a lattice.   A related result states that the intransitive direct product and the imprimitive wreath product of two finite permutation groups are join-coherent if and only if each of the groups is join-coherent. We also classify the groups G such that \pi(G) is a chain and prove two further theorems classifying the primitive join-coherent groups of finite degree, and the join-coherent groups of degree n normalizing a subgroup generated by an n-cycle.
