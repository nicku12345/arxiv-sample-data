Let R be a subset of a group G. We call a subgroup H of G the R-conjugate-permutable subgroup of G, if HH^{x}=H^{x}H for all x\in R. This concept is a generalization of conjugate-permutable subgroups introduced by T. Foguel. Our work focuses on the influence of R-conjugate-permutable subgroups on the structure of finite groups in case when R is the Fitting subgroup or its generalizations F^{*}(G) (introduced by H. Bender in 1970) and \tilde{F}(G) (introduced by P. Shmid 1972). We obtain a new criteria for nilpotency and supersolubility of finite groups which generalize some well known results.
