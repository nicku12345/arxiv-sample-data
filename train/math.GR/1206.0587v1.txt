A precompact group topology \tau on an abelian group G is called {\em single sequence characterized} (for short, {\em ss-characterized}) if there is a sequence \mathbf{u}= (u_n) in G such that \tau is the finest precompact group topology on G making \mathbf{u}=(u_n) converge to zero. It is proved that a metrizable precompact abelian group (G,\tau) is ss-characterized iff it is countable. For every metrizable precompact group topology \tau on a countably infinite abelian group G there exists a group topology \eta such that \eta is strictly finer than \tau and the groups (G,\tau) and (G,\eta) have the equal Pontryagin dual groups. We give a complete description of all ss-characterized precompact abelian groups modulo countable ss-characterized groups from which we derive:   (1) No infinite pseudocompact abelian group is ss-characterized.   (2) An ss-characterized precompact abelian group is hereditarily disconnected.
