In this paper, we compute the {\Sigma}^n(G) and {\Omega}^n(G) invariants when 1 \rightarrow H \rightarrow G \rightarrow K \rightarrow 1 is a short exact sequence of finitely generated groups with K finite. We also give sufficient conditions for G to have the R_{\infty} property in terms of {\Omega}^n(H) and {\Omega}^n(K) when either K is finite or the sequence splits. As an application, we construct a group F \rtimes? Z_2 where F is the R. Thompson's group F and show that F \rtimes Z_2 has the R_{\infty} property while F is not characteristic.
