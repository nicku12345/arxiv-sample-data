Motivated by the Benjamini-Schramm non-unicity of percolation conjecture we study the following question. For a given finitely generated non-amenable group \Gamma, does there exist a generating set S such that the Cayley graph (\Gamma,S), without loops and multiple edges, has non-unique percolation, i.e., p_c(\Gamma,S)<p_u(\Gamma,S)? We show that this is true if \Gamma contains an infinite normal subgroup N such that \Gamma/ N is non-amenable. Moreover for any finitely generated group G containing \Gamma there exists a generating set S' of G such that p_c(G,S')<p_u(G,S'). In particular this applies to free Burnside groups B(n,p) with n \geq 2, p \geq 665. We also explore how various non-amenability numerics, such as the isoperimetric constant and the spectral radius, behave on various growing generating sets in the group.
