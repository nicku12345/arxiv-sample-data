We give an interpretation of the construction of torsors from preceding work (Bertram, Kinyon: Associative Geometries. I, J. Lie Theory 20) in terms of classical projective geometry. For the Desarguesian case, this leads to a reformulation of certain results from lot.cit., whereas for the Moufang case the result is new. But even in the Desarguesian case it sheds new light on the relation between the lattice structure and the algebraic structures of a projective space.
