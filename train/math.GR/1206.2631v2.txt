Kropholler and Mislin conjectured that groups acting admissibly on a finite-dimensional G-CW-complex with finite stabilisers admit a finite-dimensional model for E_FG, the classifying space for proper actions. This conjecture is known to hold for groups with bounded torsion. In this note we consider a large class of groups U containing the above and many known examples with unbounded torsion. We show that the conjecture holds for a large subclass of U.
