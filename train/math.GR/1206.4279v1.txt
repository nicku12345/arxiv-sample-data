For a non-cyclic finite group G, let \gamma(G) denote the smallest number of conjugacy classes of proper subgroups of G needed to cover G. Bubboloni, Praeger and Spiga, motivated by questions in number theory, have recently established that \gamma(S_n) and \gamma(A_{n}) are bounded above and below by linear functions of n. In this paper we show that if G is in the range \SL_{n}(q)\le G\le \GL_{n}(q) for n>2, then n/\pi^2 < \gamma(G) \le (n+1)/2. We give various alternative bounds, and derive explicit formulas for \gamma(G) in some cases.
