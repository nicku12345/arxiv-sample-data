Let G be a nonabelian finite group and let d be an irreducible character degree of G. Then there is a positive integer e so that |G| = d(d+e). Snyder has shown that if e > 1, then |G| is bounded by a function of e. This bound has been improved by Isaacs and by Durfee and Jensen. In this paper, we will show for groups that have a nontrivial, abelian normal subgroup that |G| \le e^4 - e^3. We use this to prove that |G| < e^4 + e^3 for all groups. Given that there are a number of solvable groups that meet the first bound, it is best possible. Our work makes use of results regarding Camina pairs, Gagola characters, and Suzuki 2-groups.
