For the semi simple and deployed Lie algebra \mathfrak g=\mathfrak{sl}(n, \R), we give an explicit construction of an overalgebra \mathfrak g^+=\mathfrak g\rtimes V of \mathfrak g, where V is a finite dimensional vector space. In such a setup, we prove the existence of a map \Phi from the dual \mathfrak g^\star of \mathfrak g into the dual (\mathfrak g^+)^\star of \mathfrak g^+ such that the coadjoint orbits of \Phi(\xi), for generic \xi in \mathfrak g^\star, have a distinct closed convex hulls. Therefore, these closed convex hulls separate 'almost' the generic coadjoint orbits of G.
