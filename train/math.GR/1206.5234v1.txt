If (W,S) is a right-angled Coxeter system and W has no \mathbb Z^3 subgroups, then it is shown that the absence of an elementary separation property in the presentation diagram for (W,S) implies all CAT(0) spaces acted on geometrically by W have locally connected CAT(0) boundary. It was previously known that if the presentation diagram of a general right-angled Coxeter system satisfied the separation property then all CAT(0) spaces acted on geometrically by W have non-locally connected boundary. In particular, this gives a complete classification of the right-angled Coxeter groups with no 3-flats and with locally connected boundary.
