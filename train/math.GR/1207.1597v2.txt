We study the centralisers of elements, finite subgroups and virtually cyclic subgroups of Houghton's group Hn. We discuss various Bredon (co-)homological finiteness conditions satisfied by Hn including the Bredon (co-)homological dimension and Bredon-FPn conditions, which are analogs of the ordinary co-homological dimension and FPn conditions respectively.
