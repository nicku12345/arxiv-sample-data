It was proved by Sela and by the authors that every formula in the theory of a free group F is equivalent to a boolean combination of \exists\forall-formulas. We also proved that the elementary theory of a free group is decidable (there is an algorithm given a sentence to decide whether this sentence belongs to Th(F)). In this paper we give an algorithm for reduction of a first order formula over a free group to an equivalent boolean combination of \exists\forall-formulas.
