We present the classification of reflective quadratic forms -px_0^2+x_1^2+\ldots+x_n^2 for p prime. We show that for p = 5, it is reflective for 2\leq n\leq 8, for p = 7\text{ and }17 it is reflective for n = 2\text{ and }3, for p=11 it is reflective for p=2,3,\text{ and } 4, and it is not reflective for higher values of n. We also show that it is non-reflective for n > 2 when p = 13,19,\text{and }23. This completes the classification of these forms with p prime.
