We will give an example of a branch group G that has exponential growth but does not contain any non-abelian free subgroups. This answers question 16 from \cite{Bartholdi} positively. The proof demonstrates how to construct a non-trivial word w_{a,b}(x,y) for any a,b \in G such that w_{a,b}(a,b) = 1. The group G is not just-infinite. We prove that every normal subgroup of G is finitely generated as an abstract group and every proper quotient soluble. Further, G has infinite virtual first Betti number but is not large.
