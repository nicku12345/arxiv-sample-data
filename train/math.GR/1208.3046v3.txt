We obtain certain results on a finite p-group whose central automorphisms are all class preserving. In particular, we prove that if G is a finite p-group whose central automorphisms are all class preserving, then d(G) is even, where d(G) denotes the number of elements in any minimal generating set for G. As an application of these results, we obtain some results regarding finite p-groups whose automorphisms are all class preserving. In particular, we prove that if G is a finite p-groups whose automorphisms are all class preserving, then order of G is at least p^8 and the order of the automorphism group of G is at least p^12.
