In the present paper we continue studying regular free group actions on Z^n-trees. We show that every finitely generated Z^n-free group G can be embedded into a finitely generated Z^n-free group H acting regularly on the underlying Z^n-tree (we call H a regular Z^n-completion of G) so that the action of G is preserved. Moreover, if G is effectively represented as a group of Z^n-words then the construction of H is effective and H is effectively represented as a group of Z^n-words.
