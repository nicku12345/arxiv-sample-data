In this paper, we deal with locally graded groups whose subgroups are either subnormal or soluble of bounded derived length, say d. In particular, we prove that every locally (soluble-by-finite) group with this property is either soluble or an extension of a soluble group of derived length at most d by a finite group, which fits between a minimal simple group and its automorphism group. We also classify all the finite non-abelian simple groups whose proper subgroups are metabelian.
