Mitsch's natural partial order on the semigroup of binary relations is here characterised by equations in the theory of relation algebras. The natural partial order has a complex relationship with the compatible partial order of inclusion, which is explored by means of a sublattice of the lattice of preorders on the semigroup. The corresponding sublattice for the partition monoid is also described.
