We generalize Lewis's result about a central series associated with the vanishing off subgroup. We write V_{1}=V(G) for the vanishing off subgroup of G, and V_{i}=[V_{i-1},G] for the terms in this central series. Lewis proved that there exists a positive integer n such that if V_{3} < G_{3}, then |G:V_{1}|=|G':V_{2}|^{2}=p^{2n}. Let D_{3}/V_{3} = C_{G/V_{3}}(G'/V_{3}). He also showed that if V_{3} < G_{3}, then either |G:D_{3}|=p^{n} or D_{3}=V_{1}. We show that if V_{i} <G_{i} for i\ge 4, where G_{i} is the i-th term in the lower central series of G, then |G_{i-1}:V_{i-1}|=|G:D_{3}|.
