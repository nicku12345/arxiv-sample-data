We prove that there is a gap between \sqrt{2} and (1+\sqrt{5})/2 for the exponential growth rate of free products G=A*B not isomorphic to the infinite dihedral group. For amalgamated products G=A*_C B with ([A:C]-1)([B:C]-1)\geq2, we show that lower exponential growth rate than \sqrt{2} can be achieved by proving that the exponential growth rate of the amalgamated product \mathrm{PGL}(2,\mathbb{Z})\cong (C_2\times C_2) *_{C_2} D_6 is equal to the unique positive root of the polynomial z^3-z-1. This answers two questions by Avinoam Mann [The growth of free products, Journal of Algebra 326, no. 1 (2011) 208--217].
