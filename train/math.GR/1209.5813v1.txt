Let G be a reductive algebraic group over an algebraically closed field k of characteristic p>0, and assume p is good for G. Let P be a parabolic subgroup with unipotent radical U. For r \ge 1, denote by \mathbb{G}_{a(r)} the r-th Frobenius kernel of \mathbb{G}_a. We prove that if the nilpotence class of U is less than p, then any embedding of \mathbb{G}_{a(r)} in U lies inside a one-parameter subgroup of U, and there is a canonical way in which to choose such a subgroup. Applying this result, we prove that if p is at least as big as the Coxeter number of G, then the cohomological variety of G_{(r)} is homeomorphic to the variety of r-tuples of commuting elements in \mathcal{N}_1(\mathfrak{g}), the [p]-nilpotent cone of Lie(G).
