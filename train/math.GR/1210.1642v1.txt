Automorphic loops are loops in which all inner mappings are automorphisms. This variety of loops includes, for instance, groups and commutative Moufang loops.   We study uniquely 2-divisible automorphic loops, particularly automorphic loops of odd order, from the point of view of the associated Bruck loops (motivated by Glauberman's work on uniquely 2-divisible Moufang loops) and the associated Lie rings (motivated by a construction of Wright). We prove that every automorphic loop Q of odd order is solvable, contains an element of order p for every prime p dividing |Q|, and |S| divides |Q| for every subloop S of Q.   There are no finite simple nonassociative commutative automorphic loops, and there are no finite simple nonassociative automorphic loops of order less than 2500. We show that if Q is a finite simple nonassociative automorphic loop then the socle of the multiplication group of Q is not regular. The existence of a finite simple nonassociative automorphic loop remains open.   Let p be an odd prime. Automorphic loops of order p or p^2 are groups, but there exist nonassociative automorphic loops of order p^3, some with trivial nucleus (center) and of exponent p. We construct nonassociative "dihedral" automorphic loops of order 2n for every n>2, and show that there are precisely p-2 nonassociative automorphic loops of order 2p, all of them dihedral.
