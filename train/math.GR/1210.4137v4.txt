Linear and projective boundaries of Cayley graphs were introduced in~\cite{kst} as quasi-isometry invariant boundaries of finitely generated groups. They consist of forward orbits g^\infty=\{g^i: i\in \mathbb N\}, or orbits g^{\pm\infty}=\{g^i:i\in\mathbb Z\}, respectively, of non-torsion elements~g of the group G, where `sufficiently close' (forward) orbits become identified, together with a metric bounded by 1.   We show that for all finitely generated groups, the distance between the antipodal points g^\infty and g^{-\infty} in the linear boundary is bounded from below by \sqrt{1/2}, and we give an example of a group which has two antipodal elements of distance at most \sqrt{12/17}<1. Our example is a derivation of the Baumslag-Gersten group. \newline We also exhibit a group with elements g and h such that g^\infty = h^\infty, but g^{-\infty}\neq h^{-\infty}. Furthermore, we introduce a notion of average-case-distortion---called growth---and compute explicit positive lower bounds for distances between points g^\infty and h^\infty which are limits of group elements g and h with different growth.
