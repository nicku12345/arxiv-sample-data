We classify abelian subgroups of the automorphism group of any compact simple Lie algebra whose centralizer has the same dimension as the dimension of the subgroup. This leads to a classification of the maximal abelian subgroups of compact simple groups of adjoint type and a classification of the fine group gradings of complex simple Lie algebras.
