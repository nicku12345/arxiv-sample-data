Isomorphy classes of k-involutions have been studied for their correspondence with generalized symmetric spaces of algebraic groups. This is a continuation of papers written by A.G. Helminck and collaborators that are regarding algebraic groups of classical type. Here we begin doing the same for algebraic groups of exceptional type.
