A cylinder C^1_u is the set of infinite words with fixed prefix u. A double-cylinder C^2_{[1,u]} is "the same" for bi-infinite words. We show that for every word u and any automorphism \varphi of the free group F the image \varphi(C^1_u) is a finite union of cylinders. The analogous statement is true for double cylinders. We give (a) an algorithm, and (b) a precise formula which allows one to determine this finite union of cylinders.
