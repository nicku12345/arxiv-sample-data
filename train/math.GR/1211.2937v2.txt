We know that \mathbb{Z}_n is a finite field for a prime number n. Let m,n be arbitrary natural numbers and let \mathbb{Z}^m_n= \mathbb{Z}_n \times\mathbb{Z}_n\times...\times\mathbb{Z}_n be the Cartesian product of m rings \mathbb{Z}_n. In this note, we present the action of SL(m, \mathbb{Z}_n)=\{A \in \mathbb{Z}^{m,m}_{n} : det A \equiv 1 (mod\simn)\}, where SL(m, \mathbb{Z}_n) for n\geq 2 is a group under matrix multiplication modulo n, on the ring \mathbb{Z}^m_n as a right multiplication of a row vector of \mathbb{Z}^m_n by a matrix of SL(m, \mathbb{Z}_n) to determine the orbits of the ring \mathbb{Z}^m_n.
