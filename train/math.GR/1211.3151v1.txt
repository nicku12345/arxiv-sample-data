Let G be a real semisimple Lie group with trivial centre and no compact factors. Given a conjugate pair of either real hyperbolic elements or unipotent elements a and b in G we find a conjugating element g \in G such that d_G(1,g) \leq L(d_G(1,u)+d_G(1,v)), where L is a positive constant which will depend on some property of a and b. For the vast majority of such elements however, L can be assumed to be a uniform constant.
