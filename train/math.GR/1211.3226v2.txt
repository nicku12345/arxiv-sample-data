In this paper we study random walks on a finitely generated group G which has a free action on a \mathbb{Z}^n-tree. We show that if G is non-abelian and acts minimally, freely and without inversions on a locally finite \mathbb{Z}^n-tree \Gamma with the set of open ends {\rm Ends}(\Gamma), then for every non-degenerate probability measure \mu on G there exists a unique \mu-stationary probability measure \nu_\mu on {\rm Ends}(\Gamma), and the space ({\rm Ends}(\Gamma), \nu_\mu) is a \mu-boundary. Moreover, if \mu has finite first moment with respect to the word metric on G (induced by a finite generating set), then the measure space ({\rm Ends}(\Gamma), \nu_\mu) is isomorphic to the Poisson--Furstenberg boundary of (G, \mu).
