Let \rG be a reductive group over a commutative ring k. In this article, we prove that the adjoint quotient \adqG is stable under base change. Moreover, if \rG has a maximal torus \rT, then the adjoint quotient of the torus \rT by its Weyl group will be isomorphic to \adqG. Then we focus on the semisimple simply connected group \rG of the constant type. In this case, \adqG is isomorphic to the Weil restriction \underset{\rD/\spec k}{\prod}\aff^{1}_\rD, where \rD is the Dynkin scheme of \rG. Then we prove that for such \rG, the Steinberg's cross-section can be defined over k if \rG is quasi-split and without \rA_{2m}-type components
