Let G be a finite group and H be a subgroup of G. In this paper, we prove that if G is a finite nilpotent group and H a subgroup of G, then H is normal in G if and only if all normalized right transversals of H in G are isotopic, where the isotopism classes are formed with respect to induced right loop structures. We have also determined the number isotopy classes of transversals of a subgroup of order 2 in D_{2p}, the dihedral group of order 2p, where p is an odd prime.
