In this short article, we study the extremal behavior F_\Gamma(n) of divisibility functions D_\Gamma introduced by the first author for finitely generated groups \Gamma. We show finitely generated subgroups of \GL(m,K) for an infinite field K have at most polynomial growth for the function F_\Gamma(n). Consequently, we obtain a dichotomy for the growth rate of \log F_\Gamma(n) for finitely generated subgroups of \GL(n,\C). We also show that if F_\Gamma(n) \preceq \log \log n, then \Gamma is finite. In contrast, when \Gamma contains an element of infinite order, \log n \preceq F_\Gamma(n). We end with a brief discussion of some geometric motivation for this work.
