A B-group is a group such that all its minimal generating sets (with respect to inclusion) have the same size. We prove that the class of finite B-groups is closed under taking quotients and that every finite B-group is solvable. Via a complete classification of Frattini-free finite B-groups we obtain a general structure theorem for finite B-groups. Applications include new proofs for the characterization of finite matroid groups and the classification of finite groups with the basis property.
