Let G be an arbitrary group such that G/\Z(G) is finite, where \Z(G) denotes the center of the group G. Then \gamma_2(G), the commutator subgroup of G, is finite. This result is known as Shur's theorem (the Schur's theorem). In this short note we provide a quick survey on the converse of Schur's theorem, generalize known results in this direction and prove the following result (which is perhaps the most suitable statement for converse of the Schur's theorem): If G is an arbitrary group with finite \gamma_2(G), then G/\Z(G) is finite if \Z_2(G)/\Z(\Z_2(G)) is finitely generated, where \Z_2(G) denotes the second center of a group G. If G/\Z(G) is finite, then \gamma_2(G) is also finite and |G/\Z(G)| \le |\gamma_2(G)|^d, where d denotes the number of elements in any minimal generating ser for G/\Z(G). We classify all nilpotent groups G of class 2 upto isoclinism (in the sense of P. Hall) such that |G/\Z(G)| = |\gamma_2(G)|^d, and ask some questions in the sequel.
