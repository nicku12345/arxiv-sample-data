We study the probability of a given element, in the commutator subgroup of a group, to be equal to a commutator of two randomly chosen group elements, and compute explicit formulas for calculating this probability for some interesting classes of groups having only two different conjugacy class sizes. We re-prove the fact that if G is a finite group such that the set of its conjugacy class sizes is \{1, p\}, where p is a prime integer, then G is isoclinic (in the sense of P. Hall) to an extraspecial p-group.
