Let G be a group. The central automorphism group Aut_c(G) of G is the centralizer of Inn(G) the subgroup of Aut(G) of inner automorphisms. There is a one to one map  \sigma \mapsto h_\sigma from the set Aut_c(G) onto the set Hom(G,Z(G)) of homomorphisms from G onto its center, with  h_\sigma(x)=x^{-1} \sigma(x). This map can be used to obtain informations about the size of Aut_c(G), and also about its structure in some special cases. In this paper we see how to use it to obtain informations about the structure of Aut_c(G) in the general case. The notion of the adjoint group of a ring is the main tool in our approach.
