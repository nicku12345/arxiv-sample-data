For any finitely generated group G, two complexity functions \alpha_G and \beta_G are defined to measure the maximal possible gap between the norm of an automorphism (respectively outer automorphism) of G and the norm of its inverse. Restricting attention to free groups F_r, the exact asymptotic behaviour of \alpha_2 and \beta_2 is computed. For rank r\geqslant 3, polynomial lower bounds are provided for \alpha_r and \beta_r, and the existence of a polynomial upper bound is proved for \beta_r.
