We classify quadratic SL(2,K)- and sl(2,K)-modules by crude computation, generalizing in the first case a Theorem proved independently by F.-G. Timmesfeld and S. Smith. The paper is the first of a series dealing with linearization results for abstract modules of algebraic groups and associated Lie rings.
