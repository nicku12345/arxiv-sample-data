A biextraspecial group of rank m is an extension of a special 2-group Q of the form 2^{2 + 2m} by L\cong L_2(2), such that the 3-element from L acts on Q fixed-point-freely. Subgroups of this type appear in at least the sporadic groups J_2, J_3, McL, Suz, and Co_1. In this paper we completely classify biextraspecial groups, namely, we show that the rank m must be even and for each such m there exist exactly two biextraspecial groups B^\varepsilon(m) up to isomorphism where \varepsilon\in{+,-}. We also prove that \Out(B^\varepsilon(m)) is an extension of the m-dimensional orthogonal GF(2)-space of type \varepsilon by the corresponding orthogonal group. The extension is non-split except in a few small cases.
