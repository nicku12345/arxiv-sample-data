In the paper we introduce topological \mathbb{Z}-Bruck-Reilly and topological \mathbb{Z}-Bruck extensions of (semi)topological monoids which are generalizations of topological Bruck-Reilly and topological Bruck extensions of (semi)topological monoids and study their topologizations. The sufficient conditions under which the topological \mathbb{Z}-Bruck-Reilly (\mathbb{Z}-Bruck) extension admits only the direct sum topology and conditions under which the direct sum topology can be coarsened are given. Also, topological characterizations of some classes of I-bisimple (semi)topological semigroups are given.
