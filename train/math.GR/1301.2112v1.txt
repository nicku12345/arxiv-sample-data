Let S be a finitely generated pro-p group. Let \Emb(S) be the class of profinite groups G that have S as a Sylow subgroup, and such that S intersects non-trivially with every non-trivial normal subgroup of G. In this paper, we investigate the question of whether or not \Emb(S) has finitely many isomorphism classes. For instance, we give an example where \Emb(S) contains an infinite ascending chain of soluble groups, and on the other hand show that \Emb(S) contains only finitely many isomorphism classes in the case that S is just infinite.
