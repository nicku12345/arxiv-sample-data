In this paper we describe a portion of the subsemigroup lattice of the \emph{full transformation semigroup} \Omega^\Omega, which consists of all mappings on the countable infinite set \Omega. Gavrilov showed that there are five maximal subsemigroups of \Omega^\Omega containing the symmetric group \sym(\Omega). The portion of the subsemigroup lattice of \Omega^\Omega which we describe is that between the intersection of these five maximal subsemigroups and \Omega^\Omega. We prove that there are only 38 subsemigroups in this interval, in contrast to the 2^{2^{\aleph_0}} subsemigroups between \sym(\Omega) and \Omega^\Omega.
