Let 2 \leq a \leq b \leq c \in \mathbb{N} with \mu=1/a+1/b+1/c<1 and let T=T_{a,b,c}=< x,y,z: x^a=y^b=z^c=xyz=1> be the corresponding hyperbolic triangle group. Many papers have been dedicated to the following question: what are the finite (simple) groups which appear as quotients of T? (Classically, for (a,b,c)=(2,3,7) and more recently also for general (a,b,c).) These papers have used either explicit constructive methods or probabilistic ones. The goal of this paper is to present a new approach based on the theory of representation varieties (via deformation theory). As a corollary we essentially prove a conjecture of Marion [21] showing that various finite simple groups are not quotients of T, as well as positive results showing that many finite simple groups are quotients of T.
