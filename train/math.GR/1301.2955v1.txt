This paper is a continuation of our first paper [10] in which we showed how deformation theory of representation varieties can be used to study finite simple quotients of triangle groups. While in Part I, we mainly used deformations of the principal homomorphism from {\rm SO}(3,\R), in this part we use {\rm PGL}_2(\R) as well as deformations of representations which are very different from the principal homomorphism.
