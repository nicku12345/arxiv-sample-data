We exhibit a simple condition under which a finite involutary semigroup whose semigroup reduct is inherently nonfinitely based is also inherently nonfinitely based as a unary semigroup. As applications, we get already known as well as new examples of inherently nonfinitely based involutory semigroups. We also show that for finite regular semigroups, our condition is not only sufficient but also necessary for the property of being inherently nonfinitely based to persist. This leads to an algorithmic description of regular inherently nonfinitely based involutory semigroups.
