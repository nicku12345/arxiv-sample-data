We discuss whether finiteness properties of a profinite group G can be deduced from the coefficients of the probabilistic zeta function P_G(s). In particular we prove that if P_G(s) is rational and all but finitely many non abelian composition factors of G are isomorphic to PSL(2,p) for some prime p, then G contains only finitely many maximal subgroups.
