We consider two families of subgroups of a group. Each subgroup which belongs to one family is contained in some subgroup which belongs to the other family. We then discuss relations of relative hyperbolicity for the group with respect to the two families, respectively. If the group is supposed to be hyperbolic relative to the two families, respectively, then we consider relations of relative quasiconvexity for a subgroup of the group with respect to the two families, respectively.
