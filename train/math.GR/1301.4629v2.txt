In this paper we study the residual nilpotence of groups defined by basic commutators. We prove that the so-called Hydra groups as well as certain of their generalizations and quotients are, in the main, residually torsion-free nilpotent. By way of contrast we give an example of a group defined by two basic commutators which is not residually torsion-free nilpotent.
