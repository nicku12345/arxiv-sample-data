Let H be a subgroup of a finite group G. We say that H satisfies partial \Pi-property in G if there exists a chief series \mathit{\Gamma}_G:1=G_0<G_1<\cdots<G_n=G of G such that for every G-chief factor G_i/G_{i-1} (1\leq i\leq n) of \mathit{\Gamma}_G, |G/G_{i-1}:N_{G/G_{i-1}}(HG_{i-1}/G_{i-1}\cap G_i/G_{i-1})| is a \pi(HG_{i-1}/G_{i-1}\cap G_i/G_{i-1})-number. Our main results are listed here:   Theorem A. Let \mathfrak{F} be a solubly saturated formation containing \mathfrak{U} and E a normal subgroup of G with G/E\in \mathfrak{F}. Let X\unlhd G such that F_p^*(E)\leq X\leq E. Suppose that for any Sylow p-subgroup P of X, every maximal subgroup of P satisfies partial \Pi-property in G. Then one of the following holds:   (1) G\in \mathfrak{G}_{p'}\mathfrak{F}.   (2) X/O_{p'}(X) is a quasisimple group with Sylow p-subgroups of order p. In particular, if X=F_p^*(E), then X/O_{p'}(X) is a simple group.   Theorem B. Let \mathfrak{F} be a solubly saturated formation containing \mathfrak{U} and E a normal subgroup of G with G/E\in \mathfrak{F}. Suppose that for any Sylow p-subgroup P of F_p^*(E), every cyclic subgroup of P of prime order or order 4 (when P is not quaternion-free) satisfies partial \Pi-property in G. Then G\in \mathfrak{G}_{p'}\mathfrak{F}.
