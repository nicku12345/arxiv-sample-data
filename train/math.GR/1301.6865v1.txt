Let G be a finite group. A subgroup H of G is said to be weakly S-embedded in G if there exists K\unlhd G such that HK is S-quasinormal in G and H\cap K\leq H_{seG}, where H_{seG} is the subgroup generated by all those subgroups of H which are S-quasinormally embedded in G. We say that H is weakly \tau-embedded in G if there exists K\unlhd G such that HK is S-quasinormal in G and H\cap K\leq H_{\tau G}, where H_{\tau G} is the subgroup generated by all those subgroups of H which are \tau-quasinormal in G. In this paper, we study the properties of the weakly S-embedded subgroups and the weakly \tau-embedded subgroups, and use them to determine the structure of finite groups.
