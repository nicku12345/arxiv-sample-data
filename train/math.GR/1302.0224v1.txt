The concept of a weak factorization system has been studied extensively in homotopy theory and has recently found an application in one of the proofs of the celebrated flat cover conjecture, categorical versions of which have been presented by a number of authors including Rosicky [15]. One of the main aims of this paper is to draw attention to this interesting concept and to initiate a study of these systems in relation to flatness of S-acts and related concepts.
