We prove that every monoid \mathrm{Mon}\langle a,b:a^{\alpha}b^{\beta}a^{\gamma}b^{\delta}=b\rangle admits a finite complete rewriting system. Furthermore we prove that \mathrm{Mon}\langle a,b:ab^2a^2b^2=b\rangle is non-hopfian, providing an example of a finitely presented non-residually finite monoid with linear Dehn function.
