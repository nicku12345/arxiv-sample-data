In this note we introduce the class of \mathcal H-groups (or Hall groups) related to the class of \mathcal B-groups defined by Ph. Hall in 1950's. Establishing some basic properties of Hall groups we use them to obtain results concerning embeddings of abelian groups. In particular, we give an explicit classification of all abelian groups that can occur as subgroups in finitely-generated metabelian groups. Hall groups allow to give a negative answer to the Baumslag's conjecture of 1990 on the cardinality of the set of isomorphism classes for abelian subgroups in finitely generated metabelian groups.
