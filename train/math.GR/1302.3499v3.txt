Suppose that a finite p-group P admits a Frobenius group of automorphisms FH with kernel F that is a cyclic p-group and with complement H. It is proved that if the fixed-point subgroup C_P(H) of the complement is nilpotent of class c, then P has a characteristic subgroup of index bounded in terms of c, |C_P(F)|, and |F| whose nilpotency class is bounded in terms of c and |H| only. Examples show that the condition of F being cyclic is essential. The proof is based on a Lie ring method and a theorem of the authors and P. Shumyatsky about Lie rings with a metacyclic Frobenius group of automorphisms FH. It is also proved that P has a characteristic subgroup of (|C_P(F)|, |F|)-bounded index whose order and rank are bounded in terms of |H| and the order and rank of C_P(H), respectively, and whose exponent is bounded in terms of the exponent of C_P(H).
