We initiate the study of some pro-p-groups arising from infinite-dimensional Lie theory. These groups are completions of some subgroups of incomplete Kac-Moody groups over finite fields, with respect to various completions of algebraic or geometric origin. We show topological finite generation for the pro-p Sylow subgroups in many complete Kac-Moody groups. This implies abstract simplicity of the latter groups. We also discuss with the question of (non-)linearity of these pro-p groups.
