The spectrum of a group is the set of its element orders. A finite group G is said to be recognizable by spectrum if every finite group that has the same spectrum as G is isomorphic to G. We prove that the simple alternating groups A_n are recognizable by spectrum when n\neq 6, 10. This implies that every finite group with the same spectrum as that of a finite nonabelian simple group, has at most one nonabelian composition factor
