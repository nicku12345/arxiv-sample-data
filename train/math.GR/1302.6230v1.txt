We will study the presentations of fundamental groups of the complement of complexified real affine line arrangements that do not contain two parallel lines. By Yoshinaga's minimal presentation, we can give positive homogeneous presentations of the fundamental groups. We consider the associated monoids defined by the presentations. It turns out that, in some cases, left (resp. right) \emph{least common multiple} does not always exist. Hence, the monoids are neither \emph{Garside} nor \emph{Artin}. Nevertheless, we will show that they carry certain particular elements similar to the \emph{fundamental elements} in Artin monoids, and that, by improving the classical method in combinatorial group theory, they are \emph{cancellative monoids}. As a result, we will show that the word problem can be solved and the center of them are determined.
