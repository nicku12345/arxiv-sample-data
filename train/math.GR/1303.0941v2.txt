We study twisted conjugacy classes of the unit element in different groups. Fel'shtyn and Troitsky showed that the twisted conjugacy class of the unit element of an abelian group is a subgroup for every automorphism. The structure is investigated of a group whose twisted conjugacy class of the unit element is a subgroup for every automorphism (inner automorphism).
