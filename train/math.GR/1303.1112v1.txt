This paper studies automatic structures for subsemigroups of Baumslag--Solitar semigroups (that is, semigroups presented by \ < x,y \mid (yx^m, x^ny)\ >, where m and n are natural numbers). A geometric argument (a rarity in the field of automatic semigroups) is used to show that if m \gt n, all of the finitely generated subsemigroups of this semigroup are [right-] automatic. If m \lt n, all of its finitely generated subsemigroups are left-automatic. If m = n, there exist finitely generated subsemigroups that are not automatic. An appendix discusses the implications of these results for the theory of Malcev presentations. (A Malcev presentation is a special type of presentation for semigroups embeddable into groups.)
