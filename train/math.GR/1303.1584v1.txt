Let G be a finite group. We show that the order of the subgroup generated by coprime \gamma_k-commutators (respectively \delta_k-commutators) is bounded in terms of the size of the set of coprime \gamma_k-commutators (respectively \delta_k-commutators). This is in parallel with the classical theorem due to Turner-Smith that the words \gamma_k and \delta_k are concise.
