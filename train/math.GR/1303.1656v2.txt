We show that any finitely generated group F with infinitely many ends is not a group of fractions of any finitely generated proper subsemigroup P, that is F cannot be expressed as a product P P^{-1}. In particular this solves a conjecture of Navas in the positive. As a corollary we obtain a new proof of the fact that finitely generated free groups do not admit isolated left-invariant orderings.
