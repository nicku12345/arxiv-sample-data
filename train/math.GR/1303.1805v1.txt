We compute the number of irreducible linear representations of self-similar branch groups, by expressing these numbers as the co\"efficients a_n of a Dirichlet series sum a_n n^{-s}.   We show that this Dirichlet series has a positive abscissa of convergence, is algebraic over the ring Q[2^{-s},...,P^{-s}] for some integer P, and show that it can be analytically continued (through root singularities) to the left half-plane.   We compute the abscissa of convergence and the functional equation for some prominent examples of branch groups, such as the Grigorchuk and Gupta-Sidki groups.
