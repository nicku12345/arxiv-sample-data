This paper is concerned with discrete, uniform subgroups (lattices) of oscillator groups, which are certain semidirect products of the Heisenberg group and the additive group of real numbers. The present paper rectifies the uncertainties in [1] of Medina and Revoy and gives a complete classification of the lattices of the 4-dimensional oscillator group up to isomorphism.
