The homology groups introduced by A. Brumer can be used to establish a criterion ensuring that a profinite \mathbb{F}_p[[G]]-module of a pro-p group G has projective dimension d<\infty (cf. Thm. A). This criterion yields a new characterization of free pro-p groups (cf. Cor. B). Applied to a semi-direct factor G\to\mathbb{Z}_p\to G isomorphic to \mathbb{Z}_p which defines a non-trivial end in the sense of A.A. Korenev one concludes that the closure of the normal closure of the image of \sigma is a free pro-p subgroup (cf. Thm. C). From this result we will deduce a structure theorem (cf. Thm. D) for finitely generated pro-p groups with infinitely many ends.
