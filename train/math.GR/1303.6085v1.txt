We classify all strongly real conjugacy classes of the finite unitary group \U(n, F_q) when q is odd. In particular, we show that g \in \U(n, F_q) is strongly real if and only if g is an element of some embedded orthogonal group O^{\pm}(n, F_q). Equivalently, g is strongly real in \U(n, F_q) if and only if g is real and every elementary divisor of g of the form (t \pm 1)^{2m} has even multiplicity. We apply this to obtain partial results on strongly real classes in the finite symplectic group \Sp(2n, F_q), q odd, and a generating function for the number of strongly real classes in \U(n, F_q), q odd, and we also give partial results on strongly real classes in \U(n, F_q) when q is even.
