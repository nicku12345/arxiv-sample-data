We say that a group G is acylindrically hyperbolic if it admits a non-elementary acylindrical action on a hyperbolic space. We prove that the class of acylindrically hyperbolic groups coincides with many other classes studied in the literature, e.g., the class C_{geom} introduced by Hamenstadt, the class of groups admitting a non-elementary weakly properly discontinuous action on a hyperbolic space in the sense of Bestvina and Fujiwara, and the class of groups with hyperbolically embedded subgroups studied by Dahmani, Guirardel, and the author. We also record some basic results about acylindrically hyperbolic groups for future use.
