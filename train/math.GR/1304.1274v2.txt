Given an action of a group G on a topological space X, we establish a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a free subgroup F of rank 2 of G acting properly discontinuously on at least one nonempty, open, F-invariant subspace of X. In the case of a discrete topology (group action on a set X), the condition simply detects free subgroups of rank 2 acting freely on some orbit.
