The Andrews-Curtis conjecture asserts that, for a free group F_n of rank n and a free basis (x_1,...,x_n), any normally generating tuple (y_1,...,y_n) is Andrews-Curtis equivalent to (x_1,...,x_n). This equivalence corresponds to the actions of \operatorname{Aut}F_n and of F_n on normally generating n-tuples. The equivalence corresponding to the action of \operatorname{Aut}F_n on generating n-tuples is called Nielsen equivalence. The conjecture for arbitrary finitely generated group has its own importance to analyse potential counter-examples to the original conjecture. We study the Andrews-Curtis and Nielsen equivalence in the class of finitely generated groups for which every maximal subgroup is normal, including nilpotent groups and Grigorchuk groups.
