Given a \Gamma-semigroup S, we construct a semigroup \Sigma in such a way that one sided ideals and quasi-ideals of S can be regarded as one sided ideals and quasi-ideals respectively of \Sigma. This correspondence and other properties of \Sigma, allow us to obtain several results for S without having the need to work directly with it, but solely employing well known results of semigroup theory. For example, we obtain the Green's theorem for \Gamma-semigroups found in \cite{PT}, as a corollary of the usual Green's theorem in semigroups. Also we prove that, if S is a \Gamma-semigroup and \gamma_{0} \in \Gamma such that S_{\gamma_{0}} is a completely simple semigroup, then for every \gamma \in \Gamma, S_{\gamma} is completely simple too.
