Given a finitely presented group G, we wish to explore the conditions under which automorphisms of quotients G/N can be lifted to automorphisms of G. We discover that in the case where N is a central subgroup of G, the question of lifting can be reduced to solving a certain matrix equation. We then use the techniques developed to show that Inn(G) is not characteristic in Aut(G), where G is a metacyclic group of order p^n, p\neq 2.
