We prove that monoids \mathrm{Mon}\langle a,b,c,d : a^nb=0, ac=1, db=1, dc=1, dab=1, da^2b=1, \ldots, da^{n-1}b=1\rangle are congruence-free for all n\geq 1. This provides a new countable family of finitely presented congruence-free monoids, bringing one step closer to understanding the Boone--Higman Conjecture. We also provide examples which show that finitely presented congruence-free monoids may have quadratic Dehn function.
