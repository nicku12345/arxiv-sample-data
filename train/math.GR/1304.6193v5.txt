For any locally compact group G, we show the existence and uniqueness up to quasi-equivalence of a unitary C_0-representation \pi_0 of G such that all coefficient functions of C_0-representations of G are coefficient functions of \pi_0. The present work, strongly influenced by the work of N. Brown and E. Guentner (which dealt exclusively with discrete groups), leads to new characterizations of the Haagerup property: if G is second countable, then it has that property if and only if the representation \pi_0 induces a *-isomorphism of C^*(G) onto C^*_{\pi_0}(G). When G is discrete, we also relate the Haagerup property to relative strong mixing properties of the group von Neumann algebra L(G) into finite von Neumann algebras.
