Let G be the multiplicative group generated by the gamma functions \Gamma(ax+1) (a=1,2,\dots), and H be the subgroup of all elements of G that converge to nonzero constants as x\rightarrow\infty. The quotient group G/H is the group of equivalence classes of G, where f and g are equivalent \iff f\sim Cg (x\rightarrow\infty) for some C\not=0. We show that G/H\simeq\mathbb{Q}^+. A similar consideration is possible for the case that the gamma functions \Gamma(ax+1) with a\in\mathbb{R}^+ are concerned, and we show that G/H\simeq\mathbb{Z}\times\mathbb{R}\times\mathbb{R}.   Also, several concrete examples of the elements of H are constructed, e.g., it holds that \frac{\binom{18n}{12n,3n,3n}}{\binom{18n}{9n,8n,n}}\longrightarrow\sqrt{\frac{2}{3}} (n\rightarrow\infty), where \binom{*}{*,\dots,*} denotes a multinomial coefficient.
