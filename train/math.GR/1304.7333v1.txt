The Gruenberg-Kegel graph {\rm GK}(G)=(V_G, E_G) of a finite group G is a simple graph with vertex set V_G=\pi(G), the set of all primes dividing the order of G, and such that two distinct vertices p and q are joined by an edge, \{p, q\}\in E_G, if G contains an element of order pq. The degree {\rm deg}_G(p) of a vertex p\in V_G is the number of edges incident on p. In the case when \pi(G)=\{p_1, p_2,..., p_h\} with p_1< p_2< ... < p_h, we consider the h-tuple D(G)=({\rm deg}_G(p_1), {\rm deg}_G(p_2),..., {\rm deg}_G(p_h)), which is called the degree pattern of G. The group G is called k-fold OD-characterizable if there exist exactly k non-isomorphic groups H satisfying condition (|H|, D(H))=(|G|, D(G)). Especially, a 1-fold OD-characterizable group is simply called OD-characterizable. In this paper, we first find the degree pattern of the projevtive special linear groups over binary field L_n(2) and among other results we prove that the simple groups L_{10}(2) and L_{11}(2) are OD-characterizable (Theorem \ref{10-11}). It is also shown that automorphism groups {\rm Aut}(L_p(2)) and {\rm Aut}(L_{p+1}(2)), where 2^p-1 is a Mersenne prime, are OD-characterizable (Theorem \ref{auto}).
