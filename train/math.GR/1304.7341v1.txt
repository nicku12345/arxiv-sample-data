The prime graph of a finite group G, which is denoted by {\rm GK}(G), is a simple graph whose vertex set is comprised of the prime divisors of |G| and two distinct prime divisors p and q are joined by an edge if and only if there exists an element of order pq in G. Let p_1<p_2<...<p_k be all prime divisors of |G|. Then the degree pattern of G is defined as {\rm D}(G)=(deg_G(p_1), deg_G(p_2),..., deg_G(p_k)), where deg_G(p) signifies the degree of the vertex p in {\rm GK}(G). A finite group H is said to be OD-characterizable if G\cong H for every finite group G such that |G|=|H| and {\rm D}(G)={\rm D}(H). The purpose of this article is threefold. First, it finds sharp upper and lower bounds on \vartheta(G), the sum of degrees of all vertices in {\rm GK}(G), for any finite group G (Theorem 2.1). Second, it provides the degree of vertices 2 and the characteristic p of the base field of any finite simple group of Lie type in their prime graphs (Propositions 3.1-3.7). Third, it proves the linear groups L_4(19), L_4(23), L_4(27), L_4(29), L_4(31), L_4(32) and L_4(37) are OD-characterizable (Theorem 4.2).
