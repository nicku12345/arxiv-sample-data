Given a finite group G, denote by {\rm D}(G) the degree pattern of G and by {\rm OC}(G) the set of all order components of G. Denote by h_{{\rm OD}}(G) (resp. h_{{\rm OC}}(G)) the number of isomorphism classes of finite groups H satisfying conditions |H|=|G| and {\rm D}(H)={\rm D}(G) (resp. {\rm OC}(H)={\rm OC}(G)). A finite group G is called OD-characterizable (resp. OC-characterizable) if h_{\rm OD}(G)=1 (resp. h_{\rm OC}(G)=1). Let C=C_p(2) be a symplectic group over binary field, for which 2^p-1>7 is a Mersenne prime. The aim of this article is to prove that h_{\rm OD}(C)=1=h_{\rm OC}(C).
