Let \lambda=(\lambda_1,\lambda_2,...) be a \emph{partition} of n, a sequence of positive integers in non-increasing order with sum n. Let \Omega:=\{1,...,n\}. An ordered partition P=(A_1,A_2,...) of \Omega has \emph{type} \lambda if |A_i|=\lambda_i.   Following Martin and Sagan, we say that G is \emph{\lambda-transitive} if, for any two ordered partitions P=(A_1,A_2,...) and Q=(B_1,B_2,...) of \Omega of type \lambda, there exists g\in G with A_ig=B_i for all i. A group G is said to be \emph{\lambda-homogeneous} if, given two ordered partitions P and Q as above, inducing the sets P'=\{A_1,A_2,...\} and Q'=\{B_1,B_2,...\}, there exists g\in G such that P'g=Q'. Clearly a \lambda-transitive group is \lambda-homogeneous.   The first goal of this paper is to classify the \lambda-homogeneous groups. The second goal is to apply this classification to a problem in semigroup theory.   Let \trans and \sym denote the transformation monoid and the symmetric group on \Omega, respectively. Fix a group H\leq \sym. Given a non-invertible transformation a\in \trans\setminus \sym and a group G\leq \sym, we say that (a,G) is an \emph{H-pair} if the semigroups generated by \{a\}\cup H and \{a\}\cup G contain the same non-units, that is, < a,G>\setminus G=< a,H>\setminus H. Using the classification of the \lambda-homogeneous groups we classify all the \sym-pairs.   This topic involves both group theory and semigroup theory; we have attempted to include enough exposition to make the paper self-contained for researchers in both areas.   The paper finishes with a number of open problems on permutation and linear groups.
