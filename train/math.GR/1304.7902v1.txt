Let H and B be subgroups of a finite group G such that G=N_{G}(H)B. Then we say that H is \emph{quasipermutable} (respectively \emph{S-quasipermutable}) in G provided H permutes with B and with every subgroup (respectively with every Sylow subgroup) A of B such that (|H|, |A|)=1. In this paper we analyze the influence of S-quasipermutable and quasipermutable subgroups on the structure of G. As an application, we give new characterizations of soluble PST-groups.
