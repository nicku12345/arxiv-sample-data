Let R be a connected noetherian commutative ring, and let G be a simply connected reductive group over R of isotropic rank ge 2. The elementary subgroup E(R) of G(R) is the subgroup generated by the R-points U_P^+(R) and U_P^-(R) of the unipotent radicals of two opposite parabolic subgroups P^+ and P^- of G. Assume that 2 is invertible in R if G is of type B_n,C_n,F_4,G_2 and 3 is invertible in R if G is of type G_2. We prove that the congruence kernel of E(R), defined as the kernel of the natural homomorphism between the profinite completion of E(R) and the congruence completion of E(R) with respect to congruence subgroups of finite index, is central. In the course of the proof, we construct Steinberg groups associated to isotropic reductive groups and show that they are central extensions of E(R) if R is a local ring.
