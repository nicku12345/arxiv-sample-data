Let {\rm GK}(G) be the prime graph associated with a finite group G and D(G) be the degree pattern of G. A finite group G is said to be k-fold OD-characterizable if there exist exactly k non-isomorphic groups H such that |H|=|G| and D(H)=D(G). A 1-fold OD-characterizable group is simply called OD-characterizable. The purpose of this paper is threefold. First, it provides the reader with a few useful and efficient tools on OD-characterizability of finite groups. Second, it lists a number of such simple groups that have been already investigated. Third, it shows that the simple groups L_6(3) and U_4(5) are OD-characterizable, too.
