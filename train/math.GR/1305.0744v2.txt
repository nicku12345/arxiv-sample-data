We consider the class \mathfrak M of \bf R--modules where \bf R is an associative ring. Let A be a module over a group ring \bf RG where G is a group and let \mathfrak L(G) be a set of all proper subgroups of G such that if H \in \mathfrak L(G) then A/C_{A}(H) belongs to \mathfrak M. We study an \bf RG--module A such that G \not = G', C_{G}(A) = 1, A/C_{A}(G) \not \in \mathfrak M, and \mathfrak M is one of the classes: artinian \bf R--modules, minimax \bf R--modules, finite \bf R--modules. We consider the cases: 1) \mathfrak M is a class of all artinian \bf R--modules, \bf R is either a ring of integers or a ring of p--adic integers; 2) \mathfrak M is a class of all minimax \bf R--modules, \bf R is a ring of integers, G is a locally soluble group; 3) \mathfrak M is a class of all finite \bf R--modules, \bf R is an associative ring. In these cases we prove that G is isomorphic to a quasi--cyclic q--group for some prime q.
