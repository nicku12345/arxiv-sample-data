Let G be a finite group, and c an element of \mathbb{Z}\cup \{\infty\}. A subgroup H of G is said to be {\it c-nilpotent} if it is nilpotent, and has nilpotency class at most c. A subset X of G is said to be {\it non-c-nilpotent} if it contains no two elements x and y such that the subgroup < x,y> is c-nilpotent. In this paper we study the quantity \omega_c(G), defined to be the size of the largest non-c-nilpotent subset of L.   In the case that L is a finite group of Lie type, we identify covers of L by c-nilpotent subgroups, and we use these covers to construct large non-c-nilpotent sets in L. We prove that for groups L of fixed rank r, there exist constants D_r and E_r such that D_r N \leq \omega_\infty(L) \leq E_r N, where N is the number of maximal tori in L.   In the case of groups L with twisted rank 1, we provide exact formulae for \omega_c(L) for all c\in\mathbb{Z}\cup \{\infty\}. If we write q for the level of the Frobenius endomorphism associated with L and assume that q>5, then \omega_\infty(G) may be expressed as a polynomial in q with coefficients in \{0,1\}.
