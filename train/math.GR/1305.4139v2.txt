Given a saturated fusion system \mathcal{F} over a 2-group S, we prove that S is abelian provided any element of S is \mathcal{F}-conjugate to an element of Z(S). This generalizes a Theorem of Camina--Herzog, leading to a significant simplification of its proof. More importantly, it follows that any 2-block B of a finite group has abelian defect groups if all B-subsections are major. Furthermore, every 2-block with a symmetric stable center has abelian defect groups.
