It is shown that a finitely generated pro-p group G which is a virtually free pro-p product splits either as a free pro-p product with amalgamation or as a pro-p HNN-extension over a finite p-group. More precisely, G is the pro-p fundamental group of a finite graph of finitely generated pro-p groups with finite edge groups. This generalizes previous results of W. Herfort and the second author (cf. [2]).
