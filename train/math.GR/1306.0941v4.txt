We prove that in a torsion-free hyperbolic group \Gamma, the length of the value of each variable in a minimal solution of a quadratic equation Q=1 is bounded by N|Q|^3 for an orientable equation, and by N|Q|^{4} for a non-orientable equation, where |Q| is the length of the equation, and the constant N can be computed. We show that the problem, whether a quadratic equation in \Gamma has a solution, is in NP, and that there is a PSpace algorithm for solving arbitrary equations in \Gamma. If additionally \Gamma is non-cyclic, then this problem (of deciding existence of a solution) is NP-complete. We also give a slightly larger bound for minimal solutions of quadratic equations in a toral relatively hyperbolic group.
