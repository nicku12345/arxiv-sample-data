A subgroup H of a group G is called weakly s-supplemented in G if there is a subgroup T such that G=HT and H\cap T\le H_{sG}, where H_{sG} is the subgroup of H generated by all those subgroups of H which are s-permutable in G. The influence of primary weakly s-supplemented subgroups on the structure of finite groups is investigated. An open question promoted by Skiba is studied and some known results are generalized.
