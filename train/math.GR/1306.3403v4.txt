The observation that the 0-dimensional Geometric Invariant \Sigma ^{0}(G;A) of Bieri-Neumann-Strebel-Renz can be interpreted as a horospherical limit set opens a direct trail from Poincar\'e's limit set \Lambda (\Gamma) of a discrete group \Gamma  of M\"obius transformations (which contains the horospherical limit set of \Gamma ) to the roots of tropical geometry (closely related to \Sigma ^{0}(G;A) when G is abelian). We explore this trail by introducing the horospherical limit set, \Sigma (M;A), of a G-module A when G acts by isometries on a proper CAT(0) metric space M. This is a subset of the boundary at infinity of M. On the way we meet instances where \Sigma (M;A) is the set of all conical limit points, the complement of a spherical building, the complement of the radial projection of a tropical variety, or (via the Bieri-Neumann-Strebel invariant) where it is closely related to the Thurston norm.
