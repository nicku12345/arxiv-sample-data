We introduce the notion of commability between locally compact groups, namely the equivalence relation generated by cocompact inclusions and quotients by compact normal subgroups. We give a classification of focal hyperbolic locally compact groups up to commability. In the mixed case, it involves a real parameter, which is shown to be a quasi-isometry invariant.
