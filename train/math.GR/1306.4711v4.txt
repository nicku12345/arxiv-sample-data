This is the fourth and last in a series of four papers (with research announcement posted on this arXiv) that develop a decomposition theory for subgroups of \text{Out}(F_n). In this paper we develop general ping-pong techniques for the action of \text{Out}(F_n) on the space of lines of F_n. Using these techniques we prove the main results stated in the research announcement, Theorem C and its special case Theorem I, the latter of which says that for any finitely generated subgroup \mathcal H of \text{Out}(F_n) that acts trivially on homology with \mathbb{Z}/3 coefficients, and for any free factor system \mathcal F that does not consist of (the conjugacy classes of) a complementary pair of free factors of F_n nor of a rank n-1 free factor, if \mathcal H is fully irreducible relative to \mathcal F then \mathcal H has an element that is fully irreducible relative to \mathcal F. We also prove Theorem J which, under the additional hypothesis that \mathcal H is geometric relative to \mathcal F, describes a strong relation between \mathcal H and a mapping class group of a surface.   v3 and 4: Strengthened statements of the main theorems, highlighting the role of the finite generation hypothesis, and providing an alternative hypothesis. Strengthened proofs of lamination ping-pong, and a strengthened conclusion in Theorem J, for further applications.
