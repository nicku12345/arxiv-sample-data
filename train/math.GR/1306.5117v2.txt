Following [23], denote by \mathfrak{F}_0 the functor on the category \mathbf{TAG} of all Hausdorff Abelian topological groups and continuous homomorphisms which passes each X\in \mathbf{TAG} to the group of all X-valued null sequences endowed with the uniform topology. We prove that if X\in \mathbf{TAG} is an (E)-space (respectively, a strictly angelic space or a \v{S}-space), then \mathfrak{F}_0 (X) is an (E)-space (respectively, a strictly angelic space or a \v{S}-space). We study respected properties for topological groups in particular from categorical point of view. Using this investigation we show that for a locally compact Abelian (LCA) group X the following are equivalent: 1) X is totally disconnected, 2) \mathfrak{F}_0 (X) is a Schwartz group, 3) \mathfrak{F}_0 (X) respects compactness, 4) \mathfrak{F}_0(X) has the Schur property. So, if a LCA group X has non-zero connected component, the group \mathfrak{F}_0(X) is a reflexive non-Schwartz group which does not have the Schur property. We prove also that for every compact connected metrizable Abelian group X the group \mathfrak{F}_0 (X) is monothetic that generalizes a result by Rolewicz for X=\mathbb{T}.
