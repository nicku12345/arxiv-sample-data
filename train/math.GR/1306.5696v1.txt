For any choice of a basis \cal A the free group F_N of finite rank N \geq 2 can be canonically identified with the set F(\cal A) of reduced words in \cal A\cup \cal A^{-1}. However, such a word w \in F(\cal A) admits a second interpretation, namely as cylinder C^1_w \subset \partial F_N. The subset of \partial F_N defined by C^1_w depends not only on the element of F_N given by the word w, but also on the chosen basis \cal A. In particular one has in general, for \Phi \in \Aut(F_N): \Phi(C^1_w) \neq C^1_{\Phi(w)} Indeed, the image of a cylinder under an automorphism \Phi \in \Aut(F_N) is in general not a cylinder, but a finite union of cylinders: \Phi (C^1_w)=C^{1}_U := \bigcup_{u_i \in U} C^1_{u_i} In his thesis the first author has given an efficient algorithm and a formula how to determine such a (uniquely determined) finite {\em reduced} set U = U(w) \subset F_N. We use those to define the dual automorphism \Phi_{\cal A}^* by setting \Phi_{\cal A}^*(w) = U(w).   \smallskip \noindent {\bf Theorem:} {\it For any \Phi \in \Aut(F_N) there are at most 2N distinct finite subsets U_i \subset F_N such that for any w = y_1 ... y_r \in F_A there is one of them, say U_{i(w)}, with \Phi_{\cal A}^*(w) = \Phi(w) U_{i(w)}\, , and U_{i(w)} depends only on the last letter y_r \in \CA \cup \CA^{-1}. Furthermore, the seize of each U_{i} is bounded by 2^t, where t \geq 0 is the number of Nielsen automorphisms in any decomposition of \Phi as product of basis permutations, basis inversions and elementary Nielsen automorphisms.}
