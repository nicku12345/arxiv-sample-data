A subgroup H of a finite group G is said to satisfy \Pi-property in G if for every chief factor L/K of G, |G/K:N_{G/K}(HK/K\cap L/K)| is a \pi(HK/K\cap L/K)-number. A subgroup H of G is called to be \Pi-supplemented in G if there exists a subgroup T of G such that G=HT and H\cap T\leq I\leq H, where I satisfies \Pi-property in G. In this paper, we investigate the structure of a finite group G under the assumption that some primary subgroups of G are \Pi-supplemented in G. The main result we proved improves a large number of earlier results.
