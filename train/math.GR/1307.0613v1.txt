In [10] Benjamin Klopsch and Ilir Snopce posted the conjecture that for p\geq 3 and G a torsion-free pro-p group d(G)=\dim (G) is a sufficient and necessary condition for the pro-p group G to be uniform. They pointed out that this follows from the more general question of whether for a finite p-group d(G)=\log_p(|\Omega_1(G)|) is a sufficient and necessary condition for the group G to be powerful. In this short note we will give a positive answer to this question for p\geq 5.
