The Bogomolov multiplier B_0(G) of a finite group G is defined as the subgroup of the Schur multiplier consisting of the cohomology classes vanishing after restriction to all abelian subgroups of G. The triviality of the Bogomolov multiplier is an obstruction to Noether's problem. We show that if G is a central product of G_1 and G_2, regarding K_i\leq Z(G_i), i=1,2, and \theta:G_1\to G_2 is a group homomorphism such that its restriction \theta\vert_{K_1}:K_1\to K_2 is an isomorphism, then the triviality of B_0(G_1/K_1), B_0(G_1) and B_0(G_2) implies the triviality of B_0(G). We give a positive answer to Noether's problem for all 2-generator p-groups of nilpotency class 2, and for one series of 4-generator p-groups of nilpotency class 2 (with the usual requirement for the roots of unity).
