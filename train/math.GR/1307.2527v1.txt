We give another proof of an observation of Th\'evenaz \cite{T1989} and present a fusion system version of it. Namely, for a saturated fusion system \CF on a finite p-group S, we show that the number of the \CF-conjugacy classes of cyclic subgroups of S is equal to the rank of certain square matrices of numbers of orbits, coming from characteristic bisets, the characteristic idempotent and finite groups realizing the fusion system \CF as in our previous work \cite{P2010}.
