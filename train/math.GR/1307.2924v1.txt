Let G be a finite group. For x \in G, we define the solvabilizer of x in G, denoted sol_G(x), to be the set \{g \in G \mid \langle g,x \rangle is solvable\}. A group G is an S-group if sol_G(x) is a subgroup of G for every x \in G. In this paper we prove that G is solvable \Leftrightarrow G is an S-group. Secondly, we define the non-solvable graph of G (denoted {\mathcal S}_{G}). Its vertices are G and there is an edge between x,y \in G whenever \langle x,y \rangle is not solvable. If S(G) is the solvable radical of G and G is not solvable, we look at the induced graph over G \setminus S(G), denoted \hat{{\mathcal S}_{G}}. We prove that if G is not solvable, then \hat{{\mathcal S}_{G}} is irregular. In addition, we prove some properties of solvabilizers and non-solvable graphs.
