A group has finite palindromic width if there exists n such that every element can be expressed as a product of n or fewer palindromic words. We show that if G has finite palindromic width with respect to some generating set, then so does G \wr \mathbb{Z}^{r}. We also give a new, self-contained, proof that finitely generated metabelian groups have finite palindromic width. Finally, we show that solvable groups satisfying the maximal condition on normal subgroups (max-n) have finite palindromic width.
