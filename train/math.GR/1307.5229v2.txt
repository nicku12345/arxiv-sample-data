Let p be a prime integer and n,i be positive integers such that \linebreak S=\{-1, \ \theta, \ \mu_i=1+\theta+... + \theta^{i-1} \ \mid 1 < i < \frac{p^n}{2}, \ gcd(p^n,i)=1 \} generates the group of units of \mathbb{Z}[\theta], where \theta is a primitive {p^n}--th root of unity. Denote by C_{p^n} the cyclic group of order p^n. In this paper we describe explicitly a multiplicatively independent set which generates a complement to \pm C_{p^n} in the group of units of the integral group ring of C_{p^n}.
