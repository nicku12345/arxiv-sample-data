Let H be a subgroup of a group G. H is said satisfying \Pi-property in G, if |G/K:N_{G/K}(HK/K\cap L/K)| is a   \pi(HK/K\cap L/K))-number for any chief factor L/K of G, and, if there is a subnormal supplement T of H in G such that H\cap T\le I\le H for some subgroup I satisfying \Pi-property in G, then H is said \Pi-normal in G. By these properties of some subgroups, we obtain some new criterions of p-nilpotency of finite groups.
