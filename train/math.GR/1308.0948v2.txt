Let \mathfrak{H} be a Fitting class and \mathfrak{F} a formation. We call a subgroup \mathcal{N}_{\mathfrak{H},\mathfrak{F}}(G) of a finite group G the \mathfrak{H}-\mathfrak{F}-norm of G if \mathcal{N}_{\mathfrak{H},\mathfrak{F}}(G) is the intersection of the normalizers of the products of the \mathfrak{F}-residuals of all subgroups of G and the \mathfrak{H}-radical of G. Let \pi denote a set of primes and let \mathfrak{G}_\pi denote the class of all finite \pi-groups. We call the subgroup \mathcal{N}_{\mathfrak{G}_\pi,\mathfrak{F}}(G) of G the \pi\mathfrak{F}-norm of G. A normal subgroup N of G is called \pi\mathfrak{F}-hypercentral in G if either N=1 or N>1 and every G-chief factor below N of order divisible by at least one prime in \pi is \mathfrak{F}-central in G. Let Z_{\pi\mathfrak{F}}(G) denote the \pi\mathfrak{F}-hypercentre of G, that is, the product of all \pi\mathfrak{F}-hypercentral normal subgroups of G. In this paper, we study the properties of the \mathfrak{H}-\mathfrak{F}-norm, especially of the \pi\mathfrak{F}-norm of a finite group G. In particular, we investigate the relationship between the \pi'\mathfrak{F}-norm and the \pi\mathfrak{F}-hypercentre of G.
