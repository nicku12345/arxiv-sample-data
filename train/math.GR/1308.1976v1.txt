Let G be the free product of groups A and B with commuting subgroups H \leqslant A and K \leqslant B, and let C be the class of all finite groups or the class of all finite p-groups. We derive the description of all C-separable cyclic subgroups of G provided this group is residually a C-group. We prove, in particular, that if A, B are finitely generated nilpotent groups and H, K are p'-isolated in the free factors, then all p'-isolated cyclic subgroups of G are separable in the class of all finite p-groups. The same statement is true provided A, B are free and H, K are p'-isolated and cyclic.
