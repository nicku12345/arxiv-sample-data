We consider models of random groups in which the typical group is of intermediate rank (in particular, it is not hyperbolic). These models are parallel to M. Gromov's well-known constructions and include for example a "density model" for groups of intermediate rank. The main novelty is the higher rank nature of the random groups. They are randomization of certain families of lattices in algebraic groups (of rank 2) over local fields.
