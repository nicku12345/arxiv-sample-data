We introduce a class of rings, namely the class of left or right p-nil rings, for which the adjoint groups behave regularly. Every p-ring is close to being left or right p-nil in the sense that it contains a large ideal belonging to this class. Also their adjoint groups occur naturally as groups of automorphisms of p-groups. These facts and some of their applications are investigated in this paper.
