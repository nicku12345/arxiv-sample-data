The genus spectrum of a finite group G is the set of all g\geq 2 such that G acts faithfully and orientation-preserving on a closed compact orientable surface of genus g. This article is an overview of some results relating the genus spectrum of G to its group theoretical properties. In particular, the arithmetical properties of genus spectra are discussed, and explicit results are given on the 2-groups of maximal class, certain sporadic simple groups and a some of the groups PSL(2,q), where q is a small prime power. These results are partially new, and obtained through both theoretical reasoning and application of computational techniques.
