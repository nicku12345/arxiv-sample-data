The motivating question of this paper is roughly the following: given a group scheme G over \mathbb{Z}_p, p prime, with semisimple generic fiber G_{\mathbb{Q}_p}, how far are open subgroups of G(\mathbb{Z}_p) from subgroups of the form X(\mathbb{Z}_p)\mathbf{K}_p(p^n), where X is a subgroup scheme of G and \mathbf{K}_p(p^n) is the principal congruence subgroup \operatorname{Ker} (G(\mathbb{Z}_p)\rightarrow G(\mathbb{Z}/p^n\mathbb{Z}))? More precisely, we will show that for G_{\mathbb{Q}_p} simply connected there exist constants J\ge1 and \varepsilon>0, depending only on G, such that any open subgroup of G (\mathbb{Z}_p) of level p^n admits an open subgroup of index \le J which is contained in X(\mathbb{Z}_p)\mathbf{K}_p(p^{\lceil \varepsilon n\rceil}) for some proper connected algebraic subgroup X of G defined over \mathbb{Q}_p. Moreover, if G is defined over \mathbb{Z}, then \varepsilon and J can be taken independently of p. We also give a correspondence between natural classes of \mathbb{Z}_p-Lie subalgebras of \mathfrak{g}_{\mathbb{Z}_p} and of closed subgroups of G(\mathbb{Z}_p) that can be regarded as a variant over \mathbb{Z}_p of Nori's results on the structure of finite subgroups of \operatorname{GL}(N_0,\mathbb{F}_p) for large p. As an application we give a bound for the volume of the intersection of a conjugacy class in the group G (\hat{\mathbb{Z}}) = \prod_p G (\mathbb{Z}_p), for G defined over \mathbb{Z}, with an arbitrary open subgroup. In a future paper, this result will be applied to the limit multiplicity problem for arbitrary congruence subgroups of the arithmetic lattice G (\mathbb{Z}).
