In this expository paper we describe an unifying approach for many known entropies in Mathematics. First we recall the notion of semigroup entropy h_S in the category S of normed semigroups and contractive homomorphisms, recalling also its properties. For a specific category X and a functor F from X to S, we have the entropy h_F, defined by the composition of h_S with F, which automatically satisfies the same properties proved for h_S. This general scheme permits to obtain many of the known entropies as h_F, for appropriately chosen categories X and functors F. In the last part we recall the definition and the fundamental properties of the algebraic entropy for group endomorphisms, noting how its deeper properties depend on the specific setting. Finally we discuss the notion of growth for flows of groups, comparing it with the classical notion of growth for finitely generated groups.
