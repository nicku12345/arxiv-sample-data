In [12], we show that 3 of the 14 hypergeometric monodromy groups associated to Calabi-Yau threefolds, are arithmetic. Brav-Thomas (in [3]) show that 7 of the remaining 11, are thin. In this article, we settle the arithmeticity problem for the 14 monodromy groups, by showing that, the remaining 4 are arithmetic.
