In this paper we make an attempt to study right loops (S, o) in which, for each y\in S, the map \sigma_y from the inner mapping group G_S of (S, o) to itself given by \sigma_y (h)(x) o\ h(y)= h(xoy), x\in S, h\in G_S is a homomorphism. The concept of twisted automorphisms of a right loop and also the concept of twisted right gyrogroup appears naturally and it turns out that the study is almost equivalent to the study of twisted automorphisms and a twisted right gyrogroup. A representation theorem for twisted right gyrogroup is established. We also study relationship between twisted gyrotransversals and twisted subgroups (a concept which arose as a tool to study computational complexity involving class NP).
