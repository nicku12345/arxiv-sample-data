Let G=\Sp(2g,\mathbb{Z}) be the symplectic group over the integers. Given m\in \mathbb{N}, it is natural to ask if there exists a non-trivial matrix A\in G such that A^{m}=I, where I is the identity matrix in G. In this paper, we determine the possible values of m\in \mathbb{N} for which the above problem has a solution. We also show that there is an upper bound on the maximal order of an element in G. As an illustration, we apply our results to the group \Sp(4,\mathbb{Z}) and determine the possible orders of elements in it. Finally, we use a presentation of \Sp(4,\mathbb{Z}) to identify some finite order elements and do explicit computations using the presentation to verify their orders.
