For a finitely generated group G the Nielsen graph N_n(G), n\geq \operatorname{rank}(G), describes the action of the group \operatorname{Aut}F_n of automorphisms of the free group F_n on generating n-tuples of G by elementary Nielsen moves. The question of (non)amenability of Nielsen graphs is of particular interest in relation with the open question about Property (T) for \operatorname{Aut}F_n, n\geq 4. We prove nonamenability of Nielsen graphs N_n(G) for all n\ge \max\{2,\operatorname{rank}(G)\} when G is indicable, and for n big enough when G is elementary amenable. We give an explicit description of N_d(G) for relatively free (in some variety) groups of rank d and discuss their connectedness and nonamenability. Examples considered include free polynilpotent groups and free Burnside groups.
