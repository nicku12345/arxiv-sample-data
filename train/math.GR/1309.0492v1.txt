We show that the abstract commensurator of an S-arithmetic subgroup of a solvable algebraic group over Q is isomorphic to the Q-points of an algebraic group, and compare this with examples of nonlinear abstract commensurators of S-arithmetic groups in positive characteristic. In particular, we include a description of the abstract commensurator of the lamplighter group.
