Let f be an automorphism of a group G. Two elements x, y in G are said to be in the same f-twisted conjugacy class if there exists an element z in G such that y=z x f(z^{-1}). This is an equivalence relation known as f-twisted conjugacy. If the number R(f) of f-twisted conjugacy classes is infinite for every automorphism f of G one says that G has the R_\infty-property. We show that the Richard Thompson group T has the R_\infty-property.
