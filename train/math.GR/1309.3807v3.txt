Let G be a connected reductive algebraic group defined over an algebraically closed field k. The aim of this paper is to present a method to find triples (G,M,H) with the following three properties. Property 1: G is simple and k has characteristic 2. Property 2: H and M are closed reductive subgroups of G such that H<M<G, and (G,M) is a reductive pair. Property 3: H is G-completely reducible, but not M-completely reducible. We exhibit our method by presenting a new example of such a triple in G=E_7. Then we consider a rationality problem and a problem concerning conjugacy classes as important applications of our construction.
