We investigate the rectifiable spaces, the Mal'cev algebras, the almost quasivarieties of topological algebraic systems and their free systems and others. It specifies and corrects the roughest mistakes, incorrect statements and nonsense of the introduced concepts connected with the concepts listed before, which are available in numerous papers on topological algebraic systems, basically in papers of Academician Choban M.M. and his disciples.
