We use the description of the Schutzenberger automata for amalgams of finite inverse semigroups given by Cherubini, Meakin, Piochi to obtain structural results for such amalgams. Schutzenberger automata, in the case of amalgams of finite inverse semigroups, are automata with special structure possessing finite subgraphs, that contain all essential information related to the whole automaton. Using this crucial fact, and the Bass-Serre theory, we show that the maximal subgroups of an amalgamated free-product are either isomorphic to certain subgroups of the original semigroups or can be described as fundamental groups of particular finite graphs of groups build from the maximal subgroups of the original semigroups.
