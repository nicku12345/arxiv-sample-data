Uniformly finite homology is a coarse invariant for metric spaces; in particular, it is a quasi-isometry invariant for finitely generated groups. In this article, we study uniformly finite homology of finitely generated amenable groups and prove that it is infinite dimensional in many cases. The main idea is to use different transfer maps to distinguish between classes in uniformly finite homology. Furthermore we show that there are infinitely many classes in degree zero that cannot be detected by means.
