We consider (projectively) linearly sofic groups, i.e. groups which can be approximated using (projective) matrices over arbitrary fields, as a generalization of sofic groups. We generalize known results for sofic groups and groups which can be approximated with complex matrices, including the fact that free products of linearly sofic groups (using a fixed field) are linearly sofic.
