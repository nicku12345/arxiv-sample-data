We consider generalisations of Thompson's group V, denoted V_r(\Sigma), which also include the groups of Higman, Stein and Brin. We show that, under some mild hypotheses, V_r(\Sigma) is the full automorphism group of a Cantor-algebra. Under some further minor restrictions, we prove that these groups are of type \mathrm{F}_\infty and that this implies that also centralisers of finite subgroups are of type \mathrm{F}_\infty.
