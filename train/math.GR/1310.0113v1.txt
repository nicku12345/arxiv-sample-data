The groups of order 64p without a normal sylow p-subgroup are listed, and their automorphism groups are also determined. As a by-product of our original effort to get these groups, we needed to determine the automorphism groups of those groups of order 64 with an odd-order automorphism. In view of the fact that we already had determined these groups and that these automorphism groups are not given explicitly in the literature, we have appended to this report these automorphism groups. In another project we were looking for new complete groups by following automorphism group towers up to completion when the computer memory allowed such followups. We did this for these groups of order 64. In another appendix we give the results of this work as applied to the groups of order 64.
