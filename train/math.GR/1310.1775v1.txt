For a finite non cyclic group G, let \gamma(G) be the smallest integer k such that G contains k proper subgroups H_1,\dots,H_k with the property that every element of G is contained in H_i^g for some i \in \{1,\dots,k\} and g \in G. We prove that if G is a noncyclic permutation group of degree n, then \gamma(G)\leq (n+2)/2. We then investigate the structure of the groups G with \gamma(G)=\sigma(G) (where \sigma(G) is the size of a minimal cover of G) and of those with \gamma(G)=2.
