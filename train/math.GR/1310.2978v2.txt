Let q be a prime power and let G be an absolutely irreducible subgroup of GL_d(F), where F is a finite field of the same characteristic as \F_q, the field of q elements. Assume that G \cong G(q), a quasisimple group of exceptional Lie type over \F_q which is neither a Suzuki nor a Ree group. We present a Las Vegas algorithm that constructs an isomorphism from G to the standard copy of G(q). If G \not\cong {}^3 D_4(q) with q even, then the algorithm runs in polynomial time, subject to the existence of a discrete log oracle.
