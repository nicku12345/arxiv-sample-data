We describe inertial endomorphisms of an abelian group A, that is endomorphisms \varphi with the property |(\varphi(X)+X)/X|<\infty for each X\le A. They form a ring containing multiplications, the so-called finitary endomorphisms and non-trivial instances.   We show that inertial invertible endomorphisms form a group, provided A has finite torsion-free rank. In any case, the group IAut(A) they generate is commutative modulo the group FAut(A) of finitary automorphisms, which is known to be locally finite.   We deduce that IAut(A) is locally-(center-by-finite).   Also we consider the lattice dual property, that is that |X/(X\cap \varphi(X))|<\infty for each X\le A. We show that this implies the above one, provided A has finite torsion-free rank.
