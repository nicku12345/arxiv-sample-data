Here we give a complete group classification of the general case of linear systems of three second-order ordinary differential equations excluding the case of systems which are studied in the literature. This is given as the initial step in the study of nonlinear systems of three second-order ordinary differential equations. In addition the complete group classification of a system of three linear second-order ordinary differential equations is done. Four cases of linear systems of equations are obtained.
