Let V be a finite vector space over a finite field of order q and of characteristic p. Let G\leq GL(V) be a p-solvable completely reducible linear group. Then there exists a base for G on V of size at most 2 unless q \leq 4 in which case there exists a base of size at most 3. The first statement extends a recent result of Halasi and Podoski and the second statement generalizes a theorem of Seress. An extension of a theorem of P\'alfy and Wolf is also given.
