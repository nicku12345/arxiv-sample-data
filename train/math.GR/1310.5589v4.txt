A new flavour of amenability for discrete semigroups is proposed that generalises group amenability and follows from a \Folner-type condition. Some examples are explored, to argue that this new notion better captures some essential ideas of amenability. A semigroup S is left fairly amenable if, and only if, it supports a mean m\in\ell^\infty(S)^* satisfying m(f) = m(s\ast f) whenever s\ast f\in\ell^\infty(S), thus justifying the nomenclature "fairly amenable''.
