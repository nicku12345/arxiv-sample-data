In 2001 Ivanov and Kerov associated with the infinite permutation group S_\infty certain commutative associative algebra A_\infty called the algebra of conjugacy classes of partial elements. A standard basis of A_\infty is labeled by Yang diagrams of all orders.   Mironov, Morozov, Natanzon, 2012, have proved that the completion of A_\infty is isomorphic to the direct product of centers of group algebras of groups S_n. This isomorphism was explored in a construction of infinite dimensional Cardy-Frobenius algebra corresponding to asymptotic Hurwitz numbers.   In this work algebras of conjugacy classes of partial elements are defined for a wider class of infinite groups. It is proven that completion of any such algebra is isomorphic to the direct product of centers of group algebras of relevant subgroups.
