The Baer--Suzuki theorem says that if p is a prime, x is a p-element in a finite group G and \langle x, x^g \rangle is a p-group for all g \in G, then the normal closure of x in G is a p-group. We consider the case where x^g is replaced by y^g for some other p-element y. While the analog of Baer--Suzuki is not true, we show that some variation is. We also answer a closely related question of Pavel Shumyatsky on commutators of conjugacy classes of p-elements.
