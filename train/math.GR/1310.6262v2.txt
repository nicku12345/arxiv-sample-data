We study cohomological finiteness conditions for groups associated to Mackey and cohomological Mackey functors, proving that the cohomological dimension associated to cohomological Mackey functors is always equal to the \mathcal{F}-cohomological dimension, and characterising the conditions Mackey-\mathrm{FP}_n and cohomological Mackey-\mathrm{FP}_n. We show that all finiteness conditions for cohomological Mackey functors are unchanged when considering only the family of p-subgroups, and we characterise cohomological Mackey-\mathrm{FP}_n conditions over the finite field \mathbb{F}_p.
