Let H be an extension of a finite group Q by a finite group G. Inspired by the results of duality theorems for \'etale gerbes on orbifolds, we describe the number of conjugacy classes of H that maps to the same conjugacy class of Q. Furthermore, we prove a generalization of the orthogonality relation between characters of G.
