Let \mathcal C be a set of finite groups which is closed under taking subgroups and let d and M be positive integers. Suppose that for any G\in\mathcal C whose order is divisible by at most two distinct primes there exists an abelian subgroup A\subseteq G such that A is generated by at most d elements and [G : A] \le M. We prove that there exists a positive constant C_0 such that any G \in \mathcal C has an abelian subgroup A satisfying [G : A] \le C_0, and A can be generated by at most d elements. We also prove some related results. Our proofs use the Classification of Finite Simple Groups.
