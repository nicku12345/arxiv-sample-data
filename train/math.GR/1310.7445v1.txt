In this paper we consider the Fitting subgroup F(G) of a finite group G and its generalizations: the quasinilpotent radical F^*(G) and the generalized Fitting subgroup \tilde{F}(G) defined by \tilde{F}(G)\supseteq \Phi(G) and \tilde{F}(G)/\Phi(G)=Soc(G/\Phi(G)). We sum up known properties of \tilde{F}(G) and suggest some new ones. Let R be a subgroup of a group G. We shall call a subgroup H of G the R-subnormal subgroup if H is subnormal in  \langle H,R\rangle. In this work the influence of R-subnormal subgroups (maximal, Sylow, cyclic primary) on the structure of finite groups are studied in the case when R\in\{F(G), F^*(G),\tilde{F}(G)\}.
