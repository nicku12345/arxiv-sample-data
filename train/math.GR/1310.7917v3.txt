Real forms of a complex reductive group are classified in terms of Galois cohomology H^1(\Gamma,G_{ad}) where G_{ad} is the adjoint group. Alternatively, the theory of the Cartan involution gives a description in terms of cohomology with respect to a holomorphic involution: H^1(\mathbb Z/2\mathbb Z,G_{ad}) where the non trivial element acts by a holomorphic involution \theta.   The main theorem is that in general, if \theta is the Cartan involution of a real form \sigma, there is a canonical isomorphism H^1(\Gamma,G)\simeq H^1(\mathbb Z/2\mathbb Z,G).   This has applications to the structure and representation theory of real groups. We give two such applications. The first is a simple proof of Matsuki's result on conjugacy classes of tori in real groups. The second is a computation of H^1(\Gamma,G) in general. The answer is expressed in terms of the notion of strong real forms. We include tables for all simply connected simple groups.
