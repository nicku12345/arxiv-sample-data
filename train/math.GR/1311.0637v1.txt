For an arbitrary sequence (G_s) of subgroups of finite index in the generalised Thompson group F_{n, \infty} = \langle x_0, x_1, \ldots, x_m, \ldots \mid x_i^{x_j} = x_{i+ n-1} \hbox{ for } i > j \geq 0 \rangle it is shown that \sup_{s \geq 1} d(G_s) < \infty and that the deficiency gradient of F_{n, \infty} with respect to (G_s) is 0 provided [G : G_s] tends to infinity. A higher dimensional analogue is considered for n = 2.
