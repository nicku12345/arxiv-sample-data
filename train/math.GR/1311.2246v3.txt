We study the first cohomology groups of a countable discrete group G with coefficients in a G-module \ell^\Phi(G), where \Phi is an N-function of class \Delta_2(0)\cap \nabla_2(0). In development of ideas of Puls and Martin--Valette, for a finitely generated group G, we introduce the discrete \Phi-Laplacian and prove a theorem on the decomposition of the space of \Phi-Dirichlet finite functions into the direct sum of the spaces of \Phi-harmonic functions and \ell^\Phi(G) (with an appropriate factorization). We also prove that if a finitely generated group G has a finitely generated infinite amenable subgroup with infinite centralizer then \overline{H}^{1}(G,\ell^{\Phi}(G)) = 0. In conclusion, we show the triviality of the first cohomology group for a wreath product of two groups one of which is nonamenable.
