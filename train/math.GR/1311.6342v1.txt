The commuting graph of a non-abelian group is a simple graph in which the vertices are the non-central elements of the group, and two distinct vertices are adjacent if and only if they commute. In this paper, we classify (up to isomorphism) all finite non-abelian groups whose commuting graphs are acyclic, planar or toroidal. We also derive explicit formulas for the genus of the commuting graphs of some well-known class of finite non-abelian groups, and show that, every collection of finite non-abelian groups whose commuting graphs have the same genus is finite.
