Handel and Mosher define the axis bundle for a fully irreducible outer automorphism in "Axes in Outer Space." In this paper we give a necessary and sufficient condition for the axis bundle to consist of a unique periodic fold line. As a consequence, we give a setting, and means for identifying in this setting, when two elements of an outer automorphism group Out(F_r) have conjugate powers.
