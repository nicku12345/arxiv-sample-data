First let G be a completely solvable Lie group. We recall the proof of the following result: Any closed subgroup of G possesses a unique syndetic hull in G. As a consequence we conclude that any uniform subgroup \Gamma of G is strongly rigid in the sense of G. D. Mostow: If \alpha:\Gamma\to G is a homomorphism of Lie groups such that \alpha(\Gamma) is uniform in G, then there is an automorphism \varphi of G such that \varphi\,|\,\Gamma=\alpha. Now let G be an arbitrary (exponential) solvable Lie group. We discuss certain conditions on closed subgroups of G which are sufficient for the existence of a syndetic hull.
