Let \ell be a prime different from p. Let B be an \ell-block of the subgroup of rational points G^F. Under mild restrictions on \ell, we show the existence of an algebraic reductive group H defined over {\Bbb F}_q {\it via} a Frobenius F, and of a unipotent \ell-block b of H^F such that : the respective defect groups of b and B are isomorphic, the associated Brauer categories are isomorphic and there is a height preserving one-to-one map from the set of irreducible representations of b onto the set of irreducible representations of B. \end
