The subgroup commutativity degree of a group G has been defined in [6] as the probability that two subgroups of G commute, or equivalently that the product of two subgroups is again a subgroup. Problem 4.3 of [6] asks whether there exist families of groups other than dihedral, quasi-dihedral or generalized quaternion (all of 2-power cardinality), whose subgroup commutativity degree tends to 0 as the size of the group tends to infinity. An affirmative answer to this question has been provided by Aivazidis [1, 2] for the family of projective special linear groups over fields of even characteristic and for the family of the simple Suzuki groups. In this short note we indicate another family of groups with this property, namely the finite P-groups.
