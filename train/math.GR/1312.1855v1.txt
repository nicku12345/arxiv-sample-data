Lehnert and Schweitzer show in [20] that R. Thompson's group V is a co-context-free (co\mathcal{CF}) group, thus implying that all of its finitely generated subgroups are also co\mathcal{CF} groups. Also, Lehnert shows in his thesis that V embeds inside the co\mathcal{CF} group \mathrm{QAut}(\mathcal{T}_{2,c}), which is a group of particular bijections on the vertices of an infinite binary 2-edge-colored tree, and he conjectures that \mathrm{QAut}(\mathcal{T}_{2,c}) is a universal co\mathcal{CF} group. We show that \mathrm{QAut}(\mathcal{T}_{2,c}) embeds into V, and thus obtain a new form for Lehnert's conjecture. Following up on these ideas, we begin work to build a representation theory into R. Thompson's group V. In particular we classify precisely which Baumslag-Solitar groups embed into V.
