We investigate Moufang loops which can be written as the semidirect product of a loop and a group. We also examine a particular class of loop extensions which arise as a result of a finite cyclic group acting as a group of semiautomorphisms on an inverse property loop. A question posed by Gagola III related to such extensions is partially answered, and we give several examples which illustrate that, in general, these extensions are not well-behaved.
