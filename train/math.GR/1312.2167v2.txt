If \phi is an automorphism of a group G and x,y\in G, we say that x and y are \phi-twisted conjugates if there exists an z\in G such that y=z.x.\phi(z^{-1}). This is an equivalence relation. If there are infinitely many \phi-twisted conjugacy classes for every automorphism \phi of G we say that G has the R_\infty-property. We prove that the generalized Richard Thompson groups F_n and F(l,A,P) have the R_\infty-property.
