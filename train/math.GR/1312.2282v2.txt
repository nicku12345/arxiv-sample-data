We prove that Claas R\"over's Thompson-Grigorchuk simple group V\mathcal{G} has type F_\infty. The proof involves constructing two complexes on which V\mathcal{G} acts: a simplicial complex analogous to the Stein complex for V, and a polysimiplical complex analogous to the Farley complex for V. We then analyze the descending links of the polysimplicial complex, using a theorem of Belk and Forrest to prove increasing connectivity.
