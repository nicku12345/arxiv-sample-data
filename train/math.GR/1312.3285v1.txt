This paper is a natural continuation of paper "On rectifiable spaces and its algebraical equivalents, topological algebraic systems and Mal'cev algebras" published in arxiv:1309.4572. Thus we justify the need to present the entire material in an unified manner. This paper is the continuation of Section 6 from the first paper. It specifies and corrects the roughest mistakes, incorrect statements and nonsense of the introduced concepts, which are available in numerous papers on topological algebraic systems, basically in papers of Academician Choban M. M. and his disciples.
