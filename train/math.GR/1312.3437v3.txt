For a Coxeter system (W,S) let a_n^{(W,S)} be the cardinality of the sphere of radius n in the Cayley graph of W with respect to the standard generating set S. It is shown that, if (W,S)\preceq(W',S') then a_n^{(W,S)}\leq a_n^{(W',S')} for all n\in \mathbb{N}_0, where \preceq is a suitable partial order on Coxeter systems (cf. Thm. A).   It is proven that there exists a constant \tau= 1.13\dots such that for any non-affine, non-spherical Coxeter system (W,S) the growth rate \omega(W,S)=\limsup \sqrt[n]{a_n} satisfies \omega(W,S)\geq \tau (cf. Thm. B). The constant \tau is a Perron number of degree 127 over \mathbb{Q}.   For a Coxeter group W the Coxeter generating set is not unique (up to W-conjugacy), but there is a standard procedure, the diagram twisting (cf. [BMMN02]), which allows one to pass from one Coxeter generating set S to another Coxeter generating set \mu(S). A generalisation of the diagram twisting is introduced, the mutation, and it is proven that Poincar\'e series are invariant under mutations (cf. Thm. C).
