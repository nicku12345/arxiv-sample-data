We introduce and study local combinatorial conditions on a simplicial complex, implying Gromov hyperbolicity of its universal cover. We apply the theory to Thurston's problem on 5/6*-triangulations of 3-manifolds, providing a new proof and generalizing the original result. We indicate further applications.
