For group presentations with cyclic symmetry, there is a connection between asphericity and the dynamics of the shift automorphism. For the class of groups G_n(k,l) described by the cyclic presentations \mathcal{P}_n(k,l) = (x_i:x_ix_{i+k}x_{i+l}\ (i \mod n)) and studied extensively by G. Williams and M. Edjvet \cite{EdjvetWilliams}, the shift acts freely on the nonidentity elements of G_n(k,l) if and only if the presentation \mathcal{P}_n(k,l) is combinatorially aspherical in the sense of \cite{CCH}. The shift has a nonidentity fixed point precisely when G_n(k,l) is finite.
