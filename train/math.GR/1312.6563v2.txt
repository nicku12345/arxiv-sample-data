This paper presents a study of generic elements in full isometry groups of Polish ultrametric spaces. We obtain a complete characterization of Polish ultrametric spaces X whose isometry group Iso(X) contains an open subgroup H with ample generics. It also gives a characterization of the existence of an open subgroup in Iso(X) with a comeager conjugacy class.   We also study the transfinite sequence defined by the projection of a Polish ultrametric space X on the ultrametric space of orbits of X under the action of Iso(X).
