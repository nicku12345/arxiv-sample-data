This article resolves several long-standing conjectures about Artin groups of euclidean type. In particular, we prove that every irreducible euclidean Artin group is a torsion-free centerless group with a decidable word problem and a finite-dimensional classifying space. We do this by showing that each of these groups is isomorphic to a subgroup of a group with an infinite-type Garside structure. The Garside groups involved are introduced here for the first time. They are constructed by applying semi-standard procedures to crystallographic groups that contain euclidean Coxeter groups but which need not be generated by the reflections they contain.
