Let G=QD_{8k}~ be the quasi-dihedral group of order 8n and \theta be an automorphism of QD_{8k} of finite order. The fixed-point set H of \theta is defined as H_{\theta}=G^{\theta}=\{x\in G \mid \theta(x)=x\} and generalized symmetric space Q of \theta given by Q_{\theta}=\{g\in G \mid g=x\theta(x)^{-1}~\mbox{for some}~x\in G\}.   The characteristics of the sets H and Q have been calculated. It is shown that for any H and Q,~~H.Q\neq QD_{8k}. the H-orbits on Q are obtained under different conditions. Moreover, the formula to find the order of v-th root of unity in \mathbb{Z}_{2k} for QD_{8k} has been calculated. The criteria to find the number of equivalence classes denoted by C_{4k} of the involution automorphism has also been constructed. Finally, the set of twisted involutions R=R_{\theta}=\{~x\in G~\mid~\theta(x)=x^{-1}\} has been explored.
