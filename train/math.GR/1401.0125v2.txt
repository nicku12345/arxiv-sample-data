We define the structure of spaces with labelled partitions which generalizes the structure of spaces with measured walls and study the link between actions by automorphisms on spaces with labelled partitions and isometric affine actions on Banach spaces, and more particularly, on L^p spaces. We build natural spaces with labelled partitions for the action of various contructions of groups, namely: direct sum; semi-direct product; wreath product and amalgamated free product. We apply this to prove that the wreath product of a group with property PL^p by a group with Haagerup property has property PL^p and the amalgamated free product over finite subgroups of groups with property PL^p has property PL^p.
