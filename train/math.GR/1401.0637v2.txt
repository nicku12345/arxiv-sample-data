In this paper we exhibit a type of semigroup presentations which determines a class of local groups. We show that the finite elements of this class generate the pseudovariety {\bf LG} of all finite local groups and use them as test-semigroups to prove that {\bf LG} and {\bf S}, the pseudovariety of all finite semigroups, verify the same \kappa-identities involving \kappa-terms of rank at most 1, where \kappa denotes the implicit signature consisting of the multiplication and the (\omega-1)-power.
