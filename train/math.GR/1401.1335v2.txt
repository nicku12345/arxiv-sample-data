Let \mathfrak{F} be a formation and G a finite group. A subgroup H of G is said to be weakly \mathfrak{F}_{s}-quasinormal in G if G has an S-quasinormal subgroup T such that HT is S-quasinormal in G and (H\cap T)H_{G}/H_{G}\leq Z_{\mathfrak{F}}(G/H_{G}), where Z_{\mathfrak{F}}(G/H_{G}) denotes the \mathfrak{F}-hypercenter of G/H_{G}. In this paper, we study the structure of finite groups by using the concept of weakly \mathfrak{F}_{s}-quasinormal subgroups.
