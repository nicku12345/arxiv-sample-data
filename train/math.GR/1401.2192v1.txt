A crucial lemma on module theory is Nakayama's lemma \cite{AF}. In this article, we shall investigate some forms of Nakayama's lemma in the category of right acts over a given monoid S with identity 1. More precisely, among other things, we show that equality AI=A for some proper ideal I of S implies A=\{\theta\}, when A is a finitely generated quasi-strongly faithful S-act with unique zero element \theta and S is a monoid in which its unique maximal right ideal \mathfrak{M} is two-sided. Furthermore, as an application of Nakayama's lemma we prove Krull intersection theorem for S-acts. Finally, as a consequence, we shall see a homological classification form of this lemma, i.e, we prove if S is a commutative monoid then every projective S-act is free if and only if E(S)=\{1\}, which E(S) is the set of all idempotents of S.
