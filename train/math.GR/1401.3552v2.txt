The class A of anabelian groups is defined as the collection of finite groups without abelian composition factors. We prove that the commutator word [x_1,x_2] and the power word x_1^p have bounded width in A when p is an odd integer. By contrast the word x^{30} does not have bounded width in A. On the other hand any given word w has bounded width for those groups in A whose composition factors are sufficiently large as a function of w. In the course of the proof we establish that sufficiently large almost simple groups cannot satisfy w as a coset identity.
