We establish the connection between Green's {\mathcal J}-classes and the subduction equivalence classes defined on the image sets of an action of a semigroup. The construction of the skeleton order (on subduction equivalence classes) is shown to depend in a functorial way on transformation semigroups and surjective morphisms, and to factor through the \leq_{\mathcal L}-order and \leq_{\mathcal J}-order on the semigroup and through the inclusion order on image sets. For right regular representations, the correspondence between the {\mathcal J}-class order and the skeleton is one of isomorphism.
