Given a finitely generated subgroup G of a ring R we provide a finite subset of G such that if each element of this set satisfies some cubic polynomial equation in one variable over the center Z of R then the subring generated by G has finite Z-rank. We specialize our considerations to the case where the polynomial equations are equal to (x-1)^3=0.
