The aim of this small note is to prove an elementary yet useful properties of finitely presented groups. Let G be a finitely generated group with one end. Fix a (finite) generating set and let B_n be the ball of radius n around e. Let B_n^{c,\infty} be the infinite connected component of the complement of B_n. Then G has connected spheres if there exists a r >0 such that B_{n+r} \cap B_n^{c,\infty} is connected for all n \geq 0. This note shows that if G is finitely presented then it has connected spheres.
