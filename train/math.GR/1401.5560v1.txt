Let \frak{F} be a class of finite groups. A subgroup H of a finite group G is said to be \mathfrak{F_{\mathrm s}}-quasinormal in G if there exists a normal subgroup T of G such that HT is s-permutable in G and (H\cap T)H_G/H_G is contained in the \frak{F}-hypercenter Z_\infty^\mathfrak{F}(G/H_G) of G/H_G. In this paper, we investigate further the influence of \mathfrak{F_{\mathrm s}}-quasinormality of some subgroups on the structure of finite groups. New characterization of some classes of finite groups are obtained.
