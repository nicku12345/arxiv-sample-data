In this paper we study the asymptotic probability that a random system of equations in free abelian group \mathbb{Z}^m of rank m is solvable. Denote SAT(\mathbb{Z}^m, k, n) and SAT_{\mathbb{Q}^m}(\mathbb{Z}^m, k, n) the sets of all systems of n equations in k variables in the group \mathbb{Z}^m solvable in \mathbb{Z}^m and \mathbb{Q}^m respectively. We show that asymptotic density of the set SAT_{\mathbb{Q}^m}(\mathbb{Z}^m, k, n) is equal to 1 for n \leq k, and is equal to 0 for n > k. For n < k we give nontrivial estimates for upper and lower asymptotic densities of the set SAT(\mathbb{Z}^m, k, n). When n > k the set SAT(\mathbb{Z}^m, k, n) is negligible. Also for n \leq k we provide some connection between asymptotic density of the set SAT(\mathbb{Z}^m, k, n) and sums over full rank matrices involving their greatest divisors.
