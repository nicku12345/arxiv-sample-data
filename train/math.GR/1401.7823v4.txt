In this paper, we consider the group Aut(\mathbb{Q}, \leq) of order-automorphisms of the rational numbers, proving a result analogous to a theorem of Galvin's for the symmetric group. In an announcement, Kh\'elif states that every countable subset of Aut(\mathbb{Q}, \leq) is contained in an N-generated subgroup of Aut(\mathbb{Q}, \leq) for some fixed N\in\mathbb{N}. We show that the least such N is 2. Moreover, for every countable subset of Aut(\mathbb{Q}, \leq), we show that every element can be given as a prescribed product of two generators without using their inverses. More precisely, suppose that a and b freely generate the free semigroup \{a,b\}^+ consisting of the non-empty words over a and b. Then we show that there exists a sequence of words w_1, w_2,\ldots over \{a,b\} such that for every sequence f_1, f_2, \ldots\in\,Aut(\mathbb{Q}, \leq) there is a homomorphism \phi:\{a,b\}^{+}\to Aut(\mathbb{Q},\leq) where (w_i)\phi=f_i for every i.   As a corollary to the main theorem in this paper, we obtain a result of Droste and Holland showing that the strong cofinality of Aut(\mathbb{Q}, \leq) is uncountable, or equivalently that Aut(\mathbb{Q}, \leq) has uncountable cofinality and Bergman's property.
