It is an open question whether right-angled Coxeter groups have unique group-equivariant visual boundaries. Croke and Kleiner present a right-angled Artin group with more than one visual boundary. In this paper we present a right-angled Coxeter group with non-unique equivariant visual boundary. The main theorem is that if right-angled Coxeter groups act geometrically on a Croke-Kleiner spaces, then the local angles in those spaces all have to be right angles. We present a specific right-angled Coxeter group with non-unique equivariant visual boundary. However, we conjecture that the right an- gled Coxeter groups that can act geometrically on a given CAT(0) space are far from unique.
