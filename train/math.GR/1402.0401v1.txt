We discuss in the context of finite extensions two classical theorems of Takahasi and Howson on subgroups of free groups. We provide bounds for the rank of the intersection of subgroups within classes of groups such as virtually free groups, virtually nilpotent groups or fundamental groups of finite graphs of groups with virtually polycyclic vertex groups and finite edge groups. As an application of our generalization of Takahasi's Theorem, we provide an uniform bound for the rank of the periodic subgroup of any endomorphism of the fundamental group of a given finite graph of groups with finitely generated virtually nilpotent vertex groups and finite edge groups.
