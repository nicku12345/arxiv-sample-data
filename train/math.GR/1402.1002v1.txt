In this note, we define a new graph \Gamma_d(G) on a finite group G, where d is a divisor of |G|. The vertices of \Gamma_d(G) are the subgroups of G of order d and two subgroups H_1 and H_2 of G are said to be adjacent if there exists S_i \in \mathcal{T}(G,H_i) (i=1,2) such that S_1 \cong S_2. We shall discuss the completeness of \Gamma_d(G) for various groups like finite abelian groups, dihedral groups and some finite p-groups.
