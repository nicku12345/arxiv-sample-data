It is well known there is no finitely generated abelian group which has the R_\infty property. We will show that also many non-finitely generated abelian groups do not have the R_\infty property, but this does not hold for all of them. In fact we construct an uncountable number of infinite countable abelian groups which do have the R_{\infty} property. We also construct an abelian group such that the cardinality of the Reidemeister classes is uncountable for any automorphism of that group. 8 pages, no figures
