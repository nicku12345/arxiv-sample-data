We show that the wreath product G \wr \mathbb{Z}^n of any finitely generated group G with \mathbb{Z}^n has finite palindromic width. We also show that C \wr A has finite palindromic width if C has finite commutator width and A is a finitely generated infinite abelian group. Further we prove that if H is a non-abelian group with finite palindromic width and G any finitely generated group, then every element of the subgroup G' \wr H can be expressed as a product of uniformly boundedly many palindromes. From this we obtain that P \wr H has finite palindromic width if P is a perfect group and further that G \wr F has finite palindromic width for any finite, non-abelian group F.
