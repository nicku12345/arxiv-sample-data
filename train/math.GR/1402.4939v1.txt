A semigroup S is called a permutable semigroup if \alpha \circ \beta =\beta \circ \alpha is satified for all congruences \alpha and \beta of S. A semigroup is called a Putcha semigroup if it is a semilattice of archimedean semigroups. In this paper we deal with finite permutable Putcha semigroups. We describe the finite permutable archimedean semigroups and finite permutable semigroups which are semilattices of a group and a nilpotent semigroup.
