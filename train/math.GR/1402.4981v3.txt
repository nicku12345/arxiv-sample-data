When (S,\mathcal{F},\mathcal{L}) is a p-local finite group and (T,\mathcal{E},\mathcal{\L}_0) is weakly normal in (S,\mathcal{F},\mathcal{L}) we show that a definition of C_S(\mathcal{E}) given by Aschbacher has a simple interpretation from which one can deduce existence and strong closure very easily. We also appeal to a result of Gross to give a new proof that there is a unique fusion system C_{\mathcal{F}}(\mathcal{E}) on C_S(\mathcal{E}).
