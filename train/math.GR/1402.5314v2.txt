In arXiv:1303.1129, the authors provided a bound for the palindromic width of free abelian-by-nilpotent group AN_n of rank n and free nilpotent group {\rm N}_{n,r} of rank n and step r. In the present paper we study palindromic widths of groups \widetilde{AN}_n and \widetilde{\rm N}_{n,r}. We denote by \widetilde{G}_n = G_n / \langle \langle x_1^2, \ldots, x_n^2 \rangle \rangle the quotient of group G_n = \langle x_1, \ldots, x_n \rangle, which is free in some variety by the normal subgroup generated by x_1^2, \ldots, x_n^2. We prove that the palindromic width of the quotient \widetilde{AN}_n is finite and bounded by 3n. We also prove that the palindromic width of the quotient \widetilde{\rm N}_{n, 2} is precisely 2(n-1). We improve the lower bound of the palindromic width for {\rm N}_{n, r}. We prove that the palindromic width of {\rm N}_{n, r}, r\geq 2 is at least 2(n-1). We also improve the bound for palindromic widths of free metabelian groups. We prove that the palindromic width of free metabelian group of rank n is at most 4n-1.
