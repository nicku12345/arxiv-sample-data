We classify up to conjugation by \operatorname{GL}(2,\mathbb{R}) (more precisely, block diagonal symplectic matrices) all the semidirect products inside the maximal parabolic of \operatorname{Sp}(2,\mathbb{R}) by means of an essentially geometric argument. This classification has already been established without geometry, under a stricter notion of equivalence, namely conjugation by arbitrary symplectic matrices. The present approach might be useful in higher dimensions and provides some insight.
