Let \Delta\colon G \to \mathrm{GL}(n, K) be an absolutely irreducible representation of an arbitrary group G over an arbitrary field K; let \chi\colon G \to K\colon g \mapsto \mathrm{tr}(\Delta(g)) be its character. In this paper, we assume knowledge of \chi only, and study which properties of \Delta can be inferred. We prove criteria to decide whether \Delta preserves a form, is realizable over a subfield, or acts imprimitively on K^{n \times 1}. If K is finite, this allows us to decide whether the image of \Delta belongs to certain Aschbacher classes.
