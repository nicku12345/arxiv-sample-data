Suppose that G is a finite group such that \operatorname{SL}(n,q)\subseteq G \subseteq \operatorname{GL}(n,q), and that Z is a central subgroup of G. Let T(G/Z) be the abelian group of equivalence classes of endotrivial k(G/Z)-modules, where k is an algebraically closed field of characteristic~p not dividing q. We show that the torsion free rank of T(G/Z) is at most one, and we determine T(G/Z) in the case that the Sylow p-subgroup of G is abelian and nontrivial. The proofs for the torsion subgroup of T(G/Z) use the theory of Young modules for \operatorname{GL}(n,q) and a new method due to Balmer for computing the kernel of restrictions in the group of endotrivial modules.
