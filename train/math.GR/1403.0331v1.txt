We will determine all infinite 2-locally finite groups as well as infinite 2-groups with planar subgroup graph and show that infinite groups satisfying the chain conditions containing an involution do not have planar embeddings. Also, all connected outer-planar groups and outer-planar groups satisfying the chain conditions are presented. As a result, all planar groups which are direct product of connected groups are obtained.
