This paper pursues an investigation on groups equipped with an L-ordered relation, where L is a fixed complete complete Heyting algebra. First, by the concept of join and meet on an L-ordered set, the notion of an L-lattice is introduced and some related results are obtained. Then we applied them to define an L-lattice ordered group. We also introduce convex L-subgroups to construct a quotient L-ordered group. At last, a relation between the positive cone of an L-ordered group and special type of elements of L^G is found, where G is a group.
