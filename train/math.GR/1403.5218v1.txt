A groupoid that satisfies the left invertive law: ab\cdot c=cb\cdot a is called an AG-groupoid. We extend the concept of left abelian distributive groupoid (LAD) and right abelian distributive groupoid (RAD) to introduce new subclasses of AG-groupoid, left abelian distributive AG-groupoid and right abelian distributive AG-groupoid. We give their enumeration up to order 6 and find some basic relations of these new classes with other known subclasses of AG-groupoids and other relevant algebraic structures. We establish a method to test an arbitrary AG-groupoid for these classes.
