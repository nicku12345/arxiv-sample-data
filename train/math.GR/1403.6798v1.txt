We prove that if the order of a splitting automorphism of free Burnside group~B(m,n) of odd period~n\ge1003 is a prime power, then the automorphism is inner. Thus, we give an affirmative answer to the question on the coincidence of splitting and inner automorphisms of free Burnside groups B(m,n) for automorphisms of orders~p^k (p is a prime number). This question was posed in the Kourovka Notebook in 1990 (see 11th ed., Question 11.36.~b).
