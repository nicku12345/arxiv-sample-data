Let G be a finite primitive permutation group and let \kappa(G) be the number of conjugacy classes of derangements in G. By a classical theorem of Jordan, \kappa(G) \geqslant 1. In this paper we classify the groups G with \kappa(G)=1, and we use this to obtain new results on the structure of finite groups with an irreducible complex character that vanishes on a unique conjugacy class. We also obtain detailed structural information on the groups with \kappa(G)=2, including a complete classification for almost simple groups.
