Given a Mersenne prime q and a positive even integer e, let F and E be the fields of orders q and q^e respectively. Let C be a cyclic subgroup of E^\times whose index in E^\times is divisible only by primes dividing q - 1. We compute the character degrees of the group C \rtimes {\rm Gal} (E/F) by using the Galois connection between the subfields of E and the Galois group {\rm Gal} (E/F).
