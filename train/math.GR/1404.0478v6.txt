We examine varieties of epigroups as unary semigroups, that is semigroups equipped with an additional unary operation of pseudoinversion. The article contains two main results. The first of them indicates a countably infinite family of injective endomorphisms of the lattice of all epigroup varieties. An epigroup variety is said to be a variety of finite degree if all its nilsemigroups are nilpotent. The second result of the article provides a characterization of epigroup varieties of finite degree in a language of identities and in terms of minimal forbidden subvarieties. Note that the first result is essentially used in the proof of the second one.
