In this paper we give some conditions in which a direct product of groups is \mathcal{V}-capable if and only if each of its factors is \mathcal{V}-capable for some varieties \mathcal{V}. Moreover, we give some conditions in which a direct product of a finite family of pairs of groups is capable if and only if each of its factors is a capable pair of groups.
