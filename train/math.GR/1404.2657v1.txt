Let \mathcal P_X and \mathcal S_X be the partition monoid and symmetric group on an infinite set X. We show that \mathcal P_X may be generated by \mathcal S_X together with two (but no fewer) additional partitions, and we classify the pairs \alpha,\beta\in\mathcal P_X for which \mathcal P_X is generated by \mathcal S_X\cup\{\alpha,\beta\}. We also show that \mathcal P_X may be generated by the set \mathcal E_X of all idempotent partitions together with two (but no fewer) additional partitions. In fact, \mathcal P_X is generated by \mathcal E_X\cup\{\alpha,\beta\} if and only if it is generated by \mathcal E_X\cup\mathcal S_X\cup\{\alpha,\beta\}. We also classify the pairs \alpha,\beta\in\mathcal P_X for which \mathcal P_X is generated by \mathcal E_X\cup\{\alpha,\beta\}. Among other results, we show that any countable subset of \mathcal P_X is contained in a 4-generated subsemigroup of \mathcal P_X, and that the length function on \mathcal P_X is bounded with respect to any generating set.
