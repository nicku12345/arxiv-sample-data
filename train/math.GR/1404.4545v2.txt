Recently, shearlet groups have received much attention in connection with shearlet transforms applied for orientation sensitive image analysis and restoration. The square integrable representations of the shearlet groups provide not only the basis for the shearlet transforms but also for a very natural definition of scales of smoothness spaces, called shearlet coorbit spaces. The aim of this paper is twofold: first we discover isomorphisms between shearlet groups and other well-known groups, namely extended Heisenberg groups and subgroups of the symplectic group. Interestingly, the connected shearlet group with positive dilations has an isomorphic copy in the symplectic group, while this is not true for the full shearlet group with all nonzero dilations. Indeed we prove the general result that there exist, up to adjoint action of the symplectic group, only one embedding of the extended Heisenberg algebra into the Lie algebra of the symplectic group.   Having understood the various group isomorphisms it is natural to ask for the relations between coorbit spaces of isomorphic groups with equivalent representations. These connections are examined in the second part of the paper. We describe how isomorphic groups with equivalent representations lead to isomorphic coorbit spaces. In particular we apply this result to square integrable representations of the connected shearlet groups and metaplectic representations of subgroups of the symplectic group. This implies the definition of metaplectic coorbit spaces.   Besides the usual full and connected shearlet groups we also deal with Toeplitz shearlet groups.
