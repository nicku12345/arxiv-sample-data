A discrete subgroup \Gamma of a locally compact group H is called a uniform lattice if the quotient H/\Gamma is compact. Such an H is called an envelope of \Gamma. In this paper we study the problem of classifying envelopes of various solvable groups including the solvable Baumslag-Solitar groups, lamplighter groups and certain abelian-by-cyclic groups. Our techniques are geometric and quasi-isometric in nature. In particular we show that for every \Gamma we consider there is a finite family of preferred model spaces X such that, up to compact groups, H is a cocompact subgroup of Isom(X).
