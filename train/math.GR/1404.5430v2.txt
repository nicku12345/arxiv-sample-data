We obtain new presentations for the imprimitive complex reflection groups of type (de,e,r) and their braid groups B(de,e,r) for d,r \ge 2. Diagrams for these presentations are proposed. The presentations have much in common with Coxeter presentations of real reflection groups. They are positive and homogeneous, and give rise to quasi-Garside structures. Diagram automorphisms correspond to group automorphisms. The new presentation shows how the braid group B(de,e,r) is a semidirect product of the braid group of affine type \widetilde A_{r-1} and an infinite cyclic group. Elements of B(de,e,r) are visualized as geometric braids on r+1 strings whose first string is pure and whose winding number is a multiple of e. We classify periodic elements, and show that the roots are unique up to conjugacy and that the braid group B(de,e,r) is strongly translation discrete.
