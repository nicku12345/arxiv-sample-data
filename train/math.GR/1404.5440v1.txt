Rodaro and Silva proved that the fixed points submonoid and the periodic points submonoid of a trace monoid endomorphism are always finitely generated. We show that for finitely generated left preGarside monoids, that includs finitely generated preGarside monoids, Garside monoids and Artin monoids, the fixed and periodic points submonoids of any endomorphism are also finitely generated left preGarside monoids under some condition, and in the case of Artin monoids, these submonoids are always Artin monoids too. We also prove algebraically some inequalities, equivalences and non-equivalences between three metrics in finitely generated preGarside monoids, and especially in trace monoids and Garside monoids.
