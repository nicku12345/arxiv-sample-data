Let G=< x,t\mid w> be a one-relator group, where w is a word in x,t. If w is a product of conjugates of x then, associated with w, there is a polynomial A_w(X) over the integers, which in the case when G is a knot group, is the Alexander polynomial of the knot. We prove, subject to certain restrictions on w, that if all roots of A_w(X) are real and positive then G is bi-orderable, and that if G is bi-orderable then at least one root is real and positive. This sheds light on the bi-orderability of certain knot groups and on a question of Clay and Rolfsen. One of the results relies on an extension of work of G. Baumslag on adjunction of roots to groups, and this may have independent interest.
