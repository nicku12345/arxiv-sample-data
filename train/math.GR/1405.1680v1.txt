The aim of this short note is to revisit some old results about groups of intermediate growth and groups of the lamplighter type and to show that the Lamplighter group L=\mathbb{Z}_2\wr \mathbb{Z} is a condensation group and has a minimal presentation by generators and relators. The condensation property is achieved by showing that L belongs to a Cantor subset of the space \mathcal{M}_2 of marked 2-generated groups consisting mostly of groups of intermediate growth.
