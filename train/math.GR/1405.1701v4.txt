To a set \mathcal{B} of 4-subsets of a set \Omega of size n we introduce an invariant called the `hole stabilizer' which generalises a construction of Conway, Elkies and Martin of the Mathieu group M_{12} based on Loyd's `15-puzzle'. It is shown that hole stabilizers may be regarded as objects inside an objective partial group (in the sense of Chermak). We classify pairs (\Omega,\mathcal{B}) with a trivial hole stabilizer, and determine all hole stabilizers associated to 2-(n,4,\lambda) designs with \lambda \leq 2.
