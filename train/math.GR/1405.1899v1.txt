The nonsoluble length \lambda (G) of a finite group G is defined as the number of nonsoluble factors in a shortest normal series each of whose factors either is soluble or is a direct product of nonabelian simple groups. The generalized Fitting height of a finite group G is the least number h=h^*(G) such that F^*_h(G)=G, where F^*_1(G)=F^*(G) is the generalized Fitting subgroup, and F^*_{i+1}(G) is the inverse image of F^*(G/F^*_{i}(G)). It is proved that if a finite group G=AB is factorized by two subgroups of coprime orders, then the nonsoluble length of G is bounded in terms of the generalized Fitting heights of A and B. It is also proved that if, say, B is soluble of derived length d, then the generalized Fitting height of G is bounded in terms of d and the generalized Fitting height of A.
