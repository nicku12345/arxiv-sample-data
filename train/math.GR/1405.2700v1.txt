Let \mathcal{W} be the set of strongly real elements of W, a Coxeter group. Then for w \in \mathcal{W}, e(w), the excess of w, is defined by e(w) = \min\{\ell(x) + \ell(y) - \ell(w) \; | \; w=xy, x^2 = y^2 = 1\}. When W is finite we may also define E(w), the reflection excess of w. The main result established here is that if W is finite and X is a W-conjugacy class, then there exists w \in X such that w has minimal length in X and e(w) = 0 = E(w).
