For a finite Coxeter group W and w an element of W the `excess' of w is defined to be e(w) = \min\{\ell(x) + \ell(y) - \ell(w) \; | \; w=xy, \; x^2 = y^2 = 1\} where \ell is the length function on W. Here we investigate the behaviour of e(w), and a related concept reflection excess, when restricted to standard parabolic subgroups of W. Also the set of involutions inverting w is studied.
