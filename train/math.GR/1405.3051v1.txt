For W a Coxeter group, let \mathcal{W} = \{ w \in W \;| \; w = xy \; \mbox{where} \; x, y \in W \; \mbox{and} \; x^2 = 1 = y^2 \}. If W is finite, then it is well known that W = \mathcal{W}. Suppose that w \in \mathcal{W}. Then the minimum value of \ell(x) + \ell(y) - \ell(w), where x, y \in W with w = xy and x^2 = 1 = y^2, is called the \textit{excess} of w (\ell is the length function of W). The main result established here is that w is always W-conjugate to an element with excess equal to zero.
