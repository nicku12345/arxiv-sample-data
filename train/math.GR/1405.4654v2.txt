Lazard correspondence provides an isomorphism of categories between finitely generated nilpotent pro-p groups of nilpotency class smaller than p and finitely generated nilpotent \mathbb{Z}_p-Lie algebras of nilpotency class smaller than p. Denote by H_{Gr}^i and H_{Lie}^i the group cohomology functors and the Lie cohomology functors respectively. The aim of this paper is to show that for i=0, 1 and 1, and for a given category of modules the cohomology functors H_{Gr}^i\circ \textbf{exp} and H^i_{Lie} are naturally equivalent. A similar result is proven for i=3 and the relative cohomology groups.
