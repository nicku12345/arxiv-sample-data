Let G be a group. A subset X of G is a set of pairwise non-commuting elements if xy is not equal to yx for any two distinct elements x and y in X. If |X|>=|Y| for any other set of pairwise non-commuting elements Y in G, then X is said to be a maximal subset of pairwise non-commuting elements. In this paper we determine the cardinality of a maximal subset of pairwise non-commuting elements for finite minimal non-abelian groups.
