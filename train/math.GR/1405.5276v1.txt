Triple factorisations of finite groups G of the form G=PQP are essential in the study of Lie theory as well as in geometry. Geometrically, each triple factorisation G=PQP corresponds to a G-flag transitive point/line geometry such that `each pair of points is incident with at least one line'. We call such a geometry \emph{collinearly complete}, and duality (interchanging the roles of points and lines) gives rise to the notion of \emph{concurrently complete} geometries. In this paper, we study triple factorisations of the general linear group \mathrm{GL}(V) as PQP where the subgroups P and Q either fix a subspace or fix a decomposition of V as V_1\oplus V_2 with \dim(V_{1})=\dim(V_{2}).
