We extend well-known results in group theory to gyrogroups, especially the isomorphism theorems. We prove that an arbitrary gyrogroup G induces the gyrogroup structure on the symmetric group of G so that Cayley's Theorem is obtained. Introducing the notion of L-subgyrogroups, we show that an L-subgyrogroup partitions G into left cosets. Consequently, if H is an L-subgyrogroup of a finite gyrogroup G, then the order of H divides the order of G.
