We obtain necessary and sufficient conditions when a pseudocompact paratopological group is topological. (2-)pseudocompact and countably compact paratopological groups that are not topological are constructed. It is proved that each 2-pseudocompact paratopological group is pseudocompact and that each Hausdorff \sigma-compact pseudocompact paratopological group is a compact topological group. Our particular attention is devoted to periodic and topologically periodic pseudocompact paratopological groups.
