One of the important open problems in the theory of central simple algebras is to compute the essential dimension of \operatorname{GL}_n/\mu_m, i.e., the essential dimension of a generic division algebra of degree n and exponent dividing m. In this paper we study the essential dimension of groups of the form \[ G=(\operatorname{GL}_{n_1} \times \dots \times \operatorname{GL}_{n_r})/C \, , \] where C is a central subgroup of \operatorname{GL}_{n_1} \times \dots \times \operatorname{GL}_{n_r}. Equivalently, we are interested in the essential dimension of a generic r-tuple (A_1, \dots, A_r) of central simple algebras such that \operatorname{deg}(A_i) = n_i and the Brauer classes of A_1, \dots, A_r satisfy a system of homogeneous linear equations in the Brauer group. The equations depend on the choice of C via the error-correcting code \operatorname{Code}(C) which we naturally associate to C. We focus on the case where n_1, \dots, n_r are powers of the same prime. The upper and lower bounds on \operatorname{ed}(G) we obtain are expressed in terms of coding-theoretic parameters of \operatorname{Code}(C), such as its weight distribution. Surprisingly, for many groups of the above form the essential dimension becomes easier to estimate when r \geq 3; in some cases we even compute the exact value. The Appendix by Athena Nguyen contains an explicit description of the Galois cohomology of groups of the form (\operatorname{GL}_{n_1} \times \dots \times \operatorname{GL}_{n_r})/C. This description and its corollaries are used throughout the paper.
