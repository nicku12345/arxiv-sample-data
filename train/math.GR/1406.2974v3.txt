P-E. Caprace and N. Monod isolate the class \mathscr{X} of locally compact groups for which relatively amenable closed subgroups are amenable. It is unknown if \mathscr{X} is closed under group extension. In this note, we exhibit a large, group extension stable subclass of \mathscr{X}, which suggests \mathscr{X} is indeed closed under group extension. Along the way, we produce generalizations of the class of elementary groups and obtain information on groups outside \mathscr{X}.
