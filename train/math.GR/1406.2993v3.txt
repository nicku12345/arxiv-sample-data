We introduce so-called cone topologies of paratopological groups, which are a wide way to construct counterexamples, especially of examples of compact-like paratopological groups with discontinuous inversion. We found a simple interplay between the algebraic properties of a basic cone subsemigroup S of a group G and compact-like properties of two basic semigroup topologies generated by S on the group G.
