A new sufficient condition under which a semigroup admits no finite identity basis has been recently suggested in a joint paper by Karl Auinger, Yuzhu Chen, Xun Hu, Yanfeng Luo, and the author (see http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.0783). Here we apply this condition to show the absence of a finite identity basis for the semigroup \mathrm{UT}_3(\mathbb{R}) of all upper triangular real 3\times 3-matrices with 0s and/or 1s on the main diagonal. The result holds also for the case when \mathrm{UT}_3(\mathbb{R}) is considered as an involution semigroup under the reflection with respect to the secondary diagonal.
