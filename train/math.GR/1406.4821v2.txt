One looks at expansive subgroups in particular examples of Roquette groups. This study is motivated by the importance of expansive subgroups in the theory of stabilizing bisets highlighted in [BouThe]. In this paper we prove the non-existence of expansive subgroups with trivial G-core in different examples of Roquette groups G.
