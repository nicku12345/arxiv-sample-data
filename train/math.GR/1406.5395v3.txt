Given a group word w in k variables, a finite group G and g\in G, we consider the number N_{w,G}(g) of k-tuples g_1,\dots ,g_k of elements of G such that w(g_1,\dots ,g_k)=g. In this work we study the functions N_{w,G} for the class of nilpotent groups of nilpotency class 2. We show that, for the groups in this class, N_{w,G}(1)\geq |G|^{k-1}, an inequality that can be improved to N_{w,G}(1)\geq |G|^k/|G_w| (G_w is the set of values taken by w on G) if G has odd order. This last result is explained by the fact that the functions N_{w,G} are characters of G in this case. For groups of even order, all that can be said is that N_{w,G} is a generalized character, something that is false in general for groups of nilpotency class greater than 2. We characterize group theoretically when N_{x^n,G} is a character if G is a 2-group of nilpotency class 2. Finally we also address the (much harder) problem of studying if N_{w,G}(g)\geq |G|^{ k-1} for g\in G_w, proving that this is the case for the free p-groups of nilpotency class 2 and exponent p.
