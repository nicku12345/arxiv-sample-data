The Tarski number of an action of a group G on a set X is the minimal number of pieces in a paradoxical decomposition of it. For any k>3 we construct a faithful transitive action of a free group of rank k-1 with Tarski number k. Using similar techniques we construct a group action of a free group F with Tarski number 6 such that the Tarski numbers of restrictions of this action to finite index subgroups of F are arbitrarily large.
