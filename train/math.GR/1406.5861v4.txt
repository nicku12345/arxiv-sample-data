Similar to the symplectic cases, there is a family of fourteen orthogonal hypergeometric groups with a maximally unipotent monodromy (cf. Table 1.1). We show that two of the fourteen orthogonal hypergeometric groups associated to the pairs of parameters (0, 0, 0, 0, 0), (\frac{1}{6}, \frac{1}{6}, \frac{5}{6}, \frac{5}{6}, \frac{1}{2}); and (0, 0, 0, 0, 0), (\frac{1}{4}, \frac{1}{4}, \frac{3}{4}, \frac{3}{4}, \frac{1}{2}) are arithmetic.   We also give a table (cf. Table 2.1) which lists the quadratic forms \mathrm{Q} preserved by these fourteen hypergeometric groups, and their two linearly independent \mathrm{Q}- orthogonal isotropic vectors in \mathbb{Q}^5; it shows in particular that the orthogonal groups of these quadratic forms have \mathbb{Q}- rank two.
