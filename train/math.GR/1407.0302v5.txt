A notion of \emph{graph-wreath product} is introduced. We obtain sufficient conditions for these products to satisfy the topologically inspired finiteness condition type \operatorname{F}_n. Under various additional assumptions we show that these conditions are necessary. Our results generalise results of Cornulier about wreath products in case n=2. Graph-wreath products include classical permutational wreath products and semidirect products of right-angled Artin groups by groups of automorphisms amongst others.
