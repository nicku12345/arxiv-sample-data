Let \pi be a set of primes. By H.Wielandt definition, {\it Sylow \pi-theorem} holds for a finite group G if all maximal \pi-subgroups of G are conjugate. In the paper, the following statement is proven. Assume that \pi is a union of disjoint subsets \sigma and \tau and a finite group G possesses a \pi-Hall subgroup which is a direct product of a \sigma-subgroup and a \tau-subgroup. Furthermore, assume that both the Sylow \sigma-theorem and \tau-theorem hold for G. Then the Sylow \pi-theorem holds for G. This result confirms a conjecture posed by H.\,Wielandt in~1959.
