Given a finitely presented group Q, we produce a short exact sequence 1\to N \hookrightarrow G \twoheadrightarrow Q \to 1 such that G is a torsion-free Gromov hyperbolic group without the unique product property and N is without the unique product property and has Kazhdan's Property (T). Varying Q, we show a wide diversity of concrete examples of Gromov hyperbolic groups without the unique product property. As an application, we obtain Tarski monster groups without the unique product property.
