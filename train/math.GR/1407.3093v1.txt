An endomorphisms \varphi of an abelian group A is said inertial if each subgroup H of A has finite index in H+\varphi (H).   We study the ring of inertial endomorphisms of an abelian group. Here we obtain a satisfactory description modulo the ideal of finitary endomorphisms.   Also the corresponding problem for vector spaces is considered.   For the characterization of inertial endomorphisms of an abelian group see arXiv:1310.4625 .   The group of invertible inertial endomorphisms has been studied in arXiv:1403.4193 .
