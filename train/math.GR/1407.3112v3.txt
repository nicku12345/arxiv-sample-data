For each finite group G, we define the Grothendieck-Teichm\"uller group of G, denoted GT(G), and explore its properties. The theory of dessins d'enfants shows that the inverse limit of GT(G) as G varies can be identified with a group defined by Drinfeld and containing the absolute Galois group of the rational field.   We give in particular an identification of GT(G), in the case when G is simple and non-abelian, with a certain very explicit group of permutations that can be analyzed easily. With the help of a computer, we obtain precise information for G= PSL(2, q) when q= 4, 7, 8, 9, 11, 13, 16, 17, 19, and we treat A7, PSL(3, 3) and M11.   In the rest of the paper we give a conceptual explanation for the technique which we use in our calculations. It turns out that the classical action of the Grothendieck-Teichm\"uller group on dessins d'enfants can be refined to an action on equivariant dessins, which we define, and this elucidates much of the first part.
