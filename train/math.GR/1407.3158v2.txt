Surveying some of the recent developments on approximate subgroups and super-strong approximation for thin groups, we describe the Bourgain-Gamburd method for establishing spectral gaps for finite groups and the proof of the classification of approximate subgroups of semisimple algebraic groups over finite fields. We then give a proof of the super-strong approximation for mod p quotients via random matrix products and a quantitative version of strong approximation. Some applications to the group sieve are also presented.
