We consider finite 2-dimensional polyhedral complexes, equipped with piecewise non-positively curved, locally CAT(0) metrics. We give conditions on the complex X that ensure that its fundamental group contains a surface subgroup. Concrete examples covered by our methods include compact quotients of sufficiently thick Fuchsian buildings, where the lattice acts freely and the quotient has at least two vertices.
