We describe an underlying right angled building structure of any graph product of buildings. We describe the automorphism group of the graph product of buildings. We show that the notion of generalized graph product of a collection of groups, each with an action on a building, corresponds to the group of automorphisms generated via lifts. It follows that if each building is finite, then the generalized graph product is residually finite.
