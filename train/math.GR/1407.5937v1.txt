For every non-nilpotent finite group G, there exists at least one proper subgroup M such that G is the setwise product of a finite number of conjugates of M. We define \gamma_{\text{cp}}\left( G\right)  to be the smallest number k such that G is a product, in some order, of k pairwise conjugated proper subgroups of G. We prove that if G is non-solvable then \gamma_{\text{cp}}\left( G\right) \leq36 while if G is solvable then \gamma_{\text{cp}}\left( G\right)  can attain any integer value bigger than 2, while, on the other hand, \gamma_{\text{cp}}\left( G\right) \leq4\log_{2}\left\vert G\right\vert .
