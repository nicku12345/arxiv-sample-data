The Chermak-Delgado lattice of a finite group is a dual, modular sublattice of the subgroup lattice of the group. This paper considers groups with a quasi-antichain interval in the Chermak-Delgado lattice, ultimately proving that if there is a quasi-antichain interval between L and H with L \leq H then there exists a prime p such that the quotient H / L is an elementary abelian p-group and the number of atoms in the quasi-antichain is one more than a power of p. In the case where the Chermak-Delgado lattice of the entire group is a quasi-antichain, the relationship between the number of abelian atoms and the prime p is examined; additionally several examples of group with a quasi-antichain Chermak-Delgado lattice are constructed.
