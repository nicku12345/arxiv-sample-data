Let G be a finite group, and let V be a completely reducible faithful G-module. It has been known for a long time that if G is abelian, then G has a regular orbit on V. In this paper we show that G has an orbit of size at least |G/G'| on V. This generalizes earlier work of the authors, where the same bound was proved under the additional hypothesis that G is solvable. For completely reducible modules it also strengthens the 1989 result |G/G'|<|V| by Aschbacher and Guralnick.
