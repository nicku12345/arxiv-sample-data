We construct torsion-free hyperbolic groups without unique product whose subgroups up to some given finite index are themselves non-unique product groups. This is achieved by generalising a construction of Comerford to graphical small cancellation presentations, showing that for every subgroup H of a graphical small cancellation group there exists a free group F such that H*F admits a graphical small cancellation presentation.
