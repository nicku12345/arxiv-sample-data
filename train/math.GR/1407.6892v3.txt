We study congruences of the semigroup \mathscr{I\!O}\!_{\infty}(\mathbb{Z}^n_{\operatorname{lex}}) of monotone injective partial selfmaps of the set of L_n\times_{\operatorname{lex}}\mathbb{Z} having co-finite domain and image, where L_n\times_{\operatorname{lex}}\mathbb{Z} is the lexicographic product of n-elements chain and the set of integers with the usual linear order. The structure of the sublattice of congruences on \mathscr{I\!O}\!_{\infty}(\mathbb{Z}^n_{\operatorname{lex}}) which contain in the least group congruence is described.
