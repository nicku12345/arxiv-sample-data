The group \mathop{\rm PL}_+(I) of increasing piecewise linear self-homeomorphisms of the interval I=[0,1] may not be assigned a topology in such a way that it becomes a Polish group. The same statement holds for the groups \mathop{\rm Homeo}_+^{Lip}(I) of bi-Lipschitz homeomorphisms of I, and \mathop{\rm Diff}_+^{1+\epsilon}(I) of diffeomorphisms of I whose derivatives are H\"older continuous with exponent \epsilon.
