Let {\cal B}_n be the variety of groups satisfying the law x^n=1. It is proved that for every sufficiently large prime p, say p>10^{10}, the product {\cal B}_p{\cal B}_p cannot be defined by a finite set of identities. This solves the problem formulated by C.K. Gupta and A.N. Krasilnikov in 2003. We also find the axiomatic and the basis ranks of the variety {\cal B}_p{\cal B}_p. For this goal, we improve the estimate for the basis rank of the product of group varieties obtained by G. Baumslag, B.H. Neumann, H. Neumann and P.M. Neumann long ago.
