Richard Thompson's group F is the group of piecewise linear homeomorphisms of the unit interval with a finite number of break points, all at dyadic rational numbers (their denominators are powers of 2) and with slopes which are powers of 2. A discrete group G is amenable if there exists a finitely-additive probability measure on G which is invariant under left translations and is defined on all subsets of G. The amenability question for F is a well known open problem. In this paper we prove that group F is not amenable.
