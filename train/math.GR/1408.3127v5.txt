We prove that the group of homeomorphisms of the circle introduced by the author with Justin Moore (Groups, Geometry and Dynamics 2015) is of type F_{\infty}. This makes the group the first example of a type F_{\infty} group which is nonamenable and does not contain nonabelian free subgroups. To prove our result we provide a certain generalisation of cube complexes, which we refer to as cluster complexes. We also obtain a computable normal form, or a canonical unique choice of a word for each element of the group.
