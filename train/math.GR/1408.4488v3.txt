We prove that infinitely presented graphical Gr(7) small cancellation groups are acylindrically hyperbolic. In particular, infinitely presented classical C(7)-groups and, hence, classical C'(\frac{1}{6})-groups are acylindrically hyperbolic. We also prove the analogous statements for the larger class of graphical small cancellation presentations over free products. We construct infinitely presented classical C'(\frac{1}{6})-groups that provide new examples of divergence functions of groups.
