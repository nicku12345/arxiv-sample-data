Every infinite group G of regular cardinality can be partitioned G=A_1\cup A_2 so that G\neq FA_1, G\neq FA_2 for every subset F\subset G of cardinality |F|<|G|. The first author asked whether the same is true for each group G of singular cardinality. We show that an answer depends on the algebraic structure of G. In particular, this is so for each free group but the statement does not hold for every Abelian group G of singular cardinality. As an application, we prove that every Abelian group of singular cardinality k admits maximal translation invariant k-bounded topology that impossible for all groups of regular cardinality.
