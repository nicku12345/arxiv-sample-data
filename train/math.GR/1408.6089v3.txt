Behrstock and Dru\c{t}u raised a question about the existence of Morse geodesics in CAT(0) spaces with divergence function strictly greater than r^n and strictly less than r^{n+1}, where n is an integer greater than 1. In this paper, we answer the question of Behrstock and Dru\c{t}u by showing that for each real number s\geq 2, there is a CAT(0) space X with a proper and cocompact action of some finitely generated group such that X contains a Morse bi-infinite geodesic with the divergence equivalent to r^s.
