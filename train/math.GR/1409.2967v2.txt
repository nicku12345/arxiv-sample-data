The spectrum of a finite group is the set of its elements orders. Groups are said to be isospectral if their spectra coincide. For every finite simple exceptional group L=E_7(q), we prove that each finite group isospectral to L is isomorphic to a group G squeezed between L and its automorphism group, that is L\leq G\leq \operatorname{Aut}L; in particular, up-to isomorphism, there are only finitely many such groups. This assertion, together with a series of previously obtained results, implies that the same is true for every finite simple exceptional group except the group {}^3D_4(2).
