The operator of weak commutativity between isomorphic groups H and H^{\psi } was defined by Sidki as \begin{equation*} \chi (H)=\left\langle H\,H^{\psi }\mid \lbrack h,h^{\psi }]=1\,\forall \,h\in H\right\rangle \text{.} \end{equation*}% It is known that the operator \chi  preserves group properties such as finiteness, solubility and also nilpotency for finitely generated groups. We prove in this work that \chi  preserves the properties of being polycyclic and polycyclic by finite. As a consequence of this result, we conclude that the non-abelian tensor square H\otimes H of a group H, defined by Brown and Loday, preserves the property polycyclic by finite. This last result extends that of Blyth and Morse who proved that H\otimes H is polycyclic if H is polycyclic.
