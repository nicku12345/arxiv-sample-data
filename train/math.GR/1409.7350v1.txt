Let G be a group and let X be a transitive G-space. We classify the subsets of X with respect to a translation invariant ideal \mathcal{J} in the Boolean algebra of all subsets of X, introduce and apply the relative combinatorical derivations of subsets of X. Using the standard action of G on the Stone-\check{C}ech compactification \beta X of the discrete space X, we characterize the points p\in\beta X isolated in Gp and describe a size of a subset of X in terms of its ultracompanions in \beta X. We introduce and characterize scattered and sparse subsets of X from different points of view.
