Suppose that a finite group G admits an automorphism \varphi  of order 2^n such that the fixed-point subgroup C_G(\varphi ^{2^{n-1}}) of the involution \varphi ^{2^{n-1}} is nilpotent of class c. Let m=|C_G(\varphi)| be the number of fixed points of \varphi. It is proved that G has a characteristic soluble subgroup of derived length bounded in terms of n,c whose index is bounded in terms of m,n,c. A similar result is also proved for Lie rings.
