We show that the class of \mathcal{C}-hereditarily conjugacy separable groups is closed under taking arbitrary graph products whenever the class \mathcal{C} is an extension closed variety of finite groups. As a consequence we show that the class of \mathcal{C}-conjugacy separable groups is closed under taking arbitrary graph products. In particular, we show that right angled Coxeter groups are hereditarily conjugacy separable and 2-hereditarily conjugacy separable, and we show that infinitely generated right angled Artin groups are hereditarily conjugacy separable and p-hereditarily conjugacy separable for every prime number p.
