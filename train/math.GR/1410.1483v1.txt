Let G and C be two discrete abelian groups. It is known that Pext(C,G) is a subgroup of Ext(C,G). In this paper, we introduce the t-extensions of G by C. We will show that the set of all t-extensions of G by C is a subgroup of Ext(C,G) which contains Pext(C,G). Fulp and Griffith [4] determined the LCA groups G such that Ext(C,G)=0 for all compact connected groups C. Using the group of t-extensions, we determine the LCA groups G such that Pext(C,G)=0 for all compact connected groups C.
