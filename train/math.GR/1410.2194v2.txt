In this paper we define a congruence \eta^{\ast} on semigroups. For the finite semigroups S, \eta^{\ast} is the smallest congruence relation such that S/\eta^{\ast} is a nilpotent semigroup (in the sense of Malcev). In order to study the congruence relation \eta^{\ast} on finite semigroups, we define a \textbf{CS}-diagonal finite regular Rees matrix semigroup. We prove that, if S is a \textbf{CS}-diagonal finite regular Rees matrix semigroup then S/\eta^{\ast} is inverse. Also, if S is a completely regular finite semigroup, then S/\eta^{\ast} is a Clifford semigroup.   We show that, for every non-null principal factor A/B of S, there is a special principal factor C/D such that every element of A\setminus B is \eta^{\ast}-equivalent with some element of C\setminus D. We call the principal factor C/D, the \eta^{\ast}-root of A/B. All \eta^{\ast}-roots are \textbf{CS}-diagonal. If certain elements of S act in the special way on the \textbf{R}-classes of a \textbf{CS}-diagonal principal factor then it is not an \eta^{\ast}-root. Some of these results are also expressed in terms of pseudovarieties of semigroups.
