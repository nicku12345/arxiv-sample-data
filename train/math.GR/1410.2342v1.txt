We introduce a topological property for finitely generated groups called stackable that implies the existence of an inductive procedure for constructing van Kampen diagrams with respect to a particular finite presentation. We also define algorithmically stackable groups, for which this procedure is an algorithm. This property gives a common model for algorithms arising from both rewriting systems and almost convexity for groups.
