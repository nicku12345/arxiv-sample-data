We show that the largest character degree of an alternating group A_n with n\geq 5 can be bounded in terms of smaller degrees in the sense that \[ b(A_n)^2<\sum_{\psi\in\textrm{Irr}(A_n),\,\psi(1)< b(A_n)}\psi(1)^2, \] where \textrm{Irr}(A_n) and b(A_n) respectively denote the set of irreducible complex characters of A_n and the largest degree of a character in \textrm{Irr}(A_n). This confirms a prediction of I. M. Isaacs for the alternating groups and answers a question of M. Larsen, G. Malle, and P. H. Tiep.
