This paper is a sequel to "Representation growth of maximal class groups: non-exceptional primes". We use a constructive method to calculate some exceptional cases of p-local representation zeta functions of a family of finitely generated nilpotent groups M_n with maximal nilpotency class. Using the machinery of the constructive method from the prequel paper we construct all irreducible representations of degree p^N for all N\in \mathbb{N} for the group M_{p+1} for a fixed prime p. We also construct all irreducible representations of degree 2^N for the group M_4. Together with the main result from the prequel, this gives us a complete understanding of the irreducible representations of the groups M_3 and M_4, along with their global representation zeta functions.
