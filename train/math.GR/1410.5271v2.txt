A group G is invariably generated by a subset S of G if G= s^{g(s)} \mid s\in S for each choice of g(s) \in G, s \in S. Answering two questions posed by Kantor, Lubotzky and Shalev, we prove that the free prosoluble group of rank d \ge 2 cannot be invariably generated by a finite set of elements, while the free solvable profinite group of rank d and derived length l is invariably generated by precisely l(d-1)+1 elements.
