For a fixed n\ge2, the Houghton group H_n consists of bijections of X_n=\{1,\ldots,n\} \times \mathbb{N} that are `eventually translations' of each copy of \mathbb{N}. The Houghton groups have been shown to have solvable conjugacy problem. In general solvable conjugacy problem does not imply that all finite extensions and finite index subgroups have solvable conjugacy problem. Our main theorem is that a stronger result holds: for any n\ge2 and any group G commensurable to H_n, G has solvable conjugacy problem.
