If a group G is the union of proper subgroups H_1, \dots, H_k, we say that the collection \{H_1, \dots H_k \} is a cover of G, and the size of a minimal cover (supposing one exists) is the covering number of G, denoted \sigma(G). Mar\'oti showed that \sigma(S_n) = 2^{n-1} for n odd and sufficiently large, and he also gave asymptotic bounds for n even. In this paper, we determine the exact value of \sigma(S_n) when n is divisible by 6.
