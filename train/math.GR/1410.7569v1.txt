A finite group G is \emph{coprimely-invariably generated} if there exists a set of generators \{g_1, ..., g_u\} of G with the property that the orders |g_1|, ..., |g_u| are pairwise coprime and that for all x_1, ..., x_u \in G the set \{g_1^{x_1}, ..., g_u^{x_u}\} generates G.   We show that if G is coprimely-invariably generated, then G can be generated with three elements, or two if G is soluble, and that G has zero presentation rank. As a corollary, we show that if G is any finite group such that no proper subgroup has the same exponent as G, then G has zero presentation rank. Furthermore, we show that every finite simple group is coprimely-invariably generated.   Along the way, we show that for each finite simple group S, and for each partition \pi_1, ..., \pi_u of the primes dividing |S|, the product of the number k_{\pi_i}(S) of conjugacy classes of \pi_i-elements satisfies \prod_{i=1}^u k_{\pi_i}(S) \leq \frac{|S|}{2| Out S|}.
