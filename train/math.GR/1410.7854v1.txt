The minimal faithful permutation degree \mu(G) of a finite group G is the least nonnegative integer n such that G embeds in the symmetric group \Sym(n). Clearly \mu(G \times H) \le \mu(G) + \mu(H) for all finite groups G and H. Wright (1975) proves that equality occurs when G and H are nilpotent and exhibits an example of strict inequality where G\times H embeds in \Sym(15).   Saunders (2010) produces an infinite family of examples of permutation groups G and H where \mu(G \times H) < \mu(G) + \mu(H), including the example of Wright's as a special case. The smallest groups in Saunders' class embed in \Sym(10). In this paper we prove that 10 is minimal in the sense that \mu(G \times H) = \mu(G) + \mu(H) for all groups G and H such that \mu(G\times H)\le 9.
