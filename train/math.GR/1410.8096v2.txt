In studying nilpotent groups, the lower central series and other variations can be used to construct an associated \mathbb{Z}^+-graded Lie ring, which is a powerful method to inspect a group. Indeed, the process can be generalized substantially by introducing \mathbb{N}^d-graded Lie rings. We compute the adjoint refinements of the lower central series of the unipotent subgroups of the classical Chevalley groups over the field \mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z} of rank d. We prove that, for all the classical types, this characteristic filter is a series of length \Theta(d^2) with nearly all factors having p-bounded order.
