The M\"obius function for a group, G, was introduced in 1936 by Hall in order to count ordered generating sets of G. In this paper we determine the M\"obius function of the simple small Ree groups, R(q)={}^2G_2(q) where q=3^{2m+1} for m>0, using their 2-transitive permutation representation of degree q^3+1 and describe their maximal subgroups in terms of this representation. We then use this to determine \vertEpi(\Gamma,G)\vert for various \Gamma, such as F_2 or the modular group PSL_2(\mathbb{Z}), with applications to Grothendieck's theory of dessins d'enfants as well as probabilistic generation of the small Ree groups.
