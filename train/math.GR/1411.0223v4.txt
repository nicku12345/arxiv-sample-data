In an earlier paper, the second-named author has described the identities holding in the so-called Catalan monoids. Here we extend this description to a certain family of Hecke--Kiselman monoids including the Kiselman monoids \mathcal{K}_n. As a consequence, we conclude that the identities of \mathcal{K}_n are nonfinitely based for every n\ge 4 and exhibit a finite identity basis for the identities of each of the monoids \mathcal{K}_2 and \mathcal{K}_3.   In the third version a question left open in the initial submission has beed answered.
