Let F_n be the free group of rank n with free basis X=\{x_1,\dots,x_n \}. A palindrome is a word in X^{\pm 1} that reads the same backwards as forwards. The palindromic automorphism group \Pi A_n of F_n consists of those automorphisms that map each x_i to a palindrome. In this paper, we investigate linear representations of \Pi A_n, and prove that \Pi A_2 is linear. We obtain conjugacy classes of involutions in \Pi A_2, and investigate residual nilpotency of \Pi A_n and some of its subgroups. Let IA_n be the group of those automorphisms of F_n that act trivially on the abelianisation, P I_n be the palindromic Torelli group of F_n, and E \Pi A_n be the elementary palindromic automorphism group of F_n. We prove that PI_n=IA_n \cap E \Pi A_n'. This result strengthens a recent result of Fullarton.
