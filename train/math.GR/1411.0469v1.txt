For a group G generated by k elements, the Nielsen equivalence classes are defined as orbits of the action of \operatorname{Aut} F_k, the automorphism group of the free group of rank k, on the set of generating k-tuples of G.   Let p\geq 3 be prime and G_p the Gupta-Sidki p-group. We prove that there are infinitely many Nielsen equivalence classes on generating pairs of G_p.
