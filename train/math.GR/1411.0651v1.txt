A subgroup H of a group G is commensurated in G if for each g\in G, gHg^{-1}\cap H has finite index in both H and gHg^{-1}. If there is a sequence of subgroups H=Q_0\prec Q_1\prec ...\prec Q_{k}\prec Q_{k+1}=G where Q_i is commensurated in Q_{i+1} for all i, then Q_0 is subcommensurated in G. In this paper we introduce the notion of the simple connectivity at infinity of a finitely generated group (in analogy with that for finitely presented groups). Our main result is: If a finitely generated group G contains an infinite, finitely generated, subcommensurated subgroup H, of infinite index in G, then G is 1-ended and semistable at \infty. If additionally, H is finitely presented and 1-ended, then G is simply connected at \infty. A normal subgroup of a group is commensurated, so this result is a strict generalization of a number of results, including the main theorems of G. Conner and M. Mihalik \cite{CM}, B. Jackson \cite{J}, V. M. Lew \cite{L}, M. Mihalik \cite{M1}and \cite{M2}, and J. Profio \cite{P}.
