According to Li, Nicholson and Zan, a group G is said to be morphic if, for every pair N_{1}, N_{2} of normal subgroups, each of the conditions G/N_{1} \cong N_{2} and G/N_{2} \cong N_{1} implies the other. Finite, homocyclic p-groups are morphic, and so is the nonabelian group of order p^{3} and exponent p, for p an odd prime. It follows from results of An, Ding and Zhan on self dual groups that these are the only examples of finite, morphic p-groups. In this paper we obtain the same result under a weaker hypotesis.
