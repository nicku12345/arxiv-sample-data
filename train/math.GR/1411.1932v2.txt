Glauberman's Z^*-theorem and analogous statements for odd primes show that, for any prime p and any finite group G with Sylow p-subgroup S, the centre of G/O_{p^\prime}(G) is determined by the fusion system \mathcal{F}_S(G). Building on these results we show a statement that seems a priori more general: For any normal subgroup H of G with O_{p^\prime}(H)=1, the centralizer C_S(H) is expressed in terms of the fusion system \mathcal{F}_S(H) and its normal subsystem induced by H.
