We investigate the endomorphism monoids of certain finite p-groups of order p^8 first studied by Jonah and Konvisser in 1975 as examples for finite p-groups with abelian automorphism group, and we show some necessary conditions for a finite p-group to have commutative endomorphism monoid. As a by-product, apart from formulas for the number of conjugacy classes of endomorphisms of said groups, we will be able to derive the following: There exist nonabelian groups with commutative endomorphism monoid, and having commutative endomorphism monoid is a group property strictly stronger than having abelian automorphism group. Furthermore, using a result of Curran, this will enable us to give, for all primes p, examples of finite p-groups which are direct products and have abelian automorphism group.
