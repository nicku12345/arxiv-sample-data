We construct a central Lie group extension for the Lie group of compactly supported sections of a Lie group bundle over a sigma-compact base manifold. This generalises a result of the paper "Central extensions of groups of sections" by Neeb and Wockel, where the base manifold is assumed to be compact. In the second part of the paper, we show that this extension is universal and obtain a generalisation of a corresponding result in the paper "Universal central extensions of gauge algebras and groups" by Janssens and Wockel, where again (in the case of Lie group extensions) the base manifold is assumed compact.
