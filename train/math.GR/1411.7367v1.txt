We prove that infinitely presented classical C(6) small cancellation groups are SQ-universal. We extend the result to graphical Gr_*(6)-groups over free products. For every p\in\mathbb{N}, we construct uncountably many pairwise non-quasi-isometric groups that admit classical C(p)-presentations but no graphical Gr'(\frac{1}{6})-presentations.
