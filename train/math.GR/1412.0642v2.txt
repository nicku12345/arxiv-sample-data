We show that non-abelian two-generator subgroups of right-angled Artin groups are quasi-isometrically embedded free groups. This provides an alternate proof of a theorem of A. Baudisch: that all two-generator subgroups are free or free abelian. Additionally, it shows that they are quasi-isometrically embedded. Our theorem also gives a method for detecting groups that are not isomorphic to a subgroup of any RAAG. We present some counterexamples in subgroups with more than two generators.
