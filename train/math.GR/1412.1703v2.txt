In this paper we derive necessary and sufficient homological and cohomological conditions for profinite groups and modules to be of type \operatorname{FP}_n over a profinite ring R, analogous to the Bieri-Eckmann criteria for abstract groups. We use these to prove that the class of groups of type \operatorname{FP}_n is closed under extensions, quotients by subgroups of type \operatorname{FP}_n, proper amalgamated free products and proper \operatorname{HNN}-extensions, for each n. We show, as a consequence of this, that elementary amenable profinite groups of finite rank are of type \operatorname{FP}_\infty over all profinite R. For any class \mathcal{C} of finite groups closed under subgroups, quotients and extensions, we also construct pro-\mathcal{C} groups of type \operatorname{FP}_n but not of type \operatorname{FP}_{n+1} over \mathbb{Z}_{\hat{\mathcal{C}}} for each n. Finally, we show that the natural analogue of the usual condition measuring when pro-p groups are of type \operatorname{FP}_n fails for general profinite groups, answering in the negative the profinite analogue of a question of Kropholler.
