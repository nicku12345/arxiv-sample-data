Suppose R is a profinite ring. We construct a large class of profinite groups \widehat{{\scriptstyle\bf L}'{\scriptstyle\bf H}_R}\mathfrak{F}, including all soluble profinite groups and profinite groups of finite cohomological dimension over R. We show that, if G \in \widehat{{\scriptstyle\bf L}'{\scriptstyle\bf H}_R}\mathfrak{F} is of type \operatorname{FP}_\infty over R, then there is some n such that H_R^n(G,R [[ G ]]) \neq 0, and deduce that torsion-free soluble pro-p groups of type \operatorname{FP}_\infty over \mathbb{Z}_p have finite rank, thus answering the torsion-free case of a conjecture of Kropholler.
