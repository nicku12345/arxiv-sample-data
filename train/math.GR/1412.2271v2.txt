Let \Gamma_d(q) denote the group whose Cayley graph with respect to a particular generating set is the Diestel-Leader graph DL_d(q), as described by Bartholdi, Neuhauser and Woess. We compute both Aut(\Gamma_d(q)) and Out(\Gamma_d(q)) for d \geq 2, and apply our results to count twisted conjugacy classes in these groups when d \geq 3. Specifically, we show that when d \geq 3, the groups \Gamma_d(q) have property R_{\infty}, that is, every automorphism has an infinite number of twisted conjugacy classes. In contrast, when d=2 the lamplighter groups \Gamma_2(q)=L_q = {\mathbb Z}_q \wr {\mathbb Z} have property R_{\infty} if and only if (q,6) \neq 1.
