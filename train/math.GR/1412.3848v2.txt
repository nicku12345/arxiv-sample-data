We explore the Mayer-Vietoris sequence developed by Chiswell for the fundamental group of a graph of groups when vertex groups satisfy some vanishing assumption on the first cohomology (e.g. property (T), or vanishing of the first \ell^2-Betti number). We characterize the vanishing of first reduced cohomology of unitary representations when vertex stabilizer have property (T). We find necessary and sufficient conditions for the vanishing of the first \ell^2-Betti number. We also study the associated Haagerup cocycle and show that it vanishes in first reduced cohomology precisely when the action is elementary.
