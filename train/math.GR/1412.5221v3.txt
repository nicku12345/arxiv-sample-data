The paper deals with the solution of Shevrin ans Sapir problem. Infinite finitely presented nilsemigroup is constructed. The construction is based on aperiodic tilings, Goodman-Strauss type theorems on uniformly elliptic space. Space is called {\it uniformly elliptic} iff there is universal constant \lambda>0 such that any two points A and B on distant D can be joined by family of geodesic lines generating a disc of wideness \lambda\cdot D.
