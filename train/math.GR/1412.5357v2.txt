In this paper we use JSJ-decompositions to formalise a folk conjecture recorded by Pride on the structure of one-relator groups with torsion. We prove a slightly weaker version of the conjecture, which implies that the structure of one-relator groups with torsion closely resemble the structure of torsion-free hyperbolic groups.
