A proper subgroup H of a group G is said to be: \Bbb{P}-subnormal in G if there exists a chain of subgroups H=H_0 < H_1< ... < H_{n}=G such that |H_{i}:H_{i-1}| is a prime for i=1,...,n; \Bbb{P}-abnormal in G if for every two subgroups K\leq L of G, where H\leq K, |L:K| is not a prime.   In this paper we describe finite groups in which every non-identity subgroup is either \Bbb{P}-subnormal or \Bbb{P}-abnormal.
