The Sylow p-subgroups of the symmetric group S_p^n satisfy the appropriate generalization of Maschke's Theorem to the case of a p'-group acting on a (not necessarily abelian) p-group. Moreover, some known results about the Sylow p-subgroups of S_p^n are stated in a form that is true for all primes p.
