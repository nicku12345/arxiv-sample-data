Let P_0(A_n), \widetilde{P}_0(A_n), P_0(\mathcal{T}(A_n)) and \mathcal{O}_0(A_n) be respectively the proper power graph, the proper quotient power graph, the proper power type graph and the proper order graph of the alternating group A_n, for n\geq 3. We determine the number of the components of those graphs. In particular, we prove that the power graph P(A_n) is 2-connected if and only if the power type graph P(\mathcal{T}(A_n)) is 2-connected, if and only if either n = 3 or none of n, n-1, n-2, \frac{n}{2} and {\frac{n-1}{2}} is a prime. We also give some information on the properties of those components.
