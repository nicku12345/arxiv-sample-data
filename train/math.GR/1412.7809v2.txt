We study a family of hereditarily just infinite profinite groups obtained by iterated wreath products introduced by J. Wilson in 2010. We find explicit generators for this family in a number of cases using combinatorial methods. We then discuss determination of the lower rank for this family. Finally we examine whether the groups in this family admit a finite profinite presentation.
