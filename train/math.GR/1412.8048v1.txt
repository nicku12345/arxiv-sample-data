We say that x,y\in \Gamma are in the same \phi-twisted conjugacy class and write x\sim_\phi y if there exists an element \gamma\in \Gamma such that y=\gamma x\phi(\gamma^{-1}). This is an equivalence relation on \Gamma called the \phi-twisted conjugacy. Let R(\phi) denote the number of \phi-twisted conjugacy classes in \Gamma. If R(\phi) is infinite for all \phi\in Aut(\Gamma), we say that \Gamma has the R_\infty-property.   The purpose of this note is to show that the symmetric group S_\infty, the Houghton groups and the pure symmetric automorphism groups have the R_\infty-property. We show, also, that the Richard Thompson group T has the R_\infty-property. We obtain a general result establishing the R_\infty-property of finite direct product of finitely generated groups.
