Recently Vaughan Jones showed that the R. Thompson group F encodes in a natural way all knots, and a certain subgroup \vec F of F encodes all oriented knots. We answer several questions of Jones about \vec F. In particular we prove that the subgroup \vec F is generated by x_0x_1, x_1x_2, x_2x_3 (where x_i, i=0,1,2,... are the standard generators of F) and is isomorphic to F_3, the analog of F where all slopes are powers of 3 and break points are 3-adic rationals. We also show that \vec F coincides with its commensurator. Hence the linearization of the permutational representation of F on F/\vec F is irreducible.
