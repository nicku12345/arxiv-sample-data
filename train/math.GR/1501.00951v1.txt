A group is SimpHAtic if it acts geometrically on a simply connected simplicially hereditarily aspherical (SimpHAtic) complex. We show that finitely presented normal subgroups of SimpHAtic groups are either: finite, or of finite index, or virtually free. This result applies, in particular, to normal subgroups of systolic groups. We prove similar strong restrictions on group extensions for other classes of asymptotically aspherical groups. The proof relies on studying homotopy types at infinity of groups in question. In Appendix we present the topological 2-dimensional quasi-Helly property of systolic complexes.
