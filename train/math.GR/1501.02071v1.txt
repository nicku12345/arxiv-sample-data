It is proved that if a finite p-soluble group G admits an automorphism \varphi of order p^n having at most m fixed points on every \varphi-invariant elementary abelian p'-section of G, then the p-length of G is bounded above in terms of p^n and m; if in addition the group G is soluble, then the Fitting height of G is bounded above in terms of p^n and m. It is also proved that if a finite soluble group G admits an automorphism \psi of order p^aq^b for some primes p,q, then the Fitting height of G is bounded above in terms of |\psi | and |C_G(\psi )|.
