It is well known that every finite subgroup of automorphism group of polynomial algebra of rank 2 over the field of zero characteristic is conjugated with a subgroup of linear automorphisms. We prove that it is not true for an arbitrary torsion subgroup. We construct an example of abelian p-group of automorphism of polynomial algebra of rank 2 over the field of complex numbers, which is not conjugated with a subgroup of linear automorphisms.
