We completely determine upper-modular, codistributive and costandard elements in the lattice of all commutative semigroup varieties. In particular, we prove that the properties of being upper-modular and codistributive elements in the mentioned lattice are equivalent. Moreover, in the nil-case the properties of being elements of all three types turn out to be equivalent.
