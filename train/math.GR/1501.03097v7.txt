We show that, given a finitely generated group G as the coordinate group of a finite system of equations over a torsion-free hyperbolic group \Gamma, there is an algorithm which constructs a cover of a canonical solution diagram. The diagram encodes all homomorphisms from G to \Gamma as compositions of factorizations through \Gamma-NTQ groups and canonical automorphisms of the corresponding NTQ-subgroups. We also give another characterization of \Gamma-limit groups as iterated generalized doubles over \Gamma.
