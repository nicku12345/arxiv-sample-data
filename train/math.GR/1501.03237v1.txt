Let p be a prime such that p \geq 5. Let G be a finite p-solvable group and let p^a be the largest power of p dividing \chi(1) for an irreducible character \chi of G, we show that |G:F(G)|_p \leq p^{5.5a}. Let G be a finite p-solvable group with trivial maximal normal solvable subgroup and we denote |G|_p=p^n, then G contains a block of defect less than or equal to \lfloor \frac {2n} {3} \rfloor.
