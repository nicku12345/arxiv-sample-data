The notion of the holomorph of a generalized Bol loop and generalized flexible-Bol loop are characterized. With the aid of two self-mappings on the holomorph of a loop, it is shown that: the loop is a generalized Bol loop if and only if its holomorph is a generalized Bol loop; the loop is a generalized flexible-Bol loop if and only if its holomorph is a generalized flexible-Bol loop. Furthermore, elements of the Bryant Schneider group of a generalized Bol loop are characterized in terms of pseudo-automorphism, and the automorphisms gotten are used to build the holomorph of the generalized Bol loop.
