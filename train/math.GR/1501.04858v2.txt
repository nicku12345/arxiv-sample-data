A closed subgroup of a semisimple algebraic group is called irreducible if it lies in no proper parabolic subgroup. In this paper we classify all irreducible A_1 subgroups of exceptional algebraic groups G. Consequences are given concerning the representations of such subgroups on various G-modules: for example, the conjugacy classes of irreducible A_1 subgroups are determined by their composition factors on the adjoint module of G.
