Let G be a profinite group in which for every element x\in G there exists a natural number q=q(x) such that x^q is Engel. We show that G is locally virtually nilpotent. Further, let p be a prime and G a finitely generated profinite group in which for every \gamma_k-value x\in G there exists a natural p-power q=q(x) such that x^q is Engel. We show that \gamma_k(G) is locally virtually nilpotent.
