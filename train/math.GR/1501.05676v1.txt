Let G be a finite non-solvable group. We prove that there exists a proper subgroup A of G such that G is the product of three conjugates of A, thus replacing an earlier upper bound of 36 with the smallest possible value. The proof relies on an equivalent formulation in terms of double cosets, and uses the following theorem which is of independent interest and wider scope: Any group G with a BN-pair and a finite Weyl group W satisfies G=\left( Bn_{0}B\right) ^{2}=BB^{n_{0}}B where n_{0} is any preimage of the longest element of W. The proof of the last theorem is formulated in the dioid consisting of all unions of double cosets of B in G. Other results on minimal length product covers of a group by conjugates of a proper subgroup are given.
