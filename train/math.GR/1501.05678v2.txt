We consider factorizations of a finite group G into conjugate subgroups, G=A^{x_{1}}\cdots A^{x_{k}} for A\leq G and x_{1},\ldots ,x_{k}\in G, where A is nilpotent or solvable. First we exploit the split BN-pair structure of finite simple groups of Lie type to give a unified self-contained proof that every such group is a product of four or three unipotent Sylow subgroups. Then we derive an upper bound on the minimal length of a solvable conjugate factorization of a general finite group. Finally, using conjugate factorizations of a general finite solvable group by any of its Carter subgroups, we obtain an upper bound on the minimal length of a nilpotent conjugate factorization of a general finite group.
