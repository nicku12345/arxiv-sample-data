For a compact surface \Sigma (orientable or not, and with boundary or not) we show that the fixed subgroup, \operatorname{Fix} B, of any family B of endomorphisms of \pi_1(\Sigma) is compressed in \pi_1(\Sigma) i.e., \operatorname{rk}((\operatorname{Fix} B)\cap H)\leq \operatorname{rk}(H) for any subgroup \operatorname{Fix} B \leq H \leq \pi_1(\Sigma). On the way, we give a partial positive solution to the inertia conjecture, both for free and for surface groups. We also investigate direct products, G, of finitely many free and surface groups, and give a characterization of when G satisfies that \operatorname{rk}(\operatorname{Fix} \phi) \leq \operatorname{rk}(G) for every \phi \in Aut(G).
