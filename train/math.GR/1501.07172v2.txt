We prove the following: For any \rho\in\left(0,1\right), if a finite group G has an automorphism with a cycle of length at least \rho\cdot|G|, then the index of the solvable radical \operatorname{Rad}(G) in G is bounded from above in terms of \rho, and such a condition is strong enough to imply solvability of G if and only if \rho>\frac{1}{10}. Furthermore, considering, for exponents e\in\left(0,1\right), the condition that a finite group G have an automorphism with a cycle of length at least |G|^e, such a condition is strong enough to imply |\operatorname{Rad}(G)|\to\infty for |G|\to\infty if and only if e>\frac{1}{3}. We also prove similar results for a larger class of bijective self-transformations of finite groups, so-called periodic affine maps.
