Let G be a finitely generated group and let C^* denote the group of all central automorphisms of G fixing the center of G elementwise. Azhdari and Malayeri [J. Algebra Appl., {\bf 6}(2011), 1283-1290] gave necessary and sufficient conditions on G such that C^* \simeq \mathrm{Inn}(G). We prove a technical lemma and, as a consequence, obtain a short and easy proof of this result of Azhdari and Malayeri. Subsequently, we also obtain short proofs of some other existing and some new related results.
