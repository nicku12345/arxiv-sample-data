Let \mathcal{T}_{q+1} be the (q+1)-regular tree and let G be a group of automorphisms acting transitively on the vertices and on the boundary of \mathcal{T}_{q+1}. We give an upper bound for the growth of cocycles with values in any unitary representation of the group G. This bound is optimal by projecting the Haagerup cocycle onto an appropriate subspace of \ell^{2}(E). We also obtain a description of functions conditionally of negative type which are unbounded.
