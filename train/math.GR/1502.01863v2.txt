Let k be a field of characteristic different from 2 and 3. In this paper we study connected simple algebraic groups of type A_2, G_2 and F_4 defined over k, via their rank-2 k-tori. Simple, simply connected groups of type A_2 play a pivotal role in the study of exceptional groups and this aspect is brought out by the results in this paper. We refer to tori, which are maximal tori of A_n type groups, as unitary tori. We discuss conditions necessary for a rank-2 unitary k-torus to embed in simple k-groups of type A_2, G_2 and F_4 in terms of the mod-2 Galois cohomological invariants attached with these groups. We calculate the number of rank-2 k-unitary tori generating these algebraic groups (in fact exhibit such tori explicitly). The results in this paper and our earlier work (Invariants mod-2 and subgroups of G_2 and F_4, J. Alg. 411 (2014) 312- 336) show that the mod-2 invariants of groups of type G_2,F_4 and A_2 are controlled by their k-subgroups of type A_1 and A_2 as well as the unitary k-tori embedded in them.
