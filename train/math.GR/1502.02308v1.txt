We say that a subgroup H of an infinite compact Abelian group X is {\it T-characterized} if there is a T-sequence \mathbf{u} =\{u_n \} in the dual group of X such that H=\{x\in X: \; (u_n, x)\to 1 \}. We show that a closed subgroup H of X is T-characterized if and only if H is a G_\delta-subgroup of X and the annihilator of H admits a Hausdorff minimally almost periodic group topology. All closed subgroups of an infinite compact Abelian group X are T-characterized if and only if X is metrizable and connected. We prove that every compact Abelian group X of infinite exponent has a T-characterized subgroup which is not an F_{\sigma}-subgroup of X that gives a negative answer to Problem 3.3 in [10].
