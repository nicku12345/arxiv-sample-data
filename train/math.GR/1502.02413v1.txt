We prove that for any infinite countable amenable group G, any \epsilon > 0 and any finite subset K\subset G, there exists a tiling (partition of G into finite "tiles" using only finitely many "shapes"), where all the tiles are (K; \epsilon)-invariant. Moreover, our tiling has topological entropy zero (i.e., subexponential complexity of patterns). As an application, we construct a free action of G (in the sense that the mappings, associated to different from unity elements of G, have no fixpoints), on a zero-dimensional space, and which has topological entropy zero.
