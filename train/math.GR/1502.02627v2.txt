We prove that Chevalley group over the field F of zero characteristic possess R_{\infty} property, if F has torsion group of automorphisms or F is an algebraically closed field which has finite transcendence degree over \mathbb{Q}. As a consequence we obtain that the twisted conjugacy class [e]_{\varphi} of unit element is a subgroup of Chevalley group if and only if \varphi is central automorphism.
