Let \pi be a finite p-group and \mathbb{F}_q a finite field with q=p^n elements. Denote by \mathrm{I}_{\mathbb{F}_q} the augmentation ideal of the group ring \mathbb{F}_q[\pi]. We have found a surprising relation between the abelianization of 1+\mathrm{I}_{\mathbb{F}_q}, the Bogomolov multiplier \mathrm{B}_0(\pi) of \pi and the number of conjugacy classes \mathrm{k}(\pi) of \pi: \[ | (1+\mathrm{I}_{\mathbb{F}_q})_{\mathrm{ab}} |=q^{\mathrm{k}(\pi)-1}|\mathrm{B}_0(\pi)|. \] In particular, if \pi is a finite p-group with a non-trivial Bogomolov multiplier, then 1+\mathrm{I}_{\mathbb{F}_q} is a counterexample to the fake degree conjecture proposed by M. Isaacs.
