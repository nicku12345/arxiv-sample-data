In this paper, we give a necessary and sufficient condition for an essential simple loop on a 2-bridge sphere in an even Heckoid orbifold for the trivial knot to be null-homotopic, peripheral or torsion in the orbifold. We also give a necessary and sufficient condition for two essential simple loops on a 2-bridge sphere in an even Heckoid orbifold for the trivial knot to be homotopic in the orbifold.
