This paper provides some properties of Brauer symmetry classes of tensors. We derive a dimension formula for the orbital subspaces in the Brauer symmetry classes of tensors corresponding to the irreducible Brauer characters of the groups having cyclic groups support on non-linear Brauer characters. Using the derived formula, we investigate the necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of the o-basis of Dicyclic groups, Semi-dihedral groups and also reinvestigate those things on Dihedral groups. Some criteria for the non-vanishing elements in the Brauer symmetry classes of tensors associated to those groups are also included.
