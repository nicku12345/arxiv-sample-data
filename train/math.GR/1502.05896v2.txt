In a step towards the classification of endotrivial modules for quasi-simple groups, we investigate endotrivial modules for the sporadic simple groups and their covers. A main outcome of our study is the existence of torsion endotrivial modules with dimension greater than one for several sporadic groups with p-rank greater than one.
