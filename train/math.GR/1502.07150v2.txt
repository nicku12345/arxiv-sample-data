Diagram semigroups are interesting algebraic and combinatorial objects, several types of them originating from questions in computer science and in physics. Here we describe diagram semigroups in a general framework and extend our computational knowledge of them. The generated data set is replete with surprising observations raising many open questions for further theoretical research.
