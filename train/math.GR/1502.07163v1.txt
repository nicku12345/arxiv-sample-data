Let G be a finite permutation group on a finite set \Omega. The notion of G being quasi-transitive on \Omega was defined by Alan Camina \cite{Camina}; in that paper conditions were established that ensured a quasi-transitive group on a finite set \Omega was transitive on \Omega. The aim of this paper is to validate the conjecture made in \cite{Camina}: given any group G, if G is quasi-transitive on a finite set \Omega then G is transitive on \Omega.
