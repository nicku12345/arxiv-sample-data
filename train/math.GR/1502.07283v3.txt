Let G be a finitely generated regular branch group acting by automorphisms on a regular rooted tree T. It is well-known that stabilizers of infinite rays in T (aka parabolic subgroups) are weakly maximal subgroups in G, that is, maximal among subgroups of infinite index. We show that, given a finite subgroup Q\leq G, G possesses uncountably many automorphism equivalence classes of weakly maximal subgroups containing Q. In particular, for Grigorchuk-Gupta-Sidki type groups this implies that they have uncountably many automorphism equivalence classes of weakly maximal subgroups that are not parabolic.
