The article [14] gives a list of 51 symplectic hypergeometric monodromy groups corresponding to primitive pairs of degree four polynomials, which are products of cyclotomic polynomials, and for which, the absolute value of the leading coefficient of the difference polynomial is greater than 2.   It follows from [12] and [14] that 12 of the 51 monodromy groups are arithmetic (cf. Table 1); and the thinness of 13 of the remaining 39 monodromy groups follows from [3] (cf. Table 2).   In this article, we show that 15 of the remaining 26 monodromy groups are arithmetic (cf. Table 3).
