We prove several results detecting ciclicity or nilpotency of a finite group G in terms of inequalities involving the orders of the elements of G and the orders of the elements of the cyclic group of order |G|. We prove that, among the groups of the same order, the number of cyclic subgroups is minimal for the cyclic group and the product of the orders of the elements is maximal for the cyclic group.
