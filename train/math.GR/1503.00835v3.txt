An Orlicz space L^{\Phi}(\Omega) is a Banach function space defined by using a Young function \Phi, which generalizes the L^p spaces. We show that, for a reflexive Orlicz space L^{\Phi}([0,1]), a locally compact second countable group has Kazhdan's property (T) if and only if it has property (T_{L^{\Phi}([0,1])}), which is a generalization of Kazhdan's property (T) for linear isometric representations on L^{\Phi}([0,1]). We also prove that, for a Banach space B whose modulus of convexity is sufficiently large, if a locally compact second countable group has Kazhdan's property (T), then it has property (F_{B}), which is a fixed point property for affine isometric actions on B. Moreover, we see that, for an Orlicz sequence space \ell^{\Phi\Psi} such that the Young function \Psi sufficiently rapidly increases near 0, hyperbolic groups (with Kazhdan's property (T)) don't have property (F_{\ell^{\Phi\Psi}}). These results are generalizations of the results for L^p-spaces.
