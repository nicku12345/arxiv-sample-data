The complexity of a module is an important homological invariant that measures the polynomial rate of growth of its minimal projective resolution. For the symmetric group \Sigma_n, the Lie module \mathsf{Lie}(n) has attracted a great deal of interest in recent years. We prove here that the complexity of \mathsf{Lie}(n) in characteristic p is t where p^t is the largest power of p dividing n, thus proving a conjecture of Erdmann, Lim and Tan. The proof uses work of Arone and Kankaanrinta which describes the homology \operatorname{H}_\bullet(\Sigma_n, \mathsf{Lie}(n)) and earlier work of Hemmer and Nakano on complexity for modules over \Sigma_n that involves restriction to Young subgroups.
