Inspired by work surrounding Igusa's local zeta function, we introduce topological representation zeta functions of unipotent algebraic groups over number fields. These group-theoretic invariants capture common features of established p-adic representation zeta functions associated with pro-p groups derived from unipotent groups. We investigate fundamental properties of the topological zeta functions considered here. We also develop a method for computing them under non-degeneracy assumptions. As an application, among other things, we obtain a complete classification of topological representation zeta functions of unipotent algebraic groups of dimension at most six.
