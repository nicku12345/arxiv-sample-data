Rational discrete cohomology and homology for a totally disconnected locally compact group G is introduced and studied. The \mathrm{Hom}-\otimes identities associated to the rational discrete bimodule \mathrm{Bi}(G) allow to introduce the notion of rational duality groups in analogy to the discrete case. It is shown that semi-simple groups defined over a non-discrete, non-archimedean local field are rational t.d.l.c. duality groups, and the same is true for certain topological Kac-Moody groups. However, Y. Neretin's group of spheromorphisms of a locally finite regular tree is not even of finite rational discrete cohomological dimension. For a unimodular t.d.l.c. group G of type \mathrm{FP} it is possible to define an Euler-Poincar\'e characteristic \chi(G) which is a rational multiple of a Haar measure. This value is calculated explicitly for Chevalley groups defined over a non-discrete, non-archimedean local field K and some other examples.
