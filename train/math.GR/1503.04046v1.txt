We prove that for every \epsilon > 0 there exists a \delta > 0 so that every group of order n \geq 3 has at least \delta \log_{2} n/{(\log_{2} \log_{2} n)}^{3+\epsilon} conjugacy classes. This sharpens earlier results of Pyber and Keller. Bertram speculates whether it is true that every finite group of order n has more than \log_{3}n conjugacy classes. We answer Bertram's question in the affirmative for groups with a trivial solvable radical.
