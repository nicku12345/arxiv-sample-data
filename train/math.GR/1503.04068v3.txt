We introduce a refined version of group cohomology and relate it to the space of polynomials on the group in question. We show that the polynomial cohomology with trivial coefficients admits a description in terms of ordinary cohomology with polynomial coefficients, and that the degree one polynomial cohomology with trivial coefficients admits a description directly in terms of polynomials. Lastly, we give a complete description of the polynomials on a connected, simply connected nilpotent Lie group by showing that these are exactly the maps that pull back to classical polynomials via the exponential map.
