The excess of an element w of a finite Coxeter group W is the minimal value of l(x) + l(y) - l(w), where x, y are elements of W such that x^2 = y^2 = 1 and w = xy. Every element of a finite Coxeter group is either an involution or the product of two involutions, so the concept of excess is well defined. It can be extended to strongly real classes of infinite Coxeter groups. Earlier work by the authors showed that every conjugacy class of a finite Coxeter group contains an element of minimal length and excess zero. The current paper shows that each conjugacy class also contains an element of maximal length and excess zero.
