Let m\geq 3 be a positive integer. We prove that there are uncountably many non-commensurable metabelian uniform pro-p groups of dimension m. Consequently, there are uncountably many non-commensurable finitely presented pro-p groups with minimal number of generators m (and minimal number of relations  {m \choose 2}).
