Let \Gamma(G) be the prime graph associated with a finite group G and D(G) be the degree pattern of G. A finite group G is said to be k-fold OD-characterizable if there exist exactly k non-isomorphic groups H such that |H|=|G| and D(H)=D(G). The purpose of this article is twofold. First, it shows that the symmetric group S_{27} is 38-fold OD-charaterizable. Second, it shows that there exist many infinite families of alternating and symmetric groups, \{A_n\} and \{S_n\}, which are k-fold OD-characterizable with k>3.
