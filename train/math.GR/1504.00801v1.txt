Let G be a group. \textit{The permutability graph of cyclic subgroups of G}, denoted by \Gamma_c(G), is a graph with all the proper cyclic subgroups of G as its vertices and two distinct vertices in \Gamma_c(G) are adjacent if and only if the corresponding subgroups permute in G. In this paper, we classify the finite groups whose permutability graph of cyclic subgroups belongs to one of the following: bipartite, tree, star graph, triangle-free, complete bipartite, P_n, C_n, K_4, K_{1,3}-free, unicyclic. We classify abelian groups whose permutability graph of cyclic subgroups are planar. Also we investigate the connectedness, diameter, girth, totally disconnectedness, completeness and regularity of these graphs.
