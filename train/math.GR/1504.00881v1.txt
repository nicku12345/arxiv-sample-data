Let G be a finite group such that \text{SL}(n,q)\subseteq G \subseteq \text{GL}(n,q) and Z be a central subgroup of G. In this paper we determine the group T(G/Z) consisting of the equivalence classes of endotrivial k(G/Z)-modules where k is an algebraically closed field of characteristic p such that p does not divide q. The results in this paper complete the classification of endotrivial modules for all finite groups of Lie Type A, initiated earlier by the authors.
