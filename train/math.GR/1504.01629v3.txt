Let \Omega be a set of cardinality n, G a permutation group on \Omega, and f:\Omega\to\Omega a map which is not a permutation. We say that G \emph{synchronizes} f if the transformation semigroup \langle G,f\rangle contains a constant map, and that G is a \emph{synchronizing group} if G synchronizes \emph{every} non-permutation.   A synchronizing group is necessarily primitive, but there are primitive groups that are not synchronizing. Every non-synchronizing primitive group fails to synchronize at least one uniform transformation (that is, transformation whose kernel has parts of equal size), and it has previously been conjectured that a primitive group synchronizes every non-uniform transformation.   The first goal of this paper is to prove that this conjecture is false, by exhibiting primitive groups that fail to synchronize specific non-uniform transformations of ranks 5 and 6. In addition we produce graphs whose automorphism groups have approximately \sqrt{n} \emph{non-synchronizing ranks}, thus refuting another conjecture on the number of non-synchronizing ranks of a primitive group.   The second goal of this paper is to extend the spectrum of ranks for which it is known that primitive groups synchronize every non-uniform transformation of that rank. It has previously been shown that a primitive group of degree n synchronizes every non-uniform transformation of rank n-1 and n-2, and here this is extended to n-3 and n-4.   Determining the exact spectrum of ranks for which there exist non-uniform transformations not synchronized by some primitive group is just one of several natural, but possibly difficult, problems on automata, primitive groups, graphs and computational algebra arising from this work; these are outlined in the final section.
