We construct groups G that are virtually torsion-free and have virtual cohomological dimension strictly less than the minimal dimension for any model for the classifying space for proper actions of G. They are the first examples that have these properties and also admit cocompact models for this classifying space. We exhibit groups G whose virtual cohomological dimension and Bredon cohomological dimension are two that do not admit any 2-dimensional contractible proper G-CW-complex.
