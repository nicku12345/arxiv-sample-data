Let {\cal C} be a nonempty class of finite groups closed under taking subgroups, homomorphic images and extensions. A subgroup H of an abstract residually {\cal C} group R is said to be conjugacy {\cal C}-distinguished if whenever y\in R, then y has a conjugate in H if and only if the same holds for the images of y and H in every quotient group R/N\in {\cal C} of R. We prove that in a group having a normal free subgroup \Phi such that R/\Phi is in {\cal C}, every finitely generated subgroup is conjugacy {\cal C}-distinguished. We also prove that finitely generated subgroups of limit groups, of Lyndon groups and certain one-relator groups are conjugacy distinguished ({\cal C} here is the class of all finite groups).
