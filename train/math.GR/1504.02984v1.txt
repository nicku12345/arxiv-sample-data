Let H be a subgroup of a group G. A normal subgroup N_H of H is said to be inheritably normal if there is a normal subgroup N_G of G such that N_H=N_G\cap H. It is proved in the paper that a subgroup N_{G_i} of a factor G_i of the n-periodic product \prod_{i\in I}^nG_i with nontrivial factors G_i is an inheritably normal subgroup if and only if N_{G_i} contains the subgroup G_i^n. It is also proved that for odd n\ge 665 every nontrivial normal subgroup in a given n-periodic product G=\prod_{i\in I}^nG_i contains the subgroup G^n. It follows that almost all n-periodic products G=G_1\overset{n}{\ast}G_2 are Hopfian, i.e., they are not isomorphic to any of their proper quotient groups. This allows one to construct nonsimple and not residually finite Hopfian groups of bounded exponents.
