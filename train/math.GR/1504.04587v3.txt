Automorphisms of order 2 are studied in order to understand generalized symmetric spaces. The groups of type E_6 we consider here can be realized as both the group of linear maps that leave a certain determinant invariant, and also as the identity component of the automorphism group of a class of structurable algebras known as Brown algebras. We will classify the k-involutions of these groups of type E_6 using aspects of both descriptions, and give detailed descriptions of representatives over certain fields including algebraically closed fields, \mathbb{R}, \mathbb{F}_p, and \mathbb{Q}_p.
