A subgroup H of a finite group G is called submodular in G, if we can connect H with G by a chain of subgroups, each of which is modular (in the sense of Kurosh) in the next. If a group G is supersoluble and every Sylow subgroup of G is submodular in G, then G is called strongly supersoluble. The properties of groups with submodular Sylow subgroups are obtained. In particular, we proved that in a group every Sylow subgroup is submodular if and only if the group is Ore dispersive and every its biprimary subgroup is strongly supersoluble.
