Bounded-cohomological dimension of groups is a relative of classical cohomological dimension, defined in terms of bounded cohomology with trivial coefficients instead of ordinary group cohomology. We will discuss constructions that lead to groups with infinite bounded-cohomological dimension, and we will provide new examples of groups with bounded-cohomological dimension equal to 0. In particular, we will prove that every group functorially embeds into an acyclic group with trivial bounded cohomology.
