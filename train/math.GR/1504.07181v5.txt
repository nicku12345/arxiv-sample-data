In his paper "On a construction of semigroups", M. Kolibiar gives a construction for a semigroup T (beginning from a semigroup S) which is said to be derived from the semigroup S by a \theta-construction. He asserted that every semigroup T can be derived from the factor semigroup T/\theta (T) by a \theta-construction, where \theta (T) is the congruence on T defined by: (a, b)\in \theta (T) if and only if xa=xb for all x\in T. Unfortunately, the paper contains some incorrect part. In our present paper we give a revision of the paper.
