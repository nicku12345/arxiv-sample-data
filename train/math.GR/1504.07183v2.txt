In this paper we characterize and construct semigroups whose right regular representation is a left cancellative semigroup. These semigroups will be called left equalizer simple semigroups. For a congruence \varrho on a semigroup S, let {\mathbb F}[\varrho] denote the ideal of the semigroup algebra {\mathbb F}[S] which determines the kernel of the extended homomorphism of {\mathbb F}[S] onto {\mathbb F}[S/\varrho] induced by the canonical homomorphism of S onto S/\varrho. We examine the right colons ({\mathbb F}[\varrho]:_r{\mathbb F}[S])=\{ a\in {\mathbb F}[S]:\ {\mathbb F}[S]a\subseteq {\mathbb F}[\varrho ]\} in general, and in that special case when \varrho has the property that the factor semigroup S/\varrho is left equalizer simple.
