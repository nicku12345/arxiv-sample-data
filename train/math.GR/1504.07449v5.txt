We study the (virtual) indicability of the automorphism group Aut(A_\Gamma) of the right-angled Artin group A_\Gamma associated to a simplicial graph \Gamma. First, we identify two conditions -- denoted (B1) and (B2) -- on \Gamma which together imply that H^1(G, Z)=0 for certain finite-index subgroups G<Aut(A_\Gamma). On the other hand we will show that (B2) is equivalent to the matrix group {\mathcal H} = {\rm Im}(Aut(A_\Gamma) \to Aut(H_1(A_\Gamma))) <GL(n,Z) not being virtually indicable, and also to \mathcal H having Kazhdan's property (T). As a consequence, Aut(A_\Gamma) virtually surjects onto Z whenever \Gamma does not satisfy (B2). In addition, we give an extra property of \Gamma ensuring that Aut(A_\Gamma) and Out(A_\Gamma) virtually surject onto Z. Finally, in the appendix we offer some remarks on the linearity problem for Aut(A_\Gamma).
