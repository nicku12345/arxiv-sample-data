We identify the representations \mathbb{K}[X^k, X^{k-1}Y, \dots, Y^k] among abstract \mathbb{Z}[\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{K})]-modules. One result is on \mathbb{Q}[\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{Z})]-modules of short nilpotence length and generalises a classical "quadratic" theorem by Smith and Timmesfeld. Another one is on extending the linear structure on the module from the prime field to \mathbb{K}. All proofs are by computation in the group ring using the Steinberg relations.
