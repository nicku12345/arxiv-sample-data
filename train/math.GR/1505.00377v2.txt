Let G be a simple algebraic group of type G_2 over an algebraically closed field of characteristic 2. We give an example of a finite group \Gamma with Sylow 2-subgroup \Gamma_2 and an infinite family of pairwise non-conjugate homomorphisms \rho\colon \Gamma\rightarrow G whose restrictions to \Gamma_2 are all conjugate. This answers a question of Burkhard K\"ulshammer from 1995. We also give an action of \Gamma on a connected unipotent group V such that the map of 1-cohomologies {\rm H}^1(\Gamma,V)\rightarrow {\rm H}^1(\Gamma_p,V) induced by restriction of 1-cocycles has an infinite fibre.
