We prove surjectivity of certain word maps on finite non-abelian simple groups. More precisely, we prove the following: if N is a product of two prime powers, then the word map sending (x,y) to the product of the Nth powers of x and y is surjective on every finite non-abelian simple group; If is an odd integer, then the word map sending the triple (x,y,z) to the product of the Nth powers is surjective on every finite quasisimple group. These generalize classical theorems of Burnside and Feit-Thompson. We also prove asymptotic results about the surjectivity of the word map sending (x,y) to the product of the Nth powers of x and y that depend on the number of prime factors of the integer N.
