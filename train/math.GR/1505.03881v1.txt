If f(p, n) is the number of pairwise nonisomorphic groups of order p^n, and g(p,n) is the number of groups of order p^n whose automorphism group is a p-group, then, for n \leq 7, we prove that the ratio g(p,n)/f (p,n) is bounded away from 1 as the prime p grows to infinity. In addition, we provide some data on the number of groups whose automorphism group is a group of prime power order, for primes no larger than 11.
