Let m,n be positive integers. Suppose that G is a residually finite group in which for every element x \in G there exists a positive integer q=q(x) \leqslant m such that x^q is n-Engel. We show that G is locally virtually nilpotent. Further, let w be a multilinear commutator and G a residually finite group in which for every product of at most 896 w-values x there exists a positive integer q=q(x) dividing m such that x^q is n-Engel. Then w(G) is locally virtually nilpotent.
