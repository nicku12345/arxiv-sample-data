We say a permutation \pi=\pi_1\pi_2\cdots\pi_n in the symmetric group \mathfrak{S}_n has a peak at index i if \pi_{i-1}<\pi_i>\pi_{i+1} and we let P(\pi)=\{i \in \{1, 2, \ldots, n\} \, \vert \, \mbox{i is a peak of \pi}\}. Given a set S of positive integers, we let P (S; n) denote the subset of \mathfrak{S}_n consisting of all permutations \pi, where P(\pi) =S. In 2013, Billey, Burdzy, and Sagan proved |P(S;n)| = p(n)2^{n-\lvert S\rvert-1}, where p(n) is a polynomial of degree \max(S)- 1. In 2014, Castro-Velez et al. considered the Coxeter group of type B_n as the group of signed permutations on n letters and showed that \lvert P_B(S;n)\rvert=p(n)2^{2n-|S|-1} where p(n) is the same polynomial of degree \max(S)-1. In this paper we partition the sets P(S;n) \subset \mathfrak{S}_n studied by Billey, Burdzy, and Sagan into subsets of P(S;n) of permutations with peak set S that end with an ascent to a fixed integer k or a descent and provide polynomial formulas for the cardinalities of these subsets. After embedding the Coxeter groups of Lie type C_n and D_n into \mathfrak{S}_{2n}, we partition these groups into bundles of permutations \pi_1\pi_2 \cdots\pi_n|\pi_{n+1}\cdots \pi_{2n} such that \pi_1\pi_2\cdots \pi_n has the same relative order as some permutation \sigma_1\sigma_2\cdots\sigma_n \in \mathfrak{S}_n. This allows us to count the number of permutations in types C_n and D_n with a given peak set S by reducing the enumeration to calculations in the symmetric group and sums across the rows of Pascal's triangle.
