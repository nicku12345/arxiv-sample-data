Let G = H\times A be a group, where H is a purely non-abelian subgroup of G and A is a non-trivial abelian factor of G. Then, for n \geq 2, we show that there exists an isomorphism \phi : Aut_{Z(G)}^{\gamma_{n}(G)}(G) \rightarrow Aut_{Z(H)}^{\gamma_{n}(H)}(H) such that \phi(Aut_{c}^{n-1}(G))=Aut_{c}^{n-1}(H). Also, for a finite non-abelian p-group G satisfying a certain natural hypothesis, we give some necessary and sufficient conditions for Autcent(G) = Aut_c^{n-1}(G). Furthermore, for a finite non-abelian p-group G we study the equality of Autcent(G) with Aut_{Z(G)}^{\gamma_{n}(G)}(G).
