Let A be a nilpotent p-group of finite exponent, and B be an abelian p-groups of finite exponent. Then the wreath product A {\rm Wr} B generates the variety {\rm var}(A) {\rm var}(B) if and only if the group B contains a subgroup isomorphic to the direct product C_{p^v}^\infty of at least countably many copies of the cyclic group C_{p^v} of order p^v = \exp{(B)}. The obtained theorem continues our previous study of cases when {\rm var}(A {\rm Wr} B ) = {\rm var}(A){\rm var}(B) holds for some other classes of groups A and B (abelian groups, finite groups, etc.).
