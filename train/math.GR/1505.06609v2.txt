We present an overview of the theory of self-distributive quasigroups, both in the two-sided and one-sided cases, and relate the older results to the modern theory of quandles, to which self-distributive quasigroups are a special case. Most attention is paid to the representation results (loop isotopy, linear representation, homogeneous representation), as the main tool to investigate self-distributive quasigroups.
