We show that if a group G has a finite normal subgroup L such that G/L is hypercentral, then the index of the hypercenter of G is bounded by a function of the order of L. This completes recent results generalizing classical theorems by R. Baer and P. Hall. Then we apply our results to groups of automorphisms of a group G acting in a restricted way on an ascending normal series of G.
