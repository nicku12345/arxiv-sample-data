It is well known that when G is the fundamental group of a closed surface of negative Euler characteristic, it has the R_{\infty} property. In this work we compute the least integer c, {\it called the R_{\infty}-nilpotency degree of G}, such that the group G/ \gamma_{c+1}(G) has the R_{\infty} property, where \gamma_r(G) is the r-th term of the lower central series of G. We show that c=4 for G the fundamental group of any orientable closed surface S_g of genus g>1. For the fundamental group of the non-orientable surface N_g (the connected sum of g projective planes) this number is 2(g-1) (when g>2). A similar concept is introduced using the derived series G^{(r)} of a group G. Namely {\it the R_{\infty}-solvability degree of G}, which is the least integer c such that the group G/G^{(c)} has the R_{\infty} property. We show that the fundamental group of an orientable closed surface S_g has R_{\infty}-solvability degree 2.
