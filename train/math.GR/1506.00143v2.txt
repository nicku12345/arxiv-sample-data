Let \mathcal{S} be a sequence of finite perfect transitive permutation groups with uniformly bounded number of generators. We prove that the infinitely iterated wreath product in product action of the groups in \mathcal{S} is topologically finitely generated, provided that the actions of the groups in \mathcal{S} are not regular. We prove that our bound has the right asymptotic behaviour. We also deduce that other infinitely iterated mixed wreath products of groups in \mathcal{S} are finitely generated. Finally we apply our methods to find explicitly two generators of infinitely iterated wreath products in product action of special sequences \mathcal{S}.
