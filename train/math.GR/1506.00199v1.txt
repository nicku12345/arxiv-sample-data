For any group G, we define an equivalence relation \thicksim as below: \forall \ g, h \in G \ \ g\thicksim h \Longleftrightarrow |g|=|h| the set of sizes of equivalence classes with respect to this relation is called the same-order type of G and denote by \alpha{(G)}. In this paper, we give a partial answer to a conjecture raised by Shen. In fact, we show that if G is a nilpotent group, then |\pi(G)|\leq |\alpha{(G)}|, where \pi(G) is the set of prime divisors of order of G. Also we investigate the groups all of whoseproper subgroups, say H have |\alpha{(H)}|\leq 2.
