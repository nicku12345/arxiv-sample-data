We study random nilpotent groups in the well-established style of random groups, by choosing relators uniformly among freely reduced words of (nearly) equal length and letting the length tend to infinity. Whereas random groups are quotients of a free group by such a random set of relators, random nilpotent groups are formed as corresponding quotients of a free nilpotent group. This model reveals new phenomena because nilpotent groups are not "visible" in the standard model of random groups (due to the sharp phase transition from infinite hyperbolic to trivial groups).
