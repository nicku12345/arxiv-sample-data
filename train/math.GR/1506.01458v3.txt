Linking systems are crucial for studying the homotopy theory of fusion systems, but are also of interest from an algebraic point of view. We propose a definition of a linking system associated to a saturated fusion system which is more general than the one currently in the literature and thus allows a more flexible choice of objects of linking systems. More precisely, we define subcentric subgroups of fusion systems in a way that every quasicentric subgroup of a saturated fusion system is subcentric. Whereas the objects of linking systems in the current definition are always quasicentric, the objects of our linking systems only need to be subcentric. We prove that, associated to each saturated fusion system \mathcal{F}, there is a unique linking system whose objects are the subcentric subgroups of \mathcal{F}. Furthermore, the nerve of such a subcentric linking system is homotopy equivalent to the nerve of the centric linking system associated to \mathcal{F}. We believe that the existence of subcentric linking systems opens a new way for a classification of fusion systems of characteristic p-type. The various results we prove about subcentric subgroups give furthermore some evidence that the concept is of interest for studying extensions of linking systems and fusion systems.
