A metacyclic group H can be presented as \langle \alpha,\beta\mid \alpha^{n}=1, \ \beta^{m}=\alpha^{t}, \ \beta\alpha\beta^{-1}=\alpha^{r}\rangle for some n,m,t,r. Each endomorphism \sigma of H is determined by   \sigma(\alpha)=\alpha^{x_{1}}\beta^{y_{1}}, \sigma(\beta)=\alpha^{x_{2}}\beta^{y_{2}} for some integers x_{1},x_{2},y_{1},y_{2}. We give sufficient and necessary conditions on x_{1},x_{2},y_{1},y_{2} for \sigma to be an automorphism.
