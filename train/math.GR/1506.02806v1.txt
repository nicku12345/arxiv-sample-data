In this paper we study embeddings of unitriangular groups UT_n(\mathbb{F}_p) arising under adjunction of roots. We construct embeddings of UT_n(\mathbb{F}_p) in UT_m(\mathbb{F}_p), for n \geq 2, m=(n-1)p^s + 1, s \in \mathbb{Z}^+, such that any element of UT_n(\mathbb{F}_p) has a p^s-th root in UT_m(\mathbb{F}_p). Also we construct an embedding of the wreath product UT_n(\mathbb{F}_p) \wr C_{p^s} in UT_m(\mathbb{F}_p), where C_{p^s} is the cyclic group of order p^s.
