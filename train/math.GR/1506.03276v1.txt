An equation over a group with one unknown is called regular if the exponent sum of the unknown is nonzero. In this paper we prove that some regular equations of exponent rp^s, where r \in \mathbb{Z}, s \in \mathbb{N}, \gcd(r,p)=1, over the group UT_n(\mathbb{F}_p) (n \geq 2) are solvable in an overgroup isomorphic to UT_{(n-1)p^s + 1}(\mathbb{F}_p). Applying this for n=3 we prove that any regular equation of exponent rp^s over the Heisenberg p-group UT_3(\mathbb{F}_p) is solvable in an overgroup isomorphic to UT_{2p^s + 1}(\mathbb{F}_p). The proofs of these results are constructive and allow to obtain solutions of equations in explicit form.
