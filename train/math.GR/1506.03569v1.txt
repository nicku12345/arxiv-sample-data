We prove that for any prime p\geq 3 the minimal exponential growth rate of the Baumslag-Solitar group BS(1,p) and the lamplighter group \mathcal{L}_p=(\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z})\wr \mathbb{Z} are equal. We also show that for p=2 this claim is not true and the growth rate of BS(1,2) is equal to the positive root of x^3-x^2-2, whilst the one of the lamplighter group \mathcal{L}_2 is equal to the golden ratio (1+\sqrt5)/2. The latter value also serves to show that the lower bound of A.Mann from [Mann, Journal of Algebra 326, no. 1 (2011) 208--217] for the growth rates of non-semidirect HNN extensions is optimal.
