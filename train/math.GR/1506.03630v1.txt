The spectrum of a finite group is the set of its element orders, and two groups are said to be isospectral if they have the same spectra. A finite group G is said to be recognizable by spectrum, if every finite group isospectral with G is isomorphic to G. We prove that if S is any of the sporadic simple groups M^cL, M_{12}, M_{22}, He, Suz, O'N, then {\rm Aut}(S) is recognizable by spectrum. This finishes the proof of the recognizability by spectrum of the automorphism groups of all sporadic simple groups, except J_2. Furthermore, we show that if G is isospectral with {\rm Aut}(J_2), then either G is isomorphic to {\rm Aut}(J_2), or G is an extension of a 2-group by \mathbb{A}_8.
