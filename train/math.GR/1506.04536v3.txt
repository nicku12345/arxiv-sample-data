For any surface \Sigma of genus g \geq 1 and (essentially) any collection of positive integers i_1, i_2, \ldots, i_\ell with i_1+\cdots +i_\ell = 4g-4 Masur and Smillie have shown that there exists a pseudo-Anosov homeomorphism h:\Sigma \to \Sigma with precisely \ell singularities S_1, \ldots, S_\ell in its stable foliation \cal L, such that \cal L has precisely i_k+2 separatrices raying out from each S_k.   In this paper we prove the analogue of this result for automorphisms of a free group F_N, where "pseudo-Anosov homeomorphism" is replaced by "fully irreducible automorphism" and the Gauss-Bonnet equality i_1+\cdots +i_\ell = 4g-4 is replaced by the index inequality i_1+\cdots +i_\ell \leq 2N-2 from Gaboriau, Jaeger, Levitt and Lustig.
