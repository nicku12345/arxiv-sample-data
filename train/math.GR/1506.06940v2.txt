We give new characterizations of sofic groups:   -- A group G is sofic if and only if it is a subgroup of a quotient of a direct product of alternating or symmetric groups.   -- A group G is sofic if and only if any system of equations solvable in all alternating groups is solvable over G.   The last characterization allows to express soficity of an existentially closed group by \forall\exists-sentences.   Keywords: sofic groups, approximations, equations over groups.
