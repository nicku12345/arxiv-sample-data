In this paper a new equivalence relation \approx to classify the fuzzy subgroups of finite groups is introduced and studied. This generalizes the equivalence relation \sim defined on the lattice of fuzzy subgroups of a finite group that has been used in our previous papers (see e.g. \cite{16,24}). Explicit formulas for the number of distinct fuzzy subgroups with respect to \approx are obtained in some particular cases.
