We show a simple geometric procedure for an extension of a loop realized as the image \Sigma ^{\ast} of a sharply transitive section in a subgroup G^{\ast} of the projective linear group PGL(n-1, \mathbb K) to a loop realized as the image of a sharply transitive section in a group \Delta =T' \rtimes C of affinities of the n-dimensional space {\cal A}_n=\mathbb K^n over a commutative field \mathbb K. We desire that T' is a large subgroup of affine translations and that \alpha (C)=G^{\ast} holds for the canonical homomorphism \alpha :GL(n,\mathbb K) \to PGL(n, \mathbb K). We demonstrate that our construction successfully can be applied to sharply transitive sections in unitary and orthogonal groups SU_{p_2}(n,F) of positive index p_2 over ordered pythagorean n-real fields F.
