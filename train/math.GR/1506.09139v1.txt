We classify the connected 3-dimensional differentiable Bol loops L having a solvable Lie group as the group topologically generated by the left translations of L using 3-dimensional solvable Lie triple systems. Together with \cite{figula} our results complete the classification of all 3-dimensional differentiable Bol loops.
