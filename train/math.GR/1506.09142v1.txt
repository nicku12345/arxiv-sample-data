We construct loops which are semidirect products of groups of affinities. As their elements in many cases one may take transversal subspaces of an affine space. In particular we obtain in this manner smooth loops having Lie groups of affine real transformations as the groups generated by left translations, whereas the groups generated by right translations are smooth groups of infinite dimension. We also determine the Akivis algebras of these loops.
