We clarify the structure of nilpotent Lie groups which are multiplication groups of 3-dimensional simply connected topological loops and prove that non-solvable Lie groups acting minimally on 3-dimensional manifolds cannot be the multiplication group of 3-dimensional topological loops. Among the nilpotent Lie groups for any filiform groups {\mathcal F}_{n+2} and {\mathcal F}_{m+2} with n, m > 1, the direct product {\mathcal F}_{n+2} \times \mathbb R and the direct product {\mathcal F}_{n+2} \times _Z {\mathcal F}_{m+2} with amalgamated center Z occur as the multiplication group of 3-dimensional topological loops. To obtain this result we classify all 3-dimensional simply connected topological loops having a 4-dimensional nilpotent Lie group as the group topologically generated by the left translations.
