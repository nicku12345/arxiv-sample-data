We prove that if the multiplication group Mult(L) of a connected 2-dimensional topological loop is a Lie group, then Mult(L) is an elementary filiform nilpotent Lie group of dimension at least 4. Moreover, we describe loops having elementary filiform Lie groups \mathbb F as the group topologically generated by their left translations and obtain a complete classification for these loops L if \hbox{dim} \ \mathbb F=3. In this case necessary and sufficient conditions for L are given that Mult(L) is an elementary filiform Lie group for a given allowed dimension.
