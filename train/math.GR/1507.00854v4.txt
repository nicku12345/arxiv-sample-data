We improve on recent estimates for the probability of generating the alternating and symmetric groups \mathrm{Alt}(n) and \mathrm{Sym}(n). In particular we find the sharp lower bound, if the probability is given by a quadratic in n^{-1}. This leads to improved bounds on the largest number h(\mathrm{Alt}(n)) such that a direct product of h(\mathrm{Alt}(n)) copies of \mathrm{Alt}(n) can be generated by two elements.
