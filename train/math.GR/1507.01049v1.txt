We study (G,2)-arc-transitive graphs for innately transitive permutation groups G such that G can be embedded into a wreath product \sym\Gamma\wr\sy\ell acting in product action on \Gamma^\ell. We find two such connected graphs: the first is Sylvester's double six graph with 36 vertices, while the second is a graph with 120^2 vertices whose automorphism group is \aut\sp 44. We prove that under certain conditions no more such graphs exist.
