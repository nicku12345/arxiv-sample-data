We prove that each 3-dimensional connected topological loop L having a solvable Lie group of dimension \le 5 as the multiplication group of L is centrally nilpotent of class 2. Moreover, we classify the solvable non-nilpotent Lie groups G which are multiplication groups for 3-dimensional simply connected topological loops L and \hbox{dim} \ G \le 5. These groups are direct products of proper connected Lie groups and have dimension 5. We find also the inner mapping groups of L.
