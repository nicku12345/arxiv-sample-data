Let W^c(\tilde A_{n}) be the set of fully commutative elements in the affine Coxeter group W(\tilde A_{n}) of type \tilde{A}. We classify the elements of W^c(\tilde A_{n}) and give a normal form for its elements. We give a first application of this normal form to fully commutative affine braids. We then use this normal form to define two injections from W^c(\tilde A_{n-1}) into W^c(\tilde A_{n}) and examine their properties. We then consider the tower of affine Temperley-Lieb algebras of type \tilde{A } and use the injections above to prove the injectivity of this tower.
