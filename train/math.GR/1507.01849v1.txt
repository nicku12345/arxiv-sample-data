For every free product decomposition G = G_{1} \ast ...\ast G_{q} \ast F_{r} of a group of finite Kurosh rank G, where F_r is a finitely generated free group, we can associate some (relative) outer space \mathcal{O}. We study the asymmetry of the Lipschitz metric d_R on the (relative) Outer space \mathcal{O}. More specifically, we generalise the construction of Algom-Kfir and Bestvina, introducing an (asymmetric) Finsler norm \|\cdot\|^{L} that induces d_R. Let's denote by Out(G, \mathcal{O}) the outer automorphisms of G that preserve the set of conjugacy classes of G_i's. Then there is an Out(G, \mathcal{O})-invariant function \Psi : \mathcal{O} \rightarrow \mathbb{R} such that when \| \cdot \|^{L} is corrected by d \Psi, the resulting norm is quasisymmetric. As an application, we prove that if we restrict d_R to the \epsilon-thick part of the relative Outer space for some \epsilon >0, is quasi-symmetric . Finally, we generalise for IWIP automorphisms of a free product a theorem of Handel and Mosher, which states that there is a uniform bound which depends only on the group, on the ratio of the relative expansion factors of any IWIP \phi \in Out(F_n) and its inverse.
