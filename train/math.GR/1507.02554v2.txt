In 2013, Kharlampovich, Myasnikov, and Sapir constructed the first examples of finitely presented residually finite groups with large Dehn functions. Given any recursive function f, they produce a finitely presented residually finite group with Dehn function dominating f. There are no known elementary examples of finitely presented residually finite groups with super-exponential Dehn function. Dison and Riley's hydra groups can be used to construct a sequence of groups for which the Dehn function of the k-th group is equivalent to the k-th Ackermann function. Kharlampovich, Myasnikov, and Sapir asked whether or not these groups are residually finite. We show that these constructions do not produce residually finite groups.
