We define a cipher that is an extension of GOST, and study the permutation group generated by its round functions. We show that, under minimal assumptions on the components of the cipher, this group is the alternating group on the plaintext space. This we do by first showing that the group is primitive, and then applying the O'Nan-Scott classification of primitive groups.
