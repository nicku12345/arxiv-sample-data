Denote by \omega(G) the number of orbits of the action of Aut(G) on the finite group G. We prove that if G is a finite nonsolvable group in which \omega(G) \leqslant 5, then G is isomorphic to one of the groups A_5,A_6,PSL(2,7) or PSL(2,8). We also consider the case when \omega(G) = 6 and show that if G is a nonsolvable finite group with \omega(G) = 6, then either G \simeq PSL(3,4) or there exists a characteristic elementary abelian 2-subgroup N of G such that G/N \simeq A_5.
