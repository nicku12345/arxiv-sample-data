In constructive recognition of a representation of a Classical group G, much attention has been paid to the natural representation as well as to generic (Black Box) algorithms that treat all representations uniformly. There are theoretical and practical improvements to be made by giving special treatment to certain non-natural representations that arise frequently. In this paper we present and analyse a Las Vegas algorithm for rewriting the Symmetric Square representation.
