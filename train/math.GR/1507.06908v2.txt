The set of finitely generated subgroups of the group PL_+(I) of orientation-preserving piecewise-linear homeomorphisms of the unit interval includes many important groups, most notably R.~Thompson's group F. In this paper we show that every finitely generated subgroup G<PL_+(I) is either soluble, or contains an embedded copy of Brin's group B, a finitely generated, non-soluble group, which verifies a conjecture of the first author from 2009. In the case that G is soluble, we show that the derived length of G is bounded above by the number of breakpoints of any finite set of generators. We specify a set of `computable' subgroups of PL_+(I) (which includes R. Thompson's group F) and we give an algorithm which determines in finite time whether or not any given finite subset X of such a computable group generates a soluble group. When the group is soluble, the algorithm also determines the derived length of \langle X\rangle. Finally, we give a solution of the membership problem for a family of finitely generated soluble subgroups of any computable subgroup of PL_+(I).
