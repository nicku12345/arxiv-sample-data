A p-subgroup H of a finite group G is said to satisfy partial S-\Pi-property in G if G has a chief series \Gamma_{G}: 1=G_{0}<G_{1}<\cdots<G_{n}=G such that for every G-chief factor G_{i}/G_{i-1} (1\leqslant i\leqslant n) of \Gamma_{G}, either (H\cap G_{i})G_{i-1}/G_{i-1} is a Sylow p-subgroup of G_{i}/G_{i-1} or |G/G_{i-1}: N_{G/G_{i-1}}((H\cap G_{i})G_{i-1}/G_{i-1})| is a p-number. In this paper, we mainly investigate the structure of finite groups with some primary subgroups satisfying partial S-\Pi-property.
