We investigate the Ihara zeta functions of finite Schreier graphs \Gamma_n of the Basilica group. We show that \Gamma_{1+n} is 2 sheeted unramified normal covering of \Gamma_n, ~\forall~ n \geq 1 with Galois group \displaystyle \frac{\mathbb{Z}}{2\mathbb{Z}}. In fact, for any n > 1, r \geq 1 the graph \Gamma_{n+r} is 2^n sheeted unramified, non normal covering of \Gamma_r. In order to do this we give the definition of the generalized replacement product of Schreier graphs. We also show the corresponding results in zig zag product of Schreier graphs \Gamma_n with a 4 cycle.
