On the transversals of a subgroup of a group, using the binary operation of the group, structural mappings are defined. Based on these mappings, the notion of the hypergroup over the group is introduced, which generalizes the notion of the quotient-group of the given group with respect to the normal subgroup. The category of the hypergroups over the group contains as subcategories the category of groups, the category of linear spaces, the category of fields.
