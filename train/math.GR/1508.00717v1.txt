Assume that a finite group G admits a Frobenius group of automorphisms FH with kernel F and complement H such that C_{G}(F)=1. In this paper, we investigate this situation and prove that if C_G(H) is supersoluble and C_{G'}(H) is nilpotent, then G is supersoluble. Also, we show that G is a Sylow tower group of a certain type if C_{G}(H) is a Sylow tower group of the same type.
