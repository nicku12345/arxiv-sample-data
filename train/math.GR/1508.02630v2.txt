We generalize earlier work of Fuertes and Gonz\'{a}lez-Diez as well as earlier work of Bauer, Catanese and Grunewald to Coxeter groups in general by classifying which of these are strongly real Beauville groups. As a consequence of this we determine which of these groups are Beauville groups. We also show that none of these groups are mixed Beaville groups as well as proving that no Coxeter group is a mixable Beauville group.
