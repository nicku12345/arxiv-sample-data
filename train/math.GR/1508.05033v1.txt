We show the necessary part of the following theorem : a finitely generated, residually finite group has property PL^p (i.e. it admits a proper isometric affine action on some L^p space) if, and only if, one (or equivalently, all) of its box spaces admits a fibred coarse embedding into some L^p space. We also prove that coarse embeddability of a box space of a group into a L^p space implies property PL^p for this group.
