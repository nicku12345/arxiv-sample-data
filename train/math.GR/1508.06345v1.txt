We present an understandable, efficient, and streamlined proof of the Holonomy Decomposition for finite transformation semigroups and automata. This constructive proof closely follows the existing computational implementation. Its novelty lies in the strict separation of several different ideas appearing in the holonomy method. The steps of the proof and the constructions are illustrated with computed examples.
