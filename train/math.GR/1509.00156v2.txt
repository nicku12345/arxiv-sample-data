Let \phi: G \rightarrow H be a group homomorphism such that H is a totally disconnected locally compact (t.d.l.c.) group and the image of \phi is dense. We show that all such homomorphisms arise as completions of G with respect to uniformities of a particular kind. Moreover, H is determined up to a compact normal subgroup by the pair (G,\phi^{-1}(L)), where L is a compact open subgroup of H. These results generalize the well-known properties of profinite completions to the locally compact setting.
