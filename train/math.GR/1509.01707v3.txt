For each positive n, let u_n = v_n denote the identity obtained from the Adjan identity (xy) (yx) (xy) (xy) (yx) = (xy) (yx) (yx) (xy) (yx) by substituting (xy) \rightarrow (x_1 x_2 \dots x_n) and (yx) \rightarrow (x_n \dots x_2 x_1). We show that every monoid which satisfies u_n = v_n for each positive n and generates the variety containing the bicyclic monoid is nonfinitely based.   This implies that the monoid of 2 by 2 upper triangular tropical matrices over the tropical semiring is nonfinitely based.
