We use the Bass--Jiang group for automorphism-induced HNN-extensions to build a framework for the construction of tractable groups with pathological outer automorphism groups. We apply this framework to a strong form of a question of Bumagin--Wise on the outer automorphism groups of finitely presented, residually finite groups.
