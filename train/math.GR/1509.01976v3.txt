Let k be a field and A be a generalised Cartan matrix, and let {\mathfrak G}_A(k) be the corresponding minimal Kac-Moody group of simply connected type over k. Consider the completion {\mathfrak G}_A^{pma}(k) of {\mathfrak G}_A(k) introduced by O. Mathieu and G. Rousseau, and let {\mathfrak U}_A^{ma+}(k) denote the unipotent radical of the positive Borel subgroup of {\mathfrak G}_A^{pma}(k). In this paper, we exhibit some functoriality dependence of the groups {\mathfrak U}_A^{ma+}(k) and {\mathfrak G}_A^{pma}(k) on their Lie algebra. We also produce a large class of examples of minimal Kac-Moody groups {\mathfrak G}_A(k) that are not dense in their Mathieu-Rousseau completion {\mathfrak G}_A^{pma}(k). Finally, we explain how the problematic of providing a unified theory of complete Kac-Moody groups is related to the conjecture of Gabber-Kac simplicity of {\mathfrak G}_A^{pma}(k), stating that every normal subgroup of {\mathfrak G}_A^{pma}(k) that is contained in {\mathfrak U}_A^{ma+}(k) must be trivial. We present several motivations for the study of this conjecture, as well as several applications of our functoriality theorem, with contributions to the question of (non-)linearity of {\mathfrak U}_A^{ma+}(k), and to the isomorphism problem for complete Kac-Moody groups over finite fields. For k finite, we also make some observations on the structure of {\mathfrak U}_A^{ma+}(k) in the light of some important concepts from the theory of pro-p groups.
