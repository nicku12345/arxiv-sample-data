An element g of a group G is a test element if every endomorphism of G that fixes g is an automorphism. Let G be a free group of finite rank, an orientable surface group of genus n \geq 2, or a non-orientable surface group of genus n \geq 3. Let \mathcal{T} be the set of test elements of G. We prove that \mathcal{T} is a net. From this result we derive that \mathcal{T} has positive asymptotic density in G. This answers a question of Kapovich, Rivin, Schupp, and Shpilrain. Furthermore, we prove that \mathcal{T} is dense in the profinite topology on G.
