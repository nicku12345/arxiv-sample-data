We start by an original investigation on subgroups of (even infinite) direct sums in the first 4 sections, that largely generalizes Remak's known theorem; inspired by that general picture we have elsewhere extended this elementary "virtual" diagrammatic situation (in diagrammatic length 2 meaning set-theoretic fixation of vertices) by generalizing to the notion of "virtuality" in module extensions and diagrams in modular representation theory. Our first approach starts with an appropriately defined equivalence relation, which is precisely what allows for treating the confusing case of multiple factors, thus giving a deeper insight into the structure of such subgroups. Several applications and new techniques arising from that approach are examined, even ones concerning basic properties of homomorphisms, extending well-known elementary ones.
