In this paper, we investigate the reducibility property of semidirect products of the form \bf V*\bf D relatively to (pointlike) systems of equations of the form x_1=\cdots=x_n, where \bf D denotes the pseudovariety of definite semigroups. We establish a connection between pointlike reducibility of \bf V*\bf D and the pointlike reducibility of the pseudovariety \bf V. In particular, for the canonical signature \kappa consisting of the multiplication and the (\omega-1)-power, we show that \bf V*\bf D is pointlike \kappa-reducible when \bf V is pointlike \kappa-reducible.
