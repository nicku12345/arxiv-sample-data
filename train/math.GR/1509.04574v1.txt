Let G be a group. The intersection graph of cyclic subgroups of G, denoted by \mathscr I_c(G), is a graph having all the proper cyclic subgroups of G as its vertices and two distinct vertices in \mathscr I_c(G) are adjacent if and only if their intersection is non-trivial. In this paper, we classify the finite groups whose intersection graph of cyclic subgroups is one of totally disconnected, complete, star, path, cycle. We show that for a given finite group G, girth(\mathscr I_c (G)) \in \{3, \infty\}. Moreover, we classify all finite non-cyclic abelian groups whose intersection graph of cyclic subgroups is planar. Also for any group G, we determine the independence number, clique cover number of \mathscr I_c (G) and show that \mathscr I_c (G) is weakly \alpha-perfect. Among the other results, we determine the values of n for which \mathscr I_c (\mathbb{Z}_n) is regular and estimate its domination number.
