We study the arithmetic and geometry properties of the Hecke group G_q. In particular, we prove that G_q has a subgroup X  of index d, genus g with v_{\infty}  cusps, and \tau_2 (resp. v_{r_i}) conjugacy classes of elements that are conjugates of S (resp. R^{q/r_i}) if and only if (i)  2g-2 + \tau_2/2 +\sum_{i=1}^k v_{r_i}(1-1/r_i) + v_{\infty} = d(1/2-1/q), and (ii)  m _0= 4g-4 +\tau_2 + 2 v_{\infty} + \sum _{i=1}^k v_{r_i}(2-q/r_i)\ge 0 is a multiple of q-2, (iii) m \ge 0. In the case q is odd, (ii) is a consequence of (i).
