Let T be a locally finite tree all of whose vertices have valency at least 6. We classify, up to isomorphism, the closed subgroups of \mathrm{Aut}(T) acting 2-transitively on the set of ends of T and whose local action at each vertex contains the alternating group. The outcome of the classification for a fixed tree T is a countable family of groups, all containing two remarkable subgroups: a simple subgroup of index \leq 8 and (the semiregular analog of) the universal locally alternating group of Burger-Mozes (with possibly infinite index). We also provide an explicit example showing that the statement of this classification fails for trees of smaller degree.
