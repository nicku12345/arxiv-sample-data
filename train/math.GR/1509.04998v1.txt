We show that the proportion of permutations g in S_n or A_n such that g has even order and g^{|g|/2} is an involution with support of cardinality at most \lceil n^\varepsilon \rceil is at least a constant multiple of \varepsilon. Using this result, we obtain the same conclusion for elements in a classical group of natural dimension n in odd characteristic that have even order and power up to an involution with (-1)-eigenspace of dimension at most \lceil n^\varepsilon \rceil for a linear or unitary group, or 2\lceil \lfloor n/2 \rfloor^\varepsilon \rceil for a symplectic or orthogonal group.
