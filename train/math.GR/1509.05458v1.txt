This is a companion to our lectures GAP and loops, to be delivered at the Workshops Loops 2007, Prague, Czech Republic. In the lectures we introduce the GAP package LOOPS, describe its capabilities, and explain in detail how to use it. In this paper we first outline the philosophy behind the package and its main features, and then we focus on three particular computational problems: construction of loop isomorphisms, classification of small Frattini Moufang loops of order 64, and the search for loops of nilpotency class higher than two with an abelian inner mapping group.   In particular, this is not a user's manual for LOOPS, which can be downloaded from the distribution website of LOOPS.
