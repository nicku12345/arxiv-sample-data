We give a necessary and sufficient condition for the fundamental group of a finite graph of groups with infinite cyclic edge groups to be acylindrically hyperbolic, from which it follows that a finitely generated group splitting over Z cannot be simple. We also give a necessary and sufficient condition (when the vertex groups are torsion free) for the fundamental group to be balanced, where a group is said to be balanced if x^m conjugate to x^n implies that |m|=|n| for all infinite order elements x.
