A groupoid is alternative if it satisfies the alternative laws x(xy)=(xx)y and x(yy)=(xy)y. These laws induce four partial maps on \mathbb{N}^+\times \mathbb{N}^+, (r,\,s)\mapsto (2r,\,s-r), (r-s,\,2s), (r/2,\,s+r/2), (r+s/2,\,s/2) that taken together form a dynamical system. We describe the orbits of this dynamical system, which allows us to show that nth powers in a free alternative groupoid on one generator are well-defined if and only if n\le 5. We then discuss some number theoretical properties of the orbits, and the existence of alternative loops without two-sided inverses.
