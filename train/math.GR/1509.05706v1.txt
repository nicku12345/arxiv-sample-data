In 2004, Cs\"{o}rg\H{o} constructed a loop of nilpotency class three with abelian group of inner mappings. Until now, no other examples were known. We construct many such loops from groups of nilpotency class two by replacing the product xy with xyh in certain positions, where h is a central involution. The location of the replacements is ultimately governed by a symmetric trilinear alternating form.
