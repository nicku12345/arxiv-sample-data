A loop is said to be automorphic if its inner mappings are automorphisms. For a prime p, denote by \mathcal A_p the class of all 2-generated commutative automorphic loops Q possessing a central subloop Z\cong \mathbb Z_p such that Q/Z\cong\mathbb Z_p\times\mathbb Z_p. Upon describing the free 2-generated nilpotent class two commutative automorphic loop and the free 2-generated nilpotent class two commutative automorphic p-loop F_p in the variety of loops whose elements have order dividing p^2 and whose associators have order dividing p, we show that every loop of \mathcal A_p is a quotient of F_p by a central subloop of order p^3. The automorphism group of F_p induces an action of GL_2(p) on the three-dimensional subspaces of Z(F_p)\cong (\mathbb Z_p)^4. The orbits of this action are in one-to-one correspondence with the isomorphism classes of loops from \mathcal A_p. We describe the orbits, and hence we classify the loops of \mathcal A_p up to isomorphism.   It is known that every commutative automorphic p-loop is nilpotent when p is odd, and that there is a unique commutative automorphic loop of order 8 with trivial center. Knowing \mathcal A_p up to isomorphism, we easily obtain a classification of commutative automorphic loops of order p^3. There are precisely 7 commutative automorphic loops of order p^3 for every prime p, including the 3 abelian groups of order p^3.
