A subset \{g_1, \ldots , g_d\} of a finite group G invariably generates G if \{g_1^{x_1}, \ldots , g_d^{x_d}\} generates G for every choice of x_i \in G. The Chebotarev invariant C(G) of G is the expected value of the random variable n that is minimal subject to the requirement that n randomly chosen elements of G invariably generate G. Confirming a conjecture of Kowalski and Zywina, we prove that there exists an absolute constant \beta such that C(G) \leq \beta\sqrt{|G|} for all finite groups G.
