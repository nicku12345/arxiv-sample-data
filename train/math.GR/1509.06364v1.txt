Andrew Rajah posed at the Loops'11 Conference in Trest, Czech Republic, the following conjecture: Is every variety of loops that satisfies Moufang's theorem contained in the variety of Moufang loops? This paper is motivated by that problem. We give a partial answer to this question and present two types of Steiner loops, one that satisfies Moufang's theorem and another that does not, and neither is Moufang loop.
