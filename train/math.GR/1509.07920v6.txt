Let \mathfrak A be an alphabet and W be a set of words in the free monoid {\mathfrak A}^*. Let S(W) denote the Rees quotient over the ideal of {\mathfrak A}^* consisting of all words that are not subwords of words in W. A set of words W is called {\em finitely based} if the monoid S(W) is finitely based.   A word \bf u is called 2-limited if each variable occurs in \bf u at most twice. A {\em block} of a word \bf u is a maximal subword of \bf u that does not contain any linear variables. We say that a word \bf u is {\em block-2-simple} if each block of \bf u involves at most two distinct variables. We provide an algorithm that recognizes finitely based sets of words among sets of 2-limited block-2-simple words.   We also present new sufficient conditions under which a set of words is non-finitely based.
