We investigate the class \mathcal{MN} of groups with the property that all maximal subgroups are normal. The class \mathcal{MN} appeared in the framework of the study of potential counter-examples to the Andrews-Curtis conjecture. In this note we give various structural properties of groups in \mathcal{MN} and present examples of groups in \mathcal{MN} and not in \mathcal{MN}.
