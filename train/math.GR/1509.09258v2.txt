We provide an upper bound on the \ell^{2}-torsion of a free-by-cyclic group, -\rho^{(2)}(\mathbb{F} \rtimes_{\Phi} \mathbb{Z}), in terms of a relative train-track representative for \Phi \in \mathrm{Aut}(\mathbb{F}). Our result shares features with a theorem of L\"uck-Schick computing the \ell^{2}-torsion of the fundamental group of a 3-manifold that fibers over the circle in that it shows that the \ell^{2}-torsion is determined by the exponential dynamics of the monodromy. In light of the result of L\"uck-Schick, a special case of our bound is analogous to the bound on the volume of a 3-manifold that fibers over the circle with pseudo-Anosov monodromy by the normalized entropy recently demonstrated by Kojima-McShane.
