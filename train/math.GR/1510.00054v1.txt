Symmetric k-varieties generalize Riemannian sym\-me\-tric spaces to reductive groups defined over arbitrary fields. For most perfect fields, it is known that symmetric k-varieties are in one-to-one correspondence with isomorphy classes of k-involutions. Therefore, it is useful to have representatives of each isomorphy class in order to describe the k-varieties. Here we give matrix representatives for each isomorphy class of k-involutions of \text{SL}(n,k) in the case that k is any field of characteristic 2; we also describe fixed point groups of each type of involution.
