Let G be a group. We define the coprime graph of subgroups of G, denoted by \mathcal P(G), is a graph whose vertex set is the set of all proper subgroups of G, and two distinct vertices are adjacent if and only if the order of the corresponding subgroups are coprime. In this paper, we study some connections between algebraic properties of a group and graph theoretic properties of its coprime graph.
