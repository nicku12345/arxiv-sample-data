Let G be a simple algebraic group of type E_n (n=6,7,8) defined over an algebraically closed field k of characteristic 2. We present examples of triples of closed reductive groups H<M<G such that H is G-completely reducible, but not M-completely reducible. As an application, we consider a question of K\"ulshammer on representations of finite groups in reductive groups. We also consider a rationality problem for G-complete reducibility and a problem concerning conjugacy classes.
