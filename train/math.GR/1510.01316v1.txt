A new subclass of AG-groupoids, so called, cyclic associative Abel-Grassman groupoids or CA-AG-groupoid is studied. These have been enumerated up to order 6. A test for the verification of cyclic associativity for an arbitrary AG-groupoid has been introduced. Various properties of CA-AG-groupoids have been studied. Relationship among CA-AG-groupoids and other subclasses of AG-groupoids is investigated. It is shown that the subclass of CA-AG-groupoid is different from that of the AG{*}-groupoid as well as AG{*}{*}-groupoids.
