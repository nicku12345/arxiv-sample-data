In parallel to the classical theory of central extensions of groups, we develop a version for extensions that preserve commutativity. It is shown that the Bogomolov multiplier is a universal object parametrising such extensions of a given group. Maximal and minimal extensions are inspected, and a connection with commuting probability is explored. Such considerations produce bounds for the exponent and rank of the Bogomolov multiplier.
