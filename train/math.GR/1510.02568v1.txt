In this paper we introduced an arithmetic graph function which associates with every group G the directed graph whose vertices corresponds to the divisors of |G|. With the help of such functions we introduced arithmetic graphs of classes of groups, in particular of hereditary saturated formations. We formulated the problem of the recognition of classes of groups by arithmetic graph functions and investigated this problem for some arithmetic graph functions.
