We construct rearrangement groups for edge replacement systems, an infinite class of groups that generalize Richard Thompson's groups F, T, and V . Rearrangement groups act by piecewise-defined homeomorphisms on many self-similar topological spaces, among them the Vicsek fractal and many Julia sets. We show that every rearrangement group acts properly on a locally finite CAT(0) cubical complex, and we use this action to prove that certain rearrangement groups are of type F infinity.
