We investigate the intersection of normalizers and \mathfrak{F}-subnormalizers of different types of systems of subgroups (\mathfrak{F}-maximal, Sylow, cyclic primary). We described all formations \mathfrak{F}=\underset{i\in I}\times\mathfrak{F}_{\pi_i} for which the intersection of normalizers of all \mathfrak{F}_i-maximal subgroups of G is the \mathfrak{F}-hypercenter of G for every group G. Also we described all formations \mathfrak{F} for which the intersection of \mathfrak{F}-subnormalizers of all Sylow (cyclic primary) subgroups of G is the \mathfrak{F}-hypercenter of G for every group G.
