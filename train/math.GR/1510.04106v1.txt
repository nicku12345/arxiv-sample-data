This paper provides the first steps in classifying the finite solvable groups having Property A, which is a property involving abelian normal subgroups. We see that this classification is reduced to classifying the solvable Chermak-Delgado simple groups, which the author defines. The author completes a classification of Chermak-Delgado simple groups under certain restrictions on the primes involved in the group order.
