In this note we prove the claim given in the title. A group G is noncommutatively slender if each map from the fundamental group of the Hawaiian Earring to G factors through projection to a canonical free subgroup. Graham Higman, in his seminal 1952 paper, proved that free groups are noncommutatively slender. Such groups were first defined by K. Eda. Eda has asked which finitely presented groups are noncommutatively slender. This result demonstrates that random finitely presented groups in the few- relator sense of Gromov are noncommutatively slender.
