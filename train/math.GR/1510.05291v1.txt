Let S be a semigroup, \Lambda a non-empty set and P a mapping of \Lambda into S. The set S\times \Lambda together with the operation \circ _P defined by (s, \lambda)\circ _P(t, \mu )=(sP(\lambda)t, \mu ) form a semigroup which is denoted by (S, \Lambda , \circ _P). Using this construction, we prove a common connection between the semigroups S, S/\theta and S/\theta ^*=(S/\theta)/(\theta ^*/\theta), where \theta and \theta ^*/\theta are the kernels of the right regular representations of S and S/\theta, respectively. We also prove an embedding theorem for the semigroup (S, S/\theta , \circ _p), where S is a left equalizer simple semigroup without idempotents, and P maps every \theta-class of S into itself.
