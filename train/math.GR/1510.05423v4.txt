Given a simple Lie group G, we show that the lattices in G are weakly uniformly discrete. This is a strengthening of the Kazhdan-Margulis theorem. Our proof however is straightforward --- considering general IRS rather than lattices allows us to apply a compactness argument. In terms of p.m.p. actions, we show that for every \epsilon there is an identity neighbourhood U which intersects trivially the stabilizers of 1-\epsilon of the points in every non-atomic G-space.
