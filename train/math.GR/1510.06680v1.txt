A 2-(n,4,\lambda) design (\Omega, \mathcal{B}) is said to be supersimple if distinct lines intersect in at most two points. From such a design, one can construct a certain subset of Sym(\Omega) called a "Conway groupoid". The construction generalizes Conway's construction of the groupoid M_{13}. It turns out that several infinite families of groupoids arise in this way, some associated with 3-transposition groups, which have two additional properties. Firstly the set of collinear point-triples forms a regular two-graph, and secondly the symmetric difference of two intersecting lines is again a line. In this paper, we show each of these properties corresponds to a group-theoretic property on the groupoid and we classify the Conway groupoids and the supersimple designs for which both of these two additional properties hold.
