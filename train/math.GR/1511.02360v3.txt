A block cipher can be easily broken if its encryption functions can be seen as linear maps on a small vector space. Even more so, if its round functions can be seen as linear maps on a small vector space. We show that this cannot happen for the AES. More precisely, we prove that if the AES round transformations can be embedded into a linear cipher acting on a vector space, then this space is huge-dimensional and so this embedding is infeasible in practice. We present two elementary proofs.
