In this paper we give necessary conditions on group presentations, with two generators and one relator, in order to be the group of a virtual knot diagram. Although those conditions are not enough, we use them to determine, completely, whether or not a Baumslag-Solitar group is the group of a 2-bridge virtual knot. Moreover, we present a combinatorial proof of the fact that these groups are not 2-bridge classical knot groups.
