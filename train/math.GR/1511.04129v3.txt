Let G be a finite group and cd(G) denote the set of complex irreducible character degrees of G. In this paper, we prove that if G is a finite group and H is an almost simple group whose socle is Mathieu group such that cd(G) =cd(H), then there exists an Abelian subgroup A of G such that G/A is isomorphic to H. This study is heading towards the study of an extension of Huppert's conjecture (2000) for almost simple groups.
