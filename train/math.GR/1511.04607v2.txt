A group G is called subgroup conjugacy separable if for every pair of non-conjugate finitely generated subgroups of G, there exists a finite quotient of G where the images of these subgroups are not conjugate. We prove that limit groups are subgroup conjugacy separable. We also prove this property for one relator groups of the form R=\langle a_1,...,a_n\mid W^n\rangle with n>|W|. The property is also proved for virtual retracts (equivalently for quasiconvex subgroups) of hyperbolic virtually special groups.
