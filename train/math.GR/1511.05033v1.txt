In "Frobenius Categories versus Brauer Blocks" and in "Ordinary Grothendieck groups of a Frobenius P-category" we consider suitable inverse limits of Grothendieck groups of categories of modules in characteristics p and zero, obtained from a so-called "folded Frobenius P-category", which covers the case of the Frobenius P-categories associated with blocks, moreover, in "Affirmative answer to a question of Linckelmann" we show that a "folded Frobenius P-category" is actually equivalent to the choice of a regular central k*-extension of the Frobenius P-category restricted to the set of F-selfcentralizing subgroups of P. Here, taking advantage of the existence of the perfect F-locality L, recently proved, we exhibit those inverse limits as the true Grothendieck groups of the categories of K*\hat G- and k*\hat G-modules for a suitable k*-group \hat G associated to the k*-category obtained from the perfect F-locality L and \hat F, both restricted to the set of F-selfcentralizing subgroups of P.
