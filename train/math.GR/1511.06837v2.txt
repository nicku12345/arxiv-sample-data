Given a finite group G, we introduce the \textit{permutability degree} of G, as pd(G)=\frac{1}{|G| \ |\mathcal{L}(G)|} {\underset{X \in \mathcal{L}(G)}\sum}|P_G(X)|, where \mathcal{L}(G) is the subgroup lattice of G and P_G(X) the permutizer of the subgroup X in G, that is, the subgroup generated by all cyclic subgroups of G that permute with X\in \mathcal{L}(G). The number pd(G) allows us to find some structural restrictions on G. Successively, we investigate the relations between pd(G), the probability of commuting subgroups sd(G) of G and the probability of commuting elements d(G) of G. Proving some inequalities between pd(G), sd(G) and d(G), we correlate these notions.
