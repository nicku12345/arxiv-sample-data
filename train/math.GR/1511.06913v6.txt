In this two part work we prove that for every finitely generated subgroup \Gamma < \text{Out}(F_n), either \Gamma is virtually abelian or H^2_b(\Gamma;\mathbb{R}) contains an embedding of \ell^1. The method uses actions on hyperbolic spaces, for purposes of constructing quasimorphisms. Here in Part I, after presenting the general theory, we focus on the case of infinite lamination subgroups \Gamma - those for which the set of all attracting laminations of all elements of \Gamma is infinite - using actions on free splitting complexes of free groups.
