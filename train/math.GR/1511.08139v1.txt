In this paper, we determine the structure of the nilpotent multipliers of all pairs (G,N) of finitely generated abelian groups where N admits a complement in G. We also show that every nilpotent pair of groups of class at most k with non trivial c-nilpotent multiplier does not admit any c-covering pair, for all c>k. Moreover, some inequalities for the nilpotent multiplier of a pair of finite groups and their factor groups are given.
