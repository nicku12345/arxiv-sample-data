Given a non-abelian finite simple group G of Lie type, and an arbitrary generating set S, it is conjectured by Laszlo Babai that its Cayley graph \Gamma (G,S) will have a diameter of (\log |G|)^{O(1)}. However, little progress has been made when the rank of G is large. In this article, we shall show that if G has rank n, and its base field has order q, then the diameter of \Gamma (G,S) would be q^{O(n(\log n + \log q)^3)}.
