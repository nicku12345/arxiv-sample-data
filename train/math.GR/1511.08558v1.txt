Let G be a finite group and let \pi(G)=\{p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_k\} be the set of prime divisors of |G| for which p_1<p_2<\cdots<p_k. The Gruenberg-Kegel graph of G, denoted {\rm GK}(G), is defined as follows: its vertex set is \pi(G) and two different vertices p_i and p_j are adjacent by an edge if and only if G contains an element of order p_ip_j. The degree of a vertex p_i in {\rm GK}(G) is denoted by d_G(p_i) and the k-tuple D(G)=\left(d_G(p_1), d_G(p_2), \ldots, d_G(p_k)\right) is said to be the degree pattern of G. Moreover, if \omega \subseteq \pi(G) is the vertex set of a connected component of {\rm GK}(G), then the largest \omega-number which divides |G|, is said to be an order component of {\rm GK}(G). We will say that the problem of OD-characterization is solved for a finite group if we find the number of pairwise non-isomorphic finite groups with the same order and degree pattern as the group under study. The purpose of this article is twofold. First, we completely solve the problem of OD-characterization for every finite non-abelian simple group with orders having prime divisors at most 29. In particular, we show that there are exactly two non-isomorphic finite groups with the same order and degree pattern as U_4(2). Second, we prove that there are exactly two non-isomorphic finite groups with the same order components as U_5(2).
