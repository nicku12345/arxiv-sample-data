This exposition article arose from two talks given during the Oberwolfach Arbeitsgemeinschaft on Totally Disconnected Groups in October 2014.   This is an introduction to the structure theory of totally disconnected locally compact groups initiated by Willis in 1994. The two main tools in this theory are the scale function and tidy subgroups, for which we present several properties and examples.   As an illustration of this theory, we give a proof of the fact that the set of periodic elements in a totally disconnected locally compact group is always closed, and that such a group cannot have ergodic automorphisms as soon as it is non-compact.
