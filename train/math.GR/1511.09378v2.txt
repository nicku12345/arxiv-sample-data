Finite-above inverse monoids are a common generalization of finite inverse monoids and Margolis--Meakin expansions of groups. Given a finite-above E-unitary inverse monoid M and a group variety \mathit{U}, we find a condition for M and \mathit{U}, involving a construction of descending chains of graphs, which is equivalent to M having an F-inverse cover via \mathit{U}. In the special case where \mathit{U}=\mathit{Ab}, the variety of Abelian groups, we apply this condition to get a simple sufficient condition for M to have no F-inverse cover via \mathit{Ab}, formulated by means of the natural parial order and the least group congruence of M.
