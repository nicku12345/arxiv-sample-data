A Houghton's group \mathcal{H}_n consists of translations at infinity of a n rays of discrete points on the plane. In this paper we study the growth rate of endomorphisms of Houghton's groups. We show that if the kernel of an endomorphism \phi is not trivial then the growth rate \mathrm{GR}(\phi) equals either 1 or the spectral radius of the induced map on the abelianization. It turns out that every monomorphism \phi of \mathcal{H}_n determines a unique natural number \ell such that \phi(\mathcal{H}_n) is generated by translations with the same translation length \ell. We use this to show that \mathrm{GR}(\phi) of a monomorphism \phi of \mathcal{H}_n is precisely \ell for all 2\leq n.
