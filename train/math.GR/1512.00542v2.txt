In this paper we study the quotient and "blow-up" of graph-of-groups \cal{G} and of their automorphisms H: \cal{G} \rightarrow \cal{G}. We show that the existence of such a "blow-up" of \bar{H}: \bar{\cal{G}} \rightarrow \bar{\cal{G}} relative to a given family of "local" graph-of-groups isomorphisms H_{i}: \cal{G}_{i} \rightarrow \cal{G}_{i} depends crucially on the H_{i}-conjugacy class of the correction term \delta(\bar{E}_{i}) for any edge \bar{E}_{i} of \bar{\cal{G}}, where H-congjugacy is a new but natural concept introduced here. As an application we obtain a criterion as to whether a partial Dehn twist can be blown up relative to local Dehn twists to give an actual Dehn twist.
