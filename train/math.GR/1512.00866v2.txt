We show that a one-ended simply connected at infinity hyperbolic group G with enough codimension-1 surface subgroups has \partial G \cong \mathbb{S}^2. Combined with a result of Markovic, our result gives a new characterization of virtually fundamental groups of hyperbolic 3-manifolds.   Keywords: CAT(0) cube complexes, Hyperbolic groups, hyperbolic 3-manifolds.
