Let G be a finite non-cyclic group. The non-cyclic graph \Gamma_G of G is the graph whose vertex set is G\setminus Cyc(G), two distinct vertices being adjacent if they do not generate a cyclic subgroup, where Cyc(G)=\{a\in G: \langle a,b\rangle\ \text{is cyclic for each } b\in G\}. In this paper, we classify all finite non-cyclic groups G such that \Gamma_G has (non)orientable genus one.
