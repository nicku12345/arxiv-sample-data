The commensurability index between two subgroups A, B of a group G is [A : A \cap B] [B : A\cap B]. This gives a notion of distance amongst finite-index subgroups of G, which is encoded in the p-local commensurability graphs of G. We show that for any metabelian group, any component of the p-local commensurabilty graph of G has diameter bounded above by 4. However, no universal upper bound on diameters of components exists for the class of finite solvable groups. In the appendix we give a complete classification of components for upper triangular matrix groups in \text{GL}(2, \mathbb{F}_q).
