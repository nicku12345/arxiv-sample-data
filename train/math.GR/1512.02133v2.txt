We show that every bounded automaton group can be embedded in a finitely generated, simple amenable group. The proof is based on the study of the topological full groups associated to the Schreier dynamical system of the mother groups. We also show that if \mathcal{G} is a minimal \'etale groupoid with unit space the Cantor set, the group [[\mathcal{G}]]_t generated by all torsion elements in the topological full group has simple commutator subgroup.
