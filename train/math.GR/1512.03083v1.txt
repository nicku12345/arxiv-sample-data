We prove that the Poisson boundary of a simple random walk on the Schreier graph of action of F on \mathbb{D}, where \mathbb{D} is the set of dyadic numbers in [0, 1], is non-trivial. This gives a new proof of the result of Kaimanovich: Thompson's group F doesn't have Liouville property. In addition, we compute growth function of the Schreier graph of the action of F on \mathbb{D}.
