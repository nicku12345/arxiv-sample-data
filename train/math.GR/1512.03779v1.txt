We study the semigroup \mathscr{I}^{\mathrm{cf}}_\lambda of injective partial cofinite selfmaps of an infinite cardinal \lambda. We show that \mathscr{I}^{\mathrm{cf}}_\lambda is a bisimple inverse semigroup and each chain of idempotents in \mathscr{I}^{\mathrm{cf}}_\lambda is contained in a bicyclic subsemigroup of \mathscr{I}^{\mathrm{cf}}_\lambda, we describe the Green relations on \mathscr{I}^{\mathrm{cf}}_\lambda and we prove that every non-trivial congruence on \mathscr{I}^{\mathrm{cf}}_\lambda is a group congruence. Also, we describe the structure of the quotient semigroup \mathscr{I}^{\mathrm{cf}}_\lambda/\sigma, where \sigma is the least group congruence on \mathscr{I}^{\mathrm{cf}}_\lambda.
