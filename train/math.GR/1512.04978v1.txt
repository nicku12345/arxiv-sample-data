We classify all real and strongly real classes of the finite special unitary group SU_n(q). Unless q \equiv 3 (mod 4) and n |4, the classification of real classes is similar to that of the finite special linear group SL_n(q). We relate strong reality in SU_n(q) to strong reality in the finite special orthogonal groups SO^\pm_n(q), and we classify real and strongly real classes in the last case for the group SO^\pm_n(q), when q is odd and n \equiv 2 (mod 4).
