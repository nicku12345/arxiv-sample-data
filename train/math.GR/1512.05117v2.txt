Let G be a finite group and S a subset of G. Then S is {\em product-free} if S \cap SS = \emptyset, and S {\em fills} G if G^{\ast} \subseteq S \cup SS. A product-free set is locally maximal if it is not contained in a strictly larger product-free set. Street and Whitehead [J. Combin. Theory Ser. A \textbf{17} (1974), 219--226] defined a group G as {\em filled} if every locally maximal product-free set in G fills G. Street and Whitehead classified all abelian filled groups, and conjectured that the finite dihedral group of order 2n is not filled when n=6k+1 (k\geq 1). The conjecture was disproved by the current authors in [Austral. Journal of Combinatorics \textbf{63 (3)} (2015), 385--398], where we also classified the filled groups of odd order. This brief note completes the classification of filled dihedral groups and discusses filled groups of order up to 100.
