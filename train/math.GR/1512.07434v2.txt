Suppose that \chi is an irreducible complex character of G and let f_\chi be the smallest integer n such that the cyclotomic field \mathbb Q_n contains the values of \chi. Let p be a prime, and assume that \chi \in \textrm{Irr}(G) has degree not divisible by p. If G is solvable and \chi(1) is odd, then there exists g \in {\bf N}_G(P) /P' with o(g)=f_\chi. In particular f_\chi divides |{\bf N}_G(P) /P'|.
