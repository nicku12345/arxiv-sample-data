We introduce the notion of \"uber-contracting element, a strengthening of the notion of strongly contracting element which yields a particularly tractable criterion to show the acylindrical hyperbolicity, and thus a strong form of non-simplicity, of groups acting on non locally compact spaces of arbitrary dimension. We also give a simple local criterion to construct \"uber-contracting elements for groups acting on complexes with unbounded links of vertices.   As an application, we show the acylindrical hyperbolicity of the tame automorphism group of \mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{C}), a subgroup of the 3-dimensional Cremona group, through its action on a CAT(0) square complex recently introduced by Bisi-Furter-Lamy.
