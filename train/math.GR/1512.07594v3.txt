Let G be a group. The orbits of the natural action of \mbox{Aut}(G) on G are called "automorphism orbits" of G, and the number of automorphism orbits of G is denoted by \omega(G). In this paper the finite nonsolvable groups G with \omega(G) \leq 6 are classified - this solves a problem posed by Markus Stroppel - and it is proved that there are infinitely many finite nonsolvable groups G with \omega(G)=7. Moreover it is proved that for a given number n there are only finitely many finite groups G without nontrivial abelian normal subgroups and such that \omega(G) \leq n, generalizing a result of Kohl.
