We study isometric actions of Steinberg groups on Hadamard manifolds. We prove some rigidity properties related to these actions. In Particular we show that every isometric action of St_n(F_p\langle t_1,\ldots ,t_k \rangle) on Hadamard manifold when n \geq 3 is finite. We further study actions on infinite dimensional manifolds and prove a fixed point theorem related to such actions.
