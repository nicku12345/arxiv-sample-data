We say that the weak width of an infinite subgroup H of G in G is n if there exists a collection of n strongly essentially distinct conjugates   \{ H, g_1^{-1} H g_1,\cdots, g_{n-1}^{-1} H g_{n-1} \} of H in G such that the intersection H \cap g_i^{-1} H g_i is infinite for all 1 \leq i \leq n-1 and n is maximal possible. We prove that a quasiconvex subgroup of a negatively curved group has finite weak width in the ambient group. We also give examples demonstrating that height, width, and weak width are different invariants of a subgroup.
