The prime graph of a finite group G is denoted by \ga(G) whose vertex set is \pi(G) and two distinct primes p and q are adjacent in \ga(G), whenever G contains an element with order pq. We say that G is unrecognizable by prime graph if there is a finite group H with \ga(H)=\ga(G), in while H\not\cong G. In this paper, we consider finite groups with the same prime graph as the almost simple group \textrm{PGL}(2,49). Moreover, we construct some Frobenius groups whose their prime graph coincide with \ga(\textrm{PGL}(2,49)), in particular, we get that \textrm{PGL}(2,49) is unrecognizable by prime graph.
