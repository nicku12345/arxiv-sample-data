Let M be a locally symmetric irreducible closed manifold of dimension \ge 3. A result of Borel [Bo] combined with Mostow rigidity imply that there exists a finite group G = G(M) such that any finite subgroup of \text{Homeo}^+(M) is isomorphic to a subgroup of G. Borel [Bo] asked if there exist M's with G(M) trivial and if the number of conjugacy classes of finite subgroups of \text{Homeo}^+(M) is finite. We answer both questions: (1) For every finite group G there exist M's with G(M) = G, and (2) the number of maximal subgroups of \text{Homeo}^+(M) can be either one, countably many or continuum and we determine (at least for \dim M \neq 4) when each case occurs. Our detailed analysis of (2) also gives a complete characterization of the topological local rigidity and topological strong rigidity (for dimM\neq 4) of proper discontinuous actions of uniform lattices in semisimple Lie groups on the associated symmetric spaces.
