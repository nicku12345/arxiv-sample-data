For a finite group G, the proper power graph \mathscr{P}^*(G) of G is the graph whose vertices are non-trivial elements of G and two vertices u and v are adjacent if and only if u \neq v and u^m=v or v^m=u for some positive integer m. In this paper, we consider the complement of \mathscr{P}^*(G), denoted by {\overline{\mathscr{P}^*(G)}}. We classify all finite groups whose complement of proper power graphs is complete, bipartite, a path, a cycle, a star, claw-free, triangle-free, disconnected, planar, outer-planar, toroidal, or projective. Among the other results, we also determine the diameter and girth of the complement of proper power graphs of finite groups.
