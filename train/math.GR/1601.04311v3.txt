There are various results in the literature which are part of the general philosophy that a finite group for which a certain parameter (for example, the number of conjugacy classes or the maximum number of elements inverted, squared or cubed by a single automorphism) is large enough must be close to being abelian. In this paper, we show the following: Fix a real number \rho with 0<\rho\leq 1. Then a finite group G with an automorphism inverting or squaring at least \rho|G| of the elements in G is "almost abelian" in the sense that both the index and the derived length of the solvable radical of G are bounded. Furthermore, if G has an automorphism cubing at least \rho|G| of the elements in G, then G is "almost solvable" in the sense that the index of the solvable radical of G is bounded.
