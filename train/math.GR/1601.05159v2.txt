The decomposition \Gamma=BH of a group \Gamma into a subset B and a subgroup H of \Gamma induces, under general conditions, a group-like structure for B, known as a gyrogroup. The famous concrete realization of a gyrogroup, which motivated the emergence of gyrogroups into the mainstream, is the space of all relativistically admissible velocities along with a binary operation given by the Einstein velocity addition law of special relativity theory. The latter leads to the Lorentz transformation group \mathrm{SO}(1,n), n\in\mathbb{N}, in pseudo-Euclidean spaces of signature (1, n). The study in this article is motivated by generalized Lorentz groups \mathrm{SO}(m, n), m, n\in\mathbb{N}, in pseudo-Euclidean spaces of signature (m, n). Accordingly, this article explores the bi-decomposition \Gamma = H_LBH_R of a group \Gamma into a subset B and subgroups H_L and H_R of \Gamma, along with the novel bi-gyrogroup structure of B induced by the bi-decomposition of \Gamma. As an example, we show by methods of Clifford algebras that the quotient group of the spin group \mathrm{spin}(m, n) possesses the bi-decomposition structure.
