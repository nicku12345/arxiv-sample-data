Let m,n be positive integers and p a prime. We denote by \nu(G) an extension of the non-abelian tensor square G \otimes G by G \times G. We prove that if G is a residually finite group satisfying some non-trivial identity f \equiv~1 and for every x,y \in G there exists a p-power q=q(x,y) such that [x,y^{\varphi}]^q = 1, then the derived subgroup \nu(G)' is locally finite (Theorem A). Moreover, we show that if G is a residually finite group in which for every x,y \in G there exists a p-power q=q(x,y) dividing p^m such that [x,y^{\varphi}]^q is left n-Engel, then the non-abelian tensor square G \otimes G is locally virtually nilpotent (Theorem B).
