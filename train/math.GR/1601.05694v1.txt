For any group G and set A, a cellular automaton over G and A is a transformation \tau : A^G \to A^G defined via a finite neighborhood S \subseteq G (called a memory set of \tau) and a local function \mu : A^S \to A. In this paper, we assume that G and A are both finite and study various algebraic properties of the finite monoid \text{CA}(G,A) consisting of all cellular automata over G and A. Let \text{ICA}(G;A) be the group of invertible cellular automata over G and A. In the first part, using information on the conjugacy classes of subgroups of G, we give a detailed description of the structure of \text{ICA}(G;A) in terms of direct and wreath products. In the second part, we study generating sets of \text{CA}(G;A). In particular, we prove that \text{CA}(G,A) cannot be generated by cellular automata with small memory set, and, when G is finite abelian, we determine the minimal size of a set V \subseteq \text{CA}(G;A) such that \text{CA}(G;A) = \langle \text{ICA}(G;A) \cup V \rangle.
