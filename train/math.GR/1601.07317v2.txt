In 'The essentially chief series of a compactly generated locally compact group', an analogue of chief series for finite groups is discovered for compactly generated locally compact groups. In the present article, we show that chief factors necessarily exist in all locally compact groups with sufficiently rich topological structure. We also show that chief factors have one of seven types, and for all but one of these types, there is a decomposition into discrete groups, compact groups, and topologically simple groups.   Our results for chief factors require exploring the theory developed in 'Chief factors in Polish groups' in the setting of locally compact groups. In this context, we obtain tighter restrictions on the factorization of normal compressions and the structure of quasi-products. Consequently, both (non-)amenability and elementary decomposition rank are preserved by normal compressions.
