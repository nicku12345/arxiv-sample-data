Let G be a countable group, \operatorname{Sub}(G) the (compact, metric) space of all subgroups of G with the Chabauty topology and \operatorname{Is}(G) \subset \operatorname{Sub}(G) the collection of isolated points. We denote by X! the (Polish) group of all permutations of a countable set X. Then the following properties are equivalent: (i) \operatorname{Is}(G) is dense in \operatorname{Sub}(G), (ii) G admits a "generic permutation representation". Namely there exists some \tau^* \in \operatorname{Hom}(G,X!) such that the collection of permutation representations \{\phi \in \operatorname{Hom}(G,X!) \ | \ \phi {\text{is permutation isomorphic to}} \tau^*\} is co-meager in \operatorname{Hom}(G,X!). We call groups satisfying these properties solitary. Examples of solitary groups include finitely generated LERF groups and groups with countably many subgroups.
