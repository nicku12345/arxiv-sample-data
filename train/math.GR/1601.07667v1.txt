The class of all quasigroups is covered by six classes: the class of all asymmetric quasigroups and five varieties of quasigroups (commutative, left symmetric, right symmetric, semi-symmetric and totally symmetric). Each of these classes is characterized by symmetry groups of its quasigroups.   In this article, criteria of belonging of group isotopes to each of these classes are found, including the corollaries for linear, medial and central quasigroups etc. It is established that an isotope of a noncommutative group is either semi-symmetric or asymmetric, each non-medial T-quasigroup is asymmetric etc. The obtained results are applied for the classification of linear group isotopes of prime orders, taking into account their up to isomorphism description.
