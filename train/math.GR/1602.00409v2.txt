Let \Omega be a finite symmetric subset of GL_n(\mathbb{Z}[1/q_0]), and \Gamma:=\langle \Omega \rangle. Then the family of Cayley graphs \{{\rm Cay}(\pi_m(\Gamma),\pi_m(\Omega))\}_m is a family of expanders as m ranges over fixed powers of square-free integers and powers of primes that are coprime to q_0 if and only if the connected component of the Zariski-closure of \Gamma is perfect. Some of the immediate applications, e.g. orbit equivalence rigidity, {\em largeness} of certain \ell-adic Galois representations, are also discussed.
