We develop a practical method for computing local zeta functions of groups, algebras, and modules in fortunate cases. Using our method, we obtain a complete classification of generic local representation zeta functions associated with unipotent algebraic groups of dimension at most six. We also determine the generic local subalgebra zeta functions associated with \mathfrak{gl}_2(\mathbf{Q}). Finally, we introduce and compute examples of graded subobject zeta functions.
