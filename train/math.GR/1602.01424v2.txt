We describe the structure of Sylow {\ell}-subgroups of a finite reduc-tive group G(Fq) when q \not\equiv 0 (mod {\ell}) that we find governed by a complex reflection group attached to G and {\ell}, which depends on {\ell} only through the set of cyclotomic factors of the generic order of G(Fq) whose value at q is divisible by {\ell}. We also tackle the more general case G F where F is an isogeny whose a power is a Frobenius morphism.
