Let G  be a group of cardinality \kappa>\aleph_0  endowed with a topology \tau  such that |U|=\kappa for every non-empty U\in\tau and \tau has a base of cardinality \kappa. We prove that G could be factorized G=AB (i.e. each g\in G has unique representation g=ab, a\in A, b\in B) into dense subsets A,B, |A|=|B|=\kappa. We do not know if this statement holds for \kappa = \aleph_0 even if G is a topological group.
