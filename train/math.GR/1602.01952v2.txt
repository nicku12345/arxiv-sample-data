We consider a finitely generated virtually abelian group G acting properly and without inversions on a CAT(0) cube complex X. We prove that G stabilizes a finite dimensional CAT(0) subcomplex Y \subseteq X that is isometrically embedded in the combinatorial metric. Moreover, we show that Y is a product of finitely many quasilines. The result represents a higher dimensional generalization of Haglund's axis theorem.
