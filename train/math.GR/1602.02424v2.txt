We introduce the concept of an extension of a semilattice of groups A by a group G and describe all the extensions of this type which are equivalent to the crossed products A*_\Theta G by twisted partial actions \Theta of G on A. As a consequence, we establish a one-to-one correspondence, up to an isomorphism, between twisted partial actions of groups on semilattices of groups and so-called Sieben twisted modules over E-unitary inverse semigroups.
