Given a set X, the group \mathrm{Sym}(X) consists of all bijections from X to X, and \mathrm{FSym}(X) is the subgroup of maps with finite support i.e. those that move only finitely many points in X. We describe the automorphism structure of groups \mathrm{FSym}(X)\le G\le \mathrm{Sym}(X) and use this to state some conditions on G for it to have the R_\infty property. Our main results are that if G is infinite, torsion, and \mathrm{FSym}(X)\le G\le \mathrm{Sym}(X), then it has the R_\infty property. Also, if G is infinite and residually finite, then there is a set X such that G acts faithfully on X and, using this action, \langle G, \mathrm{FSym}(X)\rangle has the R_\infty property. Finally we have a result for the Houghton groups, which are a family of groups we denote H_n, where n \in \mathbb{N}. We show that, given any n\in \mathbb{N}, any group commensurable to H_n has the R_\infty property.
