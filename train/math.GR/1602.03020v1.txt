This paper deals with the reducibility property of semidirect products of the form \bf V*\bf D relatively to graph equation systems, where \bf D denotes the pseudovariety of definite semigroups. We show that, if the pseudovariety \bf V is reducible with respect to the canonical signature \kappa consisting of the multiplication and the (\omega-1)-power, then \bf V*\bf D is also reducible with respect to \kappa.
