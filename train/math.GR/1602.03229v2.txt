A group G is called subgroup conjugacy separable (abbreviated as SCS) if any two finitely generated and non-conjugate subgroups of G remain non-conjugate in some finite quotient of G. An into-conjugacy version of SCS is abbreviated by SICS. We prove that if G is a hyperbolic group, H_1 is a quasiconvex subgroup of G, and H_2 is a subgroup of G which is elementwise conjugate into H_1, then there exists a finite index subgroup of H_2 which is conjugate into H_1. As corollary, we deduce that fundamental groups of closed hyperbolic 3-manifolds and torsion-free small cancellation groups with finite C'(1/6) or C'(1/4)-T(4) presentations are hereditarily quasiconvex-SCS and hereditarily quasiconvex-SICS, and that surface groups are SCS and SICS. We also show that the word "quasiconvex" cannot be deleted for at least small cancellation groups.
