First we give a new proof of Goto's theorem for Lie algebras of compact semisimple Lie groups using Coxeter transformations. Namely, every x in L = \operatorname{Lie}(G) can be written as x =[a, b] for some a, b in L. By using the same method, we give a new proof of the following theorem (thus avoiding the classification tables of fundamental weights): in compact semisimple Lie algebras, orthogonal Cartan subalgebras always exist (where one of them can be chosen arbitrarily). Some of the consequences of this theorem are the following. (i) If L=\operatorname{Lie}(G) is such a Lie algebra and C is any Cartan subalgebra of L, then the G-orbit of C^{\perp} is all of L. (ii) The consequence in part (i) answers a question by L. Florit and W. Ziller on fatness of certain principal bundles. It also shows that in our case, the commutator map L \times L \to L is open at (0, 0). (iii) given any regular element x of L, there exists a regular element y such that L = [x, L] + [y,L] and x, y are orthogonal. Then we generalize this result about compact semisimple Lie algebras to the class of non-Hermitian real semisimple Lie algebras having full rank.   Finally, we survey some recent related results , and construct explicitly orthogonal Cartan subalgebras in \mathfrak{su}(n), \mathfrak{sp}(n), \mathfrak{so}(n).
