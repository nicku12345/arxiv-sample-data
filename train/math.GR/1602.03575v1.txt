This article is an expanded version of the talks given by the authors at the Arbeitsgemeinschaft "Totally Disconnected Groups", held at Oberwolfach in October 2014. We recall the basic theory of automorphisms of trees and Tits' simplicity theorem, and present two constructions of tree groups via local actions with their basic properties: the universal group associated to a finite permutation group by M. Burger and S. Mozes, and the k-closures of a given group by C. Banks, M. Elder and G. Willis.
