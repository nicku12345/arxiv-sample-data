Normal residual finiteness growth measures how well a finitely generated group is approximated by its finite quotients. We show that any linear group \Gamma \leq \mathrm{GL}_d(K) has normal residual finiteness growth asymptotically bounded above by (n\log n)^{d^2-1}; notably this bound depends only on the degree of linearity of \Gamma. We also give precise asymptotics in the case that \Gamma is a subgroup of a higher rank Chevalley group G and compute the non-normal residual finiteness growth in these cases. In particular, finite index subgroups of G(\mathbb{Z}) and G(\mathbb{F}_p[t]) have normal residual finiteness growth n^{\dim(G)}.
