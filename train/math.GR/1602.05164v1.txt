We use M\"uller and Nagy's method of contradicting subsets to give a new proof for the non-existence of sharply 2-transitive subsets of the symplectic groups \mathrm{Sp}(2d,2) in their doubly-transitive actions of degrees 2^{2d-1}\pm 2^{d-1}. The original proof by Grundh\"ofer and M\"uller was rather complicated and used some results from modular representation theory, whereas our new proof requires only simple counting arguments.
