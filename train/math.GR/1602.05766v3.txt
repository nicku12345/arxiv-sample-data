A countable graph is ultrahomogeneous if every isomorphism between finite induced subgraphs can be extended to an automorphism. Woodrow and Lachlan showed that there are essentially four types of such countably infinite graphs: the random graph; infinite disjoint unions of complete graphs K_n with n\in \mathbb{N} vertices; the K_n-free graphs; finite unions of the infinite complete graph K_{\omega}; and duals of such graphs. The groups \operatorname{Aut}(\Gamma) of automorphisms of such graphs \Gamma have a natural topology, which is compatible with multiplication and inversion, i.e.\ the groups \operatorname{Aut}(\Gamma) are topological groups. We consider the problem of finding minimally generated dense subgroups of the groups \operatorname{Aut}(\Gamma) where \Gamma is ultrahomogeneous. We show that if \Gamma is ultrahomogeneous, then \operatorname{Aut}(\Gamma) has 2-generated dense subgroups, and that under certain conditions given f \in \operatorname{Aut}(\Gamma) there exists g\in \operatorname{Aut}(\Gamma) such that the subgroup generated by f and g is dense. We also show that, roughly speaking, g can be chosen with a high degree of freedom. For example, if \Gamma is either an infinite disjoint unions of K_n or a finite union of K_{\omega}, then g can be chosen to have any given finite set of orbit representatives.
