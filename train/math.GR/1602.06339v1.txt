Malcev described the congruences of the monoid T_n of all full transformations on a finite set X_n=\{1, \dots,n\}. Since then, congruences have been characterized in various other monoids of (partial) transformations on X_n, such as the symmetric inverse monoid In_n of all injective partial transformations, or the monoid PT_n of all partial transformations.   The first aim of this paper is to describe the congruences of the direct products Q_m\times P_n, where Q and P belong to \{T, PT,In\}.   Malcev also provided a similar description of the congruences on the multiplicative monoid F_n of all n\times n matrices with entries in a field F, our second aim is provide a description of the principal congruences of F_m \times F_n.   The paper finishes with some comments on the congruences of products of more than two transformation semigroups, and a fairly large number of open problems.
