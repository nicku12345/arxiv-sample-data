Let \mathbb{N}^{2}_{\leqslant} be the set \mathbb{N}^{2} with the partial order defined as the product of usual order \leq on the set of positive integers \mathbb{N}. We study the semigroup \mathscr{P\!O}\!_{\infty}(\mathbb{N}^2_{\leqslant}) of monotone injective partial selfmaps of \mathbb{N}^{2}_{\leqslant} having cofinite domain and image. We describe properties of elements of the semigroup \mathscr{P\!O}\!_{\infty}(\mathbb{N}^2_{\leqslant}) as monotone partial bijections of \mathbb{N}^{2}_{\leqslant} and show that the group of units of \mathscr{P\!O}\!_{\infty}(\mathbb{N}^2_{\leqslant}) is isomorphic to the cyclic group of order two. Also we describe the subsemigroup of idempotents of \mathscr{P\!O}\!_{\infty}(\mathbb{N}^2_{\leqslant}) and the Green relations on \mathscr{P\!O}\!_{\infty}(\mathbb{N}^2_{\leqslant}). In particular, we show that \mathscr{D}=\mathscr{J} in \mathscr{P\!O}\!_{\infty}(\mathbb{N}^2_{\leqslant}).
