The theory of rough sets was firstly introduced by Pawlak (see \cite{p}). Many Mathematician has been studied the relations between rough sets and algebraic systems such as groups, rings and modules. In this paper we will introduce the lower and upper approximations in a quotient group. We will discuss several properties of the lower and upper approximations. Moreover under some additional assumptions we are able to show that the lower approximation is a normal subgroup of the quotient group but this property fails for the upper approximation. At the end we will develop several homomorphisms between lower approximations.
