Let G, H be groups and \kappa be a cardinal. A bijection f:G\to H is caled on asymorphism if, for any X\in[G]^{<\kappa}, Y\in[H]^{<\kappa}, there exist X'\in[G]^{<\kappa}, Y'\in[H]^{<\kappa} such that for all x\in G and y\in H, we have f(Xx)\subseteq Y'f(x), f^{-1}(Yy)\subseteq X'f^{-1}(y). For a set S, [S]^{<\kappa} denotes the set \{S'\subseteq S: |S'|<\kappa\}.   Let \kappa and \gamma be cardinals such that \aleph_0<\kappa\le\gamma. We prove that any two Abelian groups of cardinality \gamma are \kappa-asymorphic, but the free group of rank \gamma is not \kappa-asymorphic to an Abelian group provided that either \kappa<\gamma or \kappa=\gamma and \kappa is a singular cardinal. It is known [7] that if \gamma = \kappa and \kappa is regular then any two groups of cardinality \kappa are \kappa-asymorphic.
