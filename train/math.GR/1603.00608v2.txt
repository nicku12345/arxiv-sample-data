We enumerate three classes of non-medial quasigroups of order 243=3^5 up to isomorphism. There are 17004 non-medial trimedial quasigroups of order 243 (extending the work of Kepka, B\'en\'eteau and Lacaze), 92 non-medial distributive quasigroups of order 243 (extending the work of Kepka and N\v{e}mec), and 6 non-medial distributive Mendelsohn quasigroups of order 243 (extending the work of Donovan, Griggs, McCourt, Opr\v{s}al and Stanovsk\'y).   The enumeration technique is based on affine representations over commutative Moufang loops, on properties of automorphism groups of commutative Moufang loops, and on computer calculations with the \texttt{LOOPS} package in \texttt{GAP}.
