Cross-connection is a construction of regular semigroups using certain categories called normal categories which are abstractions of the partially ordered sets of principal left (right) ideals of a semigroup. We describe the cross-connections in the semigroup Sing(X) of all non-invertible transformations on a set X. The categories involved are characterized as the powerset category \mathscr{P}(X) and the category of partitions \Pi(X). We describe these categories and show how a permutation on X gives rise to a cross-connection. Further we prove that every cross-connection between them is induced by a permutation and construct the regular semigroups that arise from the cross-connections. We show that each of the cross-connection semigroups arising this way is isomorphic to Sing(X). We also describe the right reductive subsemigroups of Sing(X) with the category of principal left ideals isomorphic to \mathscr{P}(X). This study sheds light into the more general theory of cross-connections and also provides an alternate way of studying the structure of Sing(X).
