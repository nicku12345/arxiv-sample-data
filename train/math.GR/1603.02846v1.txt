For a group G of finite Kurosh rank and for some arbiratily free product decomposition of G, G = H_1 \ast H_2 \ast ... \ast H_r \ast F_q, where F_q is a finitely generated free group, we can associate some (relative) outer space \mathcal{O}(G, \{H_1,..., H_r \}). We define the relative boundary \partial (G, \{ H_1, ..., H_r \}) = \partial(G, \mathcal{O})  corresponding to the free product decomposition, as the set of infinite reduced words (with respect to free product length). By denoting Out(G, \{ H_1, ..., H_r \}) the subgroup of Out(G) which is consisted of the outer automorphisms which preserve the set of conjugacy classes of H_i's, we prove that for the stabiliser Stab(X) of an attractive fixed point in X \in \partial (G, \{ H_1, ..., H_r \}) of an irreducible with irreducible powers automorphism relative to \mathcal{O}, it holds that it has a (normal) subgroup B isomorphic to subgroup of \bigoplus \limits_{i=1} ^{r} Out(H_i) such that Stab(X) / B is isomorphic to \mathbb{Z}. The proof relies heavily on the machinery of the attractive lamination of an IWIP automorphism relative to \mathcal{O}.
