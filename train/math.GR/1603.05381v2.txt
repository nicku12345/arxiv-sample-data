We study infinitely iterated wreath products of finite permutation groups with respect to product actions. In particular, we prove that, for every non-empty class of finite simple groups \mathcal{X}, there exists a finitely generated hereditarily just infinite profinite group W with composition factors in \mathcal{X} such that any countably based profinite group with composition factors in \mathcal{X} can be embedded into W. Additionally we investigate when infinitely iterated wreath products of finite simple groups with respect to product actions are co-Hopfian or non-co-Hopfian.
