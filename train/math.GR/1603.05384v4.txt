Let p>3 be a prime. For each maximal subgroup H\leqslant\mathrm{GL}(d,p) with |H| \geqslant p^{3d+1}, we construct a d-generator finite p-group G with the property that \mathrm{Aut}(G) induces H on the Frattini quotient G/\Phi(G) and |G| \leqslant p^{\frac{d^4}{2}}. A significant feature of this construction is that |G| is very small compared to |H|, shedding new light upon a celebrated result of Bryant and Kov\'acs. The groups G that we exhibit have exponent p, and of all such groups G with the desired action of H on G/\Phi(G), the construction yields groups with smallest nilpotency class, and in most cases, the smallest order.
