The authors extend to the q-tensor square G \otimes^q G of a group G, q a non-negative integer, some structural results due to R. D. Blyth, F. Fumagalli and M. Morigi concerning the non-abelian tensor square G \otimes G (q = 0). The results are applied to the computation of G \otimes^q G for finitely generated nilpotent groups G, specially for free nilpotent groups of finite rank. They also generalize to all q \geq 0 results of M. Bacon regarding an upper bound to the minimal number of generators of the non-abelian tensor square G \otimes G when G is a n-generator nilpotent group of class 2. The paper ends with the computation of the q-tensor squares of the free n-generator nilpotent group of class 2, n \geq 2, for all q \geq 0. This shows that the above mentioned upper bound is also achieved for these groups when q > 1.
