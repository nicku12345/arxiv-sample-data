We provide an analogue of Strebel's classification of geodesic triangles in classical C'(\frac16) groups for groups given by Wise's cubical presentations satisfying sufficiently strong metric cubical small cancellation conditions. Using our classification, we prove that, except in specific degenerate cases, such groups are acylindrically hyperbolic.
