We show, using acylindrical hyperbolicity, that a finitely generated group splitting over \Z cannot be simple. We also obtain SQ-universality in most cases, for instance a balanced group (one where if two powers of an infinite order element are conjugate then they are equal or inverse) which is finitely generated and splits over \Z must either be SQ-universal or it is one of exactly seven virtually abelian exceptions.
