We introduce right amenability, right F{\o}lner nets, and right paradoxical decompositions for left homogeneous spaces and prove the Tarski-F{\o}lner theorem for left homogeneous spaces with finite stabilisers. It states that right amenability, the existence of right F{\o}lner nets, and the non-existence of right paradoxical decompositions are equivalent.
