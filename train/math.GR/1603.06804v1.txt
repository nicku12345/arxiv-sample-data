In this article we generalize the theory of subgroup graphs of subgroups of free groups to finite index subgroups H of finitely generated groups G. We study and prove various properties of H in relation to its subgroup graph \Gamma(H). For a finitely generated group G we consider the poset P_{\text{fi}}(G) of all right cosets of all proper finite index subgroups of G. We use the theory of subgroup graphs to prove that for many finitely generated infinite groups the order complex \Delta P_{\text{fi}} (G) and the corresponding nerve complex are contractible.
