Let G be a group. We denote by \nu(G) a certain extension of the non-abelian tensor square G \otimes G by G \times G. We prove that if G is a finitely generated group in which the set of all simple tensors T_{\otimes}(G) is finite, then the non-abelian tensor square G \otimes G and the group \nu(G) are finite. Moreover, we show that if G is a locally residually finite group in which the set of simple tensors T_{\otimes}(H) is finite for every proper finitely generated subgroup H of G, then the group \nu(G) is locally finite.
