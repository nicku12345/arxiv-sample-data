Let \Gamma be a torsion-free hyperbolic group. We study \Gamma--limit groups which, unlike the fundamental case in which \Gamma is free, may not be finitely presentable or geometrically tractable. We define model \Gamma--limit groups, which always have good geometric properties (in particular, they are always relatively hyperbolic). Given a strict resolution of an arbitrary \Gamma--limit group L, we canonically construct a strict resolution of a model \Gamma--limit group, which encodes all homomorphisms L\to \Gamma that factor through the given resolution. We propose this as the correct framework in which to study \Gamma--limit groups algorithmically. We enumerate all \Gamma--limit groups in this framework.
