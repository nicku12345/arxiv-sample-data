If every element of a matrix group is similar to a permutation matrix, then it is called a permutation-like matrix group. References [4], [5] and [6] showed that, if a permutation-like matrix group contains a maximal cycle such that the maximal cycle generates a normal subgroup and the length of the maximal cycle equals to a prime, or a square of a prime, or a power of an odd prime, then the permutation-like matrix group is similar to a permutation matrix group. In this paper, we prove that if a permutation-like matrix group contains a maximal cycle such that the maximal cycle generates a normal subgroup and the length of the maximal cycle equals to any power of 2, then it is similar to a permutation matrix group.
