We present a solution to the Burnside Problem for 2 generator groups of prime-power exponent that does not rely on induced maps as in [2]. As before, we construct a surjective map of a rank 2 free group to a solvable group G and finish by showing that the Burnside group is an image of G. Theorem B in the paper with H. A. Heilbronn and H. Y. Mochizuki [9] is indispensable in the proof.
