We determine exactly which graph products, also known as Right Angled Artin Groups, embed into Richard Thompson's group V. It was shown by Bleak and Salazar-Diaz that \mathbb{Z}^2 * \mathbb{Z} was an obstruction. We show that this is the only obstruction. This is shown by proving a graph theory result giving an alternate description of simple graphs without an appropriate induced subgraph.
