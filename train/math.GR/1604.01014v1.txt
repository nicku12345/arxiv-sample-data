Fix a finite semigroup S and let a_1,\ldots,a_k, b be tuples in a direct power S^n. The subpower membership problem (SMP) for S asks whether b can be generated by a_1,\ldots,a_k. For bands (idempotent semigroups), we provide a dichotomy result: if a band S belongs to a certain quasivariety, then SMP(S) is in P; otherwise it is NP-complete.   Furthermore we determine the greatest variety of bands all of whose finite members induce a tractable SMP. Finally we present the first example of two finite algebras that generate the same variety and have tractable and NP-complete SMPs, respectively.
