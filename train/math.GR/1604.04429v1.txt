In 1997, John Conway constructed a 6-fold transitive subset M_{13} of permutations on a set of size 13 for which the subset fixing any given point was isomorphic to the Mathieu group M_{12}. The construction was via a "moving-counter puzzle" on the projective plane {\rm PG}(2,3). We discuss consequences and generalisations of Conway's construction. In particular we explore how various designs and hypergraphs can be used instead of {\rm PG}(2,3) to obtain interesting analogues of M_{13}; we refer to these analogues as Conway groupoids. A number of open questions are presented.
