We prove here that with a very small number of exceptions, when G is a sporadic simple group and p is a prime such that the Sylow p-subgroups of G are nonabelian, then Out(G) is isomorphic to the outer automorphism groups of the fusion and linking systems of G. In particular, the p-fusion system of G is tame in the sense of [AOV1], and is tamely realized by G itself except when G\cong M_{11} and p=2. From the point of view of homotopy theory, these results also imply that Out(G)\cong Out(BG^\wedge_p) in many (but not all) cases.
