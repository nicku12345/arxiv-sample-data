Let G be a locally compact topological group, G_0 the connected component of its identity element, and comp(G) the union of all compact subgroups. A topological group will be called inductively monothetic if any subgroup generated (as a topological group) by finitely many elements is generated (as a topological group) by a single element. The space SUB(G) of all closed subgroups of G carries a compact Hausdorff topology called the Chabauty topology. Let F_1(G), respectively, R_1(G), denote the subspace of all discrete subgroups isomorphic to \mathbb Z, respectively, all subgroups isomorphic to \mathbb R. It is shown that a necessary and sufficient condition for G\in\overline{F_1(G)} to hold is that G is abelian, and either that G\cong \mathbb R\times {\rm comp}(G) and G/G_0 is inductively monothetic, or else that G is discrete and isomorphic to a subgroup of \mathbb Q. It is further shown that a necessary and sufficient condition for G\in\overline{R_1(G)} to hold is that G\cong\mathbb R\times C for a compact connected abelian group C.
