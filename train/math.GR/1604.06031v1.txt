We prove a conjecture of Boston that if p\geq 5, all p-central quotients of the free group on two generators and of the free product of two cyclic groups of order p are Beauville groups. In the case of the free product, we also determine Beauville structures in p-central quotients when p=3. As a consequence, we give an explicit infinite family of Beauville 3-groups, which is different from the only one that was known up to date.
