For a finite noncyclic group G, let \Cyc(G) be a set of elements a of G such that \langle a,b\rangle is cyclic for each b of G. The noncyclic graph of G is a graph with the vertex set G\setminus \Cyc(G), having an edge between two distinct vertices x and y if \langle x, y\rangle is not cyclic. In this paper, we classify all finite noncyclic groups whose noncyclic graphs are K_{1,n}-free, where 3\leq n\leq 6.
