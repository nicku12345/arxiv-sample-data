In this paper, we initiate the study of spectrum of the commuting graphs of finite non-abelian groups. We first compute the spectrum of this graph for several classes of finite groups, in particular AC-groups. We show that the commuting graphs of finite non-abelian AC-groups are integral. We also show that the commuting graph of a finite non-abelian group G is integral if G is not isomorphic to the symmetric group of degree 4 and the commuting graph of G is planar. Further it is shown that the commuting graph of G is integral if the commuting graph of G is toroidal.
