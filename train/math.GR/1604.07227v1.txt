In this paper, an alternate module (A,\phi) is a finite abelian group A with a \mathbb{Z}-bilinear application \phi:A\times A\rightarrow \mathbb{Q}/\mathbb{Z} which is alternate (i.e. zero on the diagonal). We shall prove that any alternate module is subsymplectic, i.e. if (A,\phi) has a Lagrangian of cardinal n then there exists an abelian group B of order n such that (A,\phi) is a submodule of the standard symplectic module B\times B^*.
