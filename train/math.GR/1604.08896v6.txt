Let G \simeq M \rtimes C be an n-generator group with M Abelian and C cyclic. We study the Nielsen equivalence classes and T-systems of generating n-tuples of G. The subgroup M can be turned into a finitely generated faithful module over a suitable quotient R of the integral group ring of C. When C is infinite, we show that the Nielsen equivalence classes of the generating n-tuples of G correspond bijectively to the orbits of unimodular rows in M^{n -1} under the action of a subgroup of GL_{n - 1}(R). Making no assumption on the cardinality of C, we exhibit a complete invariant of Nielsen equivalence in the case M \simeq R. As an application, we classify Nielsen equivalence classes and T-systems of soluble Baumslag-Solitar groups, lamplighter groups and split metacyclic groups.
