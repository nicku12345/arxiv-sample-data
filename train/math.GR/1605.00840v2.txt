Let V_r(\Sigma) be the generalised Thompson group defined as the automorphism group of a valid, bounded, and complete Cantor algebra. We show that that for every n>0 there is a k>n, such that there exists a k-dimensional n-connected simplicial complex K such that V_r(\Sigma) acts on K with finite stabilisers. We also determine the number of conjugacy classes of finite cyclic subgroups of a given order m in Brin-Thompson groups. We apply our computations to the rationalised Farrell-Jones assembly map in algebraic K-theory.
