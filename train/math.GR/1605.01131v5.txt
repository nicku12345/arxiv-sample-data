We study the HNN extension of \mathbb{Z}^m given by the cubing endomorphism g\mapsto g^3, and prove that such groups have rational growth. To do so, we describe a method of computing the subgroup growth series of the horocyclic subgroup \mathbb{Z}^m in this family of examples, prove that for all m the group has rational growth. In the appendix, the subgroup growth series has been computed for all m \leq 10.
