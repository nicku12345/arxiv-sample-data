Two elements in a group G are said to z-equivalent or to be in the same z-class if their centralizers are conjugate in G. In \cite{kkj}, it was proved that a non-abelian p-group G can have at most \frac{p^k-1}{p-1} +1 number of z-classes, where |G/Z(G)|=p^k. In this note, we characterize the p-groups of conjugate type (n,1) attaining this maximal number. As a corollary, we characterize p-groups having prime order commutator subgroup and maximal number of z-classes.
