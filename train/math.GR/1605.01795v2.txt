Suppose that a finitely generated group G is hyperbolic relative to a collection of subgroups \mathbb{P}=\{P_1,\dots,P_m\}. Let H_1,H_2 be subgroups of G such that H_1 is relatively quasiconvex with respect to \mathbb{P} and H_2 is not parabolic. Suppose that H_2 is elementwise conjugate into H_1. Then there exists a finite index subgroup of H_2 which is conjugate into H_1. The minimal length of the conjugator can be estimated. In the case where G is a limit group, it is sufficient to assume only that H_1 is a finitely generated and H_2 is an arbitrary subgroup of G.
