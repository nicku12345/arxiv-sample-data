Let G be a non-abelian p-group of order p^n and M(G) be its Schur multiplier. It is well known result by Green that |M(G)| \leq p^{\frac{1}{2}n(n-1)}. So |M(G)|= p^{\frac{1}{2}n(n-1)-t(G)} for some t(G) \geq 0. The groups has already been classified for t(G) \leq 5 by several authors. For t(G)=6 the classification has been done. In this paper we classify p-groups G for t(G) = 6 in different method.
