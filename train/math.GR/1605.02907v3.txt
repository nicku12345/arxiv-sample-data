Let p\ge 3 be a prime. A generalised multi-edge spinal group is a subgroup of the automorphism group of a regular p-adic rooted tree T that is generated by one rooted automorphism and p families of directed automorphisms, each family sharing a common directed path disjoint from the paths of the other families.   This notion generalises the concepts of multi-edge spinal groups, including the widely studied GGS-groups, and the extended Gupta-Sidki groups that were introduced by Pervova. Extending techniques that were developed in these more special cases, we prove: generalised multi-edge spinal groups that are torsion have no maximal subgroups of infinite index. Furthermore we use tree enveloping algebras, which were introduced by Sidki and Bartholdi, to show that certain generalised multi-edge spinal groups admit faithful infinite dimensional irreducible representations over the prime field \mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}.
