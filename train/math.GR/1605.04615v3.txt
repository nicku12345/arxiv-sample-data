Aschbacher's program for the classification of simple fusion systems of "odd" type at the prime 2 has two main stages: the classification of 2-fusion systems of subintrinsic component type and the classification of 2-fusion systems of J-component type. We make a contribution to the latter stage by classifying 2-fusion systems with a J-component isomorphic to the 2-fusion systems of several sporadic groups under the assumption that the centralizer of such a component is cyclic.
