We will prove the following theorems. The first theorem posits the existence of a fixed point for the actions of nilpotent Lie groups on nonpositively curved compact manifolds. The second theorem states that actions of solvable Lie groups on nonpositively curved compact manifolds have either a fixed point or a 2-periodic point.
