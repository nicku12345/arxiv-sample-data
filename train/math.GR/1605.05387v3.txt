We study subgroups H_U of the R. Thompson group F which are stabilizers of finite sets U of numbers in the interval (0,1). We describe the algebraic structure of H_U and prove that the stabilizer H_U is finitely generated if and only if U consists of rational numbers. We also show that such subgroups are isomorphic surprisingly often. In particular, we prove that if finite sets U\subset [0,1] and V\subset [0,1] consist of rational numbers which are not finite binary fractions, and |U|=|V|, then the stabilizers of U and V are isomorphic. In fact these subgroups are conjugate inside a subgroup \bar F<\Homeo([0,1]) which is the completion of F with respect to what we call the Hamming metric on F. Moreover the conjugator can be found in a certain subgroup \F < \bar F which consists of possibly infinite tree-diagrams with finitely many infinite branches. We also show that the group \F is non-amenable.
