In "Frobenius Categories versus Brauer Blocks" we have proved some universality of the so-called localizing functor associated with a Frobenius P-category F, where P is a finite p-group, with respect to the coherent F-localities (\tau,L,\pi) such that the contravariant functor Ker (\pi) maps any subgroup of P to an Abelian p-group. The purpose of this Note is both to move from the localizing functor to the perfect locality associated with F and to remove the Abelian hypothesis in the target. As a consequence, we get the functoriality for the perfect localities in the strongest form, improving the Theorem 9.15 in "Existence, uniqueness and functoriality of the perfect locality over a Frobenius P-category".
