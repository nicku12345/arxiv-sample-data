We complete the computation of the integral homology of the generalized braid group B associated to an arbitrary irreducible complex reflection group W of exceptional type. In order to do this we explicitely computed the recursively-defined differential of a resolution of \mathbf{Z} as a \mathbf{Z} B-module, using parallel computing. We also deduce from this general computation the rational homology of the Milnor fiber of the singularity attached to most of these reflection groups.
