The main result of this paper is an algorithmic answer to the question raised in the title, up to replacing the given \hat{\phi} \in Out(F_n) by a positive power.   In order to provide this algorithm, it is shown that every polynomially growing automorphism \hat \phi can be represented by an iterated Dehn twist on some graph-of-groups \cal{G} with \pi_1{\cal{G}} = F_n. One then uses results of two previous papers \cite{KY01, KY02} as well as some classical results such as the Whitehead algorithm to prove the claim.
