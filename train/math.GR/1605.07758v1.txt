Let G be a connected exponential Lie group and R be the solvable radical of G. We describe a condition on G/R under which one can then conclude that R is an exponential Lie group. The condition holds in particular when G is a complex Lie group and this yields a stronger version of a result of Moskowitz and Sacksteder \cite{MS} on the center of a complex exponential Lie group being connected. Along the way we prove a criterion for elements from certain subsets of a solvable Lie group to be exponential, which would be of independent interest.
