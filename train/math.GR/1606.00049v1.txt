The main aim of this article is to study quantitative structure of small Ree Groups ^{2}G_{2}(q). Here, we prove that small Ree groups are uniquely determined by their orders and the set of the number of elements of the same order. As a consequence, we give a positive answer to J. G. Thompson's problem for simple groups ^{2}G_{2}(q).
