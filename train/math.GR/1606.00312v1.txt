Let (\Omega, \leq) be a totally ordered set. We prove that if \Aut(\Omega,\leq) is transitive and satisfies the same first-order sentences as \Aut(\RR,\leq) (in the language of lattice-ordered groups) then \Omega and \RR are isomorphic ordered sets. This improvement of a theorem of Gurevich and Holland is obtained as one of many consequences of a study of centralizers and coloured chains associated with certain transitive subgroups of \Aut(\Omega,\leq).
