We show that for a finite group G, the commuting probability of G can be explicitly bounded from below in a nontrivial way by a function in the maximum fraction of elements inverted resp. squared by an automorphism of G. Using these bounds together with a result of Guralnick and Robinson gives upper bounds on the index of the Fitting subgroup of G under each of the two conditions that G have an automorphism inverting resp. squaring at least \rho|G| many elements in G, for \rho\in\left(0,1\right] fixed. This is an improvement on previous results of the author.
