Let G be a finite p-group of order p^n with |G'| = p^k. Let M(G) denotes the Schur multiplier of G. A classical result of Green states that |M(G)| \leq p^{\frac{1}{2}n(n-1)}. In 2009, Niroomand, improving Green's and other bounds on |M(G)| for a non-abelain p-group G, proved that |M(G)| \leq p^{\frac{1}{2}(n-k-1)(n+k-2)+1}. In this article we note that a bound, obtained earlier, by Ellis and Weigold is more general than the bound of Niroomand. We derive from the bound of Ellis and Weigold that |M(G)| \leq p^{\frac{1}{2}(d(G)-1)(n+k-2)+1} for a non-abelain p-group G. Moreover, we sharpen the bound of Ellis and Weigold and as a consequence derive that if G^{ab} is not homocyclic then |M(G)| \leq p^{\frac{1}{2}(d(G)-1)(n+k-3)+1}. We further note an improvement in an old bound given by Vermani. Finally we note, for a p-group of coclass r, that |M(G)| \leq p^{\frac{1}{2}(r^2-r)+kr+1}. This improves a bound by Moravec.
