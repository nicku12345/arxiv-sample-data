Let G be a finite group, p a prime and P a Sylow p-subgroup of G. In this note we give a cohomological criterion for the p-solvability of G depending on the cohomology in degree 1 with coefficients in \mathbb F_p of both the normal subgroups of G and P. As a byproduct we bound the minimal number of quotients of order a power of p appearing in any normal series of G by the number of generators of P.
