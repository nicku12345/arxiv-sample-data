Since the work of Jennings (1955), it is well-known that any finitely generated torsion-free nilpotent group can be embedded into unitriangular integer matrices UT_N(Z) for some N. In 2006, Nickel proposed an algorithm to calculate such embeddings. In this work, we show that if UT_n(Z) is embedded into UT_N(Z) using Nickel's algorithm, then N \geq 2^{n/2 -2} if the standard ordering of the Mal'cev basis (as in Nickel's original paper) is used. In particular, we establish an exponential worst-case running time of Nickel's algorithm.   On the other hand, we also prove a general exponential upper bound on the dimension of the embedding by showing that for any torsion free, finitely generated nilpotent group the matrix representation produced by Nickel's algorithm has never larger dimension than Jennings' embedding. Moreover, when starting with a special Mal'cev basis, Nickel's embedding for UT_n(Z) has only quadratic size. Finally, we consider some special cases like free nilpotent groups and Heisenberg groups and compare the sizes of the embeddings.
