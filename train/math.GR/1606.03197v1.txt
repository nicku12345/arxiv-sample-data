Let \sigma =\{\sigma_{i} | i\in I\} be some partition of the set of all primes \Bbb{P} and \Pi a non-empty subset of the set \sigma. A set {\cal H} of subgroups of a finite group G is said to be a \emph{ complete Hall \Pi -set} of G if every member of {\cal H} is a Hall \sigma_{i}-subgroup of G for some \sigma_{i}\in \Pi and {\cal H} contains exact one Hall \sigma_{i}-subgroup of G for every \sigma_{i}\in \Pi such that \sigma_i\cap \pi(G)\neq\emptyset. A subgroup H of G is called \emph{\Pi-quasinormal} or \emph{\Pi-permutable} in G if G possesses a complete Hall \Pi-set   {\cal H}=\{H_{1}, \ldots , H_{t} \} such that AH_{i}^{x}=H_{i}^{x}A for any i and all x\in G. We study the embedding properties of H under the hypothesis that H is \Pi-permutable in G. Some known results are generalized.
