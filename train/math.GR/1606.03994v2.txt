We apply the framework of Rosendal to study the large-scale geometry of the topological groups \Diff_+^k(M^1), consisting of orientation-preserving C^k-diffeomorphisms (for 1\leq k\leq\infty) of a compact 1-manifold M^1 (=I or \mathbb{S}^1). We characterize the relative property (OB) in such groups: A\subseteq\Diff_+^k(M^1) has property (OB) relative to \Diff_+^k(M^1) if and only if \displaystyle\sup_{f\in A}\sup_{x\in M^1}|\log f'(x)|<\infty and \displaystyle\sup_{f\in A}\sup_{x\in M^1}|f^{(j)}(x)|<\infty for every integer 2\leq j\leq k. We deduce that \Diff_+^k(M^1) has the local property (OB), and consequently a well-defined non-trivial quasi-isometry class, if and only if k<\infty. We show that the groups \Diff_+^1(I) and \Diff_+^1(\mathbb{S}^1) are quasi-isometric to the infinite-dimensional Banach space C[0,1].
