It is easy to show that a pseudovariety which is reducible with respect to an implicit signature \sigma for the equation x=y can also be defined by \sigma-identities. We present several negative examples for the converse using signatures in which the pseudovarieties are usually defined. An ordered example issue from the extended Straubing-Th\'erien hierarchy of regular languages is also shown to provide a positive example for the inequality x\le y.
