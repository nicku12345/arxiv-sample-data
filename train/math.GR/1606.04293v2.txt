We define the notion of computability of F{\o}lner sets for finitely generated amenable groups. We prove, by an explicit description, that the Kharlampovich group, a finitely presented solvable group with unsolvable word problem, has computable F{\o}lner sets. We also prove computability of F{\o}lner sets for a group that is extension of an amenable group with solvable word problem by a finitely generated group with computable F{\o}lner sets with subrecursive distortion function. Moreover we obtain some known and some new upper bounds for the F{\o}lner function in these particular extensions.
