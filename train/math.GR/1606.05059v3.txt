We prove, when S is a 2-group of order at most 2^9, that each reduced fusion system over S is the fusion system of a finite simple group and is tame. It then follows that each saturated fusion system over a 2-group of order at most 2^9 is realizable. What is most interesting about this result is the method of proof: we show that among 2-groups with order in this range, the ones which can be Sylow 2-subgroups of finite simple groups are almost completely determined by criteria based on Bender's classification of groups with strongly 2-embedded subgroups.
