In the case where G=SL_{2}(F) for a non-archimedean local field F and \Gamma is a discrete torsion-free cocompact subgroup of G, there is a known relationship between the Ihara zeta function for the quotient of the Bruhat-Tits tree of G by the action of \Gamma, and an alternating product of determinants of twisted Poincar\'e series for parabolic subgroups of the affine Weyl group of G. We show how this can be generalised to other split simple algebraic groups of rank two over F, and formulate a conjecture about how this might be generalised to groups of higher rank.
