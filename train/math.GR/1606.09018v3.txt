We investigate gcd-monoids, which are cancellative monoids in which any two elements admit a left and a right gcd, and the associated reduction of multifractions (arXiv:1606.08991 and 1606.08995), a general approach to the word problem for the enveloping group. Here we consider the particular case of interval monoids associated with finite posets. In this way, we construct gcd-monoids, in which reduction of multifractions has prescribed properties not yet known to be compatible: semi-convergence of reduction without convergence, semi-convergence up to some level but not beyond, non-embeddability into the enveloping group (a strong negation of semi-convergence).
