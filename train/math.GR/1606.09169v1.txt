A loop (Q,\cdot,\backslash,/) is called a middle Bol loop if it obeys the identity x(yz\backslash x)=(x/z)(y\backslash x). In this paper, some new algebraic properties of a middle Bol loop are established. Four bi-variate mappings f_i,g_i,~i=1,2 and four j-variate mappings \alpha_j,\beta_j,\phi_j,\psi_j,~j\in\mathbb{N} are introduced and some interesting properties of the former are found. Neccessary and sufficient conditons in terms of f_i,g_i,~i=1,2, for a middle Bol loop to have the elasticity property, RIP, LIP, right alternative property (RAP) and left alternative property (LAP) are establsihed. Also, neccessary and sufficient conditons in terms of \alpha_j,\beta_j,\phi_j,\psi_j,~j\in\mathbb{N}, for a middle Bol loop to have power RAP and power LAP are establsihed. Neccessary and sufficient conditons in terms of f_i,g_i,~i=1,2 and \alpha_j,\beta_j,\phi_j,\psi_j,~j\in\mathbb{N}, for a middle Bol loop to be a group, Moufang loop or extra loop are established. A middle Bol loop is shown to belong to some classes of loops whose identiites are of the J.D. Phillips' RIF-loop and WRIF-loop (generalizations of Moufang and Steiner loops) and WIP power associative conjugacy closed loop types if and only if some identities defined by g_1 and g_2 are obeyed.
