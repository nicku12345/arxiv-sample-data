We suggest a criterion under which for a nilpotent group of finite exponent A and for an abelian group B the variety var(A \,Wr\, B) generated by their wreath product A \,Wr\, B is equal to the product of varieties var(A) and var(B) generated by A and B. Namely the equality holds if and only if either the group B is not of some non-zero exponent; or if B is of a non-zero exponent n, and B contains a subgroup isomorphic to C_{d}^c \times C_{n/d}^\infty, where c is the nilpotency class of A, d is the largest divisor of n coprime with m, C_{d}^c is the direct power of c copies of the cycle C_d of order d, C_{n/d}^\infty is the direct power of countably many copies of the cycle C_{n/d} of order n/d. This criterion continues our previous work on cases when the similar criterions were given for wreath products of abelian groups or of finite groups. Also, this is a generalization of known results in literature, which solve the same problem for much more restricted cases. Some applications of the criterion are considered at the end of paper.
