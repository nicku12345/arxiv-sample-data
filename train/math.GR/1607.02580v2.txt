We give a proof that groups satisfying the "uniform C'(1/6)" small cancellation condition admit a geometric action on a CAT(-1) space. It follows that random groups at density <1/12 are CAT(-1). The proof consists of a direct construction of a piecewise hyperbolic structure on the presentation complex of such a group, together with folding moves to make the complex negatively curved. The argument was originally suggested by Gromov.
