Given a group G, we consider its classifying space for the family of virtually cyclic subgroups. We show for many groups, including for example, one-relator groups, acylindrically hyperbolic groups, 3-manifold groups and CAT(0) cube groups, that they do not admit a finite model for this classifying space unless they are virtually cyclic. This settles a conjecture due to Juan-Pineda and Leary for these classes of groups.
