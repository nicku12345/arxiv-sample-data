A transitive permutation group is semiprimitive if each of its normal subgroups is transitive or semiregular. Interest in this class of groups is motivated by two sources: problems arising in universal algebra related to collapsing monoids and the graph-restrictive problem for permutation groups. Here we develop a theory of semiprimitive groups which encompasses their structure, their quotient actions and a method by which all finite semiprimitive groups are constructed. We also extend some results from the theory of primitive groups to semiprimitive groups, and conclude with open problems of a similar nature.
