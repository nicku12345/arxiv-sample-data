A set B is a basis for a vector space V if every element of V can be uniquely written as a linear combination of the elements of B. There is a similar definition of a basis for a finite group. We show that certain semidirect products of finite groups---including all semidirect products of finite abelian groups---have bases; any group of order m or 2m for odd, cube-free m has a basis; and the quaternions do not have a basis.
