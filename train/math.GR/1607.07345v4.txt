In this paper we define a new algebraic object: the disguised-groups. We show the main properties of the disguised-groups and, as a consequence, we will see that disguised-groups coincide with regular semigroups. We prove many of the results of the theory of groups adapted to this case and some unknown results in the theory of groups and regular semigroups.
