Assume that there is a free group action of automorphisms on a bipartite graph. If there is a perfect matching on the factor graph, then obviously there is a perfect matching on the graph. Surprisingly, the reversed is also true for amenable groups: if there is a perfect matching on the graph, there is also a perfect matching on the factor graph, i. e. a group invariant ("symmetric") perfect matching on the graph.
