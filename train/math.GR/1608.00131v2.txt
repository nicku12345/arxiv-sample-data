In this paper, we study the fibers of "automorphic word maps", a certain generalization of word maps, on finite groups and on nonabelian finite simple groups in particular. As an application, we derive a structural restriction on finite groups G where, for some fixed nonempty reduced word w in d variables and some fixed \rho\in\left(0,1\right], the word map w_G on G has a fiber of size at least \rho|G|^d: No sufficiently large alternating group and no (classical) simple group of Lie type of sufficiently high rank can occur as a composition factor of such a group G.
