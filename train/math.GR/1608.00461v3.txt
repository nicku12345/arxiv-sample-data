Let T be a locally finite tree without vertices of degree 1. We show that among the closed subgroups of \mathrm{Aut}(T) acting with a bounded number of orbits, the Chabauty-closure of the set of topologically simple groups is the set of groups without proper open subgroup of finite index. Moreover, if all vertices of T have degree \geq 3, then the set of isomorphism classes of topologically simple closed subgroups of \mathrm{Aut}(T) acting doubly transitively on \partial T carries a natural compact Hausdorff topology inherited from Chabauty. Some of our considerations are valid in the context of automorphism groups of locally finite connected graphs. Applications to Weyl-transitive automorphism groups of buildings are also presented.
