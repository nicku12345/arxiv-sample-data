For a linearly ordered group G let us define a subset A\subseteq G to be a \emph{shift-set} if for any x,y,z\in A with y < x we get x\cdot y^{-1}\cdot z\in A. We describe the natural partial order and solutions of equations on the semigroup \mathscr{B}(A) of shifts of positive cones of A. We study topologizations of the semigroup \mathscr{B}(A). In particular, we show that for an arbitrary countable linearly ordered group G and a non-empty shift-set A of G every Baire shift-continuous T_1-topology \tau on \mathscr{B}(A) is discrete. Also we prove that for an arbitrary linearly non-densely ordered group G and a non-empty shift-set A of G, every shift-continuous Hausdorff topology \tau on the semigroup \mathscr{B}(A) is discrete, and hence \left(\mathscr{B}(A),\tau\right) is a discrete subspace of any Hausdorff semitopological semigroup which contains \mathscr{B}(A) as a subsemigroup.
