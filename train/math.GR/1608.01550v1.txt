We consider the action of an irreducible outer automorphism \phi on the closure of Culler--Vogtmann Outer space. This action has north-south dynamics and so, under iteration, points converge exponentially to [T^\phi_+].   For each N \geq 3, we give a family of outer automorphisms \phi_k \in \textrm{Out}(\mathbb{F}_N) such that as, k goes to infinity, the rate of convergence of \phi_k goes to infinity while the rate of convergence of \phi_k^{-1} goes to one. Even if we only require the rate of convergence of \phi_k to remain bounded away from one, no such family can be constructed when N < 3.   This family also provides an explicit example of a property described by Handel and Mosher: that there is no uniform upper bound on the distance between the axes of an automorphism and its inverse.
