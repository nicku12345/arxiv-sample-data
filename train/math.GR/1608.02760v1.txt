A finite non-abelian group G is called super integral if the spectrum, Laplacian spectrum and signless Laplacian spectrum of its commuting graph contain only integers. In this paper, we first compute various spectra of several families of finite non-abelian groups and conclude that those groups are super integral. As an application of our results we obtain some positive integers n such that n-centralizer groups are super integral. We also obtain some positive rational numbers r such that G is super integral if it has commutativity degree r. In the last section, we show that G is super integral if G is not isomorphic to S_4 and its commuting graph is planar. We conclude the paper showing that G is super integral if its commuting graph is toroidal.
