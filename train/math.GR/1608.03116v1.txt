In this paper we show that if Y is a subsemilattice of a finite semilattice indecomposable semigroup S then |Y|\leq 2\left\lfloor \frac{|S|-1}{4}\right\rfloor+1. We also characterize finite semilattice indecomposable semigroups S which contains a subsemilattice Y with |S|=4k+1 and |Y|=2\left\lfloor \frac{|S|-1}{4}\right\rfloor+1=2k+1. They are special inverse semigroups. Our investigation is based on our new result proved in this paper which characterize finite semilattice indecomposable semigroups with a zero by only use the properties of its semigroup algebra.
