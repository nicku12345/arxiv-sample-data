Let \sigma =\{\sigma_{i} | i\in I\} be some partition of the set of all primes \Bbb{P}. A set {\cal H} of subgroups of G is said to be a \emph{complete Hall \sigma -set} of G if every member \ne 1 of {\cal H} is a Hall \sigma_{i}-subgroup of G, for some i\in I, and \cal H contains exact one Hall \sigma_{i}-subgroup of G for every \sigma_{i}\in \sigma (G). A subgroup H of G is said to be: \emph{\sigma-permutable} or \emph{\sigma-quasinormal} in G if G possesses a complete Hall \sigma-set set {\cal H} such that HA^{x}=A^{x}H for all A\in {\cal H} and x\in G: \emph{{\sigma}-subnormal} in G if there is a subgroup chain A=A_{0} \leq A_{1} \leq \cdots \leq A_{t}=G such that either A_{i-1}\trianglelefteq A_{i} or A_{i}/(A_{i-1})_{A_{i}} is a finite \sigma_{i}-group for some \sigma_{i}\in \sigma for all i=1, \ldots t.   If each n-maximal subgroup of G is \sigma-subnormal (\sigma-quasinormal, respectively) in G but, in the case  n > 1, some (n-1)-maximal subgroup is not \sigma-subnormal (not \sigma-quasinormal, respectively)) in G, we write m_{\sigma}(G)=n (m_{\sigma q}(G)=n, respectively).   In this paper, we show that the parameters m_{\sigma}(G) and m_{\sigma q}(G) make possible to bound the \sigma-nilpotent length  \ l_{\sigma}(G) (see below the definitions of the terms employed), the rank r(G) and the number |\pi (G)| of all distinct primes dividing the order |G| of a finite soluble group G.   We also give conditions under which a finite group is \sigma-soluble or \sigma-nilpotent, and describe the structure of a finite soluble group G in the case when m_{\sigma}(G)=|\pi (G)|. Some known results are generalized.
