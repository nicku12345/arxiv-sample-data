In this paper we study conjugacy separability of subdirect products of two free (or hyperbolic) groups. We establish necessary and sufficient criteria and apply them to fibre products to produce a finitely presented group G_1 in which all finite index subgroups are conjugacy separable, but which has an index 2 overgroup that is not conjugacy separable. Conversely, we construct a finitely presented group G_2 which has a non-conjugacy separable subgroup of index 2 such that every finite index normal overgroup of G_2 is conjugacy separable. The normality of the overgroup is essential in the last example, as such a group G_2 will always posses an index 3 overgroup that is not conjugacy separable.   Finally, we characterize p-conjugacy separable subdirect products of two free groups, where p is a prime. We show that fibre products provide a natural correspondence between residually finite p-groups and p-conjugacy separable subdirect products of two non-abelian free groups. As a consequence, we deduce that the open question about the existence of an infinite finitely presented residually finite p-group is equivalent to the question about the existence of a finitely generated p-conjugacy separable full subdirect product of infinite index in the direct product of two free groups.
