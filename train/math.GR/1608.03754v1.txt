Generalizing classical extension theory, we solve a Schreier-type extension problem for polygroups by groups. As a consequence, we obtain a method for computing a presentation for a group from its action on a set. The usefulness of this method is illustrated by deriving explicit presentations for the groups GL_2 over valuation rings and over valued fields, for the groups SL_3 over arbitrary fields, as well as for the five Mathieu groups. Moreover, we sketch some aspects of a new deformation technique for groups, their actions, and presentations, and apply it to compute presentations for the sharply 3-transitive Zassenhaus groups M(q^2) (in the notation of Huppert and Blackburn) for any odd prime power q. This computation serves to demonstrate how suitable deformation of groups and their actions interacts with, and thereby enhances, the presentation method.
