We give examples of countable linear groups in SL_{n}(R) for n \ge 3, with no nontrivial normal abelian subgroups, that admit a faithful sharply 2-transitive action on a set. Without the linearity assumption, such groups were recently constructed by Rips, Segev, and Tent. Our examples are of permutational characteristic 2, in the sense that involutions do not fix a point in the 2-transitive action.
