The congruence subgroup problem for a finitely generated group \Gamma asks whether \widehat{Aut\left(\Gamma\right)}\to Aut(\hat{\Gamma}) is injective, or more generally, what is its kernel C\left(\Gamma\right)? Here \hat{X} denotes the profinite completion of X. In this paper we first give two new short proofs of two known results (for \Gamma=F_{2} and \Phi_{2}) and a new result for \Gamma=\Phi_{3}:   1. C\left(F_{2}\right)=\left\{ e\right\} when F_{2} is the free group on two generators.   2. C\left(\Phi_{2}\right)=\hat{F}_{\omega} when \Phi_{n} is the free metabelian group on n generators, and \hat{F}_{\omega} is the free profinite group on \aleph_{0} generators.   3. C\left(\Phi_{3}\right) contains \hat{F}_{\omega}.   Results 2. and 3. should be contrasted with an upcoming result of the first author showing that C\left(\Phi_{n}\right) is abelian for n\geq4.
