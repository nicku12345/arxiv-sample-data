This paper gives methods to describe the adjoint orbits of \mathbf{G}(\mathfrak{o}_r) on \mathrm{Lie}(\mathbf{G})(\mathfrak{o}_r) where \mathfrak{o}_r=\mathfrak{o}/\mathfrak{p}^r (r\in\mathbb{N}) is a finite quotient of the localization \mathfrak{o} of the ring of integers of a number field at a prime ideal \mathfrak{p} and \mathbf{G} is a closed \mathbb{Z}-subgroup scheme of \mathrm{GL}_{n} for an n\in\mathbb{N} and such that the Lie ring \mathrm{Lie}(\mathbf{G})(\mathfrak{o}) is quadratic.. The main result is a classification of the adjoint orbits in \mathrm{Lie}(\mathbf{G})(\mathfrak{o}_{r+1}) whose reduction \bmod\,\mathfrak{p}^{r} contains a\in\mathrm{Lie}(\mathbf{G})(\mathfrak{o}_r) in terms of the reduction \bmod\mathfrak{p} of the stabilizer of a for the \mathbf{G}(\mathfrak{o}_r)-adjoint action. As an application, this result is then used to compute the representation zeta function of the principal congruence subgroups of \mathrm{SL}_{3}(\mathfrak{o}).
