Let G be a simple linear algebraic group over an algebraically closed field K of characteristic p \geq 0 and let V be an irreducible rational G-module with highest weight \lambda. When V is self-dual, a basic question to ask is whether V has a non-degenerate G-invariant alternating bilinear form or a non-degenerate G-invariant quadratic form.   If p \neq 2, the answer is well known and easily described in terms of \lambda. In the case where p = 2, we know that if V is self-dual, it always has a non-degenerate G-invariant alternating bilinear form. However, determining when V has a non-degenerate G-invariant quadratic form is a classical problem that still remains open. We solve the problem in the case where G is of classical type and \lambda is a fundamental highest weight \omega_i, and in the case where G is of type A_l and \lambda = \omega_r + \omega_s for 1 \leq r < s \leq l. We also give a solution in some specific cases when G is of exceptional type.   As an application of our results, we refine Seitz's 1987 description of maximal subgroups of simple algebraic groups of classical type. One consequence of this is the following result. If X < Y < \operatorname{SL}(V) are simple algebraic groups and V \downarrow X is irreducible, then one of the following holds: (1) V \downarrow Y is not self-dual; (2) both or neither of the modules V \downarrow Y and V \downarrow X have a non-degenerate invariant quadratic form; (3) p = 2, X = \operatorname{SO}(V), and Y = \operatorname{Sp}(V).
