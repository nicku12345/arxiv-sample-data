We investigate monotone idempotent n-ary semigroups. One of the main result of this article is the generalisation of Czogala-Drewniak Theorem, which describes the idempotent monotone associative functions having neutral element. Furthermore we present the full characterisation of idempotent, monotone, n-associative functions on an interval which have neutral elements. %{\bl defined}. Our description provides that monotone, idempotent, n-ary semigroups are quasitrivial.
