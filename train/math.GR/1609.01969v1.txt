This is the first in a sequence of papers that will develop the theory of automorphisms of nonsolvable finite groups. The sequence will culminate in a new proof of McBride's Nonsolvable Signalizer Functor Theorem, which is one of the fundamental results required for the proof of the Classification of the Finite Simple Groups.
