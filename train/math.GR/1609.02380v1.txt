This work is a continuation of Automorphisms of K-groups I, P. Flavell, preprint.   The main object of study is a finite K-group G that admits an elementary abelian group A acting coprimely. For certain group theoretic properties \mathcal P, we study the AC_{G}(A)-invariant \mathcal P-subgroups of G.   A number of results of McBride, 'Near solvable signalizer functors on finite groups' J. Algebra {\bf 78}(1) (1982) 181-214 and 'Nonsolvable signalizer functors on finite groups', J. Algebra {\bf 78}(1) (1982) 215-238 are extended.   One purpose of this work is to build a general theory of automorphisms, one of whose applications will be a new proof of the Nonsolvable Signalizer Functor Theorem.   As an illustration, this work concludes with a new proof of a special case of that theorem due to Gorenstein and Lyons.
