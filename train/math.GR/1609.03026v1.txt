In 'Primitive pairs of p-solvable groups', J. Algebra 324 (2010) 841-859, the author proved a non existence theorem for certain types of amalgams of p-solvable groups in the presence of operator groups acting coprimely on the groups in the amalgam. An application of that work was a new proof of the Solvable Signalizer Functor Theorem. In this article, the p-solvable restriction will be weakened to a K-group hypothesis. An application of this work will be a new proof of the Nonsolvable Signalizer Functor Theorem.
