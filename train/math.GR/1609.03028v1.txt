Let A be an elementary abelian r-group with rank at least 3 that acts faithfully on the finite r'-group G. Assume that G is A-simple, so that G = K_{1} \times\cdots\times K_{n} where K_{1},\ldots,K_{n} is a collection of simple subgroups of G that is permuted transitively by A. The purpose of this paper is to characterize G and the collection of fixed point subgroups \{ C_{G}(a) \;|\; a \in A^{\#} \}. An application of this result will be a new proof of McBride's Nonsolvable Signalizer Functor Theorem.
