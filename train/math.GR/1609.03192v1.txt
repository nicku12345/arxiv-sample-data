We consider a 2-dimensional representation of the Hecke algebra \mathcal{H}(G_7, u), where G_7 is the complex reflection group and u is the set of indeterminates u=(x_1, x_2, y_1, y_2, y_3, z_1, z_2, z_3). After specializing the indetrminates to non zero complex numbers, we then determine a necessary and sufficient condition that guarantees the irreducibility of the complex specialization of the representation of the Hecke algebra H(G_7, u).
