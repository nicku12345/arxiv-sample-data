Let G be a p-group of maximal class and order p^n. We determine whether or not the Bogomolov multiplier B_0(G) is trivial in terms of the lower central series of G and P_1 = C_G(\gamma_2(G) / \gamma_4(G)). If in addition G has positive degree of commutativity and P_1 is metabelian, we show how understanding B_0(G) reduces to the simpler commutator structure of P_1. This result covers all p-groups of maximal class of large enough order and, furthermore, it allows us to give the first natural family of p-groups containing an abundance of groups with nontrivial Bogomolov multipliers. We also provide more general results on Bogomolov multipliers of p-groups of arbitrary coclass r.
