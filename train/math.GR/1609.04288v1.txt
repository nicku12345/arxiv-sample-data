We construct 2-generator non-Hopfian groups G_m, m=3, 4, 5, \dots, where each G_m has a specific presentation G_m=\langle a, b \, | \, u_{r_{m,0}}=u_{r_{m,1}}=u_{r_{m,2}}= \cdots =1 \rangle which satisfies small cancellation conditions C(4) and T(4). Here, u_{r_{m,i}} is the single relator of the upper presentation of the 2-bridge link group of slope r_{m,i}, where r_{m,0}=[m+1,m,m] and r_{m,i}=[m+1,m-1,(i-1)\langle m \rangle,m+1,m] in continued fraction expansion for every integer i \ge 1.
