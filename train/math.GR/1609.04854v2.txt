Outer automorphism groups of RAAGs, denoted Out(A_\Gamma), interpolate between Out(F_n) and GL_n(\mathbb{Z}). We consider several vastness properties for which Out(F_n) behaves very differently from GL_n(\mathbb{Z}): virtually mapping onto all finite groups, SQ-universality, virtually having an infinite dimensional space of homogeneous quasimorphisms, and not being boundedly generated.   We give a neccessary and sufficient condition in terms of the defining graph \Gamma for each of these properties to hold. Notably, the condition for all four properties is the same, meaning Out(A_\Gamma) will either satisfy all four, or none. In proving this result, we describe conditions on \Gamma that imply Out(A_\Gamma) is large.   Techniques used in this work are then applied to the case of McCool groups, defined as subgroups of Out(F_n) that preserve a given family of conjugacy classes. In particular we show that any McCool group that is not virtually abelian virtually maps onto all finite groups, is SQ-universal, is not boundedly generated, and has a finite index subgroup whose space of homogeneous quasimorphisms is infinite dimensional.
