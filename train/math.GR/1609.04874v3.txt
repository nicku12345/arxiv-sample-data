Let G be a group. For any \mathbb{Z} G--module M and any integer d>0, we define a function FV_{M}^{d+1}\colon \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N} \cup \{\infty\} generalizing the notion of (d+1)--dimensional filling function of a group. We prove that this function takes only finite values if M is of type FP_{d+1} and d>0, and remark that the asymptotic growth class of this function is an invariant of M. In the particular case that G is a group of type FP_{d+1}, our main result implies that its (d+1)-dimensional homological filling function takes only finite values, addressing a question from [12].
