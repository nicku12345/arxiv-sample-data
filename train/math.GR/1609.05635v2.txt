We study a class of finite groups G which behave similarly to elementary abelian p-groups with p prime, that is, there exists a subgroup N such that all elements of G\setminus N are conjugate or inverse-conjugate under \Aut(G). In this paper, we show that such groups are solvable. As an application, we characterise a class of normal edge-transitive Cayley graphs of G, which are complete multipartite graphs.
