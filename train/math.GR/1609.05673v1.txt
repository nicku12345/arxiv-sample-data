In this paper we give a description of the generators of the prime level congruence subgroups of braid groups. Also, we give a new presentation of the symplectic group over a finite field, and we calculate symmetric quotients of the prime level congruence subgroups of braid groups. Finally, we find a finite generating set for the level-3 congruence subgroup of the braid group on 3 strands.
