We investigate the extent to which the exchange relation holds in finite groups G. We define a new equivalence relation \equiv_{\mathrm{m}}, where two elements are equivalent if each can be substituted for the other in any generating set for G. We then refine this to a new sequence \equiv_{\mathrm{m}}^{(r)} of equivalence relations by saying that x \equiv_{\mathrm{m}}^{(r)}y if each can be substituted for the other in any r-element generating set. The relations \equiv_{\mathrm{m}}^{(r)} become finer as r increases, and we define a new group invariant \psi(G) to be the value of r at which they stabilise to \equiv_{\mathrm{m}}.   Remarkably, we are able to prove that if G is soluble then \psi(G) \in \{d(G), d(G) +1\}, where d(G) is the minimum number of generators of G, and to classify the finite soluble groups G for which \psi(G) = d(G). For insoluble G, we show that d(G) \leq \psi(G) \leq d(G) + 5. However, we know of no examples of groups G for which \psi(G) > d(G) + 1.   As an application, we look at the generating graph of G, whose vertices are the elements of G, the edges being the 2-element generating sets. Our relation \equiv_{\mathrm{m}}^{(2)} enables us to calculate \mathrm{Aut}(\Gamma(G)) for all soluble groups G of nonzero spread, and give detailed structural information about \mathrm{Aut}(\Gamma(G)) in the insoluble case.
