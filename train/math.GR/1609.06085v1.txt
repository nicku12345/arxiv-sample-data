The group of automorphisms of the Brandt \lambda^0-extension B^0_\lambda(S) of an arbitrary monoid S with zero is described. In particular we show that the group of automorphisms \mathbf{Aut}(B_{\lambda}^0(S)) of B_{\lambda}^0(S) is isomorphic to a homomorphic image of the group defines on the Cartesian product \mathscr{S}_{\lambda}\times \mathbf{Aut}(S)\times H_1^{\lambda} with the following binary operation: \begin{equation*}   [\varphi,h,u]\cdot[\varphi^{\prime},h^{\prime},u^{\prime}]= [\varphi\varphi^{\prime},hh^{\prime},\varphi u^{\prime}\cdot uh^{\prime}], \end{equation*} where \mathscr{S}_{\lambda} is the group of all bijections of the cardinal \lambda, \mathbf{Aut}(S) is the group of all automorphisms of the semigroup S and H_1^{\lambda} is the direct \lambda-power of the group of units H_1 of the monoid S.
