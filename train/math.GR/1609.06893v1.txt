In this paper, we classify conjugacy classes of centralizers of irreducible subgroups in PSL(n,\mathbb{C}) using alternate modules a.k.a. finite abelian groups with an alternate bilinear form. When n is squarefree, we prove that these conjugacy classes are classified by their isomorphism classes. More generally, we define a finite graph related to this classification whose combinatorial properties are expected to help us describe the stratification of the singular (orbifold) locus in some character varieties.
