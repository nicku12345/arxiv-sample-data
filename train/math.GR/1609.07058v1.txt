We consider generalisations of Thompson's group V, denoted by V_r(\Sigma), which also include the groups of Higman, Stein and Brin. It was shown by the authors in [20] that under some mild conditions these groups and centralisers of their finite subgroups are of type \mathrm{F}_\infty. Under more general conditions we show that the groups V_r(\Sigma) are finitely generated and, under the mild conditions mentioned above, we see that they are finitely presented and give a recipe to find explicit presentations. For the centralisers of finite subgroups we find a suitable infinite presentation and then apply a general procedure to shorten this presentation. In the appendix, we give a proof of this general shortening procedure.
