"Kourovka notebook" contains the question due to L.G. Kov\`acs (Problem 8.23): If the dihedral group D of order 18 is a section of a direct product X\times Y, must at least one of X and Y have a section isomorphic to D? The goal of our short paper is to give the positive answer to this question provided that X and Y are locally finite. In fact, we prove even more: If a non-trivial semidirect product D=A\rtimes B of a cyclic p-group A and a group B of order q, where p and q are distinct primes, lies in a locally finite variety generated by a set \mathfrak{X} of groups, then D is a section of a group from \mathfrak{X}.
