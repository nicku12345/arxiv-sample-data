Let \sigma =\{\sigma_{i} | i\in I\} be some partition of the set of all primes \Bbb{P}, G a finite group and \sigma (G) =\{\sigma_{i} |\sigma_{i}\cap \pi (G)\ne \emptyset \}. A set {\cal H} of subgroups of G is said to be a \emph{complete Hall \sigma -set} of G if every member \ne 1 of {\cal H} is a Hall \sigma_{i}-subgroup of G for some \sigma_{i}\in \sigma  and {\cal H} contains exact one Hall \sigma_{i}-subgroup of G for every \sigma_{i}\in \sigma (G). A subgroup H of G is said to be: \emph{{\sigma}-semipermutable in G with respect to {\cal H}} if HH_{i}^{x}=H_{i}^{x}H for all x\in G and all H_i\in {\cal H} such that (|H|, |H_{i}|)=1; \emph{{\sigma}-semipermutable in G} if H is {\sigma}-semipermutable in G with respect to some complete Hall \sigma -set of G. We study the structure of G being based on the assumption that some subgroups of G are {\sigma}-semipermutable in G.
