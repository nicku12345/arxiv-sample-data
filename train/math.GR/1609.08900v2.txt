For a sequence \{U_n\}_{n = 1}^\infty of finite index subgroups of a direct product G = A \times B of finitely generated groups, we show that \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{\min\{|X| : \langle X \rangle = U_n\}}{[G : U_n]} = 0 once [A : A \cap U_n], [B : B \cap U_n] \to \infty as n \to \infty. Our proof relies on the classification of finite simple groups. For A,B that are finitely presented we show that  \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{\log |\mathrm{Torsion}(U_n^{\mathrm{ab}})|}{[G : U_n]} = 0.
