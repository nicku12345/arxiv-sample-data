In this paper we define the notion of the locally right regular sequence of semigroups. We show that, if S is a semigroup and \alpha is a congruence on S, then the sequence S/\alpha ^{(0)}, S/\alpha ^{(1)}, \dots , S/\alpha ^{(n)}, \dots  of factor semigroups is locally right regular, where \alpha ^{(0)}=\alpha and, for a non-negative integer n, \alpha ^{(n+1)} is the congruence on S defined by: (a,b)\in \alpha ^{(n+1)} if and only if (xa,xb)\in \alpha ^{(n)} for all x\in S. In our investigation special Rees matrix semigroups over semigroups are used. We also present some further results on this type of semigroups.
