We give a complete survey of a construction by Boone and Collins for embedding any finitely presented group into one with 8 generators and 26 relations. We show that this embedding preserves the set of orders of torsion elements, and in particular torsion-freeness. We combine this with the independent results of Belegradek and Chiodo to prove that there is an 8-generator 26-relator universal finitely presented torsion-free group (one into which all finitely presented torsion-free groups embed).
