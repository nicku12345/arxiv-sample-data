A subgroup H of a group G is said to be pronormal in G if H and H^g are conjugate in \langle H, H^g\rangle for every element g \in G. In [Sib. Math. J. 2015. Vol. 56, no. 6] we proved that subgroups of odd indeces are pronormal in many finite simple group. In [Proc. Steklov Inst. Math., to appear] we proved that a group PSp_{6n}(q) with q \equiv \pm 3 \pmod 8 contains a nonpronormal subgroup of odd index.   In this paper we prove that if n \not \in \{2^m, 2^m(2^{2k}+1) \mid m, k \in \mathbb{N} \cup \{0\}\} then a group PSp_{2n}(q) with q \equiv \pm 3 \pmod 8 contains a nonpronormal subgroup of odd index; if n=2^m then any subgroup of odd index is pronormal in a group PSp_{2n}(q), where q \equiv \pm 3 \pmod 8.
