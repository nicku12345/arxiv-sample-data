A result due to M. Gromov states that any two finitely generated groups {\Gamma} and {\Lambda} are quasi-isometric if and only if they admit a topological coupling, i.e., a commuting pair of proper continuous cocompact actions \Gamma\curvearrowright X\curvearrowleft \Lambda on a locally compact Hausdorff space. This result is extended here to all (compactly generated) locally compact second countable groups.
