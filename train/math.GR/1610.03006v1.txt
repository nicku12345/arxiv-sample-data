Let \sigma=\{\pi_i | i\in I and \pi_i\cap\pi_j=\emptyset for all i\neq j\} be a partition of the set of all primes into mutually disjoint subsets. In this paper we considered subgroups that permutes with given sets of \pi_i-maximal subgroups for all \pi_i\in \sigma. In particular we showed that such subgroups forms a sublattice of the lattice of all subgroups of a finite group. As corollaries we obtained some well known results about S-permutable subgroups.
