For various finitely presented groups, including right angled Artin groups and free by cyclic groups, we investigate what is the smallest dimension of a faithful linear representation. This is done both over C and over fields of positive characteristic. In particular we show that Gersten's free by cyclic group has no faithful linear representation of dimension 4 or less over C, but has no faithful linear representation of any dimension over fields of positive characteristic.
