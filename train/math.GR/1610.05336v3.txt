The minimal faithful permutation degree \mu(G) of a finite group G is the least nonnegative integer n such that G embeds in the symmetric group \Sym(n). We prove that if H is a group then \mu(G)=\mu(G\times H) for some group G then H embeds in A\times Q^k for some abelian group of odd order, some generalised quaternion 2-group and some nonnegative integer k. As a consequence, \mu(G^{n+1})=\mu(G^n) for some nonnegative integer n if and only if G is trivial.
