An almost Abelian Lie algebra is a non-Abelian Lie algebra with a codimension 1 Abelian subalgebra. It is known that such an algebra necessarily has a codimension 1 Abelian ideal. Almost Abelian Lie algebras are perhaps the next simplest Lie algebras after Abelian Lie algebras. The present exposition studies the structure and important algebraic properties of almost Abelian Lie algebras of arbitrary dimension over any field of scalars.
