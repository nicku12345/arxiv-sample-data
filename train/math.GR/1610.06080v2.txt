We give an infinite family of non-abelian strongly real Beauville p-groups for every prime p by considering the quotients of triangle groups, and indeed we prove that there are non-abelian strongly real Beauville p-groups of order p^n for every n \geq 3, 5 or 7 according as p \geq 5 or p =3 or p =2. This shows that there are strongly real Beauville p-groups exactly for the same orders for which there exist Beauville p-groups.
