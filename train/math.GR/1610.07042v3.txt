Let G be a non-abelian p-group of order p^n and M(G) denote the Schur multiplier of G. Niroomand proved that |M(G)| \leq p^{\frac{1}{2}(n+k-2)(n-k-1)+1} for non-abelian p-groups G of order p^n with derived subgroup of order p^k. Recently Rai classified p-groups G of nilpotency class 2 for which |M(G)| attains this bound. In this article we show that there is no finite p-group G of nilpotency class c \geq 3 for p\neq3 such that |M(G)| attains this bound. Hence |M(G)| \leq p^{\frac{1}{2}(n+k-2)(n-k-1)} for p-groups G of class c \geq 3 where p \neq 3. We also construct a p-group G for p=3 such that |M(G)| attains the Niroomand's bound.
