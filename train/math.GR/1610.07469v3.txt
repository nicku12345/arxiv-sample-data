We study embeddings of \mathrm{PSL}_2(p^a) into exceptional groups G(p^b) for G=F_4,E_6,{}^2\!E_6,E_7, and p a prime with a,b positive integers. With a few possible exceptions, we prove that any almost simple group with socle \mathrm{PSL}_2(p^a), that is maximal inside an almost simple exceptional group of Lie type F_4, E_6, {}^2\!E_6 and E_7, is the fixed points under the Frobenius map of a corresponding maximal closed subgroup of type A_1 inside the algebraic group.   Together with a recent result of Burness and Testerman for p the Coxeter number plus one, this proves that all maximal subgroups with socle \mathrm{PSL}_2(p^a) inside these finite almost simple groups are known, with three possible exceptions (p^a=7,8,25 for E_7).   In the three remaining cases we provide considerable information about a potential maximal subgroup.
