Given a locally finite leafless tree  T , various algebraic groups over local fields might appear as closed subgroups of  \text{Aut} (T). We show that the set of closed cocompact subgroups of  \text{Aut} (T) that are isomorphic to a quasi-split simple algebraic group is a closed subset of the Chabauty space of  \text{Aut} (T). This is done via a study of the integral Bruhat-Tits model of  \text{SL}_2  and  \text{SU}_3^{L/K} , that we carry on over arbitrary local fields, without any restriction on the (residue) characteristic. In particular, we show that in residue characteristic  2 , the Tits index of simple algebraic subgroups of  \text{Aut} (T) is not always preserved under Chabauty limits.
