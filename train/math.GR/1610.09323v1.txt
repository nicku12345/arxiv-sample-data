We study the relationship between Donkin's Tilting Module Conjecture and Donkin's Good (p,r)-Filtration Conjecture. Our main result was motivated by a result of Kildetoft and Nakano showing that the Tilting Module Conjecture implies one direction of the Good (p,r)-Filtration Conjecture. We observe that the converse nearly holds; in particular a weaker version of the Good (p,r)-Filtration Conjecture implies the Tilting Module Conjecture.
