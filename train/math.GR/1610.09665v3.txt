Let G be a linear algebraic group over an algebraically closed field of characteristic p\geq 0. We show that if H_1 and H_2 are connected subgroups of G such that H_1 and H_2 have a common maximal unipotent subgroup and H_1/R_u(H_1) and H_2/R_u(H_2) are semisimple, then H_1 and H_2 are G-conjugate. Moreover, we show that if H is a semisimple linear algebraic group with maximal unipotent subgroup U then for any algebraic group homomorphism \sigma\colon U\rightarrow G, there are only finitely many G-conjugacy classes of algebraic group homomorphisms \rho\colon H\rightarrow G such that \rho|_U is G-conjugate to \sigma. This answers an analogue for connected algebraic groups of a question of B. K\"ulshammer.   In K\"ulshammer's original question, H is replaced by a finite group and U by a Sylow p-subgroup of H; the answer is then known to be no in general. We obtain some results in the general case when H is non-connected and has positive dimension. Along the way, we prove existence and conjugacy results for maximal unipotent subgroups of non-connected linear algebraic groups. When G is reductive, we formulate K\"ulshammer's question and related conjugacy problems in terms of the nonabelian 1-cohomology of unipotent radicals of parabolic subgroups of G, and we give some applications of this cohomological approach. In particular, we analyse the case when G is a semisimple group of rank 2.
