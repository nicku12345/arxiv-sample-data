We establish a new sufficient condition under which a monoid is non-finitely based and apply this condition to Lee monoids L_\ell^1, obtained by adjoining an identity element to the semigroup generated by two idempotents a and b subjected to the relation 0=abab \cdots (length \ell).   We show that every monoid which generates a variety containing L_5^1 and is contained in the variety generated by L_\ell^1 for some \ell \ge 5 is non-finitely based. We establish this result by analyzing \tau-terms for M where \tau is certain non-trivial congruence on the free semigroup, that is, we analyze words \bf u with the property that {\bf u} \tau {\bf v} whenever M satisfies an identity {\bf u} \approx {\bf v}.   We also show that if \tau is the trivial congruence on the free semigroup and \ell \le 5 then the \tau-terms (isoterms) for L_\ell^1 carry no information about the non-finite basis property of L_\ell^1.
