We provide a new upper bound for the length for the shortest non-trivial element in the lower central series \gamma_n(\mathbb{F}_2) of the free group on two generators. We prove that it has an asymptotic behaviour of the form O(n^{\log_{\varphi}(2)}), where \varphi=1.618... is the golden ratio. This new technique is used to provide new estimates on the length of laws for finite groups and on almost laws for compact groups.
