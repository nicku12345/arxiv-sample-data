Let K be a global function field of characteristic p, and let \Gamma be a finite-index subgroup of an arithmetic group defined with respect to K and such that any torsion element of \Gamma is a p-torsion element. We define semiduality groups, and we show that \Gamma is a \mathbb{Z}[1/p]-semiduality group if \Gamma acts as a lattice on a product of trees. We also give other examples of semiduality groups, including lamplighter groups, Diestel-Leader groups, and countable sums of finite groups.
