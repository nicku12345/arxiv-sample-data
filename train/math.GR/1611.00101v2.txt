We give an example of a Cayley graph \Gamma for the group F_{2}\times F_{2} which is not minimally almost convex (MAC). On the other hand, the standard Cayley graph for F_{2}\times F_{2} does satisfy the falsification by fellow traveler property (FFTP). As a result, we show that any Cayley graph property K which satisfies \text{FFTP}\Rightarrow K\Rightarrow\text{MAC} is dependent on the generating set. This includes the well known properties FFTP and almost convexity, which were already known to depend on the generating set. This also shows the new results that Poenaru's condition P(2) and the basepoint loop shortening property both depend on the generating set. We also show that the Cayley graph \Gamma does not have the loop shortening property, so this property also depends on the generating set.
