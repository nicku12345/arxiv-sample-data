In their first article, the authors initiated a systematic study of hyperbolic \Lambda-metric spaces, where \Lambda is an ordered abelian group, and groups acting on such spaces. The present paper concentrates on the case \Lambda = \mathbf{Z}^n taken with the right lexicographic order and studies the structure of finitely generated groups acting on hyperbolic \mathbf{Z}^n-metric spaces. Under certain constraints, the structure of such groups is described in terms of a {\em hierarchy} similar to the one established for \mathbf{Z}^n-free groups by Kharlampovich, Myasnikov, Remeslennikov and Serbin.
