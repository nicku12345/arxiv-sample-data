A (left) quandle is connected if its left multiplication group acts transitively. In 2014, Eisermann introduced the concept of quandle coverings, corresponding to so-called constant quandle cocycles that form a subset of quandle cocycles. A connected quandle is said to be \emph{simply connected} if it has no nontrivial coverings, or, equivalently, if its second constant cohomology groups are trivial.   In this paper we develop a combinatorial approach to constant cohomology. Upon applying our theory, we prove that connected quandles that are affine over cyclic groups are simply connected (extending a result of Gra\~{n}a for quandles of prime size) and that finite doubly transitive quandles of order different from 4 are simply connected.
