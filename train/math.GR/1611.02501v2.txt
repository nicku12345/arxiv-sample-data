We consider the probability p(S_n) that a pair of random permutations generates either the alternating group A_n or the symmetric group S_n. Dixon (1969) proved that p(S_n) approaches 1 as n\to\infty and conjectured that p(S_n)=1-1/n+o(1/n). This conjecture was verified by Babai (1989), using the Classification of Finite Simple Groups. We give an elementary proof of this result; specifically we show that p(S_n)=1-1/n+\mathcal {O}(n^{-2+\epsilon}). Our proof is based on character theory and character estimates, including recent work by Schlage-Puchta (2012).
