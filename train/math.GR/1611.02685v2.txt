This paper compares two generalizations of Heisenberg groups and studies their connection to one of the major open problems in the field of locally compact abelian groups, namely the description of the self-dual locally compact abelian groups ([12]). The first generalization is presented by the so called generalized Heisenberg groups \mathbb{H}(\omega), defined in analogy with the classical Heisenberg group and the second one is inspired by the construction proposed by Mumford in [16] and named after him as Weyl-Mumford groups (WM groups). These two families can be defined also in the framework of topological groups. We investigate the relationship between locally compact WM groups, locally compact Generalized Heisenberg with center isomorphic to \mathbb{T} and symplectic self-dualities.
