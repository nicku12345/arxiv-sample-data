In this paper some properties of the \mathfrak{F}^*-hypercenter of a finite group are studied where \mathfrak{F}^* is the class of all finite quasi-\mathfrak{F}-groups for a hereditary saturated formation \mathfrak{F} of finite groups. In particular, it is shown that the quasinilpotent hypercenter of a finite group coincides with the intersection of all maximal quasinilpotent subgroups.
