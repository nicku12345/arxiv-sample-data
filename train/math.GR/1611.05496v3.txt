For cyclically presented groups G = G_n(w) with positive length four relators w = x_0x_jx_kx_l in the free group with basis x_0, x_1, \ldots, x_{n-1}, we classify finiteness and, modulo two unresolved cases, we classify asphericity for the underlying presentations. We show that the fixed point subgroup of the shift x_i \mapsto x_{i+1} is always finite and we relate finiteness of G and asphericity to the dynamics of the shift action by the cyclic group of order n on the nonidentity elements of G.
