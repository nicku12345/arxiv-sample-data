Let G be a finite group, and let N(G) be the set of sizes of its conjugacy classes. We show that if a finite group G has trivial center and N(G) equals to N(Alt_n) or N(Sym_n) for n\geq 23, then G has a composition factor isomorphic to an alternating group Alt_k such that k\leq n and the half-interval (k, n] contains no primes. As a corollary, we prove the Thompson's conjecture for simple alternating groups.
