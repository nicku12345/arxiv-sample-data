W.H.~Mills has determined, for a finitely generated abelian group G, the regular subgroups N \cong G of S(G), the group of permutations on the set G, which have the same holomorph of G, that is, such that N_{S(G)}(N) = N_{S(G)}(\rho(G)), where \rho is the (right) regular representation.   We give an alternative approach to Mills' result, which relies on a characterization of the regular subgroups of N_{S(G)}(\rho(G)) in terms of commutative ring structures on G.   We are led to solve, for the case of a finitely generated abelian group G, the following problem: given an abelian group (G, +), what are the commutative ring structures (G, +, \cdot) such that all automorphism of G as a group are also automorphisms of G as a ring?
