Right Bol loops are loops satisfying the identity ((zx)y)x = z((xy)x), and right Bruck loops are right Bol loops satisfying the identity (xy)^{-1} = x^{-1}y^{-1}. Let p and q be odd primes such that p>q. Advancing the research program of Niederreiter and Robinson from 1981, we classify right Bol loops of order pq. When q does not divide p^2-1, the only right Bol loop of order pq is the cyclic group of order pq. When q divides p^2-1, there are precisely (p-q+4)/2 right Bol loops of order pq up to isomorphism, including a unique nonassociative right Bruck loop B_{p,q} of order pq.   Let Q be a nonassociative right Bol loop of order pq. We prove that the right nucleus of Q is trivial, the left nucleus of Q is normal and is equal to the unique subloop of order p in Q, and the right multiplication group of Q has order p^2q or p^3q. When Q=B_{p,q}, the right multiplication group of Q is isomorphic to the semidirect product of \mathbb{Z}_p\times \mathbb{Z}_p with \mathbb{Z}_q. Finally, we offer computational results as to the number of right Bol loops of order pq up to isotopy.
