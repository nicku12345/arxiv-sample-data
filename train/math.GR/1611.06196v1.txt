Let G be a finite almost simple group. It is well known that G can be generated by 3 elements, and in previous work we showed that 6 generators suffice for all maximal subgroups of G. In this paper we consider subgroups at the next level of the subgroup lattice - the so-called second maximal subgroups. We prove that with the possible exception of some families of rank 1 groups of Lie type, the number of generators of every second maximal subgroup of G is bounded by an absolute constant. We also show that such a bound holds without any exceptions if and only if there are only finitely many primes r for which there is a prime power q such that (q^r-1)/(q-1) is prime. The latter statement is a formidable open problem in Number Theory. Applications to random generation and polynomial growth are also given.
