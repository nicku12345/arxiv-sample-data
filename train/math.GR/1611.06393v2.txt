We introduce a new invariant of finitely generated groups, the ambiguity function, and prove that every finitely generated acylindrically hyperbolic group has a linearly bounded ambiguity function. We use this result to prove that the relative exponential growth rate \lim \limits_{n \rightarrow \infty} \sqrt[n]{\vert B^{X}_H(n) \vert} of a subgroup H of an acylindrically hyperbolic group G exists with respect to every finite generating set X of G, if H contains a loxodromic element of G. Further we prove that the relative exponential growth rate of every finitely generated subgroup H of a right-angled Artin group A_{\Gamma} exists with respect to every finite generating set of A_{\Gamma}.
