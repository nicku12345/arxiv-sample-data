Let \sigma =\{\sigma_{i} | i\in I\} be some partition of the set of all primes \Bbb{P} and G a finite group. G is said to be \emph{\sigma-soluble} if every chief factor H/K of G is a \sigma_{i}-group for some i=i(H/K). A set {\cal H} of subgroups of G is said to be a \emph{complete Hall \sigma -set} of G if every member \ne 1 of {\cal H} is a Hall \sigma_{i}-subgroup of G for some \sigma_{i}\in \sigma  and {\cal H} contains exact one Hall \sigma_{i}-subgroup of G for every i \in I such that \sigma_{i}\cap \pi (G)\ne \emptyset. A subgroup A of G is said to be \emph{{\sigma}-permutable} or \emph{{\sigma}-quasinormal} in G if G has a complete Hall \sigma-set \cal H such that AH^{x}=H^{x}A for all x\in G and all H\in \cal H. We obtain a characterization of finite \sigma-soluble groups G in which \sigma-quasinormality is a transitive relation in G.
