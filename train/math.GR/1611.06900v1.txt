For a finite group generated by involutions, the involution width is defined to be the minimal k\in\mathbb{N} such that any group element can be written as a product of at most k involutions. We show that the involution width of every non-abelian finite simple group is at most 4. This result is sharp, as there are families with involution width precisely 4.
