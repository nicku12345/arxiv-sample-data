We first show that a class of pro-p branch groups including the Grigorchuk group and the Gupta-Sidki groups all have subgroup growth type n^{\log n}. We then introduce the notion of orbit growth and use it to construct extensions of the Grigorchuk group and the Gupta-Sidki groups. We compute the subgroup growth type of these extensions and deduce that all functions between n^{(\log n)^2} and e^n occur as the subgroup growth type of a pro-p group, thus, giving almost complete answer to a question raised by Lubotzky and Segal.
