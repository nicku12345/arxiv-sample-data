We examine distortion of finitely generated normal subgroups. We show a connection between subgroup distortion and group divergence. We suggest a method computing the distortion of normal subgroups by decomposing the whole group into smaller subgroups. We apply our work to compute the distortion of normal subgroups of graph of groups and normal subgroups of right-angled Artin groups that induce infinite cyclic quotient groups. We construct normal subgroups of \CAT(0) groups introduced by Macura and introduce a collection of normal subgroups of right-angled Artin groups. These groups provide a rich source to study the connection between subgroup distortion and group divergence on \CAT(0) groups.
