Let G, H be groups. We denote by \eta(G,H) a certain extension of the non-abelian tensor product G \otimes H by G \times H. We prove that if G and H are groups that act compatibly on each other and such that the set of all tensors T_{\otimes}(G,H)=\{g\otimes h \, : \, g \in G, \, h\in H\} is finite, then the non-abelian tensor product G \otimes H is finite. In the opposite direction we examine certain finiteness conditions of G in terms of similar conditions for the tensor square G \otimes G.
