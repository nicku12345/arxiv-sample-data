We are interested in semigroups of the form \langle G,a\rangle\setminus G, where G is a permutation group of degree n and a a non-permutation on the domain of G. A theorem of the first author, Mitchell and Schneider shows that, if this semigroup is idempotent-generated for all possible choices of a, then G is the symmetric or alternating group of degree n, with three exceptions (having n=5 or n=6). Our purpose here is to prove stronger results where we assume that \langle G,a\rangle\setminus G is idempotent-generated for all maps of fixed rank k. For k\ge6 and n\ge2k+1, we reach the same conclusion, that G is symmetric or alternating. These results are proved using a stronger version of the \emph{k-universal transversal property} previously considered by the authors.   In the case k=2, we show that idempotent generation of the semigroup for all choices of a is equivalent to a condition on the permutation group G, stronger than primitivity, which we call the \emph{road closure condition}. We cannot determine all the primitive groups with this property, but we give a conjecture about their classification, and a body of evidence (both theoretical and computational) in support of the conjecture.   The paper ends with some problems.
