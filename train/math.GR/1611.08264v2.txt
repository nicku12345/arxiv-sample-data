A subset S of a group G invariably generates G if G= \langle s^{g(s)} | s \in S\rangle for every choice of g(s) \in G,s \in S. We say that a group G is invariably generated if such S exists, or equivalently if S=G invariably generates G. In this paper, we study invariable generation of Thompson groups. We show that Thompson group F is invariable generated by a finite set, whereas Thompson groups T and V are not invariable generated.
