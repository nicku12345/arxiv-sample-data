In this paper we consider finite 2-groups with odd number of real conjugacy classes. On one hand we show that if k is an odd natural number less than 24, then there are only finitely many finite 2-groups with exactly k real conjugacy classes. On the other hand we construct infinitely many finite 2-groups with exactly 25 real conjugacy classes. Both resuls are proven using pro-p techniques and, in particular, we use the Kneser classification of semi-simple p-adic algebraic groups.
