Let (W,S) be a Coxeter system, let G be a group of symmetries of (W,S) and let f : W \to \GL (V) be the linear representation associated with a root basis (V, \langle .,. \rangle, \Pi).We assume that G \subset \GL (V), and that G leaves invariant \Pi and \langle .,. \rangle. We show that W^G is a Coxeter group, we construct a subset \tilde \Pi \subset V^G so that (V^G, \langle .,. \rangle, \tilde \Pi) is a root basis of W^G, and we show that the induced representation f^G : W^G \to \GL(V^G) is the linear representation associated with (V^G, \langle .,. \rangle, \tilde \Pi).In particular, the latter is faithful. The fact that W^G is a Coxeter group is already known and is due to M\"uhlherr and H\'ee, but also follows directly from the proof of the other results.
