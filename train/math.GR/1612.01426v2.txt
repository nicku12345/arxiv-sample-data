It is known that any locally graded group with finitely many derived subgroups of non-normal subgroups is finite-by-abelian. This result is generalized here, by proving that in a locally graded group G the subgroup \gamma_{k}(G) is finite if the set \{\gamma_{k}(H)\;|\;H\ntriangleleft G\} is finite. Moreover, locally graded groups with finitely many kth terms of lower central series of infinite non-normal subgroups are also completely described.
