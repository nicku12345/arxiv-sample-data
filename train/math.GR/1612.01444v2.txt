For primes p,e>2 there are at least p^{e-3}/e groups of order p^{2e+2} that have equal multisets of isomorphism types of proper subgroups and proper quotient groups, isomorphic character tables, and power maps. This obstructs recent speculation concerning a path towards efficient isomorphism tests for general finite groups. These groups have a special purpose polylogarithmic-time isomorphism test.
