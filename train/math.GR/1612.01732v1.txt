For a finite graph \Gamma, let G(\Gamma) be the right-angled Artin group defined by the complement graph of \Gamma. We show that, for any linear forest \Lambda and any finite graph \Gamma, G(\Lambda) can be embedded into G(\Gamma) if and only if \Lambda can be realised as a full subgraph of \Gamma. We also prove that if we drop the assumption that \Lambda is a linear forest, then the above assertion does not hold, namely, for any finite graph \Lambda, which is not a linear forest, there exists a finite graph \Gamma such that G(\Lambda) can be embedded into G(\Gamma), though \Lambda cannot be embedded into \Gamma as a full subgraph.
