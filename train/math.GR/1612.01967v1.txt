In this paper we study probabilistic aspects such as subgroup commutativity degree and cyclic subgroup commutativity degree of the (generalized) dicyclic groups. We find explicit formulas for these concepts and we provide another example of a class of groups whose (cyclic) subgroup commutativity degree vanishes asymptotically.
