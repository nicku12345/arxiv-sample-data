We present a natural extension of the process of taking a group quotient to arbitrary subgroups. We first review basic concepts from group theory. This will allow us to see the relationship between our new, more general quotient operation and the standard group quotient. In particular, we will find that a naive attempt to perform the quotient process with a nonnormal subgroup actually leads to a well-defined operation which can be easily characterized with existing terminology.
