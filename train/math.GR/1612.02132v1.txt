We give examples to show that it is not in general possible to prove the existence and uniqueness of centric linking systems associated to a given fusion system inductively by adding one conjugacy class at a time to the categories. This helps to explain why it was so difficult to prove that these categories always exist, and also helps to motivate the procedure used by Chermak when he did prove it.
