This paper is a significant part of a general project aimed to classify all irreducible representations of finite quasi-simple groups over an algebraically closed field, in which the image of at least one element is represented by an almost cyclic matrix. (A square matrix M is called almost cyclic if it is similar to a block-diagonal matrix with two blocks, such that one block is scalar and another block is a matrix whose minimum and characteristic polynomials coincide. Reflections and transvections are examples of almost cyclic matrices.   The paper focuses on the Weil representations of finite classical groups, as there is strong evidence that these representations play a key role in the general picture.
