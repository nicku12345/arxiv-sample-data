We classify the Morita equivalence classes of blocks with elementary abelian defect groups of order 16 with respect to a complete discrete valuation ring with algebraically closed residue field of characteristic two. As a consequence, blocks with this defect group are derived equivalent to their Brauer correspondent in the normalizer of a defect group and so satisfy Brou\'e's Conjecture.
