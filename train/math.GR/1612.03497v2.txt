We begin an investigation into the behavior of Bowditch and Gromov boundaries under the operation of Dehn filling. In particular we show many Dehn fillings of a toral relatively hyperbolic group with 2-sphere boundary are hyperbolic with 2-sphere boundary. As an application, we show that the Cannon conjecture implies a relatively hyperbolic version of the Cannon conjecture.
