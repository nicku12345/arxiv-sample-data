Let k be a nonperfect separably closed field. Let G be a (possibly non-connected) reductive group defined over k. We study rationality problems for Serre's notion of complete reducibility of subgroups of G. In our previous work, we constructed examples of subgroups H of G that are G-completely reducible but not G-completely reducible over k (and vice versa). In this paper, we give a theoretical underpinning of those constructions. To illustrate our result, we present a new such example in a non-connected reductive group of type D_4 in characteristic 2. Then using Geometric Invariant Theory, we generalize the theoretical result above obtaining a new result on the structure of G(k)-(and G-) orbits in an arbitrary affine G-variety. We translate our result into the language of spherical buildings to give a topological viewpoint. A problem on centralizers of completely reducible subgroups and a problem concerning the number of conjugacy classes are also considered.
