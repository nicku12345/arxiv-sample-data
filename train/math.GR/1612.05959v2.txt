Suppose that a finite solvable group G acts faithfully, irreducibly and quasi-primitively on a finite vector space V. Then G has a uniquely determined normal subgroup E which is a direct product of extraspecial p-groups for various p and we denote e=\sqrt{|E/\bZ(E)|}. We prove that when e=2,3,4,8,9,16, G will have regular orbits on V when the corresponding vector space is not too small.
