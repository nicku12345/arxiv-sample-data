The main results in this thesis deal with the representation growth of certain classes of groups. In chapter 1 we present the required preliminary theory. In chapter 2 we introduce the Congruence Subgroup Problem for an algebraic group G defined over a global field k. In chapter 3 we consider \Gamma=G(\mathcal{O}_S) an arithmetic subgroup of a semisimple algebraic k-group for some global field k with ring of S-integers \mathcal{O}_S. If the Lie algebra of G is perfect, Lubotzky and Martin showed that if \Gamma has the weak Congruence Subgroup Property then \Gamma has Polynomial Representation Growth, that is, r_n(\Gamma)\leq p(n) for some polynomial p. By using a different approach, we show that the same holds for any semisimple algebraic group G including those with a non-perfect Lie algebra. In chapter 4 we show that if \Gamma has the weak Congruence Subgroup Property then s_n(\Gamma)\leq n^{D\log n} for some constant D, where s_n(\Gamma) denotes the number of subgroups of \Gamma of index at most n. In chapter 5 we consider \Gamma=1+J, where J is a finite nilpotent associative algebra, this is called an algebra group. We provide counterexamples for any prime p for the Fake Degree Conjecture by looking at groups of the form \Gamma=1+I_{\mathbb{F}_q}, where I_{\mathbb{F}_q} is the augmentation ideal of the group algebra \mathbb{F}_q[\pi] for some p-group \pi. Moreover, we show that for such groups r_1(\Gamma)=q^{K(\pi)-1}|B_0(\pi)|, where B_0(\pi) is the Bogomolov multiplier of \pi. Finally in chapter 6, we consider \Gamma=\prod_{i\in I} S_i, where the S_i are nonabelian finite simple group. We show that within this class one can obtain any rate of representation growth, i.e., for any \alpha>0 there exists \Gamma=\prod_{i\in I}S_i such that r_n(\Gamma)\sim n^\alpha.
