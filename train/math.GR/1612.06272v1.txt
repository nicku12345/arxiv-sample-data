In this paper, we complete the classification of which compact 3-manifolds have a virtually compact special fundamental group by addressing the case of mixed 3-manifolds. A compact aspherical 3-manifold is mixed if has at least one JSJ torus and at least one hyperbolic block. We show the fundamental group of a mixed manifold M is virtually compact special iff M is chargeless, i.e. each interior Seifert fibered block has a trivial Euler number relative to the fibers of adjacent blocks.
