A semigroup T is called Taimanov if T contains two distinct elements 0,\infty such that xy=\infty for any distinct points x,y\in T\setminus\{0,\infty\} and xy=0 in all other cases. We prove that any Taimanov semigroup T has the following topological properties: (i) each T_1-topology with continuous shifts on T is discrete; (ii) T is closed in each T_1-topological semigroup containing T as a subsemigroup; (iii) every non-isomorphic homomorphic image Z of T is a zero-semigroup and hence Z is a topological semigroup in any topology on Z.
