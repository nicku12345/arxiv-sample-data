For a semisimple real Lie group G with an irreducible representation \rho on a finite-dimensional real vector space V, we give a sufficient criterion on \rho for existence of a group of affine transformations of V whose linear part is Zariski-dense in \rho(G) and that is free, nonabelian and acts properly discontinuously on V. This new criterion is more general than the one given in the author's previous paper "Proper affine actions in non-swinging representations" (submitted; available at arXiv:1605.03833), insofar as it also deals with "swinging" representations. We conjecture that it is actually a necessary and sufficient criterion, applicable to all representations.
