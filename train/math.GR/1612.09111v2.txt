Recall that a topological space is said to be a k_\omega-space if it is the direct limit of an ascending sequence of compact Hausdorff topological spaces. If each point in a Hausdorff space X has an open neighbourhood which is a k_\omega-space, then X is called locally k_\omega. We show that a topological group is complete whenever the underlying topological space is locally k_\omega. As a consequence, every infinite-dimensional Lie group modelled on a Silva space is complete.
