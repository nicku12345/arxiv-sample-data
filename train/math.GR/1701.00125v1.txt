In this paper we prove the following result.   Let G be a simply connected simple linear algebraic group of exceptional Lie type over an algebraically closed field F of characteristic p\geq 0, and let u\in G be a nonidentity unipotent element. Let \phi be a non-trivial irreducible representation of G.   Then the Jordan normal form of \phi(u) contains at most one non-trivial block if and only if G is of type G_2, u is a regular unipotent element and \dim \phi\leq 7.   Note that the irreducible representations of the simple classical algebraic groups in which a non-trivial unipotent element is represented by a matrix whose Jordan form has a single non-trivial block were determined by I.D.
