Let G be a connected Lie group. In this paper, we study the density of the images of individual power maps P_k:G\to G:g\mapsto g^k. We give criteria for the density of P_k(G) in terms of regular elements, as well as Cartan subgroups. In fact, we prove that if {\rm Reg}(G) is the set of regular elements of G, then P_k(G)\cap {\rm Reg}(G) is closed in {\rm Reg}(G). On the other hand, the weak exponentiality of G turns out to be equivalent to the density of all the power maps P_k. In linear Lie groups, weak exponentiality reduces to the density of P_2(G). We also prove that the density of the image of P_k for G implies the same for any connected full rank subgroup.
