A graph Gamma is said to be 2-arc-transitive if its full automorphism group Aut(\Gamma) has a single orbit on ordered paths of length 2, and for G\leq Aut(\Gamma), \Gamma is G-regular if G is regular on the vertex set of \Gamma. Let G be a finite non-abelian simple group and let \Gamma be a connected tetravalent 2-arc-transitive G-regular graph. In 2004, Fang, Li and Xu proved that either G\unlhd \Aut(\Gamma) or G is one of 22 possible candidates. In this paper, the number of candidates is reduced to 7, and for each candidate G, it is shown that \Aut(\Gamma) has a normal arc-transitive non-abelian simple subgroup T such that G\leq T and the pair (G,T) is explicitly given
