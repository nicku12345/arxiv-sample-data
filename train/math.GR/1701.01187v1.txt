A graph \Gamma is said to be {\em symmetric} if its automorphism group \Aut(\Gamma) is transitive on the arc set of \Gamma. Let G be a finite non-abelian simple group and let \Gamma be a connected pentavalent symmetric graph such that G\leq \Aut(\Gamma). In this paper, we show that if G is transitive on the vertex set of \Gamma, then either G\unlhd \Aut(\Gamma) or \Aut(\Gamma) contains a non-abelian simple normal subgroup T such that G\leq T and (G,T) is one of 58 possible pairs of non-abelian simple groups. In particular, if G is arc-transitive, then (G,T) is one of 17 possible pairs, and if G is regular on the vertex set of \Gamma, then (G,T) is one of 13 possible pairs, which improves the result on pentavalent symmetric Cayley graph given by Fang, Ma and Wang in 2011.
