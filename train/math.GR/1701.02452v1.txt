In order to enumerate the fake projective planes, as announced in~\cite{CS}, we found explicit generators and a presentation for each maximal arithmetic subgroup \bar\Gamma of~PU(2,1) for which the (appropriately normalized) covolume equals~1/N for some integer~N\ge1. Prasad and Yeung \cite{PY1,PY2} had given a list of all such \bar\Gamma (up to equivalence).   The generators were found by a computer search which uses the natural action of PU(2,1) on the unit ball B(\C^2) in~\C^2. Our main results here give criteria which ensure that the computer search has found sufficiently many elements of~\bar\Gamma to generate \bar\Gamma, and describes a family of relations amongst the generating set sufficient to give a presentation of~\bar\Gamma.   We give an example illustrating details of how this was done in the case of a particular~\bar\Gamma (for which N=864). While there are no fake projective planes in this case, we exhibit a torsion-free subgroup~\Pi of index~N in~\bar\Gamma, and give some properties of the surface~\Pi\backslash B(\C^2).
