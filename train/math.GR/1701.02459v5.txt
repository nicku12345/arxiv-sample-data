The congruence subgroup problem for a finitely generated group \Gamma asks whether the map \hat{Aut\left(\Gamma\right)}\to Aut(\hat{\Gamma}) is injective, or more generally, what is its kernel C\left(\Gamma\right)? Here \hat{X} denotes the profinite completion of X. It is well known that for finitely generated free abelian groups C\left(\mathbb{Z}^{n}\right)=\left\{ 1\right\} for every n\geq3, but C\left(\mathbb{Z}^{2}\right)=\hat{F}_{\omega}, where \hat{F}_{\omega} is the free profinite group on countably many generators.   Considering \Phi_{n}, the free metabelian group on n generators, it was also proven that C\left(\Phi_{2}\right)=\hat{F}_{\omega} and C\left(\Phi_{3}\right)\supseteq\hat{F}_{\omega}. In this paper we prove that C\left(\Phi_{n}\right) for n\geq4 is abelian. So, while the dichotomy in the abelian case is between n=2 and n\geq3, in the metabelian case it is between n=2,3 and n\geq4.
