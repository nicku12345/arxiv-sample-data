A group G possesses the Magnus property if for every two elements u,v \in G with the same normal closure, u is conjugate in G to v or v^{-1}. We prove the Magnus property for some amalgamated products including the fundamental group of a closed non-orientable surface of genus 3. This answers a question of O. Bogopolski and K. Sviridov, who obtained the analogous result for genus g > 3.
