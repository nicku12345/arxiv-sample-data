Let G be a finite group. Let \sigma =\{\sigma_{i} | i\in I\} be a partition of the set of all primes \Bbb{P} and n an integer. We write \sigma (n) =\{\sigma_{i} |\sigma_{i}\cap \pi (n)\ne \emptyset \}, \sigma (G) =\sigma (|G|). A set  {\cal H} of subgroups of G is said to be a complete Hall \sigma -set of G if every member of {\cal H}\setminus \{1\} is a Hall \sigma_{i}-subgroup of G for some \sigma_{i} and {\cal H} contains exact one Hall \sigma_{i}-subgroup of G for every \sigma_{i}\in \sigma (G). A subgroup A of G is called: (i) a \sigma-Hall subgroup of G if \sigma (|A|) \cap \sigma (|G:A|)=\emptyset; (ii) {\sigma}-permutable in G if G possesses a complete Hall \sigma-set {\cal H} such that AH^{x}=H^{x}A for all H\in {\cal H} and all x\in G. We say that a subgroup A of G is H_{\sigma}-permutably embedded in G if A is a {\sigma}-Hall subgroup of some {\sigma}-permutable subgroup of G.   We study finite groups G having an H_{\sigma}-permutably embedded subgroup of order |A| for each subgroup A of G. Some known results are generalized.
