Let G be a finite group and M,N be two normal subgroups of G. Let Aut_N^M(G) denote the group of all automorphisms of G which fix N element wise and act trivially on G/M. Let n be a positive integer. In this article we have shown that if G and H are two n-isoclinic groups, then there exists an isomorphism from Aut_{Z_n(G)}^{\gamma_{n+1}(G)}(G) to Aut_{Z_n(H)}^{\gamma_{n+1}(H)}(H), which maps the group of n^{th} class preserving automorphisms of G to the group of n^{th} class preserving automorphisms of H. Also, for a nilpotent group of class at most (n+1), with some suitable conditions on \gamma_{n+1}(G), we prove that Aut_{Z_n(G)}^{\gamma_{n+1}(G)}(G) is isomorphic to the group of inner automorphisms of a quotient group of G.
