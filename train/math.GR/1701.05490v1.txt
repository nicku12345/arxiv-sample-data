Let G be a finite group, and write {\rm cd}(G) for the degree set of the complex irreducible characters of G. The group G is said to satisfy the {\it two-prime hypothesis} if, for any distinct degrees a, b \in {\rm cd}(G), the total number of (not necessarily different) primes of the greatest common divisor {\rm gcd}(a, b) is at most 2. In this paper, we prove an upper bound on the number of irreducible character degrees of a nonsolvable group that has a composition factor isomorphic to {\rm PSL}_2 (q) for q \geq 7.
