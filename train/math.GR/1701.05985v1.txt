Bouc proposed the following conjecture: a finite group G is nilpotent if and only if its largest quotient B-group \beta(G) is nilpotent. And he has prove that this conjecture holds when G is solvable. In this paper, we consider the case when G is not solvable. Let S be a nonabelian simple group except the Chevalley groups A_{n}(q), D_{n}(q), E_{6}(q), and ^2A_{n}(q), if there exists only one factor of G which is isomorphic to S, then \beta(G) is not solvable, of course, is not nilpotent. That means we prove the conjecture in these cases.
