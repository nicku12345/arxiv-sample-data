We investigate the padded version of reduction, an extension of multifraction reduction as defined in arXiv:1606.08991, and connect it both with ordinary reduction and with the so-called Property \mathrm{H}. As an application, we show that all Artin-Tits groups of sufficiently large type satisfy some weakening Conjecture \mathrm{A^{padded}} of Conjecture \mathrm{A}, thus showing that the reduction approach is relevant for these groups.
