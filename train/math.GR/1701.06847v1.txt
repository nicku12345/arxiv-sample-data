In this paper the number of isomorphism classes of the right transversals of the symmetric group \Sigma_{n-1} in the symmetric group \Sigma_n is calculated. This result together with the techniques employed along the paper may be used to go forward in the study and classification of the subgroups with a certain number of isomorphism classes of transversals in the group.
