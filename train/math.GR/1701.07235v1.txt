Let (\Omega, \leq) be a totally ordered set. We prove that if Aut(\Omega,\leq) is transitive and satisfies the same first-order sentences as the automorphism group of the real line (in the language of groups) then \Omega and and the real line are isomorphic ordered sets. This improvement of a theorem of Gurevich and Holland is obtained as a consequence of a study of centralizers associated with certain transitive subgroups of Aut(\Omega,\leq).
