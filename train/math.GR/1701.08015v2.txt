Let \mathbb{N}^{2}_{\leqslant} be the set \mathbb{N}^{2} with the partial order defined as the product of usual order \leq on the set of positive integers \mathbb{N}. We study the semigroup \mathscr{P\!O}\!_{\infty}(\mathbb{N}^2_{\leqslant}) of monotone injective partial selfmaps of \mathbb{N}^{2}_{\leqslant} having cofinite domain and image. We describe the natural partial order on \mathscr{P\!O}\!_{\infty}(\mathbb{N}^2_{\leqslant}) and show that it coincides with the natural partial order which is induced from symmetric inverse monoid \mathscr{I}_{\mathbb{N}\times\mathbb{N}} onto \mathscr{P\!O}\!_{\infty}(\mathbb{N}^2_{\leqslant}). We proved that the semigroup \mathscr{P\!O}\!_{\infty}(\mathbb{N}^2_{\leqslant}) is isomorphic to the semidirect product \mathscr{P\!O}\!_{\infty}^{\,+}(\mathbb{N}^2_{\leqslant})\rtimes \mathbb{Z}_2 of the monoid \mathscr{P\!O}\!_{\infty}^{\,+}(\mathbb{N}^2_{\leqslant}) of orientation-preserving monotone injective partial selfmaps of \mathbb{N}^{2}_{\leqslant} with cofinite domains and images by the cyclic group \mathbb{Z}_2 of the order two. Also we describe the congruence \sigma on \mathscr{P\!O}\!_{\infty}(\mathbb{N}^2_{\leqslant}) which is generated by the natural order \preccurlyeq on the semigroup \mathscr{P\!O}\!_{\infty}(\mathbb{N}^2_{\leqslant}). We prove that the quotient semigroup \mathscr{P\!O}\!_{\infty}^{\,+}(\mathbb{N}^2_{\leqslant})/\sigma is isomorphic to the free commutative monoid \mathfrak{AM}_\omega over an infinite countable set and show that the quotient semigroup \mathscr{P\!O}\!_{\infty}(\mathbb{N}^2_{\leqslant})/\sigma is isomorphic to the semidirect product of the free commutative monoid \mathfrak{AM}_\omega by \mathbb{Z}_2.
