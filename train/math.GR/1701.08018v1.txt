Let G be a finite group and N\unlhd G with |G: N|=p for some prime p. In this note, to compute m_{G,N} directly, we construct a class poset \mathfrak{T}_{C}(G) of G for some cyclic subgroup C. And we find a relation between m_{G,N} and the Euler characteristic of the nerve space |N(\mathfrak{T}_{C}(G))| (see the Theorem 1.3). As an application, we compute m_{S_5, A_5}=0 directly, and get S_5 is a B-group.
