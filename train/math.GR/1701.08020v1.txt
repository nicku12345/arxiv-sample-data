The aim of this chapter is to provide an adequate graph theoretic framework for the description of periodic bifurcations which have recently been discovered in descendant trees of finite p-groups. The graph theoretic concepts of rooted in-trees with weighted vertices and edges perfectly admit an abstract formulation of the group theoretic notions of successive extensions, nuclear rank, multifurcation, and step size. Since all graphs in this chapter are infinite and dense, we use methods of pattern recognition and independent component analysis to reduce the complex structure to periodically repeating finite patterns. The method of group cohomology yields subgraph isomorphisms required for proving the periodicity of branches along mainlines. Finally the mainlines are glued together with the aid of infinite limit groups whose finite quotients form the vertices of mainlines. The skeleton of the infinite graph is a countable union of infinite mainlines, connected by periodic bifurcations. Each mainline is the backbone of a minimal subtree consisting of a periodically repeating finite pattern of branches with bounded depth. A second periodicity is caused by isomorphisms between all minimal subtrees which make up the complete infinite graph. Only the members of the first minimal tree are metabelian and the bifurcations, which were unknown up to now, open the long desired door to non-metabelian extensions whose second derived quotients are isomorphic to the metabelian groups. An application of this key result to algebraic number theory solves the problem of p-class field towers of exact length three.
