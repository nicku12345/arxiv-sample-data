We prove that for every n \in \mathbb{N} and \delta>0 there exists a word w_n \in F_2 of length n^{2/3} \log(n)^{3+\delta} which is a law for every finite group of order at most n. This improves upon the main result of [A. Thom, About the length of laws for finite groups, Isr. J. Math.]. As an application we prove a new lower bound on the residual finiteness growth of non-abelian free groups.
