We adapt the Ping-Pong Lemma, which historically was used to study free products of groups, to the setting of the homeomorphism group of the unit interval. As a consequence, we isolate a large class of generating sets for subgroups of \mathrm{Homeo}_+(I) for which certain finite dynamical data can be used to determine the marked isomorphism type of the groups which they generate. As a corollary, we will obtain a criteria for embedding subgroups of \mathrm{Homeo}_+(I) into Richard Thompson's group F. In particular, every member of our class of generating sets generates a group which embeds into F and in particular is not a free product. An analogous abstract theory is also developed for groups of permutations of an infinite set.
