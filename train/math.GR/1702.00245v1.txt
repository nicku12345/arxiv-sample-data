In 1970 R. Schmidt gave a structural classification for CA-groups. In this paper we consider a condition upon the intersection of element centralisers which turns out to be equivalent to the definition of a CA-group. We then weaken which centralisers we chose to intersect and structurally classify this new family of groups. Furthermore we apply a similar weakening to the class of F-groups introduced by Ito in 1953 and classified by Rebmann in 1971.
