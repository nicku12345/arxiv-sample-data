The notion of an automaton over a changing alphabet X=(X_i)_{i\geq 1} is used to define and study automorphism groups of the tree X^* of finite words over X. The concept of bi-reversibility for Mealy-type automata is extended to automata over a changing alphabet. It is proved that a non-abelian free group can be generated by a two-state bi-reversible automaton over a changing alphabet X=(X_i)_{i\geq 1} if and only if X is unbounded. The characterization of groups generated by a two-state bi-reversible automaton over the sequence of binary alphabets is established.
