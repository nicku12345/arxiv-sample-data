Let G be a finite group and \Aut(G) the automorphism group of G. The autocommuting probability of G, denoted by \Pr(G, \Aut(G)), is the probability that a randomly chosen automorphism of G fixes a randomly chosen element of G. In this paper, we study \Pr(G, \Aut(G)) through a generalization. We obtain a computing formula, several bounds and characterizations of G through \Pr(G, \Aut(G)). We conclude the paper by showing that the generalized autocommuting probability of G remains unchanged under autoisoclinism.
