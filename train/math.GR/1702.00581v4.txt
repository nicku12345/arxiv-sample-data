The affine general linear group acting on a vector space over a prime field is a well-understood mathematical object. Its elementary abelian regular subgroups have recently drawn attention in applied mathematics thanks to their use in cryptography as a way to hide or detect weaknesses inside block ciphers. This paper is focused on building a convenient representation of their elements which suits better the purposes of the cryptanalyst. Several combinatorial counting formulas and a classification of their conjugacy classes are given as well.
