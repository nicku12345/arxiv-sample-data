It is well known that a nontrivial commutator in a free group is never a proper power. We prove a theorem that generalizes this fact and has several worthwhile corollaries. For example, an equation [ x_1, y_1] \ldots [ x_k, y_k] = z^n, where n \ge 2k, in a free product \mathcal{F} of groups without nontrivial elements of order \le n implies that z is conjugate to an element of a free factor of \mathcal{F}. If a nontrivial commutator in a free group factors into a product of elements which are conjugate to each other then all these elements are distinct.
