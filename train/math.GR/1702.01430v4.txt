Let \Gamma be a simplicial, finite, connected graph such that \Gamma does not decompose as a nontrivial join. We prove that two notions of strong quasiconvexity and stability are equivalent in the right-angled Artin group A_\Gamma (except for the case of finite index subgroups). We also characterize non-trivial strongly quasiconvex subgroups of infinite index in A_\Gamma (i.e. non-trivial stable subgroups in A_\Gamma) by quadratic lower relative divergence. These results strengthen the work of Koberda-Mangahas-Taylor on characterizing purely loxodromic subgroups of right-angled Artin groups.
