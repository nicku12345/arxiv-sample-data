Let [n]=\{1,\ldots,n\} be the n-chain. We give presentations for the following transformation semigroups: the semigroup of full order-decreasing mappings of [n], the semigroup of partial one-to-one order-decreasing mappings of [n], the semigroup of full order-preserving and order-decreasing mappings of [n], the semigroup of partial one-to-one order-preserving and order-decreasing mappings of [n], and the semigroup of partial order-preserving and order-decreasing mappings of [n].
