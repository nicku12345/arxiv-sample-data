Chillag has showed that there is a single generalization showing that the sums of ordinary character tables, Brauer character, and projective indecomposable characters are positive integers. We show that Chillag's construction also applies to Isaacs' \pi-partial characters. We show that if an extra condition is assumed, then we can obtain upper and lower bounds on the Chillag's table sums. We will demonstrate that this condition holds for Brauer characters, \pi-partial characters, and projective indecomposable characters, and so we obtain upper and lower bounds for the table sums in those cases. We also obtain results regarding the sums of rows and columns in these tables.
