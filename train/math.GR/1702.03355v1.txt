The main results of this paper is to give a complete characterization of the automaticity of one-relator semigroups with length less than or equal to three. Let S=sgp\langle A|u=v\rangle be a semigroup generated by a set A=\{a_1,a_2,\dots,a_n\},\ n\in \mathbb{N} with defining relation u=v, where u,v\in A^* and A^* is the free monoid generated by A. Such a semigroup is called a one-relator semigroup. Suppose that |v|\leq|u|\leq3, where |u| is the length of the word u. Suppose that a,b\in A,\ a\neq b. Then we have the following: (1) S is prefix-automatic if u=v\not\in \{aba=ba,\ aab=ba,\ abb=bb\}. Moreover, if u=v\in \{aba=ba,\ aab=ba,\ abb=bb\} then S is not automatic. (2) S is biautomatic if one of the following holds: (i) |u|=3,\ |v|=0, (ii) |u|=|v|=3, (iii) |u|=2 and u=v\not\in \{ab=a,\ ab=b\}. Moreover, if u=v\in \{ab=a,\ ab=b\} then S is not biautomatic.
