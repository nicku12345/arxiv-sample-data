Let \sigma =\{\sigma_{i} | i\in I\} be a partition of the set of all primes \Bbb{P} and G a finite group. A set {\cal H} of subgroups of G is said to be a \emph{complete Hall \sigma -set} of G if every member \ne 1 of {\cal H} is a Hall \sigma _{i}-subgroup of G for some i\in I and \cal H contains exactly one Hall \sigma _{i}-subgroup of G for every i such that \sigma _{i}\cap \pi (G)\ne \emptyset. In this paper, we study the structure of G assuming that some subgroups of G permutes with all members of {\cal H}.
