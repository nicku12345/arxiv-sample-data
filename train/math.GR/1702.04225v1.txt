We show that if G is a group of type FP_{n+1}^{\mathbb{Z}_2} that is coarsely separated into three essential, coarse disjoint, coarse complementary components by a coarse PD_n^{\mathbb{Z}_2} space W, then W is at finite Hausdorff distance from a subgroup H of G; moreover, G splits over a subgroup commensurable to a subgroup of H. We use this to deduce that splittings of the form G=A*_HB, where G is of type FP_{n+1}^{\mathbb{Z}_2} and H is a coarse PD_n^{\mathbb{Z}_2} group such that both |\mathrm{Comm}_A(H): H| and |\mathrm{Comm}_B(H): H| are greater than two, are invariant under quasi-isometry.
