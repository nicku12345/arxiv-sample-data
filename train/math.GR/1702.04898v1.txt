We give a complete list of the class two groups with exponent p and order dividing p^8. For each group in the list we compute the number of immediate descendants of order p^9 with exponent p. In each case the number of descendants is PORC, and so the total number of class three groups of order p^9 with exponent p is PORC. Nevertheless, there are groups of order p^8 with exponent p which have a non-PORC number of class three descendants of order p^9 with exponent p.
