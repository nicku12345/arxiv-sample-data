In this article the investigation of Sylows p-subgroups of {{A}_{n}} and {{S}_{n}}, which was started in article of U. Dmitruk, V. Suschansky "Structure of 2-sylow subgroup of symmetric and alternating group" and article of R.~Skuratovskii "Corepresentation of a Sylow p-subgroup of a group S_n" \cite{Dm, Sk, Paw} is continued. Let Syl_2{A_{2^k}} and Syl_2{A_{n}} be Sylow 2-subgroups of corresponding alternating groups A_{2^k} and A_{n}. We find a least generating set and a structure for such subgroups Sy{{l}_{2}}{{A}_{{{2}^{k}}}} and Syl_2{A_{n}} and commutator width of Syl_2{A_{2^k}} \cite{Mur}.   The authors of \cite{Dm, Paw} didn't proof minimality of finding by them system of generators for such Sylow 2-subgroups of A_n and structure of it were founded only descriptively.   The purpose of this paper is to research the structure of a Sylow 2-subgroups and to construct a minimal generating system for such subgroups. In other words, the problem is not simply in the proof of existence of a generating set with elements for the Sylow 2-subgroup of alternating group of degree 2^k  and proof its minimality.   The main result is the proof of minimality of this generating set of the above described subgroups and also the description of their structure.
