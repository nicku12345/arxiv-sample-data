Marek Kuczma asked in 1980 whether for every positive integer n, there exists a subsemigroup M of a group G, such that G is equal to the n-fold product M\,M^{-1} M\,M^{-1} \dots\,M^{(-1)^{n-1}}, but not to any proper initial subproduct of this product. We answer his question affirmatively, and prove a more general result on representing a certain sort of relation algebra by subsets of a group. We also sketch several variants of the latter result.
