Let G be a finite p-group and N be a normal subgroup of G, with |N|=p^n and |G/N|=p^m. A result of Ellis (1998) shows that the order of the Schur multiplier of such a pair (G,N) of finite p-groups is bounded by  p^{\frac{1}{2}n(2m+n-1)} and hence it is equal to  p^{\frac{1}{2}n(2m+n-1)-t}, for some non-negative integer t. Recently the authors characterized the structure of (G,N) when N has a complement in G and t\leq 3. This paper is devoted to classify the structure of (G,N) when N has a normal complement in G and t=4,5.
