Recently, the authors gave some conditions under which a direct product of finitely many groups is \mathcal{V}-capable if and only if each of its factors is \mathcal{V}-capable for some varieties \mathcal{V}. In this paper, we extend this fact to any infinite direct product of groups. Moreover, we conclude some results for \mathcal{V}-capability of direct products of infinitely many groups in varieties of abelian, nilpotent and polynilpotent groups.
