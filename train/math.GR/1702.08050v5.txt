This is the second part of a two part work in which we prove that for every finitely generated subgroup \Gamma < \mathsf{Out}(F_n), either \Gamma is virtually abelian or its second bounded cohomology H^2_b(\Gamma;\mathbb{R}) contains an embedding of \ell^1. Here in Part II we focus on finite lamination subgroups \Gamma --- meaning that the set of all attracting laminations of elements of \Gamma is finite --- and on the construction of hyperbolic actions of those subgroups to which the general theory of Part I is applicable.
