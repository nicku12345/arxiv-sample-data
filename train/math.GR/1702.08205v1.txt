We prove that for every r>0 if a non-positively curved (p,q)-map M contains no flat submaps of radius r, then the area of M does not exceed Crn for some constant C. This strengthens a theorem of Ivanov and Schupp. We show that an infinite (p,q)-map which tessellates the plane is quasi-isometric to the Euclidean plane if and only if the map contains only finitely many non-flat vertices and faces. We also generalize Ivanov and Schupp's result to a much larger class of maps, namely to maps with angle functions.
