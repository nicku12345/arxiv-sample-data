Sometimes it is possible to embed an algebraic trapdoor into a block cipher. Building on previous research, in this paper we investigate an especially dangerous algebraic structure, which is called a hidden sum and which is related to some regular subgroups of the affine group. Mixing group theory arguments and cryptographic tools, we pass from characterizing our hidden sums to designing an efficient algorithm to perform the necessary preprocessing for the exploitation of the trapdoor.
