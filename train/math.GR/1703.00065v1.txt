A super-Brauer character theory of a group G and a prime p is a pair consisting of a partition of the irreducible p-Brauer characters and a partition of the p-regular elements of G that satisfy certain properties. We classify the groups and primes that have exactly one super-Brauer character theory. We discuss the groups with exactly two super-Brauer character theories.
