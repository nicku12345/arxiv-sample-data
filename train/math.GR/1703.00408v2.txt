Call a reduced word w multiplicity-bounding if and only if a finite group on which the word map of w has a fiber of positive proportion \rho can only contain each nonabelian finite simple group S as a composition factor with multiplicity bounded in terms of \rho and S. In this paper, based on recent work of Nikolov, we present methods to show that a given reduced word is multiplicity-bounding and apply them to give some nontrivial examples of multiplicity-bounding words, such as words of the form x^e, where x is a single variable and e an odd integer.
