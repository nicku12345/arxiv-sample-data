Let G be a group acting on a tree T with finite edge stabilizers of bounded order. We provide, in some very interesting cases, upper bounds for the complexity of the intersection H\cap K of two tame subgroups H and K of G in terms of the complexities of H and K. In particular, we obtain bounds for the Kurosh rank Kr(H\cap K) of the intersection in terms of Kurosh ranks Kr(H) and Kr(K), in the case where H and K act freely on the edges of T.
