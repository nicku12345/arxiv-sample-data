We study invariant random subgroups (IRSs) of semidirect products G = A \rtimes \Gamma. In particular, we characterize all IRSs of parabolic subgroups of \mathrm{SL}_d(\mathbb{R}), and show that all ergodic IRSs of \mathbb{R}^d \rtimes \mathrm{SL}_d(\mathbb{R}) are either of the form \mathbb{R}^d \rtimes K for some IRS of \mathrm{SL}_d(\mathbb{R}), or are induced from IRSs of \Lambda \rtimes \mathrm{SL}(\Lambda), where \Lambda < \mathbb{R}^d is a lattice.
