Let \sigma =\{\sigma_{i} | i\in I\} be some partition of the set of all primes \Bbb{P}, G a finite group and \sigma (G) =\{\sigma_{i} |\sigma_{i}\cap \pi (G)\ne \emptyset \}. A set {\cal H} of subgroups of G is said to be a complete Hall \sigma -set of G if every member \ne 1 of {\cal H} is a Hall \sigma_{i}-subgroup of G for some \sigma_{i}\in \sigma  and {\cal H} contains exactly one Hall \sigma_{i}-subgroup of G for every \sigma_{i}\in \sigma (G). A subgroup A of G is said to be {\sigma}-permutable in G if G possesses a complete Hall \sigma -set and A permutes with each Hall \sigma_{i}-subgroup H of G, that is, AH=HA for all i \in I. We characterize finite groups with distributive lattice of the {\sigma}-permutable subgroups.
