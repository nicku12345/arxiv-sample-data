Let H be an open subgroup of a profinite group that can be expressed as intersection of maximal subgroups of G. Given a positive real number \eta, we say that H is an \eta-intersection if there exists a family of maximal subgroups M_1,\ldots,M_t such that H=M_1\cap\ldots\cap M_t and |G:M_1|\cdots|G:M_t|\le |G:H|^{\eta}. We investigate the meaning of this property and its influence on the group structure.
