Cross-connection theory propounded by K. S. S. Nambooripad describes the ideal structure of a regular semigroup using the categories of principal left (right) ideals. A variant \mathscr{T}_X^\theta of the full transformation semigroup (\mathscr{T}_X,\cdot) for an arbitrary \theta \in \mathscr{T}_X is the semigroup \mathscr{T}_X^\theta= (\mathscr{T}_X,\ast) with the binary operation \alpha \ast \beta = \alpha\cdot\theta\cdot\beta where \alpha, \beta \in \mathscr{T}_X. In this article, we describe the ideal structure of the regular part Reg(\mathscr{T}_X^\theta) of the variant of the full transformation semigroup using cross-connections. We characterize the constituent categories of Reg(\mathscr{T}_X^\theta) and describe how they are \emph{cross-connected} by a functor induced by the sandwich transformation \theta. This lead us to a structure theorem for the semigroup and give the representation of Reg(\mathscr{T}_X^\theta) as a cross-connection semigroup. Using this, we give a description of the biordered set and the sandwich sets of the semigroup.
