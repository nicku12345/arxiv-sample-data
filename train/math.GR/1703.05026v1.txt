The fixed point building of a polarity of a Moufang quadrangle of type F_4 is a Moufang set, as is the fixed point building of a semi-linear automorphism of order 2 of a Moufang octagon that stabilizes at least two panels of one type but none of the other. We show that these two classes of Moufang sets are, in fact, the same, that each member of this class can be constructed as the fixed point building of a group of order 4 acting on a building of type F_4 and that the group generated by all the root groups of any one of these Moufang sets is simple.
