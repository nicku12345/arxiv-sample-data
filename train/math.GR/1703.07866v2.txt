The maximal normal subgroup growth type of a finitely generated group is n^{\log n}. Very little is known about groups with this type of growth. In particular, the following is a long standing problem: Let \Gamma be a group and \Delta a subgroup of finite index. Suppose \Delta has normal subgroup growth of type n^{\log n}, does \Gamma has normal subgroup growth of type n^{\log n}? We give a positive answer in some cases, generalizing a result of M\"uller and the second author and a result of Gerdau. For instance, suppose G is a profinite group and H an open subgroup of G. We show that if H is a generalized Golod-Shafarevich group, then G has normal subgroup growth of type of n^{\log n}. We also use our methods to show that one can find a group with characteristic subgroup growth of type n^{\log n}.
