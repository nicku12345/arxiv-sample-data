Wreath products of non-discrete locally compact groups are usually not locally compact groups, nor even topological groups. We introduce a natural extension of the wreath product construction to the setting of locally compact groups.   As an application, we disprove a conjecture of Trofimov, constructing compactly generated locally compact groups of intermediate growth without nontrivial compact normal subgroups.
