We study the normal closure of a big power of one or several Dehn twists in a Mapping Class Group. We prove that it has a presentation whose relators consists only of commutators between twists of disjoint support, thus answering a question of Ivanov. Our method is to use the theory of projection complexes of Bestvina Bromberg and Fujiwara, together with the theory of rotating families, simultaneously on several spaces.
