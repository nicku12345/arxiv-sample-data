We show that the simple elements of the dual Garside structure of an Artin group of type D_n are Mikado braids, giving a positive answer to a conjecture of Digne and the second author. To this end, we use an embedding of the Artin group of type D_n in a suitable quotient of an Artin group of type B_n noticed by Allcock, of which we give a simple algebraic proof here. This allows one to give a characterization of the Mikado braids of type D_n in terms of those of type B_n and also to describe them topologically. Using this topological representation and Athanasiadis and Reiner's model for noncrossing partitions of type D_n which can be used to represent the simple elements, we deduce the above mentioned conjecture.
