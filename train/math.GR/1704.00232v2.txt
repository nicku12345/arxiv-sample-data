A Hopf Galois structure on a finite field extension L/K is given by a finite cocommutative K-Hopf algebra and a Hopf action. In this paper we present an algorithm written in the computational algebra system Magma which gives all Hopf Galois structures on separable field extensions of a given degree and several properties of those. We describe the results obtained for extensions of degree up to 11. Besides, we prove that separable extensions of degree equal to the square of an odd prime have at most one type of Hopf Galois structures.
