It is a classical theorem that the free product of ordered groups is orderable. In this note we show that, using a method of G. Bergman, an ordering of the free product can be constructed in a functorial manner, in the category of ordered groups and order-preserving homomorphisms. With this functor interpreted as a tensor product this category becomes a tensor (or monoidal) category. Moreover, if O(G) denotes the space of orderings of the group G with the natural topology, then for fixed groups F and G our construction can be considered a function O(F) \times O(G) \to O(F * G). We show that this function is continuous and injective. Similar results hold for left-ordered groups.
