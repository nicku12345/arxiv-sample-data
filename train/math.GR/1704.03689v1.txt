We present some homological properties of a relation \beta on ordered groupoids that generalises the minimum group congruence for inverse semigroups. When \beta is a transitive relation on an ordered groupoid G, the quotient G / \beta is again an ordered groupoid, and construct a pair of adjoint functors between the module categories of G and of G / \beta. As a consequence, we show that the homology of G is completely determined by that of G / \beta, generalising a result of Loganathan for inverse semigroups.
