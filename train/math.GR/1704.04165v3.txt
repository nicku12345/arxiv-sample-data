We compute explicit formulae for Dirichlet generating functions enumerating finite-dimensional irreducible complex representations of potent and saturable principal congruence subgroups of \mathrm{SL}_4^m(\mathfrak{o}) (m\in\mathbb{N}) for \mathfrak{o} a compact DVR of characteristic 0 and odd residue field characteristic. In doing so we develop a novel method for computing Poincar\'e series associated with commutator matrices of \mathfrak{o}-Lie lattices with finite abelianization and whose rank-loci enjoy an additional smoothness property. We give explicit formulae for the abscissa of convergence of the representation zeta functions of potent and saturable FAb p-adic analytic groups whose associated Lie lattices satisfy the hypotheses of the aforementioned method. As a by-product of our computations we find that not all 4\times 4 traceless matrices over a finite quotient of \mathfrak{o} admit shadow-preserving lifts, thus disproving that smooth loci of constant centralizer dimension in \mathfrak{sl}_4(\mathbb{C}) ensure presence of shadow-preserving lifts for almost all primes as suggested in a previous paper by Avni, Klopsch, Onn and Voll.
