Let F be any finite-rank free group, and R be any finite subset of \{g, [g]: g \in F-\{1\}\}, where [g]:= \{fgf^{-1}:f\in F\}. By an R-allocating F-factorization we mean a set \mathcal{H} of nontrivial subgroups of F such that \ast_{H \in \mathcal{H}} H = F and R \subseteq \{h, [h] : h \in H, H\in \mathcal{H}\}. We show that Whitehead's (fast) cutvertex algorithm inputs the pair (F,R) and outputs a maximum-size R-allocating F-factorization. Richard Stong showed this in the case where R \subseteq F or R \subseteq \{[g] : g \in F\}, thereby unifying and generalizing a collection of results obtained by Berge, Bestvina, Lyon, Shenitzer, Stallings, Starr, and Whitehead. Our proof is based on the interaction between two normal forms for the elements of F, rather than the algebraic topology of handlebodies, trees, or graph folding.
