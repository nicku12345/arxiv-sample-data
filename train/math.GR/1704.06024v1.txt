We prove that, given a partition of the point-set of PG(3,q), q=2^n >2, by ovoids \{\theta_i\}^q_{i=0} of PG(3,q) and a line \ell of PG(3,q), not tangent to \theta_0 if \ell^\perp denotes the polar of \ell relative to the symplectic form on PG(3,q) whose isotropic lines are the tangent lines to \theta_0, then \ell and \ell^\perp are tangent to distinct ovoids \theta_j, \theta_k, both distinct from \theta_0. This uses the fact that the radical of the linear code generated by the dual duals \ell\cup \ell^\perp of the hyperbolic quadrics , with \ell and \ell^\perp as above, is of codimension 1
