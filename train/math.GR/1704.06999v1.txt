We give a new obstruction to translation-like actions on nilpotent groups. Suppose we are given two finitely generated torsion free nilpotent groups with the same degree of polynomial growth, but non-isomorphic Carnot completions (asymptotic cones). We show that there exists no injective Lipschitz function from one group to the other. It follows that neither group can act translation-like on the other.
