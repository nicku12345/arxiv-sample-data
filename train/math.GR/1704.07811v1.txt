The main aim of this paper is to prove R-triviality for simple, simply connected algebraic groups with Tits index E_{8,2}^{78} or E_{7,1}^{78}, defined over a field k of arbitrary characteristic. Let G be such a group. We prove that there exists a quadratic extension K of k such that G is R-trivial over K, i.e., for any extension F of K, G(F)/R=\{1\}, where G(F)/R denotes the group of R-equivalence classes in G(F), in the sense of Manin (see \cite{M}). As a consequence, it follows that the variety G is retract K-rational and that the Kneser-Tits conjecture holds for these groups over K. Moreover, G(L) is projectively simple as an abstract group for any field extension L of K. In their monograph (\cite{TW}) J. Tits and Richard Weiss conjectured that for an Albert division algebra A over a field k, its structure group Str(A) is generated by scalar homotheties and its U-operators. This is known to be equivalent to the Kneser-Tits conjecture for groups with Tits index E_{8,2}^{78}. We settle this conjecture for Albert division algebras which are first constructions, in affirmative. These results are obtained as corollaries to the main result, which shows that if A is an Albert division algebra which is a first construction and \Gamma its structure group, i.e., the algebraic group of the norm similarities of A, then \Gamma(F)/R=\{1\} for any field extension F of k, i.e., \Gamma is R-trivial.
