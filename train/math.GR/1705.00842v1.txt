Let the group G = AB be the product of the subgroups A and B. We determine some structural properties of G when the p-elements in A\cup B have prime power indices in G, for some prime p. More generally, we also consider the case that all prime power order elements in A\cup B have prime power indices in G. In particular, when G = A = B we obtain as a consequence some known results.
