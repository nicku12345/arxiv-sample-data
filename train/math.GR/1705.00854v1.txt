A locally compact group G has property PL if every isometric G-action either has bounded orbits or is (metrically) proper. For p>1, say that G has property BP_{L^p} if the same alternative holds for the smaller class of affine isometric actions on L^p-spaces. We explore properties PL and BP_{L^p} and prove that they are equivalent for some interesting classes of groups: abelian groups, amenable almost connected Lie groups, amenable linear algebraic groups over a local field of characteristic 0.   The appendix by Corina Ciobotaru provides new examples of groups with property PL, including non-linear ones.
