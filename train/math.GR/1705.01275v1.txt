In this paper, we compute the Laplacian spectrum of non-commuting graphs of some classes of finite non-abelian groups. Our computations reveal that the non-commuting graphs of all the groups considered in this paper are L-integral. We also obtain some conditions on a group G so that its non-commuting graph is L-integral.
