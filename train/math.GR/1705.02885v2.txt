We show that the smallest non-abelian quotient of \mathrm{Aut}(F_n) is \mathrm{PSL}_n(\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}) = \mathrm{L}_n(2), thus confirming a conjecture of Mecchia--Zimmermann. In the course of the proof we give an exponential (in n) lower bound for the cardinality of a set on which \mathrm{SAut}(F_n), the unique index 2 subgroup of \mathrm{Aut}(F_n), can act non-trivially. We also offer new results on the representation theory of \mathrm{SAut(F_n)} in small dimensions over small, positive characteristics, and on rigidity of maps from \mathrm{SAut}(F_n) to finite groups of Lie type and algebraic groups in characteristic 2.
