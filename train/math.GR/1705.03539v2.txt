Let G be a finitely generated group of isometries of \HH^m, hyperbolic m-space, for some positive integer m. %or equivalently elements of PSL(2,\CC).   The discreteness problem is to determine whether or not G is discrete. Even in the case of a two generator non-elementary subgroup of \HH^2 (equivalently PSL(2,\mathbb{R})) the problem requires an algorithm \cite{GM,JGtwo}. If G is discrete, one can ask when adjoining an nth root of a generator results in a discrete group.   In this paper we address the issue for pairs of hyperbolic generators in PSL(2, \RR) with disjoint axes and obtain necessary and sufficient conditions for adjoining roots for the case when the two hyperbolics have a hyperbolic product and are what as known as {\sl stopping generators} for the Gilman-Maskit algorithm \cite{GM}. We give an algorithmic solution in other cases. It applies to all other types of pair of generators that arise in what is known as the {\sl intertwining case}. The results are geometrically motivated and stated as such, but also can be given computationally using the corresponding matrices.
