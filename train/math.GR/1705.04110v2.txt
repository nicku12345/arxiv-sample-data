We present a normal form for outer automorphisms \phi of a non-abelian free group F_N which grow quadratically (measured through the maximal growth of conjugacy classes in F_N under iteration of \phi). In analogy to the known normal form for linearly growing automorphisms as efficient Dehn twist, our normal form for \phi is given in terms of a 2-level Dehn twist on a graph-of-groups \cal{G} with \pi_1 {\cal{G}} \cong F_N, where a conjugacy class of F_N grows at most linearly if and only if it is contained in a vertex group of \cal{G}.   Our proof is based on earlier work of the second author and on a new cancellation result, which also allows us to show that the dynamics of the induced \phi-action on Outer space CV_N consists entirely of parabolic orbits, with limit points all assembled in the simplex \Delta_{\cal{G}} \subset \partial CV_N determined by \cal{G}.
