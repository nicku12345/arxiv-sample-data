A quasiantichain is a lattice consisting of a maximum, a minimum, and the atoms of the lattice. The width of a quasiantichian is the number of atoms. For a positive integer w (\ge 3), a quasiantichain of width w is denoted by \mathcal{M}_{w}. In \cite{BHW2}, it is proved that \mathcal{M}_{w} can be as a Chermak-Delgado lattice of a finite group if and only if w=1+p^a for some positive integer a. Let t be the number of abelian atoms in \mathcal{CD}(G). If t>2, then, according to \cite{BHW2}, there exists a positive integer b such that t=p^b+1. The converse is still an open question. In this paper, we proved that a=b or a=2b.
