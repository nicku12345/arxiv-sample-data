We study groups G where the \varphi-conjugacy class [e]_{\varphi}=\{g^{-1}\varphi(g)~|~g\in G\} of the unit element is a subgroup of G for every automorphism \varphi of G. If G has n generators, then we prove that the k-th member of the lower central series has a finite verbal width bounded in terms of n,k. Moreover, we prove that if such group G satisfies the descending chain condition for normal subgroups, then G is nilpotent. Finally, if G is a finite abelian-by-cyclic group, we construct a good upper bound of the nilpotency class of G.
