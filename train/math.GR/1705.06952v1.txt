Let n be a positive integer and G(n) denote the number of non-isomorphic finite groups of order n. It is well-known that G(n) = 1 if and only if (n,\phi(n)) = 1, where \phi(n) and (a, b) denote the Euler's totient function and the greatest common divisor of a and b, respectively. The aim of this paper is to first present a new proof for the case of G(n) = 2 and then give a solution to the equation of G(n) = 3.
