We study the decomposition of certain reducible characters of classical groups as the sum of irreducible ones. Let {\mathbf G} be an algebraic group of classical type with defining characteristic p>0, \mu a dominant weight and W the Weyl group of {\mathbf G}. Let G=G(q) be a finite classical group, where q is a p-power. For a weight \mu of {\mathbf G} the sum s_\mu of distinct weights w(\mu) with w\in W viewed as a function on the semisimple elements of G is known to be a generalized Brauer character of G called an orbit character of G. We compute, for certain orbit characters and every maximal torus T of G, the multiplicity of the trivial character 1_T of T in s_\mu. The main case is where \mu=(q-1)\omega and \omega is a fundamental weight of {\mathbf G}. Let St denote the Steinberg character of G. Then we determine the unipotent characters occurring as constituents of s_\mu\cdot St defined to be 0 at the p-singular elements of G. Let \beta_\mu denote the Brauer character of a representation of SL_{n}(q) arising from an irreducible representation of {\mathbf G} with highest weight \mu. Then we determine the unipotent constituents of the characters \beta_\mu\cdot St for \mu=(q-1)\omega, and also for some other \mu (called strongly q-restricted). In addition, for strongly restricted weights \mu, we compute the \mult of 1_T in the restriction \beta_\mu|_T for every maximal torus T of G.
