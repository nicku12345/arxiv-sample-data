We prove that if a right-angled Artin group A_\Gamma is abstractly commensurable to a group splitting non-trivially as an amalgam or HNN-extension over \mathbb{Z}^n, then A_\Gamma must itself split non-trivially over \mathbb{Z}^k for some k\le n. Consequently, if two right-angled Artin groups A_\Gamma and A_\Delta are commensurable and \Gamma has no separating k-cliques for any k\le n then neither does \Delta, so "smallest size of separating clique" is a commensurability invariant. We also discuss some implications for issues of quasi-isometry. Using similar methods we also prove that for n\ge 4 the braid group B_n is not abstractly commensurable to any group that splits non-trivially over a "free group-free" subgroup, and the same holds for n\ge 3 for the loop braid group LB_n. Our approach makes heavy use of the Bieri--Neumann--Strebel invariant.
