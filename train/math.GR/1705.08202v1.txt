Given a finite group G, the generating graph \Gamma(G) of G has as vertices the (nontrivial) elements of G and two vertices are adjacent if and only if they are distinct and generate G as group elements. In this paper we investigate properties about the degrees of the vertices of \Gamma(G) when G is an alternating group or a symmetric group. In particular, we determine the vertices of \Gamma(G) having even degree and show that \Gamma(G) is Eulerian if and only if n and n-1 are not equal to a prime number congruent to 3 modulo 4.
