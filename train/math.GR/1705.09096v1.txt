We show that for every finitely generated closed subgroup K of a non-solvable Demushkin group G, there exists an open subgroup U of G containing K, and a continuous homomorphism \tau \colon U \to K satisfying \tau(k) = k for every k \in K. We prove that the intersection of a pair of finitely generated closed subgroups of a Demushkin group is finitely generated (giving an explicit bound on the number of generators). Furthermore, we show that these properties of Demushkin groups are preserved under free pro-p products, and deduce that Howson's theorem holds for the Sylow subgroups of the absolute Galois group of a number field. Finally, we confirm two conjectures of Ribes, thus classifying the finitely generated pro-p M. Hall groups.
