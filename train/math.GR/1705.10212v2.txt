This paper initiates the study of effective twisted conjugacy separability for finitely generated groups, which measures the complexity of separating distinct twisted conjugacy classes via finite quotients. The focus is on nilpotent groups, and our main result shows that there is a polynomial upper bound for twisted conjugacy separability. That allows us to study regular conjugacy separability in the case of virtually nilpotent groups, where we compute a polynomial upper bound as well. As another application, we improve the work of the second author by giving a precise calculation of conjugacy separability for finitely generated nilpotent groups of nilpotency class 2.
