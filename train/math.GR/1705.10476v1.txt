Let \frak {F} be a class of group. A subgroup A of a finite group G is said to be K-\mathfrak{F}-subnormal in G if there is a subgroup chain A=A_{0} \leq A_{1} \leq \cdots \leq A_{n}=G such that either A_{i-1} \trianglelefteq A_{i} or A_{i}/(A_{i-1})_{A_{i}} \in \mathfrak{F} for all i=1, \ldots , n. A formation \frak {F} is said to be K-lattice provided in every finite group G the set of all its K-\mathfrak{F}-subnormal subgroups forms a sublattice of the lattice of all subgroups of G.   In this paper we consider some new applications of the theory of K-lattice formations. In particular, we prove the following   Theorem A. Let \mathfrak{F} be a hereditary K-lattice saturated formation containing all nilpotent groups.   (i) If every \mathfrak{F}-critical subgroup H of G is K-\mathfrak{F}-subnormal in G with H/F(H)\in {\mathfrak{F}}, then G/F(G)\in {\mathfrak{F}}.   (ii) If every Schmidt subgroup of G is K-\mathfrak{F}-subnormal in G, then G/G_{\mathfrak{F}} is abelian.
