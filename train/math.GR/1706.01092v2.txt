We solve the following algorithmic problems using TC0 circuits, or in logspace and quasilinear time, uniformly in the class of nilpotent groups with bounded nilpotency class and rank: subgroup conjugacy, computing the normalizer and isolator of a subgroup, coset intersection, and computing the torsion subgroup. Additionally, if any input words are provided in compressed form as straight-line programs or in Mal'cev coordinates the algorithms run in quartic time.
