We investigate the relationship between the symmetric, exterior and classical cohomologies of groups. The first two theories were introduced respectively by Staic and Zarelua. We show in particular, that there is a map from exterior cohomology to symmetric cohomology which is a split monomorphism in general and an isomorphism in many cases, but not always. We introduce two spectral sequences which help to explain the realtionship between these cohomology groups. As a sample application we obtain that symmetric and classical cohomologies are isomorphic for torsion free groups.
