We construct a Cayley graph \mathbf{Cay}_S(\Gamma) of a hyperbolic group \Gamma such that there are elements g,h\in\Gamma and a point \gamma \in \partial_\infty\Gamma = \partial_\infty\mathbf{Cay}_S(\Gamma) such that the sets \mathcal{RB}(g,\gamma) and \mathcal{RB}(h,\gamma) in \mathbf{Cay}_S(\Gamma) of vertices along geodesic rays from g,h to \gamma have infinite symmetric difference; thus answering a question of Huang, Sabok and Shinko.
