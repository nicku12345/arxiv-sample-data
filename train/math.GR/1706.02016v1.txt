Let \pi be a set of primes. According to H. Wielandt, a subgroup H of a finite group X is called a \pi-submaximal subgroup if there is a monomorphism \phi:X\rightarrow Y into a finite group Y such that X^\phi is subnormal in Y and H^\phi=K\cap X^\phi for a \pi-maximal subgroup K of Y. In his talk at the well-known conference on finite groups in Santa-Cruz (USA) in 1979, Wielandt posed a series of open questions and among them the following problem: to describe the \pi-submaximal subgroup of the minimal nonsolvable groups and to study properties of such subgroups: the pronormality, the intravariancy, the conjugacy in the automorphism group etc. In the article, for every set \pi of primes, we obtain a description of the \pi-submaximal subgroup in minimal nonsolvable groups and investigate their properties, so we give a solution of Wielandt's problem.
