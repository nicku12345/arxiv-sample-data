Let N be a nilpotent normal subgroup of the finite group G. Assume that u is a unit of finite order in the integral group ring \mathbb{Z} G of G which maps to the identity under the linear extension of the natural homomorphism G \rightarrow G/N. We show how a result of Cliff and Weiss can be used to derive linear inequalities on the partial augmentations of u and apply this to the study of the Zassenhaus Conjecture. This conjecture states that any unit of finite order in \mathbb{Z} G is conjugate in the rational group algebra of G to an element in \pm G.
