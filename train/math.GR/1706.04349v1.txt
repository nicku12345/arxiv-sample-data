Let p be a prime, P a finite p-group and \cal F a Frobenius P-category. In "Existence, uniqueness and functoriality of the perfect locality over a Frobenius P-category", Algebra Colloquium, 23(2016) 541-622, we also claimed the uniqueness of the partial perfect locality \cal L^{\frak X} over any up-closed set \frak X of \cal F-selfcentralizing subgroups of P, but recently Bob Oliver exhibit some counter-examples, demanding some revision of our arguments. In this Note we show that, up to replacing the perfect localities by the "extendable" perfect localities over any up-closed set \frak X of \cal F-selfcentralizing subgroups of P, our arguments are correct, still proving the existence and the uniqueness of the perfect \cal F^{\rm sc}-locality, since it is "extendable". We take advantage to simplify some of our arguments.
