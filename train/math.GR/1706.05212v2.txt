Let G be a simple exceptional algebraic group of adjoint type over an algebraically closed field of characteristic p>0 and let X = {\rm PSL}_{2}(p) be a subgroup of G containing a regular unipotent element x of G. By a theorem of Testerman, x is contained in a connected subgroup of G of type A_1. In this paper we prove that with two exceptions, X itself is contained in such a subgroup (the exceptions arise when (G,p) = (E_6,13) or (E_7,19)). This extends earlier work of Seitz and Testerman, who established the containment under some additional conditions on p and the embedding of X in G. We discuss applications of our main result to the study of the subgroup structure of finite groups of Lie type.
