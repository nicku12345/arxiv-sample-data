Linking systems were introduced to study classifying spaces of fusion systems. Every linking system over a saturated fusion system \mathcal{F} corresponds to a group-like structure called a locality. Given such a locality \mathcal{L}, we prove that there is a one-to-one correspondence between the partial normal subgroups of \mathcal{L} and the normal subsystems of the fusion system \mathcal{F}. As a corollary we obtain that, for any two normal subsystems of a saturated fusion system, there exists a normal subsystem which plays the role of a "product".
