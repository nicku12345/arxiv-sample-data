We consider the group \mathfrak{X}(G) obtained from G\ast G by forcing each element g in the first free factor to commute with the copy of g in the second free factor. Deceptively complicated finitely presented groups arise from this construction: \mathfrak{X}(G) is finitely presented if and only if G is finitely presented, but if F is a non-abelian free group of finite rank then \mathfrak{X}(F) has a subgroup of finite index whose third homology is not finitely generated.
