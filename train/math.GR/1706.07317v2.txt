The class, denoted by \mathscr{S}, of totally disconnected locally compact groups which are non-discrete, compactly generated, and topologically simple contains many compelling examples. In recent years, a general theory for these groups, which studies the interaction between the compact open subgroups and the global structure, has emerged. In this article, we study the non-discrete totally disconnected locally compact groups H that admit a continuous embedding with dense image into some G\in \mathscr{S}; that is, we consider the dense locally compact subgroups of groups G\in \mathscr{S}. We identify a class \mathscr{R} of almost simple groups which properly contains \mathscr{S} and is moreover stable under passing to a non-discrete dense locally compact subgroup. We show that \mathscr{R} enjoys many of the same properties previously obtained for \mathscr{S} and establish various original results for \mathscr{R} that are also new for the subclass \mathscr{S}, notably concerning the structure of the local Sylow subgroups and the full automorphism group.
