Let G be a group and q a non-negative integer. We denote by \nu^q(G) a certain extension of the q-tensor square G \otimes^q G by G \times G. In this paper we derive a polycyclic presentation for G \otimes^q G, when G is polycyclic, via its embedding into \nu^q(G). Furthermore, we derive presentations for the q-exterior square G \wedge^q G and for the second homology group H_2(G, \mathbb{Z}_q). Additionally, we establish a criterion for computing the q-exterior centre Z_q^\wedge (G) of a polycyclic group G,  which is helpful for deciding whether G is capable modulo q. These results extend to all q \geq 0 existing methods due to Eick and Nickel for the case q = 0.
