We generalise the notion of a separating intersection of links (SIL) to give necessary and sufficient criteria on the defining graph \Gamma of a right-angled Coxeter group W_\Gamma so that its outer automorphism group is large: that is, it contains a finite index subgroup that admits the free group F_2 as a quotient. When Out(W_\Gamma) is not large, we show it is virtually abelian. We also show that the same dichotomy holds for the outer automorphism groups of graph products of finite abelian groups. As a consequence, these groups have property (T) if and only if they are finite, or equivalently \Gamma contains no SIL.
