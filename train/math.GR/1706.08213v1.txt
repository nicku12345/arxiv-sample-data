An element e of an ordered semigroup (S,\cdot,\leq) is called an ordered idempotent if e\leq e^2. We call an ordered semigroup S idempotent ordered semigroup if every element of S is an ordered idempotent. Every idempotent semigroup is a complete semilattice of rectangular idempotent semigroups and in this way we arrive to many other important classes of idempotent ordered semigroups.
