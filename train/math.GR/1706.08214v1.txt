A regular ordered semigroup S is called right inverse if every principal left ideal of S is generated by an \mathcal{R}-unique ordered idempotent. Here we explore the theory of right inverse ordered semigroups. We show that a regular ordered semigroup is right inverse if and only if any two right inverses of an element a\in S are \mathcal{R}-related. Furthermore, different characterizations of right Clifford, right group-like, group like ordered semigroups are done by right inverse ordered semigroups. Thus a foundation of right inverse semigroups has been developed.
