This article computes the number of fuzzy subgroups of symmetric group S_5. First, an equivalence relation on the set of all fuzzy subgroups of a group G is defined.Without any equivalence relation on fuzzy subgroups of group G, the number of fuzzy subgroups is infinite, even for the trivial group. The\emph{Inclusion-Exclusion principle} is used to determine the number of distinct fuzzy subgroups of \textbf{symmetric group} S_5. Some inequalities satisfied by this number are also established for n \geq 5.
