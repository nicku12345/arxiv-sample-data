The structure of a certain subgroup S of the automorphism group of a partially commutative group (RAAG) G is described in detail: namely the subgroup generated by inversions and elementary transvections. We define admissible subsets of the generators of G, and show that S is the subgroup of automorphisms which fix all subgroups \langle Y\rangle of G, for all admissible subsets Y. A decomposition of S as an iterated tower of semi-direct products in given and the structure of the factors of this decomposition described. The construction allows a presentation of S to be computed, from the commutation graph of G.
