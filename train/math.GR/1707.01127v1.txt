For a finite group G with a normal subgroup H, the enhanced quotient graph of G/H, denoted by \mathcal{G}_{H}(G), is the graph with vertex set V=(G\backslash H)\cup \{e\} and two vertices x and y are edge connected if xH = yH or xH,yH\in \langle zH\rangle for some z\in G. In this article, we characterize the enhanced quotient graph of G/H. The graph \mathcal{G}_{H}(G) is complete if and only if G/H is cyclic, and \mathcal{G}_{H}(G) is Eulerian if and only if |G/H| is odd. We show some relation between the graph \mathcal{G}_{H}(G) and the enhanced power graph \mathcal{G}(G/H) that was introduced by Sudip Bera and A.K. Bhuniya (2016). The graph \mathcal{G}_H(G) is complete if and only if G/H is cyclic if and only if \mathcal{G}(G/H) is complete. The graph \mathcal{G}_H(G) is Eulerian if and only if |G| is odd if and only if \mathcal{G}(G) is Eulerian, i.e., the property of being Eulerian does not depend on the normal subgroup H.
