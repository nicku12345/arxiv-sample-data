We interpret augmented racks as a certain kind of multiplicative graphs and show that this point of view is natural for defining rack homology. We also define the analogue of the group algebra for these objects; in particular, we see how discrete racks give rise to Hopf algebras and Lie algebras in the Loday-Pirashvili category \mathcal{LM}. Finally, we discuss the integration of Lie algebras in \mathcal{LM} in the context of multiplicative graphs and augmented racks.
