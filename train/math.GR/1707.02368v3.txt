Let G be a finite solvable group, given through a refined consistent polycyclic presentation, and \alpha an automorphism of G, given through its images of the generators of G. In this paper, we discuss algorithms for computing the order of \alpha as well as the cycle length of a given element of G under \alpha. We give correctness proofs and discuss the theoretical complexity of these algorithms. Along the way, we carry out detailed complexity analyses of several classical algorithms on finite polycyclic groups.
