We propose an efficient approach for the grouping of local orientations (points on vessels) via nilpotent approximations of sub-Riemannian distances in the 2D and 3D roto-translation groups SE(2) and SE(3). In our distance approximations we consider homogeneous norms on nilpotent groups that locally approximate SE(n), and which are obtained via the exponential and logarithmic map on SE(n). In a qualitative validation we show that the norms provide accurate approximations of the true sub-Riemannian distances, and we discuss their relations to the fundamental solution of the sub-Laplacian on SE(n). The quantitative experiments further confirm the accuracy of the approximations. Quantitative results are obtained by evaluating perceptual grouping performance of retinal blood vessels in 2D images and curves in challenging 3D synthetic volumes. The results show that 1) sub-Riemannian geometry is essential in achieving top performance and 2) that grouping via the fast analytic approximations performs almost equally, or better, than data-adaptive fast marching approaches on \mathbb{R}^n and SE(n).
