The involution fixity {\rm ifix}(G) of a permutation group G of degree n is the maximum number of fixed points of an involution. In this paper we study the involution fixity of primitive almost simple exceptional groups of Lie type. We show that if T is the socle of such a group, then either {\rm ifix}(T) > n^{1/3}, or {\rm ifix}(T) = 1 and T = {}^2B_2(q) is a Suzuki group in its natural 2-transitive action of degree n=q^2+1. This bound is best possible and we present more detailed results for each family of exceptional groups, which allows us to determine the groups with {\rm ifix}(T) \leqslant n^{4/9}. This extends recent work of Liebeck and Shalev, who established the bound {\rm ifix}(T) > n^{1/6} for every almost simple primitive group of degree n with socle T (with a prescribed list of exceptions). Finally, by combining our results with the Lang-Weil estimates from algebraic geometry, we determine bounds on a natural analogue of involution fixity for primitive actions of exceptional algebraic groups over algebraically closed fields.
