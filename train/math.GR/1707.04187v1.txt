For an element g of a group G, an Engel sink is a subset {\mathscr E}(g) such that for every x\in G all sufficiently long commutators [...[[x,g],g],\dots ,g] belong to {\mathscr E}(g). A~finite group is nilpotent if and only if every element has a trivial Engel sink. We prove that if in a finite group G every element has an Engel sink generating a subgroup of rank~r, then G has a normal subgroup N of rank bounded in terms of r such that G/N is nilpotent.
