We consider factorizations G=XY where G is a general group, X and Y are normal subsets of G and any g\in G has a unique representation g=xy with x\in X and y\in Y. This definition coincides with the customary and extensively studied definition of a direct product decomposition by subsets of a finite abelian group. Our main result states that a group G has such a factorization if and only if G is a central product of \left\langle X\right\rangle  and \left\langle Y\right\rangle  and the central subgroup \left\langle X\right\rangle \cap \left\langle Y\right\rangle  satisfies certain abelian factorization conditions. We analyze some special cases and give examples. In particular, simple groups have no non-trivial set-direct factorization.
