We give a general construction for right conjugacy closed loops, using GL(2,q) for q a prime power. Under certain conditions, the loops constructed are simple, giving the first general construction for finite, simple right conjugacy closed loops. We give a complete description of the isomorphism classes for the construction, yielding an exact count of non isomorphic loops for each q.
