The complement of a hyperplane arrangement in \mathbb{C}^n deformation retracts onto an n-dimensional cell complex, but the known procedures only apply to complexifications of real arrangements (Salvetti) or the cell complex produced depends on an initial choice of coordinates (Bj\"orner-Ziegler). In this article we consider the unique complex euclidean reflection group acting cocompactly by isometries on \mathbb{C}^2 whose linear part is the finite complex reflection group known as G_4 in the Shephard-Todd classification and we construct a choice-free deformation retraction from its hyperplane complement onto an elegant 2-dimensional complex K where every 2-cell is a euclidean equilateral triangle and every vertex link is a M\"obius-Kantor graph. Since K is non-positively curved, the corresponding braid group is a CAT(0) group, despite the fact that there are non-regular points in the hyperplane complement, the action of the reflection group on K is not free, and the braid group is not torsion-free.
