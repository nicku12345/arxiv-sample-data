Nilpotent semigroups in the sense of Mal'cev are defined by semigroup identities. Finite nilpotent semigroups constitute a pseudovariety, \mathsf{MN}, which has finite rank. The semigroup identities that define nilpotent semigroups, lead us to define strongly Mal'cev nilpotent semigroups. Finite strongly Mal'cev nilpotent semigroups constitute a non-finite rank pseudovariety, \mathsf{SMN}. The pseudovariety \mathsf{SMN} is strictly contained in the pseudovariety \mathsf{MN} but all finite nilpotent groups are in \mathsf{SMN}. We show that the pseudovariety \mathsf{MN} is the intersection of the pseudovariety \mathsf{BG_{nil}} with a pseudovariety defined by a \kappa-identity. We further compare the pseudovarieties \mathsf{MN} and \mathsf{SMN} with the Mal'cev product of the pseudovarieties \mathsf{J} and \mathsf{G_{nil}}.
