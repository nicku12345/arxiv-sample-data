Let q be a prime, n a positive integer and A an elementary abelian group of order q^r with r\geq2 acting on a finite q'-group G. The following results are proved.   We show that if all elements in \gamma_{r-1}(C_G(a)) are n-Engel in G for any a\in A^\#, then \gamma_{r-1}(G) is k-Engel for some \{n,q,r\}-bounded number k, and if, for some integer d such that 2^d\leq r-1, all elements in the dth derived group of C_G(a) are n-Engel in G for any a\in A^\#, then the dth derived group G^{(d)} is k-Engel for some \{n,q,r\}-bounded number k.   Assuming r\geq 3 we prove that if all elements in \gamma_{r-2}(C_G(a)) are n-Engel in C_G(a) for any a\in A^\#, then \gamma_{r-2}(G) is k-Engel for some \{n,q,r\}-bounded number k, and if, for some integer d such that 2^d\leq r-2, all elements in the dth derived group of C_G(a) are n-Engel in C_G(a) for any a\in A^\#, then the dth derived group G^{(d)} is k-Engel for some \{n,q,r\}-bounded number k.   Analogue (non-quantitative) results for profinite groups are also obtained.
