Does every one-ended CAT(0) group have semistable fundamental group at infinity? As we write, this is an open question. Let G be such a group acting geometrically on the proper CAT(0) space X. In this paper we show that in order to establish a positive answer to the question it is only necessary to check that any two geodesic rays in X are properly homotopic. We then show that if the answer to the question is negative, with (G,X) a counter-example, then the boundary of X, \del X with the cone topology, must have a weak cut point. This is of interest because a theorem of Papasoglu and the second-named author \cite{PS} has established that there cannot be an example of (G,X) where \del X has a cut point. Thus, the search for a negative answer comes down to the difference between cut points and weak cut points. We also show that the Tits ball of radius \frac{\pi}{2} about that weak cut point is a "cut set" in the sense that it separates \del X. Finally, we observe that if a negative example (G, X) exists then G is rank 1.
