Given a finite group G, let e(G) be expected number of elements of G which have to be drawn at random, with replacement, before a set of generators is found. If all the Sylow subgroups of G can be generated by d elements, then e(G)\leq d+\kappa with \kappa \sim 2.75239495. The number \kappa is explicitly described in terms of the Riemann zeta function and is best possible. If G is a permutation group of degree n, then either G=S_3 and e(G)=2.9 or e(G)\leq \lfloor n/2\rfloor+\kappa^* with \kappa^* \sim 1.606695.
