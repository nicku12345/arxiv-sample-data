The power graph \mathcal{P}(G) is a graph with group elements as vertex set and two elements are adjacent if one is a power of the other. The order supergraph \mathcal{S}(G) of the power graph \mathcal{P}(G) is a graph with vertex set G in which two elements x, y \in G are joined if o(x) | o(y) or o(y) | o(x). The purpose of this paper is to study certain properties of this new graph together with the relationship between \mathcal{P}(G) and \mathcal{S}(G).
