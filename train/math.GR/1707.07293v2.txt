Let G be a finite group and let c(G) be the number of cyclic subgroups of G. We study the function \alpha(G) = c(G)/|G|. We explore its basic properties and we point out a connection with the probability of commutation. For many families \mathscr{F} of groups we characterize the groups G \in \mathscr{F} for which \alpha(G) is maximal and we classify the groups G for which \alpha(G) > 3/4. We also study the number of cyclic subgroups of a direct power of a given group deducing an asymptotic result and we characterize the equality \alpha(G) = \alpha(G/N) when G/N is a symmetric group.
