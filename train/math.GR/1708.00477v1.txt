Generalizing a recent result of Mann, we show that there is an explicit function f:\left(0,1\right]\rightarrow\left(0,1\right] such that for every reduced word w, say in d variables, there is an explicit reduced word v in at most 3d variables (nontrivial if the length of w is at least 2) such that for all \rho\in\left(0,1\right], the following holds: If G is any finite group for which the word map w_G:G^d\rightarrow G agrees with some fixed homomorphism G^d\rightarrow G on at least \rho|G|^d many arguments, then the word map v_G:G^{3d}\rightarrow G has a fiber of size at least f(\rho)|G|^{3d}. We also discuss some applications of this result.
