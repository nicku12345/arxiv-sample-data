We show that locally solvable subgroups of PLo(I) are countable. Then for each countable ordered set, we construct a locally solvable subgroup of Thompson's Group F. We develop machinery for understanding embeddings from solvable subgroups into solvable subgroups. Finally, we apply this machinery to show the ordered sets used in our construction are invariant under isomorphisms between the groups constructed. Therefore, we effectively distinguish the groups and provide uncountably many non-isomorphic locally solvable, hence elementary amenable, subgroups of Thompson's Group F.
