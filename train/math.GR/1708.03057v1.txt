Let G be a locally finite group and F(G) the Hirsch--Plotkin radical of G. Denote by S the full inverse image of the generalized Fitting subgroup of G/F(G) in G. Assume that there is a number k such that the length of every chain of nested centralizers in G does not exceed k. The Borovik--Khukhro conjecture states, in particular, that under this assumption the quotient G/S contains an abelian subgroup of index bounded in terms of k. We disprove this statement and prove some its weaker analog.
