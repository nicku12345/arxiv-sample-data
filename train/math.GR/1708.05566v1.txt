Let G be a split (minimal) Kac-Moody group over \mathbb{R} or \mathbb{C} with maximal torus T, and let \theta be a Cartan-Chevalley involution of G, twisted by complex conjugation, and satisfying that \theta(T)=T. Furthermore, let K be the subgroup fixed by \theta, and \tau:G\to G, g\mapsto g\theta(g)^{-1}. Let A:=\tau(T).   In this note, we show resp. revisit that G admits a (refined) Iwasawa decompositions G=UAK. We also show that if G is of non-spherical type, then it never admits a polar decomposition G=\tau(G)K nor a Cartan decompositions G=KAK. This has implications for the geometrical structure of the Kac-Moody symmetric space G/K \cong \tau(G).
