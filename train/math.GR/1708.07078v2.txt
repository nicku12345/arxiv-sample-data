Let G be a finitely generated group. Given two length functions \ell and m of irreducible G actions on real trees A and B, when is the point-wise sum \ell + m again the length function of an irreducible G action on a real tree? In this article we show that additivity is equivalent to the existence of a common refinement of A and B, this equivalence is established using Guirardel's core. Moreover, in this case the sum \ell + m is the length function of the common refinement of A and B given explicitly by the Guirardel core. We also give a combinatorial characterization of compatibility, generalizing a criterion given by Behrstock, Bestvina, and Clay for free group actions on simplicial trees. This compatibility condition characterizes the convex geometry, in the vector space of class functions, of common deformation spaces of irreduicble actions on real trees, such as the closure of Culler-Vogtmann Outer Space or the space of small actions of a hyperbolic group G.
