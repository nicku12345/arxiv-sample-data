We give sufficient conditions for when groups generated by automata in a class \mathcal{C} of transducers, which contains the class of reset automata transducers, have infinite order. As a consequence we also demonstrate that if a group generated by an automata in \mathcal{C} is infinite, then it contains a free semigroup of rank at least 2. This gives a new proof, in the context of groups generated by automaton in \mathcal{C}, of a result of Chou showing that finitely generated elementary amenable groups either have polynomial growth or contain a free semigroup of rank at least 2.
