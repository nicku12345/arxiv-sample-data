We provide an explicit presentation of an infinite hyperbolic Kazhdan group with 4 generators and 16 relators of length at most 73. That group acts properly and cocompactly on a hyperbolic triangle building of type (3,4,4). We also point out a variation of the construction that yields examples of lattices in \tilde A_2-buildings admitting non-Desarguesian residues of arbitrary prime power order.
