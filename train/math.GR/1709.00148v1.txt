Denote by \nu_p(G) the number of Sylow p-subgroups of G. It is not difficult to see that \nu_p(H)\leq\nu_p(G) for H\leq G, however \nu_p(H) does not divide \nu_p(G) in general. In this paper we reduce the question whether \nu_p(H) divides \nu_p(G) for every H\leq G to almost simple groups. This result substantially generalizes the previous result by G. Navarro and also provides an alternative proof for the Navarro theorem.
