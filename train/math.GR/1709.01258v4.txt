This article is dedicated to the characterisation of the relative hyperbolicity of Haglund and Wise's special groups. More precise, we introduce a new combinatorial formalism to study (virtually) special groups, and we prove that, given a cocompact special group G and a finite collection of subgroups \mathcal{H}, then G is hyperbolic relative to \mathcal{H} if and only if (i) each subgroup of \mathcal{H} is convex-cocompact, (ii) \mathcal{H} is an almost malnormal collection, and (iii) every non-virtually cyclic abelian subgroup of G is contained in a conjugate of some group of \mathcal{H}. As an application, we show that a virtually cocompact special group is hyperbolic relative to abelian subgroups if and only if it does not contain \mathbb{F}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}.
