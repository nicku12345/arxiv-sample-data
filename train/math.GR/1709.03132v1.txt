Let G and H be groups that act compatibly on each other. We denote by \eta(G,H) a certain extension of the non-abelian tensor product G \otimes H by G \times H. Suppose that G is residually finite and the subgroup [G,H] = \langle g^{-1}g^h \ \mid g \in G, h\in H\rangle satisfies some non-trivial identity f \equiv~1. We prove that if p is a prime and every tensor has p-power order, then the non-abelian tensor product G \otimes H is locally finite. Further, we show that if n is a positive integer and every tensor is left n-Engel in \eta(G,H), then the non-abelian tensor product G \otimes H is locally nilpotent. The content of this paper extend some results concerning the non-abelian tensor square G \otimes G.
