The main result of this article is that any braided (resp. annular, planar) diagram group D splits as a short exact sequence 1 \to R \to D \to S \to 1 where R is a subgroup of some right-angled Artin group and S a subgroup of Thompson's group V (resp. T, F). As an application, we show that several braided diagram groups embeds into Thompson's group V, including Higman's groups V_{n,r}, groups of quasi-automorphisms QV_{n,r,p}, and generalised Houghton's groups H_{n,p}.
