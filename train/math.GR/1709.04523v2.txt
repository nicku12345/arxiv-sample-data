Let M=I or M=\mathbb{S}^1 and let k\geq 1. We exhibit a new infinite class of Polish groups by showing that each group \mathop{\rm Diff}_+^{k+AC}(M), consisting of those C^k diffeomorphisms whose k-th derivative is absolutely continuous, admits a natural Polish group topology which refines the subspace topology inherited from \mathop{\rm Diff}_+^k(M). By contrast, the group \mathop{\rm Diff}_+^{1+BV}(M), consisting of C^1 diffeomorphisms whose derivative has bounded variation, admits no Polish group topology whatsoever.
