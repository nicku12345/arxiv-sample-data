The E_8 lattice has been thoroughly studied for more than a century and nearly all the maximal subgroups of W(E_8) have been described-all except 2A_9. We will show that 2A_9 has simple descriptions from three different perspectives: looking at E_8/2E_8; looking at the lattice's norm 2 vectors; and looking at its norm 4 vectors. Two of the three descriptions are especially simple: 2A_9 stabilizes a partition of the 2160 norm 4 vectors into nine scale copies of E_8; and 2A_9 stabilizes a partition of the 135 isotropic points of E_8/2E_8 into nine disjoint isotropic 4-spaces of 15 points each (so the well-known known isomorphism A_8 \cong L_4(2) is visible within E_8.)
