In this paper, we calculate the numbers of irreducible ordinary characters and irreducible Brauer characters in a block of a finite group G, whose associated fusion system over a 2-subgroup P of G (which is a defect group of the block) has the hyperfocal subgroup \mathbb Z_{2^n}\times \mathbb Z_{2^n} for some n\geq 2, when the block is controlled by the normalizer N_G(P) and the hyperfocal subgroup is contained in the center of P, or when the block is not controlled by N_G(P) and the hyperfocal subgroup is contained in the center of the unique essential subgroup in the fusion system. In particular, Alperin's weight conjecture holds in the considered cases.
