This paper answers a question raised by Grothendieck in 1970 on the "Grothendieck closure" of an integral linear group and proves a conjecture of the first author made in 1980. This is done by a detailed study of the congruence topology of arithmetic groups, obtaining along the way, an arithmetic analogue of a classical result of Chevalley for complex algebraic groups. As an application we also deduce a group theoretic characterization of thin subgroups of arithmetic groups.
