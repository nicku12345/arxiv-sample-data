Let \sigma =\{\sigma_{i} | i\in I\} be some partition of the set of all primes \Bbb{P} and let G be a finite group. Then G is said to be \sigma -full if G has a Hall \sigma _{i}-subgroup for all i. A subgroup A of G is said to be \sigma-permutable in G provided G is \sigma -full and A permutes with all Hall \sigma _{i}-subgroups H of G (that is, AH=HA) for all i. We obtain a characterization of finite groups G in which \sigma-permutability is a transitive relation in G, that is, if K is a {\sigma}-permutable subgroup of H and H is a {\sigma}-permutable subgroup of G, then K is a {\sigma}-permutable subgroup of G.
