Fix an equilateral triangle group T_i=\langle a, b; a^i, b^i, (ab)^i\rangle with i\geq6 arbitrary. Our main result is: for every presentation \mathcal{P} of every countable group Q there exists an HNN-extension T_{\mathcal{P}} of T_i such that \operatorname{Out}(T_{\mathcal{P}})\cong Q. We construct the HNN-extensions explicitly, and examples are given. The class of groups constructed have nice categorical and residual properties. In order to prove our main result we give a method for recognising malnormal subgroups of small cancellation groups, and we introduce the concept of "malcharacteristic" subgroups.
