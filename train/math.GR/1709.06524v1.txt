We prove that the group of almost-automorphisms of the infinite rooted regular d-ary tree \mathcal{T}_d arises naturally as the Thompson-like group of a so called d-ary cloning system. A similar phenomenon occurs for any Nekrashevych group V_d(G), for G\le Aut(\mathcal{T}_d) a self-similar group. We use this framework to expand on work of Belk and Matucci, who proved that the R\"over group, using the Grigorchuk group for G, is of type F_\infty. Namely, we find some natural conditions on subgroups of G to ensure that V_d(G) is of type F_\infty, and in particular we prove this for all G in the infinite family of \v{S}uni\'c groups. We also prove that if G is itself of type F_\infty then so is V_d(G), and that every finitely generated virtually free group is self-similar, so in particular every finitely generated virtually free group G yields a type F_\infty Nekrashevych group V_d(G).
