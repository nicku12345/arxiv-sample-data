In this paper we prove a sandwich classification theorem for subgroups of the classical symplectic group over an arbitrary commutative ring R that contain the elementary block-diagonal (or subsystem) subgroup \operatorname{Ep}(\nu, R) corresponding to a unitary equivalence realation \nu such that all self-conjugate equivalence classes of \nu are of size at least 4 and all not-self-conjugate classes of \nu are of size at least 5. Namely, given a subgroup H of \operatorname{Sp}(2n, R) such that \operatorname{Ep}(\nu, R) \le H we show that there exists a unique exact major form net of ideals (\sigma, \Gamma) over R such that \operatorname{Ep}(\sigma, \Gamma) \le H \le N_{\operatorname{Sp}(2n,R)}(\operatorname{Sp}(\sigma, \Gamma)). Further, we describe the normalizer N_{\operatorname{Sp}(2n,R)}(\operatorname{Sp}(\sigma, \Gamma)) in terms of congruences.
