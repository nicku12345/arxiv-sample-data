McCarthy's Theorem for the mapping class group of a closed hyperbolic surface states that for any two mapping classes \sigma,\tau \in \mathrm{Mod}(S) there is some power N such that the group \langle \sigma^N,\tau^N\rangle is either free of rank two or abelian, and gives a geometric criterion for the dichotomy. The analogous statement is false in linear groups, and unresolved for outer automorphisms of a free group. Several analogs are known for exponentially growing outer automorphisms satisfying various technical hypothesis. In this article we prove an analogous statement when \sigma and \tau are linearly growing outer automorphisms of F_r, and give a geometric criterion for the dichotomy. Further, Hamidi-Tehrani proved that for Dehn twists in the mapping class group this independence dichotomy is \emph{uniform}: N=4 suffices. In a similar style, we obtain an N that depends only on the rank of the free group.
