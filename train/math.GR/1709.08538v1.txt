Let A be an Artin group. A partition \mathcal{P} of the set of standard generators of A is called admissible if, for all X,Y \in \mathcal{P}, X \neq Y, there is at most one pair (s,t) \in X \times Y which has a relation. An admissible partition \mathcal{P} determines a quotient Coxeter graph \Gamma/\mathcal{P}. We prove that, if \Gamma/\mathcal{P} is either a forest or an even triangle free Coxeter graph and A_X is residually finite for all X \in \mathcal{P}, then A is residually finite.
