In 2014, Benjamin Nachman showed that when p\equiv1 mod 8, the 2-dimensional projective linear group over the field of p elements fails the replacement property if the maximal length m of an irredundant generating sequence for the group is 3. In addition, if m=4, the group satisfies the property for any prime p. In this paper, we will extend such classification for PSL(2,q) where q is p and p^2 with conditions of modulo 8 and 10 on p.
