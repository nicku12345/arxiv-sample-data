We completely classify all neutral or costandard elements in the lattice \mathbb{MON} of all monoid varieties. Further, we prove that an arbitrary upper-modular element of \mathbb{MON} except the variety of all monoids is either a completely regular or a commutative variety. Finally, we verify that all commutative varieties of monoids are codistributive elements of \mathbb{MON}. Thus, the problems of describing codistributive or upper-modular elements of \mathbb{MON} are completely reduced to the completely regular case.
