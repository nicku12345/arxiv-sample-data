For a free group \mathbb{F} of finite rank such that \text{rank}(\mathbb{F})\geq 3, we prove that the set of weak limits of a conjugacy class in \mathbb{F} under iterates of some hyperbolic \phi\in\mathsf{Out(\mathbb{F})} is equal to the collection of generic leaves and singular lines of \phi. As an application we describe the ending lamination set for a hyperbolic extension of \mathbb{F} by a hyperbolic subgroup of \mathsf{Out(\mathbb{F})} in a new way and use it to prove results about Cannon-Thurston maps for such extensions. We also use it to derive conditions for quasiconvexity of finitely generated, infinite index subgroups of \mathbb{F} in the extension group. These results generalize similar results obtained by Mahan Mj, Kapovich-Lustig and use different techniques.
