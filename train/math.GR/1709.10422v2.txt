Let G be a finite p-group whose derived subgroup G' can be generated by 2 elements. If G' is abelian, Guralnick proved that every element of G' is a commutator. In this paper, we prove that the condition that G' should be abelian is not needed. Even more, we prove that every element of G' is a commutator of the form [x,g] for a fixed x\in G.
