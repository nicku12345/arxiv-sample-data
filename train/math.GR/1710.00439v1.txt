It is shown that a flat subgroup, H, of the totally disconnected, locally compact group G decomposes into a finite number of subsemigroups on which the scale function is multiplicative. The image, P, of a multiplicative semigroup in the quotient, H/H(1), of H by its uniscalar subgroup has a unique minimal generating set which determines a natural Cayley graph structure on P. For each compact, open subgroup U of G, a graph is defined and it is shown that if P is multiplicative over U then this graph is a regular, rooted, strongly simple P-graph. This extends to higher rank the result of R. M\"oller that U is tidy for x if and only if a certain graph is a regular, rooted tree.
