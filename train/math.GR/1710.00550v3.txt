On the one hand, it is well known that the only subquadratic Dehn function of finitely presented groups is the linear one. On the other hand there is a huge class of Dehn functions d(n) with growth at least n^4 (essentially all possible such Dehn functions) constructed in \cite{SBR} and based on the time functions of Turing machines and S-machines. The class of Dehn functions n^{\alpha} with \alpha\in (2; 4) remained more mysterious even though it has attracted quite a bit of attention (see, for example, \cite{BB}). We fill the gap obtaining Dehn functions of the form n^{\alpha} (and much more) for all real \alpha\ge 2 computable in reasonable time, for example, \alpha=\pi or \alpha= e, or \alpha is any algebraic number. As in \cite{SBR}, we use S-machines but new tools and new way of proof are needed for the best possible lower bound d(n)\ge n^2.
