We establish a new sufficient condition under which a monoid is non-finitely based and apply this condition to show that the 9-element monoid L_4^1 is non-finitely based. The monoid L_4^1 was the only unsolved case in the finite basis problem for Lee monoids L_\ell^1, obtained by adjoining an identity element to the semigroup generated by two idempotents a and b subjected to the relation 0=abab \cdots (length \ell). We also prove a syntactic sufficient condition which is equivalent to the sufficient condition of Lee under which a semigroup is non-finitely based. This gives a new proof to the results of Zhang-Luo and Lee that the semigroup L_\ell is non-finitely based each \ell \ge 3.
