We describe subgroups and overgroups of the generalised Thompson groups V_n which arise via conjugation by rational homeomorphisms of Cantor space. We specifically consider conjugating V_n by homeomorphisms induced by synchronizing transducers and their inverses. Our descriptions of the subgroups and overgroups use properties of the conjugating transducer to either restrict or augment the action of V_n on Cantor space.
