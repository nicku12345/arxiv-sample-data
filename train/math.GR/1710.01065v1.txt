We study representations of the pure symmetric automorphism group PAut(A_\Gamma) of a RAAG A_\Gamma with defining graph \Gamma.   We first construct a homomorphism from PAut(A_\Gamma) to the direct product of a RAAG and a finite direct product of copies of F_2 \times F_2; moreover, the image of PAut(A_\Gamma) under this homomorphism is surjective onto each factor. As a consequence, we obtain interesting actions of PAut(A_\Gamma) on non-positively curved spaces   We then exhibit, for connected \Gamma, a RAAG which property contains Inn(A_\Gamma) and embeds as a normal subgroup of PAut(A_\Gamma). We end with a discussion of the linearity problem for PAut(A_\Gamma).
