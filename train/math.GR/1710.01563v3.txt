A classification of maximal subgroups of odd index in finite simple groups was given by Liebeck and Saxl and, independently, Kantor in 1980s. In the cases of alternating groups or classical groups of Lie type over fields of odd characteristics, the classification was not complete. The classification was completed by the author in 2008. In the cases of finite simple classical groups of Lie type we used results obtained in Kleidman's PhD thesis. However there is a number of flaws in this PhD thesis. The flaws were corrected by Bray, Holt, and Roney-Dougal in 2013. In this note we provide a revision of the classification of maximal subgroups of odd index in finite simple classical groups over fields of odd characteristics.
