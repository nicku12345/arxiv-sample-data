The theory of bounded cohomology of groups has many applications. A key open problem is to compute the full bounded cohomology H_b^n(F, R) of a non-abelian free group F with trivial real coefficients. It is known that H_b^n(F,R) is trivial for n=1 and uncountable dimensional for n=2,3, but remains unknown for any n \geq 4. For n=4, one may construct classes by taking the cup product \alpha \cup \beta \in H_b^4(F, R) between two 2-classes \alpha, \beta \in H^2_b(F, R). However, we show that all such cup products are trivial if \alpha and \beta are classes induced by the quasimorphisms defined by Brooks or Rolli.
