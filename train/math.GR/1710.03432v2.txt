Let k be a field of characteristic \neq 2. In this paper we study squares, cubes and their products in split and anisotropic groups of type A_1. In split case, we show that computing n^{\rm th} roots is equivalent to finding solutions of certain polynomial equations in at most two variables over the base field k. The description of these polynomials involves generalised Fibonacci polynomials. Using this we obtain asymptotic proportions of n^{\rm th} powers, and conjugacy classes which are n^{\rm th} powers, in {\rm SL}_2(\mathbb F_q) when n is a prime or n = 4.   We also extend already known Waring type result for {\rm SL}_2(\mathbb F_q), that every element of {\rm SL}_2(\mathbb F_q) is a product of two squares, to {\rm SL}_2(k) for an arbitrary k. For anisotropic groups of type A_1, namely {\rm SL}_1(Q) where Q is a quaternion division algebra, we prove that when 2 is a square in k, every element of {\rm SL}_1(Q) is a product of two squares if and only if -1 is a square in {\rm SL}_1(Q).
