Let us be given two graphs \Gamma_1, \Gamma_2 of n vertices. Are they isomorphic? If they are, the set of isomorphisms from \Gamma_1 to \Gamma_2 can be identified with a coset H\cdot\pi inside the symmetric group on n elements. How do we find \pi and a set of generators of H?   The challenge of giving an always efficient algorithm answering these questions remained open for a long time. Babai has recently shown how to solve these problems -- and others linked to them -- in quasi-polynomial time, i.e. in time \exp\left(O(\log n)^{O(1)}\right). His strategy is based in part on the algorithm by Luks (1980/82), who solved the case of graphs of bounded degree.
