Using cohomological methods, we prove a criterion for the embedding of a group extension with abelian kernel into the split extension of a co-induced module. This generalises some earlier similar results. We also prove an assertion about the conjugacy of complements in split extensions of co-induced modules. Both results follow from a relation between homomorphisms of certain cohomology groups.
