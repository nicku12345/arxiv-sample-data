Let p be a fixed prime. For a finite group generated by elements of order p, the p-width is defined to be the minimal k\in\mathbb{N} such that any group element can be written as a product of at most k elements of order p. Let A_{n} denote the alternating group of even permutations on n letters. We show that the p-width of A_{n} (n\geq p) is at most 3. This result is sharp, as there are families of alternating groups with p-width precisely 3, for each prime p.
