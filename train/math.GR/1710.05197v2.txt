For every group G, we introduce the set of hyperbolic structures on G, denoted \mathcal{H}(G), which consists of equivalence classes of (possibly infinite) generating sets of G such that the corresponding Cayley graph is hyperbolic; two generating sets of G are equivalent if the corresponding word metrics on G are bi-Lipschitz equivalent. Alternatively, one can define hyperbolic structures in terms of cobounded G-actions on hyperbolic spaces. We are especially interested in the subset \mathcal{AH}(G)\subseteq \mathcal{H}(G) of acylindrically hyperbolic structures on G, i.e., hyperbolic structures corresponding to acylindrical actions. Elements of \mathcal{H}(G) can be ordered in a natural way according to the amount of information they provide about the group G. The main goal of this paper is to initiate the study of the posets \mathcal{H}(G) and \mathcal{AH}(G) for various groups G. We discuss basic properties of these posets such as cardinality and existence of extremal elements, obtain several results about hyperbolic structures induced from hyperbolically embedded subgroups of G, and study to what extent a hyperbolic structure is determined by the set of loxodromic elements and their translation lengths.
