Let \sigma =\{\sigma_{i} | i\in I\} be a partition of the set of all primes \Bbb{P} and G a finite group. Let \sigma (G)=\{\sigma _{i} : \sigma _{i}\cap \pi (G)\ne \emptyset. A set {\cal H} of subgroups of G is said to be a complete Hall \sigma -set of G if every member \ne 1 of {\cal H} is a Hall \sigma _{i}-subgroup of G for some i\in I and \cal H contains exactly one Hall \sigma _{i}-subgroup of G for every i such that \sigma _{i}\in \sigma (G). We say that G is \sigma-full if G possesses a complete Hall \sigma -set. A complete Hall \sigma -set \cal H of G is said to be a \sigma-basis of G if every two subgroups A, B \in\cal H are permutable, that is, AB=BA. In this paper, we study properties of finite groups having a \sigma-basis. In particular, we prove that if G has a a \sigma-basis, then G is generalized \sigma-soluble, that is, G has a complete Hall \sigma -set and for every chief factor H/K of G we have |\sigma (H/K)|\leq 2. Moreover, answering to Problem 8.28 in [A.N. Skiba, On some results in the theory of finite partially soluble groups, Commun. Math. Stat., 4(3) (2016), 281--309], we prove the following Theorem A. Suppose that G is \sigma-full. Then every complete Hall \sigma-set of G forms a \sigma-basis of G if and only if G is generalized \sigma-soluble and for the automorphism group G/C_{G}(H/K), induced by G on any its chief factor H/K, we have either \sigma (H/K)=\sigma (G/C_{G}(H/K)) or \sigma (H/K) =\{\sigma _{i}\} and G/C_{G}(H/K) is a \sigma _{i} \cup \sigma _{j}-group for some i\ne j.
