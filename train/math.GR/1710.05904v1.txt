Direct powers of perfect groups admit more concise presentations than one might naively suppose. If H_1G=H_2G=0, then G^n has a presentation with O(\log n) generators and O(\log n)^3 relators. If, in addition, there is an element g\in G that has infinite order in every non-trivial quotient of G, then G^n has a presentation with d(G) +1 generators and O(\log n) relators. The bounds that we obtain on the deficiency of G^n are not monotone in n; this points to potential counterexamples for the Relation Gap Problem.
