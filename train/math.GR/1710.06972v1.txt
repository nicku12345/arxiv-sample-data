Jones introduced unitary representations for the Thompson groups F and T from a given subfactor planar algebra. Some interesting subgroups arise as the stabilizer of certain vector, in particular the Jones subgroups \vec{F} and \vec{T}. Golan and Sapir studied \vec{F} and identified it as a copy of the Thompson group F_3. In this paper we completely describe \vec{T} and show that \vec{T} coincides with its commensurator in T, implying that the corresponding unitary representation is irreducible. We also generalize the notion of the Stallings 2-core for diagram groups to T, showing that \vec{T} and T_3 are not isomorphic, but as annular diagram groups they have very similar presentations.
