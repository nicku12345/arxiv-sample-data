An \mathcal{F}-essential subgroup is called a pearl if it is either elementary abelian of order p^2 or non-abelian of order p^3. In this paper we start the investigation of fusion systems containing pearls: we determine a bound for the order of p-groups containing pearls and we classify the saturated fusion systems on p-groups containing pearls and having sectional rank at most 4.
