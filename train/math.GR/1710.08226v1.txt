Following Isaacs (see [Isa08, p. 94]), we call a normal subgroup N of a finite group G large, if C_G(N) \leq N, so that N has bounded index in G. Our principal aim here is to establish some general results for systematically producing large subgroups in finite groups (see Theorems A and C). We also consider the more specialised problems of finding large (non-abelian) nilpotent as well as abelian subgroups in soluble groups.
