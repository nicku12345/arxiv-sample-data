We extend the concepts of antimorphism and antiautomorphism of the additive group of integers modulo n, given by Gaitanas Konstantinos, to abelian groups. We give a lower bound for the number of antiautomorphisms of cyclic groups of odd order and give an exact formula for the number of linear antiautomorphisms of cyclic groups of odd order. Finally, we give a partial classification of the finite abelian groups which admit antiautomorphisms and state some open questions.
