We show that an outer automorphism acts loxodromically on the cyclic splitting complex if and only if it has a filling lamination and no generic leaf of the lamination is carried by a vertex group of a cyclic splitting. This is the analog for the cyclic splitting complex of Handel-Mosher's theorem on loxodromics for the free splitting complex. We also show that such outer automorphisms have virtually cyclic centralizers.
