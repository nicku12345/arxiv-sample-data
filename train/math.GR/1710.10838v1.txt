L. Babai has shown that a faithful permutation representation of a nonsplit extension of a group by an alternating group A_k must have degree at least k^2(\frac{1}{2}-o(1)), and has asked how sharp this lower bound is. We prove that Babai's bound is sharp (up to a constant factor), by showing that there are such nonsplit extensions that have faithful permutation representations of degree \frac{3}{2}k(k-1). We also reprove Babai's quadratic lower bound with the constant \frac{1}{2} improved to 1 (by completely different methods).
