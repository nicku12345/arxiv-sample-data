In this paper we exhibit Morse geodesics, often called "hyperbolic directions", in infinite unbounded torsion groups. The groups studied are lacunary hyperbolic groups and constructed using graded small cancellation conditions. In all previously known examples, Morse geodesics were found in groups which also contained Morse elements, infinite order elements whose cyclic subgroup gives a Morse quasi-geodesic. Our result presents the first example of a group which contains Morse geodesics but no Morse elements. In fact, we show that there is an isometrically embedded 7-regular tree inside such groups where every infinite, simple path is a Morse geodesic.
