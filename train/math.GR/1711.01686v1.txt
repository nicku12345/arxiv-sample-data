Let \mathfrak{J} be a class of non-abelian simple groups and \mathfrak{X} be a class of groups. A chief factor H/K of a group G is called \mathfrak{X}-central in G provided (H/K)\rtimes G/C_G(H/K)\in\mathfrak{X}. We say that G is a \mathfrak{J}cs-\mathfrak{X}-\emph{group} if every chief \mathfrak{X}-factor of G is \mathfrak{X}-central and other chief factors of G are simple \mathfrak{J}-groups. We use \mathfrak{X}_{\mathfrak{J}cs} to denote the class of all \mathfrak{J}cs-\mathfrak{X}-groups. A subgroup U of a group G is called \mathfrak{X}-\emph{maximal} in G provided that (a) U\in\mathfrak{X}, and (b) if U\leq V \leq G and V\in\mathfrak{X}, then U = V. In this paper we described the structure of \mathfrak{J}cs-\mathfrak{H}-groups for a solubly saturated formation \mathfrak{H} and all hereditary saturated formations \mathfrak{F} containing all nilpotent groups such that the \mathfrak{F}_{\mathfrak{J}cs}-hypercenter of G coincides with the intersection of all \mathfrak{F}_{\mathfrak{J}cs}-maximal subgroups of G for every group G.
