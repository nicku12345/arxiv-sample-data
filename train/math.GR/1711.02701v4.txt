Let n >3 and  0< k < \frac{n}{2}  be integers. In this paper, we investigate some algebraic properties of the line graph of the graph  {Q_n}(k,k+1)  where  {Q_n}(k,k+1)  is the subgraph of the hypercube Q_n which is induced by the set of vertices of weights k and k+1. In the first step, we determine the automorphism groups of these graphs for all values of n,k. In the second step, we study Cayley properties of the line graphs of these graphs. In particular, we show that if k\geq 3 and  n \neq 2k+1, then except for the cases k=3, n=9 and k=3, n=33, the line graph of the graph  {Q_n}(k,k+1)  is a vertex-transitive non-Cayley graph. Also, we show that the line graph of the graph  {Q_n}(1,2)  is a Cayley graph if and only if  n is a power of a prime p. Moreover, we show that for \lq{}almost all\rq{} even values of k, the line graph of the graph  {Q_{2k+1}}(k,k+1)  is a vertex-transitive non-Cayley graph.
