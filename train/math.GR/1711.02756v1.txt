Let S be a p-group for an odd prime p, Oliver proposed the conjecture that the Thompson subgroup J(S) is always contained in the Oliver subgroup \mathfrak{X}(S). That means he conjectured that |J(S)\mathfrak{X}(S):\mathfrak{X}(S)|=1. Let \mathfrak{X}_1(S) be a subgroup of S such that \mathfrak{X}_1(S)/\mathfrak{X}(S) is the center of S/\mathfrak{X}(S). In this short note, we prove that J(S)\leq \mathfrak{X}(S) if and only if J(S)\leq \mathfrak{X}_1(S).   As an easy application, we prove that   |J(S)\mathfrak{X}(S):\mathfrak{X}(S)|\neq p.
