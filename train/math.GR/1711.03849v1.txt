We devise a method for computing representation zeta functions of torsion-free finitely generated 2-nilpotent groups whose associated Lie lattices have an extra smoothness condition. This method is used first to derive intrinsic formulae for the abscissa of convergence of such representation zeta functions; and secondly, as a practical application, to compute global, local and topological representation zeta functions of groups within an infinite family containing the Heisenberg group over rings of integers in number fields.
