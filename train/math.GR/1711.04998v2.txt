Let p be an odd prime and let G be a non-abelian finite p-group of exponent p^2 with three distinct characteristic subgroups, namely 1, G^p, and G. The quotient group G/G^p gives rise to an anti-commutative {\mathbb F}_p-algebra L such that the action of {\rm Aut}(L) is irreducible on L; we call such an algebra IAC. This paper establishes a duality G\leftrightarrow L between such groups and such IAC algebras. We prove that IAC algebras are semisimple and we classify the simple IAC algebras of dimension at most 4 over certain fields. We also give other examples of simple IAC algebras, including a family related to the m-th symmetric power of the natural module of {\rm SL}(2,{\mathbb F}).
