A graph \Gamma labelled by a set S defines a group G(\Gamma) whose generators are the set of labels S and whose relations are all words which can be read on closed paths of this graph. We introduce the notion of aspherical graph and prove that such a graph defines an aspherical group presentation. This result generalizes a theorem of Dominik Gruber on graphs satisfying graphical C(6)-condition and also allows to get new graphical conditions of asphericity analogous to some classical conditions.
