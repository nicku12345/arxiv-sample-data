Let G be a central product of two groups H and K. We study second cohomology group of G, having coefficients in a divisible abelian group D with trivial G-action, in terms of the second cohomology groups of certain quotients of H and K. In particular, for D = \mathbb{C}^{*}, some of our results provide a refinement of results from [Some groups with non-trivial multiplicators, Math. Z. {\bf 120 } (1971), 307-308] and [On the Schur multiplicator of a central quotient of a direct product of groups, J. Pure Appl. Algebra {\bf 3} (1973), 73-82].
