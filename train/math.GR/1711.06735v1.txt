We show that every polynomial in \mathbb Z[x] defines an endomorphism of the d-ary rooted tree induced by its action on the ring \mathbb Z_d of d-adic integers. The sections of this endomorphism also turn out to be induced by polynomials in \mathbb Z[x] of the same degree. In the case of permutational polynomials acting on \mathbb Z_d by bijections the induced endomorphisms are automorphisms of the tree. In the case of \mathbb Z_2 such polynomials were completely characterized by Rivest. As our main application we utilize the result of Rivest to derive the condition on the coefficients of a permutational polynomial f(x)\in\mathbb Z[x] that is necessary and sufficient for f to induce a level transitive automorphism of the binary tree, which is equivalent to the ergodicity of the action of f(x) on \mathbb Z_2 with respect to the normalized Haar measure.
