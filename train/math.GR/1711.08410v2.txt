We introduce a class of countable groups by some abstract group-theoretic conditions. It includes linear groups with finite amenable radical and finitely generated residually finite groups with some non-vanishing \ell^2-Betti numbers that are not virtually a product of two infinite groups. Further, it includes acylindrically hyperbolic groups. For any group \Gamma in this class we determine the general structure of its possible lattice embeddings, i.e. of all compactly generated, locally compact groups that contain \Gamma as a lattice. This leads to a precise description of possible non-uniform lattice embeddings of groups in this class. Further applications include the determination of possible lattice embeddings of fundamental groups of closed manifolds with pinched negative curvature.
