We extend the characterization of abelian groups with ramification structures given by Garion and Penegini to finite nilpotent groups whose Sylow p-subgroups have a `nice power structure', including regular p-groups, powerful p-groups and (generalized) p-central p-groups. We also correct two errors in the result of Garion and Penegini regarding abelian 2-groups with ramification structures and the relation between the sizes of ramification structures for an abelian group and those for its Sylow 2-subgroup.
