For every pair of positive integers p > q we construct a one-relator group R_{p,q} whose Dehn function is \simeq n^{2 \alpha} where \alpha = \log_2(2p / q). The group R_{p,q} has no subgroup isomorphic to a Baumslag-Solitar group BS(m,n) with m \neq \pm n, but is not automatic, not CAT(0), and cannot act freely on a CAT(0) cube complex. This answers a long-standing question on the automaticity of one-relator groups and gives counterexamples to a conjecture of Wise.
