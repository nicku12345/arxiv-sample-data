We construct the type-preserving panel-regular lattices in buildings of type M, for M with entries two, three or infinity, which have cyclic stabilizers of spherical 2-residues. We obtain these lattices as fundamental groups of their associated quotient buildings, which are constructed by amalgamating quotients of generalized digons and triangles by actions of Singer cyclic groups. Each quotient construction has an associated gluing matrix which encodes how the quotient generalized polygons are amalgamated. We show that these gluing matrices also encode presentations of the panel-regular lattices.
