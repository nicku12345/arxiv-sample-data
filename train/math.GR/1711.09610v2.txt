We study the scale and tidy subgroups of an endomorphism of a totally disconnected locally compact group using a geometric framework. This leads to new interpretations of tidy subgroups and the scale function. Foremost, we obtain a geometric tidying procedure which applies to endomorphisms as well as a geometric proof of the fact that tidiness is equivalent to being minimizing for a given endomorphism. Our framework also yields an endomorphism version of the Baumgartner-Willis tree representation theorem. We conclude with a construction of new endomorphisms of totally disconnected locally compact groups from old via HNN-extensions.
