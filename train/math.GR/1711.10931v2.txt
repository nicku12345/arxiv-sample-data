In this paper we provide a procedure to obtain a non-trivial HHS structure on a hyperbolic space. In particular, we prove that given a finite collection \mathcal{F} of quasi-convex subgroups of a hyperbolic group G, there is an HHG structure on G that is compatible with \mathcal{F}. We will use this to provide explicit descriptions of the Gromov Boundary of hyperbolic HHS and HHG, and we recover results from Hamenst\"adt, Manning, Trang for the case when G is hyperbolic relative to \mathcal{F}. Further applications in the construction of new HHG will be presented in a subsequent paper.
