We show that certain right-angled Coxeter groups have finite index subgroups that quotient to \mathbb Z with finitely generated kernels. The proof uses Bestvina-Brady Morse theory facilitated by combinatorial arguments. We describe a variety of examples where the plan succeeds or fails. Among the successful examples are the right-angled reflection groups in \mathbb H^4 with fundamental domain the 120-cell or the 24-cell.
