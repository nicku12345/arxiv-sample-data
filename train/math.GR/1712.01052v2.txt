In these notes we will survey recent results on various finitary approximation properties of infinite groups. We will discuss various restrictions on groups that are approximated for example by finite solvable groups or finite-dimensional unitary groups with the Frobenius metric. Towards the end, we also briefly discuss various applications of those approximation properties to the understanding of the equational theory of a group.
