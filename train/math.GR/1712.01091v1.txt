Let \Gamma \leq \mathrm{Aut}(T_{d_1}) \times \mathrm{Aut}(T_{d_2}) be a group acting freely and transitively on the product of two regular trees of degree d_1 and d_2. We develop an algorithm which computes the closure of the projection of \Gamma on \mathrm{Aut}(T_{d_t}) under the hypothesis that d_t \geq 6 is even and that the local action of \Gamma on T_{d_t} contains \mathrm{Alt}(d_t). We show that if \Gamma is torsion-free and d_1 = d_2 = 6, exactly seven closed subgroups of \mathrm{Aut}(T_6) arise in this way. We also construct two new infinite families of virtually simple lattices in \mathrm{Aut}(T_{6}) \times \mathrm{Aut}(T_{4n}) and in \mathrm{Aut}(T_{2n}) \times \mathrm{Aut}(T_{2n+1}) respectively, for all n \geq 2. In particular we provide an explicit presentation of a torsion-free infinite simple group on 5 generators and 10 relations, that splits as an amalgamated free product of two copies of F_3 over F_{11}. We include information arising from computer-assisted exhaustive searches of lattices in products of trees of small degrees. In an appendix by Pierre-Emmanuel Caprace, some of our results are used to show that abstract and relative commensurator groups of free groups are almost simple, providing partial answers to questions of Lubotzky and Lubotzky-Mozes-Zimmer.
