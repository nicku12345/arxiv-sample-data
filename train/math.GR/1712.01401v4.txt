Given a permutational wreath product sequence of cyclic groups of prime order we research a commutator width of such groups and some properties of its commutator subgroup.   Commutator width of Sylow 2-subgroups of alternating group A_{2^{k}}, permutation group S_{2^k} and C_p \wr B were founded. The result of research was extended on subgroups (Syl_2 {A_{2^k}})', p>2. The paper presents a construction of commutator subgroup of Sylow 2-subgroups of symmetric and alternating groups. Also minimal generic sets of Sylow 2-subgroups of A_{2^k} were founded. Elements presentation of (Syl_2 {A_{2^k}})', (Syl_2 {S_{2^k}})' was investigated. We prove that the commutator width \cite {Mur} of an arbitrary element of a discrete wreath product of cyclic groups C_p is 1. Key words: wreath product of group, commutator width of p-Sylow subgroups, commutator subgroup, centralizer subgroup, semidirect product.
