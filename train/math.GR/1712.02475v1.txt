Functions between groups with the property that all function con- jugates are inverse preserving are called sandwich morphisms. These maps pre- serve a structure within the group known as the sandwich structure. Sandwich structures are left distributive idempotent left involutary magmas. These pro- vide a generalisation of groups which we call a sandwich. This paper explores sandwiches and their relationship to groups.
