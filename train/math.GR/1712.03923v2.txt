Whiston proved that the maximum size of an irredundant generating set in the symmetric group S_n is n-1, and Cameron and Cara characterized all irredundant generating sets of S_n that achieve this size. Our goal is to extend their results. Using properties of transitive subgroups of the symmetric group, we are able to classify all irredundant generating sets with sizes n-2 in both A_n and S_n. Next, based on this classification, we derive other interesting properties for the alternating group A_n. Finally, using Whiston's lemma, we will derive the formulas for calculating dimension-like invariants of some specific types of wreath products.
