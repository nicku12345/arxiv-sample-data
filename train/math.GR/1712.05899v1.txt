Let T be a finite simple group of Lie type in characteristic p, and let S be a Sylow subgroup of T with maximal order. It is well known that S is a Sylow p-subgroup except in an explicit list of exceptions, and that S is always `large' in the sense that |T|^{1/3} < |S| \leqslant |T|^{1/2}. One might anticipate that, moreover, the Sylow r-subgroups of T with r \neq p are usually significantly smaller than S. We verify this hypothesis by proving that for every T and every prime divisor r of |T| with r \neq p, the order of the Sylow r-subgroup of T at most |T|^{2\lfloor\log_r(4(\ell+1) r)\rfloor/\ell}=|T|^{{\rm O}(\log_r(\ell)/\ell)}, where \ell is the Lie rank of T.
