Automorphic loops are loops in which all inner mappings are automorphisms. A large class of automorphic loops is obtained as follows: Let m be a positive even integer, G an abelian group, and \alpha an automorphism of G that satisfies \alpha^2=1 if m>2. Then the dihedral-like automorphic loop \mathrm{Dih}(m,G,\alpha) is defined on \mathbb Z_m\times G by (i,u)(j,v)=(i+j, ((-1)^{j}u+v)\alpha^{ij}). We prove that two finite dihedral-like automorphic loops \mathrm{Dih}(m,G,\alpha), \mathrm{Dih}(\overline{m},\overline{G},\overline{\alpha}) are isomorphic if and only if m=\overline{m}, G=\overline{G}, and \alpha is conjugate to \overline{\alpha} in the automorphism group of G. Moreover, for a finite dihedral-like automorphic loop Q we describe the structure of the automorphism group of Q and its subgroup consisting of inner mappings of Q.
