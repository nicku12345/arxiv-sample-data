A loop is automorphic if all its inner mappings are automorphisms. We construct a large family of automorphic loops as follows. Let R be a commutative ring, V an R-module, E=\mathrm{End}_R(V) the ring of R-endomorphisms of V, and W a subgroup of (E,+) such that ab=ba for every a, b\in W and 1+a is invertible for every a\in W. Then Q_{R,V}(W) defined on W\times V by (a,u)(b,v) = (a+b,u(1+b)+v(1-a)) is an automorphic loop.   A special case occurs when R=k<K=V is a field extension and W is a k-subspace of K such that k1\cap W = 0, naturally embedded into \mathrm{End}_k(K) by a\mapsto M_a, bM_a = ba. In this case we denote the automorphic loop Q_{R,V}(W) by Q_{k<K}(W).   We call the parameters tame if k is a prime field, W generates K as a field over k, and K is perfect when \mathrm{char}(k)=2. We describe the automorphism groups of tame automorphic loops Q_{k<K}(W), and we solve the isomorphism problem for tame automorphic loops Q_{k<K}(W). A special case solves a problem about automorphic loops of order p^3 posed by Jedli\v{c}ka, Kinyon and Vojt\v{e}chovsk\'y.   We conclude the paper with a construction of an infinite 2-generated abelian-by-cyclic automorphic loop of prime exponent.
