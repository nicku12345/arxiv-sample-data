We describe the structure of E-dense acts over E-dense semigroups in an analogous way to that for inverse semigroup acts over inverse semigroups. This is based, to a large extent, on the work of Schein on representations of inverse semigroups by partial one-to-one maps. We consider an application to the discrete log problem in cryptography as well as an application to the same problem using completely regular semigroups.
