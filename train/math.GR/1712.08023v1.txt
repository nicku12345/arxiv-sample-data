The branching theorem expresses irreducible character values for the symmetric group S_n in terms of those for S_{n-1}, but it gives the values only at elements of S_n having a fixed point. We extend the theorem by providing a recursion formula that handles the remaining cases. It expresses these character values in terms of values for S_{n-1} together with values for S_n that are already known in the recursive process. This provides an alternative to the Murnaghan-Nakayama formula.
