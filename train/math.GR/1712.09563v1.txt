It is well known that the normaliser of a parabolic subgroup of a finite Coxeter group is the semidirect product of the parabolic subgroup by the stabiliser of a set of simple roots. We show that a similar result holds for all finite unitary reflection groups: namely, the normaliser of a parabolic subgroup is a semidirect product and in many, but not all, cases the complement can be obtained as the stabiliser of a set of roots. In addition we record when the complement acts as a reflection group on the space of fixed points of the parabolic subgroup.
