We show that the semidirect product of a group C by A*_D B is isomorphic to the free product of A\rtimes C and B\rtimes C amalgamated at D\rtimes C, where A, B and C are arbitrary groups. Moreover, we apply this theorem to prove that any group G that acts without inversion on a tree T that possesses a segment \Gamma for its quotient graph, such that, if the stabilizers of the vertex set \{\,P,Q\,\} and edge y of a lift of \, \Gamma in T are of the form G_{P}\!\rtimes H, G_{Q}\!\rtimes H and G_{y}\! \rtimes H, then G is isomorphic to the semidirect product of H by (\,G_P \,*_{G_y} \,G_Q \,).   Using our results we conclude with a non-standard verification of the isomorphism between GL_2(\mathbb{Z}) and the free product of the dihedral groups D_4 and D_6 amalgamated at their Klein-four group.
