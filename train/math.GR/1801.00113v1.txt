Let G be a group, m\geq2 and n\geq1. We say that G is an \mathcal{T}(m,n)-group if for every m subsets X_1, X_2, \dots, X_m of G of cardinality n, there exists i\neq j and x_i \in X_i, x_j \in X_j such that x_ix_j=x_jx_i. In this paper, we give some examples of finite and infinite non-abelian \mathcal{T}(m,n)-groups and we discuss finiteness and commutativity of such groups. We also show solvability length of a solvable \mathcal{T}(m,n)-group is bounded in terms of m and n.
