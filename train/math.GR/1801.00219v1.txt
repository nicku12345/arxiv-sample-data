Let G be an affine algebraic group with a reductive identity component G^{0} acting regularly on an affine Krull scheme X = {Spec} (R) over an algebraically closed field. Let T be an algebraic subtorus of G and suppose that {Q}(R)^{T}= {Q}(R^{T}) of quotient fields. We will show: If G is the centralizer of T in G, then the pseudo-reflections of the action of G on R^{T} can be lifted to those on R.
