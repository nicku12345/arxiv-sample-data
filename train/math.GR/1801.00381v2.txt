We extend Borel's theorem on the dominance of word maps from semisimple algebraic groups to some perfect groups. In another direction, we generalize Borel's theorem to some words with constants. We also consider the surjectivity problem for particular words and groups, give a brief survey of recent results, present some generalizations and variations and discuss various approaches, with emphasis on new ideas, constructions and connections.
