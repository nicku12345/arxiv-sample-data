Generalizing results of Higman and Houghton on varieties generated by wreath products of finite cycles, we prove that the (direct or cartesian) wreath product of arbitrary abelian groups A and B generates the product variety var (A) \cdot var (B) if and only if one of the groups A and B is not of finite exponent, or if A and B are of finite exponents m and n respectively and for all primes p dividing both m and n, the factors B[p^k]/B[p^{k-1}] are infinite, where B[s]=\langle b\in B|\,b^{s}=1 \rangle and where p^k is the highest power of p dividing n.
