Let G be a non-compact semisimple Lie group with finite centre and finitely many components. We show that any finitely generated group \Gamma which is quasi-isometric to an irreducible lattice in G has the R_\infty-property, namely, that there are infinitely \phi-twisted conjugacy classes for every automorphism \phi of \Gamma. Also, we show that any lattice in G has the R_\infty-property, extending our earlier result for irreducible lattices.
