Dolfi, Guralnick, Praeger and Spiga asked if there exist infinitely many primitive groups of twisted wreath type with nontrivial coprime subdegrees. Here we settle this question in the affirmative. We construct infinite families of primitive twisted wreath permutation groups with nontrivial coprime subdegrees. In particular, we define a primitive twisted wreath group G(m,q) constructed from the nonabelian simple group \text{PSL}(2,q) and a primitive permutation group of diagonal type with socle \text{PSL}(2,q)^m, and determine all values of m and q for which G(m,q) has nontrivial coprime subdegrees. In the case where m=2 and q\notin\{7,11,29\} we obtain a full classification of all pairs of nontrivial coprime subdegrees.
