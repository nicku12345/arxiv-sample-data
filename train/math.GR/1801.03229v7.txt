Let G=\mathbf{Z}_{p} \oplus \mathbf{Z}_{p^2}, where p is a prime number. Suppose that d is a divisor of the order of G. In this paper we find the number of automorphisms of G fixing d elements of G, and denote it by \theta(G,d). As a consequence, we prove a conjecture of Checco-Darling-Longfield-Wisdom. We also find the exact number of fixed-point-free automorphisms of the group \mathbf{Z}_{p^{a}} \oplus \mathbf{Z}_{p^{b}}, where a and b are positive integers with a<b. Finally, we compute \theta(D_{2q},d), where D_{2q} is the dihedral group of order 2q, q is an odd prime and d \in \{1,q,2q\}.
