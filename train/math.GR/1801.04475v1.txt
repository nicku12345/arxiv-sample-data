We consider the class \mathcal{R} of finitely generated toral relatively hyperbolic groups. We show that groups from \mathcal{R} are commutative transitive and generalize a theorem proved by Benjamin Baumslag to this class. We also discuss two definitions of (fully) residually-\mathcal{C} groups and prove the equivalence of the two definitions for \mathcal{C}=\mathcal{R}. This is a generalization of the similar result obtained by Ol'shanskii for \mathcal{C} being the class of torsion-free hyperbolic groups. Let \Gamma\in\mathcal{R} be non-abelian and non-elementary. We prove that every finitely generated fully residually-\Gamma group embeds into a group from \mathcal{R}. On the other hand, we give an example of a finitely generated torsion-free fully residually-\mathcal{H} group that does not embed into a group from \mathcal{R}; \mathcal{H} is the class of hyperbolic groups.
