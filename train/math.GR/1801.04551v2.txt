An algebraic structure is said to be congruence permutable if its arbitrary congruences \alpha and \beta satisfy the equation \alpha \circ \beta =\beta \circ \alpha, where \circ denotes the usual composition of binary relations. For an arbitrary G-set X with G\cap X=\emptyset, we define a semigroup (G,X,0) with a zero 0 (0\notin G\cup X), and give necessary and sufficient conditions for the congruence permutability of the G-set X by the help of the semigroup (G,X,0).
