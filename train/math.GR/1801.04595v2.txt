Let p be a prime and let G be a subgroup of a Sylow pro-p subgroup of the group of automorphisms of the p-adic tree. We prove that if G is fractal and |G':\mathrm{st}_G(1)'|=\infty, then the set L(G) of left Engel elements of G is trivial. This result applies to fractal nonabelian groups with torsion-free abelianization, for example the Basilica group, the Brunner-Sidki-Vieira group, and also to the GGS-group with constant defining vector.   We further provide two examples showing that neither of the requirements |G':\mathrm{st}_G(1)'|=\infty and being fractal can be dropped.
