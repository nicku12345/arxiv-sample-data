In this paper we give sufficient conditions for a free product of residually finite groups to admit an embeddable box space. This generalizes the constructions of Arzhantseva, Guentner and Spakula in arXiv:1101.1993v2 and gives a new class of non-amenable metric spaces with bounded geometry which coarsely embeds into Hilbert space.
