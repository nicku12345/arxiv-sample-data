This text is the preprint version of the concluding chapter for the book New Directions in Locally Compact Groups published by Cambridge University Press in the series Lecture Notes of the LMS. The recent progress on locally compact groups surveyed in that volume also reveals the considerable extent of the unexplored territories. Therefore, we wish to conclude it by mentioning a few open problems related to the material covered in the book and that we consider important at the time of this writing.
