In this paper we revisit two concepts which were originally introduced by Aschbacher and are crucial in the theory of saturated fusion systems: Firstly, we give a new approach to defining the centralizer of a normal subsystem. Secondly, we revisit the construction of the product of two normal subsystems which centralize each other.
