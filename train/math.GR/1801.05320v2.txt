Given a universal elementary Chevalley-Demazure group E_\Phi^{sc}(R) for which its (standard) parabolic subgroups are finitely generated, we consider the problem of classifying which parabolics P(R) \subset E_\Phi^{sc}(R) are finitely presented. We show that, under mild assumptions, this is equivalent to the finite presentability of a suitable retract of P which contains the Levi factor. If the base ring R is a Dedekind domain of arithmetic type, we combine our results with well-known theorems due to Borel-Serre, Abels, Behr and Bux to give a partial classification of finitely presentable S-arithmetic subgroups of parabolics in split reductive linear algebraic groups.
