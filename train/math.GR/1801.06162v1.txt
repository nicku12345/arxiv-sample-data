We obtain sufficient criteria for endomorphisms of torsion-free nilpotent groups of finite rank to be automorphisms, by considering the induced maps on the torsion-free abelianisation and the centre. Whilst these results are known in the finitely generated case removing this assumption introduces several difficulties.
