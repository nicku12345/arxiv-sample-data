It is an open question in the study of Chermak-Delgado lattices precisely which finite groups G have the property that CD(G) is a chain of length 0. In this note, we determine two classes of groups with this property. We prove that if G=AB is a finite group, where A and B are abelian subgroups of relatively prime orders with A normal in G, then the Chermak-Delgado lattice of G equals \{AC_B(A)\}, a strengthening of earlier known results.
