It is a long-standing open problem raised by Starostin to describe all finite groups with soluble centralizers of involutions. One can observe that if the centralizer fusion system of an involution is nilpotent, then the centralizer of that involution is soluble. In this paper, we classify the cases when the centralizer fusion system of a central involution in a finite group whose all involutions have soluble centralizers is a nilpotent fusion system. Indeed, we analyse the case when the solvable radical has odd order and the corresponding factor group is simple.
