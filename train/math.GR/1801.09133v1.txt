In this paper we show that there is an infinite number of finite groups with two relative subgroup commutativity degrees. Also, we indicate a sufficient condition such that a finite group has at least three relative subgroup commutativity degrees and we prove that D_6 is the only finite dihedral group with two relative commutativity degrees. Finally, we study the density of the set containing all subgroup commutativity degrees of finite groups.
