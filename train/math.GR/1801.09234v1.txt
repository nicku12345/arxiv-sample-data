Let G be a finite group and \sigma =\{\sigma_{i} | i\in I\} some partition of the set of all primes \Bbb{P}, that is, \sigma =\{\sigma_{i} | i\in I \}, where \Bbb{P}=\bigcup_{i\in I} \sigma_{i} and \sigma_{i}\cap \sigma_{j}= \emptyset  for all i\ne j. We say that G is \sigma-primary if G is a \sigma _{i}-group for some i. A subgroup A of G is said to be: {\sigma}-subnormal in G if there is a subgroup chain A=A_{0} \leq A_{1} \leq \cdots \leq A_{n}=G such that either A_{i-1}\trianglelefteq A_{i} or A_{i}/(A_{i-1})_{A_{i}} is \sigma-primary for all i=1, \ldots, n, modular in G if the following conditions hold: (i) \langle X, A \cap Z \rangle=\langle X, A \rangle \cap Z for all X \leq G, Z \leq G such that X \leq Z, and (ii) \langle A, Y \cap Z \rangle=\langle A, Y \rangle \cap Z for all Y \leq G, Z \leq G such that A \leq Z. In this paper, a subgroup A of G is called \sigma-quasinormal in G if L is modular and {\sigma}-subnormal in G. We study \sigma-quasinormal subgroups of G. In particular, we prove that if a subgroup H of G is \sigma-quasinormal in G, then for every chief factor H/K of G between H^{G} and H_{G} the semidirect product (H/K)\rtimes (G/C_{G}(H/K)) is \sigma-primary.
