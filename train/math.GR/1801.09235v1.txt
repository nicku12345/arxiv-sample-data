Let \sigma =\{\sigma_{i} | i\in I\} be a partition of the set \Bbb{P} of all primes and G a finite group. A chief factor H/K of G is said to be \sigma-central if the semidirect product (H/K)\rtimes (G/C_{G}(H/K)) is a \sigma_{i}-group for some i=i(H/K). G is called \sigma-nilpotent if every chief factor of G is \sigma-central. We say that G is semi-{\sigma}-nilpotent (respectively weakly semi-{\sigma}-nilpotent) if the normalizer N_{G}(A) of every non-normal (respectively every non-subnormal) \sigma-nilpotent subgroup A of G is \sigma-nilpotent. In this paper we determine the structure of finite semi-{\sigma}-nilpotent and weakly semi-{\sigma}-nilpotent groups.
