When studying subgroups of Out(F_n), one often replaces a given subgroup H with one of its finite index subgroups H_0 so that virtual properties of H become actual properties of H_0. In many cases, the finite index subgroup is H_0 = H \cap IA_n(Z/3). For which properties is this a good choice? Our main theorem states that being abelian is such a property. Namely, every virtually abelian subgroup of IA_n(Z/3) is abelian.
