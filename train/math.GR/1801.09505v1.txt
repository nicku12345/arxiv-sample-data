We show a dichotomy for groups of cardinality less than continuum. The number of homomorphisms from the Hawaiian earring group to such a group G is either the cardinality of G in case G is noncommutatively slender, or the number is 2^{2^{\aleph_0}} in case G is not noncommutatively slender. An example of a noncommutatively slender group with nontrivial divisible element is exhibited.
