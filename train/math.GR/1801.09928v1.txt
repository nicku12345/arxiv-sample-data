A subset \left\{x_{1},x_{2},\hdots,x_{d}\right\} of a group G \emph{invariably generates} G if \left\{x_{1}^{g_{1}},x_{2}^{g_{2}},\hdots,x_{d}^{g_{d}}\right\} generates G for every d-tuple (g_{1},g_{2}\hdots,g_{d})\in G^{d}. We prove that a finite completely reducible linear group of dimension n can be invariably generated by \left\lfloor \frac{3n}{2}\right\rfloor elements. We also prove tighter bounds when the field in question has order 2 or 3. Finally, we prove that a transitive [respectively primitive] permutation group of degree n\geq 2 [resp. n\geq 3] can be invariably generated by O\left(\frac{n}{\sqrt{\log{n}}}\right) [resp. O\left(\frac{\log{n}}{\sqrt{\log{\log{n}}}}\right)] elements.
