Let C_1,\ldots,C_e be noncentral conjugacy classes of the algebraic group G=SL_n(k) defined over a sufficiently large field k, and let \Omega:=C_1\times \ldots \times C_e. This paper determines necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of a tuple (x_1,\ldots,x_e)\in\Omega such that \langle x_1,\ldots,x_e\rangle is Zariski dense in G. As a consequence, a new result concerning generic stabilizers in linear representations of algebraic groups is proved, and existing results on random (r,s)-generation of finite groups of Lie type are strengthened.
