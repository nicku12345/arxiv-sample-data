The set of idempotents of any semigroup carries the structure of a biordered set, which contains a great deal of information concerning the idempotent generated subsemigroup of the semigroup in question. This leads to the construction of a free idempotent generated semigroup \mathsf{IG}(\mathcal{E}) - the `free-est' semigroup with a given biordered set \mathcal{E} of idempotents. We show that when \mathcal{E} is finite, the word problem for \mathsf{IG}(\mathcal{E}) is equivalent to a family of constraint satisfaction problems involving rational subsets of direct products of pairs of maximal subgroups of \mathsf{IG}(\mathcal{E}). As an application, we obtain decidability of the word problem for an important class of examples. Also, we prove that for finite \mathcal{E}, \mathsf{IG}(\mathcal{E}) is always a weakly abundant semigroup satisfying the congruence condition.
