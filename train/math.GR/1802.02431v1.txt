Sets of solutions to finite systems of equations in a free group, are equivalent to sets of homomorphisms from a fixed f.p. group into a free group. The latter can be encoded in a diagram, the construction of which is valid also for f.g. groups. The diagram is known to be canonical for a fixed f.g. group with a fixed generating set. In this paper we prove that the construction depends on the chosen generating set of the given f.g. group.
