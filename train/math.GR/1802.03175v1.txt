Let G be a simple algebraic group over an algebraically closed field k, where \mathrm{char}\, k is either 0 or a good prime for G. We consider the modality \mathrm{mod}(B : \mathfrak u) of the action of a Borel subgroup B of G on the Lie algebra \mathfrak u of the unipotent radical of B, and report on computer calculations used to show that \mathrm{mod}(B:\mathfrak u) = 20, when G is of type \mathrm E_8. This completes the determination of the values for \mathrm{mod}(B:\mathfrak u) for G of exceptional type.
