Based on a general theory of descendant trees of finite p-groups and the virtual periodicity isomorphisms between the branches of a coclass subtree, the behavior of algebraic invariants of the tree vertices and their automorphism groups under these isomorphisms is described with simple transformation laws. For the tree of finite 3-groups with elementary bicyclic commutator quotient, the information content of each coclass subtree with metabelian mainline is shown to be finite. As a striking novelty in this paper, evidence is provided of co-periodicity isomorphisms between coclass forests which reduce the information content of the entire metabelian skeleton and a significant part of non-metabelian vertices to a finite amount of data.
