We solve a fundamental question posed in Frohardt's 1988 paper [Fro] on finite 2-groups with Kantor familes, by showing that finite groups with a Kantor family (\mathcal{F},\mathcal{F}^*) having distinct members A, B \in \mathcal{F} such that A^* \cap B^* is a central subgroup of H and the quotient H/(A^* \cap B^*) is abelian cannot exist if the center of H has exponent 4 and the members of \mathcal{F} are elementary abelian. In a similar way, we solve another old problem dating back to the 1970s by showing that finite skew translation quadrangles of even order (t,t) are always translation generalized quadrangles.
