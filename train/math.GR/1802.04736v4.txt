We study lattice embeddings for the class of countable groups \Gamma defined by the property that the largest amenable uniformly recurrent subgroup A_\Gamma is continuous. When A_\Gamma comes from an extremely proximal action and the envelope of A_\Gamma is co-amenable in \Gamma, we obtain restrictions on the locally compact groups G that contain a copy of \Gamma as a lattice, notably regarding normal subgroups of G, product decompositions of G, and more generally dense mappings from G to a product of locally compact groups.
