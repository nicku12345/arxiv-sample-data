We prove that if G is a group of finite Morley rank which acts definably and generically sharply n-transitively on a connected abelian group V of Morley rank n with no involutions, then there is an algebraically closed field F of characteristic \ne 2 such that V has a structure of a vector space of dimension n over F and G acts on V as the group \operatorname{GL}_n(F) in its natural action on F^n.

The manuscript will undergo copyediting, typesetting, and review of the resulting proof before it is published
