We prove that given a finite rank free group \mathbb{F} of rank \geq 3 and two exponentially growing outer automorphisms \psi and \phi with dual lamination pairs \Lambda^\pm_\psi and \Lambda^\pm_\phi associated to them, and given a free factor system \mathcal{F} with co-edge number \geq 2, \phi, \psi  each preserving \mathcal{F}, so that the pair (\phi, \Lambda^\pm_\phi), (\psi, \Lambda^\pm_\psi) is independent relative to \mathcal{F}, then there \exists M\geq 1, such that for any integer m,n \geq M, the group \langle \phi^m, \psi^n \rangle is a free group of rank 2, all of whose non-trivial elements except perhaps the powers of \phi, \psi and their conjugates, are fully irreducible relative to \mathcal{F} with a lamination pair which fills relative to \mathcal{F}.   In addition if both \Lambda^\pm_\phi, \Lambda^\pm_\psi are non-geometric then this lamination pair is also non-geometric.   We also prove that the extension groups induced by such subgroups will be relatively hyperbolic under some natural conditions.
