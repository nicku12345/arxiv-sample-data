We show that the minimal base size b(G) of a finite primitive permutation group G of degree n is at most 2 (\log |G|/\log n) + 24. This bound is asymptotically best possible since there exists a sequence of primitive permutation groups G of degrees n such that b(G) = \lfloor 2 (\log |G|/\log n) \rceil - 2 and b(G) is unbounded. As a corollary we show that a primitive permutation group of degree n that does not contain the alternating group \mathrm{Alt}(n) has a base of size at most \max\{\sqrt{n} , \ 25\}.
