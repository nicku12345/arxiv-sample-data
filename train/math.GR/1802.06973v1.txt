Let V be a vector space of dimension d over F_q, a finite field of q elements, and let G \le GL(V) \cong GL_d(q) be a linear group. A base of G is a set of vectors whose pointwise stabiliser in G is trivial. We prove that if G is a quasisimple group (i.e. G is perfect and G/Z(G) is simple) acting irreducibly on V, then excluding two natural families, G has a base of size at most 6. The two families consist of alternating groups {\rm Alt}_m acting on the natural module of dimension d = m-1 or m-2, and classical groups with natural module of dimension d over subfields of F_q.
