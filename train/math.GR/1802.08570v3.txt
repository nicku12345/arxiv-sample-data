Given a finite rank free group \mathbb{F} of \mathsf{rank}(\mathbb{F})\geq 3, we show that the mapping torus of \phi is (strongly) relatively hyperbolic if \phi is exponentially growing. We combine our result with the work of Button-Kropholler to answer a question asked by Minasyan-Osin regarding the acylindrical hyperbolicity of such free-by-cyclic extensions. As an application we construct new examples of free-by-free hyperbolic extensions where the elements of the quotient group are not necessarily fully irreducible. We also give a new proof of the Bridson-Groves quadratic isoperimetric inequality theorem.
