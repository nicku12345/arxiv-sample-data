For a residually finite group G, its normal subgroups G\supset G_1\supset G_2\cdots with \cap_{n\in\mathbb N}G_n=\{e\} and for a growth function \gamma we construct a unitary representation \pi_\gamma of G. For the minimal growth, \pi_\gamma is weakly equivalent to the regular representation, and for the maximal growth it is weakly equivalent to the direct sum of the quasiregular representations on the quotients G/G_n. In the case of intermediate growth we show two examples of different behaviour of \pi_\gamma.
