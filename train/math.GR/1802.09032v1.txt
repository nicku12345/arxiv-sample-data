Let \Gamma be the first Grigorchuk group. According to a result of Bartholdi, the only left Engel elements of \Gamma are the involutions. This implies that the set of left Engel elements of \Gamma is not a subgroup. Of particular interest is to wonder whether this happens also for the sets of bounded left Engel elements, right Engel elements, and bounded right Engel elements of \Gamma. Motivated by this, we prove that these three subsets of \Gamma coincide with the identity subgroup.
