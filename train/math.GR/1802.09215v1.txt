We study the nonabelian composition factors of a finite group G assumed to admit an \operatorname{Aut}(G)-orbit of length at least \rho|G|, for a given \rho\in\left(0,1\right]. Our main results are the following: The orders of the nonabelian composition factors of G are then bounded in terms of \rho, and if \rho>\frac{18}{19}, then G is solvable. On the other hand, for each nonabelian finite simple group S, there is a constant c(S)\in\left(0,1\right] such that S occurs with arbitrarily large multiplicity as a composition factor in some finite group G having an \operatorname{Aut}(G)-orbit of length at least c(S)|G|.
