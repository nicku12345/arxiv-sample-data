Let w\in\mathbf F_k be a non-trivial word and denote by w(G)\subseteq G the image of the associated word map w\colon G^k\to G. Let G be one of the finite groups {\rm S}_n,{\rm GL}_n(q),{\rm Sp}_{2m}(q),{\rm GO}_{2m}^\pm(q),{\rm GO}_{2m+1}(q),{\rm GU}_n(q) (q a prime power, n\geq 2, m\geq 1), or the unitary group {\rm U}_n over \mathbb C. Let d_G be the normalized Hamming distance resp. the normalized rank metric on G when G is a symmetric group resp. one of the other classical groups and write n(G) for the permutation resp. Lie rank of G. For \varepsilon>0, we prove that there exists an integer N(\varepsilon,w) such that w(G) is \varepsilon-dense in G with respect to the metric d_G if n(G)\geq N(\varepsilon,w). This confirms metric versions of a conjectures by Shalev and Larsen. Equivalently, we prove that any non-trivial word map is surjective on a metric ultraproduct of groups G from above such that n(G)\to\infty along the ultrafilter. As a consequence of our methods, we also obtain an alternative proof of the result of Hui-Larsen-Shalev that w_1({\rm SU}_n)w_2({\rm SU}_n)={\rm SU}_n for non-trivial words w_1,w_2\in\mathbf F_k and n sufficiently large.
