The generating graph of a finite group is a structure which can be used to encode certain information about the group. It was introduced by Liebeck and Shalev and has been further investigated by Lucchini, Mar\'oti, Roney-Dougal and others. We investigate maximal cocliques (totally disconnected induced subgraphs of the generating graph) in \operatorname{PSL}_2(q) for q a prime power and provide a classification of the `large' cocliques when q is prime. We then provide an interesting geometric example which contradicts this result when q is not prime and illustrate why the methods used for the prime case do not immediately extend to the prime-power case with the same result.
