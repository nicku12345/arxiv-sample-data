An indecomposable decomposition of a torsion-free abelian group G of rank n is a decomposition G=A_1\oplus\cdots\oplus A_t where A_i is indecomposable of rank r_i so that \sum_i r_i=n is a partition of n. The group G may have decompositions that result in different partitions of n. We address the problem of characterising those sets of partitions of n which can arise from indecomposable decompositions of a torsion-free abelian group.
