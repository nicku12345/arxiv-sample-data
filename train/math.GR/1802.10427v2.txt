A subset S of a group G invariably generates G if G is generated by \{ s^g(s) | s\in S\}  for any choice of g(s)\in G, s\in S. In case G is topological one defines similarly the notion of topological invariable generation. A topological group G is said to be \mathcal{TIG} if it is topologically invariably generated by some subset S\subseteq G.   In this paper we study the problem of (topological) invariable generation for linear groups and for automorphism groups of trees.   Our main results show that the Lie group \mathrm{SL}_{2}(\mathbb{R}) and the automorphism group of a regular tree are \mathcal{TIG}, and that the groups PSL_m(K) ,m\geq 2 are not \mathcal{IG} for certain countable fields of infinite transcendence degree over the prime field.
