Fix a parameter K\geqslant 1. A K-approximate subgroup is a finite set A in a group G which contains the identity, is symmetric and such that A.A can covered by K left translates of A. This article deals with the generalisation of the concept of approximate groups in the case of loops which we call approximate loops and the description of K-approximate subloops when the ambient loop is a finitely generated commutative moufang loop. Specifically we have a Freiman type theorem where such approximate subloops are controlled by arithmetic progressions defined in the commutative moufang loops.
