The main goal of this note is to suggest an algebraic approach to the quasi-isometric classification of partially commutative groups (alias right-angled Artin groups). More precisely, we conjecture that if the partially commutative groups \mathbb{G}(\Delta) and \mathbb{G}(\Gamma) are quasi-isometric, then \mathbb{G}(\Delta) is a (nice) subgroup of \mathbb{G}(\Gamma) and vice-versa. We show that the conjecture holds for all known cases of quasi-isometric classification of partially commutative groups, namely for the classes of n-tress and atomic graphs.   As in the classical Mostow rigidity theory for irreducible lattices, we relate the quasi-isometric rigidity of the class of atomic partially commutative groups with the algebraic rigidity, that is with the co-Hopfian property of their \mathbb{Q}-completions.
