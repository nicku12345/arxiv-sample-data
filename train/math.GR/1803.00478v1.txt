In this note we introduce pro-Hall R-groups as inverse limits of Hall R-groups and show that for the binomial closure S^{bin} of any ring S discriminated by \mathbb{Z}_p, the free pro-Hall S^{bin}-group \mathbb{F}(A,S^{bin}) is fully residually free pro-p. Furthermore, we prove that any finite set of elements in \mathbb{F}(A,S^{bin}) defines a pro-p subgroup and so an irreducible coordinate group over the free pro-p group.
