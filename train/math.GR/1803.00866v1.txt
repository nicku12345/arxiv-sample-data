Brown has defined the generalised Thompson's group F_n, T_n, where n is an integer at least 2 and Thompson's groups F= F_2 and T =T_2 in the 80's. Burillo, Cleary and Stein have found that there is a quasi-isometric embedding from F_n to F_m where n and m are positive integers at least 2. We show that there is a quasi-isometric embedding from T_n to T_2 for any n \geq 2 and no embeddings from T_2 to T_n for n \geq 3.
