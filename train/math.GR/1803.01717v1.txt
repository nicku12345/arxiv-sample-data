In this paper, we study the structures of finite groups using some arithmetic conditions on the sizes of real conjugacy classes. We prove that a finite group is solvable if the prime graph on the real class sizes of the group is disconnected. Moreover, we show that if the sizes of all non-central real conjugacy classes of a finite group G have the same 2-part and the Sylow 2-subgroup of G satisfies certain condition, then G is solvable.
