Let n and k be integers with n>2k, k\geq1. We denote by H(n, k) the bipartite\ Kneser\ graph, that is, a graph with the family of k-subsets and (n-k)-subsets of [n] = \{1, 2, ... , n\} as vertices, in which   any two vertices are adjacent if and only if one of them is a subset of the other. In this paper, we determine the automorphism group of H(n, k). We show that Aut(H(n, k))\cong Sym([n]) \times \mathbb{Z}_2 where \mathbb{Z}_2 is the cyclic group of order 2. Then, as an application of the obtained result, we give a new proof for determining the automorphism group of the Kneser graph K(n,k). In fact we show how to determine the automorphism group of the Kneser graph K(n,k) given the automorphism group of the Johnson graph J(n,k). Note that the known proofs for determining the automorphism groups of Johnson graph J(n,k) and Kneser graph  K(n,k) are independent from each other.
