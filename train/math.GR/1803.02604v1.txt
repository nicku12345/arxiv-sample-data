Let [n]=\{1,2,\ldots,n\} be a finite chain and let \mathcal{P}_{n} be the semigroup of partial transformations on [n]. Let \mathcal{CP}_{n}=\{\alpha\in \mathcal{P}_{n}: (for ~all~x,y\in Dom~\alpha)~|x\alpha-y\alpha|\leq|x-y|\} be the subsemigroup of partial contraction mappings on [n]. We have shown that the semigroup \mathcal{CP}_{n} and some of its subsemigroups are nonregular left abundant semigroups for all n but not right abundant for n\geq 4.
