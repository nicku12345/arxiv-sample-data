Let G be a finite group. It was remarked by Breuillard-Green-Guralnick-Tao that if the Cayley graph C(G,S) is an expander graph and is non-bipartite then the spectrum of the adjacency operator T is bounded away from -1. In this article we are interested in explicit bounds for the spectrum of these graphs. Specifically, we show that the non-trivial spectrum of the adjacency operator lies in the interval \left[-1+\frac{h(\mathbb{G})^{4}}{\gamma}, 1-\frac{h(\mathbb{G})^{2}}{2d^{2}}\right], where h(\mathbb{G}) denotes the (vertex) Cheeger constant of the d regular graph C(G,S) with respect to a symmetric set S of generators and \gamma = 2^{9}d^{6}(d+1)^{2}.
