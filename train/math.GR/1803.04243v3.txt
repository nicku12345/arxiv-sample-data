In this study we introduce \alpha-elasticity property for generalized Moufang loops. Necessary and sufficient conditions for \alpha-elasticity of generalized Moufang loops to be universal are given. Using the universal conditions, and in some cases, with the newly introduced right and left \alpha-alternative laws for generalized Moufang loops, some properties of generalized Moufang loops are studied. Condition under which the generalized Moufang loop is an abelian group is stated.
