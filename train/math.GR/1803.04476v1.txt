A mapping from a semigroup S to the unit interval [0, 1] is called a fuzzy set of S. It is known that the set {\cal F}(S) of all fuzzy sets of a semigroup S is a semigroup under the operation \circ defined by \[(f\circ g)(s)=\begin{cases} \vee _{s=xy}(f(x)\wedge g(y)), & \text{if s\in S^2}\\ 0, & \text{otherwise.}\end{cases}\] For every element a of a semigroup S, we define an operation \star on the set {\cal F}^*(D_a) of all fuzzy sets of the set D_a of all divisors of a in S, and show that this operation is associative. The main result of this paper is that, for every semigroup S, the semigroup ({\cal F}(S); \circ ) is a subdirect product of the semigroups ({\cal F}^*(D_a); \star ), \ a\in S.
