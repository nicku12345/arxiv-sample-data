If G is a Grigorchuk-Gupta-Sidki group defined over a p-adic tree, where p is an odd prime, we study the existence of Beauville surfaces associated to the quotients of G by its level stabilizers \st_G(n). We prove that if G is periodic then the quotients G/\st_G(n) are Beauville groups for every n\geq 2 if p\geq 5 and n\geq 3 if p=3. On the other hand, if G is non-periodic, then none of the quotients G/\st_G(n) are Beauville groups.
