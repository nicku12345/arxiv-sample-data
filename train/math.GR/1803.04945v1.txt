We define a tower of injections of \tilde{B}-type (resp. \tilde{D}-type) Coxeter groups W(\tilde B_{n}) (resp. W(\tilde D_{n})) for n\geq 3. Let W^c(\tilde B_{n}) (resp. W^c(\tilde D_{n})) be the set of fully commutative elements in W(\tilde B_{n}) (resp. W(\tilde D_{n})), we classify the elements of this set by giving a normal form for them. We define a \tilde{B}-type tower of Hecke algebras and we use the faithfulness at the Coxeter level to show that this last tower is a tower of injections.   We use this normal form to define two injections from W^c(\tilde B_{n-1}) into W^c(\tilde B_{n}). We then define the tower of affine Temperley-Lieb algebras of type \tilde{B } and use the injections above to prove the faithfulness of this tower. We follow the same track for \tilde{D}-type objects
