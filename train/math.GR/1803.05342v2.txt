H.J. Zassenhaus conjectured that any unit of finite order and augmentation 1 in the integral group ring \mathbb{Z}G of a finite group G is conjugate in the rational group algebra \mathbb{Q}G to an element of G. We prove the Zassenhaus Conjecture for the groups \text{SL}(2,p) and \text{SL}(2,p^2) with p a prime number. This is the first infinite family of non-solvable groups for which the Zassenhaus Conjecture has been proved. We also prove that if G=\text{SL}(2,p^f), with f arbitrary and u is a torsion unit of \mathbb{Z}G with augmentation 1 and order coprime with p then u is conjugate in \mathbb{Q}G to an element of G. By known results, this reduces the proof of the Zassenhaus Conjecture for this groups to prove that every unit of \mathbb{Z}G of order multiple of p and augmentation 1 has actually order p.
