We recast the notion of joint spectral radius in the setting of groups acting by isometries on non-positively curved spaces and give geometric versions of results of Berger-Wang and Bochi valid for \delta-hyperbolic spaces and for symmetric spaces of non-compact type. This method produces nice hyperbolic elements in many classical geometric settings. Applications to uniform growth are given, in particular a new proof and a generalization of a theorem of Besson-Courtois-Gallot.
