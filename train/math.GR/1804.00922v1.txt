The {\it prime graph} \Gamma(G) of a finite group G is the graph whose vertex set is the set of prime divisors of |G| and in which two distinct vertices r and s are adjacent if and only if there exists an element of G of order rs. Let A_n (S_n) denote the alternating (symmetric) group of degree n. We prove that if G is a finite group with \Gamma(G)=\Gamma(A_n) or \Gamma(G)=\Gamma(S_n), where n\geq19, then there exists a normal subgroup K of G and an integer t such that A_t\leq G/K\leq S_t and |K| is divisible by at most one prime greater than n/2.
