Given nontrivial finite groups A and B, not both of order 2, we prove that every finite simple group of sufficiently large rank is an image of the free product A \ast B. To show this, we prove that every finite simple group of sufficiently large rank is generated by a pair of subgroups isomorphic to A and B. This proves a conjecture of Tamburini and Wilson.
