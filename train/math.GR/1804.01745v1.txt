In this short note we confirm a conjecture of James Wiegold. We prove that if G is a finite p-group and |G'|>p^{n(n-1)/2} for some non-negative integer n, then the group G can be generated by the elements of breadth at least n. The breadth b(x) of an element x of a finite p-group G is defined by the equation |G:C_G(x)| = p^{b(x)}, where C_G(x) is the centralizer of x in G.
