We establish quasi-isometric rigidity for a class of right-angled Coxeter groups. Let \Gamma_1,\Gamma_2 be joins of finite generalized thick m-gons with m\geq 3. We show that the corresponding right-angled Coxeter groups are quasi-isometric if and only if \Gamma_1,\Gamma_2 are isomorphic. We also give a construction of commensurable right-angled Coxeter groups.
