Let n and k be integers with n> k\geq1 and [n] = \{1, 2, ... , n\} . The bipartite \ Kneser \ graph H(n, k) is the graph with the all k-element and all (n-k)-element subsets of [n]  as vertices, and there is an edge between any two vertices, when one is a subset of the other. In this paper, we show that H(n, k) is an arc-transitive graph. Also, we show that H(n,1) is a distance-transitive Cayley graph. Finally, we determine the automorphism group of the graph H(n, 1) and show that Aut(H(n, 1)) \cong Sym([n] ) \times \mathbb{Z}_2, where \mathbb{Z}_2 is the cyclic group of order 2. Moreover, we pose some open problems about the automorphism group of the bipartite Kneser graph H(n, k).
