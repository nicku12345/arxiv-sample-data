Throughout this paper, all groups are finite. Let \sigma =\{\sigma_{i} | i\in I \} be some partition of the set of all primes \Bbb{P}. If   n is an integer, the symbol \sigma (n) denotes   the set \{\sigma_{i} |\sigma_{i}\cap \pi (n)\ne   \emptyset \}. The integers n and m are called \sigma-coprime if \sigma (n)\cap \sigma (m)=\emptyset.   Let t > 1 be a natural number and let \mathfrak{F} be a class of groups. Then we say that \mathfrak{F} is \Sigma_{t}^{\sigma}-closed provided \mathfrak{F} contains each group   G with subgroups A_{1}, \ldots , A_{t}\in   \mathfrak{F} whose indices |G:A_{1}|, \ldots, |G:A_{t}| are pairwise \sigma-coprime.   In this paper, we study \Sigma_{t}^{\sigma}-closed classes of finite groups.
