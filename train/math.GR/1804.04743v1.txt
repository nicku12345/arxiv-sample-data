There are two major structure theorems for an arbitrary regular semigroup using categories, both due to Nambooripad. The first construction using inductive groupoids departs from the biordered set structure of a given regular semigroup. This approach belongs to the realm of the celebrated Ehresmann--Schein--Nambooripad Theorem and its subsequent generalisations. The second construction is a generalisation of Grillet's work on cross-connected partially ordered sets, arising from the principal ideals of the given semigroup. In this article, we establish a direct equivalence between these two seemingly different constructions. We show how the cross-connection representation of a regular semigroup may be constructed directly from the inductive groupoid of the semigroup, and vice versa.
