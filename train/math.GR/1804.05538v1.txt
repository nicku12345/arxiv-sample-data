We show that certain algebraic structures lack freeness in the absence of the axiom of choice. These include some subgroups of the Baer-Specker group \mathbb{Z}^{\omega} and the Hawaiian earring group. Applications to slenderness, completely metrizable topological groups, length functions and strongly bounded groups are also presented
