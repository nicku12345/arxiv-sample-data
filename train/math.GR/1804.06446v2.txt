We establish the existence of two rigid triples of conjugacy classes in the algebraic group G_{2} in characteristic 5, complementing results of the second author with Liebeck and Marion. As a corollary, the finite groups G_{2}(5^n) are not (2,4,5)-generated, confirming a conjecture of Marion in this case.
