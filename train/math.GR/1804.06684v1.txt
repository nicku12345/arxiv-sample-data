Let G be a finite group and S< G. A cover for a group G is a collection of subgroups of G whose union is G. We use the term n-cover for a cover with n members. A cover \Pi =\{H_1, H_2, \dots, H_n\} is said to be a strict \mathit{S}-partition of G if H_i\cap H_j= S for i\neq j and \Pi is said an equal strict \mathit{S}-partition (or ES-partition ) of G, if \Pi is a strict S-partition and |H_i|=|H_j| for all i\neq j. If S is the identity subgroup and G has a strict S-partition (equal strict \mathit{S}-partition), then we say that G has a partition (equally partition, resp.).
