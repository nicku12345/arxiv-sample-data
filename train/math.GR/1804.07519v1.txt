Let \Gamma be a Coxeter graph, let W be its associated Coxeter group, and let G be a group of symmetries of \Gamma.Recall that, by a theorem of H{\'e}e and M\"uhlherr, W^G is a Coxeter group associated to some Coxeter graph \hat \Gamma.We denote by \Phi^+ the set of positive roots of \Gamma and by \hat \Phi^+ the set of positive roots of \hat \Gamma.Let E be a vector space over a field \K having a basis in one-to-one correspondence with \Phi^+.The action of G on \Gamma induces an action of G on \Phi^+, and therefore on E.We show that E^G contains a linearly independent family of vectors naturally in one-to-one correspondence with \hat \Phi^+ and we determine exactly when this family is a basis of E^G.This question is motivated by the construction of Krammer's style linear representations for non simply laced Artin groups.
