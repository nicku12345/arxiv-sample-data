Let G be a finite group, p a prime, and IBr_p(G) the set of irreducible p-Brauer characters of G. Let \bar e_p(G) be the largest integer such that p^{\bar e_p(G)} divides \chi(1) for some \chi \in IBr_p(G). We show that |G:O_p(G)|_p \leq p^{k \bar e_p(G)} for an explicitly given constant k. We also study the analogous problem for the p-parts of the conjugacy class sizes of p-regular elements of finite groups.
