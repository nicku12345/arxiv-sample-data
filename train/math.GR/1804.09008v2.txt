We show how all topological full groups coming from a one-sided irreducible shift of finite type, as studied by Matui, can be re-interpreted as groups of colour-preserving tree almost automorphisms. As an application, we show that they admit t.d.l.c. completions of arbitrary finite local prime content. This applies in particular to Thompson's V.
