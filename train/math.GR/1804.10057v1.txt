Let [n]=\{1,2,\ldots,n\} be a finite chain and let \mathcal{T}_{n} be the semigroup of full transformations on [n]. Let \mathcal{CT}_{n}=\{\alpha\in \mathcal{T}_{n}: (for ~all~x,y\in [n])~\left|x\alpha-y\alpha\right|\leq\left|x-y\right|\}, then \mathcal{CT}_{n} is a subsemigroup of \mathcal{T}_{n}. In this paper, we give a necessary and sufficient condition for an element to be regular and characterize all the Green's equivalences for the semigroup \mathcal{CT}_{n}. We further show that the semigroup \mathcal{CT}_{n} is a left abundant semigroup.
