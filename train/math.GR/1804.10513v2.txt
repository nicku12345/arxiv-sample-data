We investigate the structure of finite groups whose non-central real class sizes have the same 2-part. In particular, we prove that such groups are solvable and have 2-length one. As a consequence, we show that a finite group is solvable if it has two real class sizes. This confirms a conjecture due to G. Navarro, L. Sanus and P. Tiep.
