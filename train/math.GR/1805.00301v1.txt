Let G be a finite group, L_1(G) be its poset of cyclic subgroups and consider the quantity \alpha(G)=\frac{|L_1(G)|}{|G|}. The aim of this paper is to study the class \cal{C} of finite nilpotent groups having \alpha(G)=\frac{3}{4}. We show that if G belongs to this class, then it is a 2-group satisfying certain conditions. Also, we study the appartenance of some classes of finite groups to \cal{C}.
