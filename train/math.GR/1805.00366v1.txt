We study the \mathrm{Out}(F_n)-action on the second bounded cohomology H^2_b(F_n, \mathbb{R}), focusing on the countable-dimensional dense invariant subspace given by Brooks quasimorphisms. We show that this subspace has no finite-dimensional invariant subspaces, in particular no fixpoints, partially answering a question of Mikl\'{o}s Ab\'{e}rt. To this end we introduce a notion of speed of an element g\in \mathrm{Out}(F_n), which measures the asymptotic growth rate of bounded cohomology classes under repeated application of g.
