The supremum of lengths of strict chains of nested centralizers is called the c-dimension (centralizer dimension) of G. We prove two structure theorems for locally finite groups of finite c-dimension. We also prove that the c-dimension of the quotient of such a group by a locally soluble radical is bounded in terms of the c-dimension of the group itself.
