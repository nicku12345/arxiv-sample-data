While finite type Artin groups and right-angled Artin groups are well-understood, little is known about more general Artin groups. In this paper we use the action of an infinite type Artin group A_\Gamma on a CAT(0) cube complex to prove that A_\Gamma has trivial center providing the graph \Gamma is not the star of a single vertex, and is acylindrically hyperbolic providing \Gamma is not a join.
