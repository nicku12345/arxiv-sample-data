We show that Gromov's monsters arising from i.i.d. random labellings of expanders (that we call random Gromov's monsters) have linear divergence along a subsequence, so that in particular they do not contain Morse quasigeodesics, and they are not quasi-isometric to Gromov's monsters arising from graphical small cancellation labellings of expanders. Moreover, by further studying the divergence function, we show that there are uncountably many quasi-isometry classes of random Gromov's monsters.
