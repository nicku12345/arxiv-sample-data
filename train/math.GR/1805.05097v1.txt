Let \sigma=\{\sigma_{i}|i\in I\} be some partition of the set \mathbb{P} of all primes, that is, \mathbb{P}=\bigcup_{i\in I}\sigma_{i} and \sigma_{i}\cap \sigma_{j}=\emptyset for all i\neq j. Let G be a finite group. A set \mathcal {H} of subgroups of G is said to be a complete Hall \sigma-set of G if every non-identity member of \mathcal {H} is a Hall \sigma_{i}-subgroup of G and \mathcal {H} contains exactly one Hall \sigma_{i}-subgroup of G for every \sigma_{i}\in \sigma(G). G is said to be a \sigma-group if it possesses a complete Hall \sigma-set. A \sigma-group G is said to be \sigma-dispersive provided G has a normal series 1 = G_1<G_2<\cdots< G_t< G_{t+1} = G and a complete Hall \sigma-set \{H_{1}, H_{2}, \cdots, H_{t}\} such that G_iH_i = G_{i+1} for all i= 1,2,\ldots t. In this paper, we give a characterizations of \sigma-dispersive group, which give a positive answer to an open problem of Skiba in the paper.
