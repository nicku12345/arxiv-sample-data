Let R be an integral domain of zero characteristic. In this note we study the Reidemeister spectrum of the group {\rm UT}_n(R) of unitriangular matrices over R. We prove that if R^+ is finitely generated and n>2|R^*|, then {\rm UT}_n(R) possesses the R_{\infty}-property, i. e. the Reidemeister spectrum of {\rm UT}_n(R) contains only \infty, however, if n\leq|R^*|, then the Reidemeister spectrum of {\rm UT}_n(R) has nonempty intersection with \mathbb{N}. If R is a field, then we prove that the Reidemeister spectrum of {\rm UT}_n(R) coincides with \{1,\infty\}, i. e. in this case {\rm UT}_n(R) does not possess the R_{\infty}-property.
