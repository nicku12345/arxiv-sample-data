We study fixed point properties of the automorphism group of the universal Coxeter group Aut(W_n). In particular, we prove that whenever Aut(W_n) acts by isometries on complete d-dimensional CAT(0) space with d<\lfloor\frac{n}{2}\rfloor, then it must fix a point. We also prove that Aut(W_n) does not have Kazhdan's property (T). Further, strong restrictions are obtained on homomorphisms of Aut(W_n) to groups that do not contain a copy of Sym(n).
