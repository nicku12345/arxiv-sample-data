We describe solutions of the equation x^ny^m=a^nb^m in acylindrically hyperbolic groups (AH-groups), where a,b are non-commensurable special loxodromic elements and n,m are integers with sufficiently large common divisor. Using this description and certain test words in AH-groups, we study the verbal closedness of AH-subgroups in groups. A subgroup H of a group G is called verbally closed if for any word w(x_1,\dots, x_n) in variables x_1,\dots,x_n and any element h\in H, the equation w(x_1,\dots, x_n)=h has a solution in G if and only if it has a solution in H. Main Theorem: Suppose that G is a finitely presented group and H is a finitely generated acylindrically hyperbolic subgroup of G such that H does not have nontrivial finite normal subgroups. Then H is verbally closed in G if and only if H is a retract of G. The condition that G is finitely presented and H is finitely generated can be replaced by the condition that G is finitely generated over H and H is equationally Noetherian. As a corollary, we solve Problem 5.2 from the paper arXiv:1201.0497v2 of Miasnikov and Roman'kov: Verbally closed subgroups of torsion-free hyperbolic groups are retracts.
