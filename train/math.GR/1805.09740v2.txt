We consider a natural generalization of braids which we call shrinking braids. We state the relations of shrinking braids and use them to define algebraically the monoid R. We endow a subset of R with a \emph{left distributive monoid} structure and use it to extend the Dehornoy order on B_{\infty} to an order on R. By using this order, we prove that R is isomorphic to the monoid which is generated (geometrically) by shrinking braids.
