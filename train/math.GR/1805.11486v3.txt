In this paper we discuss the problem of existence of so called weak Sierpi\'nski sets in groups. It is known that group G has a Sierpi\'nski subset if and only if it contains a free subgroup. In their paper, Tomkowicz and Wagon conjectured that an analogous result holds also for the weaker condition. We derive a number of properties of groups with weak Sierpi\'nski subsets and use them to prove the above mentioned conjecture.   This is an improved version of arXiv:1805.11486. Some of the included proofs have been simplified and shortened.
