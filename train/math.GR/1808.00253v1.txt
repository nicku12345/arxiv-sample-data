Let G be a finite group and \psi(G) = \sum_{g \in G} o(g), where o(g) denotes the order of g \in G. In [M. Herzog, et. al., Two new criteria for solvability of finite groups, J. Algebra, 2018], the authors put forward the following conjecture: \textbf{Conjecture.} \textit{If G is a group of order n and \psi(G)>211\psi(C_n)/1617 , where C_n is the cyclic group of order n, then G is solvable.} In this paper we prove the validity of this conjecture.
