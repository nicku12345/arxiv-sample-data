We prove that groups for which every countable subgroup is free (\aleph_1-free groups) are n-slender, cm-slender, and lcH-slender. In particular every homomorphism from a completely metrizable group to an \aleph_1-free group has an open kernel. We also show that \aleph_1-free abelian groups are lcH-slender, which is especially interesting in light of the fact that some \aleph_1-free abelian groups are neither n- nor cm-slender. The strongly \aleph_1-free abelian groups are shown to be n-, cm-, and lcH-slender. We also give a characterization of cm- and lcH-slender abelian groups.
