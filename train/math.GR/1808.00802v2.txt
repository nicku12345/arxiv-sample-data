Let H be a hyperbolic group, A and B be subgroups of H, and gr(H,A,B) be the growth function of the double cosets AhB, h \in H. We prove that the behavior of gr(H,A,B) splits into two different cases. If A and B are not quasiconvex, we obtain that every growth function of a finitely presented group can appear as gr(H,A,B). We can even take A=B. In contrast, for quasiconvex subgroups A and B of infinite index, gr(H,A,B) is exponential. Moreover, there exists a constant \lambda > 0, such that gr(H,A,B)(r) >\lambda f_H(r) for all big enough r, where f_H(r) is the growth function of the group H. So, we have a clear dychotomy between the quasiconvex and non-quasiconvex case.
