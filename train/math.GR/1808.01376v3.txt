In this paper, we introduce the notions of matching matrices in groups and vector spaces, which lead to some necessary conditions for existence of acyclic matching in abelian groups and its linear analogue. We also study the linear local matching property in field extensions to find a dimension criteria for linear locally matchable bases. Moreover, we define the weakly locally matchable subspaces and we investigate their relations with matchable subspaces. We provide an upper bound for the dimension of primitive subspaces in a separable field extension. We employ MATLAB coding to investigate the existence of acyclic matchings in finite cyclic groups. Finally, a possible research problem on matchings in n-groups is presented. Our tools in this paper mix combinatorics and linear algebra.
