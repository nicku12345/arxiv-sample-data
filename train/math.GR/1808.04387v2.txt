Let G be a finite group. A family \mathcal{M} of maximal subgroups of G is called `irredundant' if its intersection is not equal to the intersection of any proper subfamily. \mathcal{M} is called `maximal irredundant' if \mathcal{M} is irredundant and it is not properly contained in any other irredundant family. We denote by \mbox{Mindim}(G) the minimal size of a maximal irredundant family of G. In this paper we compute \mbox{Mindim}(G) when G is the alternating group on n letters.
