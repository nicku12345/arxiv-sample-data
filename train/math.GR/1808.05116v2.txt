The probabilistic Waring problem for finite simple groups asks whether every word of the form w_1w_2, where w_1 and w_2 are non-trivial words in disjoint sets of variables, induces almost uniform distribution on finite simple groups with respect to the L^1 norm. Our first main result provides a positive solution to this problem.   We also provide a geometric characterization of words inducing almost uniform distribution on finite simple groups of Lie type of bounded rank, and study related random walks.   Our second main result concerns the probabilistic L^{\infty} Waring problem for finite simple groups. We show that for every l \ge 1 there exists N = N(l), such that if w_1, \ldots , w_N are non-trivial words of length at most l in pairwise disjoint sets of variables, then their product w_1 \cdots w_N is almost uniform on finite simple groups with respect to the L^{\infty} norm. The dependence of N on l is genuine. This result implies that, for every word w = w_1 \cdots w_N as above, the word map induced by w on a semisimple algebraic group over an arbitrary field is a flat morphism.   Applications to representation varieties, subgroup growth, and random generation are also presented.
