The isoperimeric spectrum consists of all real positive numbers \alpha such that O(n^\alpha) is the Dehn function of a finitely presented group. In this note we show how a recent result of Olshanskii completes the description of the isoperimetric spectrum modulo the celebrated Computer Science conjecture (and one of the seven Millennium Problems) \mathbf{P=NP} and even a formally weaker conjecture.
