Let T_1, T_2 be regular trees of degrees d_1, d_2 \geq 3. Let also \Gamma \leq \mathrm{Aut}(T_1) \times \mathrm{Aut}(T_2) be a group acting freely and transitively on VT_1 \times VT_2. For i=1 and 2, assume that the local action of \Gamma on T_i is 2-transitive; if moreover d_i \geq 7, assume that the local action contains \mathrm{Alt}(d_i). We show that \Gamma is irreducible, unless (d_1, d_2) belongs to an explicit small set of exceptional values. This yields an irreducibility criterion for \Gamma that can be checked purely in terms of its local action on a ball of radius 1 in T_1 and T_2. Under the same hypotheses, we show moreover that if \Gamma is irreducible, then it is hereditarily just-infinite, provided the local action on T_i is not the affine group \mathbf F_5 \rtimes \mathbf F_5^*. The proofs rely, in several ways, on the Classification of the Finite Simple Groups.
