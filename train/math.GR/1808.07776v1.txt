Every finite non-nilpotent group can be extended by a term operation such that solving equations in the resulting algebra is NP-complete and checking identities is co-NP-complete. This result was firstly proven by Horv\'ath and Szab\'o; the term constructed in their proof depends on the underlying group. In this paper we provide a uniform term extension that induces hardness. In doing so we also characterize a big class of solvable, non-nilpotent groups for which extending by the commutator operation suffices.
