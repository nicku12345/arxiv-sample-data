Fixing a subgroup \Gamma in a group G, the commensurability growth function assigns to each n the cardinality of the set of subgroups \Delta of G with [\Gamma: \Gamma \cap \Delta][\Delta : \Gamma \cap \Delta] = n. For pairs \Gamma \leq A, where A is the automorphism group of a p-regular tree and \Gamma is finitely generated, we show that this function can take on finite, countable, or uncountable cardinals. For almost all known branch groups \Gamma (the first Grigorchuk group, the twisted twin Grigorchuk group, Pervova groups, Gupta-Sidki groups, etc.) acting on p-regular trees, this function is precisely \aleph_0 for any n = p^k.
