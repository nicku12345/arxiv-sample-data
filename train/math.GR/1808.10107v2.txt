Let \mathfrak{X} be a class of finite groups closed under taking subgroups, homomorphic images and extensions. It is known that if A is a normal subgroup of a finite group G then the image of an \mathfrak{X}-maximal subgroup H of G in G/A is not, in general, \mathfrak{X}-maximal in G/A. We say that the reduction \mathfrak{X}-theorem holds for a finite group A if, for every finite group G that is an extension of A (i. e. contains A as a normal subgroup), the number of conjugacy classes of \mathfrak{X}-maximal subgroups in G and G/A is the same. The reduction \mathfrak{X}-theorem for A implies that HA/A is \mathfrak{X}-maximal in G/A for every extension G of A and every \mathfrak{X}-maximal subgroup H of G. In this paper, we prove that the reduction \mathfrak{X}-theorem holds for A if and only if all \mathfrak{X}-maximal subgroups are conjugate in A and classify the finite groups with this property in terms of composition factors.
