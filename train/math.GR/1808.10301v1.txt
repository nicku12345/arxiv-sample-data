Let VB_n be the virtual braid group on n strands and let \mathfrak{S}_n be the symmetric group on n letters. Let n,m \in \mathbb{N} such that n \ge 5, m \ge 2 and n \ge m. We determine all possible homomorphisms from VB_n to \mathfrak{S}_m, from \mathfrak{S}_n to VB_m and from VB_n to VB_m. As corollaries we get that Out(VB_n) is isomorphic to \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z} and that VB_n is both Hopfian and co-Hofpian.
