We study ascending HNN-extensions G of finitely generated free abelian groups: examples of such G include soluble Baumslag-Solitar groups and fundamental groups of orientable prime 3-manifolds modelled on Sol geometry. In particular, we study the elliptic subgroup A \leq G, consisting of all elements that stabilise a point in the Bass-Serre tree of G. We consider the density of A with respect to ball counting measures corresponding to finite generating sets of G, and we show that A is exponentially negligible in G with respect to such sequences of measures. As a consequence, we show that the set of tuples (x_0,\ldots,x_r) \in G^{r+1}, such that the (r+1)-fold simple commutator [x_0,\ldots,x_r] vanishes, is exponentially negligible in G^{r+1} with respect to sequences of ball counting measures.
