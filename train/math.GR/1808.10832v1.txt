In 1988 Siemons and Wagner describe a relationship between the lengths of G-orbits on subsets of a G-set \Omega. They highlighted the situation where \Delta \subset \Omega with |\Delta|=k, and |\Delta^G|>|\Sigma^G| for all (k+1)-subsets, \Sigma of \Omega where \Delta\subset\Sigma. They went on to classify all primitive groups with this property for k=2. Here we address some questions about primitive permutation groups satisfying this property when k=3 and list all 3-homogeneous groups satisfying this condition.
