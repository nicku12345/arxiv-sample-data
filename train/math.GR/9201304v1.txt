This note presents an elementary version of Sims's algorithm for computing strong generators of a given perm group, together with a proof of correctness and some notes about appropriate low-level data structures. Upper and lower bounds on the running time are also obtained. (Following a suggestion of Vaughan Pratt, we adopt the convention that perm = permutation, perhaps thereby saving millions of syllables in future research.)
