Given a finite simplicial graph {\cal G}, the graph group G{\cal G}" is the group with generators in one-to-one correspondence with the vertices of {\cal G} and with relations stating two generators commute if their associated vertices are adjacent in {\cal G}. The Bieri-Neumann-Strebel invariant can be explicitly described in terms of the original graph {\cal G} and hence there is an explicit description of the distribution of finitely generated normal subgroups of G{\cal G} with abelian quotient. We construct Eilenberg-MacLane spaces for graph groups and find partial extensions of this work to the higher dimensional invariants.
