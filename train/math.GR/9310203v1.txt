A combinatorial group-theoretic hypothesis is presented that serves as a necessary and sufficient condition for a union of connected Cockcroft two-complexes to be Cockcroft. This hypothesis has a component that can be expressed in terms of the second homology of groups. The hypothesis is applied to the study of the third homology of groups given by generators and relators.
