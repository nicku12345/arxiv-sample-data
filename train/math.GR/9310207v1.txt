Let \Gamma be a finite graph together with a group G_v at each vertex v. The graph product G(\Gamma) is obtained from the free product of all G_v by factoring out by the normal subgroup generated by \{g^{-1}h^{-1}gh; g\in G_v, h\in G_w\} for all adjacent v,w. In this note we construct a projective resolution for G(\Gamma) given projective resolutions for each G_v, and obtain some applications.
