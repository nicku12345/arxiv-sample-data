We see that a building whose Coxeter group is hyperbolic is itself hyperbolic. Thus any finitely generated group acting co-compactly on such a building is hyperbolic, hence automatic. We turn our attention to affine buildings and consider a group \Gamma which acts simply transitively and in a ``type-rotating'' way on the vertices of a locally finite thick building of type \tilde A_n. We show that \Gamma is biautomatic, using a presentation of \Gamma and unique normal form for each element of \Gamma, as described in ``Groups acting simply transitively on the vertices of a building of type \tilde A_n'' by D.I.
