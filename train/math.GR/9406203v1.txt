Group theory is a particularly fertile field for the design of practical algorithms. Algorithms have been developed across the various branches of the subject and they find wide application. Because of its relative maturity, computational group theory may be used to gain insight into the general structure of algebraic algorithms. This paper examines the basic ideas behind some of the more important algorithms for finitely presented groups and permutation groups, and surveys recent developments in these fields.
