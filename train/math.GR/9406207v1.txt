Computer based techniques for recognizing finitely presented groups are quite powerful. Tools available for this purpose are outlined. They are available both in stand-alone programs and in more comprehensive systems. A general computational approach for investigating finitely presented groups by way of quotients and subgroups is described and examples are presented. The techniques can provide detailed information about group structure. Under suitable circumstances a finitely presented group can be shown to be soluble and its complete derived series can be determined, using what is in effect a soluble quotient algorithm.
