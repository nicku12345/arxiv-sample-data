We announce the classification of two related classes of flag-transitive geometries. There is an infinite family of such geometries, related to the nonsplit extensions 3^{[{n\atop 2}]_{_2}}\cdot \SP_{2n}(2), and twelve sporadic examples coming from the simple groups M_{22}, M_{23}, M_{24}, He, Co_1, Co_2, J_4, BM, M and the nonsplit extensions 3\cdot M_{22}, 3^{23}\cdot Co_2, and 3^{4371}\cdot BM.
