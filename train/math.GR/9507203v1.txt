For a CSA group G and a wide class of abelian groups A we give an explicit construction for the tensor A-completion of G using free products with amalgamations. We apply the obtained results to the study of basic properties of A-free groups. In particular, canonical and reduced forms of elements in A-free groups are introduced, and then commuting and conjugate elements are described.
