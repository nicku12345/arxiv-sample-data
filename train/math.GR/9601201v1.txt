Let (W,S) be a Coxeter system, and let X be a subset of S. The subgroup of W generated by X is denoted by W_X and is called a parabolic subgroup. We give the precise definition of the commensurator of a subgroup in a group. In particular, the commensurator of W_X in W is the subgroup of w in W such that wW_Xw^{-1}\cap W_X has finite index in both W_X and wW_Xw^{-1}. The subgroup W_X can be decomposed in the form W_X = W_{X^0} \cdot W_{X^\infty} \simeq W_{X^0} \times W_{X^\infty} where W_{X^0} is finite and all the irreducible components of W_{X^\infty}" > are infinite. Let Y^\infty be the set of t in S such that m_{s,t}=2" > for all s\in X^\infty. We prove that the commensurator of W_X is W_{Y^\infty} \cdot W_{X^\infty} \simeq W_{Y^\infty} \times W_{X^\infty}. In particular, the commensurator of a parabolic subgroup is a parabolic subgroup, and W_X is its own commensurator if and only if X^0=Y^\infty.
