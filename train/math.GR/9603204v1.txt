Sacerdote [Sa] has shown that the non-Abelian free groups satisfy precisely the same universal-existential sentences Th(F_2)\cap \forall \exists  in a first-order language L_o appropriate for group theory. It is shown that in every model of Th(F_2)\cap \forall \exists  the maximal Abelian subgroups are elementarily equivalent to locally cyclic groups (necessarily nontrivial and torsion free). Two classes of groups are interpolated between the non-Abelian locally free groups and Remeslennikov's \exists -free groups. These classes are the \textbf{almost locally free groups} and the \textbf{quasi-locally free groups}. In particular, the almost locally free% \textbf{\ }groups are the models of Th(F_2)\cap \forall \exists  while the quasi-locally free groups are the \exists -free groups with maximal Abelian subgroups elemenatarily equivalent to locally cyclic groups (necessarily nontrivial and torsion free). Two principal open questions at opposite ends of a spectrum are: (1.) Is every finitely generated almost locally free group free? (2.) Is every quasi-locally free group almost locally free? Examples abound of finitely generated quasi-locally free groups containing nontrivial torsion in their Abelianizations. The question of whether or not almost locally free groups have torsion free Abelianization is related to a bound in a free group on the number of factors needed to express certain elements of the derived group as a product of commutators.
