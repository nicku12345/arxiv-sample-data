We consider IA-endomorphisms (i.e., Identical in Abelianization) of a free metabelian group of finite rank, and give a matrix characterization of their fixed points which is similar to (yet different from) the well-known characterization of eigenvectors of a linear operator in a vector space. We then use our matrix characterization to elaborate several properties of the fixed point groups of metabelian endomorphisms. In particular, we show that the rank of the fixed point group of an IA-endomorphism of the free metabelian group of rank n \ge 2 can be either equal to 0, 1, or greater than (n-1) (in particular, it can be infinite). We also point out a connection between these properties of metabelian IA-endomorphisms and some properties of the Gassner representation of pure braid groups.
