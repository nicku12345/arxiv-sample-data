Pascal's triangle will give the number of geodesics from the identity to each point of {\bf Z}^2 if you write it in each of the quadrants. Given a group G and generating set \cal G we take the {\it Pascal's function} p_{\cal G}: G \to {\bf Z}_{\ge 0} to be the function which assigns to each g\in G the number of geodesics from 1 to g. We give a general method for calculating this in hyperbolic groups and discuss the generic case in abelian groups.
