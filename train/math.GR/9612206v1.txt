It is shown that there exist infinitely many non-integers r>2 such that the Dehn function of some finitely presented group is \simeq n^r. For each positive rational number s we construct pairs of finitely presented groups H\subset G such that the distortion of H in G is \simeq n^s. And for each s\ge 1 we also construct finitely presented groups whose isodiametric function is \simeq n^s.
