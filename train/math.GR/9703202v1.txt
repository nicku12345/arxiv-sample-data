Recently, Meierfrankenfeld has published three theorems on the cohomology of a finitary module. They cover the local determination of complete reducibility; the local splitting of group extensions; and the representation of locally split extensions in the double dual. In this note we derive all three by combining a certain duality between homology and cohomology with the continuity of homology.
