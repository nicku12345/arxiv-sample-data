We look at the automorphisms of Thompson type groups of piecewise linear homeomorphisms of the real line or circle that use slopes that are integral powers of a fixed integer n with n>2. We show that large numbers of "exotic" automorphisms appear---automorphisms that are represented as conjugation by non-PL homeomorphisms of the real line or circle. This is in contrast to the n=2 case where no such automorphisms appear.
