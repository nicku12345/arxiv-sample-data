We show that the quasiconvex subgroups in doubles of certain negatively curved groups are closed in the profinite topology. This allows us to construct the first known large family of hyperbolic 3-manifolds such that any finitely generated subgroup of the fundamental group of any member of the family is closed in the profinite topology.
