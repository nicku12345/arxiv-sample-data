This is a survey of recent progress in several areas of combinatorial algebra. We consider combinatorial problems about free groups, polynomial algebras, free associative and Lie algebras. Our main idea is to study automorphisms and, more generally, homomorphisms of various algebraic systems by means of their action on ``very small" sets of elements, as opposed to a traditional approach of studying their action on subsystems (like subgroups, normal subgroups; subalgebras, ideals, etc.) We will show that there is a lot that can be said about a homomorphism, given its action on just a single element, if this element is ``good enough". Then, we consider somewhat bigger sets of elements, like, for example, automorphic orbits, and study a variety of interesting problems arising in that framework.   One more point that we make here is that one can use similar combinatorial ideas in seemingly distant areas of algebra, like, for example, group theory and commutative algebra. In particular, we use the same language of ``elementary transformations" in different contexts and show that this approach appears to be quite fruitful for all the areas involved.
