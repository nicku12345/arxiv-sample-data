The goal of this paper is to construct quasi-isometrically embedded subgroups of Thompson's group F which are isomorphic to \fz^n for all n. A result estimating the norm of an element of Thompson's group is found. As a corollary, Thompson's group is seen to be an example of a finitely presented group which has an infinite-dimensional asymptotic cone.
