With the aim of completing the previous study by A. Or{\l}owski and the author concerning intertwining maps between induced representations and conjugation representation, termed here weighted class operators, we compute the latter explicitely for the conjugation representation arising from the regular representation in the group algebra of a compact group. To that efect a theorem of Wigner-- Eckart type for weighted class operators obtained from matrix coefficients of irreducible representations of a compact group is proved. Also the previous construction of weighted class operators is reviewed and extended to the case of locally compact groups rather then just compact ones.
