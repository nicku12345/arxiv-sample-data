We investigate the concept of dominion (in the sense of Isbell) in several varieties of nilpotent groups. We obtain a full description of dominions in the variety of nilpotent groups of class at most two. Then we look at the behavior of dominions of subgroups of groups in {\cal N}_2 when taken in the context of {\cal N}_c with c>2. Finally we establish the existence of nontrivial dominions in the category of all nilpotent groups.
