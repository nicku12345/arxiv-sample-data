A full characterization of when a subgroup H of a group G in a varietal product {\cal NQ} is epimorphically embedded in G (in the variety {\cal NQ}) is given. From this, a result of S.~McKay is derived, which states that if {\cal NQ} has instances of nonsurjective epimorphisms, then {\cal N} also has instances of nonsurjective epimorphisms. Two partial converses to McKay's result are also given: when~G is a finite nonabelian simple group; and when~G is finite and {\cal Q} is a product of varieties of nilpotent groups, each of which contains the infinite cyclic group.
