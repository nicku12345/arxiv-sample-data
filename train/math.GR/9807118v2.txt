Dominions, in the sense of Isbell, are investigated in the context of decomposable varieties of groups. An upper and lower bound for dominions in such a variety is given in terms of the two varietal factors, and the internal structure of the group being analyzed. Finally, the following result is established: If a variety {\cal N} has instances of nontrivial dominions, then for any proper subvariety {\cal Q} of {\cal G}roup, {\cal NQ} also has instances of nontrivial dominions.
