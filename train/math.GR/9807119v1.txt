Let~S be a finite nonabelian simple group, and let H be a subgroup of S. In this work, the dominion (in the sense of Isbell) of H in S in rmVar(S) is determined, generalizing an example of B.H. Neumann. A necessary and sufficient condition for H to be epimorphically embedded in S is obtained. These results are then extended to a variety generated by a family of finite nonabelian simple groups.
