We prove that numerous negatively curved simply connected locally compact polyhedral complexes, admitting a discrete cocompact group of automorphisms, have automorphism groups which are locally compact, uncountable, non linear and virtually simple. Examples include hyperbolic buildings, Cayley graphs of word hyperbolic Coxeter systems, and generalizations of cubical complexes, that we call even polyhedral complexes. We use tools introduced by Tits in the case of automorphism groups of trees, and Davis-Moussong's geometric realisation of Coxeter systems.
