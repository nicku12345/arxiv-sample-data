The partial group algebra of a group G over a field K, denoted by K_{par}(G), is the algebra whose representations correspond to the partial representations of G over K-vector spaces. In this paper we study the structure of the partial group algebra K_{par}(G), where G is a finite group. In particular, given two finite abelian groups G_1 and G_2, we prove that if the characteristic of K is zero, then K_{par}(G_1) is isomorphic to K_{par}(G_2) if and only if G_1 is isomorphic to G_2.
