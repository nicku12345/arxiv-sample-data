In 1980 Rostislav Grigorchuk constructed a group G of intermediate growth, and later obtained the following estimates on its growth \gamma: e^{\sqrt{n}}\precsim\gamma(n)\precsim e^{n^\beta}, where \beta=\log_{32}(31)\approx0.991. He conjectured that the lower bound is actually tight. In this paper we improve the lower bound to e^{n^\alpha}\precsim\gamma(n), where \alpha\approx0.5157, with the aid of a computer. This disproves the conjecture that the lower bound be tight.
