For any hyperbolic 3-manifold M with totally geodesic boundary, there are finitely many boundary slopes for essential immersed surfaces of a given genus. There is a uniform bound for the number of such boundary slopes if the genus of \partial M or the volume of M is bounded above. When the volume is bounded above, then area of \partial M is bounded above and the length of closed geodesic on \partial M is bounded below.
