We address a conjecture that \pi_1-surjective maps between closed aspherical 3-manifolds having the same rank on \pi_1 must be of non-zero degree. The conjecture is proved for Seifert manifolds, which is used in constructing the first known example of minimum Haken manifold. Another motivation is to study epimorphisms of 3-manifold groups via maps of non-zero degree between 3-manifolds.
