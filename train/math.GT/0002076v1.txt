We give three formulas expressing the Smale invariant of an immersion f of a (4k-1)-sphere into (4k+1)-space. The terms of the formulas are geometric characteristics of any generic smooth map g of any oriented 4k-dimensional manifold, where g restricted to the boundary is an immersion regularly homotopic to f in (6k-1)-space.   The formulas imply that if f and g are two non-regularly homotopic immersions of a (4k-1)-sphere into (4k+1)-space then they are also non-regularly homotopic as immersions into (6k-1)-space. Moreover, any generic homotopy in (6k-1)-space connecting f to g must have at least a_k(2k-1)! cusps, where a_k=2 if k is odd and a_k=1 if k is even.
