Let F_g denote the closed orientable surface of genus g. What is the least order finite group, G_g, for which there is a homomorphism \psi from \pi_1(F_g) to G_g so that no nontrivial simple closed curve on F_g represents an element in Ker(\psi)? For the torus it is easily seen that G_1 = Z_2 \times Z_2 suffices. We prove here that G_2 is a group of order 32 and that an upper bound for the order of G_g is given by g^{2g +1}. The previously known upper bound was greater than 2^{g{2^{2g}}}.
