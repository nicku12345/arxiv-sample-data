In 1993 K. Habiro defined C_k-move of oriented links and around 1994 he proved that two oriented knots are transformed into each other by C_k-moves if and only if they have the same Vassiliev invariants of order \leq k-1. In this paper we define Vassiliev invariant of type (k_1,...,k_l), and show that, for k=k_1+...+k_l, two oriented knots are transformed into each other by C_k-moves if and only if they have the same Vassiliev invariants of type (k_1,...,k_l). We introduce a concept ` band description of knots' and give a diagram-oriented proof of this theorem. When k_1=...=k_l=1, the Vassiliev invariant of type (k_1,...,k_l) coincides with the Vassiliev invariant of order \leq l-1 in the usual sense. As a special case, we have Habiro's theorem stated above.
