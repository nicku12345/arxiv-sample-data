We refine a Le and Murakami uniqueness theorem for the Kontsevich Integral in order to specify the relationship between the two (possibly equal) main universal link invariants: the Kontsevich Integral and the perturbative expression of the Chern-Simons theory. As a corollary, we prove that the Altschuler and Freidel anomaly (that groups the Bott and Taubes anomalous terms) is a combination of diagrams with two univalent vertices; and we explicitly define the isomorphism of the space of Feynman diagrams which transforms the Kontsevich Integral into the Poirier limit of the perturbative expression of the Chern-Simons theory, as a function of the anomaly. We use this corollary to improve the Le estimates on the denominators of the Kontsevich Integral.
