The perturbative expression of Chern-Simons theory for links in Euclidean 3-space is a linear combination of integrals on configuration spaces. This has successively been studied by Guadagnini, Martellini and Mintchev, Bar-Natan, Kontsevich, Bott and Taubes, D. Thurston, Altschuler and Freidel, Yang and others. We give a self-contained version of this study with a new choice of compactification, and we formulate a rationality result.
