This paper is a more succinct version of the author's 1993 UCLA mathematics thesis. It proves that any group quasi-isometric to the product of the hyperbolic plane with the real line is a finite extension of a cocompact lattice in either the isometry group of the product of the hyperbolic plane with the real line or the isometry group of the universal cover of SL(2,R).
