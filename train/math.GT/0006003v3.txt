One proves that there exists an obstruction to an open simply connected n-manifold of dimension n\geq 5 being geometrically simply connected. In particular there exist uncountably many simply connected n-manifolds which are not w.g.s.c. One proves that for n\neq 4 an n-manifold proper homotopy equivalent to a w.g.s.c. polyhedron is w.g.s.c. (for n=4 it is only end compressible). We analyze further the case n=4 and Po\'enaru's conjecture.
