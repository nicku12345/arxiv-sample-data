A pass-move and a #-move are local moves on oriented links defined by L.H. Kauffman and H. Murakami respectively. Two links are self pass-equivalent (resp. self #-equivalent) if one can be deformed into the other by pass-moves (resp. #-moves), where non of them can occur between distinct components of the link. These relations are equivalence relations on ordered oriented links and stronger than link-homotopy defined by J. Milnor. We give two complete classifications of links with arbitrarily many components up to self pass-equivalence and up to self #-equivalence respectively. So our classifications give subdivisions of link-homotopy classes.
