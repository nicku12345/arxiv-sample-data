We show that every p-fold strictly-cyclic branched covering of a b-bridge link in S^3 admits a p-symmetric Heegaard splitting - in the sense of Birman and Hilden - of genus g=(b-1)(p-1). This gives a complete converse of one of the results of the two authors. Moreover, we introduce the concept of weakly p-symmetric Heegaard splittings and prove similar results in this more general context.
