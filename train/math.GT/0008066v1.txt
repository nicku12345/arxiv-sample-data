The concordance orders of many algebraic order two knots of ten or fewer crossings have been heretofore unknown. We use Casson-Gordon invariants and twisted Alexander polynomials to find that, in all but one case, these knots do not have concordance order two. We also find that a certain family of algebraic order two twisted doubles of the unknot have infinite concordance order.
