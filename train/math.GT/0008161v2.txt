In this paper we construct a family of simply connected, spin, non-complex, symplectic 4-manifolds which cover all but finitely many allowed lattice points (\chi, c) lying in 0 \leq c \leq 8.76\chi. Furthermore, as a corollary, we prove that there exist infinitely many exotic smooth structures on (2n+1)(S^2 \times S^2) for all n large enough.
