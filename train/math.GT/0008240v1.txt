In this note, we investigate the relation between double points and complex points of immersed surfaces in almost-complex 4-manifolds and show how estimates for the minimal genus of embedded surfaces lead to inequalities between the number of double points and the number of complex points of an immersion. We also provide a generalization of a classical genus estimate due to V.A. Rokhlin to the case of immersed surfaces.
