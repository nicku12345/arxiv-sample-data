In a recent paper Hodgson and Kerckhoff prove a local rigidity theorem for finite volume, three dimensional hyperbolic cone-manifolds. In this paper we extend this result to geometrically finite cone-manifolds. Our methods also give a new proof of a local version of the classical rigidity theorem for geometrically finite hyperbolic 3-manifolds.
