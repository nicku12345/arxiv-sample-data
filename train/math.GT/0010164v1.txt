We present examples of hyperbolizable 3-manifolds M with the following property. Let CC(\pi_1(M)) denote the space of convex co-compact representations of \pi_1(M). We show that for every K\geq 1 there exists a representation \rho in \bar {CC(\pi_1(M))} so that every K-quasiconformal deformation of \rho lies in the closure of every component of CC(\pi_1(M)).   The examples M were discovered by Anderson and Canary.
