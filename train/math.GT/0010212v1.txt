Let K be a knot with an unknotting tunnel \gamma and suppose that K is not a 2-bridge knot. There is an invariant \rho = p/q \in \mathbb{Q}/2 \mathbb{Z}, p odd, defined for the pair (K, \gamma).   The invariant \rho has interesting geometric properties: It is often straightforward to calculate; e. g. for K a torus knot and \gamma an annulus-spanning arc, \rho(K, \gamma) = 1. Although \rho is defined abstractly, it is naturally revealed when K \cup \gamma is put in thin position. If \rho \neq 1 then there is a minimal genus Seifert surface F for K such that the tunnel \gamma can be slid and isotoped to lie on F. One consequence: if \rho(K, \gamma) \neq 1 then genus(K) > 1. This confirms a conjecture of Goda and Teragaito for pairs (K, \gamma) with \rho(K, \gamma) \neq 1.
