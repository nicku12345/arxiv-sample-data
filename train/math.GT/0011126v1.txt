Neumann and Reid described in their paper "Rigidity of cusps in deformations of hyperbolic 3-orbifolds" (Math Ann. 295 (1993) no. 2, 223--237) a 2-cusped hyperbolic 3-orbifold in which the cusps are geometrically isolated. Based on numerical evidence provided by Jeff Weeks' snappea program, they conjectured that the cusps are strongly geometrically isolated, a fact which we establish here. We also give a parameterization of the Dehn surgery space of this orbifold which has amusing properties.
