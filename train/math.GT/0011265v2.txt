We establish tools to facilitate the computation and application of the Chekanov-Eliashberg differential graded algebra (DGA), a Legendrian-isotopy invariant of Legendrian knots in standard contact three-space. More specifically, we reformulate the DGA in terms of front projection, and introduce the characteristic algebra, a new invariant derived from the DGA. We use our techniques to distinguish between several previously indistinguishable Legendrian knots and links.
