We establish the exact triangle in Seiberg-Witten-Floer theory relating the monopoloe homologies of any two closed 3-manifolds which are obtained from each other by \pm 1-surgery. We also show that the sum of the modified version of the Seiberg-Witten invariants for any closed rational homology 3-sphere Y over all Spin^c structures equals to \frac 12 |H_1(Y, \Z)| \lambda (Y) where \lambda (Y) is the Casson-Walker invariant.
