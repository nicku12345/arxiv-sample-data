Using the band representation of the 3-strand braid group, it is shown that the genus of 3-braid links can be read off their skein polynomial. Some applications are given, in particular a simple proof of Morton's conjectured inequality and a condition to decide that some polynomials, like the one of 9_{49}, are not admitted by 3-braid links. Finally, alternating links of braid index 3 are classified.
