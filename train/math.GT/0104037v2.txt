The cobordism group N(M^n) of codimension-one immersions in the n-manifold M^n has a natural filtration induced by any cellular decomposition. The problem addressed in this paper is the explicit computation of the graded group gr^*N(M^n). We introduce some new invariants for immersions enlightening the Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence associated to N(M), which are of combinatorial-geometric nature. Explicit computations are developed for n\leq7, and the group structure is also investigated for orientable 4-manifolds.
