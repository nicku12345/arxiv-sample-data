In this paper we define and investigate Z/2-homology cobordism invariants of Z/2-homology 3-spheres which turn out to be related to classical invariants of knots. As an application we show that many lens spaces have infinite order in the Z/2-homology cobordism group and we prove a lower bound for the slice genus of a knot on which integral surgery yields a given Z/2-homology sphere. We also give some new examples of 3-manifolds which cannot be obtained by integral surgery on a knot.
