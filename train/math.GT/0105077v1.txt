We give geometric formulae which enable us to detect (completely in some cases) the regular homotopy class of an immersion with trivial normal bundle of a closed oriented 3-manifold into 5-space. These are analogues of the geometric formulae for the Smale invariants due to Ekholm and the second author. As a corollary, we show that two embeddings into 5-space of a closed oriented 3-manifold with no 2-torsion in the second cohomology are regularly homotopic if and only if they have Seifert surfaces with the same signature. We also show that there exist two embeddings F_0 and F_8 : T^3 \hookrightarrow {\bf R}^5 of the 3-torus T^3 with the following properties: (1) F_0 \sharp h is regularly homotopic to F_8 for some immersion h : S^3 \looparrowright {\bf R}^5, and (2) the immersion h as above cannot be chosen from a regular homotopy class containing an embedding.
