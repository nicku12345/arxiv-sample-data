In this note, we prove a lower bound for the positive kinkiness of a closed braid which we then use to derive an estimate for the positive kinkiness of a link in terms of its Seifert system. As an application, we show that certain pretzel knots cannot be unknotted using only positive crossing changes. We also describe a subgroup of infinite rank in the smooth knot concordance group of which no element has a strongly quasipositive representative.
