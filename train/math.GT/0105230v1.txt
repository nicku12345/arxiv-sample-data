Let X be a G-space such that the orbit space X/G is metrizable. Suppose a family of slices is given at each point of X. We study a construction which associates, under some conditions on the family of slices, with any metric on X/G an invariant metric on X.   We show also that a family of slices with the required properties exists for any action of a countable group on a locally compact and locally connected metric space.
