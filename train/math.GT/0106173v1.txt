We define A_k-moves for embeddings of a finite graph into the 3-sphere for each natural number k. Let A_k-equivalence denote an equivalence relation generated by A_k-moves and ambient isotopy. A_k-equivalence implies A_{k-1}-equivalence. Let {\cal F} be an A_{k-1}-equivalence class of the embeddings of a finite graph into the 3-sphere. Let {\cal G} be the quotient set of {\cal F} under A_k-equivalence. We show that the set {\cal G} forms an abelian group under a certain geometric operation. We define finite type invariants on {\cal F} of order (n;k). And we show that if any finite type invariant of order (1;k) takes the same value on two elements of {\cal F}, then they are A_k-equivalent. A_k-move is a generalization of C_k-move defined by K. Habiro. Habiro showed that two oriented knots are the same up to C_k-move and ambient isotopy if and only if any Vassiliev invariant of order \leq k-1 takes the same value on them. The ` if' part does not hold for two-component links. Our result gives a sufficient condition for spatial graphs to be C_k-equivalent.
