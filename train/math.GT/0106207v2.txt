Following the recent work by T.-H. Chan in [HOMFLY polynomial of some generalized Hopf links, J. Knot Theory Ramif. 9 (2000) 865--883] on reverse string parallels of the Hopf link we give an alternative approach to finding the Homfly polynomials of these links, based on the Homfly skein of the annulus. We establish that two natural skein maps have distinct eigenvalues, answering a question raised by Chan, and use this result to calculate the Homfly polynomial of some more general reverse string satellites of the Hopf link.
