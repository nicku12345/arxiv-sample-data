A Seifert manifold is a 3-dimensional manifold with a circle action. It is a circle bundle (with singularities) over a 2-dimensional orbifold.   In this note, we discuss a generalized Seifert manifolds. By definition, they have bundle-like structures whose fibers are infra- homogeneous spaces; that is, the fibers are flat manifolds, almost flat manifolds, etc.   We prove existence, uniqueness, rigidity theorems. Many interesting properties and applications are presented.
