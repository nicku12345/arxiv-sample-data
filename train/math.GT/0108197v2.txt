A theory of signatures for odd-dimensional links in rational homology spheres is studied via their generalized Seifert surfaces. The jump functions of signatures are shown invariant under appropriately generalized concordance and a special care is given to accommodate 1-dimensional links with mutual linking. Furthermore our concordance theory of links in rational homology spheres remains highly nontrivial after factoring out the contribution from links in integral homology spheres.
