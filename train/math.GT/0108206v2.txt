The theory of signature invariants of links in rational homology spheres is applied to covering links of homology boundary links. From patterns and Seifert matrices of homology boundary links, an explicit formula is derived to compute signature invariants of their covering links. Using the formula, we produce fused boundary links that are positive mutants of ribbon links but are not concordant to boundary links. We also show that for any finite collection of patterns, there are homology boundary links that are not concordant to any homology boundary links admitting a pattern in the collection.
