We extend to the context of hyperbolic 3-manifolds with geodesic boundary Thurston's approach to hyperbolization by means of geometric triangulations. In particular, we introduce moduli for (partially) truncated hyperbolic tetrahedra, and we discuss consistency and completeness equations. Moreover, building on previous work of Ushijima, we extend Weeks' tilt formula algorithm, which computes the Epstein-Penner canonical triangulation, to an algorithm that computes the Kojima triangulation. The theory is particularly interesting in the case of complete finite-volume manifolds with geodesic boundary in which the boundary is non-compact. We include this case using a suitable adjustment of the notion of ideal triangulation, and we show that the case naturally arises within the theory of knots and links.
