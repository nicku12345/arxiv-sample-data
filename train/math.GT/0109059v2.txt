The main theorem of this paper is a generalisation of well known results about Dehn surgery to the case of attaching handlebodies to a simple 3-manifold. The existence of a finite set of `exceptional' curves on the boundary of the 3-manifold is established. Provided none of these curves is attached to the boundary of a disc in a handlebody, the resulting manifold is shown to be word hyperbolic and `hyperbolike'. We then give constructions of gluing maps satisfying this condition. These take the form of an arbitrary gluing map composed with powers of a suitable homeomorphism of the boundary of the handlebodies.
