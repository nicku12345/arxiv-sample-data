We study the effect of mutation on link concordance and 3-manifolds. We show that the set of links concordant to sublinks of homology boundary links is not closed under positive mutation. We show that mutation does not preserve homology cobordism classes of 3-manifolds. A significant consequence is that there exist 3-manifolds which have the same quantum SU(2)-invariants but are not homology cobordant. These results are obtained by investigating the effect of mutation on the Milnor invariants, or equivalently the Massey products.
