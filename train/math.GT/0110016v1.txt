We give examples of knots with some unusual properties of the crossing number of positive diagrams or strand number of positive braid representations. In particular we show that positive braid knots may not have positive minimal (strand number) braid representations, giving a counterpart to results of Franks-Williams and Murasugi. Other examples answer questions of Cromwell on homogeneous and (partially) of Adams on almost alternating knots.   We give a counterexample to, and a corrected version of a theorem of Jones on the Alexander polynomial of 4-braid knots. We also give an example of a knot on which all previously applied braid index criteria fail to estimate sharply (from below) the braid index. A relation between (generalizations of) such examples and a conjecture of Jones that a minimal braid representation has unique writhe is discussed.   Finally, we give a counterexample to Morton's conjecture relating the genus and degree of the skein polynomial.
