We take a first step towards understanding the relationship between foliations and universally tight contact structures on hyperbolic 3-manifolds. If a surface bundle over a circle has pseudo-Anosov holonomy, we obtain a classification of "extremal" tight contact structures. Specifically, there is exactly one contact structure whose Euler class, when evaluated on the fiber, equals the Euler number of the fiber. This rigidity theorem is a consequence of properties of the action of pseudo-Anosov maps on the complex of curves of the fiber and a remarkable flexibility property of convex surfaces in such a space. Indeed this flexibility may be seen in surface bundles over an interval where the analogous classification theorem is also established.
