Following Goussarov's paper `Interdependent Modifications of Links and Invariants of Finite Degree' [Topology 37 (1998) 595--602] we describe an alternative finite type theory of knots. While (as shown by Goussarov) the alternative theory turns out to be equivalent to the standard one, it nevertheless has its own share of intrinsic beauty.
