We prove a structure theorem for 3-manifolds with non-trivial JSJ-decomposition and 2-generated fundamental group. We deduce a variety of Corollaries. Note this is not a complete classification of such manifolds.   In particular we believe that one of the families in our list is empty. If you know something about hyperbolic 2-bridge knot exteriors and their finite sheeted covering spaces you might want to finish this off. Thanks.
