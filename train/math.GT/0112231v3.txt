We show that every p-fold strictly-cyclic branched covering of a b-bridge link in the 3-sphere admits a p-symmetric Heegaard splitting of genus g=(b-1)(p-1). This gives a complete converse to a result of Birman and Hilden, and gives an intrinsic characterization of p-symmetric Heegaard splittings as p-fold strictly-cyclic branched coverings of links.
