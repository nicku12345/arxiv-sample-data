We consider the following properties of compact oriented irreducible graph-manifolds: to contain a \pi_1-injective surface (immersed, virtually embedded or embedded), be (virtually) fibered over S^1, and to carry a metric of nonpositive sectional curvature.   It turns out that all these properties can be described from a unified point of view.
