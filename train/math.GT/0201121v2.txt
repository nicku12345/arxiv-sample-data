Let M be S^3, S^1\times S^2, or a lens space L(p,q), and let k be a (1,1)-knot in M, i.e., a knot which is of 1-bridge with respect to a Heegaard torus. We show that if there is a closed meridionally incompressible surface in the complement of k, then the surface and the knot can be put in a special position, namely, the surface is the boundary of a regular neighborhood of a toroidal graph, and the knot is level with respect to that graph. As an application we show that for any such M there exist tunnel number one knots which are not (1,1)-knots.
