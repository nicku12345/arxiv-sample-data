We define a graph algebra version of the stationary phase integration over the coadjoint orbits in the Reshetikhin formula for the colored Jones-HOMFLY polynomial. As a result, we obtain a `universal' U(1)-RCC invariant of links in rational homology spheres, which determines the U(1)-RCC invariants based on simple Lie algebras. We formulate a rationality conjecture about the structure of this invariant.
