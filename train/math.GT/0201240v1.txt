For any triple (W,L,\rho), where W is a closed connected and oriented 3-manifold, L is a link in W and \rho is a flat principal B-bundle over W (B is the Borel subgroup of SL(2,\mc)), one constructs a \Dd-scissors congruence class \cG_{\Dd}(W,L,\rho) which belongs to a (pre)-Bloch group \Pp (\Dd). The class \cG_{\Dd}(W,L,\rho) may be represented by \Dd-triangulations \Tt=(T,H,\Dd) of (W,L,\rho). For any \Tt and any odd integer N>1, one defines a ``quantization'' \Tt_N of \Tt based on the representation theory of the quantum Borel subalgebra \Ww_N of U_q(sl(2,\mc)) specialized at the root of unity \omega_N = \exp (2\pi i/N). Then one defines an invariant state sum K_N(W,L,\rho):= K(\Tt_N) called a quantum hyperbolic invariant (QHI) of (W,L,\rho). One introduces the class of hyperbolic-like triples. They carry also a classical scissors congruence class \cG_{\Ii}(W,L,\rho), that belongs to the classical (pre)-Bloch group \Pp (\Ii) and may be represented by explicit idealizations \Tt_{\Ii} of some \Dd-triangulations \Tt of a special type. One shows that \cG_{\Ii}(W,L,\rho) lies in the kernel of a generalized Dehn homomorphism defined on \Pp (\Ii), and that it induces an element of H_3^\delta(PSL(2,\mc);\mz) (discrete homology). One proves that  \lim_{N\to \infty} (2i\pi/N^2) \log [K_N(W,L,\rho)] = G(W,L,\rho) essentially depends of the geometry of the ideal triangulations representing \cG_{\Ii}(W,L,\rho), and one motivates the strong reformulation of the Volume Conjecture, which would identify G(W,L,\rho) with the evaluation R(\cG_{\Ii}(W,L,\rho)) of a certain refinement of the classical Rogers dilogarithm on the \Ii-scissors class.
