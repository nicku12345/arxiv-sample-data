An oriented link L in a 3-sphere S in complex 2-space is a C-boundary if it bounds a piece of algebraic curve in the 4-ball bounded by S. Using Kronheimer and Mrowka's proof of the Thom Conjecture, we construct many oriented knots which are not concordant to a C-boundary. We use the two-variable HOMFLY polynomial to give an obstruction to a knot's being a C-boundary in a strictly pseudoconvex S. We make several conjectures.
