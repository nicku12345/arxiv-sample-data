Kricker constructed a knot invariant Z^{rat} valued in a space of Feynman diagrams with beads. When composed with the so called "hair" map H, it gives the Kontsevich integral of the knot. We introduce a new grading on diagrams with beads and use it to show that a non trivial element constructed from Vogel's zero divisor in the algebra \Lambda\ is in the kernel of H. This shows that H is not injective.
