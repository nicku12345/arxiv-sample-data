Torsion and Betti numbers for knots are special cases of more general invariants associated to a finitely generated group G and epimorphism from G to the integers. The sequence of Betti numbers is always periodic; under mild hypotheses, the sequence of torsion numbers satisfies a linear homogeneous recurrence relation with constant coeffiencts. Generally, the torsion number sequence exhibits exponential growth rate. However, again under mild hypotheses, the p-part has trivial growth for any prime p. Applications to branched cover homology for knots and links are presented.
