Many examples of nonpositively curved closed manifolds arise as blow-ups of projective hyperplane arrangements. If the hyperplane arrangement is associated to a finite reflection group W, and the blow-up locus is W-invariant, then the resulting manifold M will admit a cell decomposition whose maximal cells are all combinatorially isomorphic to a given convex polytope P. In other words, M admits a tiling with tile P. The universal covers of such examples yield tilings of R^n whose symmetry groups are generated by involutions but are not, in general, reflection groups. We begin a study of these ``mock reflection groups'', and develop a theory of tilings that includes the examples coming from blow-ups and that generalizes the corresponding theory of reflection tilings. We apply our general theory to classify the examples coming from blow-ups in the case where the tile P is either the permutohedron or the associahedron.
