The Lawrence-Krammer representation of the braid groups recently came to prominence when it was shown to be faithful by myself and Krammer. It is an action of the braid group on a certain homology module H_2(\tilde{C}) over the ring of Laurent polynomials in q and t. In this paper we describe some surfaces in \tilde{C} representing elements of homology. We use these to give a new proof that H_2(\tilde{C}) is a free module. We also show that the (n-2,2) representation of the Temperley-Lieb algebra is the image of a map to relative homology at t=-q^{-1}, clarifying work of Lawrence.
