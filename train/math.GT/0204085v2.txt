Cubic complexes appear in the theory of finite type invariants so often that one can ascribe them to basic notions of the theory. In this paper we begin the exposition of finite type invariants from the `cubic' point of view. Finite type invariants of knots and homology 3-spheres fit perfectly into this conception. In particular, we get a natural explanation why they behave like polynomials.
