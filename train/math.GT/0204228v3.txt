We classify all the non-hyperbolic Dehn fillings of the complement of the chain-link with 3 components, conjectured to be the smallest hyperbolic 3-manifold with 3 cusps. We deduce the classification of all non-hyperbolic Dehn fillings of infinitely many 1-cusped and 2-cusped hyperbolic manifolds, including most of those with smallest known volume. Among other consequences of this classification, we mention the following:   - for every integer n we can prove that there are infinitely many hyperbolic knots in the 3-sphere having exceptional surgeries n, n+1, n+2, n+3, with n+1, n+2 giving small Seifert manifolds and n, n+3 giving toroidal manifolds;   - we exhibit a 2-cusped hyperbolic manifold that contains a pair of inequivalent knots having homeomorphic complements;   - we exhibit a chiral 3-manifold containing a pair of inequivalent hyperbolic knots with orientation-preservingly homeomorphic complements;   - we give explicit lower bounds for the maximal distance between small Seifert fillings and any other kind of exceptional filling.
