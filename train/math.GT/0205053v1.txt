The number of colorings of a knot diagram by a quandle has been shown to be a knot invariant by CJKLS using quandle cohomology methods. In a previous paper by the second named author, the CJKLS invariant was refined and, in particular, it was shown that the number of colorings is an invariant directly without resorting to quandle cohomology. Here we investigate the effectiveness of this invariant on (classical) knots of up to and including ten crossings.
