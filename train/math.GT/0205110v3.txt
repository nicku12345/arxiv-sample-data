The possibilities for new or unusual kinds of topological, locally linear periodic maps of non-prime order on closed, simply connected 4-manifolds with positive definite intersection pairings are explored. On the one hand, certain permutation representations on homology are ruled out under appropriate hypotheses. On the other hand, an interesting homologically nontrivial, pseudofree, action of the cyclic group of order 25 on a connected sum of ten copies of the complex projective plane is constructed.
