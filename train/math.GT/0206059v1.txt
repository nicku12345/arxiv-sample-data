We provide new information about the structure of the abelian group of topological concordance classes of knots in S^3. One consequence is that there is a subgroup of infinite rank consisting entirely of knots with vanishing Casson-Gordon invariants but whose non-triviality is detected by L^{(2)} signatures.
