We study the way a strongly irreducible Heegaard surface \Sigma intersects a knot exterior X embedded in a 3-manifold, and show that if \Sigma \cap \partial X consists of simple closed curves which are essential in both \Sigma and \partial X, then the intersection X \cap \Sigma consists of meridional annuli only. As an application we show that when considering two Heegaard surfaces that intersect essentially and spinally (cf. Rubinstein and Shcarlemann) any embedded torus in the union of the two bounds a solid torus.
