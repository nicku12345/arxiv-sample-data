In this note, I will discuss a possible relation between the Mahler measure of the colored Jones polynomial and the volume conjecture. In particular, I will study the colored Jones polynomial of the figure-eight knot on the unit circle. I will also propose a method to prove the volume conjecture for satellites of the figure-eight knot.
