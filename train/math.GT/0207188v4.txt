We show how the space of complex spin structures of a closed oriented three-manifold embeds naturally into a space of quadratic functions associated to its linking pairing. Besides, we extend the Goussarov-Habiro theory of finite type invariants to the realm of compact oriented three-manifolds equipped with a complex spin structure. Our main result states that two closed oriented three-manifolds endowed with a complex spin structure are undistinguishable by complex spin invariants of degree zero if, and only if, their associated quadratic functions are isomorphic.
