In a previous paper [Homology cylinders: an enlargement of the mapping class group, Algebr. Geom. Topol. 1 (2001) 243--270, arXiv:math.GT/0010247], a group H_g of homology cylinders over the oriented surface of genus g is defined. A filtration of H_g is defined, using the Goussarov-Habiro notion of finite-type. It is erroneously claimed that this filtration essentially coincides with the relative weight filtration. The present note corrects this error and studies the actual relation between the two filtrations.
