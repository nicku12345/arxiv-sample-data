In this paper we give a complete description of the space  \QF  of quasifuchsian punctured torus groups in terms of what we call {\em pleating invariants}. These are natural invariants of the boundary \bch of the convex core of the associated hyperbolic 3-manifold M and give coordinates for the non-Fuchsian groups \QF - \F. The pleating invariants of a component of \bch consist of the projective class of its bending measure, together with the lamination length of a fixed choice of transverse measure in this class. Our description complements that of Minsky in \cite{MinskyPT}, in which he describes the space of all punctured torus groups in terms of {\em ending invariants} which characterize the asymptotic geometry of the ends of M.   Pleating invariants give a quasifuchsian analog of the Kerckhoff-Thurston description of Fuchsian space by critical lines and earthquake horocycles. The critical lines extend to {\em pleating planes} on which the pleating loci of \bch are constant and the horocycles extend to {\em BM-slices} on which the pleating invariants of one component of \bch are fixed.   We prove that the pleating planes corresponding to rational laminations are dense and that their boundaries can be found {\em explicitly}. This means, answering questions posed by Bers in the late 1960's, that it is possible to compute an arbitrarily accurate picture of the shape of any embedding of \QF into \CC^2.
