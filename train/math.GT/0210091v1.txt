Contact structures on 3-manifolds are analyzed by decomposing the manifold along convex surfaces. Background results of Giroux, Eliashberg, Colin, and Honda are discussed with an emphasis on examples. Convex decompositions are then used to give a new proof of the Gabai-Eliashberg-Thurston Theorem on the existence of universally tight contact structures and also to study the contact topology of a space in the presence or absence of tori. Classification of tight contact structures on fibred manifolds and related open questions are also discussed. This paper is based on a series of talks given at the Tokyo Institute of Technology from Jun 3-7, 2002.
