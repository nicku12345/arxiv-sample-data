We show that every co--orientable taut foliation F of an orientable, atoroidal 3-manifold admits a transverse essential lamination. If this transverse lamination is a foliation G, the pair F,G are the unstable and stable foliation respectively of an Anosov flow. Otherwise, F admits a pair of transverse very full genuine laminations.   In the second case, M satisfies the weak geometrization conjecture - either its fundamental group contains Z+Z or it is word-hyperbolic. Moreover, if M is atoroidal, the mapping class group of M is finite, and any automorphism homotopic to the identity is isotopic to the identity.
