Let H^n be the hyperbolic n-space with n\geq 2. Suppose that \Gamma<Isom H^n is a discrete, torsion free subgroup and a is a point in the domain of discontinuity \Omega(\Gamma). Let p be the projection map from H^n to the quotient manifold M=H^n/\Gamma. In this paper we prove that there exists an open neighborhood U of a in H^n\cup\Omega(\Gamma) such that p is an isometry on U\cap H^n.
