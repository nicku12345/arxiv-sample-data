We classify all closed non-orientable P2-irreducible 3-manifolds having complexity up to 6 and we describe some having complexity 7. We show in particular that there is no such manifold with complexity less than 6, and that those having complexity 6 are precisely the 4 flat non-orientable ones and the filling of the Gieseking manifold, which is of type Sol. The manifolds having complexity 7 we describe are Seifert manifolds of type H2 x S1 and a manifold of type Sol.
