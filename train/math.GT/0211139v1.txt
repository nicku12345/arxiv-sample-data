Let S be a closed, connected, orientable surface of genus at least 3, \mathcal{C}(S) be the complex of curves on S and Mod_S^* be the extended mapping class group of S. We prove that a simplicial map, \lambda: \mathcal{C}(S) \to \mathcal{C}(S), preserves nondisjointness (i.e. if \alpha and \beta are two vertices in \mathcal{C}(S) and i(\alpha, \beta) \neq 0, then i(\lambda(\alpha), \lambda(\beta)) \neq 0) iff it is induced by a homeomorphism of S. As a corollary, we prove that if K is a finite index subgroup of Mod_S^* and f: K \to Mod_S^* is an injective homomorphism, then f is induced by a homeomorphism of S and f has a unique extension to an automorphism of Mod_S^*.
