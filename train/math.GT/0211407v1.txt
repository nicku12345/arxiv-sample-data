Given (V_1,V_2) a Heegaard splitting of the complement of a composite knot K=K_1# K_2 in S^3, where K_i, i=1,2 are prime knots, we have a unique, up to isotopy, decomposing annulus A. When the intersection of A and V_1 is a minimal collection of disks we study the components of V_1-N(A) and show that at most one component is a 3-ball meeting A in two disks. This is a crucial step in proving the conjecture that a necessary and sufficient condition for the tunnel number of a connected sum to be less than or equal to the sum of the tunnel numbers is that one of the knots has a Heegaard splitting in which a merdian curve is primitive.
