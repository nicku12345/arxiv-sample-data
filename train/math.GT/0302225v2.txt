We prove the existence of a finite set of moves sufficient to relate any two representations of the same 3-manifold as a 4-fold simple branched covering of S^3. We also prove a stabilization result: after adding a fifth trivial sheet two local moves suffice. These results are analogous to results of Piergallini in degree 3 and can be viewed as a second step in a program to establish similar results for arbitrary degree coverings of S^3.
