In this paper we investigate the distances between Dehn fillings on a hyperbolic 3-manifold that yield 3-manifolds containing essential small surfaces including non-orientable surfaces. Especially we study the situations where one filling creates an essential sphere or projective plane, and the other creates an essential sphere, projective plane, annulus, Moebius band, torus or Klein bottle,all 11 pairs of such non-hyperbolic manifolds.
