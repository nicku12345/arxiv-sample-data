In this paper we consider two connected closed Haken manifolds denoted by M^3 and N^3, with the same Gromov simplicial volume. We give a simple homological criterion to decide when a given map f: M^3-->N^3 between M^3 and N^3 can be changed by a homotopy to a homeomorphism. We then give a convenient process for constructing maps between M^3 and N^3 satisfying the homological hypothesis of the map f.
