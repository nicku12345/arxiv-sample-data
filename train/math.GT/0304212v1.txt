In this paper we survey some work on representations of B_n given by the induced action on a homology module of some space. One of these, called the Lawrence-Krammer representation, recently came to prominence when it was shown to be faithful for all n. We will outline the methods used, applying them to a closely related representation for which the proof is slightly easier. The main tool is the Blanchfield pairing, a sesquilinear pairing between elements of relative homology. We discuss two other applications of the Blanchfield pairing, namely a proof that the Burau representation is not faithful for large n, and a homological definition of the Jones polynomial. Finally, we discuss possible applications to the representation theory of the Hecke algebra, and ultimately of the symmetric group over fields of non-zero characteristic.
