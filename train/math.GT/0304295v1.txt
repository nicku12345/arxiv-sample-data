In low dimensional topology, we have some invariants defined by using solutions of some nonlinear elliptic operators. The invariants could be understood as Euler class or degree in the ordinary cohomology, in infinite dimensional setting. Instead of looking at the solutions, if we can regard some kind of homotopy class of the operator itself as an invariant, then the refined version of the invariant is understood as Euler class or degree in cohomotopy theory. This idea can be carried out for the Seiberg-Witten equation on 4-dimensional manifolds and we have some applications to 4-dimensional topology.
