First the title could be also understood as ``3-manifolds related by non-zero degree maps" or "Degrees of maps between 3-manifolds" for some aspects in this survey talk. The topology of surfaces was completely understood at the end of 19th century, but maps between surfaces kept to be an active topic in the 20th century and many important results just appeared in the last 25 years. The topology of 3-manifolds was well-understood only in the later 20th century, and the topic of non-zero degree maps between 3-manifolds becomes active only rather recently. We will survey questions and results in the topic indicated by the title, present its relations to 3-manifold topology and its applications to problems in geometry group theory, fixed point theory and dynamics. There are four aspects addressed: (1) Results concerning the existence and finiteness about the maps of non-zero degree (in particular of degree one) between 3-manifolds and their suitable correspondence about epimorphisms on knot groups and 3-manifold groups. (2) A measurement of the topological complexity on 3-manifolds and knots given by "degree one map partial order", and the interactions between the studies of non-zero degree map among 3-manifolds and of topology of 3-manifolds. (3) The standard forms of non-zero degree maps and automorphisms on 3-manifolds and applications to minimizing the fixed points in the isotopy class. (4) The uniqueness of the covering degrees between 3-manifolds and the uniqueness embedding indices (in particular the co-Hopfian property) between Kleinian groups. The methods used are varied, and we try to describe them briefly.
