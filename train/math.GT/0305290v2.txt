We show if M is a closed, connected, orientable, hyperbolic 3-manifold with Heegaard genus g then g >= 1/2 cosh(r) where r denotes the radius of any isometrically embedded ball in M. Assuming an unpublished result of Pitts and Rubinstein improves this to g >= 1/2 cosh(r) + 1/2. We also give an upper bound on the volume in terms of the flip distance of a Heegaard splitting, and describe isoperimetric surfaces in hyperbolic balls.
