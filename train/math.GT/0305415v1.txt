The Kauffman-Harary conjecture states that for any reduced alternating diagram K of a knot with a prime determinant p, every non-trivial Fox p-coloring of K assigns different colors to its arcs. We generalize the conjecture by stating it in terms of homology of the double cover of S^3 branched along a link.   In this way we extend the scope of the conjecture to all prime alternating links of arbitrary determinants. We first prove the Kauffman-Harary conjecture for pretzel knots and then we generalize our argument to show the generalized Kauffman-Harary conjecture for all Montesinos links. Finally, we speculate on the relation between the conjecture and Menasco's work on incompressible surfaces in exteriors of alternating links.
