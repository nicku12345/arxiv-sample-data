The main result of the present paper is a coincidence formula for foliated manifolds. To prove this we establish Kuenneth formula, Poincare duality and intersection product in the context of tangential de Rham cohomology and homology of tangential currents.   We apply the formula to get a dynamical Lefschetz formula for foliated flows.
