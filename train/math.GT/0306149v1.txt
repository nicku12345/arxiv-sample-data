We study the eta-invariants of links and show that in many cases they form link concordance invariants, in particular that many eta-invariants vanish for slice links. This result contains and generalizes previous invariants by Smolinsky and Cha--Ko. We give a formula for the eta-invariant for boundary links. In several intersting cases this allows us to show that a given link is not slice. We show that even more eta-invariants have to vanish for boundary slice links. We give an example of a boundary link L that is not boundary slice but where all the known link concordance invariants computed so far are zero.
