Recently, the explicit volume formulae for hyperbolic cone-manifolds, whose underlying space is the 3-sphere and the singular set is the knot 4_1 and the links 5^2_1 and 6^2_2, have been obtained by the second named author and his collaborators. In this paper we explicitly find the hyperbolic volume for cone-manifolds with the link 6^2_3 as singular set. Trigonometric identities (Tangent, Sine and Cosine Rules) between complex lengths of singular components and cone angles are obtained for an infinite family of two-bridge links containing 5^2_1 and 6^2_3.
