We investigate great circle links in the three-sphere, the class of links where each component is a great circle. Using the geometry of their complements, we classify such links up to five components. For any two-bridge knot complement, there is a finite cover that is the complement of a link of great circles in S^3. We show that for many two-bridge knots, this cover contains a closed incompressible surface. Infinitely many fillings of the two-bridge knot lift to fillings of great circle link where the incompressibility of this surface is preserved. Using this, we show that infinitely many fillings of an infinite class of two-bridge knot complements are virtually Haken.
