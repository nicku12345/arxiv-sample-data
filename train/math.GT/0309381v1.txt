For any g>1 we construct a graph G_g in S^3 whose exterior M_g supports a complete finite-volume hyperbolic structure with one toric cusp and a connected geodesic boundary of genus g. We compute the canonical decomposition and the isometry group of M_g, showing in particular that any self-homeomorphism of M_g extends to a self-homeomorphism of the pair (S^3,G_g), and that G_g is chiral. Building on a result of Lackenby we also show that any non-meridinal Dehn filling of M_g is hyperbolic, thus getting an infinite family of graphs in S^2xS^1 whose exteriors support a hyperbolic structure with geodesic boundary.
