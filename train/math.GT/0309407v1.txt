This chapter from the upcoming Handbook of Knot Theory (eds. Menasco and Thistlethwaite) shows how to construct hyperbolic structures on link complements and perform hyperbolic Dehn filling. Along with a new elementary exposition of the standard ideas from Thurston's work, the article includes never-before-published explanations of SnapPea's algorithms for triangulating a link complement efficiently and for converging quickly to the hyperbolic structure while avoiding singularities in the parameter space.
