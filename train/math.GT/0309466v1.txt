In 1978, W. Thurston revolutionized low diemsional topology with his work on hyperbolic 3-manifolds. In this paper, we discuss what is currently known about knots in the 3-sphere with hyperbolic complements. Then focus is on geometric invariants coming out of the hyperbolic structures. This is one of a collection of articles to appear in the Handbook of Knot Theory.
