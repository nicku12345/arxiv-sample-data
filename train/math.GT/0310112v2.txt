Let M be a closed, oriented and smooth manifold of dimension d. Let \L M be the space of smooth loops in M. Chas and Sullivan introduced loop product, a product of degree -d on the homology of LM. In this paper we show how for three manifolds the ``nontriviality'' of the loop product relates to the ``hyperbolicity'' of the underlying manifold. This is an application of the existing powerful tool and results in three dimensional topology such as the prime decomposition, torus decomposition, Seifert theorem, torus theorem.
