The signature function of a knot is a locally constant integer valued function with domain the unit circle. The jumps (i.e., the discontinuities) of the signature function can occur only at the roots of the Alexander polynomial on the unit circle. The latter are important in deforming U(1) representations of knot groups to irreducible SU(2) representations. Under the assumption that these roots are simple, we formulate a conjecture that explicitly computes the jumps of the signature function in terms of the Jones polynomial of a knot and its parallels. As evidence, we prove our conjecture for torus knots, and also (using computer calculations) for knots with at most 8 crossings. We also give a formula for the jump function at simple roots in terms of relative signs of Alexander polynomials.
