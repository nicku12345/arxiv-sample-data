We show that if V^3 is a handlebody in \R^3, with curves J_1, ..., J_g \subset \partial V which are the attaching curves for a Heegaard splitting of a homology sphere, then there exists a homeomorphism h\colon V \to V so that each of the curves h(J_i) bounds an orientable surface in \R^3 - int(V). This leads to a new characterization of homology spheres and also contradicts a remark of Haken (in 1969) regarding the Poincar\'e homology sphere.
