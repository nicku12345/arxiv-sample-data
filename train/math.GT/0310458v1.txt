Let p\geq 2 and q\neq 0 an integer. A knot K in the three-sphere is said to be a (p,q)-lens knot if and only if it covers a link in the lens space L(p,q). In this paper, we use the second coefficient of the HOMFLY polynomial to provide a necessary condition for a knot to be a (p,q)-lens knot. As an application, it is shown that this criterion rules out the possibility of being (5,1)-lens for 80 among the 84 knots with less than 9 crossings.
