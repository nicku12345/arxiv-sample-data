In this paper we prove that if M_K is the complement of a non-fibered twist knot K in \mathbb S^3, then M_K is not commensurable to a fibered knot complement in a \mathbb Z/ 2 \mathbb Z-homology sphere. To prove this result we derive a recursive description of the character variety of twist knots and then prove that a commensurability criterion developed by D. Calegari and N. Dunfield is satisfied for these varieties. In addition, we partially extend our results to a second infinite family of 2-bridge knots.
