We present a combinatorial method for a calculation of knot Floer homology with Z-coefficient of (1,1)-knots, and then demonstrate it for non-alternating (1,1)-knots with ten crossings and the pretzel knots of type (-2,m,n). Our calculations determine the unknotting numbers and 4-genera of the pretzel knots of this type.
