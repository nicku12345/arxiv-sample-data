We apply Murasugi-Tristram inequality to real algebraic curves of odd degree on RP^2 with a deep nest, i.e. a nest of the depth k-1 where 2k+1 is the degree. For such curves, the ingredients of the Murasugi-Tristram inequality can be computed (or estimated) inductively using the computations for iterated torus links due to Eisenbud and Neumann as the base of the induction and Conway's skein relation as the induction step.   In Appendix B, we give some generalization of the skein relation.
