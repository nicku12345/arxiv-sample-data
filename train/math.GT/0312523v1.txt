This is a survey article on the stable cohomotopy refinement of Seiberg-Witten invariants containing also new results, for example:   - Stable cohomotopy groups describe path components of certain mapping spaces.   - Relation of stable cohomotopy invariants to Seiberg-Witten invariants without restriction on Betti numbers.   - Theorem on connected sums along (-2)-spheres.
