Hempel has shown that the fundamental groups of knot complements are residually finite. This implies that every nontrivial knot must have a finite-sheeted, noncyclic cover. We give an explicit bound, \Phi (c), such that if K is a nontrivial knot in the three-sphere with a diagram with c crossings and a particularly simple JSJ decomposition then the complement of K has a finite-sheeted, noncyclic cover with at most \Phi (c) sheets.
