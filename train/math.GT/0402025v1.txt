Given a knot K in a closed orientable manifold M we define the growth rate of the tunnel number of K to be gr_t(K) = \limsup_{n \to \infty} \frac{t(nK) - n t(K)}{n-1}. As our main result we prove that the Heegaard genus of M is strictly less than the Heegaard genus of the knot exterior if and only if the growth rate is less than 1. In particular this shows that a non-trivial knot in S^3 is never asymptotically super additive. The main result gives conditions that imply falsehood of Morimoto's Conjecture.
