We construct a hyperbolic 3-manifold M (with \partial M totally geodesic) which contains no essential closed surfaces, but for any even integer g> 0 there are infinitely many separating slopes r on \partial M so that M[r], the 3-manifold obtained by attaching 2-handle to M along r, contains an essential separating closed surface of genus g and is still hyperbolic. The result contrasts sharply with those known finiteness results for the cases g=0,1. Our 3-manifold M is the complement of a simple small knot in a handlebody.
