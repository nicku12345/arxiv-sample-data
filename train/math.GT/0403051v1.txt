Automorphisms of handlebodies arise naturally in the a classification of automorphisms of three-manifolds. Among automorphisms of handlebodies, there are certain automorphisms called irreducible (or generic), which are analogues of pseudo-Anosov automorphisms of surfaces. We show that irreducible automorphisms of handlebodies exist and develop methods for constructing a range of examples.
