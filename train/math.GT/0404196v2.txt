We construct nontrivial cohomology classes of the space Imb(S^1,\R^n) of imbeddings of the circle into \R^n, by means of Feynman diagrams. More precisely, starting from a suitable linear combination of nontrivalent diagrams, we construct, for every even number n\geq 4, a de Rham cohomology class on Imb(S^1,\R^n). We prove nontriviality of these classes by evaluation on the dual cycles.
