We provide a combinatorial condition characterizing curves that are short along a Teichmueller geodesic. This condition is closely related to the condition provided by Minsky for curves in a hyperbolic 3-manifold to be short. We show that short curves in a hyperbolic manifold homeomorphic to S x R are also short in the corresponding Teichmueller geodesic, and we provide examples demonstrating that the converse is not true.
