In this paper we introduce a new invariant of virtual knots and links that is non-trivial for infinitely many virtuals, but is trivial on classical knots and links. The invariant is initially be expressed in terms of a relative of the bracket polynomial and then extracted from this polynomial in terms of its exponents, particularly for the case of knots. This analog of the bracket polynomial will be denoted {K} (with curly brackets) and called the binary bracket polynomial. The key to the combinatorics of the invariant is an interpretation of the state sum in terms of 2-colorings of the associated diagrams. For virtual knots, the new invariant, J(K), is a restriction of the writhe to the odd crossings of the diagram (A crossing is odd if it links an odd number of crossings in the Gauss code of the knot. The set of odd crossings is empty for a classical knot.) For K a virtual knot, J(K) non-zero implies that K is non-trivial, non-classical and inequivalent to its planar mirror image. The paper also condsiders generalizations of the two-fold coloring of the states of the binary bracket to cases of three and more colors. Relationships with graph coloring and the Four Color Theorem are discussed.
