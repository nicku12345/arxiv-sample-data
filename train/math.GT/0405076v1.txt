We show how the signed evaluations of link polynomials can be used to calculate unknotting numbers. We use the Jones-Rong value of the Brandt-Lickorish-Millett-Ho polynomial Q to calculate the unknotting numbers of 8_{16}, 9_{49} and 6 further new entries in Kawauchi's tables. Another method is developed by applying and extending the linking form criterion of Lickorish. This leads to several conjectured relations between the Jones value of Q and the linking form.
