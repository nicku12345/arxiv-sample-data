We study the asymptotic behaviors of the colored Jones polynomials of torus knots. Contrary to the works by R. Kashaev, O. Tirkkonen, Y. Yokota, and the author, they do not seem to give the volumes or the Chern-Simons invariants of the three-manifolds obtained by Dehn surgeries. On the other hand it is proved that in some cases the limits give the inverse of the Alexander polynomial.
