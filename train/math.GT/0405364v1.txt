For any two disjoint oriented circles embedded into the 3-dimensional real projective space, we construct a 3-dimensional configuration space and its map to the projective space such that the linking number of the circles is the half of the degree of the map. Similar interpretations are given for the linking number of cycles in a projective space of arbitrary odd dimension and the self-linking number of a zero homologous knot in the 3-dimensional projective space.
