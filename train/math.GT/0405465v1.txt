New obstructions for embedding one compact oriented 3-manifold in another are given. A theorem of D. Krebes concerning 4-tangles embedded in links arises as a special case. Algebraic and skein-theoretic generalizations for 2n-tangles provide invariants that persist in the corresponding invariants of links in which they embed. An example is given of a virtual 4-tangle for which Krebes's theorem does not hold.
