J.P. Levine showed that the Conway polynomial of a link is a product of two factors: one is the Conway polynomial of a knot which is obtained from the link by banding together the components; and the other is determined by the \bar{\mu}-invariants of a string link with the link as its closure. We give another description of the latter factor: the determinant of a matrix whose entries are linking pairings in the infinite cyclic covering space of the knot complement, which take values in the quotient field of {\Bbb Z}[t,t^{-1}]. In addition, we give a relation between the Taylor expansion of a linking pairing around t=1 and derivation on links which is invented by T.D. Cochran. In fact, the coefficients of the powers of t-1 will be the linking numbers of certain derived links in S^3. Therefore, the first non-vanishing coefficient of the Conway polynomial is determined by the linking numbers in S^3. This generalizes a result of J. Hoste.
