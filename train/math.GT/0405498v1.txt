In this paper we first give a one-move version of Markov's braid theorem for knot isotopy in S^3 that sharpens the classical theorem. Then a relative version of Markov's theorem concerning a fixed braided portion in the knot. We also prove an analogue of Markov's theorem for knot isotopy in knot complements. Finally we extend this last result to prove a Markov theorem for links in an arbitrary orientable 3--manifold.
