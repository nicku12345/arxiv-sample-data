Let R be a compact, connected, orientable surface of genus g, Mod_R^* be the extended mapping class group of R, \mathcal{C}(R) be the complex of curves on R, and \mathcal{N}(R) be the complex of nonseparating curves on R. We prove that if g \geq 2 and R has at most g-1 boundary components, then a simplicial map \lambda: \mathcal{N}(R) \to \mathcal{N}(R) is superinjective if and only if it is induced by a homeomorphism of R. We prove that if g \geq 2 and R is not a closed surface of genus two then Aut(\mathcal{N}(R))= Mod_R^*, and if R is a closed surface of genus two then Aut(\mathcal{N}(R))= Mod_R ^* /\mathcal{C}(Mod_R^*). We also prove that if g=2 and R has at most one boundary component, then a simplicial map \lambda: \mathcal{C}(R) \to \mathcal{C}(R) is superinjective if and only if it is induced by a homeomorphism of R. As a corollary we prove some new results about injective homomorphisms from finite index subgroups to Mod_R^*. The last two results complete the author's previous results to connected orientable surfaces of genus at least two.
