The Witten-Reshetikhin-Turaev invariant of classical link diagrams is generalized to virtual link diagrams. This invariant is unchanged by the framed Reidemeister moves and the Kirby calculus. As a result, it is also an invariant of the 3-manifolds represented by the classical link diagrams. This generalization is used to demonstrate that there are virtual knot diagrams with a non-trivial Witten-Reshetikhin-Turaev invariant and trivial 3-manifold fundamental group.
