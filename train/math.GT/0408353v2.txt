Among (isotopy classes of) automorphisms of handlebodies those called irreducible (or generic) are the most interesting, analogues of pseudo-Anosov automorphisms of surfaces. We consider the problem of isotoping an irreducible automorphism so that it is most efficient (has minimal growth rate) in its isotopy class. We describe a property, called tightness, of certain invariant laminations, which we conjecture characterizes this efficiency. We obtain partial results towards proving the conjecture. For example, we prove it for genus two handlebodies. We also show that tightness always implies efficiency. In addition, partly in order to provide counterexamples in our study of properties of invariant laminations, we develop a method for generating a class of irreducible automorphisms of handlebodies.
