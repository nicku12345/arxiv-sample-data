For X = R, C, or H it is well known that cusp cross-sections of finite volume X-hyperbolic (n+1)-orbifolds are flat n-orbifolds or almost flat orbifolds modelled on the (2n+1)-dimensional Heisenberg group N_{2n+1} or the (4n+3)-dimensional quaternionic Heisenberg group N_{4n+3}(H). We give a necessary and sufficient condition for such manifolds to be diffeomorphic to a cusp cross-section of an arithmetic X-hyperbolic (n+1)-orbifold. A principal tool in the proof of this classification theorem is a subgroup separability result which may be of independent interest.
