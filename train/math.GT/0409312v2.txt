This paper investigates the relationship between the topology of hyperbolizable 3-manifolds M with incompressible boundary and the volume of hyperbolic convex cores homotopy equivalent to M. Specifically, it proves a conjecture of Bonahon stating that the volume of a convex core is at least half the simplicial volume of the doubled manifold DM, and this inequality is sharp. This paper proves that the inequality is in fact sharp in every pleating variety of AH(M).
