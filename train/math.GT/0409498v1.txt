In this paper, we shall prove that any Heegaard splitting of a \partial-reducible 3-manifold M, say M=W\cup V, can be obtained by doing connected sums, boundary connected sums and self-boundary connected sums from Heegaard splittings of n manifolds M_{1},..., M_{n} where M_{i} is either a solid torus or a \partial-irreducible manifold. Furthermore, W\cup V is stabilized if and only if one of the factors is stabilized.
