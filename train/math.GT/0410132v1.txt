Veech groups uniformize Teichm\"uller geodesic curves in Riemann moduli space. Recently, examples of infinitely generated Veech groups have been given. We show that these can even have infinitely many cusps and infinitely many infinite ends. We further show that examples exist for which each direction of an infinite end is the limit of directions of inequivalent infinite ends.
