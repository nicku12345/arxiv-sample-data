Following on from work of Dunfield, we determine the fibred status of all the unknown hyperbolic 3-manifolds in the cusped census. We then find all the fibred hyperbolic 3-manifolds in the closed census and use this to find over 100 examples each of closed and cusped virtually fibred non-fibred census 3-manifolds, including the Weeks manifold. We also show that the co-rank of the fundamental group of every 3-manifold in the cusped and in the closed census is 0 or 1.
