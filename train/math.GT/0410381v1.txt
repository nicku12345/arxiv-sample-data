We supply a proof of the fact that a hyperbolic 3-manifold M with finitely generated fundamental group and with no parabolics is topologically tame. This proves the Marden's conjecture. Our approach is to form an exhaustion M_i of M and modify the boundary to make them 2-convex. We use the induced path-metric, which makes the submanifold M_i \delta-hyperbolic and with Margulis constants independent of i. By taking the convex hull in the cover of M_i corresponding the core, we show that there exists an exiting sequence of surfaces \Sigma_i. We drill out the covers of M_i by a core C again to make it \delta-hyperbolic. Then the boundary of the convex hull of \Sigma_i is shown to meet the core. By the compactness argument of Souto, we show that infinitely many of \Sigma_i are homotopic in M - C^o.
