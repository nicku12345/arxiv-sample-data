This is an introduction to the construction of higher-dimensional knots by spinning methods. Simple spinning of classical knots was introduced by E. Artin in 1926, and several generalizations have followed. These include twist spinning, superspinning or p-spinning, frame spinning, roll spinning, and deform spinning. We survey these constructions and some of their most important applications, as well as some newer hybrids due to the author. The exposition, meant to be accessible to a broad audience, emphasizes a geometric approach to visualizing these constructions.
