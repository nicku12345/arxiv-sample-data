A knot in the 3-sphere is called doubly slice if it is a slice of an unknotted 2-sphere in the 4-sphere. We give a bi-sequence of new obstructions for a knot being doubly slice. We construct it following the idea of Cochran-Orr-Teichner's filtration of the classical knot concordance group. This yields a bi-filtration of the monoid of knots (under the connected sum operation) indexed by pairs of half integers. Doubly slice knots lie in the intersection of this bi-filtration. We construct examples of knots which illustrate non-triviality of this bi-filtration at all levels. In particular, these are new examples of algebraically doubly slice knots that are not doubly slice, and many of these knots are slice. Cheeger-Gromov's von Neumann rho invariants play a key role to show non-triviality of this bi-filtration. We also show that some classical invariants are reflected at the initial levels of this bi-filtration, and obtain a bi-filtration of the double concordance group.
