The definition of the grafting operation for quasifuchsian groups is extended by Bromberg to all b-groups. Although the grafting maps are not necessarily continuous at boundary groups, in this paper, we show that the grafting maps take every "standard" convergent sequence to a convergent sequence. As a consequence of this result, we extend Goldman's grafting theorem for quasifuchsian groups to all boundary b-groups.
