It has been known that any Alexander polynomial of a knot can be realized by a quasipositive knot. As a consequence, the Alexander polynomial cannot detect quasipositivity. In this paper we prove a similar result about Vassiliev invariants: for any oriented knot K and any natural number n there exists a quasipositive knot Q whose Vassiliev invariants of order less than or equal to n coincide with those of K.
