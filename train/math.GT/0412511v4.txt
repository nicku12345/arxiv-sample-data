We show that only finitely many links in a closed 3-manifold share the same complement, up to twists along discs and annuli. Using the same techniques, we prove that by adding 2-handles on the same link we get only finitely many smooth cobordisms between two given closed 3-manifolds.   As a consequence, there are finitely many smooth closed 4-manifolds constructed from some Kirby diagram with bounded number of crossings, discs, and strands, or from some Turaev special shadow with bounded number of vertices. (These are the 4-dimensional analogues of Heegaard diagrams and special spines for 3-manifolds.) We therefore get two filtrations on the set of all smooth closed 4-manifolds with finite sets. The two filtrations are equivalent after linear rescalings, and their cardinality grows at least as n^{c*n}.
