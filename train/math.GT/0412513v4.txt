If the twist numbers of a collection of oriented alternating link diagrams are bounded, then the Alexander polynomials of the corresponding links have bounded euclidean Mahler measure (see Definition 1.2). The converse assertion does not hold. Similarly, if a collection of oriented link diagrams, not necessarily alternating, have bounded twist numbers, then both the Jones polynomials and a parametrization of the 2-variable Homflypt polynomials of the corresponding links have bounded Mahler measure.
