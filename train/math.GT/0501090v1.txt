This article surveys our ongoing project about the relationship between invariants extending the classical Rohlin invariant of homology spheres and those coming from 4-dimensional (Yang-Mills) gauge theory. The main conjecture towards which this project is directed is that the Rohlin invariant and the gauge theoretic invariant coincide for a homology S^1\times S^3. We discuss the implications of this conjecture for some classical problems in low-dimensional topology, and progress we have made towards proving the conjecture.
