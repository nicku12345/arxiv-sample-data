Skeleta and other pure subsets of manifold stratified spaces are shown to have neighborhoods which are teardrops of stratified approximate fibrations (under dimension and compactness assumptions). In general, the stratified approximate fibrations cannot be replaced by bundles, and the teardrops cannot be replaced by mapping cylinder neighborhoods. Thus, this is the best possible topological tubular neighborhood theorem in the stratified setting.
