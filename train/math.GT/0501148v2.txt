For a hyperbolic 3-manifold M with a torus boundary component, all but finitely many Dehn fillings on the torus component yield hyperbolic 3-manifolds. In this paper, we will focus on the situation where M has two exceptional Dehn fillings, both of which yield toroidal manifolds. For such situation, Gordon gave an upper bound for the distance between two slopes of Dehn fillings. In particular, if M is large, then the distance is at most 5. We show that this upper bound can be improved by 1 for a broad class of large manifolds.
