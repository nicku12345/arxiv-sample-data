Positive Dehn twist products for some elements of finite order in the mapping class group of a 2-dimensional closed, compact, oriented surface \Sigma_g, which are rotations of \Sigma_g through 2\pi /p, are presented. The homeomorphism invariants of the resulting simply connected symplectic 4- manifolds are computed.
