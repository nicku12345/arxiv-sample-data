We consider a class of topological objects in the 3-sphere S^3 which will be called {\it n-punctured ball tangles}. Using the Kauffman bracket at A=e^{\pi i/4}, an invariant for a special type of n-punctured ball tangles is defined. The invariant F takes values in PM_{2\times2^n}(\mathbb Z), that is the set of 2\times 2^n matrices over \mathbb Z modulo the scalar multiplication of \pm1. This invariant leads to a generalization of a theorem of D. Krebes which gives a necessary condition for a given collection of tangles to be embedded in a link in S^3 disjointly. We also address the question of whether the invariant F is surjective onto PM_{2\times2^n}(\mathbb Z). We will show that the invariant F is surjective when n=0. When n=1, n-punctured ball tangles will also be called spherical tangles. We show that \text{det} F(S)=0 or 1 {\rm mod} 4 for every spherical tangle S. Thus F is not surjective when n=1.
