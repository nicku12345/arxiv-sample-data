It is well known that certain combinations of configuration space integrals defined by Bott and Taubes produce cohomology classes of spaces of knots. The literature surrounding this important fact, however, is somewhat incomplete and lacking in detail. The aim of this paper is to fill in the gaps as well as summarize the importance of these integrals.
