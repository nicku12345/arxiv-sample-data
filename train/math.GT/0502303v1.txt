We construct two infinite families of knots each of which admits a Seifert fibered surgery with none of these surgeries coming from Dean's primitive/Seifert-fibered construction. This disproves a conjecture that all Seifert fibered surgeries arise from Dean's primitive/Seifert-fibered construction. The (-3,3,5)-pretzel knot belongs to both of the infinite families.
