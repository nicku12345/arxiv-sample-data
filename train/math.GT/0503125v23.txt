This paper, to be regularly updated, lists those prime knots with the fewest possible number of crossings for which values of basic knot invariants, such as the unknotting number or the smooth 4-genus, are unknown. This list is being developed in conjunction with "KnotInfo" (www.indiana.edu/~knotinfo), a web-based table of knot invariants.
