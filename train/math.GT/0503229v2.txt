We prove that if K_1 \subset M_1,...,K_n \subset M_n are m-small knots in closed orientable 3-manifolds then the Heegaard genus of E(#_{i=1}^n K_i) is strictly less than the sum of the Heegaard genera of the E(K_i) (i=1,...,n) if and only if there exists a proper subset I of \{1,...,n\} so that #_{i \in I} K_i admits a primitive meridian. This generalizes the main result of Morimoto in \cite{morimoto1}.
