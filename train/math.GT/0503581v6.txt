Let N^h be a hyperbolic 3-manifold of bounded geometry corresponding to a hyperbolic structure on a pared manifold (M,P). Further, suppose that (\partial{M} - P) is incompressible, i.e. the boundary of M is incompressible away from cusps. Further, suppose that M_{gf} is a geometrically finite hyperbolic structure on (M,P). Then there is a Cannon- Thurston map from the limit set of M_{gf} to that of N^h. Further, the limit set of N^h is locally connected. This answers in part a question attributed to Thurston.
