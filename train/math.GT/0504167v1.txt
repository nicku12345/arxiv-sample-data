These notes grew out of a lecture series given at RIMS in the summer of 2001. The lecture series was aimed at a broad audience that included many graduate students. Its purpose lay in familiarizing the audience with the basics of 3-manifold theory and introducing some topics of current research. The first portion of the lecture series was devoted to standard topics in the theory of 3-manifolds. The middle portion was devoted to a brief study of Heegaaard splittings and generalized Heegaard splittings. The latter portion touched on a brand new topic: fork complexes.
