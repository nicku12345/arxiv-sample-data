A standard fact about two incompressible surfaces in an irreducible 3-manifold is that one can move one of them by isotopy so that their intersection becomes \pi_1-injective. By extending it on the maps of some 3-dimensional \mathbb{Z}_n-manifolds into 4-manifolds, we prove that any homotopy equivalence of 4-dimensional graph-manifolds with reduced graph-structures is homotopic to a diffeomorphism preserving the structures.   Keywords: graph-manifold, \pi_1-injective \mathbb{Z}_n-submanifold.
