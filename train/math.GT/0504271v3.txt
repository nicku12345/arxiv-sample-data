We give a combinatorial criterion that implies both the non-strong relative hyperbolicity and the one-endedness of a finitely generated group. We use this to show that many important classes of groups do not admit a strong relatively hyperbolic group structure and have one end. Applications include surface mapping class groups, the Torelli group, (special) automorphism and outer automorphism groups of most free groups, and the three-dimensional Heisenberg group. Our final application is to Thompson's group F.
