The configuration space of the mechanism of a planar robot is studied. We consider a robot which has n arms such that each arm is of length 1+1 and has a rotational joint in the middle, and that the endpoint of the k-th arm is fixed to Re^{\frac{2(k-1)\pi}ni}. Generically, the configuration space is diffeomorphic to an orientable closed surface. Its genus is given by a topological way and a Morse theoretical way. The homeomorphism types of it when it is singular is also given.
