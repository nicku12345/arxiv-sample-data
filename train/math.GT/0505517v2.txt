We continue our study of ends non-compact manifolds. The over-arching aim is to provide an appropriate generalization of Siebenmann's famous collaring theorem that applies to manifolds having non-stable fundamental group systems at infinity. In this paper a primary goal is finally achieved; namely, a complete characterization of pseudo-collarability for manifolds of dimension at least 6.
