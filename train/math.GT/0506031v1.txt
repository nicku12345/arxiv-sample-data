Let S be a closed orientable surface with genus g\geq 2. For a sequence \s_i in the Teichm\"uller space of S, which converges to a projective measured lamination [\lam] in the Thurston boundary, we obtain a relation between \lam and the geometric limit of pants decompositions whose lengths are uniformly bounded by a Bers constant L. We also show that this bounded pants decomposition is related to the Gromov boundary of complex of curves.
