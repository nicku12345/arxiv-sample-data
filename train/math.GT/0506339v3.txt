The derived group of a permutation representation, introduced by R.H. Crowell, unites many notions of knot theory. We survey Crowell's construction, and offer new applications.   The twisted Alexander group of a knot is defined. Using it, we obtain twisted Alexander modules and polynomials. Also, we extend a well-known theorem of Neuwirth and Stallings giving necessary and sufficient conditions for a knot to be fibered.   Virtual Alexander polynomials provide obstructions for a virtual knot that must vanish if the knot has a diagram with an Alexander numbering. The extended group of a virtual knot is defined, and using it a more sensitive obstruction is obtained.
