We describe a class \mathcal{C} of punctured torus bundles such that, for each M \in \mathcal{C}, all but finitely many Dehn fillings on M are virtually Haken.   We show that \mathcal{C} contains infinitely many commensurability classes, and we give evidence that \mathcal{C} includes representatives of ``most'' commensurability classes of punctured torus bundles.   In particular, we define an integer-valued complexity function on monodromies f (essentially the length of the LR-factorization of f_* in PSL_2(\mathbb{Z})), and use a computer to show that if the monodromy of M has complexity at most 5, then   M is finitely covered by an element of \mathcal{C}.   If the monodromy has complexity at most 12, then, with at most 36 exceptions,   M is finitely covered by an element of \mathcal{C}.   We also give a method for computing ``algebraic boundary slopes'' in certain finite covers of punctured torus bundles.
