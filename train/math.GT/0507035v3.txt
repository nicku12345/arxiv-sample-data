In this paper we prove a Markov Theorem for virtual braids and for some analogs of this structure. The virtual braid group is the natural companion in the category of virtual knots, just as the Artin braid group is the natural companion to classical knots and links. In this paper we follow the L--move methods to prove the Virtual Markov Theorem. One benefit of this approach is a fully local algebraic formulation of the Theorem.
