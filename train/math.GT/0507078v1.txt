An orientation preserving diffeomorphism over a surface embedded in a 4-manifold is called extendable, if this diffeomorphism is a restriction of an orientation preserving diffeomorphism on this 4-manifold. In this paper, we investigate conditions for extendability of diffeomorphisms over surfaces in the complex projective plane.
