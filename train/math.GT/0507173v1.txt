The only finite nonabelian simple group acting on a homology 3-sphere - necessarily non-freely - is the dodecahedral group \Bbb A_5 \cong {\rm PSL}(2,5) (in analogy, the only finite perfect group acting freely on a homology 3-sphere is the binary dodecahedral group \Bbb A_5^* \cong {\rm SL}(2,5)). In the present paper we show that the only finite simple groups acting on a homology 4-sphere, and in particular on the 4-sphere, are the alternating or linear fractional groups groups \Bbb A_5 \cong {\rm PSL}(2,5) and \Bbb A_6 \cong {\rm PSL}(2,9). From this we deduce a short list of groups which contains all finite nonsolvable groups admitting an action on a homology 4-spheres.
