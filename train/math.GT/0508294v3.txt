We give examples of closed hyperbolic 3-manifolds with first Betti number 2 and 3 for which no sequence of finite abelian covering spaces increases the first Betti number. For 3-manifolds M with first Betti number 2 we give a characterization in terms of some generalized self-linking numbers of M, for there to exist a family of \mathbb{Z}_n covering spaces,   M_n, in which \beta_1(M_n) increases linearly with n.   The latter generalizes work of M. Katz and C. Lescop [KL], by showing that the non-vanishing of any one of these invariants of M is sufficient to guarantee certain optimal systolic inequalities for M (by work of Ivanov and Katz [IK]).
