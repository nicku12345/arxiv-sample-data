Algorithms are described and Maple implementations are provided for finding all quandles of order n, as well as computing all homomorphisms between two finite quandles or from a finitely presented quandle (e.g., a knot quandle) to a finite quandle, computing the automorphism group of a finite quandle, etc. Several of these programs work for arbitrary binary operation tables and hence algebraic structures other than quandles. We also include a stand-alone C program which finds quandles of order n and provide URLs for files containing the results for n=6, 7 and 8.
