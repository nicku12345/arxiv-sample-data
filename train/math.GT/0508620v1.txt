Two single parameter families of polyhedra P(\psi) are constructed in three dimensional spaces of constant curvature C(\psi). Identification of the faces of the polyhedra via isometries results in cone manifolds M(\psi) which are topologically S^1\timesS^2, S^3 or singular S^2. The singular set of M(\psi) can have self intersections for some values of \psi and can also be the Whitehead link or form other configurations. Curvature varies continuously with \psi. At \psi=0 spontaneous surgery occurs and the topological type of M(\psi) changes. This phenomenon is described.
