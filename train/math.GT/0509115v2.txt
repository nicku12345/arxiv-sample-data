When G is a connected compact Lie group, and \pi is a closed surface group, then Hom(\pi,G) contains an open dense Out(\pi)-invariant subset which is a smooth symplectic manifold. This symplectic structure is Out(\pi)-invariant and therefore defines an invariant measure \mu, which has finite volume. The corresponding unitary representation of Out(\pi) on L^2(Hom(\pi,G)/G,\mu) contains no finite-dimensional subrepresentations besides the constants. This note gives a short proof that when G=SU(n), the representation L^2(Hom(\pi,G)/G,\mu) contains many other invariant subspaces.
