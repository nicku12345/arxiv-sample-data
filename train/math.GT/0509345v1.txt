Through computer enumeration with the aid of topological results, we catalogue all 18 closed non-orientable P^2-irreducible 3-manifolds that can be formed from at most eight tetrahedra. In addition we give an overview as to how the 100 resulting minimal triangulations are constructed. Observations and conjectures are drawn from the census data, and future potential for the non-orientable census is discussed. Some preliminary nine-tetrahedron results are also included.
