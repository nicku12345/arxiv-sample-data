We study the causality relation in the 3-dimensional anti-de Sitter space AdS and its conformal boundary Ein. To any closed achronal subset \Lambda in {Ein}\_2 we associate the invisible domain E(\Lambda) from \Lambda in AdS. We show that if \Gamma is a torsion-free discrete group of isometries of AdS preserving \Lambda and is non-elementary (for example, not abelian) then the action of \Gamma on E(\Lambda) is free, properly discontinuous and strongly causal. If \Lambda is a topological circle then the quotient space M\_\Lambda(\Gamma) = \Gamma\backslash{E}(\Lambda) is a maximal globally hyperbolic AdS-spacetime admitting a Cauchy surface S such that the induced metric on S is complete. In a forthcoming paper we study the case where \Gamma is elementary and use the results of the present paper to define a large family of AdS-spacetimes including all the previously known examples of BTZ multi-black holes.
