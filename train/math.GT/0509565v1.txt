We find two bases for the lattices of the SU(2)-TQFT-theory modules of the torus over given rings of integers. We use variant of the bases defined in [GMW]for the lattices of the SO(3)-TQFT-theory modules of the torus. Moreover, we discuss the quantization functors (V_{p},Z_{p}) for p=1, and p=2. Then we give concrete bases for the lattices of the modules in the 2-theory. We use the above results to discuss the ideal invariant defined in [FK]. The ideal can be computed for all 3-manifolds using the 2-theory, and all 3-manifolds with torus boundary using the SU(2)-TQFT-theory. In fact, we show that this ideal in the SU(2)-TQFT-theory is contained in the product of the ideals in the 2-theory and the SO(3)-TQFT-theory under a certain change of cofficients, and it is equal in the case of a torus boundary.
