We show that the rational Novikov conjecture for a group   \Gamma of finite homological type follows from the mod 2   acyclicity of the Higson compactifcation of an E\Gamma. We then   show that for groups of finite asymptotic dimension the Higson   compactification is mod p acyclic for all p, and deduce the integral   Novikov conjecture for these groups.
