We give a complete description of conjugacy classes of finite subgroups of the mapping class group of the sphere with r marked points. As a corollary we obtain a description of conjugacy classes of maximal finite subgroups of the hyperelliptic mapping class group. In particular, we prove that for a fixed genus g there are at most five such classes.
