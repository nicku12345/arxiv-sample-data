We prove that both the hyperelliptic mapping class group and the extended hyperelliptic mapping class group are generated by two torsion elements. We also compute the index of the subgroup of the hyperelliptic mapping class group which is generated by involutions and we prove that the extended hyperelliptic mapping class group is generated by three orientation reversing involutions.
