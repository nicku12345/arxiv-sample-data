We estimate from below the number of lines meeting each of given 4 disjoint smooth closed curves in a given cyclic order in the real projective 3-space and in a given linear order in the Euclidean 3-space. Similarly, we estimate the number of circles meeting in a given cyclic order given 6 disjoint smooth closed curves in Euclidean 3-space. The estimations are formulated in terms of linking numbers of the curves and obtained by orienting of the corresponding configuration spaces and evaluating of their signatures. This involves a study of a surface swept by lines meeting 3 given disjoint smooth closed curves and a surface swept in the 3-space by circles meeting 5 given disjoint smooth closed curves. Higher dimensional generalizations of these results are outlined.
