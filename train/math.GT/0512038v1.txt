We determine all hyperbolic 3-manifolds M admitting two toroidal Dehn fillings at distance 4 or 5. We show that if M is a hyperbolic 3-manifold with a torus boundary component T_0, and r,s are two slopes on T_0 with \Delta(r,s) = 4 or 5 such that M(r) and M(s) both contain an essential torus, then M is either one of 14 specific manifolds M_i, or obtained from M_1, M_2, M_3 or M_{14} by attaching a solid torus to \partial M_i - T_0. All the manifolds M_i are hyperbolic, and we show that only the first three can be embedded into S^3. As a consequence, this leads to a complete classification of all hyperbolic knots in S^3 admitting two toroidal surgeries with distance at least 4.
