We have a knot quandle and a fundamental class as invariants for a surface-knot. These invariants can be defined for a classical knot in a similar way, and it is known that the pair of them is a complete invariant for classical knots. In this paper, we compare a situation in surface-knot theory with that in classical knot theory, and prove the following: There exist arbitrarily many inequivalent surface-knots of genus g with the same knot quandle, and there exist two inequivalent surface-knots of genus g with the same knot quandle and with the same fundamental class.
