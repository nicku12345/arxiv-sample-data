It is well-known:Suppose there are three 1-dimensional links K_+, K_-, K_0 such that K_+, K_-, and K_0 coincide out of a 3-ball B trivially embedded in S^3 and that K_+\cap B, K_-\cap B, and K_0\cap B are drawn as follows. Then \Delta_{K_+}-\Delta_{K_+}=(t-1)\cdot\Delta_{K_0}, where \Delta_{K} is the Alexander polynomial of K.   We know similar formulae of other invariants of 1-dimensional knots and links. (The Jones polynomial etc.)   It is natural to ask: Suppose there are two n-dimensional knots K_+, K_- and a submanifold K_0 such that K_+, K_-, and K_0 coincide out of a n-ball B trivially embedded in S^{n+2}. Then is there a relation in K_+\cap B, K_-\cap B, and K_0\cap B with the following property(*)? (*)If K_+, K_-, and K_0 satisfy this relation, an invariant of K_+, that of K_-, and that of K_0 satisfy a fixed relation.   In this paper we pove there are such a relation where K_+, K_-, and K_0 satisfy the formula \Delta_{K_+}-\Delta_{K_+}=(t-1)\cdot\Delta_{K_0}, where \Delta_{K} is a polynomial to represent the Alexander polynomial of K.   We show another relation where K_+, K_-, and K_0 satisfy the formula {\mathrm{Arf}}K_+-{\mathrm{Arf}}K_-=\{|bP_{4k+2}\cap I(K_0)|+1\}mod 2, where (1)I() is the inertia group. and I(K_0) is the inertia group of a smooth manifold which is orientation preserving diffeomorphic to K_0. (2)For a group G, |G| denote the order of G. A local move formula is a relation of an invariant of a few knots related by a local move as above.
