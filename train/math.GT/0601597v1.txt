We construct a small, hyperbolic 3-manifold M such that, for any integer g\geq 2, there are infinitely many separating slopes r in \partial M so that M(r), the 3-manifold obtained by attaching a 2-handle to M along r, is hyperbolic and contains an essential separating closed surface of genus g. The result contrasts sharply with those known finiteness results on Dehn filling, and it also contrasts sharply with the known finiteness result on handle addition for the cases g=0,1. Our 3-manifold M is the complement of a hyperbolic, small knot in a handlebody of genus 3.
