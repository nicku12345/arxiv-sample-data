The object of this paper is to define a subcategory of the category of 3-cobordisms to which invariants of rational homology 3-spheres should generalize. We specify the notion of Topological Quantum Field Theory (in the sense of Atiyah) to this case, and prove two interesting properties that these TQFTs always have. In the case of the LMO invariant these properties amount to saying that the TQFT is anomaly-free.
