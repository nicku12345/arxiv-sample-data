Using PL-methods, we prove the Marden's conjecture that a hyperbolic 3-manifold M with finitely generated fundamental group and with no parabolics are topologically tame. Our approach is to form an exhaustion M_i of M and modify the boundary to make them 2-convex. We use the induced path-metric, which makes the submanifold M_i negatively curved and with Margulis constant independent of i. By taking the convex hull in the cover of M_i corresponding to the core, we show that there exists an exiting sequence of surfaces \Sigma_i. Some of the ideas follow those of Agol. We drill out the covers of M_i by a core \core again to make it negatively curved. Then the boundary of the convex hull of \Sigma_i is shown to meet the core. By the compactness argument of Souto, we show that infinitely many of \Sigma_i are homotopic in M - \core^o. Our method should generalize to a more wider class of piecewise hyperbolic manifolds.
