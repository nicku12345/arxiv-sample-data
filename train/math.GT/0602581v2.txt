A Heegaard splitting of an open 3-manifold is the partition of the manifold into two non-compact handlebodies which intersect on their common boundary. This paper proves several non-compact analogues of theorems about compact Heegaard splittings. The main theorem is: if N is a compact, connected, orientable 3-manifold with non-empty boundary, containing no S^2 components, and if M is obtained from N by removing the boundary then any two Heegaard splittings of M are properly ambient isotopic. This is a non-compact analogue of the classifications of splittings of (closed surface) x I and (closed surface) x S^1 by Scharlemann-Thompson and Schultens. Work of Frohman-Meeks and a non-compact analogue of the Casson-Gordon theorem on weakly reducible Heegaard splittings are key tools.
