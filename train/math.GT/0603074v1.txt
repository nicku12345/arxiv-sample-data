Let P(S) be the space of projective structures on a closed surface S of genus g >1 and let Q(S) be the subset of P(S) of projective structures with quasifuchsian holonomy. It is known that Q(S) consists of infinitely many connected components. In this paper, we will show that the closure of any exotic component of Q(S) is not a topological manifold with boundary and that any two components of Q(S) have intersecting closures.
