For a surface F, the Kauffman bracket skein module of F \times [0,1], denoted K(F), admits a natural multiplication which makes it an algebra. When specialized at a complex number t, nonzero and not a root of unity, we have K_t(F), a vector space over \mathbb{C}. In this paper, we will use the product-to-sum formula of Frohman and Gelca to show that the vector space K_t(T^2) has five distinct traces. One trace, the Yang-Mills measure, is obtained by picking off the coefficient of the empty skein. The other four traces on K_t(T^2) correspond to each of the four \mathbb{Z}_2 homology classes of the torus.
