Ozsvath and Szabo conjectured that knot Floer homology detects fibred knots. We propose a strategy to approach this conjecture based on Gabai's theory of sutured manifold decomposition and contact topology. We implement this strategy for genus-one knots, obtaining as a corollary that, if rational surgery on a knot K gives the Poincare homology sphere \Sigma(2,3,5), then K is the left-handed trefoil knot.
