We investigate the problem of describing the homotopy classes [X,Y] of continuous functions between \omega-bounded non metrizable manifolds X,Y. We define a family of surfaces X built with the first octant C in L^2 (L is the longline and R the longray), and show that [X,R] is in bijection with so called `adapted' subsets of a partially ordered set. We also show that [M,R] can be computed for some surfaces M that, unlike C, do not contain R. This indicates that when X,Y are \omega-bounded non metrizable surfaces, there might be a link between [X,Y] and the concept of Y-directions in X. Many pictures are used and the proofs are quite detailed.
