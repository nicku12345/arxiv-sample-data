Suppose a genus two handlebody is removed from a 3-manifold M and then a single meridian of the handlebody is restored. The result is a knot or link complement in M and it is natural to ask whether geometric properties of the link complement say something about the meridian that was restored. Here we consider what the relation must be between two not necessarily disjoint meridians so that restoring each of them gives a trivial knot or a split link.
