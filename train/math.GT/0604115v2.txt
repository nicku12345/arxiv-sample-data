Let T be a separating incompressible torus in a 3-manifold M. Assuming that a genus g Heegaard splitting V \cup_S W can be positioned nicely with respect to T (e.g. V \cup_S W is strongly irreducible), we obtain an upper bound on the number of stabilizations required for V \cup_S W to become isotopic to a Heegaard splitting which is an amalgamation along T. In particular, if T is a canonical torus in the JSJ decomposition of M, then the number of necessary stabilizations is at most 4g-4. As a corollary, this establishes an upper bound on the number of stabilizations required for V \cup_S W and any Heegaard splitting obtained by a Dehn twist of V \cup_S W along T to become isotopic.
