For two measured laminations \nu^+ and \nu^- that fill up a hyperbolizable surface S and for t \in (-\infty, \infty), let L_t be the unique hyperbolic surface that minimizes the length function e^t l(\nu^+) + e^{-t} l(\nu^-) on Teichmuller space. We characterize the curves that are short in L_t and estimate their lengths. We find that the short curves coincide with the curves that are short in the surface G_t on the Teichmuller geodesic whose horizontal and vertical foliations are respectively, e^t \nu^+ and e^{-t} \nu^-. By deriving additional information about the twists of \nu^+ and \nu^- around the short curves, we estimate the Teichmuller distance between L_t and G_t. We deduce that this distance can be arbitrarily large, but that if S is a once-punctured torus or four-times-punctured sphere, the distance is bounded independently of t.
