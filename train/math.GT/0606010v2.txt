For a local system on a compact hyperbolic threefold, under a cohomological assumption, we will show that the order of its twisted Alexander polynomial and of the Ruelle L function at s=0 coincide. Moreover we will show that their leading constant are also identical. These results may be considered as a solution of a geomeric analogue of the Iwasawa conjecture in the algebraic number theory.
