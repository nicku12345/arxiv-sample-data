We prove that an integral homology 3-sphere is S^3 if and only if it admits four periodic diffeomorphisms of odd prime orders whose space of orbits is S^3. As an application we show that an irreducible integral homology sphere which is not S^3 is the cyclic branched cover of odd prime order of at most four knots in S^3. A result on the structure of finite groups of odd order acting on integral homology spheres is also obtained.
