Using an involved study of the Jones polynomial, we determine, as our main result, the crossing numbers of (prime) amphicheiral knots. As further applications, we show that several classes of links, including semiadequate links and Whitehead doubles of semiadequate knots, have non-trivial Jones polynomial. We also prove that there are infinitely many positive knots with no positive minimal crossing diagrams. Some relations to the twist number of a link, Mahler measure and the hyperbolic volume are given, for example explicit upper bounds on the volume for Montesinos and 3-braid links in terms of their Jones polynomial.
