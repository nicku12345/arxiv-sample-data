The present paper follows the computational approach to 3-manifold classification via edge-coloured graphs, already performed by several authors with respect to orientable 3-manifolds up to 28 coloured tetrahedra, non-orientable 3-manifolds up to 26 coloured tetrahedra, genus two 3-manifolds up to 34 coloured tetrahedra: in fact, by automatic generation and analysis of suitable edge-coloured graphs, called crystallizations, we obtain a catalogue of all orientable 3-manifolds admitting coloured triangulations with 30 tetrahedra. These manifolds are unambiguously identified via JSJ decompositions and fibering structures. It is worth noting that, in the present work, a suitable use of elementary combinatorial moves yields an automatic partition of the elements of the generated crystallization catalogue into equivalence classes, which are proved to be in one-to one correspondence with the homeomorphism classes of the represented manifolds.
