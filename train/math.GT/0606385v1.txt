We show that the group of all pl-homeomorphisms of the reals having bounded slopes surjects on the group QI({\Bbb R}) of all quasi-isometries of {\Bbb R}. We prove that the following groups can be imbedded in QI({\Bbb R}): The group of compactly supported pl-homeomorphisms of the reals, the Richard Thompson group F, and the free group of rank the continuum.
