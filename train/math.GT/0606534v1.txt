For sutured 3-manifolds M, there is a sutured Thurston norm due to Scharlemann. We show how depth one foliations of M and corresponding fibrations and the usual Thurston norm on the double of M are useful tools for computing this norm. In many examples, the faces of the unit ball of the sutured norm are related to cones of depth one foliations of M but examples indicate this is not a general relationship.
