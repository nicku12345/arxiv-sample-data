We show that the nonzero roots of the torsion polynomials associated to the infinite cyclic covers of a given compact, connected, orientable 3-manifold M are contained in a compact part of the complex plane a priori determined by M. This result is applied to prove that when M is closed, it dominates at most finitely many Sol manifolds.
