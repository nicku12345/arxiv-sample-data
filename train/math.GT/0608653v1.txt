For a given polyhedron K\subset M the notation R_M(K) denotes a regular neighborhood of K in M. We study the following problem: find all pairs (m,k) such that if K is a compact k-polyhedron and M a PL m-manifold, then R_M(fK)\cong R_M(gK), for each two homotopic PL embeddings f,g:K\to M. We prove that R_{S^{k+2}}(S^k)\not\cong S^k\times D^2 for each k\ge2 and {\it some} PL sphere S^k\subset S^{k+2} (even for {\it any} PL sphere S^k\subset S^{k+2} having an isolated non-locally flat point with the singularity S^{k-1}\subset S^{k+1} such that \pi_1(S^{k+1}-S^{k-1})\not\cong\Z).
