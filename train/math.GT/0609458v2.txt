Bing doubling is an operation which produces a 2-component boundary link B(K) from a knot K. If K is slice, then B(K) is easily seen to be boundary slice. In this paper, we investigate whether the converse holds. Our main result is that if B(K) is boundary slice, then K is algebraically slice. We also show that the Rasmussen invariant can tell that certain Bing doubles are not smoothly slice.
