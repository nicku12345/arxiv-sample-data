In this paper we clarify the relationship between ribbon surfaces of Legendrian graphs and quasipositive diagrams by using certain fence diagrams. As an application, we give an alternative proof of a theorem concerning a relationship between quasipositive fiber surfaces and contact structures on the 3-sphere. We also answer a question of L. Rudolph concerning moves of quasipositive diagrams.
