Our aim is to prove that two formal power series of importance to quantum topology are Gevrey. These series are the Kashaev invariant of a knot (reformulated by Huynh and the second author) and the Gromov norm of the LMO of an integral homology 3-sphere. It follows that the power series associated to a simple Lie algebra and a homology sphere is Gevrey. Contrary to the case of analysis, our formal power series are not solutions to differential equations with polynomial coefficients. The first author has conjectured (and in some cases proved, in joint work with Costin) that our formal power series have resurgent Borel transform, with geometrically interesting set of singularities.
