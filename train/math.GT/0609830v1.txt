Let M be a simple 3-manifold such that one component of \partial M, say F, has genus at least two. For a slope \alpha on F, we denote by M(\alpha) the manifold obtained by attaching a 2-handle to M along a regular neighborhood of \alpha on F. If M(\alpha) is reducible, then \alpha is called a reducing slope. In this paper, we shall prove that the distance between two separating, reducing slopes on F is at most 4.
