Using a combinatorial approach described in a recent paper of Manolescu, Ozsv\'ath, and Sarkar we compute the Heegaard-Floer knot homology of all knots with at most 12 crossings as well as the \tau invariant for knots through 11 crossings. We review the basic construction of \cite{MOS}, giving two examples that can be worked out by hand, and explain some ideas we used to simplify the computation. We conclude with a discussion of knot Floer homology for small knots, closely examining the Kinoshita-Teraska knot KT_{2,1} and its Conway mutant.
