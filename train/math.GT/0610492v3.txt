For an n-component link L, the Milnor's isotopy invariant is defined for each multi-index I=i_1i_2...i_m (i_j\in\n). Here m is called the length. Let r(I) denote the maximam number of times that any index appears. It is known that Milnor invariants with r=1 are link-homotopy invariant. N. Habegger and X. S. Lin showed that two string links are a link-homotopc if and only if their Milnor invariants with r=1 coincide. This gives us that a link in S^3 is link-homotopic to a trivial link if and only if the all Milnor invariants of the link with r=1 vanish. Although Milnor invariants with r=2 are not link-homotopy invariants, T. Fleming and the author showed that Milnor invariants with r\leq 2 are self \Delta-equivalence invariants. In this paper, we give a self \Delta-equivalence classification of the set of n-component links in S^3 whose Milnor invariants with length \leq 2n-1 and r\leq 2 vanish. As a corollary, we have that a link is self \Delta-equivalent to a trivial link if and only if the all Milnor invariants of the link with r\leq 2 vanish. This is a geometric characterization for links whose Milnor invariants with \leq 2 vanish. The chief ingredient in our proof is Habiro's clasper theory. We also give an alternate proof of a link-homotopy classification of string links by using clasper theory.
