Let X be a connected compact 3-manifold with non-empty boundary. Consider the boundary M of X\times D^2. M is a 4-dimensional closed manifold and has the same fundamental group as X. Various examples of X are known for which a certain assembly map A:H_4(X;L)\to L_4(\pi_1(X)) is injective. For such an X and any CW-spine B of X, there is a UV^1-map p:M\to B. For any \epsilon>0, if the surgery obstruction for a TOP normal map (f,b):N\to M vanishes, we can perform surgery on f to change it into a p^{-1}(\epsilon)-controlled homotopy equivalence.
