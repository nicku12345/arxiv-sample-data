Let K= K(w,b,t) be a 1-bridge braid in a solid torus V, and let \gamma be a (p,q) curve on the torus T = \partial V of the exterior M_K of K. It will be shown that Dehn filling on T along \gamma produces a solid torus if and only if p and q satisfy one of four conditions determined by the parameters (w,b,t) of the knot K. This solves the classification problem raised by Menasco and Zhang for such Dehn fillings.
