We notice that a generic nonsingular gradient field v = \nabla f on a compact 3-fold X with boundary canonically generates a simple spine K(f, v) of X. We study the transformations of K(f, v) that are induced by deformations of the data (f, v). We link the Matveev complexity c(X) of X with counting the \emph{double-tangent} trajectories of the v-flow, i.e. the trajectories that are tangent to the boundary \d X at a pair of distinct points. Let gc(X) be the minimum number of such trajectories, minimum being taken over all nonsingular v's. We call gc(X) the \emph{gradient complexity} of X. Next, we prove that there are only finitely many X of bounded gradient complexity, provided that X is irreducible and boundary irreducible with no essential annuli. In particular, there exists only finitely many hyperbolic manifolds X with bounded gc(X). For such X, their normalized hyperbolic volume gives an upper bound of gc(X). If an irreducible and boundary irreducible X with no essential annuli admits a nonsingular gradient flow with no double-tangent trajectories, then X is a standard ball. All these and many other results of the paper rely on a careful study of the stratified geometry of \d X relative to the v-flow. It is characterized by failure of \d X to be \emph{convex} with respect to a generic flow v. It turns out, that convexity or its lack have profound influence on the topology of X. This interplay between intrinsic concavity of \d X with respect to any gradient-like flow and complexity of X is in the focus of the paper.
