In this article, we present new symplectic 4-manifolds with same integral cohomology as S^{2}\times S^{2}. The generalization of this construction is given as well, an infinite family of symplectic 4-manifolds cohomology equivalent to #_{(2g-1)}{(S^{2}\times S^{2})} for any g\geq 2. We also compute the Seiberg-Witten invariants of these manifolds.
