We study codimension one smooth foliations with Morse type singularities on closed ma-nifolds. We obtain a description of the manifold in case the number of centers in greater then the number of saddles. This result relies on and extends previous results of Reeb (for foliations having only centers) and Ells-Kuiper (for manifolds admitting Morse functions with three singularities).
