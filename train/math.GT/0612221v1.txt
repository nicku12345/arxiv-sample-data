In \cite{rigidity}, Luo introduced a \psi_{\lambda} edge invariant which turns out to be a coordinate of the Teichm\"uller space of a surface with boundary. And he proved that for \lambda \geq 0, the image of the Teichm\"uller space under \psi_{\lambda} edge invariant coordinate is an open cell. In this paper we verify his conjecture that for \lambda<0, the image of the Teichm\"uller space is a bounded convex polytope.
