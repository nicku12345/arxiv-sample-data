We reconsider the su(3) link homology theory defined by Khovanov in math.QA/0304375 and generalized by Mackaay and Vaz in math.GT/0603307. With some slight modifications, we describe the theory as a map from the planar algebra of tangles to a planar algebra of (complexes of) `cobordisms with seams' (actually, a `canopolis'), making it local in the sense of Bar-Natan's local su(2) theory of math.GT/0410495.   We show that this `seamed cobordism canopolis' decategorifies to give precisely what you'd both hope for and expect: Kuperberg's su(3) spider defined in q-alg/9712003. We conjecture an answer to an even more interesting question about the decategorification of the Karoubi envelope of our cobordism theory.   Finally, we describe how the theory is actually completely computable, and give a detailed calculation of the su(3) homology of the (2,n) torus knots.
