In this paper we use character variety methods to study homomorphisms between the fundamental groups of 3-manifolds, in particular those induced by non-zero degree maps. A {\it knot manifold} is a compact, connected, irreducible, orientable 3-manifold whose boundary is an incompressible torus. A {\it virtual epimorphism} is a homomorphism whose image is of finite index in its range. We show that the existence of such homomorphisms places constraints on the algebraic decomposition of a knot manifold's PSL_2(\mathbb C)-character variety and consequently determine a priori bounds on the number of virtual epimorphisms between the fundamental groups of small knot manifolds with a fixed domain. In the second part of the paper we fix a small knot manifold M and investigate various sets of characters of representations with discrete image in PSL_2(\mathbb C). The topology of these sets is intimately related to the algebraic structure of the PSL_2(\mathbb C)-character variety of M as well as dominations of manifolds by M and its Dehn fillings. In particular, we apply our results to study families of non-zero degree maps f_n: M(\alpha_n) \to V_n where M(\alpha_n) is the \alpha_n-Dehn filling of M and V_n is either a hyperbolic manifold or \widetilde{SL_2} manifold. We show that quite often, up to taking a subsequence, there is a knot manifold V, slopes \beta_j on \partial V such that V_j \cong V(\beta_j), and a non-zero degree map M \to V which induces f_j up to homotopy. The work of the first part of the paper is then applied to construct infinite families of small, closed, connected, orientable 3-manifolds which do not admit non-zero degree maps, other than homeomorphisms, to any hyperbolic manifold, or even manifolds with infinite fundamental groups.
