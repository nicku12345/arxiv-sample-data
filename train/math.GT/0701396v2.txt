We give another proof of a theorem of Scharlemann and Tomova and of a theorem of Hartshorn. The two theorems together say the following. Let M be a compact orientable irreducible 3--manifold and P a Heegaard surface of M. Suppose Q is either an incompressible surface or a strongly irreducible Heegaard surface in M. Then either the Hempel distance d(P) <= 2 genus(Q) or P is isotopic to Q. This theorem can be naturally extended to bicompressible but weakly incompressible surfaces.
