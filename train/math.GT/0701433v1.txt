A generic smooth map of a closed 2k-manifold into (3k-1)-space has a finite number of cusps (\Sigma^{1,1}-singularities). We determine the possible numbers of cusps of such maps. A fold map is a map with singular set consisting of only fold singularities (\Sigma^{1,0}-singularities). Two fold maps are fold bordant if there are cobordisms between their source- and target manifolds with a fold map extending the two maps between the boundaries, if the two targets agree and the target cobordism can be taken as a product with a unit interval then the maps are fold cobordant. We compute the cobordism groups of fold maps of (2k-1)-manifolds into (3k-2)-space. Analogous cobordism semi-groups for arbitrary closed (3k-2)-dimensional target manifolds are endowed with Abelian group structures and described. Fold bordism groups in the same dimensions are described as well.
