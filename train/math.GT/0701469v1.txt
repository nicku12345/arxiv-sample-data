We construct an invariant for non-spin 4-manifolds by using 2-torsion cohomology classes of moduli spaces of instantons on SO(3)-bundles. The invariant is an SO(3)-version of Fintushel-Stern's 2-torsion instanton invariant. We show that this SO(3)-torsion invariant is non-trivial for 2CP^2 # -CP^2, while it is known that any known invariant of 2CP^2 # -CP^2 coming from the Seiberg-Witten theory is trivial since 2CP^2 # -CP^2 has a positive scalar curvature metric.
