From a pseudo-triangulation with n tetrahedra T of an arbitrary closed orientable connected 3-manifold (for short, {\em a 3D-space}) M^3, we present a gem J ', inducing \IS^3, with the following characteristics: (a) its number of vertices is O(n); (b) it has a set of p pairwise disjoint couples of vertices \{u_i,v_i\}, each named {\em a twistor}; (c) in the dual (J ')^\star of J ' a twistor becomes a pair of tetrahedra with an opposite pair of edges in common, and it is named {\em a hinge}; (d) in any embedding of (J ')^\star \subset \IS^3, the \epsilon-neighborhood of each hinge is a solid torus; (e) these p solid tori are pairwise disjoint; (f) each twistor contains the precise description on how to perform a specific surgery based in a Denh-Lickorish twist on the solid torus corresponding to it; (g) performing all these p surgeries (at the level of the dual gems) we produce a gem G ' with |G '|=M^3; (h) in G ' each such surgery is accomplished by the interchange of a pair of neighbors in each pair of vertices: in particular, |V(G ')=|V(J ')|.   This is a new proof, {\em based on a linear polynomial algorithm}, of the classical Theorem of Wallace (1960) and Lickorish (1962) that every 3D-space has a framed link presentation in \IS^3 and opens the way for an algorithmic method to actually obtaining the link by an O(n^2)-algorithm. This is the subject of a companion paper soon to be released.
