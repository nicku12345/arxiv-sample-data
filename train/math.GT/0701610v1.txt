We apply Donaldson's theorem on the intersection forms of definite 4--manifolds to characterize the lens spaces which smoothly bound rational homology 4--dimensional balls. Our result implies, in particular, that every smoothly slice 2--bridge knot is ribbon, proving the ribbon conjecture for 2--bridge knots.
