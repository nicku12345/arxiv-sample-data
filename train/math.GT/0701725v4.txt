In earlier work, we had shown that Cannon-Thurston maps exist for Kleinian surface groups. In this paper we prove that pre-images of points are precisely end-points of leaves of the ending lamination whenever the Cannon-Thurston map is not one-to-one. In particular, the Cannon-Thurston map is finite-to-one. This completes the proof of the conjectural picture of Cannon-Thurston maps for surface groups.
