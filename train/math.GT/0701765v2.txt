Given integers g_i > 1 (i=1,...,n) we prove that there exist infinitely may knots K_i in S^3 so that g(E(K_i)) = g_i and the Heegaard genus of the exterior of the connected sum of K_1,...,K_n is the sum the Heegaard genera of K_1,...,K_n, that is: g(E(K_1#...#K_n)) = g(E(K_1)) +...+ g(E(K_n)). (Here, E() denotes the exterior and g() the Heegaard genus.) Together with Theorem 1.5 of [1], this proves the existence of counterexamples to Morimoto's Conjecture (Conjecture 1.5 of [2]).
