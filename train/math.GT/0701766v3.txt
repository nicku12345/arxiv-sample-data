We show that there exist knots K in S^3 with g(E(K))=2 and g(E(K#K#K))=6. Together with Theorem~1.5 of [1], this proves existence of counterexamples to Morimoto's Conjecture (Conjecture 1.5 of [2]). This is a special case of arxiv.org/abs/math.GT/0701765   [1] Tsuyoshi Kobayashi and Yo'av Rieck. On the growth rate of the tunnel number of knots. J. Reine Angew. Math., 592:63--78, 2006.
