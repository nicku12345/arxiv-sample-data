This paper has been withdrawn by the author, as the proof of Theorem 3.2 contains a flaw; subsequently, both it and Theorem 3.3 are not known to hold.   The content of Section 5 has been improved and expanded upon in two separate papers. The structural properties in 5.1 and 5.2 appear in arXiv:1101.2603; the classification in 5.3 in arxiv:1101.2890. Please refer to Proposition 4.4 in the former as a reference for arXiv:0807.4795v1.
