We use simple properties of the Rasmussen invariant of knots to study its asymptotic behaviour on the orbits of a smooth volume preserving vector field on a compact domain in the 3-space. A comparison with the asymptotic signature allows us to prove that asymptotic knots are non-alternating, in general. Further we show that the Rasmussen invariant defines a quasi-morphism on the braid groups and derive estimates for the stable commutator and torsion lengths of alternating braids.
