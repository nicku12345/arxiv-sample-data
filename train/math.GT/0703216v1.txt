This paper studies an algebraic invariant of virtual knots called the biquandle. The biquandle generalizes the fundamental group and the quandle of virtual knots. The approach taken in this paper to the biquandle emphasizes understanding its structure in terms of compositions of morphisms, where elementary morphisms are associated to oriented classical and virtual crossings in the diagram.
