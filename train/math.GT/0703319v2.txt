In this paper we construct some invariants of spatial graphs by disk-summing the constituent knots and show the delta edge-homotopy invariance of them. As an application, we show that there exist infinitely many slice spatial embeddings of a planar graph up to delta edge-homotopy, and there exist infinitely many boundary spatial embeddings of a planar graph up to delta edge-homotopy.
