We first present three graphic surgery formulae for the degree n part Z_n of the Kontsevich-Kuperberg-Thurston universal finite type invariant of rational homology spheres. Each of these three formulae determines an alternate sum of the form \sum_{I \subset N} (-1)^{\sharp I}Z_n(M_I) where N is the set of components of a framed algebraically split link L in a rational homology sphere M, and M_I denotes the manifold resulting from the Dehn surgeries on the components of I. The first formula treats the case when L is a boundary link with n components, while the second one is for 3n--component algebraically split links. In the third formula, the link L has 2n components and the Milnor triple linking numbers of its 3--component sublinks vanish. The presented formulae are then applied to the study of the variation of Z_n under a p/q-surgery on a knot K. This variation is a degree n polynomial in q/p when the class of q/p in \QQ/\ZZ is fixed, and the coefficients of these polynomials are knot invariants, for which various topological properties or topological definitions are given.
