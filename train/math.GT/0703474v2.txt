Let K be a knot in a closed orientable irreducible 3-manifold M and let P be a Heegaard splitting of the knot complement of genus at least two. Suppose Q is a bridge surface for K. Then either \begin{itemize} \item d(P)\leq 2-\chi(Q-K), or \item K can be isotoped to be disjoint from Q so that after the isotopy Q is a Heegaard surface for the knot exterior and is isotopic to a possibly stabilized copy of P. \end{itemize}
