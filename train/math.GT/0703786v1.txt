The Gordian distance between two knots measures how many crossing changes are needed to transform one knot into the other. It is known that there are always infinitely many non-equivalent knots `between' a pair of knots of Gordian distance two. In this paper we prove an extreme generalisation of this fact: there are knots with arbitrarily prescribed Vassiliev invariants between every pair of knots of Gordian distance two.
