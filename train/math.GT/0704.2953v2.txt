We construct a 2-variable link polynomial, called W_L, for classical links by considering simultaneously the Kauffman state models for the Alexander and for the Jones polynomials. We conjecture that this polynomial is the product of two 1-variable polynomials, one of which is the Alexander polynomial.   We refine W_L to an ordered set of 3-variable polynomials for those links in 3-space which contain a Hopf link as a sublink.
