Necessary and sufficient conditions are given for a satellite knot to be fibered. Any knot \tilde k embeds in an unknotted solid torus \tilde V with arbitrary winding number in such a way that no satellite knot with pattern (\tilde V, \tilde k) is fibered. In particular, there exist nonfibered satellite knots with fibered pattern and companion knots and nonzero winding number.
