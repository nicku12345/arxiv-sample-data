It is proved that every knot in the major subfamilies of J. Berge's lens space surgery (i.e., knots yielding a lens space by Dehn surgery) is presented by an L-shaped (real) plane curve as a "divide knot" defined by N. A'Campo in the context of singularity theory of complex curves. For each knot given by Berge's parameters, the corresponding plane curve is constructed. The surgery coefficients are also considered. Such presentations support us to study each knot itself, and the relationship among the knots in the set of lens space surgeries.
