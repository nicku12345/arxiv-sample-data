S.Bauer and M.Furuta defined a stable cohomotopy refinement of the Seiberg-Witten invariants. In this paper, we prove a vanishing theorem of Bauer-Furuta invariants for 4-manifolds with smooth Z/2-actions. As an application, we give a constraint on smooth Z/2-actions on homotopy K3#K3, and construct a nonsmoothable locally linear Z/2-action on K3#K3. We also construct a nonsmoothable locally linear Z/2-action on K3.
