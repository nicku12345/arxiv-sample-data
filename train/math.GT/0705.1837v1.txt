Let S be a surface of finite type which is not a sphere with at most four punctures, a torus with at most two punctures, or a closed surface of genus two. Let \mathcal{MF} be the space of equivalence classes of measured foliations of compact support on S and let \mathcal{UMF} be the quotient space of \mathcal{MF} obtained by identifying two equivalence classes whenever they can be represented by topologically equivalent foliations, that is, forgetting the transverse measure. The extended mapping class group \Gamma^* of S acts as by homeomorphisms of \mathcal{UMF}. We show that the restriction of the action of the whole homeomorphism group of \mathcal{UMF} on some dense subset of \mathcal{UMF} coincides with the action of \Gamma^* on that subset. More precisely, let \mathcal{D} be the natural image in \mathcal{UMF} of the set of homotopy classes of not necessarily connected essential disjoint and pairwise nonhomotopic simple closed curves on S. The set \mathcal{D} is dense in \mathcal{UMF}, it is invariant by the action of \Gamma^* on \mathcal{UMF} and the restriction of the action of \Gamma^* on \mathcal{D} is faithful. We prove that the restriction of the action on \mathcal{D} of the group \mathrm{Homeo}(\mathcal{UMF}) coincides with the action of \Gamma^*(S) on that subspace.
