We describe an invariant of a contact 3-manifold with convex boundary as an element of Juh\'asz's sutured Floer homology. Our invariant generalizes the contact invariant in Heegaard Floer homology in the closed case, due to Ozsv\'ath and Szab\'o.   This version has some clarifications and new figures.
