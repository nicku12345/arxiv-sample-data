We introduce a new technique for showing classical knots and links are not slice. As one application we resolve a long-standing question as to whether certain natural families of knots contain topologically slice knots. We also present a simpler proof of the result of Cochran-Teichner that the successive quotients of the integral terms of the Cochran-Orr-Teichner filtration of the knot concordance group have rank 1. For links we have similar results. We show that the iterated Bing doubles of many algebraically slice knots are not topologically slice. Some of the proofs do not use the existence of the Cheeger-Gromov bound, a deep analytical tool used by Cochran-Teichner. Our main examples are actually boundary links but cannot be detected in the algebraic boundary link concordance group, nor by any \rho invariants associated to solvable representations into finite unitary groups.
