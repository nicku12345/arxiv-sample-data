Link Floer homology is an invariant for links which has recently been described entirely in a combinatorial way. Originally constructed with mod 2 coefficients, it was generalized to integer coefficients thanks to a sign refinement. In this paper, thanks to the spin extension of the permutation group we give an alternative construction of the combinatorial link Floer chain complex associated to a grid diagram with integer coefficients. We prove that the filtered homology of this complex is an invariant for the link and that it gives the previous sign refinement by means of a 2-cohomological class corresponding to the spin extension of the permutation group.
