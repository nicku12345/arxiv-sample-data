We determine the smooth concordance order of the 3-stranded pretzel knots P(p,q,r) with p,q,r odd. We show that each one of finite order is, in fact, ribbon, thereby proving the slice-ribbon conjecture for this family of knots. As corollaries we give new proofs of results first obtained by Fintushel-Stern and Casson-Gordon.
