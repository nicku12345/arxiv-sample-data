Let \Gamma be a 3-dimensional Kleinian punctured torus group with ccidental parabolic transformations. The deformation space of \Gamma in the group of M\"{o}bius transformations on the 2-sphere is well-known as the Maskit slice of punctured torus groups. In this paper, we study deformations \Gamma' of \Gamma in the group of M\"{o}bius transformations on the 3-sphere such that \Gamma' does not contain screw parabolic transformations. We will show that the space of the deformations is realized as a domain of 3-space \mathbb{R}^3, which contains the Maskit slice of punctured torus groups as a slice through a plane. Furthermore, we will show that the space also contains the Maskit slice of fourth-punctured sphere groups as a slice through another plane. Some of another slices of the space will be also studied.
