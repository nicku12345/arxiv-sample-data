We study the action of the mapping class group M(F) on the complex of curves of a non-orientable surface F. We obtain, by using a result of K. S. Brown, a presentation for M(F) defined in terms of the mapping class groups of the complementary surfaces of collections of curves, provided that F is not sporadic, i.e. the complex of curves of F is simply connected. We also compute a finite presentation for the mapping class group of each sporadic surface.
