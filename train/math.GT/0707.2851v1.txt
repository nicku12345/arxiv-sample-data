The oriented framed Homfly skein C of the annulus provides the natural parameter space for the Homfly satellite invariants of a knot. It contains a submodule C+ isomorphic to the algebra of the symmetric functions.   We collect and expand formulae relating elements expressed in terms of symmetric functions to Turaev's geometrical basis of C+. We reformulate the formulae of Rosso and Jones for quantum sl(N) invariants of cables in terms of plethysms of symmetric functions, and use the connection between quantum sl(N) invariants and C+ to give a formula for the satellite of a cable as an element of C+. We then analyse the case where a cable is decorated by the pattern which corresponds to a power sum in the symmetric function interpretation of C+ to get direct relations between the Homfly invariants of some diagrams decorated by power sums.
