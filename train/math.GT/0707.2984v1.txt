We prove that every trivalent marked bordered fatgraph comes equipped with a canonical generalized Magnus expansion in the sense of Kawazumi. This Magnus expansion is used to give canonical lifts of the higher Johnson homomorphisms \tau_m, for m\geq 1, to the Torelli groupoid, and we provide a recursive combinatorial formula for tensor representatives of these lifts. In particular, we give an explicit 1-cocycle in the dual fatgraph complex which lifts \tau_2 and thus answer affirmatively a question of Morita-Penner. To illustrate our techniques for calculating higher Johnson homomorphisms in general, we give explicit examples calculating \tau_m, for m\leq 3.
