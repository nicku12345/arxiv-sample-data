We provide a calculus for the presentation of closed 3-manifolds via nullhomotopic filling Dehn spheres and we use it to define an invariant of closed 3-manifolds by applying the state-sum machinery. As a potential application of this invariant, we show how to get lower bounds for the Matveev complexity of P2-irreducible closed 3-manifolds. We also describe an easy algorithm for constructing a nullhomotopic filling Dehn sphere of each closed 3-manifold from any of its one-vertex triangulations.
