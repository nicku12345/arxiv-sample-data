Let P be a connected smooth p-manifold. We describe the group of all cobordism classes of smooth maps of n-manifolds to P with singularities of a given cal K-invariant class in terms of certain stable homotopy groups by applying the relative homotopy principle on the existence level. We also deal with the oriented version and construct a classifying space to which this oriented cobordism group is represented as the set of homotopy classes of P in the codimension n<p and n\geqq p\geqq 2.
