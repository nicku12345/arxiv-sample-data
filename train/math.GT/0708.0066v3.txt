An ordered and oriented 2-component link L in the 3-sphere is said to be achiral if it is ambient isotopic to its mirror image ignoring the orientation and ordering of the components. Kirk-Livingston showed that if L is achiral then the linking number of L is not congruent to 2 modulo 4. In this paper we study orientation-preserving or reversing symmetries of 2-component links, spatial complete graphs on 5 vertices and spatial complete bipartite graphs on 3+3 vertices in detail, and determine the necessary conditions on linking numbers and Simon invariants for such links and spatial graphs to be symmetric.
