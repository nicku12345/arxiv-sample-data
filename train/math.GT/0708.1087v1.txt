We show that a null-homologous transverse knot K in the complement of an overtwisted disk in a contact 3-manifold is the boundary of a Legendrian ribbon if and only if it possesses a Seifert surface S such that the self-linking number of K with respect to S satisfies \sel(K,S)=-\chi(S). In particular, every null-homologous topological knot type in an overtwisted contact manifold can be represented by the boundary of a Legendrian ribbon. Finally, we show that a contact structure is tight if and only if every Legendrian ribbon minimizes genus in its relative homology class.
