We show that any immersion, which is not a covering of an embedded 2-orbifold, of a totally geodesic hyperbolic turnover in a complete orientable hyperbolic 3-orbifold is contained in a hyperbolic 3-suborbifold with totally geodesic boundary, called the "turnover core,'' whose volume is bounded from above by a function depending only on the area of the given turnover. Furthermore, we show that, for a given type of turnover, there are only finitely many possibilities for the turnover core. As a corollary, if the volume of a complete orientable hyperbolic 3-orbifold is at least 2\pi and if the fundamental group of the orbifold contains the fundamental group of a hyperbolic turnover (i.e., a triangle group), then the orbifold contains an embedded hyperbolic turnover.
