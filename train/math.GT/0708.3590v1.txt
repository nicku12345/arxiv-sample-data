Every torus knot can be represented as a Fourier-(1,1,2) knot which is the simplest possible Fourier representation for such a knot. This answers a question of Kauffman and confirms the conjecture made by Boocher, Daigle, Hoste and Zheng.   In particular, the torus knot T(p,q) can be parameterized as x(t)=cos(pt), y(t)=cos(qt+pi/(2p)), and z(t)=cos(pt+pi/2)\cos((q-p)t+pi/(2p)-pi/(4q)).
