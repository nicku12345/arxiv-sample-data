For any knot, the following are equivalent. (1) The infinite cyclic cover has uncountably many finite covers; (2) there exists a finite-image representation of the knot group for which the twisted Alexander polynomial vanishes; (3) the knot group admits a finite-image representation such that the image of the fundamental group of an incompressible Seifert surface is a proper subgroup of the image of the commutator subgroup of the knot group.
