Johnson has defined a surjective homomorphism from the Torelli subgroup of the mapping class group of the surface of genus g with one boundary component to \wedge^3 H, the third exterior product of the homology of the surface. Morita then extended Johnson's homomorphism to a homomorphism from the entire mapping class group to {1/2} \wedge^3 H \semi \sp(H). This Johnson-Morita homomorphism is not surjective, but its image is finite index in {1/2} \wedge^3 H \semi \sp(H). Here we give a description of the exact image of Morita's homomorphism. Further, we compute the image of the handlebody subgroup of the mapping class group under the same map.
