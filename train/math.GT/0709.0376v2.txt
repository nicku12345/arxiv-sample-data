We provide an algorithm to determine the Heegaard genus of simple 3-manifolds with non-empty boundary. More generally, we supply an algorithm to determine (up to ambient isotopy) all the Heegaard splittings of any given genus for the manifold. As a consequence, the tunnel number of a hyperbolic link is algorithmically computable. Our techniques rely on Rubinstein's work on almost normal surfaces, and also a new structure called a partially flat angled ideal triangulation.
