In this paper we study the convergence behavior of grafting rays to the Thurston boundary of Teichmuller space. When the grafting is done along a weighted system of simple closed curves or along a maximal uniquely ergodic lamination this behavior is the same as for Teichmuller geodesics and lines of minima. We also show that the ray grafted along a weighted system of simple closed curves is at bounded distance from Teichmuller geodesic.
