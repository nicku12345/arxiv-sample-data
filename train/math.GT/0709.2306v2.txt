It is known, since works of Burde and de Rham, that one can detect the roots of the Alexander polynomial of a knot by the study of the representations of the knot group into the group of the invertible upper triangular 2x2 matrices. In this work, we propose to generalize this result by considering the representations of the knot group into the group of the invertible upper triangular nxn matrices, n\geq 2. This approach will enable us to find the decomposition of the Alexander module with complex coefficients.
