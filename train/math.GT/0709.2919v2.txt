We investigate the geometry of hyperbolic knots and links whose diagrams have a high amount of twisting of multiple strands. We find information on volume and certain isotopy classes of geodesics for the complements of these links, based only on a diagram. The results are obtained by finding geometric information on generalized augmentations of these links.
