In order to obtain a Markov theorem without stabilization, Birman and Menasco introduced the notion of exchange related braids. In this paper I study the way the Fiedler polynomial distinguishes conjugacy classes of some particular braided knots. I introduce the Kauffman bracket in the solid torus. Its Taylor expansion give finite type invariants similar to the Fiedler polynomial. I investigate how these invariants distinguish exchange related braids.
