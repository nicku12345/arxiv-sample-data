If X is a compact set, a {\it topological contraction} is a self-embedding f such that the intersection of the successive images f^k(X), k>0, consists of one point. In dimension 3, we prove that there are smooth topological contractions of the handlebodies of genus \geq 2 whose image is essential. Our proof is based on an easy criterion for a simple curve to be essential in a handlebody.
