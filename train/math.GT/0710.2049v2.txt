We give an efficient simplicial formula for the volume and Chern-Simons invariant of a boundary-parabolic PSL(2,C)-representation of a tame 3-manifold. If the representation is the geometric representation of a hyperbolic 3-manifold, our formula computes the volume and Chern-Simons invariant directly from an ideal triangulation with no use of additional combinatorial topology. In particular, the Chern-Simons invariant is computed just as easily as the volume.
