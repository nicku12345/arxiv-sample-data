Let K be a knot in S^3 and X its complement. We study deformations of reducible metabelian representations of the knot group \pi_1(X) into SL(3,\mathbb{C}) which are associated to a double root of the Alexander polynomial. We prove that these reducible metabelian representations are smooth points of the representation variety and that they have irreducible non metabelian deformations.
