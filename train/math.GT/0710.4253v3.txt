Let \mathcal {M} be the space of all, including singular, long knots in 3-space and for which a fixed projection into the plane is an immersion. Let cl(\Sigma^{(1)}_{iness}) be the closure of the union of all singular knots in \mathcal {M} with exactly one ordinary double point and such that the two resolutions represent the same (non singular) knot type. We call \Sigma^{(1)}_{iness} the {\em inessential walls} and we call \mathcal {M}_{ess} = \mathcal {M} \setminus cl(\Sigma^{(1)}_{iness}) the {\em essential diagram space}. We construct a non trivial class in H^1(\mathcal {M}_{ess}; \mathbb{Z}[A, A^{-1}]) by an extension of the Kauffman bracket. This implies in particular that there are loops in \mathcal {M}_{ess} which consist of regular isotopies of knots together with crossing changings and which are not contractible in \mathcal {M}_{ess} (leading to the title of the paper).   We conjecture that our construction gives rise to a new knot polynomial for knots of unknotting number one.
