The orbifold group of the Borromean rings with singular angle 90 degrees, U, is a universal group, because every closed oriented 3--manifold M^{3} occurs as a quotient space M^{3} = H^{3}/G, where G is a finite index subgroup of U. Therefore, an interesting, but quite difficult problem, is to classify the finite index subgroups of the universal group U. One of the purposes of this paper is to begin this classification. In particular we analyze the classification of the finite index subgroups of U that are generated by rotations.
