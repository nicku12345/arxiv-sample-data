We show that a certain geometric property, the QSF introduced by S. Brick and M. Mihalik, is universally true for {\ibf all} finitely presented groups \Gamma. One way of defining this property is the existence of a smooth compact manifold M with \pi_1 M = \Gamma, such that \tilde M is geometrically simply-connected ({\it i.e.} without handles of index \lambda = 1). There are also alternative, more group-theoretical definitions, which are presentation independent. But \Gamma \in {\rm QSF} is not only a universal property, it is quite highly non-trivial too; its very special case for \Gamma = \pi_1 M^3 (where it means \pi_1^{\infty} \tilde M^3 = 0) is actually already known, as a corollary of G. Perelman's big breakthrough on the Geometrization of 3-Manifolds.
