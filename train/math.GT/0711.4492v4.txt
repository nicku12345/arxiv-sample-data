We introduce a general notion of "genericity" for countable subsets of a space with Borel measure, and apply it to the set of vertices in the curve complex of a surface S, interpreted as subset of the space of projective measured laminations in S, equipped with its natural Lebesgue measure.   We prove that, for any 3-manifold M, the set of curves c on a Heegaard surface S in M, such that every non-trivial Dehn twist at c yields a Heegaard splitting of high distance, is generic in the set of all essential simple closed curves on S.   Our definition of "genericity" is different and more intrinsic than alternative such existing notions, given e.g. via random walks or via limits of quotients of finite sets.
