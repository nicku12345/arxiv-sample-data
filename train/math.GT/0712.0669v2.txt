We find bases for naturally defined lattices over certain rings of integers in the SU(2)-TQFT-theory modules of surfaces. We consider the TQFT where the Kauffman's A variable is a root of unity of order four times an odd prime. As an application, we show that the Frohman Kania-Bartoszynska ideal invariant for 3-manifolds with boundary using the SU(2)-TQFT-theory is equal to the product of the ideals using the 2^{'}-theory and the SO(3)-TQFT-theory under a certain change of coefficients.
