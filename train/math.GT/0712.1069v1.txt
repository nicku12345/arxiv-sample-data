We consider the homotopy types of PD_4-complexes X with fundamental group \pi such that c.d.\pi=2 and \pi has one end. Let \beta=\beta_2(\pi;F_2) and w=w_1(X). Our main result is that (modulo two technical conditions on (\pi,w)) there are at most 2^\beta orbits of k-invariants determining "strongly minimal" complexes (i.e., those with homotopy intersection pairing \lambda_X trivial). The homotopy type of a PD_4-complex X with \pi a PD_2-group is determined by \pi, w, \lambda_X and the v_2-type of X. Our result also implies that Fox's 2-knot with metabelian group is determined up to TOP isotopy and reflection by its group.
