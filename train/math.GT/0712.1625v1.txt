Schubert proved that, given a composite link K with summands K_{1} and K_{2}, the bridge number of K satisfies the following equation: \beta(K)=\beta(K_{1})+\beta(K_{2})-1. In ``Conway Produts and Links with Multiple Bridge Surfaces", Scharlemann and Tomova proved that, given links K_{1} and K_{2}, there is a Conway product K_{1}\times_{c}K_{2} such that \beta(K_{1}\times_{c} K_{2}) \leq \beta(K_{1}) + \beta(K_{2}) - 1 In this paper, we define the generalized Conway product K_{1}\ast_{c}K_{2} and prove the lower bound \beta(K_{1}\ast_{c}K_{2}) \geq \beta(K_{1})-1 where K_{1} is the distinguished factor of the generalized product. We go on to show this lower bound is tight for an infinite class of links with arbitrarily high bridge number.
