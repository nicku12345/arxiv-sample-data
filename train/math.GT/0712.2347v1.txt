We define the virtual bridge number vb(K) and the virtual unknotting number vu(K) invariants for virtual knots. For ordinary knots K they are closely related to the bridge number b(K) and the unknotting number u(K) and we have vu(K)\leq u(K), vb(K)\leq b(K).   There are no ordinary knots K with b(K)=1. We show there are infinitely many homotopy classes of virtual knots each of which contains infinitely many isotopy classes of K with vb(K)=1. In fact for each i\in \N there exists K virtually homotopic (but not virtually isotopic) to the unknot with vb(K)=1 and vu(K)=i.
