We give several versions of local and global inverse mapping theorem for tame non necessarily smooth, mappings. Here tame mapping means a mapping which is subanalytic or, more generally, definable in some o-minimal structure. Our sufficient conditions are formulated in terms of various properties (convexity, positivity of some principal minors, contractiblity) of the space of Jacobi's matrices at smooth points.
