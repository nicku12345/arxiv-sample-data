In this paper we define a \mathbf{QP}^1-valued class function on the mapping class group \mathcal{M}_{g,2} of a surface \Sigma_{g,2} of genus g with two boundary components. Let E be a \Sigma_{g,2} bundle over a pair of pants P. Gluing to E the product of an annulus and P along the boundaries of each fiber, we obtain a closed surface bundle over P. We have another closed surface bundle by gluing to E the product of P and two disks.   The sign of our class function cobounds the 2-cocycle on \mathcal{M}_{g,2} defined by the difference of the signature of these two surface bundles over P.
