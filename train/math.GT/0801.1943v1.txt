Let k and k' be two knots in 3-sphere. Say k 1--dominates k', if there is a proper degree 1 map f\co E(k)\to E(k'), between knot exterior of k_i.   Theorem: Suppose that any companion of k is prime. If k 1--dominates k' with the same Gromov volume, then k' can be obtained from k by finitely many de-satellizations.   The condition of "same Gromov volume" clearly can not be removed. We also give a new construction of 1-domination between knots with same Gromov volume to show that the condition "any companion of k is prime" can not be removed.
