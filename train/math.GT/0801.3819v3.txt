We study two sorts of actions on the space of conjugacy classes of irreducible SU_2-representations of a knot group. One of them is an involution which comes from the algebraic structure of SU_2 and the other is the action by the outer automorphism group of the knot group. In particular, we consider them on an 1-dimensional smooth part of the space, which is canonically oriented and metrized via a Reidemeister torsion volume form. As an application we show that the Reidemeister torsion function on the 1-dimensional subspace has symmetry about the metrization.
