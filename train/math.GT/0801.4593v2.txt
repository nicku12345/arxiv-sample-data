Let \mathcal{A} be a line arrangement in the complex projective plane \mathbb{P}^2, having the points of multiplicity \geq 3 situated on two lines in \mathcal{A}, say H_0 and H_{\infty}. Then we show that the non-local irreducible components of the first resonance variety \mathcal{R}_1(\mathcal{A}) are 2-dimensional and correspond to parallelograms \mathcal{P} in \mathbb{C}^2=\mathbb{P}^2 \setminus H_{\infty} whose sides are in \mathcal{A} and for which H_0 is a diagonal.
