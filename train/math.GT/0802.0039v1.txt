In this paper we give an introduction to the volume conjecture and its generalizations. Especially we discuss relations of the asymptotic behaviors of the colored Jones polynomials of a knot with different parameters to representations of the fundamental group of the knot complement at the special linear group over complex numbers by taking the figure-eight knot and torus knots as examples.
