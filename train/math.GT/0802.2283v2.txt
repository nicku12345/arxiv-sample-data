Motivated by the study of ribbon knots we explore symmetric unions, a beautiful construction introduced by Kinoshita and Terasaka in 1957. For symmetric diagrams we develop a two-variable refinement W_D(s,t) of the Jones polynomial that is invariant under symmetric Reidemeister moves. Here the two variables s and t are associated to the two types of crossings, respectively on and off the symmetry axis. From sample calculations we deduce that a ribbon knot can have essentially distinct symmetric union presentations even if the partial knots are the same.   If D is a symmetric union diagram representing a ribbon knot K, then the polynomial W_D(s,t) nicely reflects the geometric properties of K. In particular it elucidates the connection between the Jones polynomials of K and its partial knots K_\pm: we obtain W_D(t,t) = V_K(t) and W_D(-1,t) = V_{K_-}(t) \cdot V_{K_+}(t), which has the form of a symmetric product f(t) \cdot f(t^{-1}) reminiscent of the Alexander polynomial of ribbon knots.
