Let \beta be a braid on n strands, with exponent sum w. Let \Delta be the Garside half-twist braid. We prove that the coefficient of v^{w-n+1} in the Homfly polynomial of the closure of \beta agrees with (-1)^{n-1} times the coefficient of v^{w+n^2-1} in the Homfly polynomial of the closure of \beta\Delta^2. This coincidence implies that the lower Morton--Franks-Williams estimate for the v--degree of the Homfly polynomial of \hat\beta is sharp if and only if the upper MFW estimate is sharp for the v--degree of the Homfly polynomial of \hat{\beta\Delta^2}.
