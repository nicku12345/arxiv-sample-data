Let F be an incompressible, meridionally incompressible and not boundary-parallel surface with boundary in the complement of an algebraic tangle (B,T). Then F separates the strings of T in B and the boundary slope of F is uniquely determined by (B,T) and hence we can define the slope of the algebraic tangle. In addition to the Conway's tangle sum, we define a natural product of two tangles. The slopes and binary operation on algebraic tangles lead an algebraic structure which is isomorphic to the rational numbers.   We introduce a new knot and link class, algebraically alternating knots and links, roughly speaking which are constructed from alternating knots and links by replacing some crossings with algebraic tangles. We give a necessary and sufficient condition for a closed surface to be incompressible and meridionally incompressible in the complement of an algebraically alternating knot or link K, in particular we show that if K is a knot, then the complement of K does not contain such a surface.
