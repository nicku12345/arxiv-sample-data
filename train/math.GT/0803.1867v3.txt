We study the asymptotic geometry of Teichmueller geodesic rays. We show that when the transverse measures to the vertical foliations of the quadratic differentials determining two different rays are topologically equivalent, but are not absolutely continuous with respect to each other, then the rays diverge in Teichmueller space.
