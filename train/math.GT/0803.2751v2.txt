We prove (Theorem~1.5) that there exists a constant \Lambda > 0 so that if M is a (\mu,d)-generic complete hyperbolic 3-manifold of volume \vol[M] < \infty and \Sigma \subset M is a Heegaard surface of genus g(\Sigma) > \Lambda \vol[M], then d(\Sigma) \leq 2, where d(\Sigma) denotes the distance of \Sigma as defined by Hempel.   The key for the proof of the main result is Theorem~1.8 which is on independent interest. There we prove that if M is a compact 3-manifold that can be triangulated using at most t tetrahedra (possibly with missing or truncated vertices), and \Sigma is a Heegaard surface for M with g(\Sigma) \geq 76t+26, then d(\Sigma) \leq 2.
