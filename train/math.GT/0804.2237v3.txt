In this note we find new relations in the mapping class group of a genus two surface with n boundary components for n=1,..., 8 which induce a genus two Lefschetz fibration CP^2#13CP^2bar \to S^2 with n disjoint sections. As a consequence, we observe any holomorphic genus 2 Lefschetz fibration without separating singular fibers admits a section.
