We classify right-veering homeomorphisms of the once-punctured torus using the Burau representation of the 3-strand braid group. We show that reducible and periodic mapping classes in B_3 can be identified as right-veering by consideration of the reduced version of the Burau representation. Given any element beta in B_3, we give a method to quickly determine its action on the generators of the fundamental group of the 3-times punctured disk. This action which determines whether beta is right-veering, left-veering, or neither.
