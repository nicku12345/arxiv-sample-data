Let Mod(S) denote the mapping class group of a compact, orientable surface S. We prove that finitely generated subgroups of Mod(S) which are not virtually abelian have uniform exponential growth with minimal growth rate bounded below by a constant depending only, and necessarily, on S. For the proof, we find in any such subgroup explicit free group generators which are "short" in any word metric. Besides bounding growth, this allows a bound on the return probability of simple random walks.
