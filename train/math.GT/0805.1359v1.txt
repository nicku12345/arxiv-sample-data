Every cusped, finite-volume hyperbolic three-manifold has a canonical decomposition into ideal polyhedra. We study the canonical decomposition of the hyperbolic manifold obtained by filling some (but not all) of the cusps with solid tori: in a broad range of cases, generic in an appropriate sense, this decomposition can be predicted from that of the unfilled manifold. As an example, we treat all hyperbolic fillings on one cusp of the Whitehead link complement.
