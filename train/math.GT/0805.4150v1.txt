Let X be a finite aspherical CW-complex whose fundamental group \pi_1(X) possesses a subnormal series \pi_1(X) \rhd G_m \rhd ... \rhd G_0 with a non-trivial elementary amenable group G_0. We investigate the L^2-invariants of the universal covering of such a CW-complex X. We show that the Novikov-Shubin invariants \alpha_n({\tilde X}) are positive. We further prove that the L^2-torsion \rho^{(2)}({\tilde X}) vanishes if \pi_1(X) has semi-integral determinant.
