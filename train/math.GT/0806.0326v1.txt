A contractible simplicial complex is constructed that parametrizes different ways of representing a fixed one-dimensional homology class in a closed orientable surface by isotopy classes of systems of disjoint oriented simple closed curves. This is a variant on an earlier construction of Bestvina-Bux-Margalit.
