There are some similarities between cohomology of SU(2)-representation varieties of the fundamental group of some link complements and the Khovanov homology of the links. We start here a program to explain a possible source of these similarities. We introduce a symplectic manifold {\mathscr M} with an action of the braid group B_{2n} preserving the symplectic structure. The action allows to associate a Lagrangian submanifold of {\mathscr M} to every braid. The representation variety of a link can then be described as the intersection of such Lagrangian submanifolds, given a braid presentation of the link. We expect this to go some way in explaining the similarities mentioned above.
