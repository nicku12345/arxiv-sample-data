A projective mirror polyhedron is a projective polyhedron endowed with reflections across its faces. We construct an explicit diffeomorphism between the moduli space of a mirror projective polyhedron with fixed dihedral angles in (0,\frac{\pi}{2}], and the union of n copies of \R^d, when the polyhedron has the combinatorics of an \emph{ecimahedron}, an infinite class of combinatorial polyhedra we introduce here. Moreover, the integers n and d can be computed explicitly in terms of the combinatorics and the fixed dihedral angles.
