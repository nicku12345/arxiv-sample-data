We say that a link L_1 is an s-major of a link L_2 if any diagram of L_1 can be transformed into a diagram of L_2 by changing some crossings and smoothing some crossings. This relation is a partial ordering on the set of all prime alternating links. We determine this partial order for all prime alternating knots and links with the crossing number less than or equal to six. The proofs are given by graph-theoretic methods.
