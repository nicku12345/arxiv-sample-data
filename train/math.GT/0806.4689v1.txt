We construct families of manifolds that have pairs of genus g Heegaard splittings that must be stabilized roughly g times to become equivalent. We also show that when two unstabilized, boundary-unstabilized Heegaard splittings are amalgamated by a "sufficiently complicated" map, the resulting splitting is unstabilized. As a corollary, we produce a manifold that has distance one Heegaard splittings of arbitrarily high genus. Finally, we show that in a 3-manifold formed by a sufficiently complicated gluing, a low genus, unstabilized Heegaard splitting can be expressed in a unique way as an amalgamation over the gluing surface.
