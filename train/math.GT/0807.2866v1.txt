We describe for each postive integer k a 3-manifold with Heegaard surfaces of genus 2k and 2k-1 such that any common stabilization of these two surfaces has genus at least 3k-1. We also show that for every positive n, there is a 3-manifold that has n pairwise non-isotopic Heegaard splittings of the same genus all of which are stabilized.
