Let M_1 and M_2 be orientable irreducible 3--manifolds with connected boundary and suppose \partial M_1\cong\partial M_2. Let M be a closed 3--manifold obtained by gluing M_1 to M_2 along the boundary. We show that if the gluing homeomorphism is sufficiently complicated, then M is not homeomorphic to S^3 and all small-genus Heegaard splittings of M are standard in a certain sense. In particular, g(M)=g(M_1)+g(M_2)-g(\partial M_i), where g(M) denotes the Heegaard genus of M. This theorem is also true for certain manifolds with multiple boundary components.
