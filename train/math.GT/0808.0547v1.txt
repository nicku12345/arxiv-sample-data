Let two Heegaard splittings V_1 \cup W_1 and V_2 \cup W_2 of a 3-manifold M be given. We consider the union stabilization M=V \cup W which is a common stabilization of V_1 \cup W_1 and V_2 \cup W_2 having the property that V=V_1 \cup V_2. We show that any two Heegaard splittings of a 3-manifold have a union stabilization. We also give some examples with numerical bounds on the minimal genus of union stabilization. On the other hand, we give an example of a candidate for which the minimal genus of union stabilization is strictly larger than the usual stable genus -- the minimal genus of common stabilization.
