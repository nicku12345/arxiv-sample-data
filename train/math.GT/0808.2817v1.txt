This largely technical paper is divided into two parts: part I: An account of P. Ozsvath and Z. Szabo's construction of the link surgery spectral sequence. There are no new results here, but this part slightly modifies and expands their proof and is included as an aid to part II. part II: Some modifications of the spectral sequence suitable for knot Floer homology; an exposition of the invariance of the spectral sequence, under a suitable equivalence, from alterations of the underlying bouquet; and an account of the morphisms induced on the spectral sequences by suitable four dimensional cobordisms and how they depend upon the four manifold. This is the author's effort to investigate a question at the end of the introduction to P. Ozsvath's and Z. Szabo's paper "On the Heegaard-Floer homology of double branched covers."
