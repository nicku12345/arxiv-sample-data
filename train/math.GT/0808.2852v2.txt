We show that there exist infinitely many pairs of distinct knots in the 3-sphere such that each pair can yield homeomorphic lens spaces by the same Dehn surgery. Moreover, each knot of the pair can be chosen to be a torus knot, a satellite knot or a hyperbolic knot, except that both cannot be satellite knots simultaneously. This exception is shown to be unavoidable by the classical theory of binary quadratic forms.
