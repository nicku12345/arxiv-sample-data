Let H(p) be the set of 2-bridge knots K whose group G is mapped onto a non-trivial free product, Z/2 * Z/p, p being odd. Then there is an algebraic integer s_0 such that for any K in H(p), G has a parabolic representation \rho into SL(2, Z[s_0]) \subset SL(2,C). Let \Delta(t) be the twisted Alexander polynomial associated to \rho. Then we prove that for any K in H(p), \Delta(1)=-2s_0^{-1} and \Delta(-1)=-2s_0^{-1}\mu^2, where s_0^{-1}, \mu \in Z[s_0]. The number \mu can be recursively evaluated.
