We introduce diagrams and Reidemeister moves for links in FxS^{1}, where F is an orientable surface. Using these diagrams we compute (in a new way) the Kauffman Bracket Skein Modules (KBSM) for D^{2}xS^{1} and AxS^{1}, where D^{2} is a disk and A is an annulus. Moreover, we also find the KBSM for the F_{0,3}xS^{1}, where F_{0,3} denotes a disk with two holes, and thus show that the module is free.
