Using Gauge theoretical techniques employed by Lisca for 2-bridge knots and by Greene-Jabuka for 3-stranded pretzel knots, we show that no member of the family of Montesinos knots M(0;[m_1+1,n_1+2],[m_2+1,n_2+2],q), with certain restrictions on m_i, n_i, and q, can be (smoothly) slice. Our techniques use Donaldson's diagonalization theorem and the fact that the 2-fold covers of Montisinos knots bound plumbing 4-manifolds, many of which are negative definite. Some of our examples include knots with signature 0 and square determinant.
