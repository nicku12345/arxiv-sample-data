Consider a geometrically finite Kleinian group G without parabolic or elliptic elements, with its Kleinian manifold M=(\H^3\cup \Omega_G)/G. Suppose that for each boundary component of M, either a maximal and connected measured lamination in the Masur domain or a marked conformal structure is given. In this setting, we shall prove that there is an algebraic limit \Gamma of quasi-conformal deformations of G such that there is a homeomorphism h from \mathrm{Int} M to \H^3/\Gamma compatible with the natural isomorphism from G to \Gamma, the given laminations are unrealisable in \H^3/\Gamma, and the given conformal structures are pushed forward by h to those of \H^3/\Gamma. Based on this theorem and its proof, in the subsequent paper, the Bers-Thurston conjecture, saying that every finitely generated Kleinian group is an algebraic limit of quasi-conformal deformations of minimally parabolic geometrically finite group, is proved using recent solutions of Marden's conjecture by Agol, Calegari-Gabai, and the ending lamination conjecture by Minsky collaborating with Brock, Canary and Masur.
