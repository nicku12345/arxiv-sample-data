We determine all the Q-fundamental surfaces in (p,1)-lens spaces and (p,2)-lens spaces with respect to natural triangulations with p tetrahedra.   For general (p,q)-lens spaces, we give an upper bound for elements of vectors which represent Q-fundamental surfaces with no quadrilateral normal disks disjoint from the core circles of lens spaces.   We also give some examples of non-orientable closed surfaces which are Q-fundamental surfaces with such quadrilateral normal disks.
