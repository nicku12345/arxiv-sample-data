We give a concrete example of an infinite sequence of (p_n, q_n)-lens spaces L(p_n, q_n) with natural triangulations T(p_n, q_n) with p_n taterahedra such that L(p_n, q_n) contains a certain non-orientable closed surface which is fundamental with respect to T(p_n, q_n) and of minimal crosscap number among all closed non-orientable surfaces in L(p_n, q_n) and has n-2 parallel sheets of normal disks of a quadrilateral type disjoint from the pair of core circles of L(p_n, q_n). Actually, we can set p_0=0, q_0=1, p_{k+1}=3p_k+2q_k and q_{k+1}=p_k+q_k.
