Let M be a closed orientable 3-manifold with a genus two Heegaard splitting (V_1, V_2; F) and a non-trivial JSJ-decomposition, where all components of the intersection of the JSJ-tori and V_i are not \partial-parallel in V_i for i=1,2. If G is a finite group of orientation-preserving diffeomorphisms acting on M which preserves each handlebody of the Heegaard splitting and each piece of the JSJ-decomposition of M, then G\cong \mathbb{Z}_2 or \mathbb{D}_2 if V_j\cap(\cup T_i) consists of at most two disks or at most two annuli.
