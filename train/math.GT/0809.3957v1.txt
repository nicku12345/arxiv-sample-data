We extend the definition of Bockstein basis \sigma(G) to nilpotent groups G. A metrizable space X is called a {\it Bockstein space} if \dim_G(X) = \sup\{\dim_H(X) | H\in \sigma(G)\} for all Abelian groups G. Bockstein First Theorem says that all compact spaces are Bockstein spaces.   Here are the main results of the paper: Let X be a Bockstein space. If G is nilpotent, then \dim_G(X) \leq 1 if and only if \sup\{\dim_H(X) | H\in\sigma(G)\}\leq 1.   X is a Bockstein space if and only if \dim_{\Z_{(l)}} (X) = \dim_{\hat{Z}_{(l)}}(X) for all subsets l of prime numbers.
