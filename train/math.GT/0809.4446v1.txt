In this paper we define, for each aspherical orientable 3-manifold M endowed with a \emph{torus splitting} \c{T}, a 2-dimensional fundamental l_1-class [M]^{\c{T}} whose l_1-norm has similar properties as the Gromov simplicial volume of M (additivity under torus splittings and isometry under finite covering maps). Next, we use the Gromov simplicial volume of M and the l_1-norm of [M]^{\c{T}} to give a complete characterization of those nonzero degree maps f\co M\to N which are homotopic to a {\rm deg}(f)-covering map. As an application we characterize those degree one maps f\co M\to N which are homotopic to a homeomorphism in terms of bounded cohomology classes.
