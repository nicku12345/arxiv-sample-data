In this paper we describe a procedure for refining the given triangulation of a 3-manifold that scales the PL-metric according to a given weight function while creating no new normal surfaces.   It is known that an incompressible surface F in a triangulated 3-manifold M is isotopic to a normal surface that is of minimal PL-area in the isotopy class of F. Using the above scaling refinement we prove the converse. If F is a surface in a closed 3-manifold M such that for any triangulation \tau of M, F is isotopic to a \tau-normal surface F(\tau) that is of minimal PL-area in its isotopy class, then we show that F is incompressible.
