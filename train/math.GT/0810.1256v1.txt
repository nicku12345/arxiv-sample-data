Given a 3 manifold M with torus boundary and an ideal triangulation, Yoshida and Tillmann give different methods to construct surfaces embedded in M from ideal points of the deformation variety. Yoshida builds a surface from twisted squares whereas Tillmann produces a spun-normal surface. We investigate the relation between the generated surfaces and extend a result of Tillmann's (that if the ideal point of the deformation variety corresponds to an ideal point of the character variety then the generated spun-normal surface is detected by the character variety) to the generated twisted squares surfaces.
