We give a method for obtaining a handle decomposition of an n-manifold if the manifold is given by isometric side-pairings of a polyhedron in \en, \sn or \hn. Every cycle of k-faces on the polyhedron corresponds to an (n-k)-handle of the manifold.   Two applications of the method are given. One helps recognize when a noncompact hyperbolic 3-manifold is a complement of a link in S^3 (and automatically produces the link diagram), the other shows that a topological S^4 described by the author in \cite{Ivansic3} is diffeomorphic to the standard differentiable S^4.
