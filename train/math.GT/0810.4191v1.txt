The survey we are presenting is over 22 years old but it has still some ideas which where never published (except in Polish). This survey is the base of the third Chapter of my book: KNOTS: From combinatorics of knot diagrams to combinatorial topology based on knots, which is still in preparation (but compare http://arxiv.org/pdf/math.GT/0512630).   The purpose of this survey is to present a new combinatorial method of constructing invariants of isotopy classes of tame links. The period of time between the spring of 1984 and the summer of 1985 was full of discoveries which revolutionized the knot theory and will have a deep impact on some other branches of mathematics. It started by the discovery of Jones of the new polynomial invariant of links (in May 1984), and the last big step (which will be described in this survey) has been made by Kauffman in August 1985 when Kauffman applied his method which allowed him to unify almost all previous work. This survey is far from being complete, even if we limit ourselves to the purely combinatorial methods and to the period May, 1984 -- September, 1985.
