According to Pixton, there are Morse-Smale diffeomorphisms of the 3-sphere which have no energy function, that is a Lyapunov function whose critical points are all periodic points of the diffeomorphism. We introduce the concept of quasi-energy function for a Morse-Smale diffeomorphism as a Lyapunov function with the least number of critical points and construct a quasi-energy function for any diffeomorphism from some class of Morse-Smale diffeomorphisms on the 3-sphere.
