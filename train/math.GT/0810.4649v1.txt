We investigate the Gram determinant of the bilinear form based on curves in a planar surface, with a focus on the disk with two holes. We prove that the determinant based on n-1 curves divides the determinant based on n curves. Motivated by the work on Gram determinants based on curves in a disk and curves in an annulus (Temperley-Lieb algebra of type A and B, respectively), we calculate several examples of the Gram determinant based on curves in a disk with two holes and advance conjectures on the complete factorization of Gram determinants.
