Using computer calculations and working with representatives of pretzel tangles we established general adequacy criteria for different classes of knots and links. Based on adequate graphs obtained from all Kauffman states of an alternating link we defined a new numerical invariant: adequacy number, and computed adequacy polynomial which is the invariant of alternating link families. Adequacy polynomial distinguishes (up to mutation) all families of alternating knots and links whose generating link has at most n=12 crossings.
