The aim of this article is to detect new classes of quasi-alternating links. Quasi-alternating links are a natural generalization of alternating links. Their knot Floer and Khovanov homology are particularly easy to compute. Since knot Floer homology detects the genus of a knot as well as whether a knot is fibered, as provided bounds on unknotting number and slice genus, characterization of quasi-alternating links becomes an interesting open problem. We show that there exist classes of non-alternating Montesinos links, which are quasi-alternating.
