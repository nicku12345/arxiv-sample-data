In this paper we solve the following problem in the affirmative: Let Z be a continuum in the plane \complex and suppose that h:Z\times [0,1]\to\complex is an isotopy starting at the identity. Can h be extended to an isotopy of the plane?   We will provide a new characterization of an accessible point in a planar continuum Z and use it to show that an accessible point is preserved during the isotopy. We show next that the isotopy can be extended over hyperbolic crosscuts. The proof makes use of the notion of a metric external ray, which mimics the notion of a conformal external ray, but is easier to control during an isotopy.
