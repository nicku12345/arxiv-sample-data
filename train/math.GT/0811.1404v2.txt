Flapan--Naimi--Pommersheim showed that every spatial embedding of K_{10}, the complete graph on ten vertices, contains a non-split three-component link; that is, K_{10} is intrinsically triple-linked in \mathbb{R}^3. The work of Bowlin--Foisy and Flapan--Foisy--Naimi--Pommersheim extended the list of known intrinsically triple-linked graphs in \mathbb{R}^3 to include several other families of graphs. In this paper, we will show that while some of these graphs can be embedded 3-linklessly in \mathbb{R}P^3, K_{10} is intrinsically triple-linked in \mathbb{R}P^3.
