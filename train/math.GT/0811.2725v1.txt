In this note, we study the integral of the 1-form \log x\frac{dy}{y}-\log y\frac{dx}{x} over certain plane curves defined by A-polynomials of knots. It is quite surprising that a Chern-Simons type invariant of 3-manifolds, which can be geometrically computed, may be used to get the exact values of those integrals. The arithmetic nature of these integrals is still unknown at the moment and deserved further investigation.
