In this paper we determined all of the possible self mapping degrees of the manifolds with S^3-geometry, which are supposed to be all 3-manifolds with finite fundamental groups. This is a part of a project to determine all possible self mapping degrees of all closed orientable 3-manifold in Thurston's picture.
