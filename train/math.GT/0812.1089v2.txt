A Chebyshev knot is a knot which admits a parametrization of the form  x(t)=T_a(t); \ y(t)=T_b(t) ; \ z(t)= T_c(t + \phi),  where a,b,c are pairwise coprime, T_n(t) is the Chebyshev polynomial of degree n, and \phi \in \RR . Chebyshev knots are non compact analogues of the classical Lissajous knots. We show that there are infinitely many Chebyshev knots with \phi = 0. We also show that every knot is a Chebyshev knot.
