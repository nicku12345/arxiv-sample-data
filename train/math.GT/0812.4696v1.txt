Knots and links in 3-manifolds are studied by applying intersection invariants to singular concordances. The resulting link invariants generalize the Arf invariant, the mod 2 Sato-Levine invariants, and Milnor's triple linking numbers. Besides fitting into a general theory of Whitney towers, these invariants provide obstructions to the existence of a singular concordance which can be homotoped to an embedding after stabilization by connected sums with S^2\times S^2. Results include classifications of stably slice links in orientable 3-manifolds, stable knot concordance in products of an orientable surface with the circle, and stable link concordance for many links of null-homotopic knots in orientable 3-manifolds.
