It is known that every exotic smooth structure on a simply connected closed 4-manifold is determined by a codimention zero compact contractible Stein submanifold and an involution on its boundary. Such a pair is called a cork. In this paper, we construct infinitely many knotted imbeddings of corks in 4-manifolds such that they induce infinitely many different exotic smooth structures. We also show that we can imbed an arbitrary finite number of corks disjointly into 4-manifolds, so that the corresponding involutions on the boundary of the contractible 4-manifolds give mutually different exotic structures. Furthermore, we construct similar examples for plugs.
