We present computational results about quasi-alternating knots and links and odd homology obtained by looking at link families in the Conway notation. More precisely, we list quasi-alternating links up to 12 crossings and the first examples of quasi-alternating knots and links with at least two different minimal diagrams, where one is quasi-alternating and the other is not. We provide examples of knots and links with n\le 12 crossings which are homologically thin and have no minimal quasi-alternating diagrams. These links are candidates for homologically thin links that are not quasi-alternating. For one of our candidates [JaSa1], knot 11n_{50}, J. Greene proved that it is not quasi-alternating, so this is the first example of homologically thin knot which is not quasi-alternating [Gr]. Computations were performed by A. Shumakovitch's program \emph{KhoHo}, the program \emph{Knotscape}, and our program \emph{LinKnot}.
