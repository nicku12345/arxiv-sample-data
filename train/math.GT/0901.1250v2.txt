Given a map f: M \to M of closed topological manifolds we define torsion obstructions whose vanishing is a necessary condition for f being homotopy equivalent to a projection of a locally trivial fiber bundle. If N = S^1, these torsion obstructions are identified with the ones due to Farrell.   We have changed the exposition according to the comments of the referee and corrected some typos. The paper will appear in Geometriae Dedicata.
