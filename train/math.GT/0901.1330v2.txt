We show that if \mathcal{L} is a codimension-one lamination in a finite volume hyperbolic 3-manifold such that the principal curvatures of each leaf of \mathcal{L} are all in the interval (-\delta ,\delta) for a fixed \delta\in[0,1) and no complimentary region of \mathcal{L} is an interval bundle over a surface, then each boundary leaf of \mathcal{L} has a nontrivial fundamental group. We also prove existence of a fixed constant \delta_0 > 0 such that if \mathcal{L} is a codimension-one lamination in a finite volume hyperbolic 3-manifold such that the principal curvatures of each leaf of \mathcal{L} are all in the interval (-\delta_0 ,\delta_0) and no complimentary region of \mathcal{L} is an interval bundle over a surface, then each boundary leaf of \mathcal{L} has a noncyclic fundamental group.
