We study the action of the mapping class group on the real homology of finite covers of a topological surface. We use the homological representation of the mapping class to construct a faithful infinite-dimensional representation of the mapping class group. We show that this representation detects the Nielsen-Thurston classification of each mapping class. We then discuss some examples that occur in the theory of braid groups and develop an analogous theory for automorphisms of free groups. We close with some open problems.
