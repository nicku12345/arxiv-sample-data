A convex projective surface is the quotient of a properly convex open \Omega of \mathbb{P}(\R) by a discret subgroup \Gamma of \mathrm{SL}_3(\R). We give some caracterisations of the fact that a convex projective surface is of finite volume for the Busemann's measure. We deduce of this that if \Omega is not a triangle then \Omega is strictly convex, with \Cc^1 boundary and that a convex projective surface S is of finite volume if and only if the dual surface is of finite volume.
