We introduce the notion of a quandle with a good involution and its homology groups. Carter et al. defined quandle cocycle invariants for oriented links and oriented surface-links. By use of good involutions, quandle cocyle invariants can be defined for links and surface-links which are not necessarily oriented or orientable. The invariants can be used in order to estimate the minimal triple point numbers of non-orientable surface-links.
