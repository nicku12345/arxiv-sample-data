This paper uses results on the classification of minimal triangulations of 3-manifolds to produce additional results, using covering spaces. Using previous work on minimal triangulations of lens spaces, it is shown that the lens space L(4k, 2k-1) and the generalised quaternionic space S^3/Q_{4k} have complexity k, where k\ge 2. Moreover, it is shown that their minimal triangulations are unique.
