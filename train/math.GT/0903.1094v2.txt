Consider the cyclic group C_2 of order two acting by complex-conjugation on the unit circle S^1. The main result is that a finitely dominated manifold W of dimension > 4 admits a cocompact, free, discontinuous action by the infinite dihedral group D_\infty if and only if W is the infinite cyclic cover of a free C_2-manifold M such that M admits a C_2-equivariant manifold approximate fibration to S^1. The novelty in this setting is the existence of codimension-one, invariant submanifolds of M and W. Along the way, we develop an equivariant sucking principle for certain orthogonal actions of finite groups on Euclidean space.
