We study compatible contact structures of fibered Seifert multilinks in homology 3-spheres and especially give a necessary and sufficient condition for the contact structure to be tight in the case where the Seifert fibration is positively twisted. As a corollary we determine the strongly quasipositivity of fibered Seifert links in the 3-sphere. We also study the compatible contact structures of cablings along links in any 3-manifolds.
