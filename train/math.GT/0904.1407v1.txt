We describe some properties of noncompact Euclidean cone manifolds with cone angles less than c less than 2pi and singular locus a submanifold. More precisely, we describe its structure outside a compact set. As a corollary we classify those with cone angles less than 3pi/2 and those with all cone angles equal to 3pi/2.
