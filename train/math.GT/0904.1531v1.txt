Let C be some class of objects equipped with a set of simplifying moves. When we apply these to a given object M in C as long as possible, we get a root of M.   Our main result is that under certain conditions the root of any object exists and is unique. We apply this result to different situations and get several new results and new proofs of known results. Among them there are a new proof of the Kneser-Milnor prime decomposition theorem for 3-manifolds and different versions of this theorem for cobordisms, knotted graphs, and orbifolds.
