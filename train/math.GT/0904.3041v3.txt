Normal and almost normal surfaces are essential tools for algorithmic 3-manifold topology, but to use them requires exponentially slow enumeration algorithms in a high-dimensional vector space. The quadrilateral coordinates of Tollefson alleviate this problem considerably for normal surfaces, by reducing the dimension of this vector space from 7n to 3n (where n is the complexity of the underlying triangulation). Here we develop an analogous theory for octagonal almost normal surfaces, using quadrilateral and octagon coordinates to reduce this dimension from 10n to 6n. As an application, we show that quadrilateral-octagon coordinates can be used exclusively in the streamlined 3-sphere recognition algorithm of Jaco, Rubinstein and Thompson, reducing experimental running times by factors of thousands. We also introduce joint coordinates, a system with only 3n dimensions for octagonal almost normal surfaces that has appealing geometric properties.
