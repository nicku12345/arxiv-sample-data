The mapping class group of a genus g surface \Sigma_{g,1} with one boundary component is known to have a simple yet infinite presentation with generators given by elementary moves called Whitehead moves on so-called marked bordered fatgraphs. In this paper, we introduce an algorithm called "fatgraph Nielsen reduction" which, from the action of a mapping class \varphi\in MC_{g,1} of \Sigma_{g,1} on the fundamental group \pi_1(\Sigma_{g,1}) of \Sigma_{g,1}, determines a sequence of Whitehead moves representing \varphi beginning at any choice of marked bordered fatgraph. As a consequence, this leads to an algorithm which factors any mapping class given by its action on \pi(\Sigma_{g,1}) in terms of a certain generating set for MC_{g,1}.
