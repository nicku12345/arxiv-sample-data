For an oriented link diagram D, the warping degree d(D) is the smallest number of crossing changes which are needed to obtain a monotone diagram from D. We show that d(D)+d(-D)+sr(D) is less than or equal to the crossing number of D, where -D denotes the inverse of D and sr(D) denotes the number of components which have at least one self-crossing. Moreover, we give a necessary and sufficient condition for the equality. We also consider the minimal d(D)+d(-D)+sr(D) for all diagrams D. For the warping degree and linking warping degree, we show some relations to the linking number, unknotting number, and the splitting number.
