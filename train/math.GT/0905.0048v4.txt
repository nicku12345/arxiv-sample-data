We introduce a new construction of a surface link in the 4-space. We construct a surface link as a branched covering over the standard torus, which we call a torus-covering link. We show that a certain torus-covering T^2-link is equivalent to the split union of spun T^2-links and turned spun T^2-links. We show that a certain torus-covering T^2-link has a non-classical link group. We give a certain class of ribbon torus-covering T^2-links. We present the quandle cocycle invariant of a certain torus-covering T^2-link obtained from a classical braid, by using the quandle cocycle invariants of the closure of the braid.
