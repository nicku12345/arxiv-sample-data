We give a short introduction to the theory of twisted Alexander polynomials of a 3--manifold associated to a representation of its fundamental group. We summarize their formal properties and we explain their relationship to twisted Reidemeister torsion. We then give a survey of the many applications of twisted invariants to the study of topological problems. We conclude with a short summary of the theory of higher order Alexander polynomials.
