Let T denote a binding component of an open book (\Sigma, \phi) compatible with a closed contact 3-manifold (M, \xi). We describe an explicit open book (\Sigma', \phi') compatible with (M, \zeta), where \zeta is the contact structure obtained from \xi by performing a full Lutz twist along T. Here, (\Sigma', \phi') is obtained from (\Sigma, \phi) by a \emph{local} modification near the binding.
