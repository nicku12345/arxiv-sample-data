A smooth curve \gamma: [0,1] \to S^2 is locally convex if its geodesic curvature is positive at every point. J. A. Little showed that the space of all locally positive curves \gamma with \gamma(0) = \gamma(1) = e_1 and \gamma'(0) = \gamma'(1) = e_2 has three connected components L_{-1,c}, L_{+1}, L_{-1,n}. The space L_{-1,c} is known to be contractible but the topology of the other two connected components is not well understood. We study the homotopy and cohomology of these spaces. In particular, for L_{-1} = L_{-1,c} \sqcup L_{-1,n}, we show that \dim H^{2k}(L_{(-1)^{k}}, \RR) \ge 1, that \dim H^{2k}(L_{(-1)^{(k+1)}}, \RR) \ge 2, that \pi_2(L_{+1}) contains a copy of Z^2 and that \pi_{2k}(L_{(-1)^{(k+1)}}) contains a copy of Z.
