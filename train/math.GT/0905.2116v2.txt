A smooth curve \gamma: [0,1] \to S^2 is locally convex if its geodesic curvature is positive at every point. J. A. Little showed that the space of all locally positive curves \gamma with \gamma(0) = \gamma(1) = e_1 and \gamma'(0) = \gamma'(1) = e_2 has three connected components L_{-1,c}, L_{+1}, L_{-1,n}. The space L_{-1,c} is known to be contractible but the topology of the other two connected components is not well understood. We prove that all connected components of L_I are simply connected, that H^2(L_{+1};Z) = Z^2 and H^2(L_{-1,n};Z) = Z.
