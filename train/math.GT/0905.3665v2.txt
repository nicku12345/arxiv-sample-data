In this paper we introduce a Jones-type invariant for singular knots, using a Markov trace on the Yokonuma--Hecke algebras {\rm Y}_{d,n}(u) and the theory of singular braids. The Yokonuma--Hecke algebras have a natural topological interpretation in the context of framed knots. Yet, we show that there is a homomorphism of the singular braid monoid SB_n into the algebra {\rm Y}_{d,n}(u). Surprisingly, the trace does not normalize directly to yield a singular link invariant, so a condition must be imposed on the trace variables. Assuming this condition, the invariant satisfies a skein relation involving singular crossings, which arises from a quadratic relation in the algebra {\rm Y}_{d,n}(u).
