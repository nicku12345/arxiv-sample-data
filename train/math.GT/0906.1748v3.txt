For \Gamma_1-structures on 3-manifolds, we give a very simple proof of Thurston's regularization theorem, first proved in \cite{thurston}, without using Mather's homology equivalence. Moreover, in the co-orientable case, the resulting foliation can be chosen of a precise kind, namely an "open book foliation modified by suspension." There is also a model in the non co-orientable case.
