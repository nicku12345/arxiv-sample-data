We exhibit the first examples of links which are homologically thin but not quasi-alternating. To show that they are not quasi-alternating, we argue that none of their branched double-covers bounds a negative definite 4-manifold with non-torsion H_1. Using this method, we also complete the determination of the quasi-alternating pretzel links.
