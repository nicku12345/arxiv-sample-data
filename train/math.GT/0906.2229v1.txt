In contrast with knots, whose properties depend only on their extrinsic topology in S^3, there is a rich interplay between the intrinsic structure of a graph and the extrinsic topology of all embeddings of the graph in S^3 . For example, it was shown in [2] that every embedding of the complete graph K_7 in S^3 contains a non-trivial knot. Later in it was shown that for every m \in N, there is a complete graph K_n such that every embedding of K_n in S_3 contains a knot Q whose minimal crossing number is at least m. Thus there are arbitrarily complicated knots in every embedding of a sufficiently large complete graph in S^3. We prove here the contrasting result that every graph has an embedding in S^3 such that every non-trivial knot in that embedding is hyperbolic. Our theorem implies that every graph has an embedding in S^3 which contains no composite or satellite knots.
