This article describes the following results which relate to each other; i) convergence of high dimensional contact structure to codimension one foliation with Reeb component, ii) relation between Nil-type and Sol-type contact submanifolds of S^5, iii) definition of convex Thurston-Bennequin inequality, and iv) generalization of Lutz twist via convex hypersurface theory. The other article concerning non-convex hypersurfaces is included as an appendix.
