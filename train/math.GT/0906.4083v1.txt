We show that every rational knot K of crossing number N admits a polynomial parametrization x=T_a(t), y = T_b(t), z = C(t) where T_k(t) are the Chebyshev polynomials, a=3 and b+ \deg C = 3N. We show that every rational knot also admits a polynomial parametrization with a=4. If C (t)= T_c(t) is a Chebyshev polynomial, we call such a knot a harmonic knot. We give the classification of harmonic knots for a \le 4.
