We construct new invariant polynomial for long virtual knots. It is a generalization of Alexander polynomial. We designate it by \zeta meaning an analogy with \zeta-polynomial for virtual links. A degree of \zeta-polynomial estimates a virtual crossing number. We describe some application of \zeta-polynomial for the study of minimal long virtual diagrams with respect number of virtual crossings.
