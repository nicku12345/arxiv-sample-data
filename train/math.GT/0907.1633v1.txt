Using the methods of the previous paper [ABG], we show that the Teichmuller space T of all closed Riemann surfaces is fibred twice over the Teichmuller space H of hyperelliptic ones. Both fibre bundles \pi_1,\pi_2:T->H are real algebraic (rational). They define an embedding T->HxH. In addition, we indicate slight modifications of the proof of [ABG, Theorem 5.1] providing an elementary proof of Toledo's rigidity theorem.
