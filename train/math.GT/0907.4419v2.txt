Let M=H_{+}\cup_{S} H_{-} be a genus g Heegaard splitting with Heegaard distance n\geq \kappa+2: (1) Let c_{1}, c_{2} be two slopes in the same component of \partial_{-}H_{-}, such that the natural Heegaard splitting M^{i}=H_{+}\cup_{S} (H_{-}\cup_{c_{i}} 2-handle) has distance less than n, then the distance of c_{1} and c_{2} in the curve complex of \partial_{-}H_{-} is at most 3\mathfrak{M}+2, where \kappa and \mathfrak{M} are constants due to Masur-Minsky. (2) Let M^{*} be the manifold obtained by attaching a collection of handlebodies \mathscr{H} to \partial_{-} H_{-} along a map f from \partial \mathscr{H} to \partial_{-} H_{-}. If f is a sufficiently large power of a generic pseudo-Anosov map, then the distance of the Heegaard splitting M^{*}=H_{+}\cup (H_{-}\cup_{f} \mathscr{H}) is still n. The proofs rely essentially on Masur-Minsky's theory of curve complex.
