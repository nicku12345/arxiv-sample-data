The study of geometric group theory has suggested several theorems related to subdivision tilings that have a natural hyperbolic structure. However, few examples exist. We construct subdivision tilings for the complement of every nonsingular, prime alternating link. These tilings define a combinatorial space at infinity, similar to the space at infinity for word hyperbolic groups.
