The space of closed subgroups of a locally compact topological group is endowed with a natural topology, called the Chabauty topology. Let X be a symmetric space of noncompact type, and G be its group of isometries. The space X identifies with the subspace of maximal compact subgroups of G : taking the closure gives rise to the Chabauty compactification of the symmetric space X. Using simpler arguments than those present in the book of Guivarc'h, Ji and Taylor, we describe the subgroups that appear in the boundary of the compactification.
