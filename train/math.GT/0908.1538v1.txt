In this paper, we investigate twist sequences for Kauffman finite-type invariants and Goussarov-Polyak-Viro finite-type invariants. It is shown that one obtains a Kauffman or GPV type of degree \le n if and only if an invariant is a polynomial of degree \le n on every twist lattice of the right form. The main result of this paper is an application of this technique to the coefficients of the Jones-Kauffman polynomial. It is shown that the Kauffman finite-type invariants obtained from these coefficients are not GPV finite-type invariants of any degree by explicitly showing they can never be polynomials. This generalizes a result of Kauffman, where it is known for degree k=2.
