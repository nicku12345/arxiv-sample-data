It has been conjectured that for knots K and K' in S^3, w(K#K')= w(K)+w(K')-2. Scharlemann and Thompson have proposed potential counterexamples to this conjecture. For every n, they proposed a family of knots {K^n_i} for which they conjectured that w(B^n#K^n_i)=w(K^n_i) where B^n is a bridge number n knot. We show that for n>2 none of the knots in {K^n_i} produces such counterexamples.
