First, we extend Otal's result for the trivial knot to trivial spatial graphs, namely, we show that for any bridge tangle decomposing sphere S^2 for a trivial spatial graph \Gamma, there exists a 2-sphere F such that F contains \Gamma and F intersects S^2 in a single loop.   Next, we introduce two invariants for spatial graphs. As a generalization of the bridge number for knots, we define the {\em bridge string number} bs(\Gamma) of a spatial graph \Gamma as the minimal number of |\Gamma\cap S^2| for all bridge tangle decomposing sphere S^2. As a spatial version of the representativity for a graph embedded in a surface, we define the {\em representativity} of a non-trivial spatial graph \Gamma as \[ r(\Gamma)=\max_{F\in\mathcal{F}} \min_{D\in\mathcal{D}_F} |\partial D\cap \Gamma|, \] where \mathcal{F} is the set of all closed surfaces containing \Gamma and \mathcal{D}_F is the set of all compressing disks for F in S^3. Then we show that for a non-trivial spatial graph \Gamma, \[ \displaystyle r(\Gamma)\le \frac{bs(\Gamma)}{2}. \] In particular, if \Gamma is a knot, then r(\Gamma)\le b(\Gamma), where b(\Gamma) denotes the bridge number. This generalizes Schubert's result on torus knots.
