In this paper, we compute the Khovanov homology over \Q for (p,-p,q) pretzel knots for odd values of p from 3 to 15 and arbitrarily large q. We provide a conjecture for the general form of the Khovanov homology of (p,-p,q) pretzel knots. These computations reveal that these knots have thin Khovanov homology (over \Q and \Z). Because Greene has shown that these knots are not quasi-alternating, this provides an infinite class of non-quasi-alternating knots with thin Khovanov homology.
