We show that every two-bridge knot K of crossing number N admits a polynomial parametrization x=T_3(t), y = T_b(t), z =C(t) where T_k(t) are the Chebyshev polynomials and b+\deg C = 3N. If C (t)= T_c(t) is a Chebyshev polynomial, we call such a knot a harmonic knot. We give the classification of harmonic knots for a \le 3. Most results are derived from continued fractions and their matrix representations.
