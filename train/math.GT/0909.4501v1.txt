We show that every hyperbolic link complement contains closed quasi-Fuchsian surfaces. As a consequence, we obtain the result that on a hyperbolic link complement, if we remove from each cusp of the manifold a certain finite set of slopes, then all remaining Dehn fillings on the link complement yield manifolds with closed immersed incompressible surfaces.
