A Riemann surface M is said to be K-quasiconformally homogeneous if for every two points p,q \in M, there exists a K-quasiconformal homeomorphism f \colon M \rightarrow M such that f(p) = q. In this paper, we show there exists a universal constant K_0 > 1 such that if M is a K-quasiconformally homogeneous hyperbolic genus zero surface other than the disk \mathbb{D}, then K \geq K_0. This answers a question by Gehring and Palka.
