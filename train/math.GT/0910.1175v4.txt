For a Lie group G=\R^{n}\ltimes_{\phi}\R^{m} with the semi-simple action \phi:\R^{n}\to {\rm Aut}(\R^{m}), we show that if \Gamma is a finite extension of a lattice of G then K(\Gamma, 1) is formal. Moreover we show that a compact symplectic aspherical manifold with the fundamental group \Gamma satisfies the hard Lefschetz property. By those results we give many examples of formal solvmanifolds satisfying the hard Lefschetz property but not admitting K\"ahler structures.
