We show that central extensions of the mapping class group M_g of the closed orientable surface of genus g by \Z are residually finite. Further we give rough estimates of the largest N=N_g such that homomorphisms from M_g to SU(N) have finite image. In particular, homomorphisms of M_g into SL([\sqrt{g+1}],\C) have finite image. Both results come from properties of quantum representations of mapping class groups.
