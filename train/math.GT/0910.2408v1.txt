If a hyperbolic 3-manifold M admits a reducible and a finite Dehn filling, the distance between the filling slopes is known to be 1. This has been proved recently by Boyer, Gordon and Zhang. The first example of a manifold with two such fillings was given by Boyer and Zhang. In this paper, we give examples of hyperbolic manifolds admitting a reducible Dehn filling and a finite Dehn filling of every type: cyclic, dihedral, tetrahedral, octahedral and icosahedral.
