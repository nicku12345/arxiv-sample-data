Embeddings of pairs of disjoint nonparallel primitive simple closed curves in the boundary of a genus two handlebody are classified. Briefly, two disjoint primitives either lie on opposite ends of a product F \boldsymbol{\times} I, or they lie on opposite ends of a kind of "twisted" product F \widetilde{\boldsymbol{\times}} I, where F is a once-punctured torus. If one of the curves is a proper power of a primitive, the situation is simpler. Either the curves lie on opposite sides of a separating disk in the handlebody, or they bound a nonseparating essential annulus in the handlebody.
