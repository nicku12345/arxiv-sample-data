Let T be a graph in a compact, orientable 3--manifold M and let \Gamma be a subgraph. T can be placed in bridge position with respect to a Heegaard surface H. We show that if H is what we call (T,\Gamma)-c-weakly reducible in the complement of T then either a "degenerate" situation occurs or H can be untelescoped and consolidated into a collection of "thick surfaces" and "thin surfaces". The thin surfaces are c-essential (c-incompressible and essential) in the graph exterior and each thick surface is a strongly irreducible bridge surface in the complement of the thin surfaces. This strengthens and extends previous results of Hayashi-Shimokawa and Tomova to graphs in 3-manifolds that may have non-empty boundary.
