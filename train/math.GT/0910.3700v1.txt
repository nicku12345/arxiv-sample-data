Aimed at geometric applications, we prove the homology cobordism invariance of the L^2-betti numbers and L^2-signature defects associated to the class of amenable groups lying in Strebel's class D(R), which includes some interesting infinite/finitenon-torsion-free groups. The proofs include the only prior known condition, that \Gamma is a poly-torsion-free abelian group (or potentially a finite p-group.) We define a new commutator-type series which refines Harvey's torsion-free derived series of groups, using the localizations of groups and rings of Bousfield, Vogel, and Cohn. The series, called the local derived series, has versions for homology with arbitrary coefficients, and satisfies functoriality and an injectivity theorem. We combine these two new tools to give some applications to distinct homology cobordism types within the same simple homotopy type in higher dimensions, to concordance of knots in three manifolds, and to spherical space forms in dimension three.
