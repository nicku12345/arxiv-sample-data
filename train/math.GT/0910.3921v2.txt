A gap in a paper of Rubinstein-Scharlemann is explored: new examples are found of closed orientable 3-manifolds with possibly multiple genus 2 Heegaard splittings. Properties common to all the examples in the original paper are not universally shared by the new examples: some of the new examples have Hempel distance 3, and it is not clear that a single stabilization always makes the multiple splittings isotopic.
