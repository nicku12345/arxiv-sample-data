Let \imath: M\to \RR^{p+2} be a smooth embedding from a connected, oriented, closed p-dimesional smooth manifold to \RR^{p+2}, then there is a spin structure \imath^\sharp(\varsigma^{p+2}) on M canonically induced from the embedding. If an orientation-preserving diffeomorphism \tau of M extends over \imath as an orientation-preserving topological homeomorphism of \RR^{p+2}, then \tau preserves the induced spin structure.   Let \esg_\cat(\imath) be the subgroup of the \cat-mapping class group \mcg_\cat(M) consisting of elements whose representatives extend over \RR^{p+2} as orientation-preserving \cat-homeomorphisms, where \cat=\topo, \pl or \diff. The invariance of \imath^\sharp(\varsigma^{p+2}) gives nontrivial lower bounds to [\mcg_\cat(M):\esg_\cat(\imath)] in various special cases. We apply this to embedded surfaces in \RR^4 and embedded p-dimensional tori in \RR^{p+2}. In particular, in these cases the index lower bounds for \esg_\topo(\imath) are achieved for unknotted embeddings.
