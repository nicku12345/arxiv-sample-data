We study diffeomorphisms of compact, oriented surfaces, developing methods of distinguishing those which have positive factorizations into Dehn twists from those which satisfy the weaker condition of right veering. We use these to construct open book decompositions of Stein-fillable 3-manifolds whose monodromies have no positive factorization.
