A Chebyshev knot {\cal C}(a,b,c,\phi) is a knot which has a parametrization of the form  x(t)=T_a(t); y(t)=T_b(t) ; z(t)= T_c(t + \phi),  where a,b,c are integers, T_n(t) is the Chebyshev polynomial of degree n and \phi \in \R. We show that any two-bridge knot is a Chebyshev knot with a=3 and also with a=4. For every a,b,c integers (a=3, 4 and a, b coprime), we describe an algorithm that gives all Chebyshev knots \cC(a,b,c,\phi). We deduce a list of minimal Chebyshev representations of two-bridge knots with small crossing number.
