The \log 3 Theorem, proved by Culler and Shalen, states that every point in the hyperbolic 3-space is moved a distance at least \log 3 by one of the non-commuting isometries \xi or \eta provided that \xi and \eta generate a torsion-free, discrete group which is not co-compact and contains no parabolic. This theorem lies in the foundation of many techniques that provide lower estimates for the volumes of orientable, closed hyperbolic 3-manifolds whose fundamental group has no 2-generator subgroup of finite index and, as a consequence, gives insights into the topological properties of these manifolds.   In this paper, we show that every point in the hyperbolic 3-space is moved a distance at least (1/2)\log(5+3\sqrt{2}) by one of the isometries in \{\xi,\eta,\xi\eta\} when \xi and \eta satisfy the conditions given in the \log 3 Theorem.
