In this paper, it is shown that a Fuchsian group, acting on the upper half-plane model for \mathbb{H}^2, admits a Ford domain which is also a Dirichlet domain, for some center, if and only if it is an index 2 subgroup of a reflection group. This is used to exhibit an example of a maximal arithmetic hyperbolic reflection group which is not congruence. Analogous results, and counterexamples, are given in the case of Kleinian groups.
