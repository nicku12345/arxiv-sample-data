Let M be a 3-manifold with torus boundary components T_1 and T_2. Let \phi \colon T_1 \to T_2 be a homeomorphism, M_\phi the manifold obtained from M by gluing T_1 to T_2 via the map \phi, and T the image of T_1 in M_\phi. We show that if \phi is "sufficiently complicated" then any incompressible or strongly irreducible surface in M_\phi can be isotoped to be disjoint from T. It follows that every Heegaard splitting of a 3-manifold admitting a "sufficiently complicated" JSJ decomposition is an amalgamation of Heegaard splittings of the components of the JSJ decomposition.
