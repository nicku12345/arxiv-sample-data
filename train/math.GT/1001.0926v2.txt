The twisted torsion of a 3-manifold is well-known to be zero whenever the corresponding twisted Alexander module is non-torsion. Under mild extra assumptions we introduce a new twisted torsion invariant which is always non-zero. We show how this torsion invariant relates to the twisted intersection form of a bounding 4-manifold, generalizing a theorem of Milnor. Using this result, we give new obstructions to 3-manifolds being homology cobordant and to links being concordant. These obstructions are sufficiently strong to detect that the Bing double of the figure eight knot is not slice.
