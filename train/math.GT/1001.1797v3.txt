We construct a cohomology theory for oriented links using singular cobordisms and a special type of 2-dimensional Topological Quantum Field Theory (TQFT), categorifying the quantum sl(2) invariant. In particular, we give a description of the universal dot-free sl(2) foam cohomology for links via a TQFT.
