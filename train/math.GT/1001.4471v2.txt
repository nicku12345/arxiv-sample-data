In this paper we introduce the framed pure braid group on n strands of an oriented surface, a topological generalisation of the pure braid group P_n. We give different equivalents definitions for framed pure braid groups and we study exact sequences relating these groups with other generalisations of P_n, usually called surface pure braid groups. The notion of surface framed braid groups is also introduced.
