We give formulas expressing Milnor invariants of an n-component link L in the 3-sphere in terms of the HOMFLYPT polynomial as follows. If the Milnor invariant \bar{\mu}_J(L) vanishes for any sequence J with length at most k, then any Milnor \bar{\mu}-invariant \bar{\mu}_I(L) with length between 3 and 2k+1 can be represented as a combination of HOMFLYPT polynomial of knots obtained from the link by certain band sum operations. In particular, the `first non vanishing' Milnor invariants can be always represented as such a linear combination.
