Let P, Q be Heegaard surfaces of a closed orientable 3-manifold. In this paper, we introduce a method for giving an upper bound of Hempel distance of P by using the Reeb graph derived from a certain horizontal arc in the ambient space [0,1]\times[0,1] of the Rubinstein-Scharlemann graphic derived from P and Q. This is a refinement of a part of Johnson's arguments used for determining stable genera required for flipping high distance Heegaard splittings.
