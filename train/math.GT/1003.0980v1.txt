We introduce Fenchel-Nielsen coordinates on Teicm\"uller spaces of surfaces of infinite type. The definition is relative to a given pair of pants decomposition of the surface. We start by establishing conditions under which any pair of pants decomposition on a hyperbolic surface of infinite type can be turned into a geometric decomposition, that is, a decomposition into hyperbolic pairs of pants. This is expressed in terms of a condition we introduce and which we call Nielsen convexity. This condition is related to Nielsen cores of Fuchsian groups. We use this to define the Fenchel-Nielsen Teichm\"uller space associated to a geometric pair of pants decomposition. We study a metric on such a Teichm\"uller space, and we compare it to the quasiconformal Teichm\"uller space, equipped with the Teichm\"uller metric. We study conditions under which there is an equality between these Teichm\"uller spaces and we study topological and metric properties of the identity map when this map exists.
