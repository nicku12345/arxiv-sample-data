Let D(p,q) be the usual knot diagram of the (p,q)-torus knot, that is, D(p,q) is the closure of the p-braid (\sigma_1^{-1} \sigma_2^{-1}... \sigma_{p-1}^{-1})^q. As is well-known, D(p,q) and D(q,p) represent the same knot. It is shown that D(n+1,n) can be deformed to D(n,n+1) by a sequence of \{(n-1)n(2n-1)/6 \} + 1 Reidemeister moves, which consists of a single RI move and (n-1)n(2n-1)/6 RIII moves. Using cowrithe, we show that this sequence is minimal over all sequences which bring D(n+1,n) to D(n,n+1).
