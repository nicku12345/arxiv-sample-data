This paper gives a new obstruction for ribbon-move equivalence of 2-knots.   Let K and K' be 2-knots. Let K and K' are ribbon-move equivalent. One corollary to our main theorem is as follows. A 2-dimensional fibered knot whose fiber is the punctured 3-dimensional torus is not ribbon-move equivalent to any 2-dimensional knot whose Seifert hypersurface is a punctured homology sphere.
