We prove that there is an algorithm which determines whether or not a given 2-polyhedron can be embedded into some integral homology 3-sphere.   This is a corollary of the following main result. Let M be a compact connected orientable 3-manifold with boundary. Denote G=\Z, G=\Z/p\Z or G=\Q. If H_1(M;G)\cong G^k and \bd M is a surface of genus g, then the minimal group H_1(Q;G) for closed 3-manifolds Q containing M is isomorphic to G^{k-g}.   Another corollary is that for a graph L the minimal number \rk H_1(Q;\Z) for closed orientable 3-manifolds Q containing L\times S^1 is twice the orientable genus of the graph.
