By using Klein's model for hyperbolic geometry, hyperbolic structures on orbifolds or manifolds provide examples of real projective structures. By Andreev's theorem, many 3-dimensional reflection orbifolds admit a finite volume hyperbolic structure, and such a hyperbolic structure is unique. However, the induced real projective structure on some such 3-orbifolds deforms into a family of real projective structures that are not induced from hyperbolic structures. In this paper, we find new classes of compact and complete hyperbolic reflection 3-orbifolds with such deformations. We also explain numerical and exact results on projective deformations of some compact hyperbolic cubes and dodecahedra.
