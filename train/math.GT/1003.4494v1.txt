In this paper, we introduce playing games on shadows of knots. We demonstrate two novel games, namely, To Knot or Not to Knot and Much Ado about Knotting. We also discuss winning strategies for these games on certain families of knot shadows. Finally, we suggest variations of these games for further study.
