This article will explore the K- and L-theory of group rings and their applications to algebra, geometry and topology. The Farrell-Jones Conjecture characterizes K- and L-theory groups. It has many implications, including the Borel and Novikov Conjectures for topological rigidity. Its current status, and many of its consequences are surveyed.
