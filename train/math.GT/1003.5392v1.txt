A homogeneous knot is a generalization of alternating knots and positive knots. We determine the Rasmussen invariant of a homogeneous knot. This is a new class of knots such that the Rasmussen invariant is explicitly described in terms of its diagrams. As a corollary, we obtain some characterizations of a positive knot. In particular, we recover Baader's theorem which states that a knot is positive if and only if it is homogeneous and strongly quasipositive.
