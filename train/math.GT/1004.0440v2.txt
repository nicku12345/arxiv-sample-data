This survey paper contains an elementary exposition of Casson and Rivin's technique for finding the hyperbolic metric on a 3-manifold M with toroidal boundary. We also survey a number of applications of this technique.   The method involves subdividing M into ideal tetrahedra and solving a system of gluing equations to find hyperbolic shapes for the tetrahedra. The gluing equations decompose into a linear and non-linear part. The solutions to the linear equations form a convex polytope A. The solution to the non-linear part (unique if it exists) is a critical point of a certain volume functional on this polytope. The main contribution of this paper is an elementary proof of Rivin's theorem that a critical point of the volume functional on A produces a complete hyperbolic structure on M.
