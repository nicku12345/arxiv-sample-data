Given any unoriented link diagram, a group of new knot invariants are constructed. Each of them satisfies a generalized 4 term skein relation. The coefficients of each invariant is from a commutative ring. Homomorphisms and representations of such a ring defines new link invariants. In this sense, they produce the well-known Kauffman bracket, the Kauffman 2-variable polynomial, and the Q-polynomial.
