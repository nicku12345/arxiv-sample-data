We show that for a representation of the fundamental group of a triangulated closed 3-manifold (not necessarily hyperbolic) into \PSL so that any edge loop has non-trivial image under the representation, there exist uncountably many solutions to the hyperbolic gluing equation whose associated representations are conjugate to the given representation, and whose volumes are equal to the volume of the given representation.
