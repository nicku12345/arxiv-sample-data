Knot Floer homology is an invariant for knots in the three-sphere for which the Euler characteristic is the Alexander-Conway polynomial of the knot. The aim of this paper is to study this homology for a class of satellite knots, so as to see how a certain relation between the Alexander-Conway polynomials of the satellite, companion and pattern is generalized on the level of the knot Floer homology. We also use our observations to study a classical geometric invariant, the Seifert genus, of our satellite knots.
