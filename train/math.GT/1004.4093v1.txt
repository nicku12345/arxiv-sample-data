Let M and N be Nash manifolds, and f and g Nash maps from M to N. If M and N are compact and if f and g are analytically R-L equivalent, then they are Nash R-L equivalent. In the local case, C^infty R-L equivalence of two Nash map germs implies Nash R-L equivalence. This shows a difference of Nash map germs and analytic map germs. Indeed, there are two analytic map germs from (R^2,0) to (R^4,0) which are C^infty R-L equivalent but not analytically R-L equivalent.
