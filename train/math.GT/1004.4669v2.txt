We show that given a partially flat angled ideal triangulation for a 3-manifold M with boundary (as defined by Lackenby), there is an algorithm to produce a list of Heegaard splittings for M such that below a given genus g, each isotopy class appears exactly once. In particular, this algorithm determines precisely when two almost normal surfaces represent Heegaard splittings that are isotopic in the ambient 3-manifold. A closely related algorithm determines the smallest genus common stabilization of any two Heegaard splittings on the list. The methods, in fact, characterize isotopies between Heegaard surfaces in any triangulation, but the existence of infinitely many normal surfaces of the same genus prevents this characterization from being algorithmic in general.
