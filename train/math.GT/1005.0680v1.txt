If M is a manifold with compressible boundary, we analyze essential disks in M, as well as incompressible, but not necessarily boundary incompressible, surfaces in M. We are most interested in the case where M is a handlebody or compression body. The analysis depends on a new normal surface theory. We hope the normal surface theory will be used in other papers to describe objects representing limits of essential disks in a handlebody or a 3-manifold with compressible boundary. For certain automorphisms of handlebodies, these disk limits should serve as invariant objects akin to laminations and analogous to the invariant laminations for pseudo-Anosov automorphisms of surfaces.
