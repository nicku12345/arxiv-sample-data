We obtain relations among the characteristic classes of a manifold M admitting corank one maps. Our relations yield strong restrictions on the cobordism class of M and also nonexistence results for singular maps of the projective spaces. We obtain our results through blowing up a manifold along the singular set of a smooth map and perturbing the arising non-generic corank one map.
