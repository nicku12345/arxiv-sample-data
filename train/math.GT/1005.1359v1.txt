We develop a construction suggested by Scharlemann and Thompson to obtain an infinite family of pairs of knots K_{\alpha} and K'_{\alpha} so that w(K_{\alpha} # K'_{\alpha})=max{w(K_{\alpha}), w(K'_{\alpha})}. This is the first known example of a pair of knots such that w(K#K')<w(K)+w(K')-2 and it establishes that the lower bound w(K#K')\geq max{w(K),w(K')} obtained by Scharlemann and Schultens is best possible. Furthermore, the knots K_{\alpha} provide an example of knots where the number of critical points for the knot in thin position is greater than the number of critical points for the knot in bridge position.
