We show that the perturbative {\frak g} invariant of rational homology 3-spheres can be recovered from the LMO invariant for any simple Lie algebra {\frak g}, i.e, the LMO invariant is universal among the perturbative invariants. This universality was conjectured in [25]. Since the perturbative invariants dominate the quantum invariants of integral homology 3-spheres [13,14,15], this implies that the LMO invariant dominates the quantum invariants of integral homology 3-spheres.
