We show that the conjectural cusped complex hyperbolic 2-orbifolds of minimal volume are the two smallest arithmetic complex hyperbolic 2-orbifolds. We then show that every arithmetic cusped complex hyperbolic 2-manifold of minimal volume covers one of these two orbifolds. We also give all minimal volume manifolds that simultaneously cover both minimal orbifolds.
