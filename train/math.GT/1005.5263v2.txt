In a recent work "Arc-presentation of links: Monotonic simplification" Ivan Dynnikov showed that each rectangular diagram of the unknot, composite link, or split link can be monotonically simplified into a trivial, composite, or split diagram, respectively. The following natural question arises: Is it always possible to simplify monotonically a rectangular diagram of a satellite knot or link into one where the satellite structure is seen? Here we give a negative answer to that question.
