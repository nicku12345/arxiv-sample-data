We investigate the filtered theory corresponding to the universal sl(2) foam cohomology H_{a,h} for links, where a and h are complex numbers. We show that there is a spectral sequence converging to H_{a,h} which is invariant under the Reidemeister moves, and whose E1 term is isomorphic to Khovanov homology. This spectral sequence can be used to obtain from the foam perspective an analogue of the Rasmussen invariant and a lower bound for the slice genus of a knot.
