We construct sequences of pseudo-Anosov mapping classes whose dilatations behave asymptotically like the inverse of the Euler characteristic of the surface they are defined on. These sequences are used to show that if the genus, g, and punctures, n, of a surface are related by a rational ray g=rn then the minimal dilatations behave asymptotically like the inverse of the Euler characteristic.
