We study compatible contact structures of fibered, positively-twisted graph multilinks in the 3-sphere and prove that the contact structure of such a multilink is tight if and only if the orientations of its link components are all consistent with or all opposite to the orientation of the fibers of the Seifert fibrations of that graph multilink. As a corollary, we show that the compatible contact structures of the Milnor fibrations of real analytic germs of the form (f\bar g,O) are always overtwisted.
