In this paper, we show that any knot group maps onto at most finitely many knot groups. This gives an affirmative answer to a conjecture of J. Simon. We also bound the diameter of a closed hyperbolic 3-manifold linearly in terms of the presentation length of its fundamental group, improving a result of White.
