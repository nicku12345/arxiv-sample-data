Consider a 3-dimensional manifold N obtained by gluing a finite number of ideal hyperbolic tetrahedra via isometries along their faces. By varying the isometry type of each tetrahedron but keeping fixed the gluing pattern we define a space \mathcal{T} of complete hyperbolic metrics on N with cone singularities along the edges of the tetrahedra. We prove that \mathcal{T} is homeomorphic to a Euclidean space and we compute its dimension. By means of examples, we examine if the elements of % \mathcal{T} are uniquely determined by the angles around the edges of N.
