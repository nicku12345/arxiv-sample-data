We give the rectangle condition for strong irreducibility of Heegaard splittings of 3-manifolds with non-empty boundary. We apply this to a generalized Heegaard splitting of a 2-fold covering of S^3 branched along a link. The condition implies that any thin meridional level surface in the link complement is incompressible. We also show that the additivity of knot width holds for a composite knot satisfying the condition.
