We use bordered Heegaard Floer homology to compute the tau invariant of a family of satellite knots obtained via twisted infection along two components of the Borromean rings, a generalization of Whitehead doubling. We show that tau of the resulting knot depends only on the two twisting parameters and the values of tau for the two companion knots. We also include some notes on bordered Heegaard Floer homology that may serve as a useful introduction to the subject.
