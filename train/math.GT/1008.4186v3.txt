Let M be a closed 4-manifold with \pi_2(M)\cong{Z}. Then M is homotopy equivalent to either CP^2, or the total space of an orbifold bundle with general fibre S^2 over a 2-orbifold B, or the total space of an RP^2-bundle over an aspherical surface. If \pi=\pi_1(M)\not=1 there are at most two such bundle spaces with given action u:\pi\to{Aut}(\pi_2(M)). The bundle space has the geometry \mathbb{S}^2\times\mathbb{E}^2 (if \chi(M)=0) or \mathbb{S}^2\times\mathbb{H}^2 (if \chi(M)<0), except when B is orientable and \pi is generated by involutions, in which case the action is unique and there is one non-geometric orbifold bundle.
