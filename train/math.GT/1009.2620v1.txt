The vector space \V generated by the conjugacy classes in the fundamental group of an orientable surface has a natural Lie cobracket \map{\delta}{\V}{\V\times \V}. For negatively curved surfaces, \delta can be computed from a geodesic representative as a sum over transversal self-intersection points. In particular \delta is zero for any power of an embedded simple closed curve. Denote by Turaev(k) the statement that \delta(x^k) = 0 if and only if the nonpower conjugacy class x is represented by an embedded curve. Computer implementation of the cobracket delta unearthed counterexamples to Turaev(1) on every surface with negative Euler characteristic except the pair of pants. Computer search have verified Turaev(2) for hundreds of millions of the shortest classes. In this paper we prove Turaev(k) for k=3,4,5,\dots for surfaces with boundary. Turaev himself introduced the cobracket in the 80's and wondered about the relation with embedded curves, in particular asking if Turaev (1) might be true.   We give an application of our result to the curve complex. We show that a permutation of the set of free homotopy classes that commutes with the cobracket and the power operation is induced by an element of the mapping class group.
