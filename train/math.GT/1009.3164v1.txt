Cha and Kim proved that if a knot K is not algebraically slice, then no iterated Bing double of K is concordant to the unlink. We prove that if K has nontrivial signature \sigma, then the n-iterated Bing double of K is not concordant to any boundary link with boundary surfaces of genus less than 2^{n-1}\sigma. The same result holds with \sigma replaced by 2\tau, twice the Ozsvath-Szabo knot concordance invariant.
