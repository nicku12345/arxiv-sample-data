We introduce a variant of the Seiberg-Witten equations, Pin^-(2)-monopole equations, and give its applications to intersection forms with local coefficients of 4-manifolds. The first application is an analogue of Froyshov's results on 4-manifolds which have definite forms with local coefficients. The second is a local coefficient version of Furuta's 10/8-inequality. As a corollary, we construct nonsmoothable spin 4-manifolds satisfying Rohlin's theorem and the 10/8-inequality.
