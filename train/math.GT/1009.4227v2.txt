In this note, we introduce a class of cell decompositions of PL manifolds and polyhedra which are more general than triangulations yet not as general as CW complexes; we propose calling them PLCW complexes. The main result is an analog of Alexander's theorem: any two PLCW decompositions of the same polyhedron can be obtained from each other by a sequence of certain "elementary" moves.   This definition is motivated by the needs of Topological Quantum Field Theory, especially extended theories as defined by Lurie.
