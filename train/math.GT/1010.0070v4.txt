In this paper, we study the topology of the boundaries of quasi-Fuchsian spaces. We first show for a given convergent sequence of quasi-Fuchsian groups, how we can know the end invariant of the limit group from the information on the behaviour of conformal structures at infinity of the groups. This result gives rise to a sufficient condition for divergence of quasi-Fuchsian groups, which generalises Ito's result in the once-punctured torus case to higher genera. We further show that quasi-Fuchsian groups can approach a b-group not along Bers slices only when the limit has isolated parabolic loci. This makes it possible to give a necessary condition for points on the boundaries of quasi-Fuchsian spaces to be self-bumping points. We use model manifolds invented by Minsky and their geometric limits studied by Ohshika-Soma to prove these results. This paper has been made as self-contained as possible so that the reader does not need to consult the paper of Ohshika-Soma directly.
