The paper presents a new set of axioms of digital topology, which are easily understandable for application developers. They define a class of locally finite (LF) topological spaces. An important property of LF spaces satisfying the axioms is that the neighborhood relation is antisymmetric and transitive. Therefore any connected and non-trivial LF space is isomorphic to an abstract cell complex. The paper demonstrates that in an n-dimensional digital space only those of the (a, b)-adjacencies commonly used in computer imagery have analogs among the LF spaces, in which a and b are different and one of the adjacencies is the "maximal" one, corresponding to 3n\"i1 neighbors. Even these (a, b)-adjacencies have important limitations and drawbacks. The most important one is that they are applicable only to binary images. The way of easily using LF spaces in computer imagery on standard orthogonal grids containing only pixels or voxels and no cells of lower dimensions is suggested.
