Nielsen reduction is an algorithm which decomposes any automorphism of a free group into a product of elementary Nielsen transformations. While this may be applied to a mapping class of a surface S_{g,1} with one boundary component, the resulting decomposition in general will not have a topological interpretation. In this survey, we discuss a variation called fatgraph Nielsen reduction which decomposes such a mapping class into elementary Nielsen transformations interpreted as rearrangements of polygon domains for S_{g,1} described by systems of arcs in S_{g,1}. These elementary moves generate the chord slide groupoid of S_{g,1}, which we survey and describe in terms of generators and relations.
