This paper analyzes commensurability of the class of surface automorphism generated by two Dehn multitwists. We show pairwise noncommensurability between several classes arising from canonical curve configurations. In addition, we consider the Kenyon-Smillie invariant J of flat surfaces in this setting. We also introduce a general construction of infinite classes of commensurable pseudo-Anosov homeomorphisms.
