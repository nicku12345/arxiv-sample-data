The WRT invariant of a link L in S2xS1 at sufficiently high values of the level r can be expresses as an evaluation of a special polynomial invariant of L at 2r-th root of unity. We categorify this polynomial invariant by associating to L a bigraded homology whose graded Euler characteristic is equal to this polynomial. If L is presented as a closure of a tangle in S2xS1, then the homology of L is defined as the Hochschild homology of the H_n-bimodule associated to the tangle by M. Khovanov. This homology can also be expressed as a stable limit of Khovanov homology of the circular closure of the tangle in S3 through the torus braid with high twist.
