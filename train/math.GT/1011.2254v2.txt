We generalize the works of Lee [arXiv:math/0210213v3] and Gornik [arXiv:math/0402266v2] to construct a basis for generic deformations of the colored sl(N)-homology defined in [arXiv:1002.2662v1]. As applications, we construct non-degenerate pairings and co-pairings which lead to dualities of generic deformations of the colored sl(N)-homology. We also define and study colored sl(N)-Rasmussen invariants. Among other things, we observe that these invariants vanish on amphicheiral knots and discuss some implications of this observation.
