We give a direct interpretation of Neumann's combinatorial formula for the Chern-Simons invariant of a 3-manifold with a representation in PSL(2,C) whose restriction to the boundary takes values in upper triangular matrices. Our construction does not involve group homology or Bloch group but is based on the construction of an explicit flat connection for each tetrahedron of a simplicial decomposition of the manifold.
