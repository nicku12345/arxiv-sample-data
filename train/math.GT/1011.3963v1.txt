Arnold introduced invariants J^+, J^- and St for generic planar curves.   It is known that both J^+ /2 + St and J^- /2 + St are invariants for generic spherical curves.   Applying these invariants to underlying curves of knot diagrams, we can obtain lower bounds for the number of Reidemeister moves for uknotting.   J^- /2 + St works well for unmatched RII moves.   However, it works only by halves for RI moves.   Let w denote the writhe for a knot diagram.   We show that J^- /2 + St \pm w/2 works well also for RI moves, and demonstrate that it gives a precise estimation for a certain knot diagram of the unknot with the underlying curve r = 2 + \cos (n \theta/(n+1)),\ (0 \le \theta \le 2(n+1)\pi).
