In the study of homology cobordisms, knot concordance and link concordance, the following technical problem arises frequently: let \pi be a group and let M \to N be a homomorphism between projective \Z[\pi]-modules such that \Z_p \otimes_{\Z[\pi]} M\to \Z_p \otimes_{\Z[\pi]} N is injective; for which other right \Z[\pi]-modules V is the induced map V \otimes_{\Z[\pi]} M\to V\otimes_{\Z[\pi]}N also injective? Our main theorem gives a new criterion which combines and generalizes many previous results.
