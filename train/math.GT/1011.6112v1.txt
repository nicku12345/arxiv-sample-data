The singularity set of a generic standard projection to the three space of a closed surface linked in four space, consists of at most three types: double points, triple points or branch points. We say that this generic projection image is p-diagram if it does not contain any triple point. Two p-diagrams of equivalent surface links are called p-equivalent if there exists a finite sequence of local moves, such that each of them is one of the four moves taken from the seven on the well known Roseman list, that connects only p-diagrams. It is natural to ask: are any of two p-diagrams of equivalent surface links always p-equivalent? We introduce an invariant of p-equivalent diagrams and an example of linked surfaces that answers our question negatively.
