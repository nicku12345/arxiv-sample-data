In this paper we are interested in the stratum H^{hyp}(4) of translation surfaces, which consists of pairs (M,\omega), where M is a hyper-elliptic Riemann surface of genus 3, and \omega is a holopmorphic 1-form on M having only one zero. We first show that every surface in this stratum can be decomposed into parallelograms following a unique model. We then single out a condition on this decomposition, and show that if this condition is satisfied then the SL(2,R) orbit of the surface is dense in the stratum. Using this criterion, we show that there are generic surfaces in this stratum with coordinates in any quadratic field, and that surfaces arising from the Thurston-Veech construction with cubic trace field can be generic.
