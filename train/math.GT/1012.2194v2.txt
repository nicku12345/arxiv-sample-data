Let \mathcal{G}^*(S,\rho) be the graph whose vertices are marked complex projective structures with holonomy \rho and whose edges are graftings from one vertex to another. If \rho is quasi-Fuchsian, a theorem of Goldman implies that \mathcal{G}^*(S,\rho) is connected. If \rho(\pi_1(S)) is a Schottky group Baba has shown that \mathcal{G}(S,\rho) (the corresponding graph for unmarked structures) is connected. For the case that \rho(\pi_1(S)) is a Schottky group, this paper provides formulae for the composition of graftings in a basic setting. Using these formulae, one can construct an infinite number of (standard) projective structures which can be grafted to a common structure. Furthermore, one can construct pairs of projective structures which can be connected by grafting in an infinite number of ways.
