We give a construction of quandle cocycles from group cocycles, especially, for any integer p \geq 3, quandle cocycles of the dihedral quandle R_p from group cocycles of the cyclic group Z/p. We will show that a group 3-cocycle of Z/p gives rise to a non-trivial quandle 3-cocycle of R_p. When p is an odd prime, since dim_{F_p} H_Q^3(R_p; F_p) = 1, our 3-cocycle is a constant multiple of the Mochizuki 3-cocycle up to coboundary. Dually, we construct a group cycle represented by a cyclic branched covering branched along a knot K from the quandle cycle associated with a colored diagram of K.
