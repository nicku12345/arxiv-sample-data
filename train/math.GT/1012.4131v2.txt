Using unknotting number, we introduce a link diagram invariant of Hass and Nowik type, which changes at most by 2 under a Reidemeister move.   As an application, we show that a certain infinite sequence of diagrams of the trivial two-component link need quadratic number of Reidemeister moves for being unknotted with respect to the number of crossings.   Assuming a certain conjecture on unknotting numbers of a certain series of composites of torus knots, we show that the above diagrams need quadratic number of Reidemeister moves for being splitted.
