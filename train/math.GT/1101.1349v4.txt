We show that the A-polynomial A_n of the 1-parameter family of pretzel knots K_n=(-2,3,3+2n) satisfies a linear recursion relation of order 4 with explicit constant coefficients and initial conditions. Our proof combines results of Tamura-Yokota and the second author. As a corollary, we show that the A-polynomial of K_n and the mirror of K_{-n} are related by an explicit \GL(2,\BZ) action. We leave open the question of whether or not this action lifts to the quantum level.
