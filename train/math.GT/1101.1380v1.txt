In this note we introduce certain invariants of real Lefschetz fibrations. We call these invariants {\em real Lefschetz chains}. We prove that if the fiber genus is greater than 1, then the real Lefschetz chains are complete invariants of real Lefschetz fibrations with only real critical values. If however the fiber genus is 1, real Lefschetz chains are not sufficient to distinguish real Lefschetz fibrations. We show that by adding a certain binary decoration to real Lefschetz chains, we get a complete invariant.
