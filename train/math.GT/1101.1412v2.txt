We give a geometric proof of the following result of Juhasz. \emph{Let a_g be the leading coefficient of the Alexander polynomial of an alternating knot K. If |a_g|<4 then K has a unique minimal genus Seifert surface.} In doing so, we are able to generalise the result, replacing `minimal genus' with `incompressible' and `alternating' with `homogeneous'. We also examine the implications of our proof for alternating links in general.
