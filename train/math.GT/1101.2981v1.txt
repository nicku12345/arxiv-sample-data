We use surgery along 2-tori embedded in a union of two copies of a product of punctured 2-tori to produce a new collection of homotopy 4-spheres (4-manifolds homotopy equivalent to S^4 and hence homeomorphic to S^4 but possibly not diffeomorphic to S^4). It is still unknown if these new examples are in fact exotic.
