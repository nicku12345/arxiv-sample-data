We introduce the k-stellated spheres and compare and contrast them with k-stacked spheres. It is shown that for d \geq 2k, any k-stellated sphere of dimension d bounds a unique and canonically defined k-stacked ball. In parallel, any k-stacked polytopal sphere of dimension d\geq 2k bounds a unique and canonically defined k-stacked ball. We consider the class {\cal W}_k(d) of combinatorial d-manifolds with k-stellated links. For d\geq 2k+2, any member of {\cal W}_k(d) bounds a unique and canonically defined "k-stacked" (d+1)-manifold.   We introduce the mu-vector of simplicial complexes, and show that the mu-vector of any 2-neighbourly simplicial complex dominates its vector of Betti numbers componentwise, and the two vectors are equal precisely when the complex is tight. When d\geq 2k, we are able to estimate/compute certain alternating sums of the mu-numbers of any 2-neighbourly member of {\cal W}_k(d). This leads to a lower bound theorem for such triangulated manifolds. As an application, it is shown that any (k+1)-neighbourly member of {\cal W}_k(d) is tight, subject only to an extra condition on the k^{th} Betti number in case d=2k+1. This result more or less settles a recent conjecture of Effenberger, and it also provides a uniform and conceptual tightness proof for all the known tight triangulated manifolds, with only two exceptions. It is shown that any polytopal upper bound sphere of odd dimension 2k+1 belongs to the class {\cal W}_k(2k+1), thus generalizing a theorem due to Perles. This shows that the case d=2k+1 is indeed exceptional for the tightness theorem.
