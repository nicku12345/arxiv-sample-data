We show the triviality of representations of the mapping class group of a genus g surface in GL(n,C), Diff(S^2) and Homeo(T^2) when appropriate restrictions on the genus g and the size of n hold. For example, if S_g is a surface of finite type and \phi : MCG(S_g) \to GL(n,C) is a homomorphism, then \phi is trivial provided the genus g \ge 3 and n < 2g. We also show that if S_g is a closed surface with genus g \ge 7, then every homomorphism \phi: MCG(S_g) \to Diff(S^2) is trivial and that if g \ge 3, then every homomorphism \phi: MCG(S_g) \to Homeo(T^2) is trivial.
