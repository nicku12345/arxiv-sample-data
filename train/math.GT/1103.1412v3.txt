Given a knot, we ask how its Khovanov and Khovanov-Rozansky homologies change under the operation of introducing twists in a pair of strands. We obtain long exact sequences in homology and further algebraic structure which is then used to derive topological and computational results. Two of our applications include giving a new way to generate arbitrary numbers of knots with isomorphic homologies and finding an infinite number of mutant knot pairs with isomorphic reduced homologies.
