If there are any 2-component counterexamples to the Generalized Property R Conjecture, a least genus component of all such counterexamples cannot be a fibered knot. Furthermore, the monodromy of a fibered component of any such counterexample has unexpected restrictions.   The simplest plausible counterexample to the Generalized Property R Conjecture could be a 2-component link containing the square knot. We characterize all two-component links that contain the square knot and which surger to (S^1 x S^2) # (S^1 x S^2). We exhibit a family of such links that are probably counterexamples to Generalized Property R. These links can be used to generate slice knots that are not known to be ribbon.
