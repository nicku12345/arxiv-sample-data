We show that there are links whose individual components are concordant to the unknot, but which are not concordant to any link with unknotted components. We give examples in the topological category, and examples in the smooth category which are topologically slice. We also give generalizations regarding components of prescribed Alexander polynomials. The main tools are covering link calculus, algebraic invariants of rational knot concordance theory, and the correction term of Heegaard Floer homology.
