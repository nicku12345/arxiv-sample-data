Conway-Gordon proved that for every spatial complete graph on 6 vertices, the sum of the linking numbers over all of the constituent 2-component links is congruent to 1 modulo 2, and for every spatial complete graph on 7 vertices, the sum of the Arf invariants over all of the Hamiltonian knots is also congruent to 1 modulo 2. In this paper, we give a Conway-Gordon type theorem for any graph which is obtained from the complete graph on 6 or 7 vertices by a finite sequence of \triangle Y-exchanges.
