Let C be a curve in a closed orientable surface F of genus g \geq 2 that separates F into subsurfaces \widetilde {F_i} of genera g_i, for i = 1,2. We study the set of roots in \Mod(F) of the Dehn twist t_C about C. All roots arise from pairs of C_{n_i}-actions on the \widetilde{F_i}, where n=\lcm(n_1,n_2) is the degree of the root, that satisfy a certain compatibility condition. The C_{n_i} actions are of a kind that we call nestled actions, and we classify them using tuples that we call data sets. The compatibility condition can be expressed by a simple formula, allowing a classification of all roots of t_C by compatible pairs of data sets. We use these data set pairs to classify all roots for g = 2 and g = 3. We show that there is always a root of degree at least 2g^2+2g, while n \leq 4g^2+2g. We also give some additional applications.
