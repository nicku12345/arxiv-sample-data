We denote by Q_F the family of the Alexander quandle structures supported by finite fields. For every k-component oriented link L, every partition P of L into h:=|P| sublinks, and every labelling z of such a partition by the natural numbers z_1,...,z_n, the number of X-colorings of any diagram of (L,z) is a well-defined invariant of (L,P), of the form q^(a_X(L,P,z)+1) for some natural number a_X(L,P,z). Letting X and z vary in Q_F and among the labellings of P, we define a derived invariant A_Q(L,P)=sup a_X(L,P,z).   If P_M is such that |P_M|=k, we show that A_Q(L,P_M) is a lower bound for t(L), where t(L) is the tunnel number of L. If P is a "boundary partition" of L and g(L,P) denotes the infimum among the sums of the genera of a system of disjoint Seifert surfaces for the L_j's, then we show that A_Q(L,P) is at most 2g(L,P)+2k-|P|-1. We set A_Q(L):=A_Q(L,P_m), where |P_m|=1. By elaborating on a suitable version of a result by Inoue, we show that when L=K is a knot then A_Q(K) is bounded above by A(K), where A(K) is the breadth of the Alexander polynomial of K. However, for every g we exhibit examples of genus-g knots having the same Alexander polynomial but different quandle invariants A_Q. Moreover, in such examples A_Q provides sharp lower bounds for the genera of the knots. On the other hand, A_Q(L) can give better lower bounds on the genus than A(L), when L has at least two components.   We show that in order to compute A_Q(L) it is enough to consider only colorings with respect to the constant labelling z=1. In the case when L=K is a knot, if either A_Q(K)=A(K) or A_Q(K) provides a sharp lower bound for the knot genus, or if A_Q(K)=1, then A_Q(K) can be realized by means of the proper subfamily of quandles X=(F_p,*), where p varies among the odd prime numbers.
