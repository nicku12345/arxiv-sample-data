This paper concerns the H(2)-unknotting numbers of links related to 2-bridge links. It consists of three parts. In the first part, we consider a necessary and sufficient condition for a 2-bridge link to have H(2)-unknotting number one. The second part concerns an explicit form of composite links with H(2)-unknotting number one. In the last part, we develop a method of studying the H(2)-unknotting numbers of some tangle unknotting number one knots via 2-bridge knots.
