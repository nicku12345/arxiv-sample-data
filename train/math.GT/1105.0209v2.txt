Let X be a real analytic orbifold. Then each stratum of X is a subanalytic subset of X. We show that X has a unique subanalytic triangulation compatible with the strata of X. We also show that every {\rm C}^r-orbifold, 1\leq r\leq \infty, has a real analytic structure. This allows us to triangulate differentiable orbifolds. The results generalize the subanalytic triangulation theorems previously known for quotient orbifolds.
