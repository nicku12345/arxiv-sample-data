We show that if M is an orientable 4-dimensional infrasolvmanifold and either \beta=\beta_1(M;\mathbb{Q})\geq2 or M is a \mathbb{S}ol_0^4- or a \mathbb{S}ol_{m,n}^4-manifold (with m\not=n) then M is parallelizable. There are non-parallelizable examples with \beta=1 for each of the other solvable Lie geometries \mathbb{E}^4, \mathbb{N}il^4, \mathbb{N}il^3\times\mathbb{E}^1 and \mathbb{S}ol^3\times\mathbb{E}^1. We also determine which non-orientable flat 4-manifolds have a Pin^+- or Pin^--structure, and consider briefly this question for the other cases.
