Let S be a Riemann surface with a puncture x. Let a\subset S be a simple closed geodesic. In this paper, we show that for any pseudo-Anosov map f of S that is isotopic to the identity on S\cup \{x\}, (a, f^m(a)) fills S for m\geq 3. We also study the cases of 0<m\leq 2 and show that if (a,f^2(a)) does not fill S, then there is only one geodesic b such that b is disjoint from both a and f^2(a). In fact, b=f(a) and \{a,f(a)\} forms the boundary of an x-punctured cylinder on S. As a consequence, we show that if a and f(a) are not disjoint. Then (a,f^m(a)) for any m\geq 2 fills S.
