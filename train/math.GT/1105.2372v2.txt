Given a closed hyperbolic 3-manifold M, we construct a tower of covers with increasing Heegaard genus, and give an explicit lower bound on the Heegaard genus of such covers as a function of their degree. Using similar methods we prove that for any \epsilon>0 there exist infinitely many congruence covers \{M_i\} such that, for any x \in M, M_i contains an embbeded ball B_x (with center x) satisfying \text{vol}(B_x) > (\text{vol}(M_i))^{\tfrac{1}{4}-\epsilon}. We get similar results in the arithmetic non-compact case.
