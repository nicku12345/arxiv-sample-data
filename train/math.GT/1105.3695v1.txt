In this paper, we study the colorability of link diagrams by the Alexander quandles. We show that if the reduced Alexander polynomial \Delta_{L}(t) is vanishing, then L admits a non-trivial coloring by any non-trivial Alexander quandle Q, and that if \Delta_{L}(t)=1, then L admits only the trivial coloring by any Alexander quandle Q, also show that if \Delta_{L}(t)\not=0, 1, then L admits a non-trivial coloring by the Alexander quandle \Lambda/(\Delta_{L}(t)).
