The author, in her previous paper, constructed an infinite family of 3-bridge links each of which admits infinitely many 3-bridge spheres up to isotopy. In this paper, we prove that if a prime, unsplittable link L in S^3 admits infinitely many 3-bridge spheres up to isotopy then L belongs to the family.
