Given two free homotopy classes \alpha_1, \alpha_2 of loops on an oriented surface, it is natural to ask how to compute the minimum number of intersection points m(\alpha_1, \alpha_2) of loops in these two classes.   We show that for \alpha_1\neq\alpha_2 the number of terms in the Andersen-Mattes-Reshetikhin Poisson bracket of \alpha_1 and \alpha_2 is equal to m(\alpha_1, \alpha_2). Chas found examples showing that a similar statement does not, in general, hold for the Goldman Lie bracket of \alpha_1 and \alpha_2.   The main result of this paper in the case where \alpha_1, \alpha_2 do not contain different powers of the same loop first appeared in the unpublished preprint of the second author. In order to prove the main result for all pairs of \alpha_1\neq \alpha_2 we had to use the techniques developed by the first author in her study of operations generalizing Turaev's cobracket of loops on a surface.
