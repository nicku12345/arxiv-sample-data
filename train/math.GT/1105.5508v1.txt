We compute the Heegaard Floer homology of S^3_1(K) (the (+1) surgery on the torus knot T_{p,q}) in terms of the semigroup generated by p and q, and we find a compact formula (involving Dedekind sums) for the corresponding Ozsvath--Szabo d-invariant. We relate the result to known knot invariants of T_{p,q} as the genus and the Levine--Tristram signatures. Furthermore, we emphasize the striking resemblance between Heegaard Floer homologies of (+1) and (-1) surgeries on torus knots. This relation is best seen at the level of \tau functions.
