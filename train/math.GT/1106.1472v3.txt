We study the topological types of pants decompositions of a surface by associating to any pants decomposition P, in a natural way its pants decomposition graph, \Gamma(P). This perspective provides a convenient way to analyze the maximum distance in the pants complex of any pants decomposition to a pants decomposition containing a non-trivial separating curve for all surfaces of finite type. In the main theorem we provide an asymptotically sharp approximation of this non-trivial distance in terms of the topology of the surface. In particular, for closed surfaces of genus g we show the maximum distance in the pants complex of any pants decomposition to a pants decomposition containing a separating curve grows asymptotically like the function \log(g).
