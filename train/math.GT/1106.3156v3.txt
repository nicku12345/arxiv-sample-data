We prove a Kazhdan-Margulis-Zassenhaus lemma for Hilbert geometries. More precisely, in every dimension n there exists a constant \varepsilon_n > 0 such that, for any properly open convex set \O and any point x \in \O, any discrete group generated by a finite number of automorphisms of \O, which displace x at a distance less than \varepsilon_n, is virtually nilpotent.
