This paper describes how to recover the topology of a closed manifold M from a good Morse function f on M. The essential method was suggested by Cohen, Jones and Segal. They constructed a topological category C_{f} and claimed that the classifying space BC_{f} is homeomorphic to M. We prove it from a different viewpoint with them using a cell decomposition of M associated to f. The cell complex M_{f} equipped with the decomposition induces a topological category C(M_{f}) whose classifying space BC(M_{f}) is homeomorphic to M. We show that C(M_{f}) is isomorphic to C_{f} as a topological category.
