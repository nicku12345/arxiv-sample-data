We give a counterexample to the Kawauchi conjecture on the Conway polynomial of achiral knots which asserts that the Conway polynomial C(z) of an achiral knot satisfies the splitting property C(z)=F(z)F(-z) for a polynomial F(z) with integer coefficients. We show that the Bonahon-Siebenmann decomposition of an achiral and alternating knot is reflected in the Conway polynomial. More explicitly, the Kawauchi conjecture is true for quasi-arborescent knots and counterexamples in the class of alternating knots must be quasi-polyhedral.
