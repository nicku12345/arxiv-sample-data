Given a Hitchin representation \rho \colon \pi_1(S) \to \PSL_n(\mathbb{R}), we construct n continuous functions \ell_i^\rho \colon \mathcal \CH(S) \to \mathbb{R} defined on the space of H\"older geodesic currents \CH(S) such that, for a closed, oriented curve \gamma in S, the i--th eigenvalue of the matrix \rho(\gamma)\in \PSL_n(\mathbb{R}) is of the form \pm \mathrm{exp}\, \ell_i^\rho(\gamma): such functions generalize to higher rank Thurston's length function of Fuchsian re\presentations. Identities, diffe\rentiability properties of these lengths \ell_i^\rho, as well as applications to eigenvalue estimates, are also considered.
