We provide necessary conditions for the Alexander polynomials of algebraically split component-preservingly amphicheiral links. We raise a conjecture that the Alexander polynomial of an algebraically split component-preservingly amphicheiral link with even components is zero. Our necessary conditions and some examples support the conjecture.
