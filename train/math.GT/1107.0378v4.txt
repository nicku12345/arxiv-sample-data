We determine prime amphicheiral links with at least 2 components and up to 11 crossings. There are 27 such links. We check also special amphicheiralities. Most of prime links with up to 11 crossings are detected not to be amphicheiral by a condition on the Jones polynomial. For the rest links, we applied conditions from the Alexander polynomial. We added new necessary conditions for a special case.
