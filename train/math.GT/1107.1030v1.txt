Let N be a topologically finite, orientable 3-manifold with ideal triangulation. We show that if there is a solution to the hyperbolic gluing equations, then all edges in the triangulation are essential. This result is extended to a generalisation of the hyperbolic gluing equations, which enables the construction of hyperbolic cone-manifold structures on N with singular locus contained in the 1-skeleton of the triangulation.
