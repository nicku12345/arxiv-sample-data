We use the knot homology of Khovanov and Lee to construct link concordance invariants generalizing the Rasmussen s-invariant of knots. The relevant invariant for a link is a filtration on a vector space of dimension 2^{|L|}. The basic properties of the s-invariant all extend to the case of links; in particular, any orientable cobordism \Sigma between links induces a map between their corresponding vector spaces which is filtered of degree \chi(\Sigma). A corollary of this construction is that any component preserving orientable cobordism from a \Kh-thin link to a link split into k components must have genus at least \lfloor\frac k2\rfloor. In particular, no quasi-alternating link is concordant to a split link.
