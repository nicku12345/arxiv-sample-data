In this paper, it is shown that every orientable closed 3-manifold maps with nonzero degree onto at most finitely many homeomorphically distinct irreducible non-geometric orientable closed 3-manifolds. Moreover, given any nonzero integer, as a mapping degree up to sign, every orientable closed 3-manifold maps with that degree onto only finitely many homeomorphically distinct orientable closed 3-manifolds.
