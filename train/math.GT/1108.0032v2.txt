Ozsvath and Szabo gave a combinatorial description of knot Floer homology based on a cube of resolutions, which uses maps with twisted coefficients. We study the t=1 specialization of their construction. The associated spectral sequence converges to knot Floer homology, and we conjecture that its E_1 page is isomorphic to the HOMFLY-PT chain complex of Khovanov and Rozansky. At the level of each E_1 summand, this conjecture can be stated in terms of an isomorphism between certain Tor groups. As evidence for the conjecture, we prove that such an isomorphism exists in degree zero.
