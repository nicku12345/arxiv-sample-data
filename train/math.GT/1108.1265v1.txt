A {\it wrinkled embedding} f:V^n\to W^m is a topological embedding which is a smooth embedding everywhere on V except a set of (n-1)-dimensional spheres, where f has cuspidal corners. In this paper we prove that any rotation of the tangent plane field TV\subset TW of a {\it smoothly embedded} submanifold V\subset W can be approximated by a homotopy of {\it wrinkled embeddings} V\to W.
