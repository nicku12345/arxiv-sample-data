Various curve complexes with vertices representing multicurves on a surface S have been defined, for example [3], [4] and [8]. The homology curve complex \mathcal{HC}(S,\alpha) defined in [7] is one such complex, with vertices corresponding to multicurves in a nontrivial integral homology class \alpha. Given two multicurves m_1 and m_2 corresponding to vertices in \mathcal{HC}(S,\alpha), it was shown in [8] that a path in \mathcal{HC}(S,\alpha) connecting these vertices represents a surface in S\times \mathbb{R}, and a simple algorithm for constructing minimal genus surfaces of this type was obtained. In this paper, a Morse theoretic argument will be used to prove that all embedded orientable incompressible surfaces in S\times \mathbb{R} with boundary curves homotopic to m_{2}-m_1 are homotopic to a surface constructed in this way. This is used to relate distance between two vertices in \mathcal{HC}(S,\alpha) to the Seifert genus of the corresponding link in S\times \mathbb{R}.
