We give the diffeomorphism classification of complete intersections with S^1-symmetry in dimension less than or equal to 6. In particular, we show that a 6-dimensional complete intersection admits a smooth non-trivial S^1-action if and only if it is diffeomorphic to the complex projective space or the quadric. We also prove that in any odd complex dimension only finitely many complete intersections can carry a smooth effective action by a torus of rank >1.
