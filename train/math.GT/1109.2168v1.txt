Given an l-component pointed oriented link (L,p) in an oriented three-manifold Y, one can construct its link Floer chain complex CFL(Y,L,p) over the polynomial ring F_2[U_1,...,U_l]. Moving the basepoint p_i in the link component L_i once around induces an automorphism of CFL(Y,L,p). In this paper, we study an automorphism (a possibly different one) of CFL(Y,L,p) defined explicitly in terms of holomorphic disks; for links in S^3, we show that these two automorphisms are the same.
