In this paper we study exceptional Dehn fillings on hyperbolic knot manifolds which contain an essential once-punctured torus. Let M be such a knot manifold and let \beta be the boundary slope of such an essential once-punctured torus. We prove that if Dehn filling M with slope \alpha produces a Seifert fibred manifold, then \Delta(\alpha,\beta)\leq 5. Furthermore we classify the triples (M; \alpha,\beta) when \D(\alpha,\beta)\geq 4. More precisely, when \D(\alpha,\beta)=5, then M is the (unique) manifold Wh(-3/2) obtained by Dehn filling one boundary component of the Whitehead link exterior with slope -3/2, and (\alpha, \beta) is the pair of slopes (-5, 0). Further, \D(\alpha,\beta)=4 if and only if (M; \alpha,\beta) is the triple \displaystyle (Wh(\frac{-2n\pm1}{n}); -4, 0) for some integer n with |n|>1. Combining this with known results, we classify all hyperbolic knot manifolds M and pairs of slopes (\beta, \gamma) on \partial M where \beta is the boundary slope of an essential once-punctured torus in M and \gamma is an exceptional filling slope of distance 4 or more from \beta. Refined results in the special case of hyperbolic genus one knot exteriors in S^3 are also given.
