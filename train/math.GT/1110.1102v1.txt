In his 1930 paper, Kuratowksi categorized planar graphs, proving that a finite graph \Gamma is planar if and only if it does not contain a subgraph that is homeomorphic to K_5, the complete graph on 5 vertices, or K_{3,3}, the complete bipartite graph on six vertices. In their 2001 paper, Davis and Okun point out that the K_{3,3} graph can be understood as the nerve of a right-angled Coxeter system and prove that this graph is not planar using results from \ell^2-homology. In this paper, we employ a similar method proving K_5 is not planar.
