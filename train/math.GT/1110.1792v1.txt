If an m+2-manifold M is locally modeled on \RR^{m+2} with coordinate changes lying in the subgroup G=\RR^{m+2}\rtimes ({\rO}(m+1,1)\times \RR^+) of the affine group {\rA}(m+2), then M is said to be a \emph{Lorentzian similarity manifold}. A Lorentzian similarity manifold is also a conformally flat Lorentzian manifold because G is isomorphic to the stabilizer of the Lorentz group {\rPO}(m+2,2) which is the full Lorentzian group of the Lorentz model S^{2n+1,1}. It contains a class of Lorentzian flat space forms. We shall discuss the properties of compact Lorentzian similarity manifolds using developing maps and holonomy representations.
