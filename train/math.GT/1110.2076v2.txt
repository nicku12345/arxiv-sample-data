The Reshetikhin-Turaev sl(N) polynomial of links colored by wedge powers of the defining representation has been categorified via several different approaches. Here, we give a concise introduction to the categorification using matrix factorizations, which is a direct generalization of the Khovanov-Rozansky homology. Full details of the construction are given in [arXiv:0907.0695]. We also briefly review deformations and applications of this categorification given in [arXiv:1002.2662, arXiv:1011.2254, arXiv:1102.0586].
