We discuss two families of closed orientable three-dimensional manifolds which arise as cyclic generalizations of two hyperbolic icosahedral manifolds listed by Everitt. Everitt's manifolds are cyclic coverings of the lens space L_{3,1} branched over some 2-component links. We present results on covering properties, fundamental groups, and hyperbolic volumes of the manifolds belonging to these families.
