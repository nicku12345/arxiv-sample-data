Given a closed binding curve \gamma of a surface \Sigma, any equivalence class of marked complete hyperbolic structure can be decomposed into polygons(possibly with a puncture) with sides being hyperbolic geodesic segments. When \Sigma is a one-holed torus and \gamma = A^3 B^2, we show that any equivalence class of marked complete hyperbolic structure gives rise to an equilateral bigon with a puncture and a hexagon with equal opposite sides. In particular, we give a new coordinates of the Fricke Space of the one-holed torus.
