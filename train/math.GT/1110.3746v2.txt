In this note we explore a connection between finite covers of surfaces and the Teichm\"uller polynomial of a fibered face of a hyperbolic 3--manifold. We consider the action of a homological pseudo-Anosov homeomorphism \psi on the homology groups of a class of finite abelian covers of a surface \Sigma_{g,n}. Eigenspaces of the deck group actions on these covers are naturally parametrized by rational points on a torus. We show that away from the trivial eigenspace, the spectrum of the action of \psi on these eigenspaces is bounded away from the dilatation of \psi. We show that the action \psi on these eigenspaces is governed by the Teichm\"uller polynomial.
