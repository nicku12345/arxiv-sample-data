This paper provides two obstructions to small knot complements in S^3 admitting hidden symmetries. The first obstruction is being cyclically commensurable with another knot complement. This result provides a partial answer to a conjecture of Boileau, Boyer, Cebanu, and Walsh. We also provide a second obstruction to admitting hidden symmetries in the case where a small knot complement covers a manifold admitting some symmetry and at least two exceptional surgeries.
