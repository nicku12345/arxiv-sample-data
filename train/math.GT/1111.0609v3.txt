We extend Bar-Natan's cobordism based categorification of the Jones polynomial to virtual links. Our topological complex allows a direct extension of the classical Khovanov complex (h=t=0), the variant of Lee (h=0,t=1) and other classical link homologies. We show that our construction allows, over rings of characteristic two, extensions with no classical analogon, e.g. Bar-Natan's \mathbb{Z}/2-link homology can be extended in two non-equivalent ways.   Our construction is computable in the sense that one can write a computer program to perform calculations, e.g. we have written a Mathematica based program.   Moreover, we give a classification of all unoriented TQFTs which can be used to define virtual link homologies from our topological construction. Furthermore, we prove that our extension is combinatorial and has semi-local properties. We use the semi-local properties to prove an application, i.e. we give a discussion of Lee's degeneration of virtual homology.
