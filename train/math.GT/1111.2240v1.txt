Ozsvath, Rasmussen and Szabo constructed odd Khovanov homology. It is a link invariant which has the same reduction modulo 2 as (even) Khovanov homology. Szabo introduced a spectral sequence with mod 2 coefficients from mod 2 Khovanov homology to another link homology. He got his spectral sequence from a chain complex with a filtration. We give an integral lift of Szabo's complex, that provides a spectral sequence from odd Khovanov homology to a link homology, from which one can get Szabo's link homology with the Universal Coefficient Theorem. Szabo has constructed such a lift independently, but has not yet published it. This is my master thesis which I wrote under supervision of Thomas Schick at Georg August University G\"ottingen in summer 2011. It is in German. I will publish a reworked version in English later.
