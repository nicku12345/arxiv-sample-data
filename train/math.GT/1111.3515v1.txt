Let G_{g,b} be the set of all uni/trivalent graphs representing the combinatorial structures of pant decompositions of the oriented surface of genus g with b boundary components. We describe the set A_{g,b} of all automorphisms of graphs in G_{g,b} showing that, up to suitable moves changing the graph within G_{g,b}, any such automorphism can be reduced to elementary switches of adjacent edges.
