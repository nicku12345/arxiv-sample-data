We study the bounded fundamental class in the top dimensional bounded cohomology of negatively curved manifolds with infinite volume. We prove that the bounded fundamental class of M vanishes if M is geometrically finite. Furthermore, when M is a \mathbb{R}-rank one locally symmetric space, we show that the bounded fundamental class of M vanishes if and only if the Riemannian volume form on M is the differential of a bounded differential form on M.
