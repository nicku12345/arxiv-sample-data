This article provides sufficient conditions for a closed hyperbolic 3-manifold M with non zero first Betti number to fiber over the circle, and to find a fiber in M. Those conditions are formulated in terms of the behavior the circular characteristic in finite regular covers of M. We define the circular characteristic as an invariant associated to a non trivial cohomology class \alpha of M, using a Heegaard characteristic.
