We show that every locally compact group which acts faithfully on a connected three-manifold is a Lie group. By known reductions, it suffices to show that there is no faithful action of \mathbb Z_p (the p-adic integers) on a connected three-manifold. If \mathbb Z_p acts faithfully on M^3, we find an interesting \mathbb Z_p-invariant open set U\subseteq M with H_2(U)=\mathbb Z and analyze the incompressible surfaces in U representing a generator of H_2(U). It turns out that there must be one such incompressible surface, say F, whose isotopy class is fixed by \mathbb Z_p. An analysis of the resulting homomorphism \mathbb Z_p\to\operatorname{MCG}(F) gives the desired contradiction. The approach is local on M.
