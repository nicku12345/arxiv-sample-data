We construct quantum \mathcal{U}_q(\mathfrak{sl}_{\,2}) type invariants for handlebody-knots in the 3-sphere S^3. A handlebody-knot is an embedding of a handlebody in a 3-manifold. These invariants are linear sums of Yokota's invariants for colored spatial graphs which are defined by using the Kauffman bracket. We give a table of calculations of our invariants for genus 2 handlebody-knots up to six crossings. We also show our invariants are identified with special cases of the Witten-Reshetikhin-Turaev invariants.
