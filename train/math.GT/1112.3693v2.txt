The fundamental group of M = \sharp_n (S^2\times S^1) is F_n, the free group with n generators. There is a 1-1 correspondence between the equivalence classes of \mathbb{Z}-- splittings of F_n and homotopy classes of embedded essential tori in M. We define and prove a local notion of minimal intersection of a torus with respect to a maximal sphere system in M, which generalizes Hatcher's work \cite{H1} on 2-spheres in the same manifold.
