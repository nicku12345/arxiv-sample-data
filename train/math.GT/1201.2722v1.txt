We consider the "intrinsic" symmetry group of a two-component link L, defined to be the image \Sigma(L) of the natural homomorphism from the standard symmetry group \MCG(S^3,L) to the product \MCG(S^3) \cross \MCG(L). This group, first defined by Whitten in 1969, records directly whether L is isotopic to a link L' obtained from L by permuting components or reversing orientations; it is a subgroup of \Gamma_2, the group of all such operations.   For two-component links, we catalog the 27 possible intrinsic symmetry groups, which represent the subgroups of \Gamma_2 up to conjugacy. We are able to provide prime, nonsplit examples for 21 of these groups; some are classically known, some are new. We catalog the frequency at which each group appears among all 77,036 of the hyperbolic two-component links of 14 or fewer crossings in Thistlethwaite's table. We also provide some new information about symmetry groups of the 293 non-hyperbolic two-component links of 14 or fewer crossings in the table.
