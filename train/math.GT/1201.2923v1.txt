This work is devoted to the study of deformations of hyperbolic cone structures under the assumption that the lengths of the singularity remain uniformly bounded over the deformation. Given a sequence (M_{i}%, p_{i})  of pointed hyperbolic cone-manifolds with topological type (M,\Sigma) , where M is a closed, orientable and irreducible 3-manifold and \Sigma an embedded link in M. If the sequence M_{i} collapses and assuming that the lengths of the singularity remain uniformly bounded, we prove that M is either a Seifert fibered or a Sol manifold. We apply this result to a question stated by Thurston and to the study of convergent sequences of holonomies.
