Let M_1 and M_2 be compact, orientable 3-manifolds with incompressible boundary, and M the manifold obtained by gluing with a homeomorphism \phi:\bdy M_1 \to \bdy M_2. We analyze the relationship between the sets of low genus Heegaard splittings of M_1, M_2, and M, assuming the map \phi is "sufficiently complicated." This analysis yields counter-examples to the Stabilization Conjecture, a resolution of the higher genus analogue of a conjecture of Gordon, and a result about the uniqueness of expressions of Heegaard splittings as amalgamations.
