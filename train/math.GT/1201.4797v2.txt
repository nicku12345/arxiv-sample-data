We construct a relation among right-handed Dehn twists in the mapping class group of a compact oriented surface of genus g with 4g+4 boundary components. This relation gives an explicit topological description of 4g+4 disjoint (-1)-sections of a hyperelliptic Lefschetz fibration of genus g on the manifold {CP}^2#(4g+5){-CP}^2.
