Every exotic pair in 4-dimension is obtained each other by twisting a {\it cork} or {\it plug} which are codimension 0 submanifolds embedded in the 4-manifolds. The twist was an involution on the boundary of the submanifold. We define cork (or plug) with order p\in {\Bbb N}\cup \{\infty\} and show there exists a plug with infinite order. Furthermore we show twisting (P,\varphi^2) gives to enlargements of P compact exotic manifolds with boundary.
