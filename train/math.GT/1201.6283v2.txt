We propose and analyze a structure with which to organize the difference between a knot in the 3-sphere bounding a topologically embedded 2-disk in the 4-ball and it bounding a smoothly embedded disk. The n-solvable filtration of the topological knot concordance group, due to Cochran-Orr-Teichner, may be complete in the sense that any knot in the intersection of its terms may well be topologically slice. However, the natural extension of this filtration to what is called the n-solvable filtration of the smooth knot concordance group, is unsatisfactory because any topologically slice knot lies in every term of the filtration. To ameliorate this we investigate a new filtration, {B_n}, that is simultaneously a refinement of the n-solvable filtration and a generalization of notions of positivity studied by Gompf and Cochran. We show that each B_n/B_{n+1} has infinite rank. But our primary interest is in the induced filtration, {T_n}, on the subgroup, T, of knots that are topologically slice. We prove that T/T_0 is large, detected by gauge-theoretic invariants and the tau, s, and epsilon-invariants; while the non-triviliality of T_0/T_1 can be detected by certain d-invariants. All of these concordance obstructions vanish for knots in T_1. Nonetheless, going beyond this, our main result is that T_1/T_2 has positive rank. Moreover under a "weak homotopy-ribbon" condition, we show that each T_n/T_{n+1} has positive rank. These results suggest that, even among topologically slice knots, the fundamental group is responsible for a wide range of complexity.
