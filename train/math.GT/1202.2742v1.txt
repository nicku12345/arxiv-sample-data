A C_k-move is a local move that involves (k+1) strands of a link. A C_k-move is called a C_k^d-move if these (k+1) strands belong to mutually distinct components of a link. Since a C_k^d-move preserves all k-component sublinks of a link, we consider the converse implication: are two links with common k-component sublinks related by a sequence of C_k^d-moves? We show that the answer is yes under certain assumptions, and provide explicit counter-examples for more general situations. In particular, we consider (n,k)-Brunnian links, i.e. n-component links whose k-component sublinks are all trivial. We show that such links can be deformed into a trivial link by C_k^d-moves, thus generalizing a result of Habiro and Miyazawa-Yasuhara, and deduce some results on finite type invariants of (n,k)-Brunnian links.
