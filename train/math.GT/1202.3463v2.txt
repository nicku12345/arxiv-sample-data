This paper computes Whitney tower filtrations of classical links. Whitney towers consist of iterated stages of Whitney disks and allow a tree-valued intersection theory, showing that the associated graded quotients of the filtration are finitely generated abelian groups. Twisted Whitney towers are studied and a new quadratic refinement of the intersection theory is introduced, measuring Whitney disk framing obstructions. It is shown that the filtrations are completely classified by Milnor invariants together with new higher-order Sato-Levine and higher-order Arf invariants, which are obstructions to framing a twisted Whitney tower in the 4-ball bounded by a link in the 3-sphere. Applications include computation of the grope filtration, and new geometric characterizations of Milnor's link invariants.
