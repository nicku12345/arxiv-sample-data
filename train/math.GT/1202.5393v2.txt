In this paper, we study the Khovanov homology of cable links. We first estimate the maximal homological degree term of the Khovanov homology of the (2k+1, (2k+1)n)-torus link and give a lower bound of its homological thickness. Specifically, we show that the homological thickness of the (2k+1, (2k+1)n)-torus link is greater than or equal to k^{2}n+2. Next, we study the maximal homological degree of the Khovanov homology of the (p, pn)-cabling of any knot with sufficiently large n. Furthermore, we compute the maximal homological degree term of the Khovanov homology of such a link with even p. As an application we compute the Khovanov homology and the Rasmussen invariant of a twisted Whitehead double of any knot with sufficiently many twists.
