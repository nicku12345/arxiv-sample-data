Let \mathcal{M}_{g,\epsilon} be the \epsilon-thick part of the moduli space \mathcal{M}_g of closed genus g surfaces. In this article, we show that the number of balls of radius r needed to cover \mathcal{M}_{g,\epsilon} is bounded below by (c_1g)^{2g} and bounded above by (c_2g)^{2g}, where the constants c_1,c_2 depend only on \epsilon and r, and in particular not on g. Using the counting result we prove that there are Riemann surfaces of arbitrarily large injectivity radius that are not close (in the Teichm\"uller metric) to a finite cover of a fixed closed Riemann surface. This result illustrates the sharpness of the Ehrenpreis conjecture.
