We derive two types of linearity conditions for mapping class groups of orientable surfaces: one for once-punctured surface, and the other for closed surface, respectively. For the once-punctured case, the condition is described in terms of the action of the mapping class group on the deformation space of linear representations of the fundamental group of the corresponding closed surface. For the closed case, the condition is described in terms of the vector space generated by the isotopy classes of essential simple closed curves on the corresponding surface. The latter condition also describes the linearity for the mapping class group of compact orientable surface with boundary, up to center.
