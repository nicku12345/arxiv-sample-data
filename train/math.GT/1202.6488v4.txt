For every odd integer c\ge 21, we raise an example of a prime component-preservingly amphicheiral link with the minimal crossing number c. The link has two components, and consists of an unknot and a knot which is (-)-amphicheiral with odd minimal crossing number. We call the latter knot a {\it Stoimenow knot}. We also show that the Stoimenow knot is not invertible by the Alexander polynomials.
