Let F be a leafwise hyperbolic taut foliation of a closed 3-manifold M and let L be the leaf space of the pullback of F to the universal cover of M. We show that if F has branching, then the natural action of \pi_1(M) on L is faithful. We also show that if F has a finite branch locus B whose stabilizer acts on B nontrivially, then the stabilizer is an infinite cyclic group generated by an indivisible element of \pi_1(M).
