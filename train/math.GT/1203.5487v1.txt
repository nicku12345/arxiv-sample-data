Let M be a compact orientable irreducible 3-manifold and H be an unstabilized genus three Heegaard splitting of M. In this article, we will define a simplicial complex of weak reducing pairs for H and find several properties of this complex. Using this method, we will prove that an unstabilized Heegaard splitting of genus three is critical in a certain condition. In addition, we will show that the standard genus three Heegaard splitting for T^3 and the induced Heegaard splitting of the three component chain exterior by a certain tunnel system are critical as examples of the main theorem.
