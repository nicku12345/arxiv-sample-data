We define an algebraic group comprising symmetric chain complexes which captures the first two stages of the Cochran-Orr-Teichner solvable filtration of the knot concordance group in a single invariant. To achieve this we impose additional structure on each chain complex which puts extra control on the fundamental groups, and in particular on the way in which they can change in a concordance.
