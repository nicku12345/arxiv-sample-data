We study lens space surgeries along two different families of 2-component links, denoted by A_{m,n} and B_{p,q}, related with the rational homology 4-ball used in J.\ Park's (generalized) rational blow down. We determine which coefficient r of the knotted component of the link yields a lens space by Dehn surgery. The link A_{m,n} yields a lens space only by the known surgery with r=mn and unexpectedly with r=7 for (m,n)=(2,3). On the other hand, B_{p,q} yields a lens space by infinitely many r. Our main tool for the proof is the Reidemeister-Turaev torsions, i.e.\ Reidemeister torsions with combinatorial Euler structures. Our results can be extended to the links whose Alexander polynomials are same with those of A_{m,n} and B_{p,q}.
