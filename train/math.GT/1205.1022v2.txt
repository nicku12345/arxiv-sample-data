We show that the isomorphism induced by the inclusion of pairs (X,\emptyset)\subset (X,Y) between the relative bounded cohomology of (X,Y) and the bounded cohomology of X is isometric in degree at least 2 if the fundamental group of each connected component of Y is amenable. As an application we provide a self-contained proof of Gromov Equivalence theorem and a generalization of a result of Fujiwara and Manning on the simplicial volume of generalized Dehn fillings.
