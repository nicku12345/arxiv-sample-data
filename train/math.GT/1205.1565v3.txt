We show that any smooth, closed, oriented, connected 4--manifold can be trisected into three copies of \natural^k (S^1 \times B^3), intersecting pairwise in 3--dimensional handlebodies, with triple intersection a closed 2--dimensional surface. Such a trisection is unique up to a natural stabilization operation. This is analogous to the existence, and uniqueness up to stabilization, of Heegaard splittings of 3--manifolds. A trisection of a 4--manifold X arises from a Morse 2--function G:X \to B^2 and the obvious trisection of B^2, in much the same way that a Heegaard splitting of a 3--manifold Y arises from a Morse function g : Y \to B^1 and the obvious bisection of B^1.
