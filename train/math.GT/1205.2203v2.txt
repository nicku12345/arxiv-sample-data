Our aim is to generalize the result that two generic complex line arrangements are equivalent. In fact for a line arrangement A we associate its defining polynomial, the product of a_ix+b_iy+c_i, so that A = (f=0). We prove that the defining polynomials of two generic line arrangements are, up to a small deformation, topologically equivalent. In higher dimension the related result is that within a family of equivalent hyperplane arrangements the defining polynomials are topologically equivalent.
