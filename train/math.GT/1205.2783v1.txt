In arxiv:1205.1274 Rieck and Yamashita defined the link volume of 3-manifolds and studied some of its basic properties. Many of these properties are similar to the corresponding properties of the hyperbolic volume.   In this paper we calculate the link volume of an infinite family of prism manifolds. As a corollary, we show that (in contrast to the hyperbolic volume) the link volume is not finite-to-one.
