We construct an infinite family of quasi-alternating links from a given quasi-alternating link by replacing a crossing by a product of rational tangles each of which extends that crossing. Consequently, we determine an infinite family of quasi-alternating Montesinos links. This family contains all the classes of quasi-alternating Montesinos links that have been detected by Widmar in \cite{W}. We conjecture that this family contains all quasi-alternating Montesinos links up to mirror image that are not alternating and this will characterize all quasi-alternating Montesinos links.
