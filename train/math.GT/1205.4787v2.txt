Let \Gamma be a lattice in a connected semisimple Lie group G with trivial center and no compact factors. We introduce a volume invariant for representations of \Gamma into G, which generalizes the volume invariant for representations of uniform lattices introduced by Goldman. Then, we show that the maximality of this volume invariant exactly characterizes discrete, faithful representations of \Gamma into G except for \Gamma\subset \mathrm{PSL_2 \mathbb{C}} a nonuniform lattice.
