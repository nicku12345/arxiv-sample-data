We study simple wrinkled fibrations, a variation of the simplified purely wrinkled fibrations introduced by Williams, and their combinatorial description in terms of surface diagrams. We show that simple wrinkled fibrations induce handle decompositions on their total spaces which are very similar to those obtained from Lefschetz fibrations. The handle decompositions turn out to be closely related to surface diagrams and we use this relationship to interpret some cut-and-paste operations on 4-manifolds in terms of surface diagrams. This, in turn, allows us classify all closed 4-manifolds which admit simple wrinkled fibrations of genus one, the lowest possible fiber genus.
