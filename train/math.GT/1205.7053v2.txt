Given an element in the first homology of a rational homology 3-sphere Y, one can consider the minimal rational genus of all knots in this homology class. This defines a function \Theta on H_1(Y;\mathbb Z), which was introduced by Turaev as an analogue of Thurston norm. We will give a lower bound for this function using the correction terms in Heegaard Floer homology. As a corollary, we show that Floer simple knots in L-spaces are genus minimizers in their homology classes, hence answer questions of Turaev and Rasmussen about genus minimizers in lens spaces.
