Topological quantum field theories with gauge group \textrm{SU}_2 associate to each surface with marked points \Sigma and each integer r>0 a vector space V_r (\Sigma) and to each simple closed curve \gamma in \Sigma an Hermitian operator T_r^{\gamma} acting on that space. We show that the matrix elements of the operators T_r^{\gamma} have an asymptotic expansion in orders of \frac{1}{r}, and give a formula to compute the first two terms in terms of trace functions, generalizing results of March\'e and Paul.
