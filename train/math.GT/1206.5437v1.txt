In \cite{GZ}, Gilmer and Zhong established the existence of an invariant for links in S^1\times S^2 which is a rational function in variables a and s and satisfies the HOMFLY-PT skein relations. We give formulas for evaluating this invariant in terms of a standard, geometrically simple basis for the HOMFLY-PT skein module of the solid torus. This allows computation of the invariant for arbitrary links in S^1\times S^2 and shows that the invariant is in fact a Laurent polynomial in a and z= s -s^{-1}. Our proof uses connections between HOMFLY-PT skein modules and invariants of Legendrian links. As a corollary, we extend HOMFLY-PT polynomial estimates for the Thurston-Bennequin number to Legendrian links in S^1\times S^2 with its tight contact structure.
