A slope \frac pq is called a characterizing slope for a given knot K_0 in S^3 if whenever the \frac pq-surgery on a knot K in S^3 is homeomorphic to the \frac pq-surgery on K_0 via an orientation preserving homeomorphism, then K=K_0. In this paper we try to find characterizing slopes for torus knots T_{r,s}. We show that any slope \frac pq which is larger than the number \frac{30(r^2-1)(s^2-1)}{67} is a characterizing slope for T_{r,s}. The proof uses Heegaard Floer homology and Agol--Lackenby's 6--Theorem. In the case of T_{5,2}, we obtain more specific information about its set of characterizing slopes by applying more Heegaard Floer homology techniques.
