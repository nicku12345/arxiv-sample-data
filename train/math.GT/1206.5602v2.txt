The calculus correspondence has been known to exist between generic pedal evolutions and generic wave front evolutions. In this paper, we first extend the known results on the calculus correspondence to evolutions with multi-parameters, and then give applications of calculus correspondence. Moreover, we discuss the possibility of generalization of the calculus correspondence to degenerate pedal evolutions and degenerate wave front evolutions.
