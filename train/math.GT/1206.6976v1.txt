The moduli space \mathcal{M}_{g} of compact Riemann surfaces of genus g has orbifold structure, and the set of singular points of such orbifold is the \textit{branch locus} \mathcal{B}_{g}. Given a prime number p \ge 7, \mathcal{B}_{g} contains isolated strata consisting of p-gonal Riemann surfaces for genera g \ge {3(p-1)\over 2},that are multiple of {p-1 \over 2}. This is a generalization of the results obtained in \cite{[BCI1]} for pentagonal Riemann surfaces, and the results of \cite{[K]} and \cite{[CI3]} for zero- and one-dimensional isolated strata in the branch locus.
