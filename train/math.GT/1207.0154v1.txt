Exceptional Dehn surgeries on arborescent knots have been classified except for Seifert fibered surgeries on Montesinos knots of length 3. There are infinitely many of them as it is known that 4n+6 and 4n+7 surgeries on a (-2, 3, 2n+1) pretzel knot are Seifert fibered. It will be shown that there are only finitely many others. A list of 20 surgeries will be given and proved to be Seifert fibered. We conjecture that this is a complete list.
