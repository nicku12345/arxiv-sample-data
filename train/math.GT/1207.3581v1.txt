Let S_g be a closed orientable surface of genus g \geq 2 and C a simple closed nonseparating curve in F. Let t_C denote a left handed Dehn twist about C. A \textit{fractional power} of t_C of \textit{exponent} \fraction{\ell}{n} is an h \in \Mod(S_g) such that h^n = t_C^{\ell}. Unlike a root of a t_C, a fractional power h can exchange the sides of C. We derive necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of both side-exchanging and side-preserving fractional powers. We show in the side-preserving case that if \gcd(\ell,n) = 1, then h will be isotopic to the \ell^{th} power of an n^{th} root of t_C and that n \leq 2g+1. In general, we show that n \leq 4g, and that side-preserving fractional powers of exponents \fraction{2g}{2g+2} and \fraction{2g}{4g} always exist. For a side-exchanging fractional power of exponent \fraction{\ell}{2n}, we show that 2n \geq 2g+2, and that side-exchanging fractional powers of exponent \fraction{2g+2}{4g+2} and \fraction{4g+1}{4g+2} always exist. We give a complete listing of certain side-preserving and side-exchanging fractional powers on S_5.
