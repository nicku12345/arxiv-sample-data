We show that the knot lattice homology of a knot in an L-space is equivalent to the knot Floer homology of the same knot (viewed these invariants as filtered chain complexes over the polynomial ring Z/2Z [U]). Suppose that G is a negative definite plumbing tree which contains a vertex w such that G-w is a union of rational graphs. Using the identification of knot homologies we show that for such graphs the lattice homology HF(G) is isomorphic to the Heegaard Floer homology HF^-(Y_G) of the corresponding rational homology sphere Y_G.
