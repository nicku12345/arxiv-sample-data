For every orientable surface of finite negative Euler characteristic, we find a right-angled Artin group of cohomological dimension two which does not embed into the associated mapping class group. For a right-angled Artin group on a graph \gam to embed into the mapping class group of a surface S, we show that the chromatic number of \gam cannot exceed the chromatic number of the clique graph of the curve graph \mathcal{C}(S). Thus, the chromatic number of \gam is a global obstruction to embedding the right-angled Artin group A(\gam) into the mapping class group \Mod(S).
