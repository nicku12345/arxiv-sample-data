Introduced recently, an n-crossing is a singular point in a projection of a link at which n strands cross such that each strand travels straight through the crossing. We introduce the notion of an \"ubercrossing projection, a knot projection with a single n-crossing. Such a projection is necessarily composed of a collection of loops emanating from the crossing. We prove the surprising fact that all knots have a special type of \"ubercrossing projection, which we call a petal projection, in which no loops contain any others. The rigidity of this form allows all the information about the knot to be concentrated in a permutation corresponding to the levels at which the strands lie within the crossing. These ideas give rise to two new invariants for a knot K: the \"ubercrossing number \"u(K), and petal number p(K). These are the least number of loops in any \"ubercrossing or petal projection of K, respectively. We relate \"u(K) and p(K) to other knot invariants, and compute p(K) for several classes of knots, including all knots of nine or fewer crossings.
