The lattice stick number s_L(K) of a knot K is defined to be the minimal number of straight line segments required to construct a stick presentation of K in the cubic lattice. In this paper, we find an upper bound on the lattice stick number of a nontrivial knot K, except trefoil knot, in terms of the minimal crossing number c(K) which is s_L(K) \leq 3 c(K) +2. Moreover if K is a non-alternating prime knot, then s_L(K) \leq 3 c(K) - 4.
