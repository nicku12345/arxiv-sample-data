By considering non-orientable surfaces in the surgered manifolds, we show that the 10/3- and -10/3-Dehn surgeries on the 2-bridge knot 9_{27} = S(49,19) are not cosmetic, i.e., they give mutually non-homeomorphic manifolds. The knot is unknown to have no cosmetic surgeries by previously known results; in particular, by using the Casson invariant and the Heegaard Floer homology.
