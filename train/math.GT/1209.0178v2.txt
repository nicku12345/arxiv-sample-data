In our works with Stoimenow, Vdovina and with Byberi, we introduced the virtual canonical genus g_{vc}(K) and the virtual bridge number vb(K) invariants of virtual knots. One can see from the definitions that for an classical knot K the values of these invariants are less or equal than the classical canonical genus g_c(K) and the bridge number b(K) respectively. We use Manturov's projection from the category of virtual knot diagrams to the category of classical knot diagrams, to show that for every classical knot type K we have g_{vc}(K)=g_c(K) and vb(K)=b(K).
