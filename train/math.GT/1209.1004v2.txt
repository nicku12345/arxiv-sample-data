Aitchison and Rubinstein constructed two knot complements that can be decomposed into two regular ideal dodecahedra. This paper shows that these knot complements are the only knot complements that decompose into n regular ideal dodecahedra, providing a partial solution to a conjecture of Neumann and Reid.
