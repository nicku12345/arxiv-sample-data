This is a commentary on Teichm\"ullers' paper "Ver\"anderliche Riemannsche Fl\"achen" (Variable Riemann Surfaces), published in 1944. This paper is the last one that Teichm\"uller wrote on the problem of moduli. At most places the paper contains ideas and no technical details. The author presents a completely new approach to Teichm\"uller space, compared to the approach he took in his first seminal paper "Extremale quasikonforme Abbildungen und quadratische Differentiale" and its sequel "Bestimmung der extremalen quasikonformen Abbildungen bei geschlossenen orientierten Riemannschen Fl\"achen" in which he completed some of the the results stated in the former. In the paper "Extremale quasikonforme ...", Teichm\"uller led the foundations of what we call today Teichm\"uller theory (but without the complex structure), defining its metric and introducing in that theory the techniques of quasiconformal mappings and of quadratic differentials as essential tools. In the present paper, the approach is more abstract, through complex analytic geometry. Teichm\"uller space, equipped with its complex-analytic structure, is characterized here by a certain universal property. Among the other ideas and results contained in the paper, we mention the following: (1) The existence and uniqueness of the universal Teichm\"uller curve, rediscovered later on by Ahlfors and by Bers. At the same time, this introduced the first fibre bundle over Teichm\"uller space. (2) The proof of the fact that the automorphisms group of the univeral Teichm\"uller curve is the extended mapping class group. (3) The idea of a fine moduli space. (4) The idea of using the period map to define a complex structure on Teichm\"uller space.
