For each pseudo-Anosov map \phi on surface S, we will associate it with a \mathbb{Q}-submodule of \mathbb{R}, denoted by A(S,\phi). A(S,\phi) is defined by an interaction between the Thurston norm and dilatation of pseudo-Anosov maps. We will develop a few nice properties of A(S,\phi) and give a few examples to show that A(S,\phi) is a nontrivial invariant. These nontrivial examples give an answer to a question asked by McMullen: the minimal point of the restriction of the dilatation function on fibered face need not be a rational point.
