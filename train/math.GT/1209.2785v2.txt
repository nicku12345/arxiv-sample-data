Combings of oriented compact 3-manifolds are homotopy classes of nowhere zero vector fields in these manifolds. A first known invariant of a combing is its Euler class, that is the Euler class of the normal bundle to a combing representative in the tangent bundle of the 3-manifold M. It only depends on the Spin^c-structure represented by the combing. When this Euler class is a torsion element of H^2(M;Z), we say that the combing is a torsion combing. Gompf introduced a Q-valued invariant \theta_G of torsion combings of closed 3-manifolds that distinguishes all combings that represent a given Spin^c-structure. This invariant provides a grading of the Heegaard Floer homology \hat{HF} for manifolds equipped with torsion Spin^c-structures. We give an alternative definition of the Gompf invariant and we express its variation as a linking number. We also define a similar invariant p_1 for combings of manifolds bounded by S^2. We show that the \Theta-invariant, that is the simplest configuration space integral invariant of rational homology spheres, is naturally an invariant of combings of rational homology balls, that reads (\frac14p_1 + 6 \lambda) where \lambda is the Casson-Walker invariant. The article also includes a mostly self-contained presentation of combings.
