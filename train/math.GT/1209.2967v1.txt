We apply the techniques of totally twisted Khovanov homology to the constructions by M. Asaeda, J. Przytycki, and A. Sikora of Khovanov type homologies for links and tangles in I-bundles over (orientable) surfaces. As a result we describe an invariant chain complex built out of resolutions with only non-contractible circles. We use these to understand the \delta-graded homology for links with alternating projection to the surface.
