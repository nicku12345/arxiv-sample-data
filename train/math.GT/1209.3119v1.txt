It is known that there are only finitely many knots with super bridge index 3. Jin and Jeon have provided a list of possible such candidates. However, they conjectured that the only knots with super bridge index 3 are trefoil and the figure eight knot. In this paper, we prove that the 5_2 knot and the 6_2 knot are also 3-super bridge knots by providing a polynomial representation of these knots in degree 6. This also answers a question asked by Durfee and O'Shea in their paper on polynomial knots: is there any 5-crossing knot in degree 6?
