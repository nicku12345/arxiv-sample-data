We establish the proportionality principle between the Riemannian volume and locally finite simplicial volume for Q-rank 1 locally symmetric spaces covered by products of hyperbolic spaces, giving the first examples for manifolds whose cusp groups are not necessarily amenable. Also, we give a simple direct proof of the proportionality principle for the locally finite simplicial volume and the relative simplicial volume of Q-rank 1 locally symmetric spaces with amenable cusp groups established by L\"oh and Sauer.
