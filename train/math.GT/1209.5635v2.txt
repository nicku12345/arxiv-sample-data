We prove that for every P there is a bound B depending only on P so that the mapping torus of every P--small irreducible train-track map can be obtained by surgery from one of B mapping tori. We show that given an integer P>0 there is a bound M depending only on P, so that there exists a presentation of the fundamental group of the mapping torus of a P--small irreducible train-track map with less than M generators and M relations.
