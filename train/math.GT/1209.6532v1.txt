In this paper we study some aspects of knots and links in lens spaces. Namely, if we consider lens spaces as quotient of the unit ball B^{3} with suitable identification of boundary points, then we can project the links on the equatorial disk of B^{3}, obtaining a regular diagram for them. In this contest, we obtain a complete finite set of Reidemeister type moves establishing equivalence, up to ambient isotopy, a Wirtinger type presentation for the fundamental group of the complement of the link and a diagrammatic method giving the first homology group. We also compute Alexander polynomial and twisted Alexander polynomials of this class of links, showing their correlation with Reidemeister torsion.
