Let \Omega=(\omega_{j})_{j\in I} be a collection of pairwise non-isotopic simple closed curves on the closed, orientable, genus g surface S_{g}, such that \omega_{i} and \omega_{j} intersect exactly once for i\neq j. It was recently demonstrated by Malestein, Rivin, and Theran that the cardinality of such a collection is no more than 2g+1. In this paper, we show that for g\geq 3, there exists at least two such collections with this maximum size up to the action of the mapping class group, answering a question posed by Malestein, Rivin and Theran.
