We use technology from sutured manifold theory and the theory of Heegaard splittings to relate genus reducing crossing changes on knots in S^3 to twists on surfaces arising in circular Heegaard splittings for knot complements. In a separate paper, currently in preparation, we prove that these circular Heegaard splittings may be searched for algorithmically, and together our results imply that an algorithm to detect when two hyperbolic or fibered knots of different genus are related by a crossing change would follow from an algorithm to determine whether two compact oriented surfaces in S^3 are related by a single twist.
