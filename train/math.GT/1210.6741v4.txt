This survey/expository article covers a variety of topics related to the "topology at infinity" of noncompact manifolds and complexes. In manifold topology and geometric group theory, the most important noncompact spaces are often contractible, so distinguishing one from another requires techniques beyond the standard tools of algebraic topology. One approach uses end invariants, such as the number of ends or the fundamental group at infinity; another approach seeks nice compactifications, then analyzes the boundaries. A thread connecting the two is shape theory.   In these notes we provide a careful development of several topics: homotopy and homology properties and invariants for ends of spaces, proper maps and homotopy equivalences, tameness conditions, shapes of ends, and various types of Z-compactifications and Z-boundaries. Classical and current research from both manifold topology and geometric group theory provide the context. Along the way, many open problems are encountered. Our primary goal is casual but coherent introduction that is accessible to graduate students and also of interest to active mathematicians whose research might benefit from knowledge of these topics.
