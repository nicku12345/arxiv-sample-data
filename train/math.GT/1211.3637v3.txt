Let M be a fibered 3-manifold with multiple boundary components. We show that the fiber structure of M transforms to closely related transversely oriented taut foliations realizing all rational multislopes in some open neighborhood of the multislope of the fiber. Each such foliation extends to a taut foliation in the closed 3-manifold obtained by Dehn filling along its boundary multislope. The existence of these foliations implies that certain contact structures are weakly symplectically fillable.
