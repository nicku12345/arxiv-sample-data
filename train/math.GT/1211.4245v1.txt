In this note, we compute the virtual first Betti numbers of 4-manifolds fibering over S^1 with prime fiber. As an application, we show that if such a manifold is symplectic with nonpositive Kodaira dimension, then the fiber itself is a sphere or torus bundle over S^1. In a different direction, we prove that if the 3-dimensional fiber of such a 4-manifold is virtually fibered then the 4-manifold is virtually symplectic unless its virtual first Betti number is 1.
