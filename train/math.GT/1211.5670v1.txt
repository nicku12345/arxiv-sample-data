Milnor fibrations have been studied since 1960's. In this paper, we study singular points of differentiable maps, called Milnor fibration product maps, obtained by several Milnor fibrations. We give a characterization of singular points of such product maps, and for the case of certain weighted homogeneous polynomials, a criterion for a fold point together with its index.
