Milnor fibrations were extended by Mutsuo Oka for certain mixed polynomial. In this paper, we study singular points of differentiable maps into the 2-dimensional torus, called Milnor fibration product maps, obtained by several Milnor fibrations for mixed polynomial. We give a characterization of singular points of such product maps, and for the case of certain polar weighted homogeneous polynomials, a criterion for a fold singular point.
