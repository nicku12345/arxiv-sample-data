We study the Asymptotic Cone of Teichm\"uller space equipped with the Weil-Petersson metric. In particular, we provide a characterization of the canonical finest pieces in the tree-graded structure of the asymptotic cone of Teichm\"uller space along the same lines as a similar characterization for right angled Artin groups by Behrstock-Charney and for mapping class groups by Behrstock-Kleiner-Minksy-Mosher. As a corollary of the characterization, we complete the thickness classification of Teichm\"uller spaces for all surfaces of finite type, thereby answering questions of Behrstock-Drutu, Behrstock-Drutu-Mosher, and Brock-Masur. In particular, we prove that Teichm\"uller space of the genus two surface with one boundary component (or puncture) can be uniquely characterized in the following two senses: it is thick of order two, and it has superquadratic yet at most cubic divergence. In addition, we characterize strongly contracting quasi-geodesics in Teichm\"uller space, generalizing results of Brock-Masur-Minsky. As a tool, we develop a complex of separating multicurves, which may be of independent interest.
