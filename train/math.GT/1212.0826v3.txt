This is part 2 of a 3-part article where we provide an O(n^2)-algorithm to produce a surgery presentation of a 3-manifold induced by a gem with a resolution. In this part we produce a sequence of colored simplicial 2-complexes which are inverses and dual to the sequence of gems produced in the first part. The refinements of the DPL-faces that keep appearing are idempotent: the second refinement of a DPL-face is isomorphic to its first refinement. This fact inhibits exponentiability.
