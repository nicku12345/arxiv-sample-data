The rational homology balls B_n appeared in Fintushel and Stern's rational blow-down construction [FS] and were subsequently used (e.g. Fintushel-Stern[FS4], Park[Pa2]) to construct exotic smooth manifolds with small Euler numbers. We show that a large class of smooth 4-manifolds have all of the B_n's for odd n \geq 3 embedded in them. In particular, we give explicit examples, using Kirby calculus, of several families of smooth embeddings of the rational homology balls B_n.
