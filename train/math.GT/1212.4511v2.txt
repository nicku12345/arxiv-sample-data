Motivated by a possible connection between the \mathrm{SU}(N) instanton knot Floer homology of Kronheimer and Mrowka and \mathfrak{sl}(N) Khovanov-Rozansky homology, Lobb and Zentner recently introduced a moduli problem associated to colourings of trivalent graphs of the kind considered by Murakami, Ohtsuki and Yamada in their state-sum interpretation of the quantum \mathfrak{sl}(N) knot polynomial. For graphs with two colours, they showed this moduli space can be thought of as a representation variety, and that its Euler characteristic is equal to the \mathfrak{sl}(N) polynomial of the graph evaluated at 1. We extend their results to graphs with arbitrary colourings by irreducible anti-symmetric representations of \mathfrak{sl}(N).
