Cobordism of Haken n-manifolds is defined by a Haken (n+1)-manifold W whose boundary has two components, each of which is a closed Haken n-manifold. In addition, the inclusion map of the fundamental group of each boundary component to \pi_1(W) is injective. In this paper we prove that there are 4-dimensional Haken cobordisms whose boundary consists of any two closed Haken 3-manifolds. In particular, each closed Haken 3-manifold is the \pi_1-injective boundary of some Haken 4-manifold.
