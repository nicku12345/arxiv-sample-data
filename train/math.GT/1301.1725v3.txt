We consider the question of when is the closed manifold obtained by elementary surgery on an n-knot Seifert fibred over a 2-orbifold. After some observations on the classical case, we concentrate on the cases n=2 and 3. We have found a new family of 2-knots with torsion-free, solvable group, overlooked in earlier work. We know of no higher dimensional examples.
