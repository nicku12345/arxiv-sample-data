We show that the resulting manifold by r-surgery on a large class of two-bridge knots has left-orderable fundamental group if the slope r satisfies certain conditions. This result gives a supporting evidence to a conjecture of Boyer, Gordon and Watson that relates L-spaces and the left-orderability of their fundamental groups.
