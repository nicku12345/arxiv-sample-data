Given a hyperbolic subgroup H of a hyperbolic group G for which a Cannon-Thurston map \hat i:\partial H \ra \partial G exists, we study the limit set \Lambda_H of H with respect to its action on \partial G. We prove that the set of conical limit points is exactly the subset of \Lambda_H consisting of the points to which the Cannon-Thurston map \hat i injects. Moreover, we show that when H is not quasi-convex in G, there exists a non-conical limit point in \Lambda_H
