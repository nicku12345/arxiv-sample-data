Given an Anosov representation \rho \colon \pi_1(S) \to \PSL_{n}(\mathbb{R}) and a maximal geodesic lamination \lambda in a surface S, we construct shear deformations along the leaves of the geodesic lamination \lambda endowed with a certain flag decoration, that is provided by the associated flag curve \mathcal{F}_\rho\colon \Sinf \to \mathrm{Flag}(\mathbb{R}^n) of the Anosov representation \rho; these deformations generalize to Labourie's Anosov representations Thurston's cataclysms for hyperbolic structures on surfaces. A cataclysm is parametrized by a transverse n--twisted cocycle for the orientation cover \La of \lambda. In addition, we establish various geometric properties for these deformations. Among others, we prove a variation formula for the associated length functions \ell^i_\rho of the Anosov representation \rho.
