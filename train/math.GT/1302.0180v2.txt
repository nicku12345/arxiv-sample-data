We prove that any diagram of the unknot with c crossings may be reduced to the trivial diagram using at most (236 c)^{11} Reidemeister moves. Moreover, every diagram in this sequence has at most (7 c)^2 crossings. We also prove a similar theorem for split links, which provides a polynomial upper bound on the number of Reidemeister moves required to transform a diagram of the link into a disconnected diagram.
