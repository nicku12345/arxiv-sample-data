In this paper, we construct spines, i.e., \Mod_g-equivariant deformation retracts, of the Teichm\"uller space \T_g of compact Riemann surfaces of genus g. Specifically, we define a \Mod_g-stable subspace S of positive codimension and construct an intrinsic \Mod_g-equivariant deformation retraction from \T_g to S. As an essential part of the proof, we construct a canonical \Mod_g-deformation retraction of the Teichm\"uller space \T_g to its thick part \T_g(\varepsilon) when \varepsilon is sufficiently small. These equivariant deformation retracts of \T_g give cocompact models of the universal space \underline{E}\Mod_g for proper actions of the mapping class group \Mod_g. These deformation retractions of \T_g are motivated by the well-rounded deformation retraction of the space of lattices in \R^n. We also include a summary of results and difficulties of an unpublished paper of Thurston on a potential spine of the Teichm\"uller space.
