We study the twisted Alexander polynomial \Delta_{K,\rho} of a knot K associated to a non-abelian representation \rho of the knot group into SL_2(\BC). It is known for every knot K that if K is fibered, then for every non-abelian representation, \Delta_{K,\rho} is monic and has degree 4g(K)-2 where g(K) is the genus of K. Kim and Morifuji recently proved the converse for 2-bridge knots. In fact they proved a stronger result: if a 2-bridge knot K is non-fibered, then all but finitely many non-abelian representations on some component have \Delta_{K,\rho} non-monic and degree 4g(K)-2. In this paper, we consider two special families of non-fibered 2-bridge knots including twist knots. For these families, we calculate the number of non-abelian representations where \Delta_{K,\rho} is monic and calculate the number of non-abelian representations where the degree of \Delta_{K,\rho} is less than 4g(K)-2.
