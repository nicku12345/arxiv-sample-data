In this paper, we prove than given two cubic knots K_1, K_2 in \mathbb{R}^3, they are isotopic if and only if one can pass from one to the other by a finite sequence of cubulated moves. These moves are analogous to the Reidemeister moves for classical tame knots. We use the fact that a cubic knot is determined by a cyclic permutation of contiguous vertices of the \mathbb{Z}^3-lattice (with some restrictions), to describe some of the classic invariants and properties of the knots in terms of such cyclic permutations, by projecting onto a plane such that it is injective when restricted to the \mathbb{Z}^3-lattice and the image of the \mathbb{Z}^3-lattice is dense.
