Turaev showed that there is a well-defined map assigning to an oriented link L in the three-sphere a Spin structure t_0 on Sigma(L), the 2-fold cover of S^3 branched along L. We prove, generalizing results of Manolescu-Owens and Donald-Owens, that for an oriented quasi-alternating link L the signature of L equals minus four times the Heegaard Floer correction term of (Sigma(L), t_0).
