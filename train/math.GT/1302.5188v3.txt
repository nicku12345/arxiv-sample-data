In this paper, we prove that   (1) For any integers n\geq 1 and g\geq 2, there is a closed 3-manifold M_{g}^{n} which admits a distance n Heegaard splitting of genus g except that the pair of (g, n) is (2, 1). Furthermore, M_{g}^{n} can be chosen to be hyperbolic except that the pair of (g, n) is (3, 1).   (2) For any integers g\geq 2 and n\geq 4, there are infinitely many non-homeomorphic closed 3-manifolds admitting distance n Heegaard splittings of genus g.
