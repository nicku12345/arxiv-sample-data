In this paper we prove several related results concerning smooth \Z_p or \s^1 actions on 4-manifolds. We show that there exists an infinite sequence of smooth 4-manifolds X_n, n\geq 2, which have the same integral homology and intersection form and the same Seiberg-Witten invariant, such that each X_n supports no smooth \s^1-actions but admits a smooth \Z_n-action. In order to construct such manifolds, we devise a method for annihilating smooth \s^1-actions on 4-manifolds using Fintushel-Stern knot surgery, and apply it to the Kodaira-Thurston manifold in an equivariant setting. Finally, the method for annihilating smooth \s^1-actions relies on a new obstruction we derived in this paper for existence of smooth \s^1-actions on a 4-manifold: the fundamental group of a smooth \s^1-four-manifold with nonzero Seiberg-Witten invariant must have infinite center. We also include a discussion on various analogous or related results in the literature, including locally linear actions or smooth actions in dimensions other than four.
