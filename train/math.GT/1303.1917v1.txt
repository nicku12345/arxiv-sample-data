Suppose that f is a homomorphism from the mapping class group \mathcal{M}(N_{g,n}) of a nonorientable surface of genus g with n boundary components, to \mathrm{GL}(m,\mathbb{C}). We prove that if g\ge 5, n\le 1 and m\le g-2, then f factors through the abelianization of \mathcal{M}(N_{g,n}), which is \mathbb{Z}_2\times\mathbb{Z}_2 for g\in\{5,6\} and \mathbb{Z}_2 for g\ge 7. If g\ge 7, n=0 and m=g-1, then either f has finite image (of order at most two if g\ne 8), or it is conjugate to one of four "homological representations". As an application we prove that for g\ge 5 and h<g, every homomorphism \mathcal{M}(N_{g,0})\to\mathcal{M}(N_{h,0}) factors through the abelianization of \mathcal{M}(N_{g,0}).
