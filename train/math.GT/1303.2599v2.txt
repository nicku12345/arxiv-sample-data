Given any diagram of a link, we define on the cube of Kauffman's states a "2-complex" whose homology is an invariant of the associated framed links, and such that the graded Euler characteristic reproduces the unnormalized Kauffman bracket. This includes a categorification of brackets skein relation. Then we incorporate the orientation information and get a further complex on the same cube that gives rise to a new invariant homology for oriented links, so that the graded Euler characteristic reproduces the unnormalized Jones polynomial in Kauffman's version. Finally we clarify the relations between this homology and the original Khovanov homology of oriented links, extending the well known relation between the associated two versions of the Jones polynomial.
