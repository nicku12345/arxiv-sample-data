Let M be a complete oriented hyperbolic 3--manifold of finite volume. Using classifying spaces for families of subgroups we construct a class \beta_P(M) in the Adamson relative homology group H_3([PSL_2(\mathbb{C}):\bar{P}];\mathbb{Z}), where \bar{P} is the subgroup of parabolic transformations which fix \infty in the Riemann sphere. We also prove that the classes F(M) in the Takasu relative homology groups H_3(PSL_2(\mathbb{C}),\bar{P};\mathbb{Z}) constructed by Zickert, which are not well-defined and depend of a choice of decorations by horospheres, are all mapped to \beta_P(M) via a canonical comparison homomorphism H_3(PSL_2(\mathbb{C}),\bar{P};\mathbb{Z})\to H_3([PSL_2(\mathbb{C}):\bar{P}];\mathbb{Z}). To do this, we simplify the construction of the classes F(M) using a simpler complex which computes H_3(PSL_2(\mathbb{C}),\bar{P};\mathbb{Z}), getting a simple simplicial formula for F(M), which in turn gives a simpler and more efficient formula to compute the volume and Chern--Simons invariant than the one given by Zickert. The constructions can be extended for any boundary-parabolic PSL_2(\mathbb{C})-representation.
