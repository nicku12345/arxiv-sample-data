A recent paper (\cite{BJM}) by Biringer, Johnson, and Minsky prove that any pseudo-Anosov whose stable lamination is the limit of disks in a compression body has a power which extends over some non-trivial minimal compression body. This paper presents an alternative proof of their theorem, using techniques of Long and Casson which first appeared in \cite{CL} and \cite{L}. The key ingredient is the existence of a certain collection of disks whose boundaries are formed from an arc of the stable lamination and an arc of the unstable lamination. Furthermore, the proof here shows that there are only finitely many minimal compression bodies over which a power of a pseudo-Anosov can extend.
