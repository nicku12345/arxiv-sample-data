We introduce a diffeomorphism invariant of 4-manifolds, the \mathrm{Pin}^-(2)-monopole invariant, defined by using the \mathrm{Pin}^-(2)-monopole equations. We compute the invariants of several 4-manifolds, and prove gluing formulae. By using the invariants, we construct exotic smooth structures on the connected sum of an elliptic surface E(n) with arbitrary number of the 4-manifolds of the form of S^2\times\Sigma or S^1\times Y where \Sigma is a compact Riemann surface with positive genus and Y is a closed 3-manifold. As another application, we give an estimate of the genus of surfaces embedded in a 4-manifold X representing a class \alpha\in H_2(X;l), where l is a local coefficient on X.
