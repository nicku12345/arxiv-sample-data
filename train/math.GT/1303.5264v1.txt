We show that a graph manifold which is a Z-homology 3-sphere not homeomorphic to either the 3-sphere or the Poincar\'e homology 3-sphere admits a horizontal foliation. This combines with known results to show that the conditions of not being an L-space, of having a left-orderable fundamental group, and of admitting a co-oriented taut foliation, are equivalent for graph manifold Z-homology 3-spheres.
