Let \alpha be a Morse closed 1-form of a smooth n-dimensional manifold M. The zeroes of \alpha of index 0 or n are called \emph{centers}. It is known that every non-vanishing de Rham cohomology class u contains a Morse representative without centers. The result of this paper is the one-parameter analogue of the last statement: every generic path  (\alpha_t)_{t\in [0,1]} of closed 1-forms in a fixed class u\neq 0 such that \alpha_0, \alpha_1 have no centers, can be modified relatively to its extremities to another such path  (\beta_t)_{t\in [0,1]} having no center at all.
