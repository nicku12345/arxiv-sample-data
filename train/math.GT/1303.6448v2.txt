This is an introductory article about the Boy surface. Boy found 1901 that \mathbb{R}P^2 can be immersed into \mathbb{R}^3, and published it. (The image of) the immersion is called the Boy surface after Boy's discovery. We have created a way to construct the Boy surface by using a pair of scissors, a piece of paper, and a strip of scotch tape. In this article we introduce the way. Furthermore, we make a movie to show the paper-craft actually, and put it in a website. One can find the website by typing in the author's name or the title of this article in the search engine.
