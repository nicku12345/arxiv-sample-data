If a rectangular diagram represents the trivial knot, then it can be deformed into the rectangular diagram with only two vertical edges by a finite sequence of merge operations and exchange operations, without increasing the number of vertical edges, which was shown by I. A. Dynnikov.   We show in this paper that we need no merge operations to deform a rectangular diagram of the trivial knot to one with no crossings.
