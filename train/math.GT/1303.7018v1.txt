In a 3-manifold M, let K be a knot and R be an annulus which meets K transversely. We define the notion of the pair (R,K) being caught by a surface Q in the exterior of the link given by K and the boundary curves of R. For a caught pair (R,K), we consider the knot K^n gotten by twisting K n times along R and give a lower bound on the bridge number of K^n with respect to Heegaard splittings of M -- as a function of n, the genus of the splitting, and the catching surface Q. As a result, the bridge number of K^n tends to infinity with n. In application, we look at a family of knots K^n found by Teragaito that live in a small Seifert fiber space M and where each K^n admits a Dehn surgery giving the 3-sphere. We show that the bridge number of K^n with respect to any genus 2 Heegaard splitting of M tends to infinity with n. This contrasts with other work of the authors as well as with the conjectured picture for knots in lens spaces that admit Dehn surgeries giving the 3-sphere.
