Lomonaco and Kauffman introduced a knot mosaic system to give a definition of a quantum knot system which can be viewed as a blueprint for the construction of an actual physical quantum system. A knot n-mosaic is an n \times n matrix of 11 kinds of specific mosaic tiles representing a knot or a link by adjoining properly that is called suitably connected. D_n denotes the total number of all knot n-mosaics. Already known is that D_1=1, D_2=2, and D_3=22. In this paper we establish the lower and upper bounds on D_n \frac{2}{275}(9 \cdot 6^{n-2} + 1)^2 \cdot 2^{(n-3)^2} \ \leq \ D_n \ \leq \ \frac{2}{275}(9 \cdot 6^{n-2} + 1)^2 \cdot (4.4)^{(n-3)^2}. and find the exact number of D_4 = 2594.
