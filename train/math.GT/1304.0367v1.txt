We examine certain symmetries in the deficiencies of a rational surgery on a knot in S^3 by comparing the \text{Spin}^c-structures on the rational surgery with those on a related integral surgery. We then provide an application of these symmetries in the form of a theorem that obstructs Dehn surgeries in S^3. This last part unifies and generalises theorems by Greene underlying his work on the cabling conjecture, the lens space realisation problem, and the unknotting number of alternating 3-braids.
