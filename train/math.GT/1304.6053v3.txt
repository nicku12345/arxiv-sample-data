This is an introductory article on high dimensional knots for the beginners. High dimensional knot theory is an exciting field. It is a field of knot theory, which is one of topology and is connected with many ones. In this article we use few literal expressions, equations, functions, etc. We barely suppose that the readers have studied manifolds, homology theory, or topics beyond them.   Is there a nontrivial high dimensional knot? We first answer this question. After that, we explain local moves on high dimensional knots and the projections of high dimensional knots.
