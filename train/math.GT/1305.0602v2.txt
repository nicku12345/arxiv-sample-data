Bing doubling is an operation which gives a satellite of a knot. It is also applied to a link by specifying a component of the link. We give a formula to compute the reduced colored Jones polynomial of a Bing double by using that of the companion. This formula enables us to compute a lot of examples of the reduced colored Jones polynomial of Bing doubles. Moreover, from this formula we can derive a divisibility property of the unified Witten-Reshetikhin-Turaev invariant of integral homology spheres obtained by \pm1 surgery along Bing doubles of knots. This result is applied to the Witten-Reshetikhin-Turaev invariant and the Ohtsuki series of these integral homology spheres.
