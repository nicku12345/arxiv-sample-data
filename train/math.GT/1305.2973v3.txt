We define the notion of a braided link cobordism in S^3 \times [0,1], which generalizes Viro's closed surface braids in \mathbb{R}^4. We prove that any properly embedded oriented surface W \subset S^3 \times [0,1] is isotopic to a surface in this special position, and that the isotopy can be taken rel boundary when \partial W already consists of closed braids. These surfaces are closely related to another notion of surface braiding in D^2 \times D^2, called braided surfaces with caps, which are a generalization of Rudolph's braided surfaces. We mention several applications of braided surfaces with caps, including using them to apply algebraic techniques from braid groups to studying surfaces in 4-space, as well as constructing singular fibrations on smooth 4-manifolds from a given handle decomposition.
