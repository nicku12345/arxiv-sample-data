We give an algorithm to compute the stable lengths of pseudo-Anosovs on the curve graph, answering a question of Bowditch. We also give a procedure to compute all invariant tight geodesic axes of pseudo-Anosovs.   Along the way we show that there are constants 1<a_1<a_2 such that the minimal upper bound on `slices' of tight geodesics is bounded below and above by a_1^{\xi(S)} and a_2^{\xi(S)}, where \xi(S) is the complexity of the surface. As a consequence, we give the first computable bounds on the asymptotic dimension of curve graphs and mapping class groups.   Our techniques involve a generalization of Masur--Minsky's tight geodesics and a new class of paths on which their tightening procedure works.
