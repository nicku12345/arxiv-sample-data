For an oriented surface link F in \mathbb{R}^4, we consider a satellite construction of a surface link, called a 2-dimensional braid over F, which is in the form of a covering over F. We introduce the notion of an m-chart on a surface diagram \pi(F)\subset \mathbb{R}^3 of F, which is a finite graph on \pi(F) satisfying certain conditions and is an extended notion of an m-chart on a 2-disk presenting a surface braid. A 2-dimensional braid over F is presented by an m-chart on \pi(F). It is known that two surface links are equivalent if and only if their surface diagrams are related by a finite sequence of ambient isotopies of \mathbb{R}^3 and local moves called Roseman moves. We show that Roseman moves for surface diagrams with m-charts can be well-defined.
