We correct and complete a conjecture of D. Gabai, R. Meyerhoff and N. Thurston on the classification and properties of thin tubed closed hyperbolic 3-manifolds. We additionally show that if N is a closed hyperbolic 3-manifold, then either N=Vol3 or N contains a closed geodesic that is the core of an embedded tube of radius log(3)/2.
