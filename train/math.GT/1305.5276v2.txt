Thurston introduced a technique for finding and deforming three-dimensional hyperbolic structures by gluing together ideal tetrahedra. We generalize this technique to study families of geometric structures that transition from hyperbolic to anti de Sitter (AdS) geometry. Our approach involves solving Thurston's gluing equations over several different shape parameter algebras. In the case of a punctured torus bundle with Anosov monodromy, we identify two components of real solutions for which there are always nearby positively oriented solutions over both the complex and pseudo-complex numbers. These complex and pseudo-complex solutions define hyperbolic and AdS structures that, after coordinate change in the projective model, may be arranged into one continuous family of real projective structures. We also study the rigidity properties of certain AdS structures with tachyon singularities.
