In this work we present a complete (no misses, no duplicates) census for closed, connected, orientable and prime 3-manifolds induced by plane graphs with a bipartition of its edge set (blinks) up to k=9 edges. Blinks form a universal encoding for such manifolds. In fact, each such a manifold is a subtle class of blinks, \cite{lins2013B}. Blinks are in 1-1 correpondence with {\em blackboard framed links}, \cite {kauffman1991knots, kauffman1994tlr} We hope that this census becomes as useful for the study of concrete examples of 3-manifolds as the tables of knots are in the study of knots and links.
