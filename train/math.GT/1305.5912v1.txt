Each free homotopy class of directed closed curves on a surface with boundary can be described by a cyclic reduced word in the generators of the fundamental group and their inverses. The word length is the number of letters of the cyclic word.   If the surface has a hyperbolic metric with geodesic boundary, the geometric length of the class is the length of the unique geodesic.   By computer experiments, we investigate the distribution of the geometric length among all classes with a given word length in the pair of pants surface. Our experiments strongly suggest that the distribution is normal.
