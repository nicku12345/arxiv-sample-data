Given a 2-stranded tangle in a \ZZ/2 homology ball, T\subset Y, we investigate the character variety R(Y,T) of conjugacy classes of traceless SU(2) representations of \pi_1(Y\setminus T). In particular we completely determine the subspace of binary dihedral representations, and identify all of R(Y,T) for many tangles naturally associated to knots in S^3. Moreover, we determine the image of the restriction map from R(T,Y) to the traceless SU(2) character variety of the 4-punctured 2-sphere (the {\it pillowcase}). We give examples to show this image can be non-linear in general, and show it is linear for tangles associated to pretzel knots.
