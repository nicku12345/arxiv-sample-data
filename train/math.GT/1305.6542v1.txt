In this paper we will show that two surfaces of the same genus and homology class in a simply connected 4-manifold are concordant. We will show they are often topologically isotopic when their complements have cyclic fundamental group. Finally, we will show that if they are 0-concordant, then surgery on one is equivalent to surgery on the other.
