Closed 3-string braids admit many bandings to two-bridge links. By way of the Montesinos Trick, this allows us to construct infinite families of knots in the connected sum of lens spaces L(r,1) # L(s,1) that admit a surgery to a lens space for all pairs of integers (r,s) except (0,0). These knots are typically hyperbolic. We also demonstrate that the previously known two families of examples of hyperbolic knots in non-prime manifolds with lens space surgeries of Eudave-Munoz--Wu and Kang all fit this construction. As such, we propose a generalization of the Cabling Conjecture of Gonzales-Acuna--Short for knots in lens spaces.
