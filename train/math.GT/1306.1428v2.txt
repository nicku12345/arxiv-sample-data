Let S_{g,p} denote the genus g orientable surface with p punctures. We show that nested train track sequences constitute O((g,p)^{2})-quasiconvex subsets of the curve graph, effectivizing a theorem of Masur and Minsky. As a consequence, the genus g disk set is O(g^{2})-quasiconvex. We also show that splitting and sliding sequences of birecurrent train tracks project to O((g,p)^{2})-unparameterized quasi-geodesics in the curve graph of any essential subsurface, an effective version of a theorem of Masur, Mosher, and Schleimer.
