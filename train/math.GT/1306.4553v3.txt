The Lorentzian length, which is one of the most significant functions in Lorentzian geometry, is a complex-valued function. Its square gives a real-valued non-degenerate quadratic function. In this paper, we define naturally extended mappings of Lorentzian distance-squared functions, wherein each component is a Lorentzian distance-squared function; and classify these mappings completely by the likeness of recognition subspaces.
