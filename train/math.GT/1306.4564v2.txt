We give uniform, explicit, and simple face-pairing descriptions of all the branched cyclic covers of the 3-sphere, branched over two-bridge knots. Our method is to use the bi-twisted face-pairing constructions of Cannon, Floyd, and Parry; these examples show that the bi-twist construction is often efficient and natural. Finally, we give applications to computations of fundamental groups and homology of these branched cyclic covers.
