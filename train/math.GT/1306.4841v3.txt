This paper gives a combinatorial description of spin and spin^c-structures on triangulated PL-manifolds of arbitrary dimension. These formulations of spin and spin^c-structures are established primarily for the purpose of aiding in computations. The novelty of the approach is we rely heavily on the naturality of binary symmetric groups to avoid lengthy explicit constructions of smoothings of PL-manifolds.
