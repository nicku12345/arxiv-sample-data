A triangulated d-manifold K, satisfies the inequality \binom{f_0(K)-d-1}{2}\geq \binom{d+2}{2}\beta_1(K;\mathbb{Z}_2) for d\geq 3. The triangulated d-manifolds that meet the bound with equality are called {\em tight neighborly}. In this paper, we present tight neighborly triangulations of 4-manifolds on 15 vertices with \mathbb{Z}_3 as automorphism group. One such example wasconstructed by Bagchi and Datta in 2011. We show that there are exactly 12 such triangulations up to isomorphism, 10 of which are orientable.
