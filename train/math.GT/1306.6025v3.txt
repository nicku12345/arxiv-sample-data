Let C(L) be the right-angled Coxeter group defined by an abstract triangulation L of \mathbb{S}^2. We show that C(L) is isomorphic to a hyperbolic right-angled reflection group if and only if L can be realized as an acute triangulation. The proof relies on the theory of CAT(-1) spaces. A corollary is that an abstract triangulation of \mathbb{S}^2 can be realized as an acute triangulation exactly when it satisfies a combinatorial condition called "flag no-square". We also study generalizations of this result to other angle bounds, other planar surfaces and other dimensions.
