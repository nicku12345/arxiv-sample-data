Given a sequence of oriented links L^1,L^2,L^3,... each of which has a distinguished, unknotted component, there is a decomposition of the 3-sphere naturally associated to it, which is constructed as the components of the intersection of an infinite sequence of nested solid tori. The Bing and Whitehead continua are simple, well known examples. We give a necessary and sufficient criterion to determine whether such a decomposition is shrinkable, generalising previous work of F. Ancel and M. Starbird and others. This criterion can effectively determine, in many cases, whether the quotient map which identifies the elements of the decomposition to points can be approximated by homeomorphisms.
