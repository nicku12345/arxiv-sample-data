We introduce a new technique for studying classical knots with the methods of virtual knot theory. Let K be a knot and J a knot in the complement of K with \text{lk}(J,K)=0. Suppose there is covering space \pi_J: \Sigma \times (0,1) \to \bar{S^3\backslash V(J)}, where V(J) is a regular neighborhood of J satisfying V(J) \cap \text{im}(K)=\emptyset and \Sigma is a connected compact orientable 2-manifold. Let K' be a knot in \Sigma \times (0,1) such that \pi_J(K')=K. Then K' stabilizes to a virtual knot \hat{K}, called a virtual cover of K relative to J. We investigate what can be said about a classical knot from its virtual covers in the case that J is a fibered knot. Several examples and applications to classical knots are presented. A basic theory of virtual covers is established.
