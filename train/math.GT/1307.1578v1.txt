In this paper, we study distribution of the zeros of the Alexander polynomials of knots and links in S^3. We call a knot or link "real stable" (resp. "circular stable") if all the zeros of its Alexander polynomial are real (resp. unit complex). We give a general construction of real stable and circular stable knots and links. We also study pairs of real stable knots and links such that the zeros of the Alexander polynomials are interlaced.
