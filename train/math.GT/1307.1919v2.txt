Given a closed hyperbolic 3-manifold M of volume V, and a link L in M such that the complement M \ L is hyperbolic, we establish a bound for the systole length of M \ L in terms of V. This extends a result of Adams and Reid, who showed that in the case that M is not hyperbolic, there is a universal bound of 7.35534... . As part of the proof, we establish a bound for the systole length of a non-compact finite volume hyperbolic manifold which grows asymptotically like (4/3)log(V).
