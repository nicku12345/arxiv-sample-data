Let be given a {\em colored 3-pseudo-triangulation} \mathcal{H}^\star with n tetrahedra. Colored means that each tetrahedron have vertices distinctively colored 0,1,2,3. In a {\em pseudo} 3-triangulation the intersection of simplices might be subsets of simplices of smaller dimensions (faces), instead of a single maximal face, as for true triangulations. If \mathcal{H}^\star is the dual of a cell 3-complex induced (in an specific way to be made clear) by a pair of Jordan curves with 2n transversal crossings, then we show that the induced 3-manifold |\mathcal{H}^\star| is \mathbb{S}^3 and we make available an O(n^2)-algorithm to produce a PL-embedding (\cite{rourke1982introduction}) of \mathcal{H}^\star into \mathbb{S}^3. This bound is rather surprising because such PL-embeddings are often of exponential size. This work is the first step towards obtaining, via an O(n^ 2)-algorithm, a framed link presentation inducing the same closed orientable 3-manifold as the one given by a colored pseudo-triangulation.

However, the exposition and the new proofs of this paper are meant to be entirely self-contained.
