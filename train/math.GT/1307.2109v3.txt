A {\em blink} is a plane graph with a bipartition (black, gray) of its edges. Subtle classes of blinks are in 1-1 correspondence with closed, oriented and connected 3-manifolds up to orientation preserving homeomorphisms \cite{lins2013B}. Switching black and gray in a blink B, giving -B, reverses the manifold orientation. The dual of the blink B in the sphere \mathbb{S}^2 is denoted by B^ \star. Blinks B and -B^\star induce the same 3-manifold. The paper reinforces the Conjecture that if B' \notin \{B,-B^\star\}, then the monochromatic 3-connected (mono3c) blinks B and B' induce distinct 3-manifolds. Using homology of covers and length spectra, we conclude the topological classification of 708 mono3c blinks that were organized in equivalence classes by WRT-invariants in \cite{lins2007blink}. We also present a reformulation of the combinatorial algorithm to obtain the WRT-invariants of \cite{lins1995gca} using only the blink.
