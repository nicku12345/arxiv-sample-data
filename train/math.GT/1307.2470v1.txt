It is well known that the collection of uniformizations of a closed Riemann surface S is partially ordered; the lowest ones are the Schottky unformizations, that is, tuples (\Omega,\Gamma,P:\Omega \to S), where \Gamma is a Schottky group with region of discontinuity \Omega and P:\Omega \to S is a regular holomorphic cover map with \Gamma as its deck group.   Let \tau:S \to S be a conformal (respectively, anticonformal) automorphism of S of finite order n, and let (\Omega,\Gamma,P:\Omega \to S) be a Schottky uniformization of S. Assume that \tau lifts with respect to the previous Schottky uniformization, that is, there exists a M\"obius (respectively, extended M\"obius) transformation \kappa, keeping \Omega invariant, with P \circ \kappa=\tau \circ P. The Kleinian (respectively, extended Kleinian) group K=< \Gamma, \kappa > contains \Gamma as a finite index normal subgroup and K/\Gamma \cong {\mathbb Z}_{n}. We provide a structural picture of K in terms of the Klein-Maskit's combination theorems and some basic groups. Some consequences are (i) the determination of the number of topologically different types of such groups (fixed n and the rank of the Schottky normal subgroup) and (ii) for n prime, the number of normal Schottky normal subgroups, up to conjugacy, that K has.
