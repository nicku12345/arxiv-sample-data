Let M=H_1\cup_S H_2 be a Heegaard splitting of a closed orientable 3-manifold M (or a bridge decomposition of a link exterior). Consider the subgroup \mathrm{MCG}^0(H_j) of the mapping class group of H_j consisting of mapping classes represented by auto-homeomorphisms of H_j homotopic to the identity, and let G_j be the subgroup of the automorphism group of the curve complex \mathcal{CC}(S) obtained as the image of \mathrm{MCG}^0(H_j). Then the group G=<G_1, G_2> generated by G_1 and G_2 preserve the homotopy class in M of simple loops on S. In this paper, we study the structure of the group G and the problem to what extent the converse to this observation holds.
