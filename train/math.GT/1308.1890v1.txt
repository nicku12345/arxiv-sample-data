It has been recently conjectured by Boyer-Gordon-Watson that a closed, orientable, irreducible 3-manifold M is a Heegaard Floer L-space if and only if \pi_1(M) is not left-orderable. In this article, we study this conjecture from the point of view of lattice cohomology, an invariant introduced by N\'emethi which is conjecturally isomorphic to the HF^+ version of Heegaard Floer homology. Using the invariant's combinatorial tractability as a stepping stone, we produce some interesting quite general families of negative-definite graph manifolds against which to test the Boyer-Gordon-Watson conjecture. Then, using horizontal foliation arguments and direct manipulation of the fundamental group, we prove that these families do indeed satisfy the conjecture.
