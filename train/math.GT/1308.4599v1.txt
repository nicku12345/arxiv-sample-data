Kevin Hartshorn showed that if a three-dimensional manifold M admits a Heegaard surface \Sigma with Hempel distance d then every incompressible surface in M has genus at least \frac{d}{2}. Scharlemann-Tomova generalized this, proving that in such a manifold, every other Heegaard surface for M of genus g' < \frac{d}{2} is a stabilization of \Sigma. In the present paper, we show that Hartshorn's bound is sharp and Scharlemann-Tomova's bound is very close to sharp. In particular, for every pair of integers g \geq 2, d \geq 2, we construct a three-manifold M with a genus g, distance d Heegaard splitting and an incompressible surface of genus \frac{d}{2}. We also construct, for every d \geq 4, a three-manifold with a genus g, distance d Heegaard surface \Sigma and a second Heegaard surface with genus g' = \frac{1}{2} d + g - 1 that is not a stabilization of \Sigma.
