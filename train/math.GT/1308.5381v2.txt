We give a shorter proof of the following theorem of Kathryn Mann \cite{M}: the identity component of the group of the compactly supported C^r diffeomorphisms of \R^n cannot admit a nontrivial C^p-action on S^1, provided n\geq2, r\neq n+1 and p\geq2. We also give a new proof of another theorem of Mann: any nontrivial endomorphism of the group of the orientation preserving C^r diffeomorphisms of the circle is the conjugation by a C^r diffeomorphism, if r\geq3.
