The splitting number of a link is the minimal number of crossing changes between different components required, on any diagram, to convert it to a split link. We introduce new techniques to compute the splitting number, involving covering links and Alexander invariants. As an application, we completely determine the splitting numbers of links with 9 or fewer crossings. Also, with these techniques, we either reprove or improve upon the lower bounds for splitting numbers of links computed by J. Batson and C. Seed using Khovanov homology.
