We have introduced the weight of a group which has a presentation with number of relations is at most the number of generators. We have shown that the number of facets of any contracted pseudotriangulation of a connected closed 3-manifold M is at least the weight of \pi(M, \ast). This lower bound is sharp for the 3-manifolds \mathbb{R P}^3, L(3,1), L(5,2), S^1\times S^1 \times S^1, S^2 \times S^1, S^2 \mbox{\times \hspace{-2.8mm}_{-}} S^1 and S^3/Q_8, where Q_8 is the quaternion group. Moreover, there is a unique such facet minimal pseudotriangulation in each of these seven cases. We have also constructed contracted pseudotriangulations of L(kq-1,q) with 4(q+k-1) facets for q \geq 3, k \geq 2 and L(kq+1,q) with 4(q+k) facets for q\geq 4, k\geq 1. By a recent result of Swartz, our pseudotriangulations of L(kq+1, q) are facet minimal when kq+1 are even. In 1979, Gagliardi found presentations of the fundamental group of a manifold M in terms of a contracted pseudotriangulation of M. Our construction is the converse of this, namely, given a presentation of the fundamental group of a 3-manifold M, we construct a contracted pseudotriangulation of M. So, our construction of a contracted pseudotriangulation of a 3-manifold M is based on a presentation of the fundamental group of M and it is computer-free.
