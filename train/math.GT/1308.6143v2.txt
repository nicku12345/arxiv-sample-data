The braided Thompson group \mathcal B is an asymptotic mapping class group of a sphere punctured along the standard Cantor set, endowed with a rigid structure. Inspired from the case of finite type surfaces we consider a Hatcher-Thurston cell complex whose vertices are asymptotically trivial pants decompositions. We prove that the automorphism group \hat{\mathcal B^{\frac{1}{2}}} of this complex is also an asymptotic mapping class group in a weaker sense. Moreover \hat{\mathcal B^{\frac{1}{2}}} is obtained by \mathcal B by first adding new elements called half-twists and further completing it.
