We give an example of a 3-component smoothly slice boundary link, each of whose components has a genus one Seifert surface, such that any metaboliser of the boundary link Seifert form is represented by 3 curves on the Seifert surfaces that form a link with nonvanishing Milnor triple linking number. We also give a generalisation to m-component links and higher Milnor invariants. We prove that our examples are ribbon and that all ribbon links are boundary slice.
