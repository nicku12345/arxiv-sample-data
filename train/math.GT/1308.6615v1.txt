As demonstrated by Croke and Kleiner, the visual boundary of a CAT(0) group is not well-defined since quasi-isometric CAT(0) spaces can have non-homeomorphic boundaries. We introduce a new type of boundary for a CAT(0) space, called the contracting boundary, made up rays satisfying one of five hyperbolic-like properties. We prove that these properties are all equivalent and that the contracting boundary is a quasi-isometry invariant. We use this invariant to distinguish the quasi-isometry classes of certain right-angled Coxeter groups.
