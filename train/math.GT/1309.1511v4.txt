In this paper, we will use Kahn-Markovic's almost totally geodesic surfaces to construct certain \pi_1-injective 2-complexes in closed hyperbolic 3-manifolds. Such 2-complexes are locally almost totally geodesic except along a 1-dimensional subcomplex. Using Agol and Wise's result that fundamental groups of hyperbolic 3-manifolds are LERF and quasi-convex subgroups are virtual retract, we will show that closed hyperbolic 3-manifolds virtually contain any prescribed homological torsion: For any finite abelian group A, and any closed hyperbolic 3-manifold M, there exists a finite cover N of M, such that A is a direct summand of Tor(H_1(N;\mathbb{Z})).
