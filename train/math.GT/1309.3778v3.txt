On a compact oriented surface of genus g with n\geq 1 boundary components, \delta_1, \delta_2,\ldots, \delta_n, we consider positive factorizations of the boundary multitwist t_{\delta_1} t_{\delta_2} \cdots t_{\delta_n}, where t_{\delta_i} is the positive Dehn twist about the boundary \delta_i. We prove that for g\geq 3, the boundary multitwist t_{\delta_1} t_{\delta_2} can be written as a product of arbitrarily large number of positive Dehn twists about nonseparating simple closed curves, extending a recent result of Baykur and Van Horn-Morris, who proved this result for g\geq 8. This fact has immediate corollaries on the Euler characteristics of the Stein fillings of conctact three manifolds.
