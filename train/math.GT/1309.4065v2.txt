We build an augmentation of the Masur-Minsky marking complex by Groves-Manning combinatorial horoballs to obtain a graph we call the augmented marking complex, \mathcal{AM}(S). Adapting work of Masur-Minsky, we prove that \mathcal{AM}(S) is quasiisometric to Teichm\"uller space with the Teichm\"uller metric. A similar construction was independently discovered by Eskin-Masur-Rafi. We also completely integrate the Masur-Minsky hierarchy machinery to \mathcal{AM}(S) to build flexible families of uniform quasigeodesics in Teichm\"uller space. As an application, we give a new proof of Rafi's distance formula for the Teichm\"uller metric.
