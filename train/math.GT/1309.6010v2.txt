Let M be an orientable, cusped hyperbolic 3-manifold of finite volume. We show that the restriction map from a Dehn surgery component in the PSL(2,C)-character variety of M to the character variety of the boundary of M is a birational isomorphism onto its image. This generalises a result by Nathan Dunfield. A key step in our proof is the exactness of Craig Hodgson's volume differential on the eigenvalue variety.
