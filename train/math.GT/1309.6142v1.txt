We show that closed 3-manifolds with high Heegaard distance and bounded subsurface Heegaard distance are primitive stable when they are regarded as representations from the free group corresponding to the handlebody. This implies that any point on the boundary of Schottky space can be approximated by primitive stable representations corresponding to closed hyperbolic 3-manifolds.
