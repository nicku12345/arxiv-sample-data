Skeletal signatures were introduced in [J W Anderson and A Wootton, A Lower Bound for the Number of Group Actions on a Compact Riemann Surface, Algebr. Geom. Topol. 12 (2012) 19--35.] as a tool to describe the space of all signatures with which a group can act on a surface of genus \sigma \geq 2. In the present paper we provide a complete description of the gaps that appear in the space of skeletal signatures, together with proofs of the conjectures posed in our earlier work.
