We establish three rank inequalities for the reduced flavor of Heegaard Floer homology of Seifert fibered integral homology spheres. Combining these inequalities with the known classifications of non-zero degree maps between Seifert fibered spaces, we prove that a map f from Y' to Y between Seifert homology spheres yields the inequality that |deg f| rank HFred(Y) is at most rank HFred(Y'). These inequalities are also applied in conjunction with an algorithm of Nemethi to give a method to solve the botany problem for the Heegaard Floer homology of these manifolds.
