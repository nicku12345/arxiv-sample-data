Suppose that a hyperbolic knot in S^3 admits a finite surgery, Boyer and Zhang proved that the surgery slope must be either integral or half-integral, and they conjectured that the latter case does not happen. Using the correction terms in Heegaard Floer homology, we prove that if a hyperbolic knot in S^3 admits a half-integral finite surgery, then the knot must have the same knot Floer homology as one of eight non-hyperbolic knots which are known to admit such surgeries, and the resulting manifold must be one of ten spherical space forms. As knot Floer homology carries a lot of information about the knot, this gives a strong evidence to Boyer--Zhang's conjecture.
