In this paper we exhibit infinite families of embedded tori in 4-manifolds that are topologically isotopic but smoothly distinct. The interesting thing about these tori is that they are topologically trivial in the sense that each bounds a topologically embedded solid handlebody. This implies that there are stably ribbon surfaces in 4-manifolds that are not ribbon.
