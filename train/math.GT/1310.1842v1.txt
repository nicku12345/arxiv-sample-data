In this paper we clarify an issue in the knot surgery construction of Fintushel and Stern. Using knot surgery, they construct an infinite number of smooth structures on 4-manifolds satisfying certain conditions, but they do not explicitly work out the circumstances under which two manifolds that arise from their construction will fail to be diffeomorphic on the grounds of Seiberg-Witten theory. This paper fills in that gap.
