Let N_{g,s} denote the nonorientable surface of genus g with s boundary components. Recently Paris and Szepietowski obtained an explicit finite presentation for the mapping class group M(N_{g,s}) of the surface N_{g,s}, where s\in{0,1} and g+s>3. Following this work we obtain a finite presentation for the mapping class group M(N_{g,s}) with generators being Dehn twists and one crosscap slide.
