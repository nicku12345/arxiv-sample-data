Is any positive knot the closure of a positive braid? No. But if we consider positivity in terms of the generators of the braid group due to Birman, Ko and Lee, then the answer is yes. In this paper we prove that the same occurs when considering homogeneity.   In the way we prove that the plumbing of two surfaces is a BKL-homogeneous surface if and only if both summands are BKL-homogeneous surfaces, a parallel result to that of Rudolph involving quasipositive surfaces. BKL-homogeneous surfaces are, in fact, a natural generalization of quasipositive surfaces.
