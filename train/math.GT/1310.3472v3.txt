We give a complete classification of exceptional surgeries on hyperbolic alternating knots in the 3-sphere. As an appendix, we also show that the Montesinos knots M (-1/2, 2/5, 1/(2q + 1)) with q at least 5 have no non-trivial exceptional surgeries. This gives the final step in a complete classification of exceptional surgery on arborescent knots.
