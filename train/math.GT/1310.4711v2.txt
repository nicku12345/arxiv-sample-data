Let S_{g,p} denote the genus g orientable surface with p \ge 0 punctures, and let \omega(g,p)= 3g+p-4. We prove the existence of infinitely long geodesic rays \left\{v_{0},v_{1}, v_{2}, ...\right\} in the curve graph satisfying the following optimal intersection property: for any natural number k, the endpoints v_{i},v_{i+k} of any length k subsegment intersect O(\omega^{k-2}) times. By combining this with work of the first author, we answer a question of Dan Margalit.
