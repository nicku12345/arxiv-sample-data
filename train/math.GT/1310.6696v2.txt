We perform two explicit computations of bordered Heegaard Floer invariants. The first is the type D trimodule associated to the trivial S^1 bundle over the pair of pants P. The second is a bimodule that is necessary for self-gluing, when two torus boundary components of a bordered manifold are glued to each other. Using the results of these two computations, we describe an algorithm for computing HF-hat of any graph manifold.
