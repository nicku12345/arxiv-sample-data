Let P : \Sigma \rightarrow S be a finite degree covering map between surfaces. Rafi and Schleimer show that there is an induced quasi-isometric embedding \Pi : \mathcal{C}(S) \rightarrow \mathcal{C}(\Sigma) between the associated curve complexes. We define an operation on curves in \mathcal{C}(\Sigma) using minimal intersection number conditions and prove that it approximates a nearest point projection to \Pi(\mathcal{C}(S)). We also approximate hulls of finite sets of vertices in the curve complex, together with their corresponding nearest point projections, using intersection numbers.
