Let K_1, K_2 be two knots with t(K_1)+t(K_2)>2 and t(K_1 # K_2)=2. Then, in the present paper, we will show that any genus three Heegaard splittings of E(K_1 # K_2) is strongly irreducible and that E(K_1 # K_2) has at most four genus three Heegaard splittings up to homeomorphism. Moreover, we will give a complete classification of those four genus three Heegaard splittings and show unknotting tunnel systems of knots K_1 # K_2 corresponding to those Heegaard splittings.
