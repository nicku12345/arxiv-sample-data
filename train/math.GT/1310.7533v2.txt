Let \phi \in \mbox{Out}(F_n) be a free group outer automorphism that can be represented by an expanding, irreducible train-track map. The automorphism \phi determines a free-by-cyclic group \Gamma=F_n \rtimes_\phi \mathbb Z, and a homomorphism \alpha \in H^1(\Gamma; \mathbb Z). By work of Neumann, Bieri-Neumann-Strebel and Dowdall-Kapovich-Leininger, \alpha has an open cone neighborhood \mathcal A in H^1(\Gamma;\mathbb R) whose integral points correspond to other fibrations of \Gamma whose associated outer automorphisms are themselves representable by expanding irreducible train-track maps. In this paper, we define an analog of McMullen's Teichm\"uller polynomial that computes the dilatations of all outer automorphism in \mathcal A.
