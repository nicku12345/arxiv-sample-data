Let M be a closed, orientable hyperbolic 3-manifold and \phi a homomorphism of its fundamental group onto \mathbb{Z} that is not induced by a fibration over the circle. For each natural number n we give an explicit lower bound, linear in n, on rank of the fundamental group of the cover of M corresponding to \phi^{-1}(n\mathbb{Z}). The key new ingredient is the following result: for such a manifold M and a connected, two-sided incompressible surface of genus g in M that is not a fiber or semi-fiber, a reduced homotopy in (M,S) has length at most 14g-12.
