There are a number of homological knot invariants, each satisfying an unoriented skein exact sequence, which can be realized as the limit page of a spectral sequence starting at a version of the Khovanov chain complex. Compositions of elementary 1-handle movie moves induce a morphism of spectral sequences. These morphisms remain unexploited in the literature, perhaps because there is still an open question concerning the naturality of maps induced by general movies.   In this paper we focus on the spectral sequences due to Kronheimer-Mrowka from Khovanov homology to instanton knot Floer homology, and on that due to Ozsv\'ath-Szab\'o to the Heegaard-Floer homology of the branched double cover. For example, we use the 1-handle morphisms to give new information about the filtrations on the instanton knot Floer homology of the (4,5) torus knot, determining these up to an ambiguity in a pair of degrees; to determine the Ozsv\'ath-Szab\'o spectral sequence for an infinite class of prime knots; and to show that higher differentials of both the Kronheimer-Mrowka and the Ozsv\'ath-Szab\'o spectral sequences necessarily lower the delta grading for all pretzel knots.
