We investigate constraints on embeddings of a non-orientable surface in a 4-manifold with the homology of M \times I, where M is a rational homology 3-sphere. The constraints take the form of inequalities involving the genus and normal Euler class of the surface, and either the Ozsv\'ath--Sazb\'o d-invariants or Atiyah--Singer \rho-invariants of M. One consequence is that the minimal genus of a smoothly embedded surface in L(2p,q) \times I is the same as the minimal genus of a surface in L(2p,q). We also consider embeddings of non-orientable surfaces in closed 4-manifolds.
