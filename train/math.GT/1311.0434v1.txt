In this study, the concept of dual Lorentzian homotetic exponential motions in is discussed and their velocities, accelerations obtained. Also, some geometric results between velocity and acceleration vectors of a point in a spatial motion are obtained. Finally, the theorems related to acceleration and acceleration centres is given.
