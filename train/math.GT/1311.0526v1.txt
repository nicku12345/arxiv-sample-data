An n-crossing is a point in the projection of a knot where n strands cross so that each strand bisects the crossing. An \"ubercrossing projection has a single n-crossing and a petal projection has a single n-crossing such that there are no loops nested within others. The \"ubercrossing number, \text{\"u}(K), is the smallest n for which we can represent a knot K with a single n-crossing. The petal number is the number of loops in the minimal petal projection. In this paper, we relate the \"{u}bercrossing number and petal number to well-known invariants such as crossing number, bridge number, and unknotting number. We find that the bounds we have constructed are tight for (r, r+1)-torus knots. We also explore the behavior of \"{u}bercrossing number under composition.
