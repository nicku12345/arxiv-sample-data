Two link diagrams on compact surfaces are strongly equivalent if they are related by Reidemeister moves and orientation preserving homeomorphisms of the surfaces. They are stably equivalent if they are related by the two previous operations and adding or removing handles. Turaev and Turner constructed a link homology for each stable equivalence class by applying an unoriented topological quantum field theory (TQFT) to a geometric chain complex similar to Bar-Natan's one. In this paper, by using an unoriented homotopy quantum field theory (HQFT), we construct a link homology for each strong equivalence class. Moreover, our homology yields an invariant of links in the oriented I-bundle of a compact surface.
