Let D(K) be the positively-clasped untwisted Whitehead double of a knot K, and T_{p,q} be the (p,q) torus knot. We show that D(T_{2,2m+1}) and D^2(T_{2,2m+1}) are linearly independent in the smooth knot concordance group \mathcal{C} for each m\geq 2. Further, D(T_{2,5}) and D^2(T_{2,5}) generate a \mathbb{Z}\oplus\mathbb{Z} summand in the subgroup of \mathcal{C} generated by topologically slice knots. We use the concordance invariant \delta of Manolescu and Owens, using Heegaard Floer correction term. Interestingly, these results are not easily shown using other concordance invariants such as the \tau-invariant of knot Floer theory and the s-invariant of Khovanov homology. We also determine the infinity version of the knot Floer complex of D(T_{2,2m+1}) for any m\geq 1 generalizing a result for T_{2,3} of Hedden, Kim and Livingston.
