In this paper we describe braid equivalence for knots and links in a 3-manifold M obtained by rational surgery along a framed link in S^3. We first prove a sharpened version of the Reidemeister theorem for links in M. We then give geometric formulations of the braid equivalence via mixed braids in S^3 using the L-moves and the braid band moves.   We finally give algebraic formulations in terms of the mixed braid groups B_{m,n} using cabling and the techniques of parting and combing for mixed braids. We also provide concrete formuli of the braid equivalence in the case where M is a lens space, a Seifert manifold or a homology sphere obtained from the trefoil. The algebraic classification of knots and links in a 3-manifold via mixed braids is a useful tool for studying skein modules of 3-manifolds.
