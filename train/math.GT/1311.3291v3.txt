We provide an alternative proof of a sufficient condition for the fundamental group of the n^{th} cyclic branched cover of S^3 along a prime knot K to be left-orderable, which is originally due to Boyer-Gordon-Watson. As an application of this sufficient condition, we show that for any (p,q) two-bridge knot, with p\equiv 3 \text{ mod } 4, there are only finitely many cyclic branched covers whose fundamental groups are not left-orderable. This answers a question posed by D{\c a}bkowski, Przytycki and Togha.
