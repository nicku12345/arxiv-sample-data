Let M be a compact surface and P be either \mathbb{R} or S^1. For a smooth map f:M\to P and a closed subset V\subset M, denote by \mathcal{S}(f,V) the group of diffeomorphisms h of M preserving f, i.e. satisfying the relation f\circ h = f, and fixed on V. Let also \mathcal{S}'(f,V) be its subgroup consisting of diffeomorphisms isotopic relatively V to the identity map \mathrm{id}_{M} via isotopies that are not necessarily f-preserving. The groups \pi_0 \mathcal{S}(f,V) and \pi_0 \mathcal{S}'(f,V) can be regarded as analogues of mapping class group for f-preserving diffeomorphisms. The paper describes precise algebraic structure of groups \pi_0 \mathcal{S}'(f,V) and some of their subgroups and quotients for a large class of smooth maps f:M\to P containing all Morse maps, where M is orientable and distinct from 2-sphere and 2-torus. In particular, it is shown that for certain subsets V "adapted" in some sense with f, the groups \pi_0 \mathcal{S}'(f,V) are solvable and Bieberbach.
