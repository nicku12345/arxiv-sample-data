The flat plumbing basket presentation of a link is introduced by Furihata, Hirasawa and Kobayashi. In this paper, we show that the pass-equivalence and an equivalence introduced by using the flat plumbing basket presentation are the same relation. Furthermore, we obtain an evaluation of the minimal number of bands used for the flat pluming basket presentation for a knot coming from the degree of the Alexander polynomial and the three genus of the knot.
