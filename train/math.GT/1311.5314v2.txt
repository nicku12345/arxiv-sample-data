Following the analogies between 3-dimensional topology and number theory, we study an id\`elic form of class field theory for 3-manifolds. For a certain set \mathcal{K} of knots in a 3-manifold M, we first present a local theory for each knot in \mathcal{K}, which is analogous to local class field theory, and then, getteing together over all knots in \mathcal{K}, we give an analogue of id\`elic global class field theory for an integral homology sphere M.
