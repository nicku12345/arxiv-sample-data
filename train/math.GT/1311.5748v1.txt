It is well-known that the monoid of long virtual knots is not commutative. This contrasts with the case of classical long knots, where A \# B \leftrightharpoons B \# A for all A,B. In the present paper, we present a new proof that two inequivalent non-classical prime long virtual knots never commute. The original result is due to Manturov. The techniques used here are mostly geometric. First, a slightly strengthened version of Kuperberg's theorem is established. We then show that a well-defined concatenation of two long knots in a thickened surface is preserved by stabilization when both long knots are non-classical. Finally, it is proved that if A,B,C,D are prime non-classical long virtual knots such that A \# B is non-classical and A \# B \leftrightharpoons C \# D, then A \leftrightharpoons C and B \leftrightharpoons D.
