Aramayona and Leininger have provided a "finite rigid subset" \mathfrak{X}(\Sigma) of the curve complex \mathscr{C}(\Sigma) of a surface \Sigma = \Sigma^n_g, characterized by the fact that any simplicial injection \mathfrak{X}(\Sigma) \to \mathscr{C}(\Sigma) is induced by a unique element of the mapping class group \mathrm{Mod}(\Sigma). In this paper we prove that, in the case of the sphere with n\geq 5 marked points, the reduced homology class of the finite rigid set of Aramayona and Leininger is a \mathrm{Mod}(\Sigma)-module generator for the reduced homology of the curve complex \mathscr{C}(\Sigma), answering in the affirmative a question posed by Aramayona and Leininger. For the surface \Sigma = \Sigma_g^n with g\geq 3 and n\in \{0,1\} we find that the finite rigid set \mathfrak{X}(\Sigma) of Aramayona and Leininger contains a proper subcomplex X(\Sigma) whose reduced homology class is a \mathrm{Mod}(\Sigma)-module generator for the reduced homology of \mathscr{C}(\Sigma) but which is not itself rigid.
