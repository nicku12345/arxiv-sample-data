Given a real analytic function f from \mathbb{R}^4 to \mathbb{R}^2 with isolated critical point at the origin, the link L_f of the singularity is a real fibred knot in \mathbb{S}^{3}. From this singularities, we construct a family of real isolated suspension singularities from \mathbb{R}^6 to \mathbb{R}^2 such that its links are the total spaces of the n-branched cyclic coverings over the corresponding knots. In this way we obtain as links of singularities, 3-manifolds that does not appear in the complex case, such as hyperbolic 3-manifolds or the Hantzsche-Wendt manifold.
