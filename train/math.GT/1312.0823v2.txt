For an oriented irreducible 3-manifold M with non-empty toroidal boundary, we describe how sutured Floer homology (SFH) can be used to determine all fibered classes in H^1(M). Furthermore, we show that the SFH of a balanced sutured manifold (M,\gamma) detects which classes in H^1(M) admit a taut depth one foliation such that the only compact leaves are the components of R(\gamma). The latter had been proved earlier by the first author under the extra assumption that H_2(M)=0. The main technical result is that we can obtain an extremal \text{Spin}^c-structure \mathfrak{s} (i.e., one that is in a `corner' of the support of SFH) via a nice and taut sutured manifold decomposition even when H_2(M) \neq 0, assuming the corresponding group SFH(M,\gamma,\mathfrak{s}) has non-trivial Euler characteristic.
