In this paper a study of G-minimality, i.e., minimality of four-manifolds equipped with an action of a finite group G, is initiated. We focus on cyclic actions on CP^2\# \overline{CP^2}, and our work shows that even in this simple setting, the comparison of G-minimality in the various categories, i.e., locally linear, smooth, and symplectic, is already delicate and interesting. For example, we show that if a symplectic Z_n-action on CP^2\# \overline{CP^2} has an invariant locally linear topological (-1)-sphere, then it must admit an invariant symplectic (-1)-sphere, provided that n=2 or n is odd. For the case where n>2 and even, the same conclusion holds under a stronger assumption, i.e., the invariant (-1)-sphere is smoothly embedded. Along the way of these proofs we develop certain techniques for producing embedded invariant J-holomorphic two-spheres of self-intersection -r under a weaker assumption of an invariant smooth (-r)-sphere for r relatively small compared with the group order n. We then apply the techniques to give a classification of G-Hirzebruch surfaces (i.e., Hirzebruch surfaces equipped with a homologically trivial, holomorphic G=Z_n-action) up to orientation-preserving equivariant diffeomorphisms. The main issue of the classification is to distinguish non-diffeomorphic G-Hirzebruch surfaces which have the same fixed-point set structure. An interesting discovery is that these non-diffeomorphic G-Hirzebruch surfaces have distinct equivariant Gromov-Taubes invariant, giving the first examples of such kind. Going back to the original question of G-minimality, we show that for G=Z_n, a minimal rational G-surface is minimal as a symplectic G-manifold if and only if it is minimal as a smooth G-manifold.
