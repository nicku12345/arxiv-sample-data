Let G be a u.s.c decomposition of S^n, H_G denote the set of nondegenerate elements and \pi be the projection of S^n onto S^n/G. Suppose that each point in the decomposition space has arbitrarily small neighborhoods with (n-1)-sphere frontiers which miss \pi(H_G), and such frontiers satisfies the Mismatch Property. Then this paper shows that this condition implies S^n/G is homeomorphic to S^n (n\geq 4). This answers a weakened form of a conjecture asked by Daverman [3, p. 61]. In the case n=3, the strong form of the conjecture has an affirmative answer from Woodruff [12].
