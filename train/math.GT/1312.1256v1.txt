An important geometric invariant of links in lens spaces is the lift in the 3-sphere of a link L in L(p,q), that is the counterimage \widetilde L of L under the universal covering of L(p,q). If lens spaces are defined as a lens with suitable boundary identifications, then a link in L(p,q) can be represented by a disk diagram, that is to say, a regular projection of the link on a disk. Starting from a disk diagram of L, we obtain a diagram of the lift \widetilde L in the 3-sphere. With this construction we are able to find different knots and links in L(p,q) having equivalent lifts, that is to say, we cannot distinguish different links in lens spaces only from their lift.
