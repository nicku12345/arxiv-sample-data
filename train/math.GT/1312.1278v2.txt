We prove that if an alternating knot has unknotting number one, then there exists an unknotting crossing in any alternating diagram. This is done by showing that the obstruction to unknotting number one developed by Greene in his work on alternating 3-braid knots is sufficient to identify all unknotting number one alternating knots. As a consequence, we also get a converse to the Montesinos trick: an alternating knot has unknotting number one if its branched double cover arises as half-integer surgery on a knot in S^3. We also reprove a characterisation of almost-alternating diagrams of the unknot originally due to Tsukamoto.
