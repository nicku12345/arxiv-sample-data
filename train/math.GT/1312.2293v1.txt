Bounded-type 3-manifolds arise as combinatorially bounded gluings of irreducible 3-manifolds chosen from a finite list. We prove effective hyperbolization and effective rigidity for a broad class of 3-manifolds of bounded type and large gluing heights. Specifically, we show the existence and uniqueness of hyperbolic metrics on 3-manifolds of bounded type and large heights, and prove existence of a bilipschitz diffeomorphism to a combinatorial model described explicitly in terms of the list of irreducible manifolds, the topology of the identification, and the combinatorics of the gluing maps.
