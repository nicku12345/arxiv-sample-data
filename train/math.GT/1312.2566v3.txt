These introductory lectures show how to define finite type invariants of links and 3-manifolds by counting graph configurations in 3-manifolds, following ideas of Witten and Kontsevich. The linking number is the simplest finite type invariant for 2-component links. It is defined in many equivalent ways in the first section. As an important example, we present it as the algebraic intersection of a torus and a 4-chain called a propagator in a configuration space. In the second section, we introduce the simplest finite type 3-manifold invariant, which is the Casson invariant (or the Theta-invariant) of integer homology 3-spheres. It is defined as the algebraic intersection of three propagators in the same two-point configuration space. In the third section, we explain the general notion of finite type invariants and introduce relevant spaces of Feynman Jacobi diagrams. In Sections 4 and 5, we sketch an original construction based on configuration space integrals of universal finite type invariants for links in rational homology 3-spheres and we state open problems. Our construction generalizes the known constructions for links in the ambient space, and it makes them more flexible. In Section 6, we present the needed properties of parallelizations of 3-manifolds and associated Pontrjagin classes, in details.
