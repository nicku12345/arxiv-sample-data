We prove that in any hyperbolic orbifold with one boundary component, the product of any hyperbolic fundamental group element with a sufficiently large multiple of the boundary is represented by a geodesic loop that virtually bounds an immersed surface. In the case that the orbifold is a disk, there are some conditions. Our results generalize work of Calegari-Louwsma and resolve a conjecture of Calegari.
