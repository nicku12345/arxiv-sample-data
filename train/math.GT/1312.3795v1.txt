We consider in this work representations of the of the fundamental group of the 3-punctured sphere in {\rm PU}(2,1) such that the boundary loops are mapped to {\rm PU}(2,1). We provide a system of coordinates on the corresponding representation variety, and analyse more specifically those representations corresponding to subgroups of (3,3,\infty)-groups. In particular we prove that it is possible to construct representations of the free group of rank two \la a,b\ra in {\rm PU}(2,1) for which a, b, ab, ab^{-1}, ab^2, a^2b and [a,b] all are mapped to parabolics.
