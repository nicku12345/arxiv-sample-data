Lomonaco and Kauffman introduced knot mosaic system to give a definition of quantum knot system. This definition is intended to represent an actual physical quantum system. A knot (m,n)-mosaic is an m \times n matrix of mosaic tiles which are T_0 through T_{10} depicted as below, representing a knot or a link by adjoining properly that is called suitably connected. An interesting question in studying mosaic theory is how many knot (m,n)-mosaics are there. D_{m,n} denotes the total number of all knot (m,n)-mosaics. This counting is very important because the total number of knot mosaics is indeed the dimension of the Hilbert space of these quantum knot mosaics.   In this paper, we find a table of the precise values of D_{m,n} for 4 \leq m \leq n \leq 6 as below. Mainly we use a partition matrix argument which turns out to be remarkably efficient to count small knot mosaics.   \begin{center} \begin{tabular}{|c|r|r|r|} \hline D_{m,n} & n=4 & n=5 & n=6 \\ \hline m=4 & 2594 & 54,226 & 1,144,526 \\ \hline m=5 & & 4,183,954 & 331,745,962 \\ \hline m=6 & & & 101,393,411,126 \\ \hline \end{tabular} \end{center}
