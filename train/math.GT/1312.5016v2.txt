We prove that in the complement of a highly twisted link, all closed, essential, meridionally incompressible surfaces must have high genus. The genus bound is proportional to the number of crossings per twist region. A similar result holds for surfaces with meridional boundary: such a surface either has large negative Euler characteristic, or is an n-punctured sphere visible in the diagram.
