We calculate the bridge distance for m-bridge knots/links in the 3-sphere with sufficiently complicated 2m-plat projections. In particular we show that if the underlying braid of the plat has n - 1 rows of twists and all its exponents have absolute value greater than or equal to three then the distance of the bridge sphere is exactly \lceil n/(2(m - 2)) \rceil, where \lceil x \rceil is the smallest integer greater than or equal to x. As a corollary, we conclude that if such a diagram has more than 4m(m-2) rows then the bridge sphere defining the plat projection is the unique minimal bridge sphere for the knot.
