Let X_0 denote a compact, simply-connected smooth 4-manifold with boundary the Poincar\'e homology 3-sphere \Sigma(2,3,5) and with even negative definite intersection form Q_{X_0}=E_8. We show that free \mathbb{Z}/p actions on \Sigma(2,3,5) do not extend to smooth actions on X_0 with isolated fixed points for any prime p>7. The approach is to study the equivariant version of the Yang-Mills instanton-one moduli space for 4-manifolds with cylindrical ends. As an application we show that for p>7 a smooth \mathbb{Z}/p action on \#^8 S^2 \times S^2 with isolated fixed points does not split along a free action on \Sigma(2,3,5). The results hold for p=7 if the action is homologically trivial.
