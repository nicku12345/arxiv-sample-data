Dye and Kauffman defined surface bracket polynomials for virtual links by use of surface states, and found a relationship between the surface states and the minimal genus of a surface in which a virtual link diagram is realized. They and Miyazawa independently defined a multivariable polynomial invariant of virtual links. This invariant is deeply related to the surface states. In this paper, we introduce the notion of surface pole bracket polynomials for link diagrams in closed surfaces, as a generalization of surface bracket polynomials by Dye and Kauffman. The polynomials induce the invariant of twisted links defined by the author before as a generalization of Dye, Kauffman and Miyazawa's polynomial invariant. Furthermore we discuss a relationship between curves in surface pole states and variables of the polynomial invariant.
