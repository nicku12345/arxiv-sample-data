Bordered Heegaard Floer homology is an invariant for 3-manifolds, which associates to a surface F an algebra A(F), and to a 3-manifold Y with boundary, together with an orientation-preserving diffeomorphism from F to the boundary of Y, a module over A(F). In a previous paper, we defined relative Z/2 differential gradings on the algebra A(F) and the modules over it. In this paper, we turn the relative grading into an absolute one, and show that the resulting Z/2-graded module is an invariant of the bordered 3-manifold.
