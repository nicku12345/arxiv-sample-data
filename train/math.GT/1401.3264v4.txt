Using Seiberg-Witten Floer spectrum and Pin(2)-equivariant KO-theory, we prove new Furuta-type inequalities on the intersection forms of spin cobordisms between homology 3-spheres. As an application, we give explicit constrains on the intersection forms of spin 4-manifolds bounded by Brieskorn spheres \pm\Sigma(2,3,6k\pm1). Along the way, we also give an alternative proof of Furuta-Kametanni's improvement of 10/8-theorem for closed spin-4 manifolds.
