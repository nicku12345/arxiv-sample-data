In two previous papers, the author showed how to decompose the Khovanov homology of a link \mathcal{L} into the algebraic pairing of a type D structure and a type A structure (as defined in bordered Floer homology), whenever a diagram for \mathcal{L} is decomposed into the union of two tangles. Since Khovanov homology is the categorification of a version of the Jones polynomial, it is natural to ask what the type A and type D structures categorify, and how their pairing is encoded in the decategorifications. In this paper, the author constructs the decategorifications of these two structures, in a manner similar to Ina Petkova's decategorification of bordered Floer homology and shows how they recover the Jones polynomial. We also give a new proof of the mutation invariance of the Jones polynomial which uses these decomposition techniques.
