The Ptolemy coordinates for boundary-unipotent SL(n,C)-representations of a 3-manifold group were introduced in Garoufalidis-Thurston-Zickert inspired by the A-coordinates on higher Teichm\"{u}ller space due to Fock and Goncharov. In this paper, we define the Ptolemy field of a (generic) PSL(2,\C)-representation and prove that it coincides with the trace field of the representation. This gives an efficient algorithm to compute the trace field of a cusped hyperbolic manifold.
