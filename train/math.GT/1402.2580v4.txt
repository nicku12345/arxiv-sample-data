We construct here two new examples of non-orientable, non-compact, hyperbolic 4-manifolds. The first has minimal volume v_m = 4{\pi}^2/3 and two cusps. This example has the lowest number of cusps among known minimal volume hyperbolic 4-manifolds. The second has volume 2\cdot v_m and one cusp. It has lowest volume among known one-cusped hyperbolic 4-manifolds.
