It is known that every {\rm C}^r-orbifold, 1\leq r\leq\infty, has a compatible {\rm C}^s-differential structure, for every s, where r< s\leq\omega. We prove that if two reduced {\rm C}^r-orbifolds, 2\leq r\leq\omega, are {\rm C}^2-diffeomorphic, then they are {\rm C}^r-diffeomorphic. It follows that the compatible {\rm C}^s-differential structure on a reduced {\rm C}^r-orbifold, 2\leq r<s\leq\omega, is unique up to a {\rm C}^s-diffeomorphism.
