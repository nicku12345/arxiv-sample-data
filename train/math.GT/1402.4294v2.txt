Let K be a knot in S^3 and X its complement. We study deformations of non-abelian, metabelian, reducible representations of the knot group \pi\_1(X) into \mathrm{SL}(n,\mathbf{C}) which are associated to a simple root of the Alexander polynomial. We prove that certain of these metabelian reducible representations are smooth points of the \mathrm{SL}(n,\mathbf{C})-representation variety and that they have irreducible deformations.
