We give an O(p^{2}) time algorithm to compute the generalized Heegaard Floer complexes A_{s_{1},s_{2}}^{-}(\overrightarrow{L})'s for a two-bridge link \overrightarrow{L}=b(p,q) by using nice diagrams. Using the link surgery formula of Manolescu-Ozsv\'{a}th, we also show that {\bf HF}^{-} and their d-invariants of all integer surgeries on two-bridge links are determined by A_{s_{1},s_{2}}^{-}(\overrightarrow{L})'s. We obtain a polynomial time algorithm to compute {\bf HF}^{-} of all the surgeries on two-bridge links, with \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z} coefficients. In addition, we calculate some examples explicitly:   {\bf HF}^{-} and the d-invariants of all integer surgeries on a family of hyperbolic two-bridge links including the Whitehead link.
