We prove a transversality ``lifting property'' for compactified configuration spaces as an application of the multijet transversality theorem: the submanifold of configurations of points on an arbitrary submanifold of Euclidean space may be made transverse to any submanifold of the configuration space of points in Euclidean space by an arbitrarily C^1-small variation of the initial submanifold, as long as the two submanifolds of compactified configuration space are boundary-disjoint. We use this setup to provide attractive proofs of the existence of a number of ``special inscribed configurations'' inside families of spheres embedded in \mathbb{R}^n using differential topology. For instance, there is a C^1-dense family of smooth embedded circles in the plane where each simple closed curve has an odd number of inscribed squares, and there is a C^1-dense family of smooth embedded (n-1)-spheres in \mathbb{R}^n where each sphere has a family of inscribed regular n-simplices with the homology of O(n).
