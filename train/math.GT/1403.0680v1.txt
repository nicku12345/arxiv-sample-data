By a work of Thurston, it is known that if a hyperbolic fibred 3-manifold M has Betti number greater than 1, then M admits infinitely many distinct fibrations. For any fibration \omega on a hyperbolic 3-manifold M, the number of fibrations on M that are commensurable in the sense of Calegari-Sun-Wang to \omega is known to be finite. In this paper, we prove that the number can be arbitrarily large.
