We introduce a new class of links for which we give a lower bound for the slice genus g_*, using the generalized Rasmussen invariant. We show that this bound, in some cases, allows one to compute g_* exactly; in particular, we compute g_* for torus links. We also study another link invariant: the strong slice genus g_*^*. Studying the behaviour of a specific type of cobordisms in Lee homology, a lower bound for g_*^* is also given.
