For any knot K which bounds non-orientable and null-homologous surfaces F in punctured n\mathbb{C}P^2, we construct a lower bound of the first Betti number of F which consists of the signature of K and the Heegaard Floer d-invariant of the integer homology sphere obtained by 1-surgery along K. By using this lower bound, we prove that for any integer k, a certain knot cannot bound any surface which satisfies the above conditions and whose first Betti number is less than k.
