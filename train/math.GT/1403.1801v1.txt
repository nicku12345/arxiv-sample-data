The Hirzebruch signature formula provides an obstruction to the following realization question: given a rational Poincar\'e duality algebra \mathcal{A}, does there exist a smooth manifold M such that H^*(M;\mathbb{Q})=\mathcal{A}?   This problem is especially interesting for rational truncated polynomial algebras whose corresponding integral algebra is not realizable. For example, there are number theoretic constraints on the dimension n in which there exists a closed smooth manifold M^n with H^*(M^n;\mathbb{Q})= \mathbb{Q}[x]/\langle x^3\rangle. We limit the possible existence dimension to n=8(2^a+2^b). For n = 32, such manifolds are not two-connected. We show that the next smallest possible existence dimension is n=128. As there exists no integral \mathbb{O}P^m for m>2, the realization of the truncated polynomial algebra \mathbb{Q}[x]/\langle x^{m+1}\rangle, |x|=8 is studied. Similar considerations provide examples of topological manifolds which do not have the rational homotopy type of a smooth closed manifold.   The appendix presents a recursive algorithm for efficiently computing the coefficients of the L-polynomials which arise in the signature formula.
