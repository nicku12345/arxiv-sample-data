We study the problem of finding generators for the fundamental group G of a space of the following sort: one removes a family of complex hyperplanes from n dimensional complex vector space, or n dimensional complex hyperbolic space, or the Hermitian symmetric space for O(2,n), and then takes the quotient by a discrete group P{\Gamma}. The classical example is the braid group, but there are many similar "braid-like" groups that arise in topology and algebraic geometry. Our main result is that if P{\Gamma} contains reflections in the hyperplanes nearest the basepoint, and these reflections satisfy a certain property, then G is generated by the analogues of the generators of the classical braid group. We apply this to obtain generators for G in a particular intricate example in complex hyperbolic space of dimension 13. The interest in this example comes from a conjectured relationship between this braid-like group and the monster simple group M, that gives geometric meaning to the generators and relations in the Conway-Simons presentation of (M \times M):2.
