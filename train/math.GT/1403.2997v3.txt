For a fixed marked surface S, we show that the problem of deciding whether or not a mapping class is reducible lies in \textbf{NP}. As usual this immediately gives an exponential time algorithm to decide whether or not a mapping class is reducible.   To do this we use an (ideal) triangulation to obtain a coordinate system on the set of multicurves on S. The result then follows from the fact that the action of the mapping class group of S is piecewise-linear with respect to such a coordinate system and so we are able so show that: if a mapping class h fixes a multicurve then it fixes one whose size is at most exponential in the word length of h.   We go on to show how to repeat this construction on invariant subsurfaces. This allows us to show that a similar bound holds for the size of the canonical curve system of a mapping class and so give an alternate, elementary proof of a result of Koberda and Mangahas.
