For an oriented surface link S, we can take a satellite construction called a 2-dimensional braid over S, which is a surface link in the form of a covering over S. We demonstrate that 2-dimensional braids over surface links are useful for showing the distinctness of surface links. We investigate non-trivial examples of surface links with free abelian group of rank two, concluding that their link types are infinitely many.
