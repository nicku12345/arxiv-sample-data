Given a group endowed with a Z/2-valued morphism we associate a Gauss diagram theory, and show that for a particular choice of the group these diagrams encode faithfully virtual knots on a given arbitrary surface. This theory contains all of the earlier attempts to decorate Gauss diagrams, in a way that is made precise via symmetry-preserving maps. These maps become crucial when one makes use of decorated Gauss diagrams to describe finite-type invariants. In particular they allow us to generalize Grishanov-Vassiliev's formulas and to show that they define invariants of virtual knots.
