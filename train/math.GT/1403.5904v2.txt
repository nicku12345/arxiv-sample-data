We consider double plumbings of two disk bundles over spheres. We calculate the Heegaard-Floer homology with its absolute grading of the boundary of such a plumbing. Given a closed smooth 4-manifold X and a suitable pair of classes in H_{2}(X), we investigate when this pair of classes may be represented by a configuration of surfaces in X whose regular neighbourhood is a double plumbing of disk bundles over spheres. Using similar methods we study single plumbings of two disk bundles over spheres inside X.
