We give a combinatorial proof of the quasi-invertibility of \widehat{CFDD}(\mathbb{I}_\mathcal{Z}) in bordered Heegaard Floer homology, which implies a Koszul self-duality on the dg-algebra \mathcal{A}(\mathcal{Z}), for each pointed matched circle \mathcal{Z}. This is done by giving an explicit description of a rank 1 model for \widehat{CFAA}(\mathbb{I}_\mathcal{Z}), the quasi-inverse of \widehat{CFDD}(\mathbb{I}_\mathcal{Z}). This description is obtained by applying homological perturbation theory to a larger, previously known model of \widehat{CFAA}(\mathbb{I}_\mathcal{Z}).
