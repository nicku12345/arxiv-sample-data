Let \Sigma_g \to E \to \Sigma_h be a surface bundle over a surface with monodromy representation \rho: \pi_1 \Sigma_h \to \operatorname{Mod}(\Sigma_g) contained in the Torelli group \mathcal{I}_g. In this paper we express the cup product structure in H^*(E, \mathbb{Z}) in terms of the Johnson homomorphism \tau: \mathcal{I}_g \to \wedge^3 (H_1 (\Sigma_g, \mathbb{Z})). This is applied to the question of obtaining an upper bound on the maximal n such that p_1: E \to \Sigma_{h_1}, ..., p_n: E \to \Sigma_{h_n} are fibering maps realizing E as the total space of a surface bundle over a surface in n distinct ways. We prove that any nontrivial surface bundle over a surface with monodromy contained in the Johnson kernel \mathcal{K}_g fibers in a unique way.
