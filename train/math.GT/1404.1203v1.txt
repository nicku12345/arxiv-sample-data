We prove the equivalence of the invariants EH(L) and LOSS-(L) for oriented Legendrian knots L in the 3-sphere equipped with the standard contact structure, partially extending a previous result by Stipsicz and Vertesi. In the course of the proof we relate the sutured Floer homology groups associated with a knot complement and knot Floer homology, and define intermediate Legendrian invariants.
