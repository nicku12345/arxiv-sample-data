A filling Dehn sphere \Sigma in a closed 3-manifold M is a sphere transversely immersed in M that defines a cell decomposition of M. Every closed 3-manifold has a filling Dehn sphere. The Montesinos complexity of a 3-manifold M is defined as the minimal number of triple points among all the filling Dehn spheres of M. A sharp upper bound for the Montesinos complexity of the connected sum of two 3-manifolds is given.
