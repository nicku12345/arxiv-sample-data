It is well known that plane curves with the same endpoints are homotopic. An analogous claim for plane curves with the same endpoints and bounded curvature still remains open. In this work we find necessary and sufficient conditions for two plane curves with bounded curvature to be deformed, one to another, by a continuous one-parameter family of curves also having bounded curvature. We conclude that the space of these curves has either one or two connected components, depending on the distance between the endpoints. The classification theorem here presented answers a question raised in 1961 by L. E. Dubins.
