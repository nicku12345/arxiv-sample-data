We give an irreducible decomposition of the so-called local representations (see arXiv:0707.2151) of the quantum Teichm\"uller space \mathcal{T}_q(\Sigma) where \Sigma is a punctured surface of genus g>0 and q is a primitive N-th root of unity with N odd. As an application, we construct a family of representations of the Kauffman bracket skein algebra of the closed surface \overline\Sigma.
