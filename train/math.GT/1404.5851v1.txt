In view of the self-linking invariant, the number |K| of framed knots in S^3 with given underlying knot K is infinite. In fact, the second author previously defined affine self-linking invariants and used them to show that |K| is infinite for every knot in an orientable manifold unless the manifold contains a connected sum factor of S^1\times S^2; the knot K need not be zero-homologous and the manifold is not required to be compact.   We show that when M is orientable, the number |K| is infinite unless K intersects a non-separating sphere at exactly one point, in which case |K|=2; the existence of a non-separating sphere implies that M contains a connected sum factor of S^1\times S^2.   For knots in nonorientable manifolds we show that if |K| is finite, then K is disorienting, or there is an isotopy from the knot to itself which changes the orientation of its normal bundle, or it intersects some embedded S^2 or \mathbb R P^2 at exactly one point, or it intersects some embedded S^2 at exactly two points in such a way that a closed curve consisting of an arc in K between the intersection points and an arc in S^2 is disorienting.
