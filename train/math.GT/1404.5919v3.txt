We extend the Eliashberg-Thurston theorem on approximations of taut oriented C^2-foliations of 3-manifolds by both positive and negative contact structures to a large class of taut oriented C^{1,0}-foliations, where by C^{1,0} foliation, we mean a foliation with continuous tangent plane field. These C^{1,0}-foliations can therefore be approximated by weakly symplectically fillable, universally tight, contact structures. This allows applications of C^2-foliation theory to contact topology and Floer theory to be generalized and extended to constructions of C^{1,0}-foliations.
