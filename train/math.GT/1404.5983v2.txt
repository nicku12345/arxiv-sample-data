Eisermann has shown that the Jones polynomial of a n-component ribbon link L\subset S^3 is divided by the Jones polynomial of the trivial n-component link. We improve this theorem by extending its range of application from links in S^3 to colored knotted trivalent graphs in \#_g(S^2\times S^1), the connected sum of g\geqslant 0 copies of S^2\times S^1.   We show in particular that if the Kauffman bracket of a knot in \#_g(S^2\times S^1) has a pole in q=i of order n, the ribbon genus of the knot is at least \frac {n+1}2. We construct some families of knots in \#_g(S^2\times S^1) for which this lower bound is sharp and arbitrarily big. We prove these estimates using Turaev shadows.
