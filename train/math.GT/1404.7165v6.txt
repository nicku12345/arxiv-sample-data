In this paper, we define the rectangle condition on the bridge sphere for a n-bridge decomposition of a knot whose definition is analogous to the definition of the rectangle condition for Heegaard splittings of 3-manifolds. We show that the satisfaction of the rectangle condition for a n-bridge decomposition can guarantee that the Hempel distance for the n-bridge decomposition is greater than or equal to 2. In particular, we give an interesting family of alternating 3-bridge knots by using the rectangle condition and a modified train track argument.
