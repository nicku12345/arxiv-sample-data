All knots in R^3 possess Seifert surfaces, and so the classical Thurston-Bennequin and rotation (or Maslov) invariants for Legendrian knots in a contact structure on R^3 can be defined. The definitions extend easily to null-homologous knots in any 3-manifold M endowed with a contact structure \xi. We generalize the definition of Seifert surfaces and use them to define these invariants for all Legendrian knots, including those that are not null-homologous, in a contact structure on the 3-torus T^3. We show how to compute the Thurston-Bennequin and rotation invariants in a tight oriented contact structure on T^3 using projections.
