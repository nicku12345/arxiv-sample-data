We introduce a Lie algebra associated with a non-orientable surface, which is an analogue for the Goldman Lie algebra of an oriented surface. As an application, we deduce an explicit formula of the Dehn twist along an annulus simple closed curve on the surface as in Kawazumi-Kuno and Masseyeau-Turaev.
