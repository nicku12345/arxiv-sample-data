In 1983, Banchoff and Kuhnel constructed a minimal triangulation of \CP^2 with 9 vertices. \CP^3 was first triangulated by Bagchi and Datta in 2012 with 18 vertices. Known lower bound on number of vertices of a triangulation of \CP^n is 1 + \frac{(n + 1)^2}{2} for n \geq 3. We give explicit construction of some triangulations of complex projective space \CP^n with \frac{4^{n+1}-1}{3} vertices for all n. No explicit triangulation of \CP^n is known for n \geq 4.
