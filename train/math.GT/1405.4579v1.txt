The Reeb graph \mathcal{R}(f)  is one of the fundamental invariants of a smooth function f\colon M\to \mathbb{R}  with isolated critical points. It is defined as the quotient space M/_{\!\sim} of the closed manifold M by a relation that depends on f. Here we construct a 1-dimensional complex \Gamma(f) embedded into M which is homotopy equivalent to \mathcal{R}(f). As a consequence we show that for every function f on a manifold with finite fundamental group, the Reeb graph of f is a tree. If \pi_1(M) is an abelian group, or more general, a discrete amenable group, then \mathcal{R}(f) contains at most one loop. Finally we prove that the number of loops in the Reeb graph of every function on a surface M_g is estimated from above by g, the genus of M_g.
