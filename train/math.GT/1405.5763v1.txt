We show that, associated with any complex root of unity \omega, there exists a particularly simple 4d-TQFT model M_\omega defined on the cobordism category of Delta complexes. For an oriented closed 4-manifold X of Euler characteristic \chi(X), it is conjectured that the quantity N^{3\chi(X)/2}M_\omega(X), where N is the order of \omega, takes only finitely many values as a function of \omega. In particular, it is equal to 1 for S^4, \left(3+(-1)^{N}\right)/2 for S^2\times S^2, and N^{-1/2}\sum_{k=1}^N\omega^{k^2} for \mathbb{C} P^2.
