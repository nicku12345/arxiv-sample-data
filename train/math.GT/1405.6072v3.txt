We use virtual knot theory to detect the non-invertibility of some classical links in \mathbb{S}^3. These links appear in the study of virtual covers. Briefly, a virtual cover associates a virtual knot \upsilon to a knot K in a 3-manifold N, under certain hypotheses on K and N. Virtual covers of links in \mathbb{S}^3 come from taking K to be in the complement N of a fibered link J. If J \sqcup K is invertible and K is "close to" a fiber of J, then \upsilon satisfies a symmetry condition to which some virtual knot polynomials are sensitive. We also discuss virtual covers of links J \sqcup K where J is not fibered but is virtually fibered (in the sense of W. Thurston).
