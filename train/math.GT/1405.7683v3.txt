Knot mosaics are used to model physical quantum states. The mosaic number of a knot is the smallest integer m such that the knot can be represented as a knot m-mosaic. In this paper we establish an upper bound for the crossing number of a knot in terms of the mosaic number. Given an m-mosaic and any knot K that is represented on the mosaic, its crossing number c is bounded above by (m - 2)^{2} - 2 if m is odd, and (m - 2)^{2} - (m - 3) if m is even.
