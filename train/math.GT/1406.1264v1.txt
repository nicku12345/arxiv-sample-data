For a boundary-reducible 3-manifold M with \partial M a genus g surface, we show that if M admits a genus g+1 Heegaard surface S, then the disk complex of S is simply connected. Also we consider the connectedness of the complex of reducing spheres. We investigate the intersection of two reducing spheres for a genus three Heegaard splitting of \mathrm{(torus)} \times I.
