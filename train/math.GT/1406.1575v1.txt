It is known that for coprime integers p>q\geq 1, the lens space L(p^2,pq-1) bounds a rational ball, B_{p,q}, arising as the 2-fold branched cover of a (smooth) slice disk in B^4 bounding the associated 2-bridge knot. Lekilli and Maydanskiy give handle decompositions for each B_{p,q}. Whereas, Yamada gives an alternative definition of rational balls, A_{m,n}, bounding L(p^2,pq-1) by their handlebody decompositions alone. We show that these two families coincide - answering a question of Kadokami and Yamada. To that end, we show that each A_{m,n} admits a Stein filling of the "standard" contact structure, \bar{\xi}_{st}, on L(p^2,pq-1) investigated by Lisca.
