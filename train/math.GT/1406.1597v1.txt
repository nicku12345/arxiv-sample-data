Let P(K) be a satellite knot where the pattern, P, is a Berge-Gabai knot (i.e., a knot in the solid torus with a non-trivial solid torus Dehn surgery), and the companion, K, is a non-trivial knot in S^3. We prove that P(K) is an L-space knot if and only if K is an L-space knot and P is sufficiently positively twisted relative to the genus of K. This generalizes the result for cables due to Hedden and the first author.
