We use topology of configuration spaces to give a characterization of Neuwirth--Stallings pairs (S^5, K) with \dim K = 2. As a consequence, we construct polynomial map germs (\mathbb{R}^{6},0)\to (\mathbb{R}^{3},0) with an isolated singularity at the origin such that their Milnor fibers are not diffeomorphic to a disk, thus putting an end to Milnor's non-triviality question. Furthermore, for a polynomial map germ (\mathbb{R}^{2n},0) \to (\mathbb{R}^{n},0) or (\mathbb{R}^{2n+1},0) \to (\mathbb{R}^{n},0), n \geq 3, with an isolated singularity at the origin, we study the conditions under which the associated Milnor fiber has the homotopy type of a bouquet of spheres. We then construct, for every pair (n, p) with n/2 \geq p \geq 2, a new example of a polynomial map germ (\mathbb{R}^n,0) \to (\mathbb{R}^p,0) with an isolated singularity at the origin such that its Milnor fiber has the homotopy type of a bouquet of a positive number of spheres.
