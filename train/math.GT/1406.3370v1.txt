We prove the perhaps surprising result that given any three polygonal unknots in \R^3, then we may form the Borromean rings out of them through rigid motions of \R^3 applied to the individual components together with possible scaling of the components. We also prove that if at least two of the unknots are planar, then we do not need scaling. This is true even for a set of three polygonal unknots that are arbitrarily close to three circles, which themselves cannot be usedfigure to form the Borromean Rings.
