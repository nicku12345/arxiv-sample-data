The main result of this paper is that for every closed, connected, orientable, irreducible 3-manifold M, there is an integer  n_M such that any abstract graph with no automorphism of order 2 which has a 3-connected minor whose genus is more than n_M has no achiral embedding in M. By contrast, the paper also proves that for every graph \gamma, there are infinitely many closed, connected, orientable, irreducible 3-manifolds M such that some embedding of \gamma in M is pointwise fixed by an orientation reversing involution of M.
