On a smooth closed oriented 4-manifold M with a smooth action of a finite group G on a Spin^c structure, G-monopole invariant is defined by "counting" G-invariant solutions of Seiberg-Witten equations for any G-invariant Riemannian metric on M.   We compute G-monopole invariants on some G-manifolds. For example, the connected sum of k copies of a 4-manifold with nontrivial mod 2 Seiberg-Witten invariant has nonzero \Bbb Z_k-monopole invariant mod 2, where the \Bbb Z_k-action is given by cyclic permutations of k summands.
