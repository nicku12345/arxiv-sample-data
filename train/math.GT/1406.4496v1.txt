A 3-tangle T is the disjoint union of 3 properly embedded arcs in the unit 3-ball; it is called rational if there is a homeomorphism of pairs from (B^3,T) to (D^2\times I,\{x_1,x_2,x_3\}\times I). Two rational 3-tangles T and T' are isotopic if there is an orientation-preserving self-homeomorphism h: (B^3, T)\rightarrow (B^3,T') that is the identity map on the boundary. In this paper, we give an algorithm to check whether or not two rational 3-tangles are isotopic by using a modified version of Dehn's method for classifying simple closed curves on surfaces.
