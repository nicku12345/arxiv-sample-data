We first construct a genus zero positive allowable Lefschetz fibration over the disk (a genus zero PALF for short) on the Akbulut cork and describe the monodromy as a positive factorization in the mapping class group of a surface of genus zero with five boundary components. We then construct genus zero PALFs on infinitely many exotic pairs of compact Stein surfaces such that one is a cork twist of the other along an Akbulut cork. The difference of smooth structures on each of exotic pairs of compact Stein surface is interpreted as the difference of the corresponding positive factorizations in the mapping class group of a common surface of genus zero.
