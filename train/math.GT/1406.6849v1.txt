This paper presents results on the framization of some knot algebras, defined by the authors. We explain the motivations of the concept of framization, coming from the Yokonuma--Hecke algebras, as well as recent results on the framization of the Temperley--Lieb algebra. Finally, we propose framizations for other knot algebras such as the BMW algebra, the B--type related Hecke algebras and the singular Hecke algebra.
