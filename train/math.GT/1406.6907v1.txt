As has been observed by Morse \cite{Mo}, any generic vector field v on a compact smooth manifold X with boundary gives rise to a stratification of the boundary \d X by compact submanifolds \{\d_j^\pm X(v)\}_{1 \leq j \leq \dim(X)}, where \textup{codim}(\d_j^\pm X(v))= j.   Our main observation is that this stratification reflects the stratified convexity/concavity of the boundary \d X with respect to the v-flow. We study the behavior of this stratification under deformations of the vector field v. We also investigate the restrictions that the existence of a convex/concave traversing v-flow imposes on the topology of X.   Let v_1 be the orthogonal projection of v on the tangent bundle of \d X. We link the dynamics of the v_1-flow on the boundary with the property of v in X being convex/concave. This linkage is an instance of more general phenomenon that we call "holography of traversing fields"---a subject of a different paper to follow.
