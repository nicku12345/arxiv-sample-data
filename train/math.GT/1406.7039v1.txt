An alternating distance is a link invariant that measures how far away a link is from alternating. We study several alternating distances and demonstrate that there exist families of links for which the difference between certain alternating distances is arbitrarily large. We also show that two alternating distances, the alternation number and the alternating genus, are not comparable.
