We prove that there are exactly 6 Nil Seifert fibred spaces which can be obtained by Dehn surgeries on non-trefoil knots in S^3, with \{60, 144, 156, 288, 300\} as the exact set of all such surgery slopes up to taking the mirror images of the knots. We conjecture that there are exactly 4 specific hyperbolic knots in S^3 which admit Nil Seifert fibred surgery. We also give some more general results and a more general conjecture concerning Seifert fibred surgeries on hyperbolic knots in S^3.
