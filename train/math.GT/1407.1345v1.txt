Let X be a compact smooth manifold with boundary. In this article, we study the spaces \mathcal V^\dagger(X) and \mathcal V^\ddagger(X) of so called boundary generic and traversally generic vector fields on X and the place they occupy in the space \mathcal V(X) of all fields (see Theorems \ref{th3.4} and Theorem \ref{th3.5}). The definitions of boundary generic and traversally generic vector fields v are inspired by some classical notions from the singularity theory of smooth Bordman maps \cite{Bo}. Like in that theory (cf. \cite{Morin}), we establish local versal algebraic models for the way a sheaf of v-trajectories interacts with the boundary \d X. For fields from the space \mathcal V^\ddagger(X), the finite list of such models depends only on \dim(X); as a result, it is universal for all equidimensional manifolds. In specially adjusted coordinates, the boundary and the v-flow acquire descriptions in terms of universal deformations of real polynomials whose degrees do not exceed 2\cdot \dim(X).
