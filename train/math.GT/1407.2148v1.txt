Let M be a closed, oriented, connected 3--manifold and (B,\pi) an open book decomposition on M with page \Sigma and monodromy \varphi. It is easy to see that the first Betti number of \Sigma is bounded below by the number of S^2\times S^1--factors in the prime factorization of M. Our main result is that equality is realized if and only if \varphi is trivial and M is a connected sum of S^2\times S^1's. We also give some applications of our main result, such as a new proof of the result by Birman and Menasco that if the closure of a braid with n strands is the unlink with n components then the braid is trivial.
