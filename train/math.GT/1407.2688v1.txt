In this paper, we discuss the region unknotting number of different classes of 2-bridge knots. In particular, we provide region unknotting number for the classes of 2-bridge knots whose Conway notation is C(m,\ n), C(m,\ 2,\ m),  C(m,\ 2,\ m\pm1) and C(2,\ m,\ 2,\ n). By generalizing, we also provide a sharp upper bound for all the remaining classes of 2-bridge knots.
