In "A survey on the Turaev genus of knots," Champanerkar and Kofman propose several open questions. The first asks whether the polynomial whose coefficients count the number of quasi-trees of the all-A ribbon graph obtained from a diagram with minimal Turaev genus is an invariant of the knot. We answer negatively by showing a counterexample obtained from the two diagrams of 8_{21} on the KnotAtlas and KnotScape.
