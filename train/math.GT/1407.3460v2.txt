A graph is called intrinsically knotted if every embedding of the graph contains a knotted cycle. Johnson, Kidwell and Michael showed that intrinsically knotted graphs have at least 21 edges. Recently Lee, Kim, Lee and Oh, and, independently, Barsotti and Mattman, showed that K_7 and the 13 graphs obtained from K_7 by \nabla Y moves are the only intrinsically knotted graphs with 21 edges.   In this paper we present the following results: there are exactly three triangle-free intrinsically knotted graphs with 22 edges having at least two vertices of degree 5. Two are the cousins 94 and 110 of the E_9+e family and the third is a previously unknown graph named M_{11}. These graphs are shown in Figure 3 and 4. Furthermore, there is no triangle-free intrinsically knotted graph with 22 edges that has a vertex with degree larger than 5.
