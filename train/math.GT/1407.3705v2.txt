Let \Gamma be the fundamental group of the exterior of a knot in the three-sphere. We study deformations of representations of \Gamma into \mathrm{SL}_n(\mathbf{C}) which are the sum of two irreducible representations. For such representations we give a necessary condition, in terms of the twisted Alexander polynomial, for the existence of irreducible deformations. We also give a more restrictive sufficient condition for the existence of irreducible deformations. We also prove a duality theorem for twisted Alexander polynomials and we describe the local structure of the representation and character varieties.
