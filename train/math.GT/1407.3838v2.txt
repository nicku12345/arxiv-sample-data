Sullivan showed that there exists K_0 such that if \Omega\subset \hat{\mathbb{C}} is a simply connected hyperbolic domain, then there exists a conformally natural K_0-quasiconformal map from \Omega to the boundary {\rm Dome}(\Omega) of the convex hull of its complement which extends to the identity on \partial\Omega. Explicit upper and lower bounds on K_0 were obtained by Epstein, Marden, Markovic and Bishop. We improve on these bounds, by showing that one may choose K_0\le 7.1695.
