An (flat) affine 3-manifold is a 3-manifold with an atlas of charts to an affine space {\mathbf R}^3 with transition maps in the affine transformation group Aff({\mathbf R}^3). Equivalently an affine 3-manifold is a 3-manifold with a flat torsion-free affine connection. We show that a closed affine 3-manifold is either irreducible or is finitely covered by an affine Hopf manifold. A real projective 3-manifold is a manifold with an atlas of charts to a real projective space {\mathbf R} P^3 with transition maps in the projective transformation group PGL(4, {\mathbf R}). Using the convex concave decomposition of real projective manifolds, we will show that a closed real projective 3-manifold decomposes into concave affine submanifolds, toral \pi-submanifolds and 2-convex real projective manifolds.
