We characterize sequences of Kleinian surface groups with convergent subsequences in terms of the asymptotic behavior of the ending invariants of the associated hyperbolic 3-manifolds. Asymptotic behavior of end invariants in a convergent sequence predicts the parabolic locus of the algebraic limit as well as how the algebraic limit wraps within the geometric limit under the natural locally isometric covering map.
