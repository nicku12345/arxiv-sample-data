We study strip deformations of convex cocompact hyperbolic surfaces, defined by inserting hyperbolic strips along a collection of disjoint geodesic arcs properly embedded in the surface. We prove that any deformation of the surface that uniformly lengthens all closed geodesics can be realized as a strip deformation, in an essentially unique way. The infinitesimal version of this result gives a parameterization, by the arc complex, of the moduli space of Margulis spacetimes with fixed convex cocompact linear holonomy. As an application, we provide a new proof of the tameness of such Margulis spacetimes M by establishing the Crooked Plane Conjecture, which states that M admits a fundamental domain bounded by piecewise linear surfaces called crooked planes. The noninfinitesimal version gives an analogous theory for complete anti-de Sitter 3-manifolds.
