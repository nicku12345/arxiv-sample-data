Ozsvath-Stipsicz-Szabo recently defined a one-parameter family, upsilon of K at t, of concordance invariants associated to the knot Floer complex. We compare their invariant to the {-1, 0, 1}-valued concordance invariant epsilon, which is also associated to the knot Floer complex. In particular, we give an example of a knot K with upsilon uniformly equal to zero but epsilon non-zero.
