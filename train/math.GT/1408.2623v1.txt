We will define a version of Seiberg-Witten-Floer stable homotopy types for a closed, oriented 3-manifold Y with b_1(Y) > 0 and a spin-c structure \mathfrak{c} on Y with c_1(\mathfrak{c}) torsion under an assumption on Y. Using the Seiberg-Witten-Floer stable homotopy type, we will construct a gluing formula for the stable cohomotopy version of Seiberg-Witten invariants of a closed 4-manifold X which has a decomposition X = X_1 \cup_Y X_2 along Y.
