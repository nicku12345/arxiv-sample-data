We work entirely in the smooth category. An embedding f:(S^2\times S^1)\sqcup S^3\rightarrow {\mathbb R}^6 is {\it Brunnian}, if the restriction of f to each component is isotopic to the standard embedding. For each triple of integers k,m,n such that m\equiv n \pmod{2}, we explicitly construct a Brunnian embedding f_{k,m,n}:(S^2\times S^1)\sqcup S^3 \rightarrow {\mathbb R}^6 such that the following theorem holds.   Theorem: Any Brunnian embedding f:(S^2\times S^1)\sqcup S^3\rightarrow {\mathbb R}^6 is isotopic to f_{k,m,n} for some integers k,m,n such that m\equiv n \pmod{2}. Two embeddings f_{k,m,n} and f_{k',m',n'} are isotopic if and only if k=k', m\equiv m' \pmod{2k} and n\equiv n' \pmod{2k}.   We use Haefliger's classification of embeddings S^3\sqcup S^3\rightarrow {\mathbb R}^6 in our proof. The following corollary shows that the relation between the embeddings (S^2\times S^1)\sqcup S^3\rightarrow {\mathbb R}^6 and S^3\sqcup S^3\rightarrow {\mathbb R}^6 is not trivial.   Corollary: There exist embeddings f:(S^2\times S^1)\sqcup S^3\rightarrow {\mathbb R}^6 and g,g':S^3\sqcup S^3\rightarrow {\mathbb R}^6 such that the componentwise embedded connected sum f\#g is isotopic to f\#g' but g is not isotopic to g'.
