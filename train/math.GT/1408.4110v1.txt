Given a knot K in S^3, a question raised by Cappell and Shaneson asks if the meridional rank of K equals the bridge number of K. Using augmentations in knot contact homology we consider the persistence of equality between these two invariants under satellite operations on K with a braid pattern. In particular, we answer the question in the affirmative for a large class of iterated torus knots.
