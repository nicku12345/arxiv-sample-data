The complex of curves \mathcal{C}(S_g) of a closed orientable surface of genus g \geq 2 is the simplicial complex having its vertices, \mathcal{C}^0(S_g), are isotopy classes of essential curves in S_g. Two vertices co-bound an edge of the 1-skeleton, \mathcal{C}^1(S_g), if there are disjoint representatives in S_g. A metric is obtained on \mathcal{C}^0(S_g) by assigning unit length to each edge of \mathcal{C}^1(S_g). Thus, the distance between two vertices, d(v,w), corresponds to the length of a geodesic---a shortest edge-path between v and w in \mathcal{C}^1 (S_g). Recently, Birman, Margalit and the second author introduced the concept of {\em initially efficient geodesics} in \mathcal{C}^1(S_g) and used them to give a new algorithm for computing the distance between vertices. In this note we introduce the software package MICC ({\em Metric in the Curve Complex}), a partial implementation of the initially efficient geodesic algorithm. We discuss the mathematics underlying MICC and give applications. In particular, we give examples of distance four vertex pairs, for g=2 and 3. Previously, there was only one known example, in genus 2, due to John Hempel.
