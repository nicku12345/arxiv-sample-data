We define invariants \frak{ds} and \overline{\frak{ds}}, which are the maximal and minimal second Betti number divided by 8 among definite spin boundings of a homology sphere. The similar invariants g_8 and \overline{g_8} are defined by the maximal (or minimal) product sum of E_8-form of bounding 4-manifolds. We compute these invariants for some homology spheres. We construct E_8-boundings for some of Brieskorn 3-spheres \Sigma(2,3,12n+5) by handle decomposition. As a by-product of the construction, some negative classes which consist of addition of several fiber classes plus one sectional class in E(1) are represented by spheres.
