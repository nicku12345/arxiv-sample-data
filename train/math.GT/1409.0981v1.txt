Let K be a tunnel number two knot. Then, by considering the (g, b)-decompositions, K is one of (3, 0)-, (2, 1)-, (1, 2)- or (0, 3)-knots. In the present paper, we analyze the connected sum summands of composite tunnel number two knots and give a complete table of those summands from the point of view of (g, b)-decompositions.
