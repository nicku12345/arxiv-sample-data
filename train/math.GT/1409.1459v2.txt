Given a virtual knot K, we construct a group VG_K called the virtual knot group, and we use the elementary ideals of VG_K to define invariants of K called the virtual Alexander invariants. For instance, associated to the k=0 ideal is a polynomial H_K(s,t,q) in three variables which we call the virtual Alexander polynomial, and we show that it is closely related to the generalized Alexander polynomial G_K(s,t) introduced by Sawollek, Kauffman-Radford, and Silver-Williams. We define a natural normalization of the virtual Alexander polynomial and show it satisfies a skein formula. We also introduce the twisted virtual Alexander polynomial associated to a virtual knot K and a representation \varrho \colon VG_K \to GL_n(R), and we define a normalization of the twisted virtual Alexander polynomial. As applications we derive bounds on the virtual crossing numbers of virtual knots from the virtual Alexander polynomial and twisted virtual Alexander polynomial.
