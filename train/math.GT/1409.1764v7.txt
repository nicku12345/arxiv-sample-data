When a boudnary-parabolic representation of a link group to PSL(2,\mathbb{C}) is given, Inoue and Kabaya suggested a combinatorial method to obtain the developing map of the representation using the octahedral triangulation and the shadow-coloring of certain quandle. Quandle is an algebraic system closely related with the Reidemeister moves, so their method changes quite naturally under the Reidemeister moves.   In this article, we apply their method to the potential function, which was used to define the optimsitic limit, and construct a saddle point of the function. This construction works for any boundary-parabolic representation, and it shows that the octahedral triangulation is good enough to study all possible boundary-parabolic representations of the link group. Furthermore the evaluation of the potential function at the saddle point becomes the complex volume of the representation, and this saddle point changes naturally under the Reidemeister moves because it is constructed using the quandle.
