Subdivision rules create sequences of nested cell structures on CW-complexes, and they frequently arise from groups. In this paper, we develop several tools for classifying subdivision rules. We give a criterion for a subdivision rule to represent a Gromov hyperbolic space, and show that a subdivision rule for a hyperbolic group determines the Gromov boundary. We give a criterion for a subdivision rule to represent a Euclidean space of dimension less than 4. We also show that Nil and Sol geometries can not be modeled by subdivision rules. We use these tools and previous theorems to classify the geometry of subdivision rules for low-dimensional geometric groups by the combinatorial properties of their subdivision rules.
