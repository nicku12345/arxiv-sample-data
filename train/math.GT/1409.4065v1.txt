For a Lattice crossing L\left( m,n\right)  we show which Catalan connection between 2\left( m+n\right)  points on boundary of m\times n rectangle P can be realized as a Kauffman state and we give an explicit formula for the number of such Catalan connections. For the case of a Catalan connection with no arc starting and ending on the same side of the tangle, we find a closed formula for its coefficient in the Relative Kauffman Bracket Skein Module of P\times I
