We study the behavior of the signature of colored links [Flo05, CF08] under the splice operation. We extend the construction to colored links in integral homology spheres and show that the signature is almost additive, with a correction term independent of the links. We interpret this correction term as the signature of a generalized Hopf link and give a simple closed formula to compute it.
