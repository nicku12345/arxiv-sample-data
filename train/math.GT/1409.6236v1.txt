We use an algorithm by Ozsvath and Szabo to find closed formulae for the ranks of the hat version of the Heegaard Floer homology groups for non-zero Dehn surgeries on knots in the 3-sphere. As applications we provide new bounds on the number of distinct ranks of the Heegaard Floer groups a Dehn surgery can have. These in turn give a new lower bound on the rational Dehn surgery genus of a rational homology 3-sphere. We also provide novel obstructions for a knot to be a potential counterexample to the Cabling Conjecture.
