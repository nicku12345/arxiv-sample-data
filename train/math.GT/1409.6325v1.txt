The action dimension of a discrete group \Gamma is the smallest dimension of a contractible manifold which admits a proper action of \Gamma. Associated to any flag complex L there is a right-angled Artin group, A_L. We compute the action dimension of A_L for many L. Our calculations come close to confirming the conjecture that if an \ell^2-Betti number of A_L in degree l is nonzero, then the action dimension of A_L is \ge 2l.
