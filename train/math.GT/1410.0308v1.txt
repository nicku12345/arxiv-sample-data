A rational knot or link can be put into a standard alternating format which has horizontal and vertical twist sites (double helices). The number and type of these twist sites are determined by terms of next-to-highest z-degree in Kauffman's regular isotopy invariant \Lambda(a,z). In particular, for a knot or link with c crossings, the coefficient of the z^{c-2} term is equal to the number of twist sites in its standard diagram. Furthermore, the coefficients of the a^{-2}z^{c-2} and a^2z^{c-2} terms count the number of left-turning and right-turning twist sites, respectively.
