For a fixed marked surface S, we construct polynomial bounds on the periodic and preperiodic lengths of the maximal splitting sequences of a projectively invariant measured train track.   We give two consequences of these bounds. Firstly, that the problem of deciding whether a mapping class is pseudo-Anosov lies in \textbf{NP}. This is dual to the previously known result that the pseudo-Anosov problem is in \textbf{co-NP}. Secondly, that the problem of deciding whether two mapping classes are conjugate lies in \textbf{co-NP}. Similarly, this is the dual to the previously known result that the conjugacy problem is in \textbf{NP}.   As usual, in both cases we immediately obtain exponential time solutions to these problems. A version of these algorithms have been implemented as part of flipper.
