We prove Nielsen realisation for finite subgroups of the groups of untwisted outer automorphisms of RAAGs in the following sense: given any graph \Gamma, and any finite group G\leqslant \mathrm{U}^0(A_\Gamma) \leqslant \mathrm{Out}^0(A_\Gamma), we find a non-positively curved cube complex with fundamental group A_\Gamma on which G acts by isometries, realising the action on A_\Gamma.
