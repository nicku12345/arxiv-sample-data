The set consisting of all rotations of the Euclidean plane is equipped with a quandle structure. We show that a knot is colorable by this quandle if and only if its Alexander polynomial has a root on the unit circle in \mathbb{C}. Further we enumerate all non-trivial colorings of a torus knot diagram by the quandle using PL trochoids. As an application of these results, we have the complete factorization of the Alexander polynomial of the torus knot.
