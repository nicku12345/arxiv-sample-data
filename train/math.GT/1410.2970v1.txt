We show that a PSL(2;R)-representation of a Fuchsian group induces the asymptotics of the Reidemeister torsion for the Seifert manifold corresponding to the euler class of the PSL(2;R)-representation. We also show that the limit of leading coefficient of the Reidemeister torsion is determined by the euler class of a PSL(2;R)-representation of a Fuchsian group. In particular, the leading coefficient of the Reidemeister torsion for the unit tangent bundle over a two-orbifold converges to -\chi \log2 where \chi is the Euler characteristic of the two-orbifold. We also give a relation between \mathbb{Z}_2-extensions for PSL(2;R)-representations of a Fuchsian group and the asymptotics of the Reidemeister torsion.
