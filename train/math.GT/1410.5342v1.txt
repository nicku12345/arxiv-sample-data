We show that the correction terms in Heegaard Floer homology give a lower bound to the the genus of one-sided Heegaard splittings and the \mathbb Z_2--Thurston norm. Using a result of Jaco--Rubinstein--Tillmann, this gives a lower bound to the complexity of certain closed 3--manifolds. As an application, we compute the \mathbb Z_2--Thurston norm of the double branched cover of some closed 3--braids, and give upper and lower bounds for the complexity of these manifolds.
