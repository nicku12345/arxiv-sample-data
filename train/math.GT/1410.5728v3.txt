We show that all knots up to 6 crossings can be represented by polynomial knots of degree at most 7, among which except for 5_2, 5_2^*, 6_1, 6_1^*, 6_2, 6_2^* and 6_3 all are in their minimal degree representation. We provide concrete polynomial representation of all these knots. Durfee and O'Shea had asked a question: Is there any 5 crossing knot in degree 6? In this paper we try to partially answer this question. For an integer d\geq2, we define a set \mathcal{\tilde{P}}_d to be the set of all polynomial knots given by t\mapsto\big(f(t),g(t),h(t)\big) such that \text{deg}(f)=d-2, \text{deg}(g)=d-1 and \text{deg}(h)=d. This set can be identified with a subset of \mathbb{R}^{3d} and thus it is equipped with the natural topology which comes from the usual topology \mathbb{R}^{3d}. In this paper we determine a lower bound on the number of path components of \mathcal{\tilde{P}}_d for d\leq 7. We define a path equivalence for polynomial knots in the space \mathcal{\tilde{P}}_d and show that it is stronger than the topological equivalence.
