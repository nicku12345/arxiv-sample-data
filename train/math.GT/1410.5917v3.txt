We have defined weight of the pair (\langle S \mid R \rangle, R) for a given presentation \langle S \mid R \rangle of a group, where the number of generators is equal to the number of relations. We present an algorithm to construct crystallizations of 3-manifolds whose fundamental group has a presentation with two generators and two relations. If the weight of (\langle S \mid R \rangle, R) is n then our algorithm constructs all the n-vertex crystallizations which yield (\langle S \mid R \rangle, R). As an application, we have constructed some new crystallizations of 3-manifolds.   We have generalized our algorithm for presentations with three generators and certain class of relations. For m\geq 3 and m \geq n \geq k \geq 2, our generalized algorithm gives a 2(2m+2n+2k-6+\delta_n^2 + \delta_k^2)-vertex crystallization of the closed connected orientable 3-manifold M\langle m,n,k \rangle having fundamental group \langle x_1,x_2,x_3 \mid x_1^m=x_2^n=x_3^k=x_1x_2x_3 \rangle. These crystallizations are minimal and unique with respect to the given presentations. If `n=2' or `k\geq 3 and m \geq 4' then our crystallization of M\langle m,n,k \rangle is vertex-minimal for all the known cases.
