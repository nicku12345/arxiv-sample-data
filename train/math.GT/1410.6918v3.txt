We introduce L^2-Alexander torsions for 3-manifolds, which can be viewed as a generalization of the L^2-Alexander polynomial of Li--Zhang. We state the L^2-Alexander torsions for graph manifolds and we partially compute them for fibered manifolds. We furthermore show that given any irreducible 3-manifold there exists a coefficient system such that the corresponding L^2-torsion detects the Thurston norm.
