We show that Galois conjugates of stretch factors of pseudo-Anosov mapping classes arising from Penner's construction lie off the unit circle. As a consequence, we show that for all but a few exceptional surfaces, there are examples of pseudo-Anosov mapping classes so that no power of them arises from Penner's construction. This resolves a conjecture of Penner.
