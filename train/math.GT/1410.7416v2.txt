By evaluating the Burau representation at t=-1, we obtain a symplectic representation of the braid group. We study the resulting congruence subgroups of the braid group, namely, the preimages of the principal congruence subgroups of the symplectic group. Our main result is that the level 4 congruence subgroup is equal to the group generated by squares of Dehn twists. We also show that the image of the Brunnian subgroup of the braid group under the symplectic representation is the level four congruence subgroup.
