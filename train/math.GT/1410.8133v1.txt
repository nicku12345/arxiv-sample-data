We show that the only closed 4-manifolds admitting genus two trisections are S^2 \times S^2 and connected sums of S^1 \times S^3, \mathbb{CP}^2, and \overline{\mathbb{CP}}^2 with two summands. Moreover, each of these manifolds admits a unique genus two trisection up to diffeomorphism. The proof relies heavily on the combinatorics of genus two Heegaard diagrams of S^3. As a corollary, we classify two-component links contained in a genus two Heegaard surface for S^3 with a surface-sloped cosmetic Dehn surgery.
