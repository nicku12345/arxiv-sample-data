We study the possibility of realizing exotic smooth structures on punctured simply connected 4-manifolds as leaves of a codimension one foliation on a compact manifold. In particular, we show the existence of uncountably many smooth open 4-manifolds which are not diffeomorphic to any leaf of a codimension one transversely C^{2} foliation on a compact manifold. These examples include some exotic {\mathbb R}^4's and exotic cylinders S^3\times{\mathbb R}.
