Given a reduced alternating diagram for a link, we obtain conditions that guarantee that the link complement has a complete hyperbolic structure, crossing arcs are the edges of an ideal geodesic triangulation, and every crossing arc is isotopic to a simple geodesic. The latter was conjectured by Sakuma and Weeks in 1995. We provide infinite families of closed braids for which our conditions hold.
