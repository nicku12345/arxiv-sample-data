A (flat) affine 3-manifold is a 3-manifold with an atlas of charts to an affine space \mathbb{R}^3 with transition maps in the affine transformation group \mathrm{Aff}(\mathbb{R}^3). We will show that a connected closed affine 3-manifold is either an affine Hopf 3-manifold or decomposes canonically to concave affine submanifolds with incompressible boundary, toral \pi-submanifolds and 2-convex affine manifolds, each of which is an irreducible 3-manifold. It follows that if there is no toral \pi-submanifold, then M is prime. Finally, we prove that if a closed affine manifold is covered by a domain in \mathbb{R}^{n}, then M is irreducible or is an affine Hopf manifold.
