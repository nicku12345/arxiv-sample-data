We classify 5-manifolds with fundamental group \mathbb Z and \pi_{2} a finitely generated abelian group in terms of the cup product on the second cohomology of the universal covering. The classification result is applied to study simple knots k \colon S^{3} \subset S^{5} and the question, which compact topological or smooth orientable 5-manifold is a topological or smooth fibre bundle over the circle with simply-connected fibre.
