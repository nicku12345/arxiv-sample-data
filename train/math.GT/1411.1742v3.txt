A Morse 2-function is a generic smooth map from a manifold M of arbitrary finite dimension to a surface B. Its critical set maps to an immersed collection of cusped arcs in B. The aim of this paper is to explain exactly when it is possible to move these arcs around in B by a homotopy and to give a library of examples when M is a closed 4-manifold. The last two sections give applications to the theory of crown diagrams of smooth 4-manifolds.
