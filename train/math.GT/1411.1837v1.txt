A graph is intrinsically knotted if every embedding contains a knotted cycle. It is known that intrinsically knotted graphs have at least 21 edges and that the KS graphs, K_7 and the 13 graphs obtained from K_7 by \nabla Y moves, are the only minor minimal intrinsically knotted graphs with 21 edges. This set includes exactly one bipartite graph, the Heawood graph.   In this paper we classify the intrinsically knotted bipartite graphs with at most 22 edges. Previously known examples of intrinsically knotted graphs of size 22 were those with KS graph minor and the 168 graphs in the K_{3,3,1,1} and E_9+e families. Among these, the only bipartite example with no Heawood subgraph is Cousin 110 of the E_9+e family. We show that, in fact, this is a complete listing. That is, there are exactly two graphs of size at most 22 that are minor minimal bipartite intrinsically knotted: the Heawood graph and Cousin 110.
