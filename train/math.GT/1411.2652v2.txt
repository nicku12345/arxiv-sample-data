Let C and D be a pair of crumpled n-cubes and h a homeomorphism of \text{Bd }C to \text{Bd }D for which there exists a map f_h: C\to D such that f_h|\text{Bd }C =h and f_{h}^{-1}(\text{Bd }D)=\text{Bd }C. In our view the presence of such a triple (C,D,h) suggests that C is "at least as wild as" D. The collection \mathscr{W}_n of all such triples is the subject of this paper. If (C,D,h)\in \mathscr{W}_n but there is no homeomorphism such that D is at least as wild as C, we say C is "strictly wilder than" D. The latter concept imposes a partial order on the collection of crumpled n-cubes. Here we study features of these wildness comparisons, and we present certain attributes of crumpled cubes that are preserved by the maps arising when (C,D,h) \in \mathscr{W}_n. The effort can be viewed as an initial way of classifying the wildness of crumpled cubes.
