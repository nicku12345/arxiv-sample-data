As an example of the transitions between some of the eight geometries of Thurston, investigated before, we study the geometries supported by the cone-manifolds obtained by surgery on the trefoil knot with singular set the core of the surgery. The geometric structures are explicitly constructed. The most interesting phenomenon is the transition from SL(2,\mathbb{R})-geometry to S^{3}-geometry through Nil-geometry. A plot of the different geometries is given, in the spirit of the analogous plot of Thurston for the geometries supported by surgeries on the figure-eight knot.
