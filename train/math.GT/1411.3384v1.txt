We study quotients \Gamma\backslash \mathbb H^n of the n-fold product of the upper half plane \mathbb H by irreducible and torsion-free lattices \Gamma < PSL_2(\mathbb R)^n with the same Betti numbers as the n-fold product (\mathbb P^1)^n of projective lines. Such varieties are called fake products of projective lines or fake (\mathbb P^1)^n. These are higher dimensional analogs of fake quadrics. In this paper we show that the number of fake (\mathbb P^1)^n is finite (independently of n), we give examples of fake (\mathbb P^1)^4 and show that for n>4 there are no fake (\mathbb P^1)^n of the form \Gamma\backslash \mathbb H^n with \Gamma contained in the norm-1 group of a maximal order of a quaternion algebra over a real number field.
