For a closed 4-manifold X and a knot K in the boundary of punctured X, we define \gamma_X^0(K) to be the smallest first Betti number of non-orientable and null-homologous surfaces in punctured X with boundary K. Note that \gamma^0_{S^4} is equal to the non-orientable 4-ball genus and hence \gamma^0_X is a generalization of the non-orientable 4-ball genus. While it is very likely that for given X, \gamma^0_X has no upper bound, it is difficult to show it. In fact, even in the case of \gamma^0_{S^4}, its non-boundedness was shown for the first time by Batson in 2012. In this paper, we prove that for any Spin 4-manifold X, \gamma^0_X has no upper bound.
