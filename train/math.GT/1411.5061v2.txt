We give counterexamples to a question of Bowditch that if a non-elementary type-preserving representation \rho:\pi_1(\Sigma_{g,n})\rightarrow PSL(2;\mathbb R) of a punctured surface group sends every non-peripheral simple closed curve to a hyperbolic element, then must \rho be Fuchsian. The counterexamples come from relative Euler class \pm1 representations of the four-punctured sphere group. We also show that the mapping class group action on each non-extremal component of the character space of type-preserving representations of the four-punctured sphere group is ergodic, which confirms a conjecture of Goldman for this case. The main tool we use is Kashaev-Penner's lengths coordinates of the decorated character spaces.
