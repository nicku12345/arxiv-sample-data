In this paper, we extend the definition of the SL_2(\Bbb C) Casson invariant to arbitrary knots K in integral homology 3-spheres and relate it to the m-degree of the \widehat{A}-polynomial of K. We prove a product formula for the \widehat{A}-polynomial of the connected sum K_1 \# K_2 of two knots in S^3 and deduce additivity of SL_2(\Bbb C) Casson knot invariant under connected sum for a large class of knots in S^3. We also present an example of a nontrivial knot K in S^3 with trivial \widehat{A}-polynomial and trivial SL_2(\Bbb C) Casson knot invariant, showing that neither of these invariants detect the unknot.
