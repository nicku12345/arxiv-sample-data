The relative chromatic number c\_0(S) of a compact surface S with boundary is defined as the supremum of the chromatic numbers of graphs embedded in S with all vertices on \partial S. This topological invariant was introduced for the study of the multiplicity of the first Steklov eigenvalue of S. In this article, we show that c\_0(S) is also relevant for the study of tight polyhedral embeddings of S byproving two results. The first one is that if there is a tight polyhedral embedding of S in \R^n which is not contained in a hyperplane, then n\leq c\_0(S)-1. The second result is that this inequality is sharp for surfaces of small genus.
