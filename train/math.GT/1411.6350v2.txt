Thanks to a recent result by Jean-Marc Schlenker, we establish an explicit linear inequality between the normalized entropies of pseudo-Anosov automorphisms and the hyperbolic volumes of their mapping tori. As its corollaries, we give an improved lower bound for values of entropies of pseudo-Anosovs on a surface with fixed topology, and a proof of a slightly weaker version of the result by Farb, Leininger and Margalit first, and by Agol later, on finiteness of cusped manifolds generating surface automorphisms with small normalized entropies. Also, we present an analogous linear inequality between the Weil-Petersson translation distance of a pseudo-Anosov map (normalized by multiplying the square root of the area of a surface) and the volume of its mapping torus, which leads to a better bound.
