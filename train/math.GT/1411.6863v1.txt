Let f:M\to \mathbb{R} be a Morse function on a connected compact surface M, and \mathcal{S}(f) and \mathcal{O}(f) be respectively the stabilizer and the orbit of f with respect to the right action of the group of diffeomorphisms \mathcal{D}(M). In a series of papers the first author described the homotopy types of connected components of \mathcal{S}(f) and \mathcal{O}(f) for the cases when M is either a 2-disk or a cylinder or \chi(M)<0. Moreover, in two recent papers the authors considered special classes of smooth functions on 2-torus T^2 and shown that the computations of \pi_1\mathcal{O}(f) for those functions reduces to the cases of 2-disk and cylinder.   In the present paper we consider another class of Morse functions f:T^2\to\mathbb{R} whose KR-graphs have exactly one cycle and prove that for every such function there exists a subsurface Q\subset T^2, diffeomorphic with a cylinder, such that \pi_1\mathcal{O}(f) is expressed via the fundamental group \pi_1\mathcal{O}(f|_{Q}) of the restriction of f to Q.   This result holds for a larger class of smooth functions f:T^2\to \mathbb{R} having the following property: for every critical point z of f the germ of f at z is smoothly equivalent to a homogeneous polynomial \mathbb{R}^2\to \mathbb{R} without multiple factors.
