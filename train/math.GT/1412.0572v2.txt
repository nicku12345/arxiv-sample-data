Work of Ni and Zhang has shown that for the torus knot T_{r,s} with r>s>1 every surgery slope p/q \geq \frac{30}{67}(r^2-1)(s^2-1) is a characterizing slope. In this paper, we show that this can be lowered to a bound which is linear in rs, namely, p/q\geq \frac{43}{4}(rs-r-s). The main technical ingredient in this improvement is to show that if Y is an L-space bounding a sharp 4-manifold which is obtained by p/q-surgery on a knot K in S^3 and p/q exceeds 4g(K)+4, then the Alexander polynomial of K is uniquely determined by Y and p/q. We also show that if p/q-surgery on K bounds a sharp 4-manifold, then S^3_{p'/q'}(K) bounds a sharp 4-manifold for all p'/q'\geq p/q.
