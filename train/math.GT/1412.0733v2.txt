A recent preprint of S. Kojima and G. McShane [KM] observes a beautiful explicit connection between Teichm\"uller translation distance and hyperbolic volume. It relies on a key estimate which we supply here: using geometric inflexibility of hyperbolic 3-manifolds, we show that for S a closed surface, and \psi \in \text{Mod}(S) pseudo-Anosov, the double iteration Q(\psi^{-n}(X),\psi^n(X)) has convex core volume differing from 2n \text{vol}(M_\psi) by a uniform additive constant, where M_\psi is the hyperbolic mapping torus for \psi. We combine this estimate with work of Schlenker, and a branched covering argument to obtain an explicit lower bound on Weil-Petersson translation distance of a pseudo-Anosov \psi \in \text{Mod}(S) for general compact S of genus g with n boundary components: we have  \text{vol}(M_\psi) \le 3 \sqrt{\pi/2(2g - 2 +n)} \, \| \psi \|_{WP}. This gives the first explicit estimates on the Weil-Petersson systoles of moduli space, of the minimal distance between nodal surfaces in the completion of Teichm\"uller space, and explicit lower bounds to the Weil-Petersson diameter of the moduli space via [CP]. In the process, we recover the estimates of [KM] on Teichm\"uller translation distance via a Cauchy-Schwarz estimate (see [Lin]).
