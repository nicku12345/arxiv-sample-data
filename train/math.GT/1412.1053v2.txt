The AJ-conjecture for a knot K \subset S^3 relates the A-polynomial and the colored Jones polynomial of K. If a two-bridge knot K satisfies the AJ-conjecture, we give sufficient conditions on K for the (r,2)-cable knot C to also satisfy the AJ-conjecture. If a reduced alternating diagram of K has \eta_+ positive crossings and \eta_- negative crossings, then C will satisfy the AJ-conjecture when (r+4\eta_-)(r-4\eta_+)>0 and the conditions of the main theorem are satisfied.
