In 1986, W. Thurston introduced a (possibly degenerate) norm on the first cohomology group of a 3-manifold. Inspired by this definition, Turaev introduced in 2002 a analogous norm on the first cohomology group of a finite 2-complex. We show that if N is the exterior of a link in a rational homology sphere, then the Thurston norm agrees with a suitable variation of Turaev's norm defined on any 2-skeleton of N.
