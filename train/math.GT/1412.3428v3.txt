If \Gamma<\mathrm{PSL}(2,\mathbb{C}) is a lattice, we define an invariant of a representation \Gamma\rightarrow \mathrm{PSL}(n,\mathbb{C}) using the Borel class \beta(n)\in \mathrm{H}^3_\mathrm{c}(\mathrm{PSL}(n,\mathbb{C}),\mathbb{R}). We show that the invariant is bounded and its maximal value is attained by conjugation of the composition of the lattice embedding with the irreducible complex representation \mathrm{PSL}(2,\mathbb{C})\rightarrow \mathrm{PSL}(n,\mathbb{C}).   Major ingredients of independent interest are the extension to degenerate configuration of flags of a Goncharov cocycle and its study, as well as the identification of \mathrm{H}^3_\mathrm{c}(\mathrm{SL}(n,\mathbb{C}),\mathbb{R}) as a normed space.
