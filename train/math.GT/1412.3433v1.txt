We prove that for particular infinite families of L-spaces, arising as branched double covers, the d-invariants defined by Ozsv\'ath and Szab\'o are arbitrarily large and small. As a consequence, we generalise a result by Greene and Watson by proving, for every odd number \Delta \geq 5, the existence of infinitely many non-quasi-alternating homologically thin knots with determinant \Delta^2, and a result by Hoffman and Walsh concerning the existence of hyperbolic weight 1 manifolds that are not surgery on a knot in S^3.
