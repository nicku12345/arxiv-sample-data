Lomonaco and Kauffman developed a knot mosaic system to introduce a precise and workable definition of a quantum knot system. This definition is intended to represent an actual physical quantum system. A knot (m,n)-mosaic is an m \times n matrix of mosaic tiles (T_0 through T_{10} depicted in the introduction) representing a knot or a link by adjoining properly that is called suitably connected. D^{(m,n)} is the total number of all knot (m,n)-mosaics. This value indicates the dimension of the Hilbert space of these quantum knot system. D^{(m,n)} is already found for m,n \leq 6 by the authors.   In this paper, we construct an algorithm producing the precise value of D^{(m,n)} for m,n \geq 2 that uses recurrence relations of state matrices that turn out to be remarkably efficient to count knot mosaics.  D^{(m,n)} = 2 \, \| (X_{m-2}+O_{m-2})^{n-2} \|  where 2^{m-2} \times 2^{m-2} matrices X_{m-2} and O_{m-2} are defined by  X_{k+1} = \begin{bmatrix} X_k & O_k \\ O_k & X_k \end{bmatrix} \ \mbox{and } \ O_{k+1} = \begin{bmatrix} O_k & X_k \\ X_k & 4 \, O_k \end{bmatrix}  for k=0,1, \cdots, m-3, with 1 \times 1 matrices X_0 = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \end{bmatrix} and O_0 = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \end{bmatrix}. Here \|N\| denotes the sum of all entries of a matrix N. For n=2, (X_{m-2}+O_{m-2})^0 means the identity matrix of size 2^{m-2} \times 2^{m-2}.
