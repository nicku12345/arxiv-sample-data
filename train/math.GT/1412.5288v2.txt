A marked graph diagram is a link diagram possibly with marked 4-valent vertices. S. J. Lomonaco, Jr. and K. Yoshikawa introduced a method of representing surface-links by marked graph diagrams. Specially, K. Yoshikawa gave local moves on marked graph diagrams, nowadays called Yoshikawa moves. It is now known that two marked graph diagrams representing equivalent surface-links are related by a finite sequence of these Yoshikawa moves. In this paper, we provide some generating sets of Yoshikawa moves on marked graph diagrams representing unoriented surface-links, and also oriented surface-links. We also discuss independence of certain Yoshikawa moves from the other moves.
