We study surface groups \Gamma in SO(4,1), which is the group of Mobius tranformations of S^3, and also the group of isometries of \mathbb{H}^4. We consider such \Gamma so that its limit set \Lambda_\Gamma is a quasi-circle in S^3, and so that the quotient (S^3 - \Lambda_\Gamma) / \Gamma is a circle bundle over a surface. This circle bundle is said to be conformally flat, and our main goal is to discover how twisted such bundle may be by establishing a bound on its Euler number. By combinatorial approaches, we have two soft bounds in this direction on certain types of nice structures. In this article we also construct new examples, a "grafting" type path in the space of surface group representations into SO(4,1): starting inside the quasi-Fuschsian locus, going through non-discrete territory and back.
