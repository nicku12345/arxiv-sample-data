When the signed weighted resolution set was defined as an invariant of pseudoknots, it was unknown whether this invariant was complete. Using the Gauss-diagrammatic invariants of pseudoknots introduced by Dorais et al, we show that the signed were-set cannot distinguish all non-equivalent pseudoknots. This goal is achieved through studying the effects of a flype-like local move on a pseudodiagram.
