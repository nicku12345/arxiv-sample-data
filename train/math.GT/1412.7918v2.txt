Let \Gamma be a nonelementary discrete subgroup of SU(n,1) or Sp(n,1). We show that if the trace field of \Gamma is contained in \mathbb R, \Gamma preserves a totally geodesic submanifold of constant negative sectional curvature. Furthermore if \Gamma is irreducible, \Gamma is a Zariski dense irreducible discrete subgroup of SO(n,1) up to conjugation. This is an analog of a theorem of Maskit for general semisimple Lie groups of rank 1.
