We define an elementary relatively \mathbb Z/4 graded Lagrangian-Floer chain complex for restricted immersions of compact 1-manifolds into the pillowcase, and apply it to the intersection diagram obtained by taking traceless SU(2) character varieties of 2-tangle decompositions of knots. Calculations for torus knots are explained in terms of pictures in the punctured plane. The relation to the reduced instanton homology of knots is explored.
