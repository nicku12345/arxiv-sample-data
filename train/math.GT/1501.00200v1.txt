We analyze the asymptotic cones of Teichm\"uller space with the Teichm\"uller metric, (\mathcal{T}(S),d_T). We give a new proof of a theorem of Eskin-Masur-Rafi which bounds the dimension of quasiisometrically embedded flats in (\mathcal{T}(S),d_T). Our approach is an application of the ideas of Behrstock and Behrstock-Minsky to the quasiisometry model we previously built for (\mathcal{T}(S),d_T).
