We derive an adjunction inequality for any smooth, closed, connected, oriented 4-manifold X with b^+=1. This inequality depends only on the cohomology algebra and generalizes the inequality of Strle in the case of b_1=0. We demonstrate that the inequality is especially powerful when 2\tilde \chi+3\sigma\geq 0, where \tilde \chi is the modified Euler number taking account of the cup product on H^1.
