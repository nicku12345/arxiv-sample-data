In this master thesis, I present a new family of knots in the solid torus called lassos, and their properties. Given a knot K with Alexander polynomial \Delta_K(t), I then use these lassos as patterns to construct families of satellite knots that have Alexander polynomial \Delta_K(t^d) where d\in\mathbb{N}\cup \{0\}. In particular, I prove that if d\in\{0,1,2,3\} these satellite knots have different Jones polynomials. For this purpose, I give rise to a formula for calculating the Jones polynomial of a satellite knot in terms of the Jones polynomials of its pattern and companion.
