We call a knot in the 3-sphere SU(2)-simple if all representations of the fundamental group of its complement which map a meridian to a trace-free element in SU(2) are binary dihedral. This is a generalisation of being a 2-bridge knot. Pretzel knots with bridge number \geq 3 are not SU(2)-simple. We provide an infinite family of knots K with bridge number \geq 3 which are SU(2)-simple.   One expects the instanton knot Floer homology I^\natural(K) of a SU(2)-simple knot to be as small as it can be -- of rank equal to the knot determinant \det(K). In fact, the complex underlying I^\natural(K) is of rank equal to \det(K), provided a genericity assumption holds that is reasonable to expect. Thus formally there is a resemblance to strong L-spaces in Heegaard Floer homology. For the class of SU(2)-simple knots that we introduce this formal resemblance is reflected topologically: The branched double covers of these knots are strong L-spaces. In fact, somewhat surprisingly, these knots are alternating. However, the Conway spheres are hidden in any alternating diagram.   With the methods we use, we show that an integer homology 3-sphere which is a graph manifold always admits irreducible representations of its fundamental group.
