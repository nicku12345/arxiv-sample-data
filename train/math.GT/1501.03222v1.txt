The main goal of this article is to obtain a condition under which an infinite collection \mathscr{F} of satellite knots (with companion a positive torus knot and pattern similar to the Whitehead link) freely generates a subgroup of infinite rank in the smooth concordance group. This goal is attained by examining both the instanton moduli space over a 4-manifold with tubular ends and the corresponding Chern-Simons invariant of the adequate 3-dimensional portion of the 4-manifold. More specifically, the result is derived from Furuta's criterion for the independence of Seifert fibred homology spheres in the homology cobordism group of oriented homology 3-spheres. Indeed, we first associate to \mathscr{F} the corresponding collection of 2-fold covers of the 3-sphere branched over the elements of \mathscr{F} and then introduce definite cobordisms from the aforementioned covers of the satellites to a number of Seifert fibered homology spheres. This allows us to apply Furuta's criterion and thus obtain a condition that guarantees the independence of the family \mathscr{F} in the smooth concordance group.
