We continue our study of the degree of the colored Jones polynomial under knot cabling started in "Knot Cabling and the Degree of the Colored Jones Polynomial" (arXiv:1501.01574). Under certain hypothesis on this degree, we determine how the Jones slopes and the linear term behave under cabling. As an application we verify Garoufalidis' Slope Conjecture and a conjecture of the authors for cables of a two-parameter family of closed 3-braids called 2-fusion knots.
