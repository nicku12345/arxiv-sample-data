Let LHT be a left handed trefoil knot and K be any knot. We define M_n(K) to be the homology 3-sphere which is represented by a simple link of LHT and LHT \sharp K with framings 0 and n respectively. Starting with this link, we construct homotopy K3 and spin rational homology K3 surfaces containing M_n(K). Then we apply the adjunction inequality to show that if n>2g^n_s(K)-2, M_n(K) does not bound any smooth spin rational 4-ball, and that under the same assumption the negative n-twisted Whitehead double of LHT \sharp K is not a slice knot, where g^n_s(K) is the n-shake genus of K.
