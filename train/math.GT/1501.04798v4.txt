Let (\mathcal{V},\mathcal{W};F) be a weakly reducible, unstabilized, Heegaard splitting of genus at least three in an orientable, irreducible 3-manifold M. Then Mod(M,F) naturally acts on the disk complex \mathcal{D}(F) as a group action. In this article, we prove if F is topologically minimal and its topological index is two, then the orbit of any element of \mathcal{D}(F) for this group action consists of infinitely many elements. Moreover, we prove there are at most two elements of \mathcal{D}(F) whose orbits are finite if the genus of F is three.
