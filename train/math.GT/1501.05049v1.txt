In this paper we investigate the virtual string links via a probabilistic interpretation. This representation can be used to distinguish some virtual string links from classical string links. In order to study the algebraic structure behind this probabilistic interpretation we introduce the notion of virtual flat biquandle. The cocycle invariants associated with virtual flat biquandle is discussed.
