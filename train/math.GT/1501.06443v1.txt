We study the covolumes of arithmetic lattices in PSL_2(\mathbb R)^n for n\geq 2 and identify uniform and non-uniform irreducible lattices of minimal covolume. More precisely, let \mu be the Euler-Poincar\'e measure on PSL_2(\mathbb R)^n and \chi=\mu/2^n. We show that the Hilbert modular group PSL_2(\mathfrak o_{k_{49}})\subset PSL_2(\mathbb R)^3, with k_{49} the totally real cubic field of discriminant 49 has the minimal covolume with respect to \chi among all irreducible lattices in PSL_2(\mathbb R)^n for n\geq 2 and is unique such lattice up to conjugation. The uniform lattice of minimal covolume with respect to \chi is the normalizer \Delta_{k_{725}}^u of the norm-1 group of a maximal order in the quaternion algebra over the unique totally real quartic field with discriminant 725 ramified exactly at two infinite places, which is a lattice in PSL_2(\mathbb R)^2. There is exactly one more lattice in PSL_2(\mathbb R)^2 and exactly one in PSL_2(\mathbb R)^4 with the same covolume as \Delta_{k_{725}}^u, which are the Hilbert modular groups corresponding to \mathbb Q(\sqrt{5}) and k_{725}. The two lattices \Delta_{k_{725}}^u and PSL_2(\mathfrak o_{\mathbb Q(\sqrt{5})}) have the smallest covolume with respect to the Euler-Poincar\'e measure among all arithmetic lattices in G_n for all n\geq 2. These results are in analogy with Siegel's theorem on the unique minimal covolume (uniform and non-uniform) Fuchsian groups and its generalizations to various higher dimensional hyperbolic spaces due to Belolipetsky, Belolipetsky-Emery, Stover and Emery-Stover.
