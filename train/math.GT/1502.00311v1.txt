Let S_g denote the closed orientable surface of genus g. We construct exponentially many mapping class group orbits of collections of 2g+1 simple closed curves on S_g which pairwise intersect exactly once, extending a result of the first author and further answering a question of Malestein-Rivin-Theran. To distinguish such collections up to the action of the mapping class group, we analyze their dual cube complexes in the sense of Sageev. In particular, we show that for any even k between \lfloor g/2 \rfloor and g, there exists such collections whose dual cube complexes have dimension k, and we prove a simplifying structural theorem for any cube complex dual to a collection of curves on a surface pairwise intersecting at most once.
