By using the cohomology theory of quandles, quandle cocycle invariants and shadow quandle cocycle invariants are defined for oriented links and surface-links via broken surface diagrams. By using symmetric quandles, symmetric quandle cocycle invariants are also defined for unoriented links and surface-links via broken surface diagrams. A marked graph diagram is a link diagram possibly with 4-valent vertices equipped with markers. S. J. Lomonaco, Jr. and K. Yoshikawa introduced a method of describing surface-links by using marked graph diagrams. In this paper, we give interpretations of these quandle cocycle invariants in terms of marked graph diagrams, and introduce a method of computing them from marked graph diagrams.
