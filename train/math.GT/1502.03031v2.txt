Let p be a branched covering of a Riemann surface to the Riemann sphere \mathbb{P}^1, with branching set B \subset \mathbb{P}^1. We define the complexity of p as infinity, if \mathbb{P}^1 \setminus B does not admit a hyperbolic structure, or the product of its degree and the hyperbolic area of \mathbb{P}^1 \setminus B, otherwise. The topological complexity of a surface S is defined as the infimum of the set of all complexities of branched coverings M \to \mathbb{P}^1, where M is a Riemann surface homeomorphic to S. We prove that if S is a connected, closed, orientable surface of genus g, then its topological complexity, C_{\text{top}}(S), is given by:   \[C_{\text{top}}(S)= \left\{ \begin{array}{cl} 2\pi(2g+1) & \mbox{if } g \geq 1, 6 \pi & \mbox{if } g=0. \end{array} \right.\]
