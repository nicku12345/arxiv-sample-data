We take advantage of the correspondence between fibered links, open book decompositions and contact structures on a closed connected 3-dimensional manifold to determine a mixed link diagram presentation for a particular fibered link L in the lens space L(p,q). Moreover, we construct a diagram for the lift of L in the 3-sphere S^3 in order to show that, for q=1, L is compatible with the standard contact structure of L(p,1) when p \leq -1.
