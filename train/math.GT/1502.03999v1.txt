The aim of this article is to study the existence of certain reducible, metabelian representations of knot groups into \mathrm{SL}(n,\mathbf{C}) which generalise the representations studied previously by G.~Burde and G.~de Rham. Under specific hypotheses we prove the existence of irreducible deformations of such representations of knot groups into \mathrm{SL}(n,\mathbf{C}).
