The purpose of this paper is to survey the structure of closed and transitive transformation groups acting on a closed surface. In particular, we prove a number of relations between groups acting on the sphere that contain the rotation group, together with a diagram of how these groups are connected. In addition, we describe transformation groups acting on the torus and higher genus surfaces.
