Given any closed, connected, orientable 3--manifold and integers g\geq g(M), D > 0, we show the existence of knots in M whose genus g bridge number is greater than D. These knots lie in a page of an open book decomposition of M, and the proof proceeds by examining the action of the map induced by the monodromy on the arc and curve complex of a page. A corollary is that there are Berge knots of arbitrarily large genus one bridge number.
