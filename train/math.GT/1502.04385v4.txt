We consider the possible Euler characteristics and fundamental groups of the complementary components X and Y of an embedding of a connected closed 3-manifold M in S^4. We use a 2-knot satellite construction to change the fundamental groups, and Massey products to limit the values of \chi(X) and \chi(Y) when M is the total space of an S^1-bundle with orientable base and Euler number 1.
