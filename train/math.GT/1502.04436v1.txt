We study knots of order 2 in the grope filtration \{\G_h\} and the solvable filtration \{\F_h\} of the knot concordance group. We show that, for any integer n\ge4, there are knots generating a \Z_2^\infty subgroup of \G_n/\G_{n.5}. Considering the solvable filtration, our knots generate a \Z_2^\infty subgroup of \F_n/\F_{n.5} (n\ge2) distinct from the subgroup generated by the previously known 2-torsion knots of Cochran, Harvey, and Leidy. We also present a result on the 2-torsion part in the Cochran, Harvey, and Leidy's primary decomposition of the solvable filtration.
