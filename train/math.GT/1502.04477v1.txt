We define invariants for colored oriented spatial graphs by generalizing CM invariants, which were defined via non-integral highest weight representations of U_q(sl_2). We apply the same method to define Yokota's invariants, and we call these invariants Yokota type invariants. Then we propose a volume conjecture of the Yokota type invariants of plane graphs which relates to volumes of hyperbolic polyhedra corresponding to the graphs, and check it numerically for some square pyramids and pentagonal pyramids.
