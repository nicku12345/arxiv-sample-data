Let f:S^2\to S^2 be an orientation-preserving branched covering map of degree d\geq 2, and let \Sigma be an oriented Jordan curve passing through the critical values of f. Then \Gamma:=f^{-1}(\Sigma) is an oriented graph on the sphere. In a group email discussion in Fall 2010, W. Thurston introduced balanced planar graphs and showed that they combinatorially characterize all such \Gamma, where f has 2d-2 distinct critical values. We give a detailed account of this discussion, along with some examples and an appendix about Hurwitz numbers.
