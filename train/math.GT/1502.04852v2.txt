We discuss an "extrinsic" property of knots in a 3-subspace of the 3-sphere S^3 to characterize how the subspace is embedded in S^3. Specifically, we show that every knot in a subspace of the 3-sphere is transient if and only if the exterior of the subspace is a disjoint union of handlebodies, i.e. regular neighborhoods of embedded graphs, where a knot in a 3-subspace of S^3 is said to be transient if it can be moved by a homotopy within the subspace to the trivial knot in S^3. To show this, we discuss relation between certain group-theoretic and homotopic properties of knots in a compact 3-manifold, which can be of independent interest. Further, using the notion of transient knot, we define an integer-valued invariant of knots in S^3 that we call the transient number. We then show that the union of the sets of knots of unknotting number one and tunnel number one is a proper subset of the set of knots of transient number one.
