An L-space link is a link in S^3 on which all sufficiently large integral surgeries are L-spaces. We prove that for m, n relatively prime, the r-component cable link K_{rm,rn} is an L-space link if and only if K is an L-space knot and n/m \geq 2g(K)-1. We also compute HFL-minus and HFL-hat of an L-space cable link in terms of its Alexander polynomial. As an application, we confirm a conjecture of Licata regarding the structure of HFL-hat for (n,n) torus links.
